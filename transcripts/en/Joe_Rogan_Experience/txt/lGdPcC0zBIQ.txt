Speaker 1:          00:00:02       Four, three, two, one. Boom. And we're live. Gentlemen. Sam Majid. How are you? Good. Thanks. Pleasure to meet you. Pleasure Joe for coming here. Yeah, I'm very happy to get you guys together. I mean that was, I've been kind of looking at to do this for at least two years and finally it's arrived. What's been your ultimate goal? Like what was it? Well, he been. Module is just a superstar that needs more exposure. I mean, he's like, like he should be running half of civilization. I mean he's, he's really fantastically ethical. You can put it in the back of a book, isn't it? Yeah. But you should. Shouldn't put that one. Has to be in the back of the book for sure. Definitely not in the front. People will read it and go, superstar of. I can't blow up the book we wrote together unfortunately. So yeah, that is an issue to kind sam.

Speaker 1:          00:00:46       Thank you very generously. Um, are you, are you, are you suing the southern Poverty Law Center? Is that what's going on? Yeah, in fact, have an update for everybody because we crowd funded a lot of the early costs for the case against the southern poverty law center. What did they do? What does it, what does it make that comment please? Once upon a time, yours truly, a British Muslim of Pakistani origin was listed in the United Kingdom on the Thomson Reuters well-check database under a category red terrorism designation while at the same time being listed across the Atlantic in the United States by the southern poverty law center as an anti Muslim extremists. So I was both a Muslim terrorists and an anti Muslim extremist according to two separate lists and of course that speaks to some of the polarization in our times in how irrational this conversation around extreme Islam, Islam integration, Muslims in the West has become.

Speaker 1:          00:01:46       I sued Thomson Reuters. Well, check the database. This database is no joke, it's like HSBC and and many, many other banks use this database for background checks on where the clients can have a bank account with them. So as a result of, for example, Thomson Reuters in their database, Quilliam, which is a counter extremism organization I founded 10 years ago, had his bank accounts shut down in the United States because of the Thomson Reuters wild check database system that HSBC subscribes to. Anyway, we sued them. They paid damages, they issued an apology and they, uh, took my name off this terrorism designation list they have on their well check database module. I think maybe you should back up further and just give your, kind of your short form bio in terms of, well why would you ever be on a terrorist watch list? I'll do that. Um, but at the same time, the southern poverty law center had listed me, as I said, as an anti Muslim extremist.

Speaker 1:          00:02:39       So we are also, uh, taking legal action against them. And um, I, I will get to your point, but I think just want to say that the. I've just held the law firm on retainer lock and they were the ones that sued the Rolling Stone magazine for that college rape scandal. Yep, that's right. Successfully got won that case. Claire Lock, which is an announcement made here exclusively with you. No one else knows this yet. We have retained Claire Lock. They are writing to the southern poverty law center as we speak. Um, I think they've got wind of it, the southern poverty law center as of I think either yesterday or the day before, they've removed the entire list that's been up there for two years. They've removed the entire list, which also had Ayaan Hirsi Ali on it and it's no longer available on their website. Now, is there logic that if you're a critic of Islam, a radical fundamentalist Islam that you are somehow or another or racist extremist?

Speaker 1:          00:03:34       So that's pretty much what they've said. If you criticize Islam ion myself who have come from within the community and you've had that experience that somehow that makes us anti Muslim, there are a number of logical areas involved in that logical leap that they've made. Do they have any distinction or is there anything that they write that sort of points to why they would say that? Uh, one of them, honestly, the reasons they listed, one of them was that I had a bachelor party in a strip club a year before I got married. That makes you an anti Muslim extremists. That was one of the reasons listed. Oh, nine slash 11 hijackers, hijackers were they really listed that I actually listed that, which is part of the reason why we can prove malice because what has that got to do with anything but that doesn't.

Speaker 1:          00:04:24       Yeah, that doesn't make any sense. Yeah. So that was, that was a primary reason. It was one of the three main reasons that you listed. And another one was again, false. Uh, they claimed that I had called for the criminalization of the face veil for Muslim women in the West, which wasn't true. I had called for a policy to be adopted were in banks and airports where you're not allowed to wear a motorcycle helmet. You also shouldn't be allowed to cover your face, a face in the name of religion, which is very different according to the criminalization, per se of the face veil. That's like saying you're not allowed to wear a motorcycle helmet and the bank. So I believe in the criminalization of motorcycle helmets. It's just absurd. It's ridiculous. So it was a mischaracterization of my opinion. The artist to. Yep. And the other one, uh, the, the reason they don't even read because they kept changing their reasons at the actual website has been, um, we've got the archive and it's been, they've been changing it each time.

Speaker 1:          00:05:16       People have been pointing out the stupidity of their allegations. So why do they exist? What is the southern poverty law center's. I mean, this is a painful irony because if you roll back the clock now, you know, 20 or some odd years there reasons to exist were great. I mean this was the flagship organization that was suing the KKK and sovereign citizens and just the, the far right white nationalists, Christian nationalist movements in the US and in some cases to great effect. And their, and their concern obviously about extremists hate groups in the US was totally valid. And I mean, it was, it became, I mean, now, now that we will see how morally

Speaker 2:          00:05:58       confused they are, people who have been shining a light on them and they, they've, they're this bloated organization that's been taken way too much money and there, I mean, it's not, it, it suffers from other signs of, of corruption or conflicts of interest. But back in the day, you know, Morris dees was bringing the KKK to court and bankrupt in their various chapters and that, that looked fantastic. And now the social justice warrior moral panic, moral stupidity virus has gotten into their brains and they can't differentiate someone like Majid from a right wing Christian, Neo Nazi hater of Islam, right? Or hater of, of, of people from the Middle East. Uh, and, and so it is with Ayaan Hirsi Ali and have a. now, ironically, you're off the website. Now I'm on it. I think I'm on it in a far more transitory way. But the article that was written about my podcast with Charles Murray by vox hit the southern poverty law center hate watch page. And so there you had articles about Neo Nazi groups, articles about the Austin bomber, and then me and, and my podcast with Charles Murray. I definitely want to talk about that, but I want to give people your background first, the reason why you were on the list in the UK and in the first year

Speaker 1:          00:07:15       he's had to do with your actual background. So I was born and raised in Essex in the United Kingdom. And I came of age in what I now refer to as the battle days of racism in the United Kingdom. Much has changed since then for the good. But in those days there were a serious, uh, cases of violent racism that I've faced. A hammer attacks, machete attacks by actual neonazis. I mean, I've grown up. This is the irony of this southern poverty law center listing. I've grown up fighting neo Nazis on the streets and they've been attacking me with hammers and machetes because of the color of my skin. And you've got a bunch of white guys in Alabama, a designating me in the same breath as they would designate, designate these neo Nazis. But that when I grew up in having that experience being falsely arrested by Essex police on a number of occasions, profiled while the genocide in Bosnia was unfolding against Muslims in Bosnia, I often say to an American audience, when I'm speaking about this, we all now here with you on the West Coast in this beautiful new studio you have, congratulations and imagine the genocide was unfolding on the east coast against a group of people with whom you identified and even if it's just on a human level, human beings, but you know, even within a community identification would impact you in a way.

Speaker 1:          00:08:29       For example, if you define yourself as a Jewish and there was a genocide against Jews on the other side of this continent, of this very country, how it would impact you on, on the west coast. Well, sorry over, sorry. Eva. From London, it takes us less time to fly from London to Bosnia than it does from New York to La. And so it really had a profound impact on Muslims across Europe when that genocide was unfolding and things were never the same again. It radicalize an entire generation, of course, ideology

Speaker 3:          00:08:56       had a lot to do with that, but the anger originally came from the genocide. So at the age of 16, what with the domestic racism and the situation in Bosnia unfolding as it did, I joined his battalion, which is a, uh, a non terrorist still legal in America and in Britain and across Europe, a Islamist organization. It was the first of the global Islamist organizations that aspire to resurrect the notion of a caliphate, a which we've subsequently seen to great damaging effect in the form of Isis Caliphate. And, uh, the method of coming to power. It was by infiltrating militaries in Muslim majority countries, uh, recruiting army officers and then instigating military coups, whether that be in Turkey and Pakistan and Egypt. These are the countries they, they targeted and their aim would be to them through the military coup, set up this caliphate, which would then be an expansionist caliphate.

Speaker 3:          00:09:49       Uh, and we'll conquer the world. I mean, that's, it sounds crazy. That's what they believe. And that's what they're very, very serious and intent on bringing about. And now people, when I say that, believe me because they've seen the isis experiment unfold, but I joined a group that sought to do that. Um, through non terroristic means are the age of 16. I ended, ended up on the leadership of that organization in the UK. UH, ended up co founding that group in Pakistan in 1999 where I went, I left the UK, went to Pakistan, was among the first, the vanguard of British Pakistani members that went out there to set the group up. Uh, they've been about three or four a cupelets in Pakistan since an army officers had been arrested for being members of this group and many of them still in jail. I spent a year in Pakistan, went back while studying for my degree in the University of London, would fly Monday, would fly on Saturdays and Sundays to Copenhagen in Denmark.

Speaker 3:          00:10:43       I cofounded the Danish Pakistani chapter of this group. And then the third year of my degree because I was doing law and Arabic, uh, resulted in me having to go to an Arab country for the language you. And so I chose Egypt. And, uh, a day before the nine slash 11 attacks in 2001 I ended up in Egypt. I went to Alexandria, enrolled in the University of Alexandria to study for the year of Arabic language, which was a third year of my degree. Um, of course nine slash 11 happened. And the climate changed. The security climate change all over the world. Something we didn't know about nor predicted. And on the first of April, 2002, my house in Alexandria was rated by the Egyptian state security. I was blindfolded. My hands were tied behind my back. I was then driven through the desert into Cairo, to the dungeon of the state security headquarters in a building known as a, as a LG has, which is the main headquarters of an adult.

Speaker 3:          00:11:38       This internal state security. We were held in the dungeons there for four days and they electrocuted most of the prisoners that they had. They're tortured them interrogate to them. On the fourth day, I was taken to a prison, known as muzzled Artora in Cairo, put into solitary confinement for about three and a half months. Then charged, eventually sentenced to five years as a political prisoner under the Egyptian emergency law. Um, and serve my full sentence there in Egypt, uh, eventually left prison in 2006 and returned to the UK. So, so did, did Amnesty International gets you out at all or they know they only can interest in paying for my release. Nobody got me out because that's a finished my full prison sentence. Um, but what changed me and led to me to be the man that sits before you today is, you're right, Sam Amnesty's adoption of me and, and, and a few others in the case as prisoners of conscience.

Speaker 3:          00:12:38       And they took the very brave and bold step. Now looking back at it, because keep in mind the context here. This is Bush was president. Tony Blair was prime minister and we were in the thick of the war on terror. We were in the middle of it and um, I'm gonna see comes along and says we disagree with everything this guy stands for, but they don't believe in using violence to bring their caliphate about. And so we will defend their right to say stupid things and they shouldn't be in prison, they certainly shouldn't have been tortured for it. So I'm amnesty adopted us as prisoners of conscience and I was 24 years old at the time, by the way. So everything I've just described to you happened to me up until the age of 24 when I was in prison. And it was the first time in my relatively young life from 40 now, right.

Speaker 3:          00:13:17       And, uh, I had never been defended by any mainstream pillar of mainstream society in that way before. Nobody had spoken out for me. And that had a, a real huge kind of emotional impact on my psyche. Um, I've said in my autobiography that where the hot leads, the mind can follow. And so I was now willing to consider alternatives because of amnesties work campaigning for me. And so I spent the next four years in prison, uh, reading, rereading Orwell, uh, every one of his books, reading Tolkien, reading classic English literature, studying Islamic theology, really trying to understand the world around me. Um, and I had four years to do so. And I spent four years debating and discussing with, um, pretty much the founders of Egypt's manger, hottest organizations who are in jail with me in the same prison, including the assassins or the former president, Anwar Sadat, who had been killed in 1981 because of his peace deal with Israel and his assassins were in jail with me and they'd been in prison longer than I've been alive.

Speaker 3:          00:14:15       And so they had some collective years of wisdom between them and most of those jihadis, prisoners I was in jail with, had over the course of those years to decades and more change their views and reformed. They will still conservative religious Muslims something which I'm not. Um, and I never, I don't claim to be in my, in my work at the moment, um, but they were still religious Muslims, but there were no longer a extremists and they were no longer what I call Islamists. People that sought to implement their version of Islam over society. And so they are in four years of constant debate and discussion with them. People that I knew had more wisdom than me. They'd been

Speaker 1:          00:14:52       in jail for longer than I've been alive. I my views began slowly changing. I read a lot of the books they wrote about changing their own views and why they changed and upon my release I, I eventually a good few months after my release, I had to leave the organization because I no longer believed in an ideology that I was prepared to die for. That is fascinating that the shift came about in jail. Speaking with assassin's among many others. Yeah. That. That is really incredible. You would think that most people think that when someone goes to jail usually whatever criminality that they have in them as segmented and hardened. Yeah. I'm. I don't know why mine is an exceptional case because most people, you're right. Whether you look at say cotto who's known as the founding father of modern day jihadism, he started off like me, a non terrorist Islamist, but in Egypt's jails.

Speaker 1:          00:15:40       In fact, the very gentle I was held in, he was tortured and he ended up becoming the godfather of modern day terrorism through his book milestones or Marlin, three in Arabic, and yet that in my case, for whatever reason, I kind of went that bit further to question everything I believed in, but that's not normal in most cases. When you torture people in jail, it ends up hardening and ossifying that ideology and people become as angry as you know, they become the monster that they were seeking to defeat. So you get out of jail, what do you do then? So I left the group in 2007 and by 2008 in January. So I finished my degree. I had one year left of my undergraduate degree. I graduated, I did my masters at the London School of Economics and political theory and while doing the master's setup Quilliam and Quilliam, we, we bill as the world's first counter extremism organization.

Speaker 1:          00:16:33       It was meant to be, we believe it is bringing us back to the SPLC, his allegation, a Muslim response to extremism from people that have lived it and been through it. Um, my co founders were, isn't mrs themselves who changed like me, uh, Muslims born and raised, uh, come from the community to have a community based response, a Muslim response to this growing problem of extremism. And this was 10 years ago and Isis emerged since then, only demonstrating why this kind of response was needed. And so for the southern poverty law center to designate somebody with my background, with that trajectory, with somebody who was prepared to die for this cause. And so somebody who wanted to address these problems as a Muslim to call for reform for the good of my communities as opposed to against them, you know, at the end of the day it can only benefit Muslim communities of extremism is put back in its box. Um, for them to then list someone like me as an anti Muslim extremists. It just really does shine a light on the truth, certainty of the situation we find ourselves in absurdity. And the lack of real investigation or backing up their claims with actual facts and information. And that brings me to your story with Charles Murray and vox and Ezra Klein was linger here for a moment that it's the same problem,

Speaker 2:          00:17:50       but not only is it a lack of investigation, but when it gets pointed out, and I forgot the guy's name at the SPLC who was quarterback in this, but it wasn't more as ds, but it was someone high up mark, the poetic or the CEO of something coed I think is the. Yeah, I thought it was mark. Anyways, he's listed in the. He's named in the Atlantic article that first put this on our radar, but he. They just doubled down. I mean the, the, the, the error cannot be pointed out clearly enough to trigger and much less than apology, a, any modulation of the claim. They just. People just doubled down in the face of obvious counter evidence and that's, it's just not about a sincere engagement with the problem. And there's. And there's this and there's so many variables here that make it make it a really toxic environment.

Speaker 2:          00:18:40       But one is that the, the, the locus of concern is never the individual. It is the group is the tribe and so you can. It's like they'll sacrifice any number of individuals to make the political case. They want to make a so they don't completely unrepentant when they're shown to get it wrong. And so in your case and an ions case, it's just such a such a grievous moral lapse because not only is it is the attack on you illegitimate, it actually raises your, your security concerns and it it. It becomes a reference point for journalists who are confused, who can't follow the plot or don't have the time to, to fact check everything. It makes you radioactive from the point of view of mainstream journalists because either they go to the southern poverty law center site to figure out who's worth talking to and they see a page where you're listed as a anti Muslim extremist along with people who bear very little resemblance to you ideologically. Because there's probably a few people on there who who could be described as anti Muslim extremists. And here are the 10 people you don't need to talk to about this problem, whereas you're actually one of the most valuable voices. I mean objectively one of the most valuable voices, but probably, you know, I can probably count on two fingers, you know, anyone who would rival your voice on this topic. Uh, so it's, it's just mind boggling.

Speaker 3:          00:20:06       It's very difficult trying to keep this my closest. Yeah. It's very difficult. You can swing it towards. You can tweak it to say it's very difficult because, um, icon can't. I can't fully explain to anybody what it feels like to have lived an entire life from roughly the age of 14 being consumed by this issue of Muslims in the west and this question. And originally getting it, answering it in one way, and then still being consumed by the topic, answering it in a different way. As I now do, I can't describe to anybody how much emotionally the toll that it takes to have your whole life have defined your whole life by trying to answer this question and because you for it. Because

Speaker 1:          00:20:48       this is a question that concerns you when I joined these limits group, I did. I was wrong and adopted some really nefarious ideas, but did so because I gave a damn and cared for a genocide that I saw unfolding and desperately wanted a solution. So even when I became an Islamist, I did so out of care and love and concern for what I believed was my community under attack. So to have a bunch of people come along and say that I am anti the very community that I've believer of. I have fought for all my life, you know, and have and my life has been consumed and defined by this. It really is taking the one thing away from somebody that they have. I mean, I went to jail for this thing. I have people have died in front of my eyes from the torture wounds in prison because of this thing.

Speaker 1:          00:21:35       To have someone completely ignorant in that way, to, to deprive me of having the, of being able to claim that I have stood for my community. But by instead saying that I'm anti that community, it really does kind of make you feel like crap. Jo, when did this start happening? This moral panic that you've constantly discussed in these flippant sort of accusations without real. Any real solid objective reasoning behind calling someone like you or Ion Hirsi Ali, who's the victim of female genital mutilation to say that she's an anti Muslim, that she's Islamophobic is. It seems to me it's almost insane, but it seems to me to be prevalent. This is something that is a common sentiment today that I don't recall ever seeing anything like this one or two decades ago.

Speaker 2:          00:22:30       Yeah. We might have a better sense than I do, but I don't. It's become increasingly salient to me just because I've been doing this work for better or worse and colliding with these people more and more. But, uh, it's, it's definitely an export from some trends in intellectual life that go back 50 years or more. I mean, they always, oh, what postmodernism did, and I mean, you can go back further than that. It's just there. There's a, there's a, a framework, a kind of pseudo intellectual framework where facts can't be talked about as facts. They're, they're intrinsically political. They intrinsically convey power disparities. Um, you know, science is just a tool of power sort of thinking, and this goes back a ways, but it is, it's now seemingly ascendant on the left in a way that is, is just fairly bewildering amount. It seems to be only two subjects. Gender and race. Those are the ones that get. Those are the big ones. I think it's, I'm sure we could find more if we take a minute to think about it, but there are, those are, those are, those certainly dwarf every other.

Speaker 1:          00:23:41       Those are the ones where there's a wall, there's a wall that you can't get through with reason

Speaker 2:          00:23:45       that this isn't quite raised. This is the way it's drawn. A lot of energy from concerns about racism. Identity. It is. The perception is that Muslims are a politically beleaguered minority that have to be. So it is like, it is a great. I mean people think there's, you know, it's racist to criticize Islam. Has that made any sense? I mean, you know, Ben Affleck being one, but it is, you know, this is their minority in Los Angeles. They're not a minute. The second biggest religion on earth this is we're talking about one point 7 billion people in there and the criticism of Muslim extremism for the most part is focused on societies where you have most cases, a majority Muslim population, you have women and gays and, and freethinkers treated terribly. And that's, that. That is the, you know, the center of the Bullseye in terms of, you know, what, what one is criticizing when one talks about the accuracy.

Speaker 3:          00:24:45       So I, that there was a lot of this stuff. There's some, this paranoia, this son of a irrational approach, this conversation that Sam suffered from and when, when, when I first met him, uh, I Miss New York at the intelligence squared debate that heat that. So Ayaan Hirsi Ali and Douglas Murray, who I believe you've had. Yes. On this podcast, we're on one side of a debate. I was on the other side of this debate and the motion that we were debating was Islam is a religion of peace. I was back then arguing, well, half of my true belief is because I actually don't believe it's a religion of peace or war, it's just a religion that is interpreted in different ways, but I had to pick a side and so I picked that side in defending the motion and an a on an will on the other side. And there was a, there was a dinner afterwards for the speakers and Sam was there. And imagine you were there as a guest. Yeah. Um, and so it's my, well, I didn't know who he was at a, on an I were locked in conversation, post debate conversation and uh, uh, ion invited Samhsa to have his say and she said, I want to hear what Sam Harris has to say. And so

Speaker 2:          00:25:54       context is relevant. So we're at. So we had a public, he's seen these intelligence squared debates that are there, very well produced online. I don't know that they're televised anymore, but they're online. They're, they get a great theater in Manhattan and you know, as an audience, maybe a thousand people and, and John Donvan the journalist is the impresario. And, but then this was a dinner afterwards, were the organizers and the participants been there, there may be 70 people in the back room of a restaurant and Majid Nih, we're not at the same table, thankfully we were like 50 feet away from each other but facing each other. And so he was at the table with ion and the other speakers and at one point that everyone's getting debriefed about how this went. And Ion says why a Sam Harris is here. I'd like to hear what he has to say about the debate.

Speaker 2:          00:26:42       And so I look at my budget and he's okay. He's either at least 50 feet away from me and I'm a. I mean, do you want me to say what I, you? So I would say so he had made moves in this debate that I considered intellectually dishonest. And, and I mean, he, he's, he's playing a game and this is not a real conversation. This is a formal academic style of debate where his job is not to leave his view open to influenced by the other discussions. He's, he's making a case. Um, uh, and I didn't know it at the time, but he felt unnaturally constrained by the format of the debate. He had to argue that Islam is a religion of peace and some of the moves he made there I thought were dishonest. And so I said, I'm a mom and I remember this more or less verbatim because we talked about, and we've since transcribe it into a book, but, um, I said, Majid know everyone in this room recognizes that you have the hardest job in the world and we're all very glad that you're doing it.

Speaker 2:          00:27:41       You have to somehow convince the next generation of Muslims that Islam really is a religion of peace and the jihad is just an inner spiritual struggle and that it'd be martyrs don't get 72 virgins in paradise and all the rest. And so my question for you is, is this, do you really believe that, that this is the case now? Or do you, do you think that pretending that is the, that is the case, is the method by which you will make it the case that if you just pretend long enough and hard enough, it'll become so

Speaker 3:          00:28:13       and the extra line here was. And can you just be honest with us in the privacy of my final sentence was,

Speaker 2:          00:28:18       and you know, we're not on, we're not televised now, can you just be honest with us here? And uh,

Speaker 3:          00:28:23       so, so I responded immediately and said, are you calling me a liar? And

Speaker 2:          00:28:28       Seventy we now 70 people and I'm like into my second gin and tonic and, and he's given me the sort of Middle Eastern stare down across.

Speaker 3:          00:28:39       You repeat today said, no, no, I'm asking you just hear that where there's no cameras, can you just be honest with us? And I said, are you calling me a liar? And it didn't go too well at all. The entire, everyone on the table kind of went quiet and I didn't know who this guy was. I never met him and I should have known who he was. And then I think somebody are very tactfully changed the conversation and just completely veered off this. And I'd never, I never spoke to them again for another, what was it, a couple of three years we'd never crossed paths in San. And the reason I bring this up is that I was one of those guys that didn't want to entertain a conversation with Sam, uh, based upon the defensiveness when it came to this topic. And I think that actually it's important to say that to people that because you asked him a question about the Charles Murray situation, a lot of people, rather than actually wanting to engage with someone on the substance of their ideas, that I think in the climate we're in today, they're engaging with people based upon their, on their feelings.

Speaker 3:          00:29:36       And those feelings are valid. Of course everyone has the right to their feelings. But we've got to try as hard as we to detach

Speaker 1:          00:29:42       those feelings from because that's clearly not what the principle of charity means. You lend the person that you're speaking to the best possible interpretation of what they're saying and, and, and allow them to clarify what they mean as opposed to you putting into their mouths what, what they mean, and telling them what they mean. I learned that, you know, because then two years later he reaches out to me and he says, I think we can try again. Are you willing to have a conversation with me? And, and I hadn't originally remembered it was the same guy, so that's fine. I got my foot in the door just because you didn't know who I was. And then we had this conversation, which, it's a lesson for me because we had this conversation. It's, it's, it's called Islam in the future of tolerance. It's become a book right?

Speaker 1:          00:30:22       Published by Harvard University Press. We had this conversation that became a book that been made into a film, which I think any couple of weeks now we hear some news on that. It's coming up with that. So we did a lecture tour of Australia and the people who organize that, she made a documentary that we realize this lesson to your question and that is that I am somebody that didn't engage with him on the substance of his question, but actually fired a misfire and emotional misfire on, on, on, on, on what was really questioning his motives for asking the question rather than actually addressing, addressing the points he was making. And I think that when I, because I didn't remember who he was, I then started the conflict conversation in new, uh, without the memory of my original judgment on him and the conversation went really well.

Speaker 1:          00:31:09       So we've got to somehow be able to divorce ourselves from that background. That can happen. I mean, it can be done. It's just, it takes people have strong character to try to like abandon all preconceived notions from the past conversation. Just start fresh. Yeah. I unfortunately, this example of, of a kind of a signal success has, has caused me to, in the end kind of miss band a lot of energies. There's assuming that trying to replicate it. I keep thinking I keep walking into another situation and thinking this is possible. Is that why you deleted twitter? Well, I, yeah, yes. Um, so you haven't deleted your account? I'm still on twitter, but I, I will, uh, based on this reason episode, I use it. They're fascinated by people and their struggles with social media with like detaching from it, reattaching from it, getting addicted to it. I mean I know so many people that will look at their twitter at like 1:00 in the morning before they go to bed and something pisses them off and then they can't sleep really common. I was not, I don't consider myself someone who had a, a, a real pathology with that amount was, you know, I have, I dunno, 6,000 tweets or 7,000 tweets over the course of many years, so I'm not, I was not tweeting that much. I was not even looking that much. I was, I was fairly disengaged and I've never used facebook as a. I've never, I just use. Facebook is kind of a publishing channel. I never engaged with comments, but I was looking

Speaker 2:          00:32:40       enough and it, it was one, it was clearly making me a worse person. I mean, I just, it, I was, I was reacting to stuff that I didn't need to react to and it was amplified in certain criticisms and voices which need not have been amplified. And in this, in this last case, it just turned a create a huge explosion in my life. I was in the middle of a vacation, which I basically torpedoed because of what I saw on twitter and it was just, it was like the perfect infomercial for why you don't want to be engaged with your vacation. How while. So I'm in the middle of the first vacation I've taken with my family for a very long time. It was at least a year and wow. And so, you know, we're on Hawaii and just like I'm supposed to put everything down to be the best father and husband I can be.

Speaker 2:          00:33:32       Right. And that was my intention. That's what was happening. Uh, it happened for a good solid 24 hours and then I pick up my phone and I see that that raises salon and Glenn Greenwald and Ezra Klein had all attacked me in the space of an hour just like now it's, this goes out to millions of people. He was also was asking about the Charles Murray thing. Yeah. Well, truth is, I can't even see what I, I didn't look at what Greenwald had done. Um, he was circulating. Somebody is video about me, how I'm, I think I'm a racist in that video. Reza Aslan blocks me, so I can't even see what if he attacks me by name, but he blocks me so the hay, so I can't even see what his export. But uh, so I, but I just saw the aftermath of that, you know, lots of stuff.

Speaker 2:          00:34:18       Lots of notifications coming to me with both of us tagged. And then Ezra published this. I suppose I should back up a however painful way to describe what happened here. But. So I had Charles Murray on my podcast a year ago and Charles Murray's this, this a social scientist who published the bell curve back in the nineties, which was a book about Iq and, and success in, in western societies like our own. And uh, uh, it's a book where he worries a lot about the cognitive stratification of society. We have a society that is selecting more and more for a narrow band of talents that are fairly well captured by what we call Iq. And there is a kind of winner take all situation where people are really, you know, 500 years ago, if you had a, a very high Iq and you're, you're just pushing a plow next to your neighbor.

Speaker 2:          00:35:10       You had no real advantage. But now you can start a hedge fund or you can start a software company. And we're, we're seeing this real shocking disparity. And in a good fortune, really. Uh, so, uh, he wrote this book, it had a chapter on race which talked about the disparities in, in racial groups, statistically observed disparities. And, uh, the claim about the source of those disparities was by even the standards of the time, but certainly the standards of today and incredibly tepid mealy mouthed, just hand waving. It was not this, you know, here comes the Third Reich Declaration of, of white supremacy. It was undoubtedly, there are environmental engineers, etic reasons for this and we don't understand them, you know, it was just like, to think that is one or the other. We're not in a position to know what the mix is of, of, of influences now. Um, and that is a virtually any honest scientists take on the matter. Um, and certainly today, I mean, it's only become more so, uh, but that went off like a nuclear bomb. I mean, that was just, that was such a, um, uh, I mean it's, it's the most, um, so, and at the time I never read the book, I just thought this had to be.

Speaker 4:          00:36:37       That's cool. It would be vilified for, for that obs and he, he's been vilified ever since then, ever since I've ignored him. He need deep platformed and assaulted recently. So that's what happened. So, so he went to Middlebury to give a talk, you know, 20 some odd years, 25 years after he wrote this book. Oh, by the way, he's also listed by the southern poverty law center and so that, that that's what contributed to the d platforming and the violent protest against him at Middlebury. What's crazy is the whole thing is a propaganda for the superiority of the Asian race and everyone's going to say that they, we'll talk about white supremacy and far and above. I mean, that's basically what his book proved and you know, they're suing Harvard now there's a group of Asian students that are suing Harvard because they're discriminated against because they're required to have higher scores because they're assumed to be smarter.

Speaker 4:          00:37:27       So the standards for Asian students entering into Harvard is higher than white people. Wow. Yes. Well, Asian privilege has a big problem. Yeah. Your grandfather was working on the railroads in California as an indentured servant and all by privileged trickled down. There's obviously a lot of factors that lead to icu to, to hire cute, but to ignore what those are, to ignore it completely to ideology. Yes, exactly. Only ideology and this idea that you cannot look at statistics, you cannot look at facts and in your conversation with Ezra Charles, that sort of or as reclined rather. That's what I got is that this is, this is an ideological issue and that you, you, it's almost like an impossible subject to breach, like you can't even discuss the fact that certain races demonstrate low Iq and then let's look at what could be the cost of those even discussing that somehow or another is so inherently racist that it must be ignored or it must be silenced and that you must first concentrate on all the various injustices that have been done to those people who have this lower Iq. Yeah. Well let me just take a couple minutes to close

Speaker 2:          00:38:36       the various doors. Take owl that are now a jar based on what we've said on your holiday and you get so. So we'll just take a little more context. So yeah, as you said, Charles Murray went to Middlebury College and was d platform and he was not only the platform, so the usual the platform and with the students turning their back to the speaker and shouting and not let anything happen, but the professor who invited him, who is a liberal professor who wanted to essentially debate him, he wants to act when they're leaving the hall, they both get physically attacked by a, a crowd of students. Charles was, was not hurt. His host, a female professor got a concussion and a neck injury that, that still persist and this now more than a year later. So I was like, Shit that she was actually a registered Democrat by this. No doubt.

Speaker 2:          00:39:21       And, and they're driving out in an suv where that gets, I mean someone pulls a stop sign out of the sidewalk and I still got the concrete ball on the end of it and this suv gets smashed with this concrete laid and stop sign. I mean this was, this is happening at one of the most liberal privileged colleges on earth. It's nuts. So anyway, that was the thing that put Marie on my radar after all these many years of my ignoring him and I had actually I felt guilty because I had declined to be a part of at least one project because his name was attached, right? Because I just thought that this guy is radioactive. He's, he's got some white supremacist agenda. I had believed the, the, the, the lies about him. Uh, and then I saw this and I thought, okay, well maybe he is the canary in the coal mine or, or certainly one of the canaries in the coal mine that I had ignored where the, as you say, there's certain topics are considered so politically fraught that you cannot discuss them no matter what is true.

Speaker 2:          00:40:18       Like this is like, it's just a, you know, there has to be a firewall between your conversation about reality and these sorts of facts. Uh, and so, you know, he said he's been suffering from having transgress that boundary. And so I had him on the, on the podcast a being fairly agnostic about his, his actual social policy commitments and his political concerns. And just wanting to talk about, uh, you know, the facts and so far as we touch them lightly, they had zero interest in intelligence, a as measured by Iq a, although it's an interesting subject, but I hadn't, you know, hadn't spent much time focused on that and I had a truly zero interest in establishing differences between populations with respect to intelligence or anything else. But I see what's coming. I see the fact that, that the more we understand ourselves genetically and environmentally, the more we will if we go looking or even if we're not looking, we will discover differences between groups.

Speaker 2:          00:41:24       And the end game for us as a species is not to deny that those differences exist or could possibly exist. It's too deny that they have real political implication. I mean with the, the political employ, the political framework we need is a commitment to, to equality across the board and a commitment to treating individuals as individuals. There's nobody who's the average of a population is meaningless with respect to you. And that will always be so and I'm and whatever, you know, whatever diversity of talents there is statistically in various populations, we want societies that simply don't care politically about that. I mean that's just, it's just not what it's our political tolerance of one another and supportive of one another is not predicated on denying individual differences or even statistical differences across groups. It can't be because we know that there are people walking around like a, you know, Elon musk who gets out of bed every morning and does the work of like 4,000 people.

Speaker 2:          00:42:37       Right? And people who just are struggling to work at starbucks and hold down a job. And our political system, we don't say one person is more valuable politically and socially than another, even though one person is capable of doing massive things that, that, that, that, uh, many, most other people aren't. It's when it comes time to, to write laws and create institutions that protect that, that support human flourishing. We, we have to engineer times that raise all the boats. And so, you know, and, and you know, they're legitimate debates about the social policies that will do that and they're legitimate debates about facts so we can debate scientific fact and, and you know, the, the results of, you know, psychometric testing or, or behavioral genetics that are relevant to this question of intelligence, uh, and we have a good faith debate about the data. And then we can have a good faith debate about social policy that should follow from the data. But what's happening on the left now is on either at either of those two tiers of conversation, there are just straight up allegations of, of, of racism that hits you the moment you touch certain certain. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:43:52       Can I say that? The, that, what he's just summarize that. And what I've heard sounds to me as being more humane than the implications of the argument that the left who were opposing will. Sam has just said, oh, because if you think about it, the implications of their argument would be there. They want to deny the facts because they're scared that those facts

Speaker 2:          00:44:16       word

Speaker 3:          00:44:17       from which there would be derived a policy that would reflect those facts and otherwise in their minds they are marrying those two. They are marrying the notion that if in statistical observance there are variances in Iq between groups

Speaker 4:          00:44:32       in their minds that means the policy should follow from that, so it's why they're resisting what he saying. Whereas what he's saying is there is no connection between what the policy should be and what the facts may be because of the kind of world we want to live in, a should aspire to equality regardless of what the science is saying, because one is policy and one is science. I freely agree with you on that, but I don't think that's necessarily exactly what they're saying. Well, I think what they're saying is, and what they're doing is they almost feel so guilty that any discussion whatsoever about race can't be held unless you repeatedly bring up all the instances of racism and suppression that indiscrimination that that group has suffered from. It's like you can't. It doesn't exist as a statistic island. You have to bring everything in together if you don't do that, that's where their protest comes from and I think that was one of the things that I got from your conversation with another client, wasn't willing to just discuss what's the implication of these issues and completely dismissed this.

Speaker 4:          00:45:32       This fact that Asian people score far better. There is not a. there's not a place for that by, by conceding on the data. It's almost as if they fear that the implication must necessarily follow that the policy will also be supremacist in that way. I wonder. I honestly think what we talked about before is a big part of it is ideological idea sport and that they're just volleying back. I don't think they're willing to take. I think one of the real strengths of character that you demonstrate in a debate or any discussion of facts is when uncomfortable truths rear their ugly head that are counter to your, uh, your personal position. You have to be able to go. You got a really good point. You've got a good point. There's something to that. I see what you're saying. Okay. This is what my concern would be into.

Speaker 4:          00:46:17       This would be a rational, real conversation. This is what I would worry about, and then you would I'm sure say absolutely. I would worry about that as well, and then you would have this sort of a discussion. I didn't get that from that conversation you had. I got ping pong, I got blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. I got this rallying back and forth of ideas rather than two human beings not digging their heels into the sand. Just trying to look at the ideas and look at the statistics and look at these studies for what they are and look at Charles Murray and what he's gone through and should we be able to examine these statistical anomalies should be able to examine athletic superiority. Should we be able to examine a superiority that a Asians show in mathematics and a lot of the sciences, should we. Should we be able to or should we just dig our heads in this? Should we just let things sort themselves out and quietly ignore all the reality? Yeah. I don't know why, so I should say that I am, I certainly understand people's fear that if you, that anyone who would go looking for racial difference is very likely motivated, motivated by something unethical or unsavory. Right. So like, like you could imagine, you know, white supremacists being being super enamored of this

Speaker 2:          00:47:30       possibility that these data says yes and they all. Yes. And so they look at the Asian statistics. Uh, so, so that's, I get that right. And there is some things that, and this was the question I had for Charles Murray on, on that podcast, I said like, why pay attention to any of this? What is the upside in the, in the infinity of, of interesting problems we can tackle scientifically. Why focus on population differences? And you know, frankly, I didn't get a great answer from him and his answer his answer, his answer is, well, I think the best version of his answer, which I agree with, but still it may not justify certain certain uses of attention. It's just that if you, there's this massive bias that I'm basically, we're all working with a blank slate genetically, and therefore any difference you see among people is a matter of, of environment.

Speaker 2:          00:48:29       And so, so then you have people have privileged environments and people who have environments that, that, um, uh, where they're massively under resourced. And so therefore any different representation at the, you know, the higher echelons of success and achievement and power in our society. Uh, you know, if there's 13 percent African Americans in theU , s if you look at the top doctors in hospitals or the top academics or the, um, you know, the Oscar winners or wherever, you know, wherever you want to look for, for, for achievement. If there are less than 13 percent African Americans in any one of those bins, that has to be the result of racism or systemic racism. That is the left, the left word bias at this moment. And so it is with Jews for antisemitism. So it is for women. Um, you know, there should be an equal representation of women in computer, software engineers at Google, at any lack of any disparity.

Speaker 2:          00:49:34       There must be the result of either a just inequitable resources for kids in schools or, or somewhere along the way or I'm kind of a selection pressure from the top that, you know, we, you know, we don't like women in, at Google or blacks at the Oscars. And so that's the. So Marie's concern is if you believe that, and I'm not exactly what he said, but this is, this is what I believe he thinks, but I could be putting some words into his mouth here, but this is certainly what many other people on his side of the debate thing, if you believe that you will, can consistently find racial bias and antisemitism and mysogeny where it doesn't exist. Right? So like if you, if you go look, if you go to a hospital and the, and this is a real problem there, like, like you know, the academic departments in the medical schools at the best medical schools are under massive pressure to find like real diversity in representation at the highest level you need to find a ta head of cardiology, his black right.

Speaker 2:          00:50:40       Um, and if you and you and the fact that you haven't done that is a sign that there's a problem with you and your organization and your process of hiring. Now, if it's just the case for whatever reason, that there are not many candidates likely have less than 13 percent for that field or to take the, you know, the James Damore memo memo at Google, right? If it just is the case that women forget about this, is that this was beyond aptitude. This just goes to interest. If it's the case that women, for whatever reason, genetic and or environmental are less interested in being software engineers on average than men are than you then having 20 percent women's coding software at Google is not the price. It's not Google's problem, it's just the fact that this is the popular, what the population interests are. Now we should no doubt racism still exists, no doubt misogyny and sexism still exists there. There are, I mean there's proof of this to be found as well, but if to assume an absolute uniformity of human, of interest and aptitude in every population you could look at is just scientifically irrational. That would be a miracle

Speaker 4:          00:51:56       that were the case. So at this stage allow me to remind everybody that was sam summarizing what he thinks Charles Murray was saying as opposed to Sam w. no, nope, no. My final point is it's just a true point. Their jeans, almost everything we care about are massively influenced by genes. Not One hundred percent to you though is that people have taken your summaries of other people's stuff, but that wasn't even necessarily Charles Murray's position. Your. It's your summary of his position in relationship to this. This fight against that. The thing that I would add and the thing where there's some daylight between the two of us, me and him

Speaker 2:          00:52:33       on my podcast is this is so toxic to be trafficking in population differences with respect to icu, that and it's not, it's not absolutely clear what social policies turn on really nailing down these differences. I mean, so you could go want me to take it even more toxic as an example. Perhaps it's like you could decide, uh, you know, the Roma in Europe that the Gypsies like this is like a very isolated, beleaguered community. Who knows how in bread it is. Um, I don't know. It's just this is a, this is an outlier community. Like anyone who's going to want to do massive Iq testing on the Roma. What's the, what's the point of doing that? Right? Like, you know, like it seems like a, just a, a kind of political time bomb to devote resources in that way because we know that the policy you want whatever new, whatever this, the main ICU is of any group, the policy you want is to give everyone whatever opportunities they can avail themselves of.

Speaker 2:          00:53:47       So we want, we want people to have the best schools they can use and then we'll find people who need to be in, in more remedial schools for whatever reason, or you know, people like, you know, the one population that has 10 times the amount of dyslexia than another population say, and they'll be undoubtedly genetic reasons for that, you know, there may be environmental reasons for that as well, but there's, we need to be able to cater to all of those needs with just this fundamental commitment to goodwill and equality without being panicked that we'll find stuff that just blows everything up. But on the left there, there's the sense that the only way to move forward toward equality is to lie about what is scientifically pause, plausible and demonize anyone who won't lie with you.

Speaker 2:          00:54:37       That's the ideological point that this is a new thing though, right? I mean, relatively speaking, this, uh, this hard nose stance from the left of the equality of outcome. And, and the only reason why there wouldn't be 50 percent women or 50 percent black, 50 percent in it. You just pick any marginalized group. The only reason why it wouldn't be even across the board with all other races is because of discrimination. This is a fairly new stance. So I mean, there were, there were moments that were fairly well publicized that I don't forget when Larry Summers got fired from Harvard, so Larry Summers was the president of Harvard and he's a famous economist and he gave a speech for which she was fired. Uh, there might be a little more color as to why he was fired. He was fired because he, he wants the wheels started to come off.

Speaker 2:          00:55:23       He didn't, he had alienated enough people that he didn't have friends to kind of prop him up. But, but the thing that pulled the wheels off was that he gave a speech and he said, we know there are, are differences in, in the bell curves that describing a mathematical aptitude between men and women. And this explains why there are many more top flight male mathematicians and engineers than women. And it's not that they even, it's not that the, uh, the means of the, uh, the, the, of the bell curves are different. So the, the means could be the same, but there could be more variant so that the tails are thicker in the case of, of the mail, but bulk herbs, so at the, at the absolute ends, both the, the low end and high end, you have many more people. So you know, if you're, if you're going to ask you what's the in the same size population, how many people do you have at the 99 point nine, nine, nine percentile of aptitude in math. Say it could be that you have and there's,

Speaker 1:          00:56:24       there's a fair amount of data to show this many more men at the tails than women. Right? And, and that's true for grandmasters in chess, right? It's just this is not a, a, and it may be true for something like, you know, playing pool, you know, I mean they're, they're, they're just differences and that may not be entirely environmental. Almost certainly are not entirely environmental. Uh, that is one, right? It's a big issue in the world of pool men and women play separately and there's no reason physically why they shouldn't. Yeah, they're not, it's not a strength game, but women are allowed to play in men's tournaments, but they never. When Jean Baluchis was a woman who was a, she was like one of the only women ever compete and beat men. She's like an extreme outlier and this was like, I want to say it was in the late seventies and eighties.

Speaker 1:          00:57:11       And other than that there's been a few women that have done well in tournaments, but when they come to Major League professional pool tournaments, they're almost always one by men. Um, and um, when I say almost, I mean like 99 point nine percent. So there was a, a Commonwealth Games have been happening as we, it was just over the last couple of weeks and there was a male to female transgender athlete in the weight lifting category. That's a whole nother ball. Participated in the women's competition and the Commonwealth Games at the time of her joining hadn't yet put down a rule asked to testosterone levels in females competing. And so this male to female transgender person qualified in the female games and was as you'd expect, I'm winning in all of the Games and was the front runner and destined to win the competition as a male to female transgender person and the only reason and it would have led to a huge crisis in the Commonwealth Games because there was some resistance to this notion.

Speaker 1:          00:58:12       I'm out. Of course, the questions that arise is this fat men will naturally with higher levels of testosterone. For example. The only reason it didn't lead to the crunch time and that was a huge scandal of, of, of winning is that she injured herself in the competition and by sheer accident. Yeah, I saw that. I can expand on that a little bit because I've actually gone through this extensively because there was a woman who was used to be a man, was competing in mixed martial arts against women and just beating the shit out of them. And I was saying that this is, this is a mistake and that you're. You're looking at whether someone should be legally able to identify as a woman portray themselves. A woman, absolutely. Yeah. Do you have the freedom to become a woman in quotes? In our society? Yes, but you can't deny biological nature and there's physiological advantages to the male frame. There's specifically when it comes to combat sports, that's my wheelhouse. I'm an expert. I understand there's a giant difference between the amount of power that a man and a woman can generate and if you're telling me that a guy living 30 years of his life as a man that's, that's essentially like a woman being on steroids for 30 years. Then getting off and

Speaker 4:          00:59:22       then having regular women being forced to compete with her and try to pretend this a level playing field. It is not. There's a difference in the shape of the hips, the size of the shoulder, the density of the bones, the size of the fists. That's a giant factor in your ability to generate power is the size of your fists. It's also an ethical problem and it's not just competition. Here is he have girls getting beaten up by someone who used to be a man. Yes, but people came down on me harder than anything that I've ever stood up for in my life, never in my life do I think there's going to be a situation where I said, hey, I don't think that guy should be able to get his penis removed and beat the shit out of women, and then people like you're out of line, but that's the summary of this.

Speaker 4:          01:00:03       That's literally what happened. This is a conversation that I had with a woman online as well during this whole thing. She said she, this person who had turned into a woman has always been a woman and I said, but she was a man for 30 years. She goes, no, she's always been a woman. I go, even when she had sex with a woman and fathered a kid and she says, yes. Even then I go, well, we're done because you're just talking nonsense. This is ideology, ideology cover exact. The front says they are just that. She had a male physique. This person who was arguing with me wants to claim this moral high ground of being the most progressive and they're always looking to step on top of anybody who's less progressive than than and complaint and proclaim superiority, and this is the ideological sport. This is the idea sport that you see with what people are playing.

Speaker 4:          01:00:53       Ping Pong with our ideas and not listening you. You need to listen to experts in when you're. Especially when you're talk about martial arts, there's a the the. The difference is so profound and the results are so critical because you're talking about a sport where the objective goal, the goal is clear. It's very clear. Beat the fuck out of the other person in front of you, so anything that would give you an advantage in beating the fuck out of that person should be really looked at very carefully and not thrown through the lens of this progressive ideological filter that we're going through right now because that's what it is. I mean that's how people are looking at it and it's with weightlifting as well. When transgendered athletes going to weightlifting competitions, the male to female transgender athletes are overwhelmingly dominant. I mean, is this, is this a coincidence or it's.

Speaker 4:          01:01:44       No, it's someone who had fucking testosterone pumping through their system and n and a y chromosome their whole life and now all of a sudden we're supposed to say no. She's a woman. She's a. she's dainty. She's got size 14 feet. She's got gorilla hands. Like what in the fuck are we doing? So, so I think as you said earlier, it's she is a woman, but for the purposes of competition against other women, you know, legally she's a woman at that stage. She goes through that identity transition, but I think we have to recognize it. I think even many traditional feminists, I'm making this point much to the angle of the Trans community. They're hold on you. What you're doing in this way is actually we fought so hard and so long for these female spaces where we have a space of our own and that's people that used to be men are coming into those spaces is actually quite literally beating the crap out of us spaces.

Speaker 4:          01:02:34       Whether it's in boxing, whether it's in weight lifting and martial arts, they are, by definition they dominating or this of course they offer what the reasons you've said experts that they're calling upon or almost all transitioned doctors, surgeons or people that have transitioned themselves when they speak to actual board certified endocrinologist and some of the only do it off record, but one of 'em forget her name. She was in one of the big mixed martial arts publications. Ramona crushed sec, I believe is her name. She's saying, no, not only does it it it actually doing this transition like from male to female, you're forcing your. You're putting estrogen into the system, so the bone density change that would ordinarily take place if you removed, so it's testicles and stopped the distance, the production of testosterone. Estrogen preserves bone density, so you're actually retaining the male bone density.

Speaker 4:          01:03:31       There's so many problems with this and that and that was one of the other things. They say, well, oh, the Olympics, the Olympics allow it. The Olympics are very ideologically based. There's not a whole lot of science to this. This transition thing of allowing male to female athletes to compete in the Olympics and there's an extreme amount of corruption in the Olympics as it is with the IOC being in bed with water, the world antidoping agency and the way they handle this Russian scandal, I mean this Russian scandal that was highlighted in that fantastic documentary, icarus like fucking crazy, the Olympics or not to be trusted. That is a gigantic multibillion dollar business where the athletes get paid zero money. It is inherently corrupt from the top down, no doubt about it, so to to call upon them is to see who should be competing as a woman fuck off.

Speaker 4:          01:04:21       They're not the experts. This is. This is not something that's been examined and this is coming from someone who. One of my jobs is examining and commentating on fights. That is a big part of what I do. I understand fights and I know what it looks like when a man's beating the shit out of a woman and that's what it looked like when this person was fighting women. It was. There was a massive physical advantage, massive, not a skill advantage. What was the, you mentioned something about the reaction that you got to that. What was the trouble you're going to insult? People are so mad at me. I mean it was just so many. Not only that, they took my words out of context. They quoted all these different gender transition doctors saying that there's no science behind this and the science behind it being totally fair and totally equal.

Speaker 4:          01:05:02       It's just not and people know it. Everyone knows live. They couldn't put Cris Cyborg against this guy and give him a run for his money the wrong way class or that's the other way. That's the other thing, and we're dealing with a similar situation like that in Texas. I don't know if you know about the girl who was. She was born a girl. She's transitioning to a boy in high school taking testosterone, but in Texas they only allow her to compete as a girl, so she dominated the Texas state wrestling championship two years in a row and it's horrific because she's on steroids. She's on testosterone for this kind of stuff. Doesn't matter because they're testing chromosome. She's a woman. She was born a woman, right? She's born a girl. So because the fact that she's transitioning to be a boy, they don't give a shit.

Speaker 4:          01:05:45       You're a woman. You're not going to wrestle against men. You're a girl. You're not going to wrestle, wrestle against boys. So they have allow her under extreme protests. It's terrible. She wants to compete or he, I should say, wants to compete as a boy. They won't let him. They say, no, you were born a girl. You have to compete as a girl. So when he competes everybody booze, it's off. It's fucking awful. I mean, it's, it's, it's really devastating question for you that way around. If it's female to male transition, uh, somebody that used to be a woman that transitions to a man and wants to compete with the men, they don't have an advantage. They don't know. They don't allow to disadvantage if they win in that context. They've actually done really good. Yes. Right spot. Look, women can beat men. Yeah, I mean it happens all the time.

Speaker 4:          01:06:28       At Jujitsu. There's especially in Jujitsu in particular because it's such a technique based art, but it is possible. There's. There's also a woman named Jermaine Duran to me who's a worldclass mixed martial artists whose multiple time world champion of fought a man and knocked him out. It's a crazy video. She fostered a real man. Them with a straight right. It's. It is possible for them to win if their skill level is so far superior that it overcomes the inherent strength advantages, but a woman to male transition would be at a severe disadvantage against a natural man. So would you be in that Texas case? They clearly have it wrong. They should. They should allow him to to compete with this and would you be. Whereas I can. I think all three of us probably instinctively would resist the notion that a female, a male to female athlete competes with other females because they'd have to resist that.

Speaker 4:          01:07:18       Yes. But would you be for a female to male athlete competing with men? Yes, because I don't think there's. There's no, there's no advantage, but here's the problem and the consent is sort of running the other direction. There she is continually putting herself or he's putting himself in harm's way knowingly, and I'm not opposed to a woman fighting a man if she so chooses like I'm not opposed to bull riding if you want to. I'm not lobbying to get bull riding outlawed, but if you want to be so fucking stupid that you climb on top of a 2000 pound angry animal, go for it. Yeah, maybe you should be able to do whatever you want. I think you should be able to jump out a fairly good aeros airplanes. You know, if you want to parachute, you should be able to risk your life. Parachuting.

Speaker 4:          01:07:59       The difference lies in just massive advantages and that there's a massive advantage in transitioning from male to female, female to male. Here's the other problem. Female to male. You have to take testosterone. You can't legally take testosterone and compete. It's been a giant in mixed martial arts because for the longest time there was a loophole and the loophole was testosterone therapy and they were allowing testosterone replacement therapy for male athletes that were either older or it's. It was a. It was a symptom of having pituitary gland damage, which comes from head trauma, which come, which means really essentially your career should be over, your body's not producing hormones correctly, and that's a very common issue with people that have been in war. People that have been blown up by an IED, people that had been hit a lot. Even soccer players a lot of times show a diminished levels of testosterone and growth hormone because of pituitary gland damage. So you wouldn't even allow that. So a female to male would be in a whole nother problem in combat sports because it's not legal for you to take testosterone and compete

Speaker 2:          01:09:04       right. Well, to bring this full circle back to me, sitting at the pool destroy to destroy my vacation on twitter. So how long did you spend working on this article? So again, this was. This was like, I must have hated you. How much was she mad? Well, that it was kind of the perfect storm, but there were, there were a few things that relieved the pressure. One is there was another family from our schools, so they're like, my daughter had a friend, another couple. That step that we, that my wife could socialize with and having another couple, they're forced me to sort of put on my social face at dinner and it.

Speaker 4:          01:09:39       Well, yeah, it's not cheating to look at. Yeah. The thing is, it's actually not that feeling. It's horrible, but it's not mean to say it

Speaker 2:          01:09:50       that way. He's putting on your social phase. It actually changes your psychology. I mean like if you have, if you, if you have to drop your problem in order to be a normal sane person with people you don't know all that well, you're actually a happier, more normal person. If it had just been me and my wife had dinner while I'm dealing with this blow up, I just, you know, it just never would have the cloud would, wouldn't have left. So anyway, um, I, uh, I was trying, I was trying not to engage. And so I didn't want to have to write anything new to deal with this. This is what I viewed as just an egregious attack on, on my intellectual and moral integrity. Uh, and so when I saw this article from Klein, um, I realized I had this email exchange with him at the end of which I said, listen, if you, if you continue to slander me, this is the head like a year previously because there had been released, I release this so, so I said, but I said, at the end of this exchange, if you continue to slander me, and if you misrepresent the reasons why we didn't do a podcast because we, we had had talked publicly about maybe sorting this out on a podcast a year ago.

Speaker 2:          01:10:54       But I found the exchange with him by email. So in such bad faith, I found him so evasive and dishonest. And again, just plain ideological pingpong as you said, and not actually engaging my points that I said, listen, if you, if you lie about this and you keep slandering me, I'm just going to publish his email. I think the world should see how you operate as a journalist and as an editor like he hit, he had declined to publish a far more mainstream opinion defending me and Marie and inbox. I mean he, and it was just, it was, it was truly slanderous and misleading everything he's published on this topic and he has a huge platform by which to do it. So, which I enjoy. I really like box. Yeah. No, I mean I've, I've read vox. We pleasure as well, but it is, it once you see how the sausage gets made on many of these things, but once, once your, the news item, you can see that there's very little journalistic scruple in the background there.

Speaker 2:          01:11:49       So I, um, I was mad I didn't want to have to spend my time on vacation writing a retort to this thing, but I felt like I had to respond. And again, this is an illusion. It was like a sheer confection of looking at twitter. And if I hadn't been looking at twitter I wouldn't have felt they had to respond. Um, and so I responded in the laziest possible way, which I just published the email exchange because it's already written, I don't have to write anything, you just hit send essentially. And of course the rest of the world didn't know you actually meant to be on vacation right now. And so there's no context to them as to why you were still. I, I massively underestimated the amount of work even my own fans would have to do to understand why I was so angry and that email exchange.

Speaker 2:          01:12:37       So I came off like the angry bastard in the email exchange and he came off as this just open minded ready to dialogue guy. Whereas if you follow the plot and you saw what he had published about me and Ann Marie previously, this thing that has hit is now on the hate watch page SPLC. Uh, he was being totally disingenuous and evasive and just, they didn't match to his article did they not, not at all. And so I just kept getting more tuned up and, and so I published this thing not realizing, not, you know, it was definitely a mistake to publish the email exchange. Just pragmatically not, I don't, I don't think it was unethical because I told him I was going to do it in advance if he kept kept it up. It was just a, it was totally counterproductive because it was his, he was far more reasonable people, couldn't he original article.

Speaker 2:          01:13:33       Well, it seems like you that do a lot of work to understand it. But the thing is he wasn't, it was sued. He was, it was, it was an appearance of a reason, but it was, it was not. And then we. So we finally did this podcast. I'm a year hence, you know, this is now my last podcast is now, you know, two weeks ago. And uh, you know, it was basically as bad as I was expecting a and I basic, I feel that I met the person who I thought I was dealing with in the email exchange and he was fundamentally unresponsive to any of my points. And you know, as you say, Joe, just trying to score political points to his, toward his audience. And the thing is he has. What's that mean? There's many, there are many asymmetries here, but one crucial one is that he has an audience that doesn't care about whether or not he's responsive to the thing that his, his opponent or interlocutor just said, right?

Speaker 2:          01:14:31       It's, they're not tracking it by that metric. They're tracking it by, are you making the political points that are ongoing, that are, that are massaging that you know, outraged part of our brains like our go, do you have your hands on our Amygdala, you know, and, and are you pushing the right buttons? And so he's talking about racism and white privilege and I'm granting him all of that and say, listen, let me tell you why that's not relevant to my concerns. And what happened here with Marie. I'm not gonna I'm everything you're going to say about the history of lynching. I'm going to grant you. Right? That's not the, we don't. There's no daylight between us there. And, but the thing is, I have an audience that is, that care is massively about following the logic of a conversation. If somebody makes a point that is even close to being good in response to me, my audience is like, you know, okay, Sam, what the fuck are you going to say to that? And if and if I drop that ball, I, I lose massive points. Right? Whereas I'm often finding myself in conversation with people who don't have to care about those kinds of audiences. I mean, that's, that was the one I had one with this disease, the title of the best podcasts ever. I mean, he knows his audience does not care about him, honestly. Representing, in this case, the doctor

Speaker 3:          01:15:48       who was that guy even, I mean at least Ezra Klein, he could say, okay, editor of Vox or whatever. Where did you even find that? On twitter? On twitter. That's again the twitter growth, the ruination of podcasts. Until this day, I don't even know who this bloke is, who, this guy is. Just some crazy guy. Me and Nancy. What did he call me? It was because at one point he was going on about me being some form of enabler of your bigotry and yeah, well I mean you're an uncle tom native informant or whatever it is, but I can show. I could see this is the. This is why it's so frustrating because I have pretty much memorized inside out, back to front the Islamist ideological narrative and I could sit here right now and play that game with you, that game of ping pong without conceding anything, and this is where, you know, I feel our conversation went really well because it was stripped away from all of that bullshit and we had a genuine conversation. It's still to this day very easy for me to to play the tune of the Islamist and score those points, especially because some of what I've been through school those points and just get locked in a. essentially it's ego, but it's, it's a, it's, it's not an intellectual conversation. It's a, it's, it's a game of you know, who, who is, who is basically checking the right boxes in their own little confirmation bias to their own audience and that doesn't interest me, but it's frustrating. You're also, you're also

Speaker 1:          01:17:10       the best person on the other side of that conversation now. So there's a series of videos on Youtube, I think it's called Merry Christmas, Mr. That's right. And so on youtube you can watch him pitted it against people who are playing this game, you know, Islamists and jihadists of various sorts in a. and that he, Majid is, is meeting them on your interview show is mostly in the UK where they're pretending to be more benign than they are. And that module is, you know, finding the question that sort of pulls back the mask on the theocrat and it's hilarious. It's very funny that one video that you publish on your blog. I've sent to dozens of my friends that one video where there's this guy and is addressing this enormous group of people and he's talking about is this radical Islam or Islam? That was a conference in Norway.

Speaker 1:          01:17:59       That was just, I mean, just straight up in Islamic jihadist addressing a crowd of seemingly mainstream Muslims in Norway, but he, just by, by show of hands, you know, is it, are we extremists if we think apostates should be killed, it's pretty stunning. It's an amazing document. Yeah. In respect to the way they want to treat homosexuals apostates, I mean, the whole thing is, is this Islam or is this radical Islam talking of ideology, blinkering statistical data, um, on the subject of homosexuality. So in the United Kingdom, a poll was done last year asking, so there've been two poles gauging public Muslim attitudes towards gays. Uh, the first asked how many Muslims in the UK find homosexuality is morally acceptable and zero percent. This is by the way, by professional polling companies, not just some student that's devised a poll on twitter. A professional polling company found zero percent of British Muslims responded to a poll saying that they found homosexuality morally acceptable.

Speaker 1:          01:19:01       And then a year later, which now last year, another poll a was a, was conducted. And, uh, that was a, an ICM poll asking where the British Muslims, how many British Muslims believe that homosexuality should be criminalized or remain legal. And, uh, I think it was roughly 52 percent, 52 percent if my memory serves me correctly, said of British Muslims said that they would wish for homosexuality to be criminalized. And of course, what does criminalization of homosexuality mean under shadier and a traditional Islamic jurisprudence, we know that it's punished by death. So these are these, this is scientific data from gauging know attitudes, British Muslim attitudes towards homosexuality, but the ideological blinkers will, will kick in and refuse to see that truth. And these aren't Islamists. Unfortunately, my dialogue with Sam, we talk about this, that there are the Islamists who wants to, who actively want to take over a country and enforce their version of Islam. Then there's underneath that there's a, a softer landing of very, very conservative stroke, fundamentalist attitudes that unfortunately have become widespread. And here is an example of that is that

Speaker 3:          01:20:08       is being gauged by scientific polling methodology that tells us there's a problem. And unfortunately, if one were to speak in this way, especially in Europe, one is received by my own political tribe and that's liberals center left and further, one is a met with denial and called a bigot simply for relaying these facts. A quarter of British Muslims when asked about the massacre at the Charlie Hebdo offices in Paris a quarter said that those attacks are justifiable. They sympathize with the attackers as opposed to the victims who were the staff at the Charlie Hebdo offices. So this is what led you to be put on the southern Harvard speaking in these terms. And, and unfortunately it's reporting polling data. And what it does for me is to say this is why it's so important to address these issues, to have these conversations, to try and empower those Muslim voices that are seeking to challenge this sort of, these sorts of attitudes and, and carve out a space.

Speaker 3:          01:21:09       And if, if, if, if one can do that with Catholicism in Europe and, and go through a reformation and end up with an enlightenment and end up with secularism in the West. Um, what I often say is American liberals are very happy, challenging their own Bible belt and yet we have a Koran belt within our communities and if I'm attempting to replicate the equivalent of challenging the Bible belt within Muslim communities, it means addressing these issues and yet they grant to themselves the right to challenge the Bible belt within America. And yet if we were to challenge what I call the Koran belt in Europe were suddenly called bigots. Islamophobes is this, is this static has been moving. Has it been adjusting and changing? Is there any sort of a recognition that there's an issue with this? So you know, the emergence of Isis really did bring it to the fore and it really did quiet and some of the voices.

Speaker 3:          01:22:03       It also did increase the hysteria from the far left because they began panicking thinking, actually we're going to lose this debate. And that's where I noticed their labeling became even stronger. But the emergence of Isis did wake up a lot of people to, to the challenges we're facing here. Because so many European born and raised Muslims went over to join isis. And of course, think about it in this sense, the most infamous notorious execution sell that I think were erroneously called the jihadi beetles in the press because actually it really does, it's an insult to the Beatles, but it was a diminishes the true horror of these guys, you know, they call him jihadi John and, but the isis executioners basically that entire cell of the media, face of ics execution cell were all British Muslims. And that should tell you something that we've got the worst terrorist group educator. I mean, the thing is at university graduate, like every variable that the far left wants to marshal to explain this phenomenon, like lack of educational opportunity, lack of economic opportunity, lack of social integration, mental illness. Uh, you, you can, you find people

Speaker 2:          01:23:06       who had massive opportunity. I mean, it's a bit like you were, I mean, you weren't a jihadist, but you are an Islamist. But let me, you're a person who can basically play in a game. He wanted me here. You got to get his. He's, he's, he's somebody who backed to the superman. He can run, he can run for political office. He hasn't been elected yet, but he, you know, he should be. I mean, this is the quarterback of the football team

Speaker 3:          01:23:27       in this context is a candidate for recruitment. We'll think of. Think of it this way. We've got the the worst terrorist group in our lifetime. It one can reasonably say, is Isis right though? The worst terrorist group, at least in living memory, is isis and the worst cell nrcs, the execution cell came from a fully developed, for want of a better term, first world country, and that was Britain and Mohammed. I'm was he the leader of that execution. Sell, graduated from the University of Westminster, was given as a young child was given political asylum by Britain because his family were Kuwaiti and they fled the invasion of Kuwait by Saddam Hussein, the country that the west liberated and he turned against that country. So he had every reason to like Britain. Britain gave my home, gave him a actually physically bricks and mortar house, gave his family on social costs. They gave him social housing. They educated and he graduated from university and they liberated his father's country from an aggressor. And this man turned against this country that helped him and his family and his nation. Was he captured or did he go? He's dead. One of them has been captured, but he's currently being held in Turkey. It would be fascinating to listen to his rationale.

Speaker 2:          01:24:38       Well, it's not that the other one, I forgot his name, but he was just interviewing tim. Did you don't get a lot out of him. He was interviewed by female Arab journalist. No, that was. And so on. And dismissive character. Yeah. Yeah. He, he, he refused to talk about March. He said, uh, you know, these are accu accusations and allegations you're making and I will wait to trial. In the end, he kind of cut the interview short. He seemed a little put out that she was.

Speaker 3:          01:25:05       Oh yeah, he did. So it says, I'm looking at you now. Imagine she's the interview and she's asking me questions and I'm looking at

Speaker 2:          01:25:11       direction in your direction. He literally never laid eyes on her and it was bad nlp. It's so intense and it's such, it, like, as you say, radioactive subject to it's, it's just fascinating to watch white liberal progressives just scamper away from this. But the flip, the flip side of the Isis thing has been the refugee crisis which has made, which has really empowered both extremes frankly, that the far left and the far right so you have the far right. You are obviously with the wind in their sails worrying about this influx of people from the Middle East and, and you know, and beyond North Africa, uh, and just the change of culture in their societies and a lot of these concerns are plausible, but because only

Speaker 4:          01:26:04       the far right and a few other decent people like Douglas Murray will talk about the plausible concerns. Uh, the space has just been vacated. So you just have the far right, far, far right, populous politics being enabled and then you have this delusional open borders left that won't. Uh, we talked about the problem that I told Sam about this, but it bears repeating. Um, I was having a conversation with someone as an executive at Youtube and I asked them why someone got a community guideline strike on their account because they posted up a video on their playlist that they enjoyed of Sam Harris and Douglas Murray engaged in a conversation. I'm like, I go, why would that get you a community guideline strike in? This woman said, because it's hate speech. I got a problem with the last name, Maria. Apparently Maria Douglas Murray causing me problems. Somebody worked. She was a big executive at Youtube.

Speaker 4:          01:26:57       She said, it's hate speech. And I told her, I go, did you listen to it? I go, you didn't listen to it. I go, this is stunning that you would just say it's hate speech that you just be so dismissive of it so quickly. And she talked to me as if I was her employee. Like I was not allowed to question her and she was just going to say what she said and I was going to shut up. And it was a fascinating conversation. I know this is no lie on vacation. No, but it was. I did a podcast with Douglas and apparently it got flagged. Someone else put it up on their account and I got flagged as hate speech and so strikes you can get your account removed. I've

Speaker 3:          01:27:31       got a phrase for this and I'd been. I'd been rallying for it on on social media for a couple of months now and I call it a a digital blind spot. There's a cultural bias on social media where because of, and it's intellectually lazy because because social media is essentially a California and invention, right, and we're in the home state of where most of this came from it. It's got a very Californian based worldview which cares a lot about white supremacy and doesn't care about many other forms of bigotry that exists out there in the rest of the world, which by the way is the majority of the world. So on twitter right now, of course there's A. Miley Annapolis has been banned. Tommy Robinson has been burned as in taking off now twitter is a private Tommy Robinson. He's the former leader of the British English Defense League, which was at one time Europe's largest anti Muslim street protest group.

Speaker 3:          01:28:20       I helped him leave that organization is still what many views I completely disagree with, but nevertheless he doesn't support or nor advocate for terrorism. Why was he removed? Well, so twitter, twitter is a private company. It can choose to remove whoever it wants for whatever reason, and we'll judge it for his inconsistencies. But he was ostensibly removed for hate speech, as was minor Eunapolis. Now, the point being that still till this day and before people misquote me and completely say that I'm now defending hate speech and, and it's a and their right to speak with hateful views on twitter. This is my actual point that til this day did you know that Hezbollah, which is a known and recognized terrorist organization, so forget hate speech for a moment, a terrorist organization that believes in actually killing civilians and Hamas, a known and recognized terrorist organization that believes in bombing babies on buses as a form of resistance.

Speaker 3:          01:29:15       They still have accounts on twitter. Um, and, and, and my point is, is that this is the, this is the blind spot that I've flagged twitter about this on many an occasion. This is the cultural blind spot. This is the digital blind spot that the, the dude sitting in California in wherever who is monitoring this stuff, and it's probably more than one person. They don't give a shit that there's some brown person in the Gaza Strip that believes it's okay to kill Jewish babies. They don't give a shit because it's a brown person saying it in the name of Islam. What they care about is a nonviolent yet says stupid things guy because he's white, called Tommy Robinson in England or Milo Yiannopoulos, saying stuff that they obviously that touches their sensitivities and it's so intellectually lazy to flag that immediately and to borrow it from social media because you're comfortable with it.

Speaker 3:          01:30:05       You recognize white supremacy. It doesn't take any effort to recognize it. You don't have to invest in studying this stuff to know what white supremacy is. It takes a bit of effort to study Brown peoples ideas that you're unfamiliar with and recognize. Here's a terrorist organization that's freely operating on social media. I know specifically on twitter, I've actually pulled up their handles. I think one of the concerns that twitter has, and I think this is a valid concern, is that when you have people that are saying hateful things and you have people that are saying whether it's white supremacy or whatever, even if it's stupid, the problem is there is a rallying cry of trolls that follow behind them and it builds up momentum and it gets pretty stunning and that was what was happening with Milo and by silencing Milo off twitter. They have essentially removed him from the public discourse.

Speaker 3:          01:30:53       You don't hear about him anymore because of this because of these things, but imagine what that does in Arabic with the terrorist groups. Everything you've just said, by the way I agree with and multiply that for groups that have infrastructure in multiple countries with actual organizational hierarchies and plan means of distributing, distributing their ideas across entire populations, physically fighting in wars right now such as Hezbollah and Syria, killing Sunni Muslim rebels, you know, and so imagine that and the and the way you are able to rally a mob in Pakistan on blast, for me as an example, all it takes for some personal and social media to accuse and other personal blast for me and they're probably going to get killed the very next day and it happens all the time. But, but because these Californian based social media companies are unaware of, of the, of the cultural implications of those sorts of organizations and groups and listed terrorist groups. Mind you, they are this completely. No, no barring on any of their activity. There's also the same thing that you have with youtube and with a lot of these other social media organizations and companies is they don't have to respond or give you any reasons. They can say it violates

Speaker 4:          01:32:00       our terms, but what are those terms? Those terms aren't even listed. It will be vague, like no hate speech. Okay. Well what's hate speech? Like what do you say? Like what is. What are you, what is your clear policy? What are your guidelines? How does someone avoid violating your guidelines? They don't say, and how is the president of the United States not nonviolent? Violating those demonetization is another way that they do it. They'll remove the ability to put advertising on, on, on a conversation that they don't like and it doesn't have to be like my conversation with Douglas Murray was demonic d without any explanation. None. Zero. They don't have to. Douglas is, he's talking to this kid. He's a hundred percent. Yeah, but if you listen to our act, the actual context of our conversation, there was nothing even remotely remotely hateful about it. Yeah. Yeah. I mean these are probably the companies they've got the right to, to choose what are the policy.

Speaker 4:          01:32:50       The only thing I would expect from a private company is show a consistent policy tools. These things, you know, if you don't like hate speech than Brown band Brown people who were also advocating more than just the hate speech, but actually preaching volunteerism. Right, right. Yeah. It's a strange time for this man because it's also a time where you can communicate so instantaneously. It's fantastic in that regard. You can get ideas out so quickly, but these hubs of information like where the information gets distributed are, are controlled by people that I don't think ever knew that they were going to have this sort of responsibility. I don't think. I think you're seeing that with Zuckerberg and these trials were the, the, the, the speeches that he's given in front of Congress. Like when you see him on television talking about it, you get the sense that this is a guy that never prepared for this had no idea this was going to happen, and then all of a sudden from this simple social media platform that was supposed to be friends sharing photos and just talking about girls not set up to put women.

Speaker 4:          01:33:52       There was a lot of that, you know, but I've been to, and what was twitter? I mean twitter was essentially just, you know, uh, I mean, do you remember the old days of twitter? It would be, you would use your name like is doing this, like sam, Sam Harris, like Sam Harris is at the movies. You would say that almost if you were in a third person that was the original form that people would use twitter come after that. It was weird. It was a weird way of talking and then people started just writing what they thought and it just became and then became ideology and then it became a sharing links, sharing links and interesting articles is a big part of it. But this, to me that's the only good part of it now. Like I, like I've just discovered that and that was most of my attachment to it. I mean I genuinely use it to, as a, as, as, as, as a curator of newspapers. I follow interesting people, they they tweet interesting stuff and I and I consume it that way, but noticing what's coming back at me in the Atlantis. I put something out, know a podcast and then I looked to see it's being received on

Speaker 2:          01:34:58       twitter and I don't tend to do that in other forums. I don't really look at facebook comments much. I don't look at Youtube or Youtube assessable. Right. I mean, so even if they're for you that the comments are horrible, why is that? I don't. It's been started on the youtube comment. Friends. It's spread everywhere else. It's very strange but. So I. But one thing I found that you can change your settings and twitter where you, you a screen out, people who don't have a twitter egg photos, they don't have a real photo. You can screen out people who haven't had their email confirmed and I think I just did those two things and like 90 percent of the hate went away. It was amazing. Like it just, just doing that just. It was amazing. Thank you for that. You should do that. Except I'm. I think it's better to not actually even look at what's coming back at. You would have taken it off your phone? No, I think so too. I think looking, looking at it, my wife Rachel will be very happy with that and then she should. I think she'd probably wish that I did tweak on it to. Do you read things and get angry? I'm,

Speaker 3:          01:36:04       I don't, I don't react sometimes. I like to think I don't react in this way, but I mean I can't, I can't say that because actually probably I have some times, but you know, I get all that same kind of. It's interesting because I took, I took a stance on the Syria strikes. And what was your stance? Well, I just think that um, uh, especially now in hindsight, were there no, no casualties involved at all. There were only three injuries. I think we had to take a stance that succeeded where Obama failed in, in making sure that red line was maintained, that the use of chemical weapons cannot be tolerated. Even if it was symbolic even it was highly symbolic. I think sometimes symbolism is important. So I took that stance and uh, it got a lot of love on twitter. Well, yeah, of course, because that's actually, that's against the grain.

Speaker 3:          01:36:45       A public opinion at the moment is it was against the strikes, so fully acknowledged that when I took the stance, but I argued a case and I set the case out in both on my sky news show. I have a show, I'm a cohost on the pledge and also on my radio show and LBC. I repeatedly argued for why I think is important that we don't allow for chemical weapons and they used to become militarized in our world. Um, and so it was interesting because I posted the Sky News clip of me sort of talking to camera about my reasons for this and the. And, and uh, I have this screen grab of the reaction. It's actually hilarious. It's just a puddle of blood. It is the two extremes. They actually started fighting with each other about who's right about there. So obviously, look, here's a clip, why we must intervene in Syria after that chemical that blah blah. The first one is a guy with an actual swastika Nazi symbol on his profile is, is wonderful, and it says, you know, at Nordic Scott is is handled Thomas James, he says, Magid wants Britain to intervene in Syria because Putin and acid are kicking his isis buddies office's end of story. Right? So there's the guys basically saying, but my real reason for calling for that is because I'm supporting isis against the regime. The guy immediately often responds to him and it's called [inaudible] and he says, what do you want about Nancy Demoss?

Speaker 1:          01:37:56       Magid is funded by. Your law is a far right. Uncle Tom. So they're fighting with each other. They actually, no, this is a captures that, but they're arguing with each other over whether I'm in his camp or his camp. The far right and the far left, basically you didn't have the words publicists in the world or the best one. So I should take myself out of that equation. Let them fight each other. It would be even better. Really. It, that's the move to set something like that upset the far right and the far left against each other. And you can just sneak away while they're fighting. That's how nuts it is. The twitter kind of horses, the extremes are, are um, I mean they're equally irrational and the fact that you could be at the epicenter of, of each prompt a both of their problems. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:38:43       That you're, you're a covert jihadist and you're an anti Muslim bigot. It seems like there's more conspiracy theories in terms of like what someone's actual motivation for what they're saying now than ever before to because it's so easy to express them. So someone could say, no, you know, he's far right or no, you're, you're, you're just trying to support isis like this. This is this ability to like find some nefarious reason for your actions. But again, it's reducing one's opinion to the lowest base, you know, dodgy motive as opposed to applying the principle of charity. So if joe says something now I can either sit here and actually think, no, I don't trust this guy, I don't respect him and therefore I'm going to reduce his opinion to the worst possible interpretation that he could possibly mean. And then use that against him. Or I could continue to ask what you mean by that because I'm assuming you're a good, decent human being in origin and perhaps you mean something that I haven't yet quite grasped.

Speaker 1:          01:39:36       And then I'll ask you, clarify your own opinion in your own words. And I think it's unfortunate that many of our conversations today in the far left is as guilty of it as the far right and they like to think they're not, which is part of that righteousness that blinds them from actually committing this very same injustice. They accused the far right of committing. And that is, uh, uh, it's the same bigotry in a mirror image, I call it the bigotry of low expectations. The low expectations they have that Muslims are somehow unable to adhere to common, decent liberal, secular democratic values. And so it's actually a plaguing our conversations if only we were able to strip away our ideological baggage in entering conversations and, and allow for, you know, that honest, honest conversation. But of course we say that and then you try to replicate our success in a number of occasions and found yourself incredibly frustrated while you are one more time.

Speaker 1:          01:40:25       Well, it's unfortunate. I found the one reasonable person to have a fight with. Well, it just seems like this is a side effect of this increased ability to communicate and that there's so much noise and there's so much going on. I mean, it's just the most fantastic time for the distribution of information. There's never been a time where it's so easy to distribute information in human history. It's really crazy. But I don't think we know what to do with it. And I think when you deal with people who have such rigid ideologies and they this incredibly

Speaker 4:          01:40:54       easy ability to express these ideologies, there's just so much clashing. It was just so much, so much noise and nonsense. And when someone says something that they know that they don't have to back up with facts because they know that they're there, people were on their position, will support it. You say the right keywords, you know, white privilege, whatever you want to say. And then boom, you're going to get a whole slew of people like those two people in your, your mentions battling it out with each other. You're just like kind of picking fights and starting these little fires and letting other people to

Speaker 3:          01:41:25       go to war. You know what I think we've done, and it's again, the advent of social media is that we are speaking with my friend mark about this and we've democratized truth and when you democratize truth in that way, the earlier thing you mentioned about sports, combat sports and your expertise in their field. If I had come back at you and spoke at you with as much authority as you claim in your expertise with having absolutely no history in that expertise whatsoever and assumed that I have as equal right to an unresearched claim to truth in my opinion, as you do and who has a lifetime of experience in that field. There in lies a problem that I'm aggregating to myself. This notion, this, this, this kind of belief that my opinion though, I of course have an equally legal right to express it, but it doesn't mean it carries the same weight as your opinion when it comes to combat sports and it shouldn't.

Speaker 3:          01:42:19       Unfortunately, I think what's happened with the advent and worse still you could add your expressing that opinion as a person of color as somehow therefore it's an criticizable by you because it's his truth. Otherwise you are racist and it's Mike. That's the key word that it's my truth and so the problem with that is when you relativized truth in that way, is that then I can speak to you on on an equal footing about combat sports, which only a mad person who hasn't had that history in comments. What would think would aggregate to themselves, right? To do so, but social media I think has allowed for that to happen. I gave a Ted talk in about, I think it was roughly 2011 about the dangers of this happening in social media, dividing us all, but I'd say now that if I were to pitch that Ted talk today, I did it at Ted Global.

Speaker 3:          01:43:05       If I were to pitch that Ted talk today, it wouldn't be accepted because it's not something new now. It's now people know that how social media is has divided us, but back then it was new and innovative enough as an idea for Ted global to say we want you to speak about this on and it's still up online, but if people watched it today, they think, how on earth did that become a Ted talk? Because there was this heady day back in, you know, five, six, seven years ago, this kind of hope filled moment where everyone thought Google, facebook and twitter and generally social media and also tech companies were like the good guys that these companies weren't actually companies that they were on our side against the corporate world and it turns out. I think we've just hit this moment. You mentioned Zuckerberg. We, I think we've culturally come to this moment now where think symbolized by his testimony at Congress

Speaker 4:          01:43:52       that those, that, that, that honeymoon period is over, people now view him, I think quite firmly and squarely as a ceo of a very rich company as opposed to a guy in my club that I'm friends with WHO's on my side against the world, you know, and that's how, you know, Google used to have that slogan, don't do evil jumbly they still have it. I mean the problem is the incentives are all wrong and so actually I was just at Ted and will they give you a sense of how far the rod has spread here? So I was, I found myself at a dinner sitting next to a neuroscientist who thought that this Ezra Klein thing followed me around at Ted and it's because many people have listened to the podcast and he thought Charles Murray should have been physically attacked at Middlebury. This is a neuro as a neuroscientist.

Speaker 4:          01:44:42       Academic was impeccable person. Otherwise. I mean, I think he was, after we wound up having to fight a or a dinner over it, I think he was somewhat chagrined by having expressed that opinion, but I mean, that's how, how emotionally hijacked people are by this issue and uh, but it's a, um, that's incredible. It was just. Yeah, it was the other thing that's new. This is the other thing that it's new. The left advocating for violence. This is very new. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, I always felt like the left was a nonviolent. The whole idea behind being progressive, like nonviolence was, was a genuine aspect of that. And free speech to things. Yeah. Those are two things that have been sort of stopped. That free speech is fine as long as you're not saying speech that I disagree with and nonviolence. Sure. In less we need to use violence, which is in the people that are saying it.

Speaker 4:          01:45:37       Like if you watch these anti for people like Jesus Christ, the most incompetent, violent people you've ever seen in your life. It depends. It depends. Your sensibility. Does that ever make it funny? You guys are terrible at it. There's videos of these guys practicing, there's videos of Antifa they had got together and decided to train and prepare for violence and so they're doing these martial arts classes. They have people teach them like holy shit, like at the average high school kid could fuck you guys up. Like this is the most ridiculous thing I've ever seen in my life, but it's almost like they're. They realize that there's not that much danger in what they're doing and they can kind of play with danger. They can play with violence. They can put the masks on their, you know, they're not in Israel. They're out at the Gaza Strip. Are there a bunch of counts as a guy. There's a guy who went to my old university I graduated from, so asked before I did my masters at the NSC, so as has been embroiled in a strike at the moment as the student's union has been supporting professors who were on strike and it's over the pension and pension rights in refused government refusing to raise their pension rights and whatever, and some of the students came out and strike, fall up students defending the professors and they put, they put forward a ring preventing from attending

Speaker 3:          01:46:50       their classes and, and, and a, a female black lecturer wanted to cross the strike lines to go into teach her students a white male public school educated, very, very middleclass protester far left, physically attacked her. He physically attacked a female black professor. So gone is suddenly gone. Is The white privilege gone? Is the male attacking a female? You know, gone is all of that non violence. All the above. The name of ideology he legitimized and allowed himself to attack a black female, by the way. Oh. And she was also Muslim, so she, when she went into the prep, he would've had the right Sheila. She actually said that in her interview she said, I'm a black Muslim female and this white kid is just a tip for wanting to teach my class. This is crazy. This is crazy. This is a crazy world we're in, man. This is. Do you. Are you optimistic about the future? Yeah, I say that because it's going to take a lifetime's work and I don't think that in our lifetime much is gonna Change. I think maybe for the next generation.

Speaker 2:          01:48:01       What is the picture of how do you conceive of your job at the moment and, and what, uh, what is the status quo? For instance, isis or the Islamic state is sort of fading from most people's memory now. I mean, even mine, I'm A. I'm spending much less time thinking about it because it seems to visit. So let me tell you a story

Speaker 3:          01:48:20       so I can answer this question with a story. So radical, which is my autobiography, has a US publication, right? I'm in the UK. It's random house penguin. It's published by the biggest publishing house. When I came to publishing theU , s I approached publishing houses, but it was after bin Laden was killed and so when we approached 10, 20, whatever, publishing houses the problem solve, they all said no. They said the problem solved. They said, we think, you know, we wish you'd come to us five years earlier, but problem solve now there's not a problem anymore. And uh, and a bit like what you mentioned is sort of your expertise. And, and I, I have been consumed by this subject all my life and there are a few people on this planet that I would take seriously on this subject. I'm outside especially of Quilliam. And there are other organizations, they have some really good people, but I know them all and we regularly speak.

Speaker 3:          01:49:08       So I would say it's all of these publishing houses. I can assure you 100 percent this problem not only has not been solved is going to come back around in a far west way than you can ever have imagined. This is before isis came along. None of them believe me. Of course. What then happened, my cook book eventually got published by some very small publishing house in the US and has done quite well for them, but the point of the story was this. Isis came around and people were suddenly like, oh my God, where did this come from? Of course, those of us who had been monitoring the situation knew this was going to come back around very, very heavy. Now that isis has been pushed back, and this is where this story is sort of the point of the story is we've got to resist the temptation to believe the problem has been solved because the the organization known as Isis, which isn't a bureaucracy has been fought back, but the ideology upon which that organization was built is still very much alive and it's still strong.

Speaker 3:          01:50:03       What al Qaeda did while the whole world was focused on Isis was exploited, that opportunity to rebuild and regroup and they've been a rebuilding and Syria. Now they are stronger than they have ever been, even under binladin because for the first time in the history of that organization, they are firmly embedded within the Syrian population as a genuinely kind of viewed by the people that they were fighting on behalf of as a grassroots resistance organization. Whereas before that they were seen as a terrorist group that was like a, just like a vanguard. They've embedded themselves in the Syrian population, in the Yemeni civil war. They've embedded themselves in north Africa, east Africa and in Pakistan, and they are resurgent and they are grooming Hamza bin Laden, who has been not in some and the grooming infant leadership and a time will come maybe in a couple of months, maybe in a couple of years where they announced Hamza bin Ladin as a new leader of al Qaeda currently at Simon's Zawahari.

Speaker 3:          01:50:59       When they do that, once they're grooming has been complete and assuming Hamza isn't killed, uh, up until then, all of the fragments of what remains of Isis will probably rejoin all kind of under Hamza bin Laden. And you'll have a stronger than ever before on Kaleida organization. And we've got to, we've got to remember that we never expected isis to emerge. Emergent, kind of. We'll come back with a vengeance. It. What is the, the politics between the remnants of Isis, isis and al Qaeda. Well, how has it been hard in succession to the leadership solves that problem of the. Because the isis guys were originally all kind of Isis was al Qaeda in Syria and they broke away after bin Laden died because they didn't. They had pledged allegiance to bin Ladin and the new leader of al Qaeda, Ayman Suare is by all accounts, a rather uncharismatic. And you know, he's a, he's a pediatrician.

Speaker 3:          01:51:49       He's not really a kind of bin Laden. Had the pediatrician. Yeah, he's a pro. He's Egyptian. He's an Egyptian pediatrician from a very well off Egyptian family by the way. I think his grandfather was the Egyptian ambassador to the UN pharmacists and it's been loud and clearly had the charisma, the wealth, the presence, the looks. He had all of it. That doesn't as worries, you know, competitive bin Ladin. It does. It doesn't say if the guys that broke away from all kind of centers a watery, the current leader, we pledged allegiance to be lighting, we owe you nothing. You're not our Amir, our leader. If Hamza bin Ladin comes back in as the leader of all kind of, it solves that problem because of those remnants of Isis have a loyalty to the bin Ladin Name and had been in family and they remember what they consider their glory days fighting under on the bin Laden.

Speaker 3:          01:52:39       That's not nice to hear. That's no good. No, no. The problem has not gone away. I can tell you that the problem and the problem is the ideology and it will not be dealt with until we deal with this ideology and it's why it's so dangerous to. You know, there was this awful term that I railed against. It was so frustrating to see. Under Obama's presidency, the US State Department officially adopted as their name for challenging this problem. They adopted the term al Qaeda inspired extremism. Of course it isn't. It isn't al Qaeda, that it inspired extremism. It's extremism that inspired al Qaeda and it's for the purposes of political correctness, you adopt this term and the State Department officially that we're fighting across the world. We are fighting al Qaeda inspired extremism. My former organization, his caliphate espousing organization that believes in their ideal caliphate that gays should be killed, a doctorate, she should be stoned to death. They were there before all Kinda and this ideology has been there before on cod. Okada was one of a long line of groups that came as a result of the Islamist ideology and we've got to start focusing on the ideology itself, not the physical groups that spring up from it because they can change their name.

Speaker 2:          01:53:49       As you point out, there is a another layer to the ideology that is all that is even more well subscribed, that present social and political problems. So for this one, as you said, there are conservative Muslims who don't support al Qaeda. They're not jihadists. They they can. They would honestly say bin Ladin doesn't represent my brand of Islam, but these are still people who will, who will say that homosexuals should be killed. So, so there, there's the apparent allies against extremism can still be people with so with religiously mandated social attitudes that just cannot be assimilated in cosmopolitan societies. Uh, so people who are worse, worse than worse than Al Qaeda inspired extremism. There's just this notion that on the left, and, and this was, this came out of Obama's mouth and it came out of Clinton's mouth and it's largely why she's wasn't president. Uh, it's not, it's just generic extremism, right? So that, like in the same sentence that you have to worry about the caliphate. You have to talk about, uh, abortion doctors being killed in the US once every year,

Speaker 3:          01:55:00       15 years. So you read, of course, you remember because President Obama refused to use the word Islamist extremism. Of course trump has the other problem. He thinks that like rumpelstiltskin by repeating it enough, you've solved the problem. But, but actually one of the elements in which he was correctly critical of Obama was an, I was at the time vocally critical of Obama's reluctance to use the word Islamist extremism. And we've got no problem when we talk about, you know, uh, when we talk about white supremacist ideology, we don't mean that all white people are supremacists, you know, what we were doing here is it's actually attributing precisely specifically what the ideology is and believes in white supremacy and likewise Islamist, you know, it's important. So we can that ideology, I'm still while not calling it Islam, right? So we're still giving a bit of a leeway there for everybody else, all the other Muslims, but to call it Islamic extremism, Mr.

Speaker 3:          01:55:53       recognize that it's an offshoot of Islam. It's a manifestation, extreme or otherwise obvious lamb. And thereby we are acknowledging that it's justification's are in Islamic scripture as well as of course, a multiplicity of other calls, these grievances and what have you. But we cannot ignore that. It also rests on justifications that are derived from the Islamic scripture. I mean, I can cite for the Arabic that tells you in the Koran itself to cut the hand of the thief or to lash the adulterer. Um, you know, these are all Heidi for the saying of the prophet that says, kill the person that changes their religion. This is scripture. And so of course there are other factors involved as well, but one of the factors that gives rise to this, uh, is the unreformed scripture that these extremist site. And so we have to acknowledge that Islam has a role to play. I often say that, you know, because again, under the Obama presidency, it was frustrating that the common refrain was to say that Islam, this has nothing to do with Islam. This is absurd. Is arguing that the Spanish inquisition had nothing to do with Catholicism.

Speaker 4:          01:56:51       He went even further. One point, didn't he at one point say that not only does this have nothing to do with his mom, this has less to do with Islam than any other related intimately that if it was just he bent over backwards.

Speaker 3:          01:57:01       It's nice saying the crusades have nothing to do with Christianity.

Speaker 4:          01:57:05       Gentlemen, unfortunately. Have to wrap this up. I really appreciate you guys coming on. It was a real pleasure to meet you and your book. It's the book is Islam and the future of tolerance and actually were the one thing we do have to announce is we're going to Sydney and Auckland. Yeah. Two of us and Douglas Murray and both Weinstein brothers were we're going to wreck those towns. Oh my goodness. We're going to have you doing live podcasts a day long conference generic.
