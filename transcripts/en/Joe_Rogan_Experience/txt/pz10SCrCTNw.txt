Speaker 1:          00:01          Hello Freak bitches. It's um, it all is about the, the, uh, the issues with interspecies communication. Let's pray. Dolphins, they kind of understand the concept, but they can't make the noise cause they have a blowhole. But this lady was trying, she was living with this thing for a long time and she was jerking the dolphin off and then they would, they, I still train that and lily was doing acid and try it and they cut off funding or, you know, it's like I respect that, the, the effort, but at the same time or how does she do that? Right. And however you get another dolphin, you know, maybe you just have to, you don't have to live with the golf and the game and there's gotta be a better way. I think they were of in that dolphin was the fucking happy. I can't imagine.

Speaker 1:          00:41          It was like, this is great. I'm living with a lady. I don't know if he thought it was bad. I mean, we have this big hang up about sexuality. But imagine if you had an itch on your back and you couldn't reach it and you know you were being taken care of by someone and they scratched your back before you, you're like, oh thank you. I just mean I would always lean towards like fun, put the dog that, I mean I'm, I'm more of a don't jerk and animal off kind of a guy, but I just mean there's, my point is well then maybe get a better facility to keep the Dolphin and get a couple of dolphins, let them live, put them in a, I don't know. I mean you know anytime you have an animal in captivity it's pretty fucked up. But I don't know that jerking him off is the right way to do it.

Speaker 1:          01:14          She's totally run. Would you do, which was if you had to choose an animal that jerk off, which is not a, you know, a lot of people ask me this question. I would not do it at the monkey cause if you do it wrong then bite you. I think deal with a monkey would be a little bit too much, like just doing it with a dude rough and he was like an off a monkey and they just fucking sunk their teeth of your thumb. I don't like ball exotic. I'd go like giraffe because it's tall. You could stand, you know, but they might come and kick you in the head. They might look, there's always a risk. There's always a risk. When he was checking in producer the daily show, no one said it was dyed jerking off a donkey. But I think it's a terrible way to go cause they're so cute.

Speaker 1:          02:00          Do you know the rape a lot? Yeah. Really little bears are famous for raping each other. Well, there you go. A vicious, they when they fuck they bite and really fucking get crazy. I did not know that. Yeah, you don't want to jerk off. That's what I'm saying. Don't bite you. Bite the shit. I wouldn't need to sleep on this. I'll let you guys know. Yeah, let's, uh, let's put this to a test. I mean, what she did was ridiculous but only ridiculous by our cultural standards. If you think about it like biologically, the real issue biologically is, you're right. Like you shouldn't have a dolphin and captivity like that. That's all. But in the, uh, the podcasts, they started document why they did it because it was, it's really hard to communicate with dolphins in the wild. Yeah. I did this thing in Hawaii recently where we went swimming with the dolphins. I had my four year old with me too, and she was in the water like right next to me. I literally, I was holding onto her while we were swimming and she's got the scuba mask on and shit and she's, you know, snorkeling, looking down while it's often swim underneath it. It's amazing. It's amazing. And they're wild. These are not like sea world and they'll, they'll sonar you like

Speaker 2:          03:00          it's fucking cool.

Speaker 1:          03:02          Get near you or they'll make like weird

Speaker 2:          03:04          noises and shit. I like that. The lady, every time I talked to Carter to Maya calculations, he's saying jerk me off. I've just listened to him. I mean, we don't know that for sure. Trust me. I speak to off and he wants to be jerked off.

Speaker 1:          03:18          It's like seeing that woman went jogging and Florida and she was, you know, it was like seven that night and she had a long day at work. She went right and she just dangled a feed off the bridge. I just got to dangle my feet. I'm just fucking hot and an 11 foot alligator was like, I'm going to, I'll take you now. I'll be having you now. Don't, Oh, you found it with no arms. Took her arms. Fuck yeah, that's good. Alligator was like, I know I'm an alligator and usually I don't do this cause the crocodiles do it. I'm going to do it today to you. You're going to be the only three people or four people of the year that's going to be eaten by a fucking 11 foot dragon. That'll be me. You the weird that alligators, they let them hang around because they're not too aggressive.

Speaker 1:          03:57          It's like they're just docile and he usually run from you that people don't just decide to fucking kill them on site, but really everyone in Florida should be in up in arms. They should run out to the swamps and gun those fucking dinosaurs down. Like those are a bunch of kid eating dog eating monster shit out of dogs and a guy was walking his dog and they all get it. Didn't go for the dog when for the guy just fucking Jesus. Yeah, they're just not as aggressive as crocs. If they were crocs, we would be killing them. Leftlane right. Crocodiles, they found nial crocs in the everglades. Stop it. Yes they have. There's a shoot on sight order. I fucked dial crocodile people hadn't used to have them as pets. Nile crocodiles, they don't know if they're breeding. They don't. Don't have any idea what their spot in more than one Nile crocodile in the everglades confirmed sightings.

Speaker 1:          04:44          They're saying straight up killers. Yep. You see them, they kill them onsite. Straight up come. They will come right at you. You are food as a here and there being big. Oh, they get really bad. Like that peace corps girl who was like, oh, they were in Kenya. Well, the crocodiles died out years ago. She heard, she heard, she goes swimming. The guy's like, I don't know. She's like, I'm going in with the radio. I'm a water baby. 30 seconds later I'll get to pull it on her house. Got My feet too. There was a document or an article I was reading about these people that were canoeing in the Congo and the guy behind washes, the guy in front gets taken by the crock with a Croc, just rises up out of the water and literally snatches the guy and spins the canoe upside kayak rather.

Speaker 1:          05:27          Oh the sky. And stuck in it and it like goes up and down like a bobber and then pump and then pops up. No Guy. That's it. He doesn't see the guy over again. The CROC just takes them out of the water. Yeah. And just so the model of that story is don't fucking Kayak in denial. I mean in, in the Congo, you don't do that. That would be the motto of that story. Oh fucking are you out of your fucking mind? They're not like sharks. They will bother you. They come after you come after everything. That's what they're, they're here for cleaning up. I'll just sit in Uganda. He saw, saw what a craig, I'll eat a god damn tire. Eat a whole time. It's like, I'm going to heat this tire. Oh, fucking tired. I was like, can you repeat that again? He goes, it ain't a tyro cartera cause yet eight. Oh my God. So your your food.

Speaker 3:          06:23          Yeah.
