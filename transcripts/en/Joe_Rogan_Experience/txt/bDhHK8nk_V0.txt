Speaker 1:          00:00:02       Four, three, two live. Mr Brown, how are you sir? Great. It's great to be here.

Speaker 2:          00:00:08       I have been enjoying your latest book, but I do have to tell you, I think you broke my brain with gage symmetry. I had to go over that about 30 or 40 times to try to figure out what that means and how that works and.

Speaker 1:          00:00:21       Well, it's amazing you did. It breaks our brains. I, I put it in there in spite of the fact that it's hard. That part is hard, but it is so central to the way we think about the world nowadays. So I thought I got to try and explain it and I was. I spent, I broke my own brain trying to think of ways to explain it and I figured people wouldn't devote as much time as you did to doing it is so. It's so subtle that it's that many. They'd even. Physicists have a hard time in some ways grasping the implications of it, but it is so central. The way we think about the universe. I thought if I don't include it for the inquiring mind like you then, then I feel bad. Just so baffling. It is. But you know, it's one of the things that when I write books, I write, I do most things for myself in a way and, and in every book I write, I usually learn something [inaudible] always when you're explaining stuff, you'd suddenly.

Speaker 1:          00:01:09       Most teachers say the first time they understand that anything is when they teach it and gauge them, you I'd never thought of really how to explain it. And I tried to explain to my editor, which was great because she didn't know any science and she kept not understanding yet. And, and then I came up with this explanation, involve these chess boards, which is still subtle, but I realized afterwards it was kind of neat because when I developed this explanation for gates and mature, I not only understood it in a new way, but I realized, Gee, I now understood physically. If I'd been. If I'd had this explanation before I could have predicted this higgs mechanism and all the things I only seen mathematically all come out of the picture I gave, so I loved that I was. It's a new way for me to think about the world that I didn't

Speaker 2:          00:01:48       before. Well, most of what you guys do is almost like another language to someone like myself and what would this seems to be. This gauge symmetry seems to be a very complicated word in an alien language. Yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:02:02       everything it is, but it nevertheless it. It's so central and it's. If you can picture the fact that it's fundamental to nature and they're free. If we really want to understand nature at some level, you got to grapple with it. You know, it's, we're stuck with the world the way it is. It'd be great if it wasn't, if it was a lot easier, but what?

Speaker 2:          00:02:22       Because I think that's one of the more fascinating things about it is that it's so bizarre.

Speaker 1:          00:02:25       Well, yeah. In fact, that's why it's the greatest story ever told so far because it's bizarre and the fact that it's bizarre and we've come this far is amazing. It's just amazing. We could have come this far and a few hundred years and it's kind of sad that people don't realize because they cannot stuck it. All this myth and superstition and the real world is so much more interesting.

Speaker 2:          00:02:45       It is unbelievably fascinating when you delve into the world of quantum mechanics and quantum physics and all these bizarre things that are happening far smaller than the eye can see. You really realize it is kind of magic.

Speaker 1:          00:02:59       Well, it seems like magic, but the fact that that we get it at some level is remarkable because with the other thing I find that makes it magic is when you realize that the world we experience, it's such an illusion that the real world is so different. And, and I love telling the story of how we got there because you see scientists are biased and prejudiced and have, you know, they, they know where they're going, when it's even when it's wrong and, but science can overcome those biases and prejudices and drag us kicking and screaming in the right direction and, and that's why the story is neat, but it's also lately I've been thinking in terms of politics, whites also need because we need that to cut through the crap that we're hearing about in Washington that same, the same scientific methods that have skeptical inquiry of reliance on empirical evidence of testing, of looking at many sources.

Speaker 1:          00:03:47       All those things are so essential for the working right democracy, but they're the same tools that have led us to from just beginning to understand how balls fall when you let them go, to understanding the inner workings of atoms, Nuclei and how the universe came to be and why we're here. I just find it's the story so wonderful that it's a shame. More people don't appreciate it and the best part is the so far part to me because everyday the story gets better. I'm like that other greatest story which was written by illiterate peasants 2000 years ago and never changes because it was just as boring as it is now. And this one keeps changing and we're surprised every day.

Speaker 2:          00:04:24       Well, I think one of the things that's important that you said is that scientists sometimes have ego problems and they have an idea where it's going even if the evidence disproves them, but that science corrects it. So I think that using that explanation or using that definition, it sort of defines what's important about it because human beings, even the most brilliant ones are flawed because we do have egos and we are just people. Yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:04:46       exactly. And this story that I tell, which is for me actually, it was, for me it was interesting cause I really had to learn. I thought I knew the history, but of course when you write something down you, you suddenly realize you don't. And I and I had to learn it more, and you want wanna, you want to take some of these people and shake them and say, look, the solutions right here, you got it. Why are you waiting 20 minutes, 20 years, you're looking in the wrong direction. The example I was just thinking about the other day and I was giving a talk. I don't know if you ever saw this video where you're supposed to look at these people bouncing basketballs and and you're and you're supposed to, I'm going to ruin it for you and all your listeners if they haven't a show where you're, where you're supposed to count the basketballs and see many people are and there's a guy walking between them and an ape suit and a gorilla suit and you never see them, right?

Speaker 1:          00:05:28       You don't even see them because you're so focused on the wrong thing. And that's the way physics often happens. We're focused on. We think the direction is one direction. We're so focused on it. We don't even realize the solution is there before our very eyes. And I think it's important because you know, people think that science, you know, is that scientists and science are the same thing and they're not scientists or ones. The good thing about scientists that's the good scientist is they're at least willing to recognize in the end that they're wrong. So they have these preconceptions. And the great thing about sciences that trains us, yeah, there's these things, we are central to our being, but ultimately we realized we're wrong and were willing to change our minds. That's the difference between science and religion really. Is that. Yeah, we have biases. Yeah. We have prejudice.

Speaker 1:          00:06:10       Yeah. We want to believe we really want to believe just like the x files, but eventually when nature tells us otherwise, we throw out those beliefs like yesterday's newspaper. That's why science is so neat now. People that are listening to this and probably going, what is gauged cemetery? Dude, you just passed over that and you said it was crazy. Okay. Is there a way that you could possibly just. Well, I'll give a try. We'll see how we do. Okay. So. So it turns out that that there's a fundamental principle in nature, which, which really was discovered by this wonderful woman mathematician, I mean your author who was, who wasn't even allowed to get a job if she would, because she was a woman and the at the turn of the century, but she discovered so there's things we say and we tell kids, unfortunately schools, energy is conserved and momentum is because driven.

Speaker 1:          00:06:57       It sounds like the 10 commandments like we come up with them because we liked them and now we understand them differently. We understand that everything that is conservative doesn't change in the world, is due to a fundamental symmetry of nature. So energy is conserved because we now understand the laws of physics don't change over time. So as long as you it contest that the laws of physics are two same tomorrow as they are today, than we know energy is concerned. It's not something we take on faith. It's a mathematical consequence of that momentum. Conservation is a consequence of the fact that the laws of physics don't change from place to place that they're saying in this studio here as they would be if we're having this conversation in New York that seems reasonable, and she showed mathematically it's the case, so there's a. there's a famous, everyone's experienced this who knows, learned any physics, conservation of charge, you know the electric charge and any system doesn't change magically overtime.

Speaker 1:          00:07:53       That's a fundamental property of electricity and magnetism. You got certain amount of charge at the beginning. It's got to be the same at the end. That's a consequence of the fact that it's arbitrary. There's a symmetry of nature that says, you know Benjamin Franklin called electrons negative, negatively charged, but it doesn't mean anything because I could have called them positively charged. It's just an arbitrary definition. If I changed every negative charge and the world to positive charge and every positive charge and negative charge, everything would work the same way. A symmetry of nature represents something. It doesn't change about nature. When you make a change in the definition, so making every calling, electrons positively charged, protons negatively charged would not make the world difference. It's an arbitrary name. Martians could call electrons, positively charged and protons. The negatively charged is nothing fundamentally important about the word positive charge.

Speaker 1:          00:08:47       It doesn't mean any different than a negative charge. So I could change every right now I could make all neck, I could change the charge on every electron, the universe and flip it is signed. So every electron is negative. Lead charged now, but now suddenly I'm God and I make every electron positively charged and every make, every proton negatively charged. Nothing about the laws of physics will change. I don't understand that. Why would, why wouldn't it change? I mean, does. Is there a function of them being positive and negatively charged? No, it's just a name. That's why it's so that I can call down and down up and it wouldn't make any noise you make with your mouth. Yeah, exactly. So the name I give it is irrelevant. Okay. So it's not like you would change the actual function of the electronic. No, no, exactly.

Speaker 1:          00:09:29       I call it's, it's electrically charged. That's important. Okay. And it repels other, other electrons because they have the same electric charge that's important. Right? To electrically negative. Charged particles repel. Right. But look, if I made the both to positive charged particles, they'd also repel so, so the. So the physical consequences would not change at all depending upon how I named them. I see. Okay. Now, so the example I used in the book to try and they sort of described that is a chess board. You Got White squares and black squares and you and you know, you played with the white chessman of the Webinar. If I changed all the white squares into black squares and I rotated the board by 90 degrees it would look identical. And if I changed the black players, white players and white players, the black players, the game of chess would be identical.

Speaker 1:          00:10:16       Nothing would change about it. So what's white and what's black is kind of arbitrary, right? It doesn't matter. Which is good because it kind of wasn't than chess wouldn't be a fun game because if you always had black you might win. If you always had white, you might win, but it's, it's the same, right? Right. So, so I could change all white squares to black squares and black squares, two white squares and the game of chess would not change. So that's a symmetry of the chessboard and that's like, that's like electric charge, white being negative or positive and black being, you know, let's say I say white is negative and black is positive. If I switched all black to white or negative positive, nothing would change about the game of chess. If I switch negative to positive in the universe, nothing changes in the universe. The game of life, the game of physics would not change. The rules wouldn't change. The dynamics. Everything would remain the same about the universe. So that you could sort of see even that is not so easy. I can tell from looking at your face, it's already not so easy. Okay, but, but you couldn't sort of accept that. Yes. Okay. Okay. That's the easy part.

Speaker 1:          00:11:20       Okay, so here's what gates symmetry says, man, this is really weird. I can actually do better than that. I can arbitrarily change each white squares on a chess board to a black square. I can choose randomly which white scares to change the black squares and I can still make the game of chess the same if I just have a rule book and the robot tells me, Oh, if you're on that square, you can do what you could have done if it was a white square. So if I have the rule book, then it doesn't matter what color is the squares are. If I know I was in the square that used to be white, but I call it black and I look at and say, okay, my my night can do this and that square, but it couldn't do that. So if I have a rule book, then what?

Speaker 1:          00:12:01       Then I've arbitrarily free to change the color of each square on a chess board. As long as a rule book tells me what I've done, right. That's, that's electromagnetism because it turns out electromagnetism as a symmetry that says, you know what, I could change the definition of the charge on electron here, but in the next room differently. So I could call this electron positive and one negative and it wouldn't change anything as long as they had a rule book that told me that I made that change. And how and how the electromagnetic interaction would be the same as long as I, I, I'm free to change the definition of what I call positive and negative charge locally, not globally. That means I can do it differently here and there as long as I have a rule book that says, you know what, that electron used to be negative.

Speaker 1:          00:12:46       So it'll still repel this electron here, even though I call it positive and I call that negative. I've changed locally the definition, but I also changed the rules. I understand that. Okay, now the need for the rule book. Now it turns out that the rule book really tells you it's a rule at each point in space, right? It's a rule tells you what you can and can't do at each point in space. So we call that a function because the function is a number or a rule at each point in space. A function at space is, uh, is, is exactly that. Well, it turns out the function that does that is the electromagnetic field. If you ask what would be the mathematical characteristics of a quantity that would make sure the rules remain the same no matter what I called an electronic place to place and you asked how I could write it down mathematically, it would have exactly the mathematical form of the electromagnetic field, the thing that that we call the electric field or magnetic field.

Speaker 1:          00:13:40       The mathematics of it is precisely fixed by being able to allow us to change the definition of charge from place to place in a way that doesn't change the ultimate dynamics doesn't change the way the world works. It's prescribed by the mathematics of the rule book is prescribed and the mathematics of that rule book turns out magically almost to be exactly the mathematics of Maxwell's equations, which are the equations of electromagnetism. Here's where it gets squirrely from it. Why would you do that? Why would you change the definitions? Why would you need that rule book? Well, because I mean what it says is that nature somehow as the symmetry, it doesn't depend what will you don't want to, but it says nature. Nature has designed itself such that the definition of electric charge from place to place is arbitrary. It really came. If you want to step back, Einstein told us, you know that length and time are kind of relative to be. They depend upon the observer and his theory of general relativity actually said, I can define locally what my coordinate system is, what my length is, what my time is. I can define that arbitrarily locally

Speaker 3:          00:14:52       and it may differ from place to place. My rulers could differ from place to place but the war, but the universe doesn't care because there's this thing called the gravitational field that takes into account of that and nature has that cemetery. So it doesn't matter if I change the rule book, if I change the what I define as space and time locally, the universe behaves exactly the same. So when you say by symmetry, do you mean essentially there's a balance that there's always going to be an equal numbers of negatives and positives and that's changed. That's the functions of each one. Well, it balances itself out as well. That's sort of a consequence. It says

Speaker 1:          00:15:24       universe can't be charged and ultimately. But no, it really says that that's. That's a quality of nature, that nature doesn't care about law. Namely you. That's a. that's a label, but nature has a symmetry in physics. Symmetries are things when you make changes, they don't. Then the object doesn't change. Take a sphere. Okay, that's fair. You can rotate it, but it looks like a sphere. No matter what rotation you make, right? That's a symmetry of the sphere. That's why it's so beautiful in mathematically is the same way. I can take another quantity, I'll call it electric charge at this point and I can change it if you want to say, make a rotation and some internal space and I can imagine an internal space of positive and negative charges were part of some continuum. I make a rotation and nature doesn't care about it. It's a symmetry of the equations that govern nature, but it turns out the reason this is important.

Speaker 1:          00:16:20       Let me step back again because your face tells it all. I wish people could see it. They can. Yeah. Yeah. And, and, and um, so what we've discovered is that the playing field determines the rules. The characteristics of the playing field's determine the roles. If baseball, if you played baseball and there were five bases instead of for the rules will be different. If the distance between home plate and first base was a mile, the rules would be different. If you had 25 out of feelers out in Outfield, it would be different. Okay. So the playing field determines the rules, right? You can't. Baseball will be very different game if we played on a field that's different. What we've discovered in nature as we used to think the forces were kind of fundamental, you know, Newton told us that goes man and all that. What we discovered is the thing that really constrains what can happen in the world is the playing field and the characteristics of the playing field.

Speaker 1:          00:17:18       And for physicists, what determines the characteristics of the playing field are the symmetries of that playing field. In fact, baseball, the fact that it looks like a diamond is a is a symmetry, right? I can. The thing feel looks the same. I could call first base, home plate and home played first base if I rotated the whole field, right? It determines in some sense that's the. That's a characteristic of baseball that sort of determines the rules of the game. Okay. And what we've learned is what's really fundamental in nature is the of that playing field and what determines the characteristics that playing fields are the symmetries of nature, the things that that demonstrate to us that what we think is fundamental is really just an arbitrary label like electric charge isn't we've discovered is an arbitrary label locally as well as globally, and that determines the whole nature of the forces that can happen.

Speaker 1:          00:18:11       Once you say the electric charge is an arbitrary thing in nature, doesn't care what you call positive and negative from here or Mars. That determines the nature of the force of what we call the electromagnetic force. It's completely prescribed and it turns out that's true for all the forces of nature. The nature of gravity is determined as Einstein showed by the fact that you can change what I define as one meter here and on Mars called one meter or something else and nature doesn't care what I label as a meter. It turns out gravity takes that into account and says what we define as length is irrelevant. The fundamental gravitational field is due to a curvature of space that that is independent of what we define as length or time locally. It's a weird thing, but it's a property of space and time that Einstein discovered for general relativity.

Speaker 1:          00:19:04       We've discovered it for electromagnetism. It turns out all the forces of nature respect that same kind of same kind of mathematical symmetry, that there's some quantity that you can change in your equations. I can change its definition and the equations, but the physics remains the same and the nature of the equations this is prescribed. The mathematical form of the prescribe equations is prescribed precisely by the requirement that I can change. In the case of electric charge. That electric charge is arbitrary, I can call an electron positive or negative anywhere I want in space, and the equations don't care. That prescribes the fourth formula equations. They have to have a very particular form, a unique form, and that unique for them happens to be the form that it has now, so you can say, look, it's an accident that really there's something fundamental that the equations have this form in low and we've discovered this mathematical symmetry is an accident or you can say that the mathematical symmetry is fundamental. It's a property of nature and it prescribes the form of the kind of forces that nature that the world. Laos.

Speaker 2:          00:20:12       When you say that the, the, that it's fundamental that the dissymmetry is fundamental. Do you see this image? Do you study like ecosystems? Do you study? Like I know about them but I'm an but do you ever contemplate them? When you thinking about theoretical physics and when you, do you ever look at like how these animals sort of stay in balance in these ecosystems when they're untouched? Well, I mean the mathematics of. I mean that's the great thing about physics. About Science in general, it's kind of like Hollywood, if it works, you copy it

Speaker 1:          00:20:39       and and so we often find the same mathematical formalism plight, a vastly different systems, so there's a famous set of equations of Predator and prey for ecosystems and and, and you can look at those equations and they're the same kind of equations that apply in many different systems and in, in, in oatmeal boiling and also it's amazing how the same mathematics appears and very different systems and we can therefore use what we've learned in one case to apply to another. That's why we copy it because it works so broadly. It's amazing that very few equations turn out to so broadly described so many vastly different systems and Predator prey relationships, which is I think what you're talking about in ecosystems, how you know there's a in an evening with plants as well. I mean, I mean, I mean like the full system. Yeah. Once you.

Speaker 1:          00:21:26       And it becomes more complicated when you include more variables, but physics of course is generally much easier than many ecosystems. That's why I do physics. It's so much easier. It's because it's really the low hanging fruit nature and it's fun for you. Well, I know, but, but, but for most people listening to this is probably 100 people that have driven into trees by now. Like what the fuck is this guy talking about? I'm glad there's people like you out there that are. They can feel good that the laws of physics are independent of whether they've run into the tree. So feel good. I'm sure that gives them great comfort. Yeah, exactly. It's just the study of this is so it's so taxing. It is, but you know, that's okay. I mean, sure. What, what, what sort of bothers me is that people when they think it might be, might be taxing.

Speaker 1:          00:22:15       They don't want to think about it, but the interesting thing is that doesn't apply in other areas of actually so people can be. They don't think they have to be or Clapton to enjoy guitar music or pub or Picasso to enjoy where paintings or, or Shakespeare to enjoy place, but somehow and all of that, that's taxing in its own way. Okay. And the more you want. Let's, let's take Bach. The more you understand music, I'm sure the more you appreciate box, Bach Cantatas, all the different voices, but I can enjoy just listening to it, right? And, and, but people say in every other activity it's fine, but when it comes to science they say, Nah, it's not easy for me. I can't even touch it at all and what I try and do in my books and a place to say, look, there's things you don't have to master it, but, and, and so you may not know.

Speaker 1:          00:22:59       Master gave some of the most subtle and complicated thing in all of modern physics, but you can still, even if you skip that section of the book, there are still things in there. You can appreciate it. But how we understand the world that we couldn't appreciate before and have that orgasmic Aha experience that hey, the world is different than I thought and that's, that's what's wonderful. So you can appreciate science without mastering. It's sure it gates, symmetry and things like that are basically mathematical concepts. So to talk about them in language without math is always sort of verbose. Well, I think what's important about your book, I'm in chapter 10 or 11, I think. I think what's, what's really important about it is not, you're not speaking in layman's, but you're also

Speaker 2:          00:23:46       not speaking in theoretical physicist terms. You're making a bridge.

Speaker 1:          00:23:51       Well, yeah. And, and someone, I think Richard, a few people said nicely said about the book that as they say, they claimed as long would said, I'm trying to make it simple but not simpler than it can be. Yes. And I think the right way saying, well, but I think it's important to do that, right? I mean as it respects the reader, because it doesn't, you know, it, it, it says, look, you want to understand it, okay, here's, here's, here's what you need to know it, understand it and here's how I can try and explain it without math. And you can puzzle through it and think about it and eventually maybe get to that Aha stage. But, or I could just say, you know, poof, it all happened, you know, and then that's religion in a way. But except the differences. This as content religion doesn't

Speaker 2:          00:24:32       for people like me that have never studied it. When I read what you're doing in a read what's been done and I read all of the people out there that are trying to decipher all this magical stuff out there in the universe. It's, it's, it's important to just to be aware that this is going on because I think for the vast majority of the 7 billion people on the planet, this is just unknown exactly, but it said it's being. It's being discovered, it's being contemplated, it's being studied

Speaker 1:          00:25:00       and it's not just that it's being done, but it's amazing. It has changed our picture of our place in the universe and therefore I think science is like art and music and literature. It's they all serve the same purpose. Science also produces technology and somehow people think that's all. Science is good for sure. It produces the technology that's making, allowing you and I'd have this conversation and people to listen as long as you and I live longer, all of the rest, but the really neat thing about science is it is just like those other things. It changes our perspective of ourselves and, and that's what's so wonderful that I once said that science is sort of one of the purposes is to make people uncomfortable. And I thought I felt regretted that for a while, but it really isn't. If you're never outside your comfort zone, then you're never, you're never growing. I completely agree. And I love that quote in the book.

Speaker 2:          00:25:47       Um, I think that for, for a lot of people that discomfort is just people are tired, you know, they work the jobs, they've got families, they've got a lot of stuff to do and something like this comes along that just like throws a monkey wrench into the gears of the mind.

Speaker 1:          00:26:01       Yeah, it does. But sometimes you want your mind blown and sometimes you know, you can skim over or I try with him books and say, okay, so that part you can get, but, but you know, it's not like suddenly you won't understand the rest of the book. And the stuff is so neat. The idea that there's this invisible field everywhere in the universe that changes the way you haven't got there, the book yet. But, but that changes our picture of the universe is amazing and people should have the opportunity to know that our picture is shown that we are a cosmic accident that were just like an icicle on a window, that whose direction if you lived on that icicle might seem very special to you, but as an accident and it turns out the forces nature are what they are by the same kind of accident because some field froze in the early universe in some direction.

Speaker 1:          00:26:49       If it had frozen in another direction, you and I wouldn't be having this conversation. That's what we would we be a different thing. In fact, in most cases you wouldn't even have you and me because there wouldn't be particles that have mass and you wouldn't have stars and galaxies and planets. Now what? There would be, I can't say, but I can definitely say that everything we see in the universe would be gone. But you're confident that it was an accident at some point in time and what I've created. What I mean by accident. No more of an accident or less of an accident than an icicle. On a window now, if you look at icicles on a window with they're beautiful patterns, they're in all different directions now. There's a physical reason ultimately why one icicle forms in a, in a given direction, but there's no significance to that.

Speaker 1:          00:27:30       It may have been a dust particle that caused that part that we're not saying it's magic. There was ultimately some micro physical reason why that happened and why oatmeal we'll boils a bubble up occurs in one place and not another, but, but there's nothing significant about that bubble popping up here or that icicle pointing in a given direction. It's not fate and not fate. It's not designed right it anything is possible in that icicle. Okay, and so what, what I'm saying is our universe is the way it is because of field frozen a certain direction. Now it's true. There are laws of physics. Say the field Kent can freeze in that direction, but it's also laws of physics. Say the field could have frozen maybe in another direction, and if it did, everything would be different. Now what my field would, how are you defining where the field is?

Speaker 1:          00:28:12       A Oh, you had you gotta take him. Yeah. No, no, no. I was worried about the field is. Well, it's like the electric field. Okay. Some quantity that's defined in each point in space. And, and the neat thing in particle physics is every field, like an electric field, every field is associated with an elementary particle. So the electric field is produced by a coherent state of photons, the ultimate Quanta of electromagnetism, the, the, the individual particles that are, that are being, that are going into your eye right now and are being absorbed by your eyes. So you can see me. The reason you can see light is it's a lot of little particles entering your eye that had been that, that are reflecting off my eyes so you can see them. Okay? And it turns out in quantum mechanics, every field, which is a point which is a function of points in space.

Speaker 1:          00:29:02       The electric field in this room, there are, there's a magnetic field in this room because we're in the here in the. In the earth has a magnetic field, right? If they put a compass here, will feel the magnetic field that's actually. There's this coherent state of photons that are basically very regular in space. That's really what a field is, and quantum physics, a very regular configuration of elementary particles that are sort of hidden in space and it turns out there's this background fields we call the higgs field, which is everywhere in space and happens to have a very particular configuration and then when the particles that make your body and my body up, when we moved through it, they experienced a resistance that causes them to behave as if they have mass. If the field wasn't there, the particles will be massless. It's like swimming in molasses.

Speaker 1:          00:29:47       It's, you know, if you're swimming in water, you feel pretty light, but if I've filled the pool up with molasses and you tried to do 100 meters, you'd be pretty damn tired. At the end of it, you'd feel like you're weigh thousands of pounds. We're swimming through molasses. We just don't see it. It's amazing. It's there. I mean, it sounds like, as I was just saying to a group earlier today, it sounds like religion, right? I think there's an invisible field everywhere that's responsible for our existence. That sounds like religion, except for the fact in physics we can say that's not good enough. If it's there, we got to find it and if it's there, what do we do? If that field is associated with particles? If I, as I as I like to say, it's cosmic sadomasochism. If I spank the vacuum, if I dumped enough energy and empty space at a single point, I should kick out real particles.

Speaker 1:          00:30:33       If that field is there, if the higgs field is there, if I dump enough energy and empty space, I'll kick out real particles. I'll call them Hicks particles, and you know what? Let me build a big machine in Geneva, the biggest and most complicated machine humans have ever built, call it the large Hadron collider that dumps enough energy into a point in space that can maybe kick out higgs particles of the really there and you know what? They're there. On July Fourth, 2012, we announced the discovery of 50 particles that looked and sounded and walked and quack like Higgs is, and we now have tested them much more produced many more and they're they're higgs particle. They gives us evidence that that field exists. It was an outrageous and audacious claim that the properties of the universe we see are an accident due to this background field that's there, and if that background field wasn't there, the world would look very different.

Speaker 1:          00:31:24       It's an amazing claim, but is it a consequence of this field or an accident? Well, the properties of the universe we experienced are consequences that field, but that field being there is as much an accident as an icicle freezing on a window in a certain direction. The field could have frozen with a different value. It could have frozen with a different magnitude or if that's where I'm gone. Well not just that. It's very difficult for me to understand why you can determine in one way or another, the field here. Here. Let me give you an example that I try and use. In fact, it just got a version of it just got. When I went online, I used a beer bottle as an example. You may have drunk beer once or twice in your life. I have. Okay, good. I don't know if you've ever had a party.

Speaker 1:          00:32:04       I have. And you forgot to put the beer in the fridge. So have done. Put it in the freezer. Okay. So. And then what happens? You forget that it's in the freezer and then. And then the next morning you discovered in the freezer explodes. Explodes. Got It. Why? Because really the, the, the beer would rather be frozen, but when it's under pressure in the bottle it's liquid. Okay. But for example, if you open the top, so the pressure is released and it's suddenly freezes. Okay. The beer has changed from one state to another. It's gone from liquid to solid. When it's gone to solid, it's suddenly releases a lot of energy. Okay. If you wish, you could think of the, uh, of the properties of that beer as a field. It can either be liquid or solid. Okay. And it changes depending upon the temperature and the pressure and all the rest, it turns out the state of the universe changes as the universe cools.

Speaker 1:          00:32:57       And you can think of that. Higgs is like the, as like a sort of a cosmic fluid that's everywhere. And as a universe cooled down, suddenly it found would rather be in a certain configuration. It would rather be frozen in liquid. Okay. And at some numbers that tell you whether it's acting like it's frozen or liquid, just like I could describe the beer and I could define some numbers that would tell me whether the beer was frozen or liquid. And so as the universe cooled, that cosmic fluid, which is everywhere, all these elementary particles, if you wish, that are permeating space suddenly found themselves preferring as the universe cool down to be in a certain configuration rather than another configuration. Okay. Then it really is no different than the arbitrary state of an icicle know exactly. It's just essentially as arbitrary. It's not magic and it's not as if you know, if we in some sense the accidents of what the dust that's on your window and the wind that's blowing and everything else is going to determine what that, what that pattern looks like, but every day if you had a new cold day, the icicle pattern would look different.

Speaker 1:          00:34:01       Okay. It's not as if every day you'd have the same icicle pattern on your window. It would be different and that's what I mean by an accident. It's not as if the laws of physics at some level of couldn't have told you that if you knew all the configurations on that day why would look one way or another, but it's not significant. I guess what I mean, there's no special significance to that pattern that meant God meant it to be and there's no special significance to the universe in which we live. That meant God meant it to be. It could have been quite different. We should celebrate that. It's not quite different because you and I can have this conversation, so it's a wonderful thing that it is the way it is and let's celebrate that. We're that we've evolved and I can still say that word in this country.

Speaker 1:          00:34:42       We've evolved a consciousness so that we can appreciate all of the wonders of the universe. Let's celebrate that so it doesn't mean we're meaningless just because the universe has no purpose. We make our own purpose in our own life. It means to me in some sense that life is more purposeful. There isn't someone pulling the strings were pulling the strings, and so it's okay to live in a purposeless universe. It doesn't make life worse. It makes it much better. We just always ascribed significance to things that happened to us. The physicist Richard Feynman used to, used to go up to people and he used to say, you won't believe what happened to me today. You won't believe, and people say, why do you say absolutely nothing? Okay? Because when things happen to you, suddenly they're significant. You know what? You have a million crazy dreams and then one night you dream that your friend is going to break their arm.

Speaker 1:          00:35:30       The next day they break their leg. You Go, Oh my God, I'm clairvoyant. You know? Or he'll say that. He'll say, you know, I just saw a license plate. I, you wouldn't believe I just saw a license plate. It wasj two, four, seven, nine, six. Can you believe it? Because you know, that's a significant, a single license plate that says one one, one, one, one, one, one or, or a license plate that says, I am God. Okay? They're all just as significant. But the things that appear to mean something to us suddenly take on some significance because we're hardwired to want to believe. Just like the x file said, we want to believe. We all want to believe we are. We're hard. But well, here's the reason we want to ascribe, ascribe meaning to everything. And I think there's an evolutionary reason for that. For example, if you're a, uh, an early modern human on the Savanna in Africa, the leaves can be rustling in the trees next to you.

Speaker 1:          00:36:26       You can say, ah, no reason, or he can say maybe there's a lion there and what happened was, so maybe there's a line causing maybe there's a cause for that happening now that those of our potential ancestors that said isn't a reason they got eaten, the ones that didn't are the ones that we produced. Right? Right. And so in some sense we're kind of hard wired by evolution to want to find purpose and meaning and everything, but isn't that just recognizing danger or potential danger? Of course it is in that case, but, but, but, but have side effect of anticipating danger is to ascribe significance to things that may not. You're much luckier if you're much luckier, but you're much more likely to survive if you ascribed significance to everything. Perhaps in the early days then if he was grabbing significance to nothing. But when you say, when you're talking about significance, essentially you're talking about divine significance about it can be divine significance, but it can just be.

Speaker 1:          00:37:28       You can think there's more more to it than meets the eye. Right? But when you're talking about clairvoyance or when you talk about some sort of a divine intervention by a deity, you're talking about something powerful. This is the one that is meant to be the leader of this tribe, but that's the consequence, right? Yeah, but it works at all levels. It works at all levels, from the fact that the leaves are rustling and it means that line. But once we have that hard wired thing, then we want to be then our, our, our desire to believe continues and, and, and social beings may be found that if they imposed some meaning on the universe, on a universe which otherwise is hostile and dangerous, that maybe it might help bind them in tribes that maybe would help Mike make them happier about being alive early on because they might be so scared of a universe that wants to kill them all the time that it would bolden them.

Speaker 1:          00:38:17       So there's obviously an evolutionary purpose to, to what is religion, because if there wasn't, religions wouldn't be everywhere. Right? I mean pretty well. All human cultures have religions. Each one is inconsistent with every other one. But which was the reason we know that they're probably all wrong, but, but it works the that it's universal, must mean there's some evolutionary utility to the believing, but then certain things eventually, even though they worked and were useful early on, as our human condition changes, they may not be so useful. Well, that seems to be the place where we're at now as a civilization. Exactly. I, I would argue that religion is turning out to be counterproductive. Now it may have been useful early on in human history, but now what it's doing is it's getting in the way, not only of progress, but have a few in cooperation and so evolution is now is now counterproductive.

Speaker 1:          00:39:11       But the great thing is we have, we have a consciousness. We have an intellect, so we can actually overcome that evolutionary predilection by realizing we have that predilection and as as firemen said, that the easiest person to fool is yourself. So if you're a scientist, what you have to do is ask yourself, am I believing that? Because I want to believer because there's evidence. So if we constantly are, are skeptical of ourselves, we can know to overcome that ingrained impulse, we have to want to believe that's one of the utilities of science. So I may listen to you and like you and I may listen to another radio person and not like them and I may be therefore naturally willing to assume that they're wrong and you're right. But I should also say to myself, is it really the case or is it just because I like Joe Rogan and I don't like, you know, you pick your favorite right wing nut, right?

Speaker 1:          00:40:02       And, and, and so we should be asking ourselves, okay, maybe I should go beyond my predilections, me on my biases to ask why I am sympathetic to what I'm hearing. And if we did that in everyday life, I think we cut through the crap more carefully. So science says, look, we are hardwired to want to have these weird beliefs and it's fine. Maybe some of them are right, but the only way to know is to test them. If we're not willing to contest our beliefs and subject them to that, the test of nature, then then we're going to be diluted and that's the problem with that with a lot of what's happening in our government. People saying, you know what, I really want to believe in this absurd story and therefore I refuse to accept evolution. If you're the. If you're Mike Pence, the vice president, the country, you say, I don't believe evolution because I don't.

Speaker 1:          00:40:50       It doesn't agree with my ridiculous fundamentalist ideas. And he said that in Congress, right? He said, we shouldn't be teaching evolution in schools. We should be teaching intelligent design and and why? Because he, he, it, it offends his personal faith. Perhaps it might also be a political ploy. It might be a thing because he knows that a large percentage of the country finds comfort in a leader that subscribes to the same sort of superstitions that they do. Yeah, I, I, that could be a. He did this before. He was in a national office. He was a congressman. I suspect he did it. It sounds like he believed it, but you're right. Who knows, right, but at, but the point is that we, we, we should realize that the only that, that we shouldn't listen to that kind of nonsense because we may not want, because there are a lot of people in this country who do think that evolution directly confronts their belief in God or the Big Bang directly confronts their belief in God and therefore they don't want their children to learn about that.

Speaker 1:          00:41:47       But what an awful thing to do to your children to withhold evidence about how the world really works because you know you don't have to believe in the big bang, but it really happened. You don't have to believe in evolution, but it happened. It's like Philip K, Dick said, the science fiction writer reality is that which continues to exist. Whether or not you believe in it, okay, and so you may not want to believe in it, but it happened. And, and for you to withhold that kind of knowledge from your kids because you're worried it's gonna Affect. Their faith is, in my opinion, child abuse because you're hindering their capabilities as an adult in a society which is highly technological to function effectively. They're doing it because they believe in as well and they need. It's right. I'm not believing they think they're helping their kids, but most of it, I don't know if you're a parent.

Speaker 1:          00:42:32       I am. We've all screwed up our kids, right? We all do things for our kids because we think it's good for them and sometimes it is and sometimes it isn't. I'm not saying these people are doing it because they. They want to hurt their children. They think somehow that not believing in God makes you a bad person. Right? But there's no evidence of that. In fact, in fact, Steve Weinberg, who was a Nobel prize winning physicist has said, and I love it, he, he, he said, so they're good people in the world. They're bad people. Good people do good things, bad people do bad things. When good people do bad things, it's religion. Do you think that religion in its earliest stages was in a sense primitive man with no science trying to figure out the world and trying to have some sort of rules like almost like a scaffolding in order to to move to the next?

Speaker 1:          00:43:21       If you see that it exists in so many different cultures, it might have been something along the course that way. Was there effort. It was their effort to understand the world around them based on what they knew it was noble. You know, they tried to understand the world and so there's nothing wrong with it, but claiming that we today should be guided by the worldview of of illiterate peasants in the Iron Age. Peasants who who didn't know the earth orbiting the sun and wrote down scriptures based on their beliefs at the time they argue that that should guide our life. Today when we discovered 100 billion galaxies in the universe and discovered all this stuff is ludicrous. So you're absolutely the birth of science and religion are the same and in fact, modern science grew out of religion. People point that out and they send to me, how dare you talk about religion, you know, as, as being outdated.

Speaker 1:          00:44:07       Science grew out of religion and I say to them, well that's fine, but children outgrow their parents, right? So great. No doubt. Religious ideas and all our early scientists were religious because it was the only game in town you couldn't be educated except the church controlled all the universities and so it was like the National Science Foundation of the 16th century. It's not surprising they were all religious because that's that the only game in town so that, that ca helped create the birth of modern science. But science outgrew it and that's okay. Kids outgrow their parents. Thank goodness. Well, I think maybe that might help kids outgrow their parents. Why the getting religion forced down your throat is one of the best ways for kids to, for suggested as they get older. Son, for some kids, kids like you and me. But I get lots of letters. You know, we made this movie called the unbelievers and and which followed Richard Dawkins and I around the world as we talked about this stuff.

Speaker 1:          00:45:01       And it was nice and maybe I, and I hope and it's a, it's a well made film. I liked the filmmakers have made it, but I found people come up to me, I had no idea of this. It's one of the negative aspects of religion that I never appreciated. I have people come up and he almost everyday I write me and saying, you know what? I saw that movie and I realized I'm not a bad person for asking questions and I'm not alone. You know, these people from small towns in Georgia, they have no one to talk to. They think that the only ones who's asked the question is God real? Is it okay to not believe in God? And they're told by everyone else you'll not only you'll go to hell, but you're a bad person. And suddenly they discover that's not true. And so I think there are a lot of people who have that forced down their throats.

Speaker 1:          00:45:43       It's really hard when you're a kid, you know and have these. And that's why I do think any kind of religion for kids, it's kind of child abuse, not a no matter what, because these concepts have a daily and the possible existence of a purpose of the universe are very deep and subtle concepts and expect a three year old kid to, to, to the ram that down a curial kid's throat is unfair because the kid candidate, resident, it ends up being internalized in ways. And a lot of people, you know, I hear a lot of people who've had deep religious educations who say, you know, it's hard to outgrow that because when you get, when that's thrust into you as a child, it's really hard to over ever overcome it. The guilt feelings that many religions introduce the fundamental notion that, that you know, you're ultimately sinful and no matter what you do is sinful, is something a lot of people have, hard times within that claim of sin is just so you know, I've debated people who, you know, who argue that homosexuality is sinful, you know, and then, and it's unnatural.

Speaker 1:          00:46:45       God intended it to be otherwise. And then I pointed out, well, you know what, you take all mammals, 10 percent in every species, almost 10 percent have homosexual relationships. Sheep have long, 10 percent of sheep have longterm homosexual relationships, or they sinful. Okay? It's not a natural at all. It's a natural consequence of whatever. But now why it's a case, it's an interesting evolution in question, but it's certainly not a natural and it seems uniform than if it's 10 percent. So. Well being a plus or minus a little bit, it certainly seems to be biology. There's some purpose, there's some, there's some biological purpose to it. And so to argue that it's both unnatural and wrong is to misunderstand biology. But people grow up being told it's evil because the Bible said it right? And then they don't want to give people who are homosexual the same rights as other people because they tell them, they say God didn't want them to have the officer. So the problem is people are told these things that are ultimately wrong because you know, maybe you know, because for whatever reason, the tribe that wrote down that that scripture wanted to make sure that there weren't homosexual relationships in the group, which just really

Speaker 2:          00:47:52       baffling when you talk to people about the Bible in the Old Testament versus the new testament and they don't even understand where the new testament was created by Constantine and a bunch of bishops they throw up.

Speaker 1:          00:48:01       And by the way, they think it's kinder, gentler. Sure. The Old Testament is one of the most, you know, look at the current people say the Qur'an is violent and vicious. Read the Old Testament. You know, you're supposed to stone your kids if they disobey you. Yeah. And, and the reason killed people that were two different kinds of clauses. Exactly. And the reason that nowadays, sort of the Abrahamic religions of Judaism and Christianity may seem a little less violent than Islam for some people is because, you know, people take the Quran literally, and that's part of sort of fundamentalist Islam. Very few, very few people take the Bible as literally as namely, Hey, we're going to stone kids in the twelfth century they may have, but now we've outgrown it and the is 600 years younger and so it's just the old testament is just as violent as the Korean, but no one takes it seriously.

Speaker 1:          00:48:50       But people, most people who call themselves religious, they pick and choose the things they like from the Bible or the New Testament or the old testament. They pick and choose the nice kindler, gentler things. You know, Richard Dawkins Foundation in England did an interesting survey. Uh, so they, the British government does a census, you know, and, and they, they asked people's religions as part of it. And in the last census, remarkably only 55 percent of the people said they were Christian church, Church of England, which was one of the lowest ever but fun. They went to those 55 percent people. They did a survey of those and they said, okay, why do you call yourself Christian? Do you believe in the Virgin birth? Do you believe in transubstantiation? Do believe in, you know, and went down the list and people say, no, no, no, no, no. And then they'd ask, why do you call yourself Christian?

Speaker 1:          00:49:31       And the answer was, we'd like to think of ourselves as good people, so religion is usurped, morality, and somehow people throw out all of the evil and it's not just the old testament. No one talks about hell more than Jesus Christ. Okay? Jesus guy is supposed to love. Everyone talked about hell. This eternal damnation for people who disobey, as, as, as Christopher hitchins used to say, God is like a cosmic Saddam Hussein, but worse because Saddam Hussein was just torture his enemies while they're alive, God has worse. He takes the people that I was liking, torches them from all eternity. Who wants such a God? What an awful disgusting idea. My wife bought the sauna thing. You don't want to thing.

Speaker 2:          00:50:12       It's like a sauna suit. You Zip it up and you hit these buttons and it heats it up and heats your body temperature up neat. And it comes from China and it has this hilarious instruction manual because it's translated from Chinese to English by people that are not. I love.

Speaker 3:          00:50:28       Every time I read one of those manuals, I love him. It's unbelievable. It's like make waste of body, go away, excels to fat, disappear like very, very strange stuff. And she was laughing and she was reading. She handed it to me and I go, well, this is the problem with the Bible. One of the big problems in the Bible is translating from ancient Hebrew and Aramaic. And some cases we have not even hit the Dead Sea Scrolls, but ancient Hebrew, the letters doubled his numbers. So there was no number. So when the letter a is the number one and words also had numerical

Speaker 1:          00:50:58       value. And when you think about, I mean, and this is, if you've ever actually ever looked at this, and it's amazing. So people say the Bible, you know, it's just the word of God. But then realize that this came by. In fact, the King James version was decided by a bunch of people who decided what to throw out. There were parts of the of their earlier Bible they didn't like. They threw out. They determined what is now the Old Testament in the King James version, which was a bunch of people who got together

Speaker 3:          00:51:22       and decided to throw things out and how to translate things and what to do. It was people just the word of God. It's a bunch of a bunch of people. Have you ever heard of John Marco Allegro? Mm. Well, I know a lot of people that want to grow, but grow is one of the scholars that was a. He was one of the people that was deciphering the Dead Sea Scrolls and he wrote a book in the 19 seventies called the sacred mushroom and the cross. Oh, I've heard of the book is his determination after 14 years of deciphering the Dead Sea Scrolls at the entire Christian religion was a massive misunderstanding that it was really all about consumption of psychedelic mushrooms. Fertility cults. Yeah. I've heard that. I'm skeptical of that, I should say, but I'm skeptical of everything. It's fascinating. It's fascinating.

Speaker 1:          00:52:03       There are a lot of people who have written really interesting books. On the early history of, of, of the Christian religion and Judaism and I, you know, I know a number of those scholars that it's really fascinating. In fact, there's really great evidence that Jesus wasn't even divide in the early Christian, right? Mean his divinity came about 300 layers later. It's some really interesting work and, and so, uh, religion is evolved and we now take it as if it was sort of was obvious. Apparently according to the books I've been reading lately, there's really good evidence that, you know, not only did Jesus never called himself God, his followers never did either. And, and the, and this resurrection thing was put in later when people want it to make him divine. Wow. And so that's fascinating. Again, you could be skeptical about it. We should be skeptical of everything. But what's really amazing, and this is what bothers me, I wrote a piece for the New Yorker once. It said all scientists should be militant atheist.

Speaker 3:          00:52:57       Yeah. You were really criticized for that. Well, I by some, by some people and the first praised by others. Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:53:03       But the real point is that people criticized me, never read the piece, which often happens for my work because there was the title and the editor chose the title, which is fine, but I wasn't. But what I said was when I simply asked the question, could it be that Jesus was. You know what I just said, could it be that Jesus wasn't always considered divine in the Christian religion? You know, a scholarly question. When asked the question, in many cases, I'm called a militant atheist. How dare you question our doctrine? And I said, if nothing should be, should be above questioning, nothing should in our society, nothing should be sacred. Everything should be open to question. So if simply questioning makes me a militant atheist than all scientists should be melted atheist because we should adore questioning. And so I wasn't arguing, you know, we should be handing out pamphlets and I said we should be asking questions. And so the discussion you and I just had would be viewed by some people and will be viewed by some people as sinful sacrilege. A sacrilege should not be on the air, should not be allowed to have that discussion because how dare we questioned the divinity of Jesus Christ because after all he was God and to question his divinity is to, is to do the work of the devil, and that's so sad because you know you should be questioning

Speaker 3:          00:54:23       and it is fascinating where people draw that line to whether they draw the line at the new testament or whether they go back to the old testament or whether they even bought. I mean, how many people are believers in the Dead Sea Scrolls? I mean, how many people have gone over the work from Iran with a fine tooth comb? Exactly, but by the way, I don't like the word believer.

Speaker 1:          00:54:41       I should say that I use it as well. I think if you're a scientist, you'd never use the word belief. Something's likely or unlikely, but that belief is not a part of the of. If you really want to think of rational inquiry, of course you can have. We all are colloquium. We all have beliefs, which means we have preconceptions, but, but really what we're saying is this is highly likely based on what I think or what I know before and, and

Speaker 3:          00:55:03       learn something. Does it make it more or less likely or I respect that, but if you're a Ta, I use the word belief all the time, but I try not to. Okay. It's one of those things like the word, like I try not to use like in sentences because people like use it like way too much. I just got to be a way. If you go to high school now, fucking kids. Yeah. Um, but it's, it is strange to me that people do draw those arbitrary lines and when they decide that doctrine is real, like they'll tell you, if you start talking to him about the Old Testament and they're trying to be a Christian apologist, they'll say, well, we'll listen. You're talking about the old testament and we don't go by that. We go by that thing. That emperor of Rome created with a bunch of bishops and he wasn't even Christian himself until he was on his deathbed.

Speaker 3:          00:55:43       Well, you know exactly and people, but people like to define themselves and, and I don't want to, you know, it sounds patronizing as if, oh, I'm, you know, we're better. We all believe crazy things. You and I also did. We all were crazy leads. You believe 10 in. Well, here's the, here's what we all believe in impossible things before we get up for breakfast as Lewis Carroll would you say you believe that you'd like to do is carol are a big proponent of acid? Probably when he wrote it may be maybe there's lots of things, but it doesn't matter. The idea is interesting. We all, humans are not rational beings. In order to make it through the day we convince ourself of 10 impossible things might be that you love your wife. It might be that you like your job, it might be what if you do love, you live what you do, love your wife, Lynn. You do love your jobs.

Speaker 1:          00:56:24       It, that's not impossible, but there are other things that you may find. You may find you. You could pick it. You know what I mean? You know, you might find that you, that, that I don't, but do you believe anything weird? I'm sure I do. But you. Do you ever explore it? Of course I try some of the things I probably, I'm a human being so, so I make it through the day. Um, I may convince myself I'm interesting. Interesting. Well that's nice but, but, but you know, I thought you were interesting before I met you and now you've confirmed it. Oh good. I was going to say, now I know, but, but, but you know, I, let me put it this way, make convincing myself I'm handsome and sexy and whatever it is that we all convince ourselves with one of you, if you were in a room full of 100 year old dudes, you'd be handsome and sexy but it.

Speaker 1:          00:57:07       But exactly. But if I'm in a room full of maybe not 100 year old dudes, I may not have issues, but no, but bunch of male models. So we don't have issues. We say, oh yeah, those male models. But they looked like, but that's great. That's great. If you have your eyes wide open. If you're, if you're comfortable enough in the world's going to end, hopefully part of growing up, part of becoming an adult is learning that a lot of the ridiculous notions we had are just that and getting comfortable with that. That's part of maturing I think so when we were now more comfortable in our own skin, we're able to accept those, but I bet when you were a teenager you would have had a harder time saying, you know, all those other guys are better looking and more interesting than me. For sure.

Speaker 1:          00:57:47       Okay. And so, so that's part of growing up and that's what science helps civilization do is grow up. That's a good point. Yeah. Yeah. Boy, do you think that any of those bizarre beliefs are important at all to people today? Or do you think, how do you think society would function if we all abandoned religion and what about the people that have included it as part of the sort of, again, the scaffolding, how they operate and this level who do good things, who there are people who are more generous and give to charity because of religion and help their neighbors and, and go to, you know, at Christmas time go to soup kitchens and all that. There's no doubt that that happened. And they generally do genuinely do experience positive results from solutely. Absolutely. So it's not as if religion breeds badness in everyone, but what people should realize, it's not as if the lack of religion breeds badness is everyone.

Speaker 1:          00:58:37       The question is, is it necessary? Right? Altruism and kindness can exist on their own. Exactly. So when, so you can do all of that. And I know people who go to soup kitchens at Christmas, I'm who are atheists. The point is it's not necessary. So for some people it helps. I would argue that on average, and this is where you can have a debate, but on average I would say the net effect of religion is negative and I know colleagues of mine who some of whom would disagree with me in that, but I think if you look at the net effect of religion on society and the current world and maybe even over human history, the net effect is is is negative and I would argue you could probably get many of the same features if we dispense with religion right now, it'd be a problem because right now for many people, religion gives them a sense of community, of sense of belonging and maybe for a sense of of of comfort it and death and all sorts of things, so we couldn't just sort of it.

Speaker 1:          00:59:31       It provides useful things. As I said before, it fulfills evolutionary purposes. If it wasn't, it wouldn't be so ubiquitous, but I can imagine at least a world where we could fulfill those things in other ways. For example, instead of picking, bringing people together for church every Sunday, we could bring them together for a rock concert every Sunday. Okay, and they'd get the same sense committee or maybe for quantum mechanics class every Sunday, but maybe they might find it fun if it was we made a quantum leap, but they'd find a central or maybe they'd find a sense of community and everyone rolling their eyes just like you did now because I suspect that happens in church a lot too. For sure. Will sunset sense of community is very important to bond people and bring them together and religion does it? Yes, but, but the point is what bothers me is when people say, well, therefore we need religion and the and the answers may be now, but could we imagine building a sense of community because we care about our each other and we have a commonality in other ways.

Speaker 1:          01:00:24       That's another thing that makes science so wonderful, right? I've called the large Hadron Collider, the Gothic Cathedral, a 21st century because the gothic cathedrals were built in the 11th or twelfth century by thousands of artisans over centuries working together. They had different languages, different cultures, different religions may be not so many different religions back then, but they work together. This large Hadron collider is built by 10,000 scientists from over 100 different countries with different languages, different religions. They're working together. They have a commonality science really much more effectively than religion. I would argue binds people globally because religions are still an US versus them thing. I'm Christian, you're a Jew. I'm Christian or Islam or you know, whatever it is. I'm Buddhist. It's always us. Versus them was science in principle. It's anyone can do it and, and we're all working towards a common goal, which is to understand how the universe works.

Speaker 1:          01:01:16       It we're not, we're not interested in, in, in pushing our own picture or joining together to believe anything. That's the other thing people think of is, Oh, you know, scientists push evolution because we all get together and at night and with special rings and talk to each other, say we don't want wanna, we don't want to believe anything else. They don't realize if you're a scientist, the biggest way to become famous and what we all do when we go into work every day is try and prove our colleagues wrong because that's how you really make progress. Hey, something we thought was right is really not what we thought it was. Those are the great discoveries that push people forward. So it's not as if we all buy into the same thing. We're all trying to push knowledge forward, which means we're trying to discover perhaps old biases and, and overcome them.

Speaker 1:          01:02:01       And so scientists are bound together not to push their own. I mean, of course we all have theories, but we're all willing to throw them out if the, if, if the theories are proven wrong and we're all willing to celebrate being wrong. And, and that's a wonderful thing. And I, I, as I always, if you're a theoretical physicist to two favorite states to be enter either wrong or confused because that's great because then you're going to learn something and, and if we are more comfortable with not knowing, which is the other aspect, I think that science for many people is, is terrifying because if you're, if you're deeply believe you know the answers, if you believe really believe there's a god you can, you can put aside that uncertainty. And for many people, uncertainty is terrifying, but be comfortable with not knowing is wonderful and moreover I would argue is better for teachers and for parents.

Speaker 1:          01:02:51       You know, your kids ask you questions and you really want to always give them the answer whether you know it or not, but it'd be much better to say, you know what? I don't know. Let's figure out if anyone knows this. Because then they participate in the joy of discovery. They're not told something by some authority. And same with teachers. I do think we should be teaching questions rather than answers. We should be teaching kids how to question and then how to search for the answers, how to distinguish the wheat from the chaff out, how to distinguish the nonsense from the sense, especially in our society right now. We used to, we used to teach school is if it's just a composite story of information, now we know why I have in my phone. I have more information than in school, but also have more misinformation.

Speaker 1:          01:03:30       How do I tell the difference if the process and that's it. That's what we need to teach in school. The process of skeptical inquiry, relying on evidence, checking many sources, testing your ideas constantly. Then we teach. Those are the tools kids need to to deal effectively in the modern world with a, with an internet that's full of and and with new sources which are equally full of misinformation as well as information and one of the biggest issues I think that people are having with religion in the 21st century is these areas where you're not allowed to question and explore that things hit. These walls were this is God's will and this is the way it is. And in my mind, what we say that is just code word for, I don't want to think about it. It's too confusing. It's too complicated, too terrifying to terrifying and, and that and, or people say, and this amazes me, people, I get people, religious people saying, you will never understand the origin years.

Speaker 1:          01:04:22       You'll never understand what love is. Science will never ever explained love. Science will never ever explained x or will. And then I say, well that's incredibly pompous statement because if you say that science will never explain this, you must understand it because how do you know that will never explain it? We never know what we won't be able to explain until we try. And maybe there are things about our universe that will never understand, but we don't know until we try. You can never say upfront that science will never explain this or that because you haven't tried. And in my experience as a scientist, I've been, you know, I, there could have been brick walls but I've watched progressively those brick walls crumble as we move around them or we break them. And it is so exhilarating. And that's why it's the greatest story ever told. It's so exhilarating to see them knocked down and things you thought we'd never understand. Or I remember one of the forces of nature, a very prominent physicists, the 19 sixties or early 19 actually in [inaudible], 69 said it will be a hundred years before we discover, understand this interaction. Next year the theory came out and it's so wonderful to see how the story surmounts the biases and the anticipation of individual scientists. That's the greatest story ever told so far.

Speaker 3:          01:05:38       Well, what's ridiculous about saying no one will ever figure anything out is that what we figured out over the last 200 years is monumental. And then human language has only been around for 40,000. Absolutely. We live another 50,000 years. 100,000 years.

Speaker 1:          01:05:53       As long as we don't. As long as we keep open inquiry. You could imagine moving. I mean, look, we went through a few hundred years of the Middle Ages where the incredible inquiry based civil culture of the Greeks was just forgotten. I'm, you know, the Greeks had determined the circumference of the earth. Not only that it was round, but what its circumference was by simple measurements that were van not accepted because of dogma. So we have to, if we want to progress, we have to be aware of dogma. How did they figure out the circumference of the earth? So it's really neat. I think it was an aerostar guess I forgot. What year was the Greek. Now it's amazing what he said was, look, so at a certain time of day, in a certain time of the year, the sun is directly overhead at 12 noon. Okay. And in my.

Speaker 1:          01:06:42       So. And I can tell that by looking down a deep well, and I see the reflection of the sun exactly in that deep well, okay. So the race and the sun which are coming down in the same direction towards the earth. Everywhere it comes down to the deep well, but a hundred miles away the well because the surface is curved, the well is pointing a little bit different direction. So the sun's rays come at a slightly different angle. So this on this day I will measure that. The Sun is directly overhead for me, but I'll get my friend 100 miles away to measure the angle of the sun relative to the well, and if you that tells you that the earth is curved and if you do the geometry, you can work out. If the 100 miles of the earth's surface causes the sun's rays to suddenly be at that angle, how curved the earth is and what the circumference of the earth is. It's plain geometry that in principle any high school student could do,

Speaker 3:          01:07:28       but when you say 100 miles away, first of all, how are they communicating with this guy hundred miles away. They're not immediately, but the guy writes it down and then they takes a horse and they come and compare notes later and they use a Sundial to determine the time, the Sun Sundial to determine the time and and the 100 miles a minute away. Would there be a deviation at all in a time, a minute or two? Well that, yep. But so to something accuracy you, you, you, you get it wrong to some accuracy, but they did pretty damn well. They came up with the circumference was darn close to the circumference of the earth, and so, uh, it's amazing that they use these techniques so they were just so confused and so curious about it all. They just tried to figure out what it has got to be a way to figure this out. Well, and they didn't.

Speaker 1:          01:08:08       They weren't, they weren't forced with the dogma that the earth is flat. As you, I've, I've told today you were dealing with people who are still

Speaker 3:          01:08:16       forced with that dogma is very strange. How do you feel about that in 2017? It's amazing, but you know, nothing's surprised. Not only that gravity is not real and dinosaurs aren't real. And you, the people who say gravity are real. I have a great solution, but it's a building. Walk out the window of the 13th floor and test your ideas. And the great thing is do it before you reproduce, but it's a magnetism thing. They believe it's electro magnetism or something like that that suddenly people down to the. Yeah, that's what I'm thinking. Think so perinatal magnet and look at it as what happens as you're falling into the earth? Well, it's even more hilarious is that they. Well, we talked about this before the podcast started, the Japanese weather satellite. That takes an image, a full image of the earth. What is the name of that satellite again, Jamie?

Speaker 3:          01:08:59       It takes a full image of the earth from 22,000 miles ago away. People keep saying in this flat earth theory thing that there's no images of the earth in full at. They're all composites. That's not true. It's not true. There are images of the earth that are taken every 10 minutes by this one satellite and they're high resolution. You can. You can access them online anytime you want, but people see those and they want to think they're fake, but yet they believe there's an ice wall around Antarctica that you crossover and you fall to the abyss. Where's this photo of the ice wall it or have they never? Well, how does someone fly from Japan? They don't believe that people can fly around the world. I've done it, I've done and that they're all lying. Here's no one, have they ever thought at time zones, why are there times zones of the earth says flat where there time zones, the only reason they're telling me they should go from New York to La and see you know what?

Speaker 3:          01:09:51       The time is different. Do they will know, but they probably think it's a human invention, but you know the sun is still shining in la when it's gone down in New York and they can call their friends and check and if the earth was flat, that wouldn't be the case. It's only the case because the earth is curved. I mean, so those simple things should should convince people, but people are willing to throw out evidence if they have a belief. That's really from, and what I said before is we have to realize the easiest person to fool is yourself. So if you're not willing to question your beliefs, especially those that you hold particularly cherished beliefs in, if you're not willing to question those, you're not gonna. You're not gonna ever grow. Yeah, well that's a good way to put a particularly cherish because I think a lot of people do cherish these ideas.

Speaker 3:          01:10:35       Things like the earth being flat because it gives them some sort of information leg up on everybody I know. Something that people don't know what makes them feel better about themselves. They may hate gays because it makes them feel better about not being gay or maybe they are gay, but you know what I mean? You always worry about that. And so I, I think we all, that's what I mean about being believing 10 impossible things for breakfast. We, I don't want to make fun of people because we all do think of things to make us feel better about ourselves. It's part of being human, the psychological pitfalls and so we should be aware of those and I have them in. You have them and I don't pretend I don't. What I do try and do is question them, but we can all do that

Speaker 1:          01:11:14       and I don't, I don't. I understand why people are beliefs. Certain things. It's not. And you can be. Again, Richard Dawkins tells me about an astrophysicist he knows who during the day, you know, studies objects in the sky and, and, and, and looks at at galaxies or stars and measures that they're, that they're 12 billion years old or whatever, and then, but yet he goes home at night and then it's an and is convinced that the earth is 6,000 years old. So somehow we can really do both. Yeah. He knows a guy like, oh yeah, and people can and we're all capable of believing in to mutually contradictory things at the same time. It's just the way we're built. And so how does this guy really measure the cause of these planets? Somehow it doesn't affect his fundamental beliefs and it's amazing. It's true because we can all believe things that are wrong and so it doesn't mean they're stupid.

Speaker 1:          01:12:04       It doesn't mean because this guy is apparently a fairly accomplished astrophysicist. It's the psychological pitfalls, but we all have trap. So, so many people, you know, when I talk about this, I don't want to seem pompous in the sense of saying, Oh, I'm better or scientists are better. Science is better because science helps us overcome those pitfalls. Why do those pitfalls exists though? Because because obviously evolution, I would argue that they have lived in evolutionary purpose that somehow they allow. If they didn't have an evolutionary purpose, then they wouldn't have been selected for. Right? Right. There does seem to be some weird inclination or some desire to expose secrets to find secrets and did know them. Yeah. It's nice. Well, but on the other end, that's great. Let's exploit that. Discovering secrets is about is discovering mysteries. Discovering mysteries is what motivates to do is to do sign, so let's put it in a positive light.

Speaker 1:          01:12:58       We all want to solve puzzles. We all want to understand something and maybe the first one to understand it. We all want to access information may be and make us feel special for doing it. Really, that's the reason I do science, right? It's not save the world. It's because I really wanted to know, understand. I mean, and it's nice to be the first person to maybe understand stuff. It's gratifying for your ego. It's a and we are driven by ego and, and let's not pretend otherwise. Right, but you, I think you're talking about measurable things and elements and things that you could sort of expose and explain, but what these people seem to be really obsessed with is people lying about stuff and covering up secrets about the earth being flat or chem trails. Yeah. They'd like to believe there's a conspiracy. Conspiracy's are very, very attractive.

Speaker 1:          01:13:43       Yeah. Because it. Because, and I, you know, I don't, I'm not a psychologist, so what I say here is just speculation, but the world doesn't care what you believe and it doesn't treat you fairly. Right? Right. And that's just a fact. The world, he doesn't treat me fairly, doesn't treat you fairly. It doesn't give a damn if it's my wellbeing or, okay, so, Hey, I'm being treated unfairly. Isn't it better for me to think that someone is actively being unfair to me than just assume it's just the way it is? Because then I can blame it. And so I tend to think conspiracy theorists tend to say, you know, the things I don't like, there's a real reason for it. It's not an accident. It's not just haphazard, it's not anything. And in and it, you know, it's, I've lost my job because there's gotta be a reason. There's got to be a villain. There's got to be someone making it happen. Just like the reason we burned witches. Right? Because there were storms or there wasn't. It wasn't crops that year. And a lot of people say it's an interesting historical theory, which I think is seems quite plausible to me that when Newton discovered the laws of gravity, the universal law of gravity, it contributed to the ending of the burning of witches.

Speaker 2:          01:14:54       Well, I thought that that was a, meant the burning of witches. I thought they drowned them mostly. Well

Speaker 1:          01:14:58       had they hung a lot of them too. They drown them. Where do. I don't care whether it's burning. They killed her. I understand. Okay. They blamed crops. They blamed the bad things. And then when Newton discovered that even the planets are affected by the same laws that Annapolis, there's a universal laws. It meant that physical effects had physical causes and when bad things happen, there's a physical reason there's not someone you can blame and and witches or whatever. And so there's a lot of arguments that suggests that that kind of development and physics led to the end of blaming people for those for bad crops or, or for bad things happening. But I think that's the kind of thing when we. We want to find someone to blame rather than just saying the universe doesn't give a shit

Speaker 2:          01:15:40       about me and anybody interested in this is a really fascinating subject. But the whole Salem witch trial thing. Then there's a lot of really convincing evidence that seems to point towards ergot poisoning. That there was some, a late freeze and that this particular type of fungus grew on some of their wheat that makes Origami, which is a very. Has very lsd like properties. And they think these people thought they were being bewitched because they're being contaminated. It's, it's a great idea if the evidence for it, but it's interesting. I know it is fascinating, but let's, but let's,

Speaker 1:          01:16:11       can we all I think behind that is, is uh, you know, we've all had. I mean, I think what we're seeing are extremes of characteristics that we all have. I think many of us assign blame when we shouldn't. When I lose my keys, sometimes I see them out. Where do you put the, my wife, where did you put the keys? Right? And then I learned very quickly that I shouldn't have said that. And so I think it's just an, it's a characteristic of being human and accepting it as a characteristic of being human. It doesn't diminish us, but what's really great is we can understand that and try and work and, and try and figure out ways to avoid

Speaker 2:          01:16:52       those pitfalls. So a lot of these ways of thinking, these patterns of thinking, these are sort of hold offs from the ancient days. That's the things that helped us to survive those pathways now are counterproductive.

Speaker 1:          01:17:03       And, and I ran a meeting at my origins project is about the origins of xenophobia and w and w no US versus them, and it turns out there's really useful Zena evolutionary purposes for us versus them tribal purposes and not just that actually it goes back to biochemistry. Immune systems is us versus them just being able to recognize foreign bodies and cells. So it goes back to single cell organisms, but then the question is, is it now got to uh, uh, is, is, is it now run its course and become on, of course, to be counterproductive. Exactly. And then we have to look at those things and ask what their is and if we explore those things, then then there's a better chance that we can deal with them and asked what's useful and what isn't. But if we refuse to acknowledge that those things exist and that they may be the purpose of our religion or our beliefs or whatever, then we're, then we can't possibly overcome them.

Speaker 1:          01:17:59       Or You. I'm going to change gears a little bit. Are you concerned at all about ai? Yeah, we will. Yes. We just had a workshop again at my origins project in which you can watch it online, the public event anyway. Where can. Someone said, Oh wow, dot origins dot Asu Dot Edu. We run these amazing events and what's neat to me by the way, is we get 3000 people attending the pain to attend. People really want to hear science if it's done right and interestingly. That's awesome. Yeah, I'm, I'm. I'm so pleased and privileged that we, that people find things that interesting and come over and over again, but so we ran this, this event called the future of ai who's in control because associated with. We had a scientific workshop on what are the possible disruptive influences of Ai. Now Ai is gonna change the world.

Speaker 1:          01:18:44       It's going to. The future is not going to be like the past. What it means to be human is not going to be like it was the past. Get over it. Now the question is some of those things which we think are horrible, may not be so bad. For example, the ancient Greeks thought the introduction of writing would be horrible because oral storytelling would be destroyed, but writing wasn't such a bad thing. It actually made the world kind of maybe a more interesting place. It maybe, maybe ai will take over certain functions that humans have teaching or doctoring or whatever, and maybe it won't be so bad. Okay. Maybe it maybe it seems terrifying for us, but maybe won't be so bad. On the other hand though, you can imagine awful consequences, ones that are already bad. So we. We looked at these disruptive possible consequences and the point is it can have both.

Speaker 1:          01:19:33       What's really important is, unless you think about it, pasture said fortune favors the prepared mind ultimately. So yes, Ai is both terrifying and exciting. The future is terrifying and exciting. For example, I'm really excited by the possibility that ai might become better physicists in us, and I'd like to know. I'd like to know how intelligent computers, especially intelligent quantum computers understand quantum mechanics. They may understand it better than we do and I might learn from them. So maybe there'll be the dominant physicists in the future of the dominant academics and we can learn from them. We can learn from intelligent artificial systems that wouldn't be so bad. Maybe it seems like it'd be bad, but what's wrong with that? It's really rose colored glasses though what that, that may be. But on the other hand, it could be that, that, that, that intelligent is ai decides that there's no need.

Speaker 1:          01:20:29       For example, here's something that, that one of the people who was at our workshop and Yon Tallen who, who founded skype was one of the coordinators of our workshop and he says, well, you know, oxygen is really bad for, for, uh, oxidation of, of, uh, of, of uh, electronic systems. Okay? So if ai could control, you know, a technology, they might want to systematically reduce the oxygen content of the atmosphere, right? That wouldn't be so good for humanity. Okay. So you can imagine the other extreme where basically intelligent ai systems control most of the technology in the world and maneuver things. So humans become extinct. So you can, you can imagine one realm or the other, but unless you think about the ways that you can try and and ensure that the future is as good as can be, you've got to at least confront those possibilities.

Speaker 1:          01:21:22       You don't put your head in the sand and you don't go, oh my God, the world is ending. You say, look, this is going to. There are changes are going to happen. For example, Ai will displace millions of people from their work. You know, the, the, there's no doubt if not billions, if billions. Let's say billions. Now, what's that going to do? Well, there are two. There are two possibilities and one of them was imagined by John Maynard Keynes when he thought about what industrialization would do. He said, you know, the effects of it is that machines are going to do a lot of the work that people are going to do. But the great thing is that'll free people from the work. There'll be able to go have coffee and coffee shops, go see read books, do you know see plays. The quality of their life will improve.

Speaker 1:          01:22:02       But of course that didn't happen because you know, the, the increased resources that were decreased, increased money and, and, and, and all of that that was generated by industrialization wasn't, wasn't uniformly distributed at some point when we are billions of people out of work, we're going to have to decide to say, you know, what, those machines that produced a higher net quality potential quality of life for everyone. Maybe we have to spread the wealth, maybe some sort of universal basic income. And I think frankly, we have a choice either we as machines begin to do just that. We have a choice to move in that direction. It seems to me. Or we have a choice to move in a direction of incredible socio economic, uh, problems and Tom Moulton and, and, and that's going to create huge, huge societal problems. And I'm worried that in our society, for example, that doesn't even want to provide healthcare to everyone where some people say, why should I pay for you when you're sick?

Speaker 1:          01:22:59       Even though we live in a society that's wealthy enough to do just that, that will never get to a point where we say, you know what, these machines have generated incredible wealth. Let's allow all the people who've been displaced to to, to benefit from that wealth. I suspect that won't happen, and I, I, I, I'm, I'm pessimistic about the future. Otherwise my friend Cormac McCarthy says, because he's a really chipper fellow, but he writes very dark books and when I first met him I said, how can you be so cheerful? And he said, you know, I'm a pessimist, but that's no reason to be gloomy and that's become my mantra ever since then. That's a great statement. Yeah, I love it. Now, what I'm worried about with ai is that we're looking at it as if it's an invention. It's a human invention, which most certainly is, but it's also a life form.

Speaker 1:          01:23:46       What I'm worried about is that it decides, well, eventually, if you extrapolate, yeah, but okay, so big deal. Well that it decides to make a better version of itself. Then it continues to do that and we're going to be completely obsolete within a shorter amount of time. Great. Really? Well, I mean no law, so that's could be good or bad. So it's to this note, but this is your illusion that you're significant with. No, I'm not, it's not. It just stay alive long enough to die of old age, but maybe eaten by robots. So there's lots of things that, that don't have any real purpose. But what would the robots, you know, if you want to go with robots, would it be and why would they feel it's necessary to destroy us? Because we're polluting the environment we made. We made your world. Well, not when we're, when we're not governing things.

Speaker 1:          01:24:31       We might not be, you know, we might want to say they might want to save us like we do the turtles and, or you know, in various places they don't want the lights to happen because the turtles don't. Don't, you know, mate, if the lights are on the beach and we don't do such a good job of, we don't, but there'll be better than us. Right? Right. But what we might be an evil hyena like species, if we are, then why should we be around? That's a good question. But I mean I'm worried about that. Well no, but maybe give us a chance to get better, but maybe you could view them as your offspring and then you then, then you say, look at my offspring. And in fact actually I do think ultimately if, if, if, if machines can, can program themselves and ultimately come better than it will be difficult for biology to keep up.

Speaker 1:          01:25:13       And our future is humans will be, could easily be what you would call the Borg in Star Trek. Could easily say the only sensible ways to merge. Right? And, and, and you know, what's really interesting. So then the dominant life form, it'll be really interesting. So we tend to think of why, why are carbon based individuals that dominant life form in the universe. But it could be if we're looking at the out in the universe of looking at the dominant life form their silicon based, they're not carbon based and, and, and, and, and it'd really be interesting because in this case it would be intelligent design. You can imagine a bunch of intelligent computers having a podcast in the far future. So, you know, I think we were designed by these, by these monkeys and they would be right. Yeah. That's what's really fascinating is the idea that we are some sort of a, not just a creator, but that we're the predecessors

Speaker 2:          01:26:04       of some greater species

Speaker 1:          01:26:06       and who, who knows who knows what the is going to be. But, but to be afraid of the future, it's inevitable. Ultimately what can happen will happen, will happen. We just have to accept that and we have to try and, and, and prepare for it as best as possible to try to make sure it works out as well as possible. I begin this book, the greatest story ever told so far with the, of a quote from, from Virgil, from the idea saying the. I think these are the tiers of things in there. I should, you know, I don't know if you have a copy of the book around. I was going to bring my name, but I'm sure you'd have with you anyway, and the stuff of our mortality costs us to the heart. That's a Latin phrase that people remember that famous, but the next phrase in the night and eight, which I talked about, the very last page or two of the book is this phase release your fear and I think that's the important thing, that stuff overall mortality does cause us to the heart, but release your fear, use it to make our brief moment in the sun more precious,

Speaker 2:          01:27:05       but it's fascinating to me that we're so connected to this particular form that we find ourselves in now and that we were. We're so attached to it and that even though we know that we are a finite life form as individuals. Some people don't. Yeah, go on what I'm saying irrationally, but we know that we're a finite life form. We would like to think that we stay in this state for as long as

Speaker 1:          01:27:27       history and we would like to wait, but you know, but of course we're just temporary. We've run as humans, even that's almonds. Homo sapiens have only been around for a Spec of time, a couple hundred thousand years. Right? And who would expect our future to be the same, but yeah, of course it can be. And, and what if, what if, what if? The things that are wonderful about our culture are preserved by our descendants, but our descendants aren't carbon based. Okay. So what's wrong with that? Why do you, why do you care if your great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great grandchildren look like you, right? I mean, of course we all do because we want somebody mortality. Right? Okay. So the robots are made to look like you. I mean, I don't care, you know, they all have Joe Rogan faces on them in front of them or did you see x Makena?

Speaker 1:          01:28:12       Yeah. Yeah. And Yeah, and I've talked to Alex Garland who was a hesitation there. There was a little nod and you know, as, when I, when I, of course whenever I see science fiction, I, I try to suspend disbelief. Okay. I think the idea, in fact, I showed a clip from smacna in our event because, uh, because I think there are many possible negative consequences of, of, of artificial intelligence. One of them is malevolence, but the other is unintended negative consequences. And I thought Max Malkin it was, it was a wonderful example of unintended negative consequences of artificial intelligence. I don't think that lovely young woman was designed to be evil, but it was an unintended consequence when she saw an opportunity for herself and the other one I showed, of course it's from 2001 a space. The great how warehouses. Sorry Dave, I can't do that.

Speaker 1:          01:29:04       And, and, and, and I think, uh, I think it's wonderful and thoughtful and it was thought provoking. And I, and as I say it, I've come to know Alex Garland who wrote it and directed as innocent and, and he's a very thoughtful, interesting guy and one of my favorite all time movies. I love that. Yeah, it's a really interesting movie. I agree. Uh, I always, I always try and analyze it afterwards and sometimes as a scientist I, I, I, I try not to get in the way of liking science fiction because of course they all involve suspending disbelief and certain things in. And the difference between good science fiction and bad science fiction is not how scientifically accurate it is. It's how good a story it is because if it's a good story, you can suspend disbelief easily. Uh, someone was asking me the other day on a, on a science fiction podcast where it said, you know, what's the worst example of this? And, and, and the example that comes to mind is, I remember in New York Times reporter after the physics of Star Trek came out said, can I go with you to a science fiction movie and watch you and then talk to you about it? And so we went to see a starship troopers and this is the stupidest movie of all time because. Well, because they're, you know, because, because you know, these, these ants poop out things at supersonic speeds about cross the galaxy. I mean, you know, that's amazing, but it's stupid.

Speaker 1:          01:30:20       What's a very campy movie, right? Yeah, I know, but when the problem is, because he was asking me to look at the reality of. I couldn't even suspend disbelief if I want it to, but that. But it's things like that. For example, when something happens, it's suddenly takes you out of the story. You suddenly go, Oh shit, here's another one, another movie I hate called ghost, maybe liked it with, you know, the family more Demi Moore and what's his face? Right. And here's the idea. So this guy's a ghost, right? And he, he, he, he wants to show his long lost love leads around. It's beautiful. It's wonderful. So he tries to lift a penny, but of course it goes through his hands, right? He tries to hug her, but it's hands go right to her. But you noticed each time he stands on the floor, sits on the couch.

Speaker 1:          01:30:58       He stands on the floor and sits on the couch. So his butt or his feet have some incredible ability to be stopped by matter, but nothing else does. I mean, I saw that the rest of the movie went. That's a good point. I didn't even think about it now. I didn't want to ruin it for you, but I just. Well, I saw it when I was like 10 older. It's an older movie. How old? When is that movie? I probably wasn't 10. I was probably 20 or something. Yeah, well I'm older. It's a stupid movie. It is. It is. But, but, but for that, what I'm saying is the minute I saw that it was hard for me to enjoy the rest of the movie. Plus they have an unhealed bit, which also sounds stupid. So sometimes, sometimes, sometimes something like that when you're in. It doesn't have to be science, it can be watching a drama and you say, why the hell did they do that?

Speaker 1:          01:31:41       It's just how to share Sheriff Dermot. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And then. And then it's hard for you to enjoy the rest of the movie. Yeah, I find that all the time. I have a real issue with that. Um, when you think about artificial intelligence, do you consider like one of the things that freaks me out is that what we consider life will, when we think about instincts and needs and desires, those won't necessarily be programmed at all into any artificial life. Well, one of the questions that arises, and this is a huge point of discussion among ai researchers because I've been to a bunch of meetings in preparation for our meeting is whether, and I find the statement almost vacuous, but I'm amazed that they use it all the time to program machines with human values, right? Why would we be programming? And my problem is what our human values.

Speaker 1:          01:32:30       And they said, well, one of the, it was a very smart guy and I won't, I won't say who said this meeting. Well, they just have to watch us. And I said, what do you mean they watched Donald Trump? And they know what human values are. I mean, come on, I'm not sure there are universal human values and so. So how do we program them in. But neverless the question is do we want to align their programming? In what way? In terms of what we think will be beneficial to us, right? Because after all we're programming them, so we do do we in part St [inaudible] values? Who knows? I mean, I find that a very interesting question and a very difficult one to resolve. I my own feeling is if it were up to me and I am not, it's not an area of active research for me.

Speaker 1:          01:33:10       You produce the smartest machines you can. Just like you have kids. I have kids. Do we want them to believe everything we believe? No. We want to give them. We want them to become the most capable human beings they can be so that they can go out and do the best stuff. Right? So why is it different for computer? I'd want to make the most capable, intelligent, resourceful machine I ever could because then I, at least all the evidence suggests to me that that machine will make the best decisions. All right? But if the machine doesn't have an ability to breed sexually and if it doesn't have ego and if it doesn't necessarily have creativity because it doesn't need to be praised for its ego, I don't think we, I don't think creativity comes from needing to be praised for you. I think creative, I mean as another great intrinsic aspects of human beings that makes being a human being worth being human being.

Speaker 1:          01:33:55       Well I think I agree with you, but I think if you're going to connect that sort of mindset to a computer or to artificial intelligence, don't you think it would have some need to create like what? What is our need to create as like we like to express ourselves to other people. If you were alone on an island, do you think it would create? Yeah, sure. Here's of yourself forever. You think you would paint on? I'd like to think I would because I. because I kind of. Because that's what I find gratifying. But I think one of the things people find gratifying is it that other people are enjoying it. So no, I don't do science because other people enjoy it. And do science because I enjoyed. And, and um, and so you think you would do science if you were the last person on earth?

Speaker 1:          01:34:32       You would be alone with what I do. The work I do is, I mean I don't want to make any pretense. I do it because it's fun for me and I think most people do it. They may claim actually I shouldn't say there are people probably better than me who do what they do because they're constantly trying to save humanity in one way or another. I like to think what I do has a net positive effect and I try to take time out of my science to try and counter things that I think are wrong with the world because I have a cause because of my background and also because I have a soapbox. I'm lucky enough to have people listen to me for one reason or another. So I try to take that responsibility seriously. But on the whole I do what I do because I enjoy doing it.

Speaker 1:          01:35:08       I think most of us do and we only do it. We're only good at it if we're good at it because we enjoy it and look at, here's an example, so the best one of the best machine learning machines and existence just beat the best go player in the world. Right? Right. How to do it. It learned, constantly. Learn, taught itself to you better go, okay, that's creativity if you want. It's trying to be better at playing the game, but didn't I just calculate every single note? No, no, no. It can't. It can't do that. What it can do is try to teach itself strategies that work and just creativity and look at it and it does teach itself strategies at work, new strategies by looking at old strategies that didn't work. That's creativity. I mean who knows how to define creativity in all senses, but you can imagine that a sufficiently intelligent computer would be creative because in order to do physics and science, you need to be creative.

Speaker 1:          01:36:02       You know? In fact, I was just. I just did an event with Alan all day in New York City and I all the from Mash. Yeah. Yeah. Who's a great guy at intelligent man and very interesting science and science communication. We've done a few events together. One with my origins project we can see online, so he was interviewing me or we had a dialogue, but he was interviewing me about the new book and and, and, and in the context of that and science communication. And he said something wonderful both there in earlier he said, because it's so counter intuitive to modern culture's reception. He said, art requires rigor. Science requires creativity. And I thought, wow, because that's the opposite of what most people think, but in fact, science, art requires rigor. You gotta just get just the right colors and, and, and work really hard to get the right patterns.

Speaker 1:          01:36:50       Whether that art is music or you know, buy art. I'm looking very broadly. Whereas to do science makes progress because we're creative. It's also rigorous, but people somehow have this artsy fartsy notion that oh, artists are creative and scientists are nerds. You know, they're just, they're just rigorous. Science is just rigorous garbage. It's not, it's creative. Just like art and art is rigorous. And the scientists who say, oh, these artists, these musicians, they're not, they're not as good as we are, they're equally bad because the art and doing anything well requires rigor, discipline, effort, and rigor. And I think that that beautiful dichotomy, that juxtaposition of art and rigor and science and creativity is something wonderful that Alan said and, and we should realize that it's a characteristic science is, does involve creativity and rigor, but so does all the areas of human activity that make the, the story of humans so wonderful.

Speaker 1:          01:37:43       That's why it's the greatest story ever told so far. Well, many, many aspects of human life require creativity. Many endeavors right here and right. Whether you're a better kickboxer, I mean, there's a lot of creativity and fighting, eager to learn rules. Sure. Discipline your muscles over and over again. Any sportsperson and maybe there's even, maybe there's even creativity and football, but, uh, uh, you know, there's Gregor and creativity and anything that humans push to the limits. Yeah, no, I absolutely agree. The question would be, what would the motivation of artificial intelligence be if it's not, if it doesn't have any. We were essentially riding on the motivations of our ancient genetics. We want to have sex for gas. Exactly, and it'd be interesting to see those. What would it be interesting to find out, right? Well, what would their motivation to be creative because because we've.

Speaker 1:          01:38:36       We've developed in them problem solving capabilities and because they're self aware and the amount of asked questions because they're self aware. They may want to improve their understanding of the world. Partly for technology. They may want to make the world better for themselves. All sorts of reasons, but we'll, we'll see. Have to some extent will import it, it programming, but to some extent we'll see and to some people that's terrifying that we won't know the motivations. Of course not as terrified about it. I guess I'm concerned that we got to make sure we understand what we're doing at each step so we don't produce massive negative results that could have been avoided, but I'm not as concerned that the future will be different than the past. I hope it is.

Speaker 1:          01:39:21       When you see some of the emerging technologies like Crispr, some of these genetic engineering technologies where they're starting to use non-viable human fetuses and run some tests on them, are you concerned at all about that? Are you concerned about, or I shouldn't need to use this term, the term concern because obviously you're obviously mindset. No, no, no, no. I'm concerned has happened. No, no. It's not. Just let things happen. Let Watch what's going to happen. Trying to anticipate the results, understand them in detail, anticipate what the results are and avoid negative ones to the extent you can, but it's life is all about the things are going to change, but to accept the fact that things are gonna change and if and, and that's not, that's, that's why aren't we happy that the world is different than it was during medieval times. I mean, except for you know, Mike Pence and other people with the rest of us are happy or you know, that can pick a lot of radio commentators, but most of us are happy that we, that the world has gotten more open, more interesting.

Speaker 1:          01:40:22       And so that's part of the human drama is that it's going to go places and we don't know where it's going to go and that's okay, but we should all work as much as we can to try and make sure to the extent that we can, that the direction of heads is a good one is, is beneficial, more interesting, more exciting, more possibilities, more fun for everybody and, and maybe even more sustainable because it seems reasonable that it should be sustainable if we think we care about not just our children but our grandchildren and their grandchildren. And so that it's self interest in some sense, you know, to be interested in, in conservation and sustainability instead of immediate profit. If you really have, of course, you know, might say if I amass enough wealth and my children will be fine forever and who gives a damn about the rest of the people's children.

Speaker 1:          01:41:07       But you know, we can decide that maybe it's in the best interests of everyone. If humans societies sustainable because there'll be less likelihood for extreme, more extreme violence, blah, blah, blah. You can. I would argue that we behave well in large part because of reason and and and my point is, and I've had this, we had a session in my origins project, a whole meeting on the origins of morality and and I've had this debate with a number of colleagues who point out, I think it was hume who said you can't get ought from is okay, you can't get off from it is just by rationality. You can't decide how to behave. Maybe, maybe, but here's the point without, is you can never get to ot without knowing the consequences of your actions, which is what science is all about. You can't decide what's good and bad and so science and reason is an essential part of any progress because we can't possibly decide what economic policies to enact or what or what social policies are, what technological policies if we don't know the consequences of actions. That's why, for example, here's an example. It was so stupid for the Republicans to design this healthcare policy and promoted before anyone in analyzed say the economic impact of it. I mean, they could have still decided to do it. It's not as if but, but at least that data would have been useful for making a final decision. It's that simple.

Speaker 1:          01:42:30       What? I guess getting back to that crispr thing, if that becomes available and if it advances to the point where it's available to people that are alive today, would would you, would you give it a shot? Would you change anything about yourself? Would you become thor? I mean if it really gets to that point where we can worry about a lot of things, but I'm not anywhere near as worried about that as am hacking. Right? Right. Because if we can hack computers and if you can hack the DNA as a lot of kids want to do. In fact, I was told years ago, I'm chairman of the board of something called the bulletin of atomic scientists that have the board of sponsors that sets the doomsday clock every year and so we have to think about existential threats to mankind. I remember about seven or eight years ago, we had a, a fresher from mit who said his computer science students were most interested in hacking DNA.

Speaker 1:          01:43:15       Much more interested than hacking because it's just an attitude, it's just a code and and so if you could manipulate arbitrarily in a very precise way, DNA, then of course there are many good things that can come and maybe you can make yourself stronger, bigger, whatever you want. Maybe we're not you, maybe your children, whatever, and maybe you can overcome genetic diseases, which of course would be great, but you can also with, you know, with great power comes great responsibility. And with that you can also imagine hacking, right? And creating new viruses or whatever you want. And so yeah, it's, it's any new technology is terrifying. Does mean we shouldn't create new technologies. I mean, cars are terrifying. Cars kill. Look how many people cars get killed now maybe we'll have self driving cars. Maybe fewer people die. Some people are afraid of self driving cars because they do present moral problems and it's as if a car is designed to minimize the number of people it kills and it can do that by killing you. If you're faced with running into five school children or the car turning and hitting a wall, what do you want your car program to do? And it's, these are fascinating questions we will have to address, but technology can, so technology can be used in many ways and it's terrifying. But uh, it's trite to use this old expression, but I do think of it at times, which is that the little thing I gave him a stepdaughter once, it said ships are safe in the harbor, but that's not what ships are meant to do.

Speaker 1:          01:44:42       I mean, if you can, you can bury your head in the sand. You can never go outside the house for fear of being run over by a car or being embarrassed or whatever. Or you can choose to live a life. It's your choice. But to me, living the life as it is more interesting. That's why it in, in, in the, in the book I point out you can choose how to look at the world. You can choose to say you're the center of the universe and if that makes you feel better finding the universe was created for you, or you can choose to let your beliefs conform to the evidence of reality and go and assume the universe exists in evolved independent of your existence, and in that case you're bound to be surprised. Isn't it better to be able to have a life full of surprises and a life that doesn't have any?

Speaker 3:          01:45:24       No. It's a wonderful philosophy. What I'm thinking is I'm wondering about these technological advancements when it comes to the ability to manipulate the human body and when they get to the point where we, we don't have the same issues that we have today with diseases and when injuries or even with a biological inferiorities with everyone. Looks like Lebron James. Yeah. Yeah. Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:45:45       You could imagine that's the case. I, I, I suspect people will want different things, but okay. That'll be a very different world, but look at this way. Um, you're a pretty buff guy. Okay. You manipulated your body, right? Yes. Okay. What's wrong with that?

Speaker 3:          01:46:01       No, nothing, but I'm still five foot eight. Okay. Lebron James is seven feet tall and manipulated his body. It's a very different deal. Someone gives me a seven foot tall pill. I might take it. Yeah, but you manipulate your body given the technology of the time. Right, but you did what? You do changes and everyone can seven feet tall and it was at worse because you can manipulate because you know enough physiology now or whatever. Exercise physiology that you can manipulate your body more efficiently now than you could before and people can run faster miles or jump higher because we've been sports for forever and so that's okay. You know, that's fine. I'm just wondered what your thoughts are on the future. Well, I physiological imbalance. I try to anticipate the abilities

Speaker 1:          01:46:41       and to the extent I can discuss what they are so that we as a society could address them more cogently. I do not. However, generally predictions about anything less than 2 trillion years in the future. That's a great quote. What's going to happen 2 trillion years when the universe expanding to the point of cooling off and everything dies. There's two reasons for that statement. One is it's pretty simple. When you start thinking about the longterm is the universe is probably going to expand forever, all the galaxies, and if it doesn't, the sun's burning out. Anyway, point is if it doesn't do that, no one's gonna know I was wrong. That's a good point. That's a very good point. Yeah, so yeah, so that's why. Yeah, that's my general. I've read a quote once about supermassive black holes that has matched with my brain ever since I read it.

Speaker 1:          01:47:26       Okay, and the quote was that inside every galaxy is a supermassive black hole that's one half of one percent of the mass of the galaxy and that it's very possible that inside that supermassive black hole is a whole nother universe. Well, the up to up to that, what does that mean? Up to that point? Everything's fine. Everything sounded fine. Okay. It is true that it's amazing that most galaxies that we can measure have large black holes on center, which leads to an inch. The question we don't have the answer to, right? One of the reasons we're building the James Webb space telescope. The James, what James Webb Space Telescope. The one that's going to replace the Hubble space colors that. Is that going to be in space? Yeah. Yeah. It's going to be much further orbit. It's going to be launched next year and it's the. It's the successor to James Webb is going to be 100 times the the collection area.

Speaker 1:          01:48:11       It's going to look at different wavelengths of light. It's going to push what Hubble has been able to do to look back to the earliest galaxies that ever formed first light as we call them and starts first turned on the first stars that formed in the universe. It's going to be fascinating, but there's a chicken and egg question. If most galaxies have supermassive black holes in them, which came first and did the black holes form and that was necessary for the galaxies to coalesce around them or did the galaxies existed, and then the black holes built up hierarchically by swallowing things and getting bigger and bigger and bigger. It's a question we don't know the answer to. When we build that thing, we might have the answer to it. It'll be an interesting question that we resolve. It is amazing that as far as we can tell, these supermassive black holes exist even though we don't know they're black holes.

Speaker 1:          01:48:52       By the way. We know they kind of looked like black holes and quack like black holes and walk like black hole black holes, but we. What I mean is there we can tell their mass contra concentrations that are immense. A billion solar masses in a region so small that our theories tell us they should be a black hole, but we don't know if, if, if, if the consequences of generality tell us that they are black holes, but we. The simplest assumption is that they are, that nothing escapes from them, that they, that they formed classically like black holes and they're fascinating and we'll learn about. We're learning about black holes by the way or putative black holes in ways we never thought we could because we now have a new window in the universe. Gravitational waves. These, this ligo detector just detected graves gravitational waves from colliding black holes to coalesce and just discovered that the predictions of general relativity or validated, it's a whole.

Speaker 1:          01:49:43       We're like Galileo, when he first turned his telescope to the heavens and saw the moons of Jupiter, we've just opened a new window on the universe and it will be the new astronomy, the 21st and 22nd centuries and we will learn things we had no knowledge about because that new window will reveal to us the dynamics of black holes in ways we never thought possible. So it's an amazing time to be alive. And I attended. Think that's also a time invariant statement. But, but anyway, so everything. So the black. But what happens inside black holes is a question that's much different and the answer is we don't know. We don't know. We know classically, if general relativity tells us what's happening, we know that this things will collapse to an infinitely dance singularity, but you know, most of us physicists think infinite is a pretty bad word that in than in physical reality, things don't get into dense that the laws of quantum mechanics, you're going to change things and when things get sufficiently dense so that quantum mechanics has to be applied to gravity and the only time that really happens operationally or either the beginning of our universe when our entire observable universe was in, in potentially and infinitely dense singularity or at the center of black holes.

Speaker 1:          01:50:55       That's the only places where that matters. When quantum mechanics must be applied to gravity. Our current physical theories breakdown, so we don't know what happens in the ultimate state of black holes. We don't know. One possibility is indeed they do our portal to another universe. Because what's really interesting is when what you see from the inside of a black hole and the outside are very different. If you're inside of a black hole in space could look like it's expanding. Whereas outside the black hole, it can look like the black hole is contracting. Why is that? Because general activity tells you that your, that your perceptions of what space is doing around you in some sense depends upon your the gravitational configuration in which you live. You live in general, you can be moving and standing still at the same time. We're doing it right now.

Speaker 1:          01:51:44       I'm not moving much with respect to you. I had a little bit of coffee so I'm shaking a little bit but but, but relative to a radio conversations that are happening in the studio at the other end of the visible universe, we're moving away at the speed of light and those individuals having that conversation are also at rest and their local surroundings, but they're moving away from us at the speed of light. How is that possible? Because locally spaces at rest, but globally space is expanding. So generativity says that what you consider to be happening to space around you depends on your local environment and what you defined so you can locally be at rest, but globally be part of an expanding universe. Similarly, inside of a black hole, the direction of time reverses, it turns out because space and time are tied together. So if you see so, so what you perceive inside of a black hole to be happening, um, to, to, to the time evolution of the system you're in would be very different than what's seen from outside to be happening at the surface of the black hole.

Speaker 1:          01:52:47       I mean, whack holes are fascinating and there are laboratories of the boat that allow us to focus on the physics. We can't yet fully understand how long have we known about them? Well, the idea of a black hole was first thought about, uh, uh, people wondered whether what was the ultimate state of gravitational collapse and people that argued that maybe the ultimate state of gravitation collapse was these things called that we now call black holes. There was a big debate about it. Oppenheimer and Snyder in the 19 forties and fifties, the person who first named black holes was John Wheeler. It amuses me. He came up with the term black hole in 1965 or something like that to describe the ultimate state of collapsing met people felt it was impossible. There'd be that physically forces would stop things from collapsing to the kind of densities that black holes would format, but based on the work of Sake Saker and others, it was discovered that if you have a more massive object that's massive enough nuclear forces and all other forces cannot fight against gravitational collapse and eventually things will collapse inside of what we call the event horizon.

Speaker 1:          01:53:50       It's the ultimate say clap that it was hugely debated in the thirties, forties, fifties. By the 19 sixties it was accepted and interestingly enough, wheeler was one who first thought it couldn't happen later on, came up with the name black holes and I think that's one of the reasons that people are so fascinated by black holes. Turns out in Russian, the term for black hole was frozen star and you don't see movies made in Russia, but about frozen stars. You see a lot of movies about black holes is a great name. Yeah. And you know why the weights, why it's a frozen start. Let me blow your mind a little bit. Okay. When objects are falling into, so one of the things you need to know is the rate at which our talk, our clocks tick depends on the gravitational field we're in. So if I'm way above the earth's surface, my clock is ticking at a different rate than your clock.

Speaker 1:          01:54:39       This sounds so crazy, but we needed every day because you know, what did you use gps at all today? Wouldn't have worked if it wasn't for that. Because the clocks and the set gps satellites are ticking at a different rate than the clocks on earth because of general relativity because they're in a different. They're higher up with respect to the earth. So they had to calculate. We have to know, use that effect to Qa to correct. If it wasn't for that case, your GPS would go out of alignment and less than one minute. We use it every single day. So explain that please. So the GPS, the GPS, global positioning satellites that are in orbit, they take into account the fact that there are higher above the earth, that their clocks are ticking more slowly than ours. How do we know that? Because how do they know where we are by by a triangulation, they.

Speaker 1:          01:55:25       They basically look at the time it takes. They have atomic clocks, clocks the time it takes for a signal from your watch or your phone to get up to the satellite and back and that other satellite and back allows you to determine your position [inaudible]. But if the clock is ticking at a rate than you get a wrong answer for the time it takes for it to go on the the, the number you get from that satellite. When it reports to your watch, is it slower, faster? Well, due to there are two effects due to its motion due to its motion. It's, well, how can I say this? It's basically slower, but due to its motion, it's taking it a slower rate. Okay. Due to its height in the gravitational field, it turns out that it's faster. So the two effects counter each other. General relativity in class and specialty J in this case, general relativity winds, I think it's something like, uh, they're, they're ticking more slowly at.

Speaker 1:          01:56:21       I calculated once I wrote a New York Times piece on this and I forget the number, but it's something like, of the order of 38 microseconds per day, they're clicking, they're taking at a slower rate, million, 38 millions of a second every, every day different. And that may not sound important to you, but if you calculate how far light travels in 38 millions of a second, it's pretty far. And so therefore, if you, if you, if you keep getting wrong by that number, your, your determination of your position is going to keep getting wrong by that, by that number. And, and I worked out I, and then this should allow me to work backwards. If I had a pad and paper, um, I see a pad, but I know I'm not going to do it right now because I'm okay, but I remembered you'd be out by something like a kilometer in two minutes.

Speaker 1:          01:57:09       Wow. Isn't that amazing? That is amazing. So we use these abstract esoteric principles and they govern our lives. So general activity really isn't matters for our technology, but it tells us. But what's really interesting, so as objects fall into a black hole, because they're getting stronger and stronger gravitational fields from the outside, we see them moving more and more slowly and eventually we seed them freeze at the surface we will never see from the outside. It will look like it will take an infinite amount of time for an object to fall through the event horizon of a black hole. Even though in its own frame it falls through no problem for us. It will watch it slowly, slowly, slowly because it's clock is literally ticking at a different rate and it will take an infinite amount of time for us, for any object to fall through the event horizon black hole.

Speaker 1:          01:57:54       If we're watching from the outside, that's why the Russians call them frozen stars. Isn't that weird? It's crazy. It is, but it's true. Now, where did the concept come from that inside every black hole is perhaps hundreds of billions of galaxies each with a black hole in front of it. Oh, well I don't. I never heard that concept. What I have heard is that is that at the singularity, the singularity, maybe a portal to another universe, right? And moreover that, that that inside the black hole you could, you could imagine that, that you're observing a space that appears to be expanding instead of contracting. And is it possible that those inside that black hole, that universe would not have the same laws of physics that we. Well, once it goes through the singularity, who knows because the laws of physics breakdown, but one thing I can tell you for sure is there aren't millions of billions of galaxies inside that black hole.

Speaker 1:          01:58:39       And you know why? Because gravity allows us to measure what the total mass of the black hole is for in that sense of black holes it. Well, if it's a portal that's a different universe, right, that's what I'm saying. But after that's when then it's no longer inside the black hole, but it's wonderful that the black holes are just like any other stars, you know, you can rub it around them, you know? Not everything falls into a black hole because if you're far enough away you can just do an orbit like a planet around the sun. The Sun is attracting us, but the earth doesn't fall into it and not in a normal amount of time. Do you anticipate that that's something that we might try to do in the future? Send a satellite into the black hole first we'd have to find a black hole or the one in the center of our galaxy perhaps. Well, that you know how long it takes to get to this end of the golf is 40. The center of our galaxy is 40,000 light years away, so it's a long experiment.

Speaker 1:          01:59:31       Yeah, it's unfortunate. It's not clear to me the national science foundation under trump or anyone else is going gonna Fund that fund that. Yeah. Now what about having a week? I'd be interested if we could send a lot of congress to explore what the what it's like at the center of the black hole. That would be a solution. Maybe suit them all up. Yeah. Sued 'em all up. Go boldly go where no man or woman has gone before. What about black holes that are not attached to galaxies? While we don't see them, we don't. I mean right now we have. I don't believe anyone's because here's how you. How do you see a black hole? You have to see the star circling around. Exactly right. It's the only way you can see that. So those just theoretical. The stars that aren't the black holes rather that aren't attached to.

Speaker 1:          02:00:11       Well, I mean and not only are the theoretical, I think very few people argue there are many such things because we tend to think that stars conglomerated around around regions where there's dominant mass, right? They collapsed and so while it's true that the galaxies are just the tip of a dominant of a cosmic iceberg, most of the massive galaxies isn't stars or black holes. It's this stuff called dark matter. What is that stuff you can see and try to explain it to me and told him, get in there either. Well, it's look, it's really quite simple when we way galaxies, which we can do by seeing how fast the stars move around them, we find out that they weigh a lot more than could be accounted by counting all the stars so the dominant mass doesn't shine. We call that dark matter, not too surprising and what, but what we have discovered, and this is the surprising part, is we can estimate how much normal matter there is and by normal matter I mean the stuff made of protons and neutrons the same as you and me and when we add up how much dark matter we see in the universe.

Speaker 1:          02:01:11       There's a heck of a lot more of that than can be accounted for by the total number of protons and neutrons in the universe. And that means that we think the dark matter is made of some new type of elementary particle. Something that was created in the early history of the universe that's different than normal matter. That's not too surprising either because in the early universe there was lots of energy around and if they're new elementary particles that are stable, it's not too surprising that there are lots of them around and if they don't interact with light, we wouldn't see them. In fact, not only is that reasonable, but we cannot understand how galaxies would form. If it weren't for dark matter. We can do the calculations and show that if it, if the, if there is a dark matter weren't made of stuff that's different than protons and neutrons, there would not have been enough time in the history of the universe for galaxies to form.

Speaker 1:          02:01:59       Therefore, that's really strong evidence that that stuff must be there and it must not be made of protons and neutrons because we're proof. You and I that galaxies formed. It's so fascinating that there's this element that's a huge part of the universe itself. The word, not really exactly sure what it is. Yeah. Isn't that great? It's amazing. It's amazing. There are mysteries. What unfortunately people get told is that it makes it seem like, you know, science was done and it's all done. It was done by dead white men 200 years ago. That's not the mysteries continue. That's why it's the greatest story ever told so far. That's why young kids should be interested in science because life is full of mysteries and we've learned so much about the universe, but it gets more mysterious and more exciting and every time we open a new window on the universe were surprised.

Speaker 1:          02:02:45       That's why we got to keep looking out and not looking in. Tell me about hyper Novas. Hyper Novas. I watched a science documentary freaked me out about how when they first started measuring gamma ray bursts out into the unit. They thought there was wars going on between alien races. Well, the point is that you know how you know there are these things called gamma ray bursts and what they are. Gamma rays are extremely energetic forms of light if you want to think about it, and they're among other things that are admitted in nuclear weapons explosions. Okay. And, and you know how they were discovered. It's really neat. It's one of the few examples of defense money, well spent in my opinion, but maybe not the few, but I now that you'll get lots of eight mil. So we'll like that. Anyway. Um, so there were these satellites that were designed to go up that were earth monitoring to look for gamma rays.

Speaker 1:          02:03:35       Why? Cause we were looking for nuclear weapons explosions to see if the Soviets or some other country where we're having nuclear weapons closer. There's one way to monitor what year was this one? Oh, this was. These satellites were put up in the sixties and seventies. So this is around the time they did that operation starfish prime, where they detonated in new, into the, into the, uh, atmosphere. The magnetosphere probably, I don't know, but I honestly don't know the answer to that question, but, but the point is they were used by the as monitoring systems to look for nuclear weapons explosions. And then these things are sure, looking downward discover these, get these short bursts of gamma rays, which would be a potential signature of nuclear weapons explosions. But they discovered they weren't coming from earth and then they discovered they were coming from everywhere in the cosmos, and that's how they were discovered.

Speaker 1:          02:04:21       These devices, we're monitoring the earth, looking for nuclear weapons explosions, and then saw them out in space. How many of them were well? They're everywhere. There's millions of them and they happen there. One second, two second, one minute long bursts that are incredibly energetic. It meaning more energy than Sun may meet in this lifetime, in its lifetime, and they're happening all the time. They're happening all the time. You know why? Because the great thing about the universities, it's big and it's old and therefore a rare events happen all the time. Let me give you an example. Stars explode and it's good for us. It starts exploding about in this book because it it's it. Because every atom in your body and every atom in my body was made inside stars that eventually explode. Well, how do we know that? Because in the big bang, the only elements that were created were hydrogen, helium, and a little bit of lithium.

Speaker 1:          02:05:09       Okay? But the importance for some people, that seems important, but the rest of us, rest of us, carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, iron, all the stuff that makes us human was only created in the fiery furnaces, in the cores of stars. And how could it get into your and my body? Because there were stars that were kind enough to explode. So as I once said, and some people put on t shirts now, so forget Jesus. The stars died. So we could be born. Okay, but, but here's the deal. Stars explode about once every hundred years per galaxy. So in our galaxy, once every hundred years to stars explodes, there have been about 200 million stars explode in the 14 billion years or 12 billion years since our galaxy has been around. And that's produced the raw materials at four and a half billion years ago, coalesce to form our sun and the planets.

Speaker 1:          02:05:52       And you and I. So all the atoms in your body Balms, restores and been through the most intense explosion that we know of in nature. A supernova and every atom in your body is experiencing maybe more than once. Because to get to the amount of carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, and that's in our bodies, it had to be recycled many times. So the Adams in your left hand may have been inside a different star than your right hand. You're really star dust. We're all stardust where we're really connected the cosmos in really interesting and important ways. We literally were created by stars. That's great thing, but, but, but that's not the point I wanted to make. The point I wanted to make was stars explode once for a hundred years per galaxy. We use supernovae as a way to probe the universe. How can we do that if one, if we're looking at galaxies and one star explodes every hundred years and the galaxy, how can we use them as probes?

Speaker 1:          02:06:41       Well, as I say, there's one way is to sign a graduate student teach galaxy. You know, the phd period can be about a hundred years and if they die, students are cheap. So you get a new one or we use a nomad. This fact that the universe is big and old. If you take your hands up tonight and and we're in Los Angeles where you could see the stars and it held a dime sized, made a dime sized hole, and looked up at a dime size dark region of the universe. You know what? You didn't see any stars. If you had a telescope that as big as the telescope in Chile, you'd see 100,000 galaxies, 100,000 galaxies and that small region. Then if one star explodes every hundred years per galaxy, if you work out, how many stars will I see? Explode tonight? You'll find out. You'll see two or three stars explode just in that dime.

Speaker 1:          02:07:27       Size. Yeah, because the universe is big and old and rare events happen all the time and that's what makes the universe so exciting because now we can use supernova to study the universe because astronomers write proposals and say, tonight, I mean use the Hubble space telescope to look at this region and I'm going to see three stars explode. Wow. Isn't that amazing? That is amazing. Yeah. It's just the. And isn't it a shame that more people don't realize that? Because that's as amazing as you know, as anything. I mean, that's the kind of thing that makes like, oh wow, that's, that's neat. And it's, as I say, it's neat to see a great movie too, but that they're all together. Science is fun and Neat and interesting and you don't have to be a scientist to find it. Amazing. Yeah. That is about as amazing as it gets.

Speaker 1:          02:08:11       I think we don't. We have a real issue. I think with cities were light pollution prevents people from seeing your amazing stars. In fact, there's a lot of astronomers who are, who are doing, in fact I'm active work to try and reduce light pollution in cities near telescopes. And there's other. I mean, the accuracy, but radio telescope is an amazing. If you've never been down to Puerto Rico, it's beautiful. It was actually, you would have seen it in to James Bond movies because they made it into like the layer of, uh, you know, the pictures of it in the layer of, of, of some crazy evil scientists. And I've been there a few times and it's amazing because it's this thousand meter wide net of, of, of, of wires in a, in a natural sort of volcanic volcanic cap account. It's really beautiful. And there's jungle growing underneath it.

Speaker 1:          02:08:56       I'd walked underneath it. And the receivables Pedro scope is amazing because it, it, it because it's so big, it allows us to measure lots of neat things in the universe. In fact, you could measure a light bulb on Pluto if there was a light bulb. You know, we're looking at the picture of it now. It's amazing. It's amazing. And you can't even get the sense of the size of it necessarily from that. It's all wired. So it's all wires. It's not solid. It's wires because it's only measuring radio waves if the wavelength is large compared to the spacing between the wires, you don't need something solid. Right? Okay. So, uh, they were worried. And this is a real example they're looking for, among other things, a frequency of radiation which is ubiquitous in the universe that is emitted by hydrogen. It was the first sort of thing that people used to do, radio, radio astronomy, hydrogen Mitsa a has a characteristic frequency of emission of radio waves due to due to what's called the high performance building and hydrogen and it, it.

Speaker 1:          02:09:49       And so people have said, you know what, that would be a wonderful frequency for, for aliens to commute if they really wanted to show it, if they're smart enough to know that how the universe works. That's a universal frequency. That's everywhere because hydrogen is the dominant kind of matter and it all, it always emits radiation at that frequency. Okay. A thousand 40 megahertz I think is the frequency. Okay. A yellow, again, it could be wrong, but something like that. And uh, but they're worried because there was nearby are stable. There was an evangelist who had a huge radio station and wanted to broadcast to the continental United States is evangelical message and he was going to basically at a frequency that would mean that she couldn't work anymore. Speaking of light pollution, we talked about light pollution. That was radio pollution. And in this case, it was pollution in many ways because everything you said was polluting, but, but, uh, and, and, and finally they managed to be able to fix that, but there would have been one of the most amazing windows on the universe that would have been blocked out by radio light, just like from an evangelists.

Speaker 1:          02:10:55       Yeah. Yeah. That's it, isn't it, isn't it? It's very ironic. It's, I think it's very symbolic of many things. Wow.

Speaker 1:          02:11:04       That is fascinating moment of silence because it's so amazing. Yeah. Well, it's confusing. Well, yeah. But that's okay. Being confused is that I told you being longer. Confused is the best part. No, that I and I can get it. I get it now. Um, when, when you talk about the vastness of space and you talk about space being 14 billion or whatever it is, point 8 billion years old plus or minus a little bit. What's the going theory about what was going on before that? When I wrote a book about it, first of all, but, but, uh, called the universe from nothing. The point is we don't. The simple answer is we don't know because the at the incident of the Big Bang, the whole universe was contained in a region. We'd have to understand gravity is a quantum mechanical forest to really understand what was happening and we don't have a quantum theory of gravity, so it's okay to say we don't know, but we can say what plausibly was the case and one possibility and the possibility that looks most plausible that I talked about is our universe spontaneously came into being from nothing by quantum fluctuations, a space and time that did not exist.

Speaker 1:          02:12:09       So our space and our time didn't exist and there was no matter in the universe and it's suddenly popped into existence and one of the neat things is if you add up the total energy of all the stuff on our universe, it adds up to zero as far as we can tell what? Zero. What does that, how's that? Because it. Because gravity allows things to have positive energy as well as negative energy. You add it all up and our universe looks like in its total energy zero, but I know you're shaking your head, but that's the neat thing is I'm trying to. If you were going to create a universe from nothing, what would you make? The total energy, the total energy thing. Why would you? Once you realize the total energy universe can be zero, then the possibility that it comes from nothing becomes plausible because if it doesn't, you may need to dd to create everything, but it turns out you can create a 100 billion galaxies each containing 100 billion stars without violating energy conservation, and that isn't it.

Speaker 1:          02:13:00       It's the ultimate free lunches Alan guth would say, and it's amazing that that's possible. Now, can we prove that that happened? No, but everything we can point to makes it plausible. In fact, you can ask the following question. What would the universe look like today that was created that that that arose spontaneously from nothing, 13 point 8 billion years ago just by known laws of physics or at least plausible laws of physics. What would it look like today, if that, if that was the requirement and the answer is it will look just like the universe in which we live in that. Does that prove that that's what happened? No, but it makes it plausible and it makes it plausible without supernatural shenanigans and anytime you can get rid of God, it's a good thing, but isn't something out of nothing. Supernatural Shenanigans because it happens all the time.

Speaker 1:          02:13:48       Right? You know, I, I, this is an example I've been talking about to a few times today to people. The lights in the studio, the lights above us, our head. So what happened? So electrons change energy levels and Adams and they emit photons were, were the photons before they were admitted, they weren't in the Adam. Where were they? They didn't. They didn't exist. They were spontaneously graded. They were turned on by the lights switch. No, God, no. They're spontaneously created because there's no cause for any of them to. Each. Adam spontaneously decays into a different level because quantum mechanics says that these things can happen spontaneously. And when it does, a photon is created from nothing. So here's what I was getting at. Yeah. What is the difference between this infinitely dent, small point that the universe came out of and the center of a black hole.

Speaker 1:          02:14:33       The event horizon of a black hole? Well, another event horizon isn't the center. It's the outside of the black hole. The will. The, the answer is there is no different. No different. No, they're singularities where the laws of physics as we know them, break down. Is it possible that inside of each one of those black holes is the birth of the universe maybe? Is that how we were? No, no, I think it's, I think it's more likely to. Quantum mechanics just burped us out per cosmic burp. Much like, you know, I mean I think it's great. I don't know if you saw in my, in my jacket, which I don't know where I put it, but it was probably outside. Uh, I had the flying spaghetti monster because I love this because he boiled so that we could be alive today. But it's, it's, it's, it's, you know, it's just pissing people off me.

Speaker 1:          02:15:22       But. So this infinitely dense point of 13 point 8 billion years ago, this was whatever it was, is this something out of nothing point. What are your thoughts about before that? Well, here's the thing that you're going to hate one possibility, which is quite possible and plausible. If our space suddenly popped out or nothing. Einstein tells us that space and time are together. We live in a four dimension universe. So space began at that instance sort of time. So there was no before the question isn't a good question. Tom didn't exist to the universe came into existence. So to ask the question, what was before is not a good question. So time didn't exist before 13 point 8 billion years. It could be that if our university is all there is and that we happen to think by the way is not likely. But if it is then it doesn't make sense to ask the question what was before because Tom didn't exist.

Speaker 1:          02:16:14       It sounds like a cop out and it Kinda is, but it may also be true. So. And if there's no before then all of our notions of causality go out the window because we all depend on but before and after to decide causes and effects. But if there was no before, then we have to change our notions of a cause and, and that's awful. But Hey, that's what we call learning. What about the idea is that the universe is in a constant state of contraction? No, it isn't. And well, I mean some people think that no, it's not been abandoned. Some physicists will argue that there's a cycle because it looks nice and they aren't. I think most of most people, I mean there's some people who are arguing for that pitch something neat. Well, I think they're trying to type their ignorance in something that isn't any more plausible than the picture that expands forever.

Speaker 1:          02:16:56       And as far as we can tell, the most likely possibilities that our university will expand forever fought to make you a little bit happier. It's quite possible. The best pictures that we have of our, of, of, of the early years is that we actually are universities. Unique isn't alone, that there are many universes, we call it a multiverse and that at any instant in time and kind of a cosmic super time, there's always university being born so that that multi-verse might be, might be infinite and eternal. Where are they outside of our universe? Oh, how's that? Even possible. How? Of course it's possible. I understand. Okay. No, no. Well, first of all, the simplest possibility is that there outside the region we can see right for, for, for example, the edges of our visible universe space is expanding faster away from us than light because you know, we taught you in school.

Speaker 1:          02:17:47       Nothing can travel faster than light and you may remember that we lied. Oh, okay. Well No, you have to parse it more carefully. Like a lawyer. Nothing can travel through space faster than light, but space can do whatever the hell it wants. So locally, as I told you though, radio host is, is at rest, they're not moving and the other end of the galaxy at the other end of the visible universe and we're at rest, but the space between us is expanding. So that galaxy, like a surfer is being carried away from us faster than light relative to the water. The surfer isn't moving right, but relative to the shore, the surfer is right, right. Okay. So this, this galaxy is not moving relative to its local surroundings, but it's moving away from us faster than light. And like a surfer in an undertow, they can swim really fast in the water, but if the water's moving away from the shore, they'll let me take it back to the shore.

Speaker 1:          02:18:38       Right. And so that galaxy, the light from that galaxy is traveling through space at the speed of light, but it's the space in between us and the galaxies moving faster than light. Then the poor like can never make it to us. We call that a horizon. Wow. So the space is traveling too far for the light to reach us so fast. The two spaces too fast. So the light can't catch up with the expansion of space and it never gets to us and that that galaxy disappears from our causal horizon. We call it will never be able to see. It will never be able to interact with, it will never be okay and it could be that that there are different regions so far away from us. We're space is expanding faster than light, which which have a very different history than our own, so there could be space, could be infinite, just our simple unit space that we know of and love could be infinite in extent and different regions of that space had different histories and some of those regions.

Speaker 1:          02:19:38       Everything we can see we know emerged from a single point. Okay, we can tell that. We can tell that by measuring the big bang expansion of everything we see and working backwards and the university that our visible universe was once smaller and smaller and smaller. If you go back in time, we can actually follow the laws of physics back to the earliest moments of the big bang until those laws break down and we can make predictions about the university would look like. All those predictions agree exactly what the observations we make, which tell us that that picture works, but another region, if you wish, could have come from a different big bang, but is that another universe or is it a part of the university? We see, here's how we've changed and this is semantics, but nontrivial semantics, namely when I was a kid, universe meant everything.

Speaker 1:          02:20:19       Everything right, but we say that's it's pretty stupid definition. A better definition is an operational one. Universe means that region of space with which at one time we could have communicated or one time in the future even if the future is infinite, we might communicate with because that describes the region of space we're causing effect works some measurable distance. Yes, and so that art we think of the universe is that region which could throughout which everything could affect everything else ultimately in an infinitely long time and in that picture, universes can be restricted in size and then other regions which could never have affected us and which will never affect us in the future. We call other universes a and when and now there are many different versions of a multiverse, but that's the simplest version. And this picture we call inflation, which, uh, you know, I talk, I just did two little clips associated with the new book, one for us for a publisher and one was for big think one is a, the universe and under two minutes so you can look up online, looked for Lawrence Krauss, explains the universe in under two minutes where I talk about this cosmic expansion and how it might mean there's a multiverse, but the other is, um, explain the universe in terms of this beer bottle that I talked about you earlier.

Speaker 1:          02:21:37       So you can, that's a video. You can watch that. But at this theory of inflation, which actually says our universal, the qual, the qualities that we see of our universe can best be explained if some early time in the history of the universe when it was a billionth of a billionth of a billionth, of a billionth of a second old. It had a huge expansion suddenly and increased in size by 30 orders of magnitude in size. In a billionth of a billionth of a billionth, of a billionth of a second, which is by the way particle physics suggests is highly plausible even though, okay, and then and then, and then it would produce a universe that looks more or less like we look like you look like and, and uh, and it's right now the only explanation of how that would cause the university to look like, what it looks like.

Speaker 1:          02:22:22       But the neat thing about inflation is it's eternal. So inflation that puffing up ended in our universe. And then boom, a hot, big bang followed it. Okay. So the region, the universe universe puffed up by huge amount than all of that energy which was stored and empty space got released like the beer bottle and we got a hot, big bang and the rest is history, but that's locally, but somewhere else between us and their space is still expanding exponentially and faster and faster and faster. And only maybe somewhere else today. Boom. Like an ice crystal forming boom. That that region of space is suddenly left inflation and maybe a guilt a gazillion years in the future, there'll be another region of space that's expanding away from it, so much faster than light. So we'll never know about it where suddenly that region leads inflation and boom, another hot big bang happens and it turns out in each of those hot big bangs, after the inflation ends, depending upon how it ends, the laws of physics could be different in that universe. And that's what we tend to think. It's quite likely that there are many, many separate regions of space and in fact it's eternal. So such regions are forming eternally for all time and, and, and there are hot, big bangs happening in many regions and the properties of each of those regions, whether they're conducive to forming galaxies and stars and planets and people may be different. So we could say logically in that picture that the reason the universe looks like the way it does is because we're here to measure it.

Speaker 3:          02:23:53       Oh my God, we should leave it at that. Okay. We should close with that. That is the mindblower wind blowers. Wow, I'm glad I wore you out. Not the other way around. Was amazing. Thank you so much. Fun fact mandated. Again, that's two and a half hours, man. Just by good. Thanks. Wow. Thank you for you and me and my have flown by. I don't know how the little strip. Listen man, that that was a mindblower. Okay. Thank greatest story ever told so far. It's available now. You can get it an audio books. It's on a. You can get it on itunes and an audio book form as well. Thank you very much. Really, really appreciate it. It's been great to finally get to talk to you. I really appreciate this. Thank you.
