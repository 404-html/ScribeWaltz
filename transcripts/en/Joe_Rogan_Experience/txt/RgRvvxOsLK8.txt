Speaker 1:          00:01          Hello Freak bitches. Satisfying. I was in Vegas and I was sober and I ran into this chick that I know you used to be a ring card girl and she was super, super drunk. Sloppy. You're sober and so when else is not, and you're like, hey, how are you doing? How are you? And they just like, oh yeah. By the way, if you see people outside of a pink Floyd concert that you know, please don't assume that they're just fine. You know? Don't just say, hey man, I haven't seen you in awhile. Just fucking say hi and walk away. Fuck Golan. Yeah, no, please. What happened? Which was people saying hi, but it's like, I don't, I can't talk to you right now. Going to be cool. I thought you ran into somebody they know. Fucking hippie. Yeah. It's a very embarrassing thing when you're intoxicated and the other person isn't. Yeah. You feel like it's a hassle. It's such a loser. Whether I'm drunk or whether I'm stoned, I always feel like a real idiot if I'm drunk or coked up, I feel like an idiot. Yeah. If I'm stolen, I feel baffled. You have the person.
