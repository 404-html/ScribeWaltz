Speaker 1:          00:00:00       I could keep it in check for three, two, and we're live. First of all, Steve, thank you very much for doing this. I really appreciate it. Oh, thank you for having me. I've been a big fan of your work for a long time and um, you, you bring up some really fascinating subjects and we were talking right before the podcast about social media and how weird it is that you got lumped in with the outright for a comment saying something along the lines of that you find what was the exact quote something along the highly intelligent people seem to, which is not saying they're good people.

Speaker 2:          00:00:37       No, that's right. And I think a lot of people who are ignorant to the outright equate them with a, uh, the skinheads and the Neo Nazis carrying the Tiki torches. But when I was referring strictly to the outright from its origin in internet discussion groups and I, you know, I, I know some of them, some of them are former students and some of them are highly intelligent and highly read. So, uh, but, but that's not what people often think of when they think of the alt right. And that's what I was referring to. I certainly, there are people in tech, there's some people in universities is stay under cover. And uh, I was, uh, made some remarks on how to starve that movement, not how to feed it, but

Speaker 1:          00:01:15       so many people jumped on it as if you were endorsing the alt right. It was the exact quote you were just basically saying something along the lines of there's a lot of intelligent people that are involved in this.

Speaker 2:          00:01:26       Well, it wasn't so much that it was also that because of the, uh, uh, the various taboos in mainstream intellectual culture because of political correctness, there's certain things that are just kind of not discussable, but then when people in the outright discover them, they feel tremendously empowered. Like we are now privy to the truth that the establishment can't handle. You can't handle the truth. And since it was never discussed in the open, there are no counterarguments to some of the most toxic interpretations. And so the outright can run with the never having been in a forum where these things that are debated and criticized and put it into context, they take like one fact and then they draw the most extreme conclusions. If these things were debated in the first place, then you'd realize that those conclusions are not warranted. Oh, it's. I mean an example is there are average differences between men and women and a lot of psychological traits now if that's.

Speaker 2:          00:02:19       And that's often quite taboo in intellectual circles for I think bizarre reasons. So I had to get people who think that somehow women's rights depend on men and women being indistinguishable. I think it's a bad equation in the first place, but as soon as you come across the fact that men and women on average are, are different. You also come across the fact that men and women overlap in a lot of these traits that whatever trait you name, that men on average are better at that women or vice versa. There are a lot of women who are better than a lot of men or vice versa, and so you can't really judge an individual from the average of, uh, their, their, their sex. Also, even though there are some traits where men score a little better than women, there some traits were women score a little better than men and that that's the complete picture. But the thing is that if the entire subject is out of bounds, you never get to present the complete picture. And some people run away with all men and women are totally different. What are your thoughts on how the subject got out of bounds?

Speaker 1:          00:03:16       Because it's very confusing to me that certain subjects like the differences between genders are so taboo when they seem so obvious. I mean, you just could go to a mall and just look at the way the men dress and the women dress and you go, well, there's some obvious distinctions here.

Speaker 2:          00:03:34       There's a history to it because there were, there were a lot of khaki, maybe theories and the 19th century, and in a lot of the 20th century that men were intellectual and women were not in. Women were governed by their emotions and their women thought too much. It would take blood away from their ovaries and their womb and they wouldn't be fertile and then they'd be all miserable. I mean really like crazy stuff. And as a reaction to that, in the seventies when the second wave of feminism became prominent, it became almost an article of faith that there were no differences between men and women. Uh, and so if you say that there are differences between men and women, you're sending women back to the, to the kitchen in the nursery. So this is a total non sequitur because fairness is not the same as sameness.

Speaker 2:          00:04:18       So obviously women should have equal rights to men, whether or not they're exact copies of men or have a distinctive profile as men have a distinct profile. So I think it's just a mistake to, uh, to conflate the issue of women's rights with men and women being identical, but that's the way it kind of shook out and it became kind of an article of faith in a, in a lot of, in some feminist, some kind of left liberal circles that men and women have to be identical. And if they aren't, that means you're a trader you to, to a women's equality.

Speaker 1:          00:04:49       Yeah. And the articles of faith are always dangerous. Dangerous, especially in that regard. It's articles of fairness are always important. I mean, fair being fair to each other and being fair is also recognizing differences.

Speaker 2:          00:05:00       That's right. And not assuming that any differences a deficiency, if you're really doing an honest comparison of the differences between men and women, men wouldn't come out looking so good.

Speaker 1:          00:05:11       Right? No. Yeah. I have a whole bit about that in my act when we're looking at the reaction to this though. What was strange to me was how many people seemed like they wanted to jump on board and criticize you. And I think a lot of it is almost like to take away some of the potential criticism of themselves, like it's instant claiming of the moral high ground virtue signaling and it's just very disappointing when you see this from intellectuals and college professors and it should know better. I

Speaker 2:          00:05:41       mean, to be fair, I did not get into much trouble from, from, you know, my peers and among the professors and Grad students and so on. There are a couple of trolls who, uh, who, who ran with it, but by and large, the mainstream reaction was, this is almost a sign of a, as a New York Times put it, that social is made

Speaker 1:          00:05:57       stupid. Yeah. That was the article, the name of the title of the article and the time.

Speaker 2:          00:06:01       Yeah. So it was by and large, uh, you know, I came out of it. Okay. But it was a real indication of how these mobs of outrage can corrupt any kind of intelligence

Speaker 1:          00:06:11       discourse. Yeah. Well, subtle discussions, the discussions that involve nuanced, complicated issues that are there. They're complex. They require a long dis sort of description of the issue. And I'll, I'll a very complex sort of take on these various differences between men and women and the alt right and the left and political director. These are, these are long discussions. I mean these aren't something that you can smash into a very short sound soundbite and completely cover your take on things

Speaker 2:          00:06:47       hold the more reason that they shouldn't be taboo because if you can't discuss them then the only interpretation you're going to have as the simplistic one. If you could bring them out in the open, then you can start to have that discussion.

Speaker 1:          00:06:57       Yeah. I'm hoping that this is turning around. I'm hoping that what's happened is the outrage culture, the outrage culture has become almost a parody of itself has gotten so ridiculous that people will sort of shy away from outrage seemingly like the same reason why people are terrified of talking about the differences between men and women is because they don't want to be grouped into the people that literally are legitimately rather were sexist in the, the, you know, the 19 hundreds and the 18 hundreds. And these people that did have these terrible ideas. So now we're trying to go so far away from that that we've become a little bit ridiculous and I'm hoping things, I'm hoping it's a swing and they'll just kind of bounce back towards the middle again.

Speaker 2:          00:07:43       Yeah. And in fact, there is some hope that that would. Eddie medium is new, there'll be these excesses and it takes awhile for the system to kind of re re equilibrate to have an immune response that damps down the worst of it. I mean, I've been on the Internet a long time and in the eighties when it was mainly academics and computer scientists who are on the Internet, there are these discussion groups. This was before the worldwide web, so it was all text and there's this concept of, of flaming. Yeah. I don't know if the word is all days. Well, it came from the, uh, there was an award given a jokey award called it the flaming asshole award. Oh really? And the, the, uh, to the, the, the, the worst insult or in these intellectual discussions. And the, the uh, uh, the, the trophy was supposedly his bestest cork, but from the flaming asshole award there was the, the, the, the flame, the adjective flame wars, the verb to flame dam down. As people became aware of flaming as a phenomenon in the discussion groups, it was, well, let's not turn this into a flame war or in flames. And when people realized that this was a thing,

Speaker 3:          00:08:56       then they could push back against it. And let's hope that that happens with this social media again. Yeah, I hope so. It was a sport in like the late nineties, early two thousands. It was essentially like an online support. Like someone would say something about you and you'd go, Oh crap. And how do I attack this? And it was, it was more fun than anything. And I felt like there was very few people relatively speaking, involved in discussion groups back then in terms of like the mass amount of people that are on social media now. It's certainly like everyone is in some form of, or most people are in some form of social media now. Whereas back then, the number of people that were on message boards was so small. Yeah. So smell. That's right. And you're right there. There is an art form of ritual insults in Shakespeare and you know, African American snapping a there when people realize that this is a sport that no one gets hurt.

Speaker 3:          00:09:48       It's just like, you know, right. It's like martial arts, it's part of the fun. But the thing is that when it goes out of control and it really does attack people's reputations and then you've got a problem. We have a thing in comedy called roast battle. Yeah. Roasting another example. Yeah, absolutely. And Roast battle is this, uh, this great show that they do at the comedy store. Every Tuesday we're, comedians will prepare insults against each other. But my friend Brian Moses who hosts it at the end of everything, they always hug it out, right? Like, it's always like, no, this is a joke, writing exercise and a fun joke writing show and no one really, no one means any of this and not really mean. It hugs me, just like a, like a professional boxing or ultimate fighting yourself. So whatever you can, there are rules, there's an arena and when you're done, it's over.

Speaker 3:          00:10:39       You don't plot revenge, but sometimes people can misunderstand it. There's that famous press roast where a Obama had some fun at the expense of Donald trump when he was still just a a, a reality show and you could see famously the camera zoomed in on trump and he was not abused at jokes, at his expense. And there's, there's a theory that one of the reasons that he plotted his presidential run was to, was to get revenge. Well, that's one of the things that Obama said during that roast, and here's one of the things that I am that you'll never be president of the United States and crazy and cheered on history. We could have turned out very differently if he hadn't made that one joke. It's amazing, isn't it? Well, yeah. Apparently he had been thinking about being president for a long, long time, but that might, might have been the straw that broke the camel's back. So Barack, what have you done when you see social media today, like as a psychologist and you see this thing that people do when they can behave anonymously in the absence of social cues, not in front of each other, not, not seeing that. How the cruel things hurt each other. How does that make you do? Do you think that this is just an unnatural

Speaker 1:          00:11:54       way of communicating?

Speaker 2:          00:11:55       Well, there is something. The anonymity is certainly a natural and relaxed face to face contact. And I think one of the big discoveries of psychology from over the last couple of decades is that we're moral animals to the extent that we have reputations. Uh, going, going back to Richard Dawkins, his famous book, the selfish gene where he posed the question, how could niceness in generosity and cooperation evolve given that in Darwinian competition you'd expect the most aggressive, the most selfish to predominate. And there's an answer to that question in Docklands, worked it out back in 1976 based on work of other biologists, which is, if there is reciprocity, that is, if I, I remember the nice things that you did to me and I feel compelled to, uh, to, to repay them. And conversely, if you do something that harms me and I threatened revenge, then people can kind of settle into cooperation because we really are better off if we extend favorites to each other that, uh, do a lot of good to the other in response to a fairly minor inconvenience to the self.

Speaker 2:          00:13:02       If everyone does that, everyone is better off. And that's only stable though if everyone has a memory for what everyone else did. Therefore that sets up a pressure to cultivate your reputation as someone who is trustworthy and will reciprocate at, but without the reputation, without the memory of who did what. And uh, and how generous and trustworthy someone is. The whole thing can unravel when you get back to what people think of as Darwinian competition. Namely nature, red in tooth and claw. Just a bloody battle. So reputation is really, it's not just a matter of kind of ego or burnishing your credentials, that's really what makes all cooperation, niceness kindness a possible. And so when you have an arena in which the, uh, first of all you don't have face to face contact so you don't have the kind of evolved responses that we have to, to getting along a namely it's a, it's a big deal to a insult someone to their, their, their face. Some people do it, but, uh, you got to do it very carefully. You take that away and it just, you know, typing a bunch of characters at a keyboard and especially if the person doing the typing has a handle, they just anonymous then that kind of eliminate some of the constraints on civility and generosity and then maintaining a reputation as a credible cooperator.

Speaker 1:          00:14:23       I also feel that there's a, there's a selfishness and being nice and being generous because, uh, the way I describe what I think it feels good, it feels good to be nice, to be bold. It feels good to be generous when you give someone a nice tip at a restaurant and they get happy, like that feels good. Like it's good for you too. It's not just a one way street. What

Speaker 2:          00:14:45       kind of a benign selfishness? Yeah, it's the kind that is, although it's not, uh, the, the, the irony is said it can't just really be calculated if it's really that I just do exactly as much. That gets me gratitude and recognition. Then, you know, other people see through that. And so the, I, the, the, the paradox is that it's kind of got to be sincere for it to be credible to someone else for the most effective way to prove to someone else that you're a nice guy is to actually be a nice guy because if you're just calculating, if you're just doing the bare minimum, you can get away with. Then since we're, we're pretty good. We're all pretty good. Intuitive psychologists were always kind of thing. Did he really mean it? Is he just kind of kissing up? Is he trying to get, you know, curry favors and we see through that.

Speaker 2:          00:15:29       That's the person who actually isn't doing that calculation, but we really admire and respect. Right? And it's very unusual. It's one of the reasons why we admire, like look at this completely altruistic person. Like, I mean, it's clearly remarket the marketplace, have reputations, kind of selects, can select for true niceness. Goodness. Yeah. You've got enough information and enough interactions. I mean, here's a crude analogy. Um, so in the business world, uh, you know, you can have cutthroat fly by night businesses. They just try to squeeze everything out of the customers and then take off the students. The cheating is discovered, you know, they don't last very long. They don't actually make a lot of money. It's often the companies that will take back the product, no questions asked, even if they lose a little bit of money, but they earned the loyalty of their customers.

Speaker 2:          00:16:17       Those are the companies that often do the best and stick around the longest. It's kind of an analogy to the way that being honorable, even if you have little losses. Well, I did a little bit more for him than he did for me, but over the long run, that's what makes you desirable as someone who other people want to hang out with. If the reputations can spread. Yeah. It's kind of amazing. If you think about how cherished true generosity and kindness out cherished they are, like it's a, it's an amazing thing. Like you see people that are truly kind and truly generous and we've, we value that so much. It's kind of amazing. There aren't more of them because it's such a virtue that we admire and you, you, if someone does behave in that manner, like people gravitate towards them. It's like it's a real trait that is attractive to people.

Speaker 2:          00:17:07       It is. And there's a, you know, there's a misunderstanding of the evolutionary explanation of the, uh, of appearance, of altruism and generosity. I had a misunderstanding of, of, uh, the message that Dawkins conveyed in that book that it predicts that we're all just kind of calculating a favorite traders that we do just enough to, uh, get a favor in return. And if we don't think someone could help us in return, then we just cut them off. Kind of a cynical view of generosity. But it's actually the reason that that's not true is that as soon as the game begins, uh, you kind of get to higher and higher levels of eat. People psyching each other out, seeing through them because it's, if I have a choice between who I'm going to hang out with, who's calling to be friend, there's one person who's going to do exactly for what, for me, what will help him in the long run.

Speaker 2:          00:17:56       There's someone else who's really is generous and he's really going to help me. And he said he's not going to keep a long memory of who did what for whom. Well, I'm going to pick the second guy and so he's going to actually be better off for being the better person. Now that you can take that to an extreme and it means that we're all infinitely generous, which of course we're not a. and so there's kind of a tradeoff in equilibrium between, you know, not being a total sucker or not giving so much away that you just harm yourself in the long run and being the kind of person who is generous and honest enough that other people want to affiliate with them. And the reality is that all of us are probably mixtures. I mean, we're not cutthroat sociopath's. Most of us have, some of us are a nora. We are totally a sane self sacrificing saints. We're somewhere in between and different people are at different points in that continuum.

Speaker 1:          00:18:49       When you look at social media and you look at this, uh, this, the, the nastiness that's so common, um, and obviously in some ways it's got to be connected to the ability to be anonymous. But I feel like I've thought of this more and more lately that this negativity is as probably a temporary thing. I feel like people are realizing that this isn't an unnatural way of communicating and that it's so relative, really relatively recent in human history and such a small window. I mean 19, 94 is essentially when people started getting online and here we are in 2018 and you're seeing people switching to flip phones, deleting their facebook. It's a very common thing and almost a chic thing to do, like people were talking about it on a regular basis. All Man. I. Yeah, I just get email. I check it once a day and that's it.

Speaker 2:          00:19:42       Yeah. No, I think that's right. We're there. Whenever there's a new technological innovation, it takes society awhile to adjust to it and say people got online in 1994 with social media or even more recent than that. It's more probably like smartphones started to become ubiquitous around maybe 2011 and facebook took off in the two thousands, but yeah, I think that's right and similar things happened in when other media were introduced. There was a big panic when television came in that families would never talk to each other, they'd all be staring at the screen like zombies and you'd never have a conversation over the dinner table ever again. Even before that, when telephones were invented, it was, you know, families who'd never a sit down together because the phone constantly be ringing in attention spans would be disrupted because the phone could ring anytime. Was there similar conversation about books? Actually there was, yeah. And about writing, going back to the ancient Greeks, uh, who were, uh, when, when writing was considered to be kind of um, uh, you know, degenerate and decadent because you know, you, you'd let your memory go to pot to know how are people to cultivate their memory. They could just write things down and look at them.

Speaker 1:          00:20:49       That's crazy. Is that interesting? Why do you think we were always looking to dismiss some new fantastic technology?

Speaker 2:          00:20:57       It's partly because we don't understand it yet. I mean it's new and also a lot of the adjustments that you were just talking about, you know, you can't really predict them beforehand. A lot of what happens in a society is there like hundreds of little adjustments that people make. Not Spend too much time on facebook or email and leave this platform for that platform where if you were starting from scratch and asked to kind of imagine how it's going to play out, you can't really anticipate these things. Uh, it's like thousands of adjustments that people make. They happen when they happen with billions of people making decisions. Uh, but you, you can't just deduce them beforehand, like a logical proof. And so we just don't know. We know what the threat is. We don't know what society's responsibility.

Speaker 1:          00:21:44       Maybe whether this a fascinating time when it comes to social media and just human interaction because this is so new. And because it's uncharted territory. I mean, I think this is one of the reasons why so many people have so many concerns about it. They're like, where's this? Where's this going? What's it gonna do to our children? We walked down the street and everyone's just staring at their phone. Really is I, I've said this, that imagine if there was a drug that came along that this drug made you only think about the drug. You were, uh, you were likely more likely to get into car accidents because this drug, you're more likely to sleep late, cause more anxiety and, and soak up immense amounts of your time with very little reward for it. You would go, wow. What kind of crazy drugs this, it's robbing people of their lives. Well, that's cell phones, that's social media. I mean it does give you something. I mean if you use it correctly. Most of the time I try to spend on social media. I try to spend or most of the time on, on my phone I try to spend off social media, but reading things like tried to read articles and I try to, I try to in some way justify like, oh, I'm doing something productive on my phone. But a lot of ways I'm just addicted to checking that thing. Yeah,

Speaker 2:          00:22:53       you got, you have to develop habits of self control and balancing life. I had a student, so I teach at Harvard and what time of freshmen came into my office beginning of the semester, so she looked at the shelf of books that she really said, wow, professor pinker, how do you find time to write so many books, and then she looks at my office and sees all the books on my shelves. Wow. Professor Pinker, how do you have time to read so many books? And she paused for a second. He said, I bet you're not on facebook, but this got to be some good that comes out of those communities as well throughout the baby with the bathwater, undoubtedly. Yeah, absolutely. And you know, I confess I'm on twitter. I sometimes look at my twitter feed and I learned really interesting stuff from it, but I also say, okay, enough, get back to work, get back to reading, go outside. See some friends, spent some time with, with uh, with your family.

Speaker 3:          00:23:46       Yeah. I will go down twitter hall. I went down to twitter whole yesterday about these Mont New Mayan Ruins that they found in Guatemala who amazing, crazy thousands of structures swallowed up by time. And they're just now realizing like, oh my God, this was a city. So that stuff's good. Yeah, no, absolutely man. It's a question of are all finding the balance between getting the advantages or disadvantages? Well, it's just so new. Yeah. When, when you see all so much negativity though, and this is a big problem with anonymous accounts in particular, you see it in facebook, in facebook, there seems to be repercussions. Like if you're Tom Smith and Tom Smith writes something horrible, like Tom Smith could get fired from his job for it. We've seen that people will write something racist or sexist or whatever and we'll see them get fired from their job because of something that they put on facebook.

Speaker 3:          00:24:38       Because your profile represents the actual you. It's not anonymous. Yes. I feel like there's benefit to that. Yeah, that's right. There's some. I mean the problem is that can also be outraged. Bob's where someone will post something and it's taken out of context and made me realize what they've entered as a joke. Like the woman who went to, took that trip to Africa Qa, kind of a self effacing comment about racism and people thought it was racist, but she was actually making fun of races. I think she was drunk and she was being racist. I just thought she was being funny because Kummete look, I'm a comic and I have a lot of comedian friends that are not racist, but they will say hilarious racist things. Right. Because it's funny. It's not because they're racist, but. What was her name? Justine Sacco. Thank you. This was the uh, I hope I don't get aids, but a lol.

Speaker 3:          00:25:29       That's what she wrote. She woke up 12 hours later after a Xanex and wine hangover, I'm sure. And her life was a living hell. Yeah. I mean, and she still to this day is, I mean Jamie knows her name is not racist. It ironically she meant it. She herself was not racist and she become controversial after that as well. She was like the PR person for draftkings or fanduel or stuff when they were going through some issues a couple of years ago. Draft kings is an online gambling thing. It's kind of controversial. Gambling on sports and stuff like that. Yeah. I just, we look for people to also, we were talking about this before without getting into details about who we're talking about, but there are certain people that are very flawed individuals that looked to find people and attack them to take away some of the spotlight on their own flaws. Absolutely. This is a thing. This is a big part of virtue signaling, right? Like a big part of, uh, going after people and outrage mobs, as long as the mob is attacking someone else, they're not attacking you. That's right. Yeah, that's right. And there is, I mean, it is a interesting question over a history is how do, how do some of these things called extraordinarily extraordinary popular delusions and the madness

Speaker 2:          00:26:44       of crowds to Tulip Bulb Mania in Holland in the 17th century. It's that, oh, there's a, this, this kind of bubble where people started to outbid each other on tulip bulbs and the, you know, the price of a single tulip bulb went like through the roof and then it's suddenly crashed. People lost fortunes because everyone was expecting everyone else to keep bidding up the price, but there, oh yeah, the tulip bulbs, Tulip Bulb mania, nutty, but then they're also witch hunts where when a woman would be accused of sinking a ship or causing a crop failure or making someone's child gets sick, they're the pogroms in Europe where Jews were accused of poisoning the wells are killing Christian voice to make Mozzarella their blood. Where the lynchings in the, uh, American south where African Americans were accused of raping a woman and I are based on just a rumor spreading and they'd be tortured and hanged.

Speaker 2:          00:27:42       There's the McCarthy era. There were, uh, there's the, the, the daycare, satanic ritual abuse. Amenia of the 19 eighties were these daycare workers were accused basically by coaching kids to embellish these fantastic stories of how they were sexually molested and tortured and forced to take part in satanic rituals mean all totally nonsense. And people went to jail. So initially the question is how do people kind of lose their collective minds in every once in awhile in history? And a part of the answer is if you start a, a kind of vicious circle of denouncing people and then denouncing people who don't denounce people denouncing people who call the whistle on a and other people denouncing people, then you can get a kind of circle of terror where no one wants. Everyone is so afraid of being denounced that they wanted to announce first Stalinist Soviet Union as another example at Mao's, China.

Speaker 2:          00:28:42       And that's somehow some, one of the ways in which dictators could often, uh, enforce their power by turning the citizens against each other. So everyone's denouncing everyone else out of fear that they'll be announced first that's going on right now in North Korea, right? Absolutely. Yeah. Yeah. North Korea, they have this thing where they each have to report on each other. Like when people are together, they report on each other for different things that they did that were violations of whatever code that they follow. Absolutely. And so governments know how to explain it, but it isn't just governments that can happen spontaneously too. It's a weird human trait, isn't it? It is. It's a combination of a kind of a human trait and a kind of dynamic when you have a kind of a network of people, uh, and, and they all are kind of trapped and no one can be the first person to escape from this vicious circle because they don't want to be the one who is denounced it, imprisoned and tortured or whatever. The consequences may be a, what do you think? Where do you think, if you think at all about this, where do you think this is all headed? Like it, especially

Speaker 1:          00:29:42       in terms of social media and.

Speaker 2:          00:29:43       Yes, it's hard to tell, but I, you, you mentioned the possibility that there's been such a growing recognition of the problem that we will mount a response that it'll just seem ridiculous of the outrage mob once it's recognized that there are outraged mobs and virtual signaling fanatics. Once we have a label for them. Once we know that it's a thing, a, it'll seem so ridiculous that people will be less tempted to do it. I mean, that's the optimistic of a outcome.

Speaker 1:          00:30:12       Well, there's just such a flaw in there. There's a real issue in writing things and one of the issues, especially if you're writing about a subject where there's a lot of people involved or perhaps an even an individual, is that you're the only one that's writing. Like if you were having a conversation with that person, they would be able to say something back. You'd be able to say something and they will go, well that's not exactly how I was thinking. Actually. I was looking at it this way and the other person would go, oh, okay, so your take on it was, you know, and they would go back and forth and exchange information. Hopefully come to some sort of an understanding of what's going on in each person's mind. Absolutely. Whereas you can define someone in a tweet or a facebook post or a blog post. You can define someone without them having any ability to respond in the moment. So you have this whole uninterrupted chunk where you could talk about, you know, fill in the blank, some celebrity or some politician or whatever and you can define them and some really horrible, nasty way and they just have to sit there and read it. Like it is just your thoughts. But that's not an accurate method of communicating ideas with a person. It's just your one uninterrupted take on things.

Speaker 2:          00:31:28       Absolutely. So I, my, my second to last book, the one just before my current book enlightenment now, but the previous book was called the sense of style. It was a writing manual way began. Began. It is. I said, why is so much writing so bad? How come there's so much writing where you just can't understand what the person is talking about. And I mentioned some theories. Some people think that it's academics and intellectuals trying to show off how profound they are. My how incomprehensible they are. Like if people could understand it, it can't be that complicated. So I ended up right. The stuff that no one will understand that nothing. I'm really smart. So that's one theory and you know, there might be some truth to it, but I think that the main theory is that that writing is, as you just as you described it, it's a one way channel of communication.

Speaker 2:          00:32:12       It's very unnatural. You know, when we speak, you and I were having a conversation, we're looking at each other in the eye and our eyebrows go up and they get needed and if I say, if I start to become too obscure, you're going to give me a quizzical look. Terrified expression on their face where you can interact and say, well, what the hell was that? When you're writing, you have none of that. And so I think part of the skill in writing what I least, what I argue in the of style is to become a kind of enough of an intuitive psychologists that you can try to anticipate what your reader knows and what your reader doesn't know and that because you have no way of determining that as you're writing because you're just sitting there tapping away whoever was going to read what you write there.

Speaker 2:          00:32:56       You never get to meet them. It might be, you know, three years from now they might be halfway across the world and it's just one way and so, and there's another kind of psychological problem that we all have. It's just part of being human called the curse of knowledge. Namely when you know something, it's really, really hard to imagine what it's like not to know it. You just assume that everyone knows it, the, your, your, your understanding is everyone's understanding and so you right away, you know, write. Right, right, right, right. And it never occurs to you that the reader doesn't know your abbreviations or your jargon or can't visualize what you're describing. It's so clear to you, the writer and a lot of bad writing comes from the curse of knowledge that is a writer not getting into the heads of his reader and a lot of the cure is either to at least at least know that it's a problem and think of what can I read it would be reasonably expected to know because we're not even that good at that.

Speaker 2:          00:33:53       I mean, none of us remind readers, just showing someone a draft of what you've written and you're often surprised at how often they'll say, I don't know what you're talking about. Maybe that's what we should force people to do at twitter. Maybe we should have like a team of people that you send your tweet to a circle of confidence. Well, that, I mean, that's the way it works in publishing. You know, you got, you have an editor in academia, you got peer review before it's published. They send it out to other people just like you and they, they, they write a little review and you've got to modify it if it doesn't make any sense. Right? So Justine Sacco had sent that to a team of confidence they would went. No, don't write that. I'm sorry, I'm on a plane. I'm drunk. I'll call you from Africa.

Speaker 2:          00:34:35       Well, this is, you know, what are the big themes in my new book enlightenment now is, um, how is it that we're simultaneously in many ways getting smarter but also seem to be getting stupider society. So I think part of it is that none of us is individually are that smart. Uh, we all and, and cognitive psychologists have shown that humans have all kinds of biases and fallacies. We, um, we, we rezoned from stereotypes. We assess risk by how easy it is to imagine something. Uh, so, you know, we're afraid of getting on a plane because it's very easy to imagine a plane crashing and plane crashes, make the news. We don't worry about texting while driving because there's never a headline on page one of the hundred people who died in the past week because they texted while driving a certainly a lot of fallacies. So, but the thing is, we, as a species, they've done some amazing things.

Speaker 2:          00:35:30       I mean, we discovered those Mayan, a buried city. So, you know, science is amazing and because democracies are amazing and it's because none of us solves a problem all by ourselves. We're part of our kind of collective brain that works by rules where all of the excesses of one person get kind of balanced out by, uh, by other people. And that's why you have a, you know, things like a checks and balances in a democracy where instead of having a supreme leader who just runs the country the way he wants, he's got a worry about the legislature and the courts and the judges and you know, and in an impeachment and so on, in science, instead of having one genius announcing the way the world works, you know, he or she has to subject themselves to peer review and get, let other sciences criticize. Scientists, criticize him or her. And, uh, whenever you get people acting intelligently, it's often because they belong to these institutions with rules that are designed to make up for the idiocies of any individual person. Hmm.

Speaker 1:          00:36:36       That's fascinating. Um, I, I completely agree with that. That makes so much sense. I've also felt that there, there's not a lot, there's not, we have difficulties. Obviously people have difficulties in this life, their social difficulties, economic difficulties, but when, in terms of survival difficulties, it's, it's way easier to get by today than it has ever been in human history. And I wonder if human beings have a need for adversity and complexity and problem solving and all these things that are less. They're less present today than ever before. I think things are just almost too simple. We've made it to ease. We've nerf the world and in doing so, it's easier to just kind of be double minded and drift through and follow the herd. The herd is so big and there's so many people in the herd. If you just do what most people are doing, where what most of the people are wearing, say the things.

Speaker 1:          00:37:39       Most of the people say you'll survive and you'll survive and you'll find some other dimwitted person to breed with and you'll make dimwitted children. And I'm being dead serious. I think there's a certain, when you're dealing with this massive pack of humans, 300 plus million on a continent, there's just. There's so much. I've always said like if you have a group of people, if you're being very generous and you have 100 people in a room, what are the odds that one of those people is a moron? It's a hundred percent. That one is going to be a moron. That leaves you with $3 million morons in the United States of America if you're being really kind and 3 million geniuses. Yes. Yeah. Well, probably I. I'm an optimist. I would like to thank you. Dealing with probably 6 million genius.

Speaker 2:          00:38:22       Okay. Well, my book is often described as a book on optimism enlightenment now because I have 75 graphs, almost all of it showed the world getting better, including what some people think of the most incredible. A graph in the book on a phenomenon called the flynn effect, which is that, believe it or not, and I know most people do not. Iq scores have been rising for most of the last hundred years, but three points a decade. Now this I know, it seems totally unbelievable, but yeah, they discovered it with Flynn. A philosopher discovered it when he realized that the people who make Iq tests had to keep re norming the tests to keep a 100 as the average because the average kept creeping up and it was like 110 where we keep that. That's what most people score. We say that the average is 100. We got to adjust the scale downward and flint realized, Hey, wait a second, they keep doing this over and over again.

Speaker 2:          00:39:14       That must mean the population's getting smarter now, not biologically smarter. It's not that people's brainpower has somehow magically been increasing, although probably a little bit of that through better nutrition, better sanitation and health care and so on. But a lot of it is just that, a lot that ideas that used to be kind of sophisticated and restricted to professors and scientists and statisticians kind of trickle down to the population. And so we things like, um, a placebo effect or trade off or cost benefit analysis or win win situation, all these things that actually came from pretty fancy schmancy theory originally, but they kind of are loose stone the whole population and they become part of everyone's conventional wisdom. Also. We have to think more and more in abstract ways just to deal with things like a subway map or a smartphone. Uh, watching TV is, it used to be, you turn on your TV would be on, now you got to kind of program that bloody thing. So the demands of life have become more sophisticated and ideas spread more quickly and so we are quite literally getting smarter up to a point, things that can't go on forever, don't. And the flynn effect is starting to level off, but there has been this, this, uh, this drift upward in intelligence.

Speaker 1:          00:40:36       I don't think that's surprising at all. I think if you look at the amount of information that people are subject to today and just the sheer raw data, I mean there's a lot of the data is just nonsense and twitter and that. What is the quote that we produce? More content in two days. The entire human history every two days. Something crazy like that. Is that right? It sounds, it sounds plausible, but most of it is like, lol, I just went to the mall, you know, this is a lot of nonsense in there. But the sheer amount of interesting information, like those newly discovered Mayan Ruins in Guatemala and things along those lines, or you know, some, uh, there was some interesting new information on the history of human beings because they found some new teeth and some throwback the date of modern humans and they keep moving that back, which the point is we're constantly getting more information and more data, more things to think about. And I've just got to assume that the amount of information that comes to a person in 2018 is just vastly larger than the amount that came to them in 1978.

Speaker 2:          00:41:46       Oh, absolutely. And there are as idiotic as a lot of public debate is today. There's a lot of idiocy in the past. Sure. I mean, in the, uh, you know, as recently as the 19 sixties is that, that movie on the first interracial couple in Virginia where there was a court, a judge who said God didn't mean for the racist intermarry that's why he put black people in Africa and yellow people in Asia and white people in Europe. So the judge, the judge, hilarious. The judge said this in his decision eventually overturned loving versus Virginia. I'm now, I mean, no one would make that stupid an argument today, even even people that we think of as, as kind of racist, they'd be embarrassed and you're just too stupid and people on the, on the left made some pretty stupid arguments as well. Uh, when Castro sent all of the gay people to concentration camps in Cuba, you had Susan Sontag respected leftwing intellectual who's saying, well, this is, you know, you got to forgive them because a Latin America was such a sexualized culture and they were prostitutes.

Speaker 2:          00:42:50       It was decadence that of course it was a little bit of an overreaction. Now today, I don't think anyone on the, on the left or the right would say it's okay to send gay people to concentration camps because they were a lot of prostitutes in Havana. But that's the kind of idiotic statement that we kind of forget that people used to make in the past too. So it's way reassuring ourselves. Whenever we see a debate getting a seemingly getting stupider and stupider. You got to remember there's a lot of stupidity in the past too. Oh yeah, a massive amount. And I think, I think you're right that the, you know, it's hard to tell day by day, especially when your attention is concentrated by the worst things that happen. And again, this a big theme of, of, of uh, enlightenment now that your picture of the world when it's.

Speaker 2:          00:43:34       Because the human mind really is driven by anecdotes and images and stories and that's what the news gives us. But if you look at trends, uh, he follow the trend lines and not the headlines. You see that a lot of things really are getting better, uh, gradually. But that accumulates over time. And one of the things with the flow of information, we are actually getting more. We meaning Americans, but also worldwide. There is this trend of getting more liberal, more tolerant, more progressive, you know, hard to tell day by day. But when you think that in the 19 sixties there was a debate over whether there should be racial segregation, whether African Americans should drink out a different water fountains or stay in different motels. There's debate over whether women should be allowed in the workplace that, oh, what's going to happen to all the kids if they, uh, uh, uh, if they're all working, debate over whether gay people should be allowed to be teachers. Uh, and we've kind of forgotten these because the progressive

Speaker 3:          00:44:32       side kind of one and the debate has moved on and that happens worldwide as Pete, as information flows, as people start to meet each other as ideas proliferate, uh, there is this gradual trend toward more tolerance even in parts of the world where it seems to be totally absent. Like in a lot of the Islamic world, which world survey show this is the least progressive part of the world in terms of attitudes towards women attitudes towards gays, attitudes toward child rearing. But even the Islamic world, there's been a drift in the liberal direction. We just thought two weeks ago when Saudi Arabia allowed women to drive. I mean, it's kind of modest form of progress. Kind of Hilarious, hilarious. But you know, the progress, but it. But it shows, I mean, they just could not live in this absurd situation forever. The world really did drag them kicking and screaming out of the Middle Ages in this, in this way, and that kind of tends to happen over the long run.

Speaker 3:          00:45:30       Yeah. I'm, I'm an optimist and I, I really do. Look at all these trends. You'll, you'll, you'll like the book then 75 or 75 optimistic graphs. Oh, excellent. I, yeah. I think that if you look at just the overall human rights, I mean, one of the best indications of that is go and look at media representations of life from the 19 fifties and sixties. Watch movies, especially from the fifties, and just see how people behave. I mean it's, you're, you're getting sort of a, a timestamp of human interaction from 1950. It's obviously an artistic representation of a time. Doesn't have that time, but you get a sense of how people thought it was okay to behave. There was a lot of smacking women. Yeah, that's right. Yeah. Really common in movies, right? And children. You remember the scene where you know, junior would misbehave and mom would say, wait till your father gets home, and then dad comes home and he pulls the belt out of his pants so he could use it as a weapon.

Speaker 3:          00:46:25       So buckle would really hurt the child and the child would tie up a, a pillow on his behind and it'd be stars and go off into the corner. Now you'd call social services and they take the child away or something. Yeah. Well, I mean I think this idea of being dragged kicking and screaming into this new age, I think we're all doing that and I think you're seeing that in so many different parts of our culture today. You know, I think that's one of the things that's happening with this meat too. Movement is it all this mass public shaming of sexual harassers and sexual assaults and all this different thing. It's like forcing human beings to reassess the way they interact with each other and like this really radical, very quick sort of a movement over just a short period of time. Is that a giant impact on culture? Yeah, and like a lot of social changes, it, it happens really quickly, probably mixes some good things and some not so good things, right. Um, and it's really good that men no longer have a license to just expose themselves or, or

Speaker 2:          00:47:30       harass a woman who, who worked for them and treat them these crude and ugly waste, you know, when there is also a legitimate concern that, uh, you just can't really believe all accusers. I mean, we kind of learned that through history from, from, from, you know, witch hunts and lynchings and a pogroms and there's got to be proportionality. Not all infractions are, are the same, you know, the punishment should fit the crime. So we haven't quite settled in how to balance the very necessary corrective to two men harassing women with a kind of rule of law and standards of, of justice. I'm

Speaker 1:          00:48:09       correct me if I'm wrong about this, but this is one of my theories is, uh, we, our brains, our capacity and our understanding is relative to what's necessary at the time. And one of the things that I use is Dunbar's number. Dunbar's number is this idea that you could only have these intimate relationships with 150 or so people or in terms of intimacy of understanding who they are, knowing their name, knowing things about them, but as our circle of people that we interact with grows and expands. I wonder if that's going to expand as well. When you think about the amount of information that people can hold in their brain and what people are used to knowing about this is a radically different world in 2018 than it was in 1960. The amount of things that you were aware of in 1960, just by virtue of not having social media, the internet, Google, all the different ways that you could get information from. It's just so different. I mean it's. I don't know what, how many times more information you're getting, but it must be much more much more and over an incredibly small period of time. When you think about the, you know, the relative time span that human beings had been here a few hundred thousand years or whatever. I wonder if this is. I wonder if we're changing and I wonder what we're going to be like if this continues to grow and continues to be a part of our life. This, if we're going to adapt our abilities,

Speaker 2:          00:49:43       well we can't. We're not going to change the neuro, biological structure of the brain, you know, very much because even though we all learned through our lives, there are limits as to what our brain brain can do. But what I think happens is there's a back and forth between our brains and the technology. So the technology adjusts to take into account how the, how our brains work. So the, the, the restriction of can't know or feel that, you know, more than 100, 150 people in kind of helps define the set of top, top, rank friends in a social network. Uh, the fact that we're visual creatures, you know, we're, we're, we're primates. We get a lot of our, to our eyeballs. It's one of the reasons why computer technology has changed so much since the eighties and seventies. Like when I first learned to program a computer, it was just all text and a or use a computer.

Speaker 2:          00:50:39       I mean they're just 80 characters and aligned and you had the letters of the alphabet and that's all there was and it soon became clear that a, that's not a very efficient way of getting ideas into a brain. It's really laborious and tiring and so you have graphic user user interfaces. I mean the apple was the first to commercialize it, but it had been developed beforehand at Xerox, but it's really exotic at first when you saw a screen with these windows and pointers and icons and a mouse and computers don't work that way. Naturally you took a huge amount. Still does. Takes a huge amount of programming to get a computer to pretend that there's a sheet of paper up on the screen, but that because we're visual creatures, the technology adapted so that we could feel comfortable using it. So some of it is how much do we adjust to the technology and how much is the technology forced to adjust to us.

Speaker 1:          00:51:32       I'm thinking in terms of the actual capability of the human mind and when you read about the modern human brains, like there was an article that was published recently that was trying to read a map, the timeline of the modern human brain and I think they were pointing to about 35,000 years ago now and see if we can find that. Trying to figure out what exactly they were saying, but essentially they were saying that the human, the modern human brain was far more recent or interest. Again, I'm not surprised. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:52:07       Well I would have guessed a little bit older than that, but yeah, in the tens of thousands of years. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:52:12       So with the. One of the big mysteries, right is the doubling of the human brain size over a period of what it was like 2 million years. This something had happened to cause that some change in our environment, some changing our behavior and our what has been a bigger change in the internet. Like what has been a bigger change and the access to information that people have today. And I'm wondering if like we're not experiencing, when you're talking about these rises steady rise of Iq, obviously it's not just the internet, it's education, the cumulative data that people just keep piling onto and more people learn more things and people get wiser and you know, our, the way we interface with information is better than it's ever been before. But I wonder about the capacity and the capabilities of the human mind. If it's happening right now, it's just a very gradual thing. This 10 percent tick or 10 point tick per, per decade, if this is going to lead you, you extrapolate, you go 100 years from now, 200 years from now, we. What are we going to be looking at?

Speaker 2:          00:53:09       The thing is that what happened over the last few tens of thousands of years, it is not going to be replicated anytime soon because that was driven by Darwinian natural selection, which just meant that smarter people had more surviving babies. That's a process that as a speed limit measured in generations, uh, and it's, uh, it may not be that coping in a modern society makes you have more babies. And maybe the other way round, you know, as you're more educated, you have fewer children. Um, and so I think a lot of the, uh, there's going to be a certain amount of plasticity of what you can master in your own lifetime, especially if you start in childhood a, you're going to, a lot of these skills become second nature. How to look things up, how to, uh, how to use these devices efficiently. And then that will, can, can reach limits that only so many hours in the day.

Speaker 2:          00:54:03       And there was only so many neurons in your brain. But in conjunction with that, the technology becomes more human friendly. And there are new ways of getting information into the brain. You know, as I mentioned, we've gone from just lines of characters to graphic user interfaces and video and, and more like creative data graphics where you see moving colored graphs as a way of getting a bunch of variables into a human head more efficiently. And virtual reality might be the next step where we bought three d environments that we can explore. Uh, and that may be a way of, of getting our puny brains to experience more information.

Speaker 1:          00:54:43       Yeah. I was going to bring that up to you next [inaudible]. That's one of the things that concerns me the most is how good virtual reality is now, but how relatively crude it is in comparison to the potential. And have you experienced it at all? Have you used like an htc vive or any of those? No, I've used more kind of lower tech kinds of like, you know, Google cardboard and uh, that's Kinda interesting too. It's still pretty interesting, but the vibe will freak you out. There's one of the things, and I, I used, uh, several years ago, his version, I think my friend Duncan trussell had one, two or three years ago that I used and I was blown away by that where you're underwater and there's a whale swims up to you and you know, and it seems so real and it's get nauseous. No, I didn't, but it was, it was, I, it, it's obviously fake.

Speaker 1:          00:55:33       Like I'm looking at it and I can make a distinction quickly. Like when you see a movie and in the movie there's like fake dogs or something like that or fake monsters. You're like, oh, that's a fake thing. It's fake, but it's really good fake and I'm, I'm. I can recognize it as a fake, but I was like, wow, what is this going to be like in 10 years? What is it gonna be like in 30 years it's going to be and how much better is the interface going to be? I'm really concerned that there's going to be a just a giant section of our population that completely checks out of the regular world and lives in some strange fantasy land. Most of the time they just consumed food and water and figure out a way to feed themselves and spend most of their time locked into a helmet, living in some fantastic artificial environment that people have created. Yeah. Well,

Speaker 2:          00:56:24       although just putting things into perspective, there were that, those fears when television became popular even before that with movies, this is the question of what kind of balance people will, will find. I mean, clearly it's going to be more of exactly what you describe, but you know, people do. People do like reality to, uh, you know, people, uh, in huge numbers go to the national parks and just seeing a picture book isn't the same thing. And people care whether, you know, when they buy a work of art, they care whether it's real or fake. I, so there's a lot. There's one part of the human mind that, uh, as much as we're seduced by just sensual sensory experiences, we also, we have a sense of reality and we value it. And uh, you know, we don't like being fooled too much. And uh, uh, the question is what balance we find between the desire for authentic experience and the pleasure of these cheap artificial ones.

Speaker 1:          00:57:20       When you chose to write a book about enlightenment and you chose to write a book, the showing all these positive graphs and all these trends that seem to be optimistic. Are you, I'm writing that obviously you feel this way and this is the data and this is your interpretation of where we're headed. But are you also kind of like encouraging people in a way to have a more rose colored view of the world and just understand that

Speaker 2:          00:57:51       not so much rose colored but a bad description. I know exactly what you mean, but have a kind of problem solving mindset, namely, we have solved problems in the past, or at least we've, we've reduced them and that I think emboldens us to say, look, the problems we have now and think, well, we can handle those two if we decide to do now what our ancestors did in the past that led in the right directions. And I, I credit this to the, a mindset of the enlightenment, namely that with reason and science and a concern for human welfare, we can gradually make people better off and as long as we maintain that kind of philosophy of, of, of living, uh, then we, then there's a reasonable hope that we can solve the problems facing us. It doesn't happen by itself. There's not, you know, magic escalator. There's no, you know, uh, a arc of history or dialectic or any mystical stuff that just makes us better and better. There's a recognizing problems and figuring out how the world works and doing our best to solve them. So that was, that was the message and the fact that we have had progress contrary to the impressions you get from the headlines shows that this is not a crazy idealistic, optimistic pipe dream. It's happened and some more of it can happen.

Speaker 1:          00:59:10       Yeah. That's where I was going with this is that why do we have this desire to concentrate on the negative? Like I have a friend, my friend Ian Edwards has this bit about the news about renaming it to the bad news and he goes on this whole rant about the news. Check this out, but he's right and it is a thing that we. Is it because we have this concern like we have to recognize danger and we want to know what's happening so that we know that we're safe. But the reality is we're dealing with a world of 7 billion people with 7 billion stories. You know, so you're, you're gonna be able to see negative stuff all day long if you so choose to do that. If you so choose to concentrate on negativity and it gives you this bizarre portrait of the world that the world is just this horrible place, and the bill Hicks used to have a bit about CNN, about watching CNN and it'd be death aids, pit bulls. You go outside

Speaker 2:          01:00:04       Chirp and where's all this shit happening? I think there's a lot to that. That's good. That's a great, great examples.

Speaker 1:          01:00:12       We concentrate. What is our desire to concentrate only on the negative or mostly on the negative?

Speaker 2:          01:00:19       Well, there is a phenomenon in psychology called the negativity bias that bad is psychologically stronger than good. So we dragged that. We dread losses more than we enjoy gains and criticism hurts much more than praise makes you feel better. Uh, we're our, uh, our, our minds are attracted to possibilities of, of death and danger and so on. I think it's because we are really, as you say, we are vulnerable. There are many more things that could go wrong then could go right. And that's kind of a implication of the law of entropy. A, there's a tiny fraction of the way the world could work that works, works out well for you in an awful lot of ways that things can go wrong and so our minds are attuned to things that could go wrong and that kind of opens up a market for experts to remind us of things that can go wrong, but we may have forgotten and so the the news tends to gravitate to the negative and there are actually studies that show this. You give editors a two different framings of an event and optimistic one and a pessimistic when they pick the pessimistic one and that's a trend that's actually increased. I have a graph in the book, one of the 75 graphs that shows a an automatic analysis of the tone of the news. That is how often are there positive words like improve better? How often do their negative words like crisis disaster, catastrophe. The news has been getting more and more negative for about 70 years.

Speaker 1:          01:01:42       Is it uniform on both sides? Right, and left.

Speaker 2:          01:01:44       A good question. I don't know the answer. I suspect it is, but I don't know. I don't know the answer for sure. There were there fluctuations, there are ups and downs, but overall the trend has been downward. So partly it's all, even though, by the way, all the other graphs in the book show that in reality the world is actually been getting better. There are fewer deaths from war. There's fewer homicides were making some progress in a pollution. There's less poverty than there used to be more education. Uh, but the news has been getting more and more morose. Part of it is also that there's an, there is an ethic of journalism that to be responsible as point out what's going wrong. One editor said, a good good news isn't news. It's advertising. And it's also because of the timescale that it's very easy to destroy something really quickly.

Speaker 2:          01:02:32       I mean, something blows up and uh, that's news improvements tend to be gradual day by day and there's never a Thursday in March in which something happens that is, uh, as, as Max Roser, an economist Paul pointed out, newspapers could run the headline. One hundred and 38,000 people escaped from extreme poverty yesterday, every day for the last 30 years, but they never ran that headline even once because there was never a particular day in which the hundred and 38,000 people were different than 138,000 people the day before. And so the, a lot of the good things kind of creep up on us and they're never reported in headlines, whereas it's easy to blow something up and that, that does happen on a Thursday. So you have a, a very positive view of the future of humans. Well, it's uh, as, as, uh, the great, uh, Swedish, uh, a dot Ted Takstar, Hans Rosling put it when he was asked, are you an optimist? And he said, well, I'm not an optimist. I'm a very serious possible list. So what happens in the future? It depends on what we do now. And there are real threats and dangers. Sure, there's a possibility of nuclear war. There's a possibility of catastrophic climate change. So we can't sit back and say, well, things have gotten better. Let's let them continue. By sheer inertia or momentum, that's not gonna happen, but what it does indicate is, well, we face crises in the past and uh, we have made things better. Let's figure out how to deal with crises. Now.

Speaker 1:          01:04:01       That's a great way of looking at it too, to be realistic about it because the possibility of positive things is a real. That's real. But also there's a reason why we find those ruins in Guatemala. Those people are there anymore. I mean thriving culture, thousands of structures, and now it's a jungle. Like what happened? It's,

Speaker 2:          01:04:25       it's wise to remember that that can't happen. Didn't become Manhattan. That's right. I mean there is. I think there is a difference between modern all modern societies and all of the ones that did collapse. Namely that after the enlightenment we developed a kind of a scientific network and community. We develop the habit of free speech and open debate and accumulation of information in written in an electronic records. I mean, it is not the same now. It doesn't mean that we're out of danger because we've created new dangers, you know, like, like nuclear war, like climate change. But there is a, a, there are mechanisms in place that if we concentrate them, if we are determined to keep doing it, then there's a reasonable expectation of success again, but not automatically. We've got to decide to make. We've got to make those choices.

Speaker 1:          01:05:21       Yeah. The, the, the, the, the history of the human race is so weird in terms of the rise and fall of these civilizations and cultures that were always a least. I am always looking at like what, how long is this going to last? Like how long has this one particular nation going to keep it together? I mean if you look at how many different countries have been around that, just how many, you know, dominant culture is Rome for instance. Like just now it's just Italy. It's just normal, you know, it's like a normal European country. It used to be this conquering nation. Like how, how long can we keep this thing up and what are your thoughts on the future of, of just even the idea of nations. It seems like our bout our boundaries and our borders, the way we have a online, this ability to communicate with people all over the place, everywhere. It seems to me to lessen the necessary or the need rather for for borders and for, for these walls that we're now literally and figuratively talking about putting up.

Speaker 2:          01:06:30       I think there's going to be a kind of a balance. It's an interesting thing about nation states now is that there is a sense in which they're treated as immortal, that whereas as you mentioned for most of history, they were conquering. Emperors and a nation. Nations were wiped off the map and engulfed and conquered. And you're now you look at a map of the world and, uh, it's actually not that different from what it was 70 years ago. I mean, there are colonies that achieved independence. There's some big states like Soviet Union that broke fragmented, but the borders in between the ribs, Soviet republics are now borders between nation states and no nation has gone out of existence through conquest since, uh, since 1945, at least internationally recognized state by the, by the UN. So there's this norm, even though the borders are often, you know, crazy.

Speaker 2:          01:07:22       Then they were arbitrary lines drawn a map. But one of the reasons that, again, this is counterintuitive, that wars have gone down and deaths and wars have gone down, is that borders are now treated as sacrosanct by the kind of international community. Not One hundred percent of the time you had Russia annexing Crimea, but those are exceptions. And by and large unlike say in the past, in the 19th century where the US had an unpaid debt from Mexico, so it conquered, you know, Texas and Colorado and Nevada and California, you know, that doesn't happen anymore. And so the board has kind of been grandfathered in and that's one of the reasons why the, uh, the, the, the world has been more stable in terms of the, uh, the map. On the other hand, as you mentioned, there's another sense in which we have this global community that transcends borders.

Speaker 2:          01:08:12       We have things like the European Union, we have the United Nations, we have a trade agreements like Nafta, which try to get simultaneously the grandfathered borders, but this extra layer of cooperation that transcends the borders and we need them more and more despite the fact that our, our current president is pushing back against the global community, but because there are problems that are global that my migration, terrorism, climate pollution, rogue states, and the fact that people, even if they, even if you grew up in France and you consider yourself a French citizen, you want to be able to spend a summer in, um, you know, in, in Italy or in England or in Belgium, if that's where there's a good job and there's a desire among people to be able to move to wherever the opportunities are best. So there's going to be some kind of compromise, I think, between keeping the, the, the, the nation state borders just so you don't have constant wars of conquest and border disputes, but allowing the world and allowing the people of the world to take advantage of a true global community.

Speaker 1:          01:09:18       Yeah. I feel like that's one of the things that people were most upset about brexit was that this is a, even though they, the people that were pro brexit felt like this was in the interest of the UK and the interest of England to be separate from all this because they were doing better and because they didn't want all the negative possibilities from all these other places coming into their environment. But the, what I think that people, what they didn't like about it was the idea that this is a regressive move and that the progressive move is that we would all move towards this idea of a global community of this entire world being free and connected. And you know, we've talked about, um, some of the problems that Paris has with the immigration. We showed some of the videos of these, uh, these immigrants that are just littered all over the street and taking this place apart.

Speaker 1:          01:10:17       And we're looking at it going, man, that is a, that is a real tragedy. But what it represents is a bunch of people that really don't have anything. Like. The real tragedy is that these people live like this. The real tragedy is not that they've done it to Paris. The real tragedy is that these people exist at all and that they moved to Paris looking for a better life and now they're stuck in the situation where you know there's not a lot of sanitation and the garbage is all over the place. They're literally everywhere and it's. I wonder if we ever will have a world where there isn't a place where you can go and ship a factory and pay people a dollar an hour because they don't need a dollar an hour because it's just like living in Los Angeles or just like living in Phoenix, like you would never be able to pay someone a dollar an hour because there's too much opportunity. The world has caught up and surpassed it.

Speaker 2:          01:11:09       Yeah. There's a number of really complicated issues that they. Your mobility is in general a good thing in countries do well when they welcomed Indian immigrants, but not on the short term. Yeah. Not too many. Too fast. Faster than they can be assimilated and integrated into the new country. So it just opening the doors probably is not a good idea. No country really does that, but building the wall is a terrible idea to uh, and of course the, the, the, the best way to prevent a massive amounts of, of migration is to make life better in the countries of origin because that is happening slowly and unevenly. But it's been noted that even United States and Mexico, more people are going, or the same number of people are doing the reverse migration from the US back to Mexico now that the economy of Mexico so much my own parents when 25 years.

Speaker 2:          01:12:02       Okay. Yeah. My parents live in Mexico. Okay. There you go. Yeah. Um, and there is a, a, um, a harder to detect, but there is a huge improvement in the standard of living in what used to be called the third world, the developing world where, um, the, if you look at the cutoff for extreme poverty kind of defined, defined somewhat arbitrarily is a dollar 90 per person per day, kind of the bare, bare, bare minimum to feed, feed your family. Uh, it's down now from a 50 percent a few decades ago to 10 percent now, and the United Nations have set the goal of bringing it to zero by the year 20, 30, and what street, what is causing that? What's causing the change? So a lot of it is, um, globalization that, I mean even though that's kind of a villain in many people's eyes, but when you have a, a, a huge global market than a and the introduction of, of uh, factories and industrialization in China, in India and Bangladesh, sometimes the conditions are grim, but the conditions being a peasant in the rice patties was even grimmer.

Speaker 2:          01:13:05       And when, when you have a people integrated with the economy, selling their products on a world stage, uh, they can get richer. And so a lot of also better policies. We have governments that are no longer a communist or like really heavy handed forms of socialism where everything is defined by the bureaucrats. And you need 50 licenses to do anything and you have a little bit more economic flexibility that tends to make the country's richer. It doesn't mean that you could do away with regulations on workplace safety and, and, uh, environment and as countries get richer, they tend to be more protective of their workers and the environment, right? And leaders that think of their mandate as how do I get my country to be richer? And the most dramatic case was China where, uh, you know, Mao had these harebrained schemes have huge collective farms and people smelting iron in their backyards and you know, anything that occurred to him in the middle of the night, he would force on hundreds of millions of people and it cost these massive famines. Then Deng, Deng Xiaoping took over and he said, getting Richard Good, uh, and he said, black cat, white cat, as long as it catches mice, it's a good cat. So much more pragmatic, much more concerned with the welfare of their citizens. When you have leaders who have that mindset, then the country can, can get, get wealthier and their citizens better off

Speaker 1:          01:14:34       now. But are you concerned? I mean, I, I agree with you that it is probably is one of the reasons why these people are experiencing this greater quality of life is because of globalization because these factories moving in, but they're living lives that are very different and maybe perhaps it's by our standards that their lives are better. That may be if these indigenous people were living this sort of subsistence lifestyle that even though on paper they would be existing in extreme poverty, but if they're perhaps like living in the jungle or somewhere along those lines where you have access to all these natural resources that even though they'd be living in extreme poverty, they'd be living maybe, perhaps even a better life by just eating the fish and eating the plants and hunting and fishing and doing what they had normally done for thousands and thousands of years rather than making a dollar an hour and a Nike factory.

Speaker 2:          01:15:26       Right. And it's certainly true that indigenous peoples who are living in a hunter and horticultural lifestyles, that there are real crimes in displacing them often. Not so much by factories but by miners and loggers. But the, the, there are a very tiny fraction of the world's population, tragically, uh, the vast majority of poor people or more are peasants, not, not, not, not horticulturalists. And, and you know, they are kind of agricultural laborers and for them just based on their own choices, uh, often the factory life is a, is an improvement. It's an improvement, not just because they're not a kind of in the fields, knee deep in muck a pulling up seedlings and getting bitten by disease carrying a bugs. But, um, for women, uh, being able to move from a, a village to a city often means liberation that they can start a business and the kids to school, uh, be out from under the thumbs of their husbands and the husband's family. They're kind of can be a liberation just just as what our aunts, our ancestors did when they left the farms for cities a hundred and 50 years ago. So not to say there isn't exploitation and, uh, and cruelty which ought to be opposed. And in the case of native peoples, often, you know, criminal, uh, displacements. But on the whole globalization has led to this escape from grinding poverty for literally hundreds of millions of people.

Speaker 1:          01:17:01       So even when they moved these factories into these places in charge or pay them a dollar an hour, rather, it still a dollar an hour than

Speaker 3:          01:17:10       they would've gotten if the factory had been there. In many cases. That's true. Which exploitation. But you know, we look at our and said, you know, my grandparents worked in a clothing factory and uh, when they emigrated from Poland to Canada and it often is a route to upward mobility. Yeah, it's, it's hard for us to accept that or even think about it that way because it was saying, well, why? How come they don't have to pay these Mexican folks minimum wage just like they do in America? Like, well, why don't they have the same sort of setup we do here? Just seems cruel. It doesn't impair, no doubt there is cruelty. But the relevant

Speaker 2:          01:17:45       Harrison is not so much a difference between working in a factory there and working in an office, you know, in Berkeley or Manhattan. It's the difference between working in a factory

Speaker 3:          01:17:57       there and, uh, and, and laboring in the fields there. And the people are often given that choice. They line up to the factory jobs. Do you anticipate a time where there is no third world and there is no, it's a massive economic disparity.

Speaker 2:          01:18:13       It's conceivable, um, you know, it's a ways off, but it's happened in huge parts of the world. I mean, we forget that places like South Korea now, you know, this rich, a upper middle class society, uh, not so long ago. That was the third world. I mean, they were, they were hungry. They were, uh, the, the, the, the children died young. A lot of them living in squalor. Uh, and that was true in certainly in China. Lots of parts of places, parts of China now that are pretty much middle class that we're a squalid not so long ago, a Singapore. Uh, I have, uh, an anecdote in the book of enlightenment now with my ex mother in law who grew up in Singapore and she remembers a childhood meal in which her family split one egg for ways. I was back in the, uh, in the 19 forties, Singapore is now one of the world's richest countries, so it can happen. It is happening. The most remote, poorest parts of the world are going to be the hardest to bring up to middle class standards. Like, you know, Congo like Haiti, like Afghanistan, but large parts of the world. There's been a huge increase in the standard of living.

Speaker 3:          01:19:23       Um, you talked recently about the dangers of overly politically correct thinking of or just politically correct thinking of have a sort of a rebound effect where political correct thinking is actually causing more extremism, uh, more and more radical thinking in new, in terms of response to that, like an overcorrection at the, at the top of our conversation we

Speaker 2:          01:19:52       talked about the possibility of, of sex differences as being kind of taboo from polite company. And in a lot. I'll give another example, and this is kind of connects to our conversation, isn't a lot of academia. There's just capitalism is just a dirty word or something now called the Neo liberalism and you know, a, a, a certain percentage. Surprisingly, large percentage of academics are actually Marxists, probably about 15 percent in the social sciences, uh, and uh, to say the obvious fact that capitalism is better than communism. I mean, that's just a fact. I mean, just compared, we would rather live in South Korea or North Korea would rather live in the old East Germany or West Germany, a I'd rather live now in Venezuela or in Chile and it's just obvious that capitalism makes people a richer and freer and better off in pretty much every way. Now. That's a fact.

Speaker 2:          01:20:46       That's almost unmentionable in academia now, but he say it by itself and suddenly people discover it for the first time. Then you can get the extreme right wing position that any amount of regulation is bad. Any amount of social spending is bad. We need the most extreme form of almost an arco capitalism like radical libertarianism. And that's because I argue that if you never have a discussion of the relative advantages and disadvantages of different economic systems, you never hear the arguments for why some mixture of a free market with regulation of things that have to be regulated because the market won't take care of them, like pollution. I mean the market just won't put up, put a price on the atmosphere because no one owns the atmosphere. And so having a combination of a free market with environmental regulations gives you the best of both worlds.

Speaker 2:          01:21:42       Likewise, social spending for the elderly, for children, for the sick, for the unlucky, a bath not incompatible with a free market, and in fact some of the countries who have the strongest social safety nets, also one of the ones with the most economic freedom. So that argument that I've just given you right now just doesn't take place because there's just such a commitment to the idea that capitalism is bad. Opening up the possibility that someone discovers hate capitalism isn't so bad, then they reap to the strongest possible conclusion. Well, if as soon as you have social security, then we're going to be like Venezuela, Venezuela, or or, or, or, or our carbon pricing and the rational way of organizing society with just the right balance of free markets. Regulation. Social spending is just something that doesn't get discussed out in the open. You get these polarized extremes and that that's the argument that what's the origin of that thought process in academia?

Speaker 2:          01:22:40       Like why has capitalism and demonized and socialism being been praised despite all the evidence that especially Marxist socialism or Marxism is just, it's never been shown to be effective and it's been shown to be very dangerous. Yeah, it's a good question. One theory from Thomas Sowell, an economist at the hoover institution is that intellectuals tend to like systems that where you can articulate a theory and a bunch of verbal propositions and you know, the government kind of implements them. Whereas there are certain phenomena in, in, in social life like market economies where the intelligence is distributed across millions of people. No one actually knows how to make the system work, but people make things look for buyers. They set the price where people will, will buy them, and then over the entire society, things kind of work out, but no one, actually no single individual has the theory as to how that ought to work.

Speaker 2:          01:23:40       Uh, language is another example. I mean, there's no committee that designed the English language. There is no theory of how the English language ought to work. It's like hundreds of millions of people just talking and they invent new slang and they slur and they emphasize and they borrow from other languages. And the language changes and it works pretty well. Here we are speaking in English and no committee ever designed it. So according to souls theory and he, I think he was influenced by a High Eq Friedrich Hayek, the Austrian economist, that systems of distributed intelligence where no one genius ever designed it, but millions of people cooperating, give rise to a collective intelligence kind of run against the grain or the way intellectuals often think, not all intellectuals, because of course you could do what high console did and realized there is this phenomenon of collective intelligence. But if your first impulse is what's the theory, uh, you know, what are the set of principles, then you're going to gravitate to planned, you know, hyper plan systems and the a little bit oblivious to distributed systems,

Speaker 1:          01:24:48       but in academia for whatever reason, looking at things in terms of a, from a social standpoint, looking at things is a distribution of wealth is a big, a common subject that keeps getting brought up and class structures that there's going to be a time if everything works out correctly. If we continue to evolve our culture where we will no longer have classes, we'll know and we'll be able to distribute wealth completely equally across the board, but it sort of denying the motivation that human beings have to succeed. It's designing the denying this desire that people have to stand out and to overachieve or to, to be, to be an outlier in terms of performance, which is just a natural part of human beings and also competition. That competition is fueled by reward and without competition, you don't have iphones. You don't have most of the technological innovation that we have that's been funded by these companies have done it in order to make money. There's, there's to be some sort of a reason why they pushed all these things. It's so ironic when someone is talking about how capitalism sucks

Speaker 2:          01:26:04       on an iphone. I mean, didn't Jesus Christ. That is one of the more bizarre ironies is unexposed. Will you put your finger on another phenomenon? And I discussed this in my book, the blank slate when I also discussed the kind of the politics of gender that part of it is there's a history to it. So there was an idea sometimes called social darwinism. It wasn't, it had nothing to do with Darwin and ironically, but the idea that the only way society's progresses through ruthless cutthroat competition and poor people are just dragging the species down and you know, screw them, and if we were were were bleeding hearts than will retard the progress of society. And we need, you know, just everyone against everyone else for two to advance. Now you know that that's really not a very good way to organize a society. But there's such a reaction against that in the 20th century that you got the opposite extreme, that we are all blank slates.

Speaker 2:          01:26:59       That is, we all start off a identical and that, uh, any kind of competition is bad. You need kind of this, the benevolent government to distribute everything in the fairest possible manner. Now, the reality is, is something in between, we are a, there's going to be an equality in any fair system simply because some people really are smarter than others and some people have more discipline and more self control and uh, and it's good to harness that so that our competitive impulses have some people burning the midnight oil and racking their brains to how to make things better off because they anticipate some rewards. You don't want to sap all incentives, which is kind of what happened in the Soviet Union. You also don't want a central committee to decide that everyone has to have the same amount and parcel out every reward because that just gives too much power to a government.

Speaker 2:          01:27:58       But it also doesn't mean that you have the opposite extreme where the, you know, the poor people die, then it's their own fault because they're lazy and stupid. I mean, that's just not true. It's not humane. And what we need to do is find the right balance between competition and freedom that makes everyone better off and recognition that just be, there are going to be people who are not as smart, but they don't deserve to starve a, there are people who are just going to be unlucky because a lot of wealth isn't distributed by a talent and hard work, but there's a lot of luck that goes into it as well. And so we may want to kind of, uh, a sand down some of the sharp edges of competition. There it, it doesn't have to be either or. And the thing is, if you make one position taboo, then it makes things either or.

Speaker 2:          01:28:43       But how bizarre is it that these kinds of rational conversations about this very important subject is taboo in intellectual circles and it's not good academia. How did that happen? It's not good. I, you know, I think some of it is a reaction to the excesses of the past, some of it, because people do tend to form a kind of intellectual tribes the same way you have sports teams, uh, and you root for your team and you know, and when you're a sports fan, when you acquire information isn't to become better and better informed in some objective way. It's to kind of enhance the fan experience. You want to find out what's great about your team and what's awful about the other team. And that's a human habit that we bring to intellectual debates where and, and academia, academics or are susceptible to it as anyone.

Speaker 2:          01:29:34       Anyone else, unless they take steps to recognize it and avoid it. But you know, if you're on the left, you root for the left team and if you're on the right, not so much in the universities but in the think tanks, you root for the right team and you tend to discount evidence that goes against your ideology. You kind of filter out the things that are a little bit embarrassing. Uh, and uh, uh, people then a adopt certain opinions is almost loyalty badges and this is true of a lot of controversies that people often think are due to scientific illiteracy, like climate change where you ask a lot of scientists, why do people deny the obvious facts of, of manmade climate change. And I think, well, people just don't get enough information that we need better outreach and I think we do need better outreach, but in fact, and I talk about this and enlightenment and enlightenment now, if you actually do surveys of how well people understand climate science is not virtually no correlation between acknowledgement of human made, climate change and sophistication in climate science.

Speaker 2:          01:30:37       So you get people who do believe in human made climate change, which I think is an incontrovertible fact at this point, but they don't really understand it. I mean, they may even think, oh, it's caused by a hole in the ozone layer and we can fix it by cleaning up toxic waste dumps me like crazy beliefs, but they're still on. You know, what I would consider the right, the right side. What happens is that in some politicized debates, the people don't, don't so much care about the truth. They care about what belief will earn them esteem in their, their peer group. Right? Right. This is human psychology, but it's really bad when it comes to arriving at the best understanding of the truth collectively and what we need both in the left wing academic departments and the right wing think tanks is kind of recognition.

Speaker 2:          01:31:24       We're probably all wrong about a lot of things, especially if we talk to each other and, and act like kind of litigators like lawyers who mouth the best possible case for our side to prosecuted against the other side. That's just not a good way of arriving at the truth. You've got to kind of check the tendencies in yourself to just want more and more evidence for your belief and force yourself to be enforced other people to be as open minded as possible. Yeah. It's very fascinating to me. These, um, these sort of mindsets that, uh, that you on the left

Speaker 1:          01:31:59       and on the right, that there are certain subjects that you, if you support that subject, you are automatically thought of as a left winger. Have you support this subject? You're already automatically thought of as a rule if you were on the right, you probably think, yeah, in some way, like if, if someone says to me that they think that climate change is probably an overblown thing and it's a cycle that the world has been going through forever, I go, you're a right winger and you'd be right. Yeah. Almost always, always, always. And if you think, you know, all gay people should be allowed to get married. Who Cares? Oh, you're probably left winger.

Speaker 2:          01:32:33       Yeah, that's probably true 10 years ago. And it's actually less true now. That's what these amazing changes. So sometimes there can be these changes. They just catch us all by surprise and gay marriage is one of them. I mean that was like, even people on the left had misgivings about climate change. I've ever been gay marriage. I'm sorry, in the nineties it was still something that a lot of people on the left, we're kind of had let him, let's not go that far. Maybe we should have civil unions or you know, now the whole of the country is flipped, but you. But in general so these changes can happen, but you're right that a lot of opinions are just loyalty badges to a coalition and they can sometimes change in very strange ways. So we've seen it in the last year or so with a Donald Trump who is in many ways that pretty radical right winger in things like, what do you think?

Speaker 2:          01:33:26       What do, what's your opinion of Russia now for decades? If you're on the right, you mistrusted Russia and if you're on the left there, you know they weren't so bad, they misunderstood. Now it's totally flipped and opinions on whether you trust Russia just because of the influence of Donald trump have shifted. So the people on the right are more sympathetic to Russia. Something that would have been almost unthinkable even 10 years ago. Free Trade is another example. It was kind of a right wing cars and then trump managed to flip it. So what it shows is where I'm going with this and this is something that I've, where I've changed my mind. I used to think they were these ideologies, kind of like religious catechisms where these are the beliefs that follow from one another, but a lot of us just rot tribalism. It just like, you know, in sports, the players, your churn through the tip, the rosters with free agency and you know, we used to be a guy. He's a good guy. Well that he's on the other team now. He's a bad guy. It was Jerry Seinfeld once said you rooting for clothing and that kind of happens with political ideologies as well to I think to everyone's shock.

Speaker 1:          01:34:34       Yeah. That the tribalism thing is very, very confusing to me because you could see it like it's such an obvious pattern and that when it, when it plays out, like, you know, the global warming thing. I was having a conversation with a guy in my Jujitsu class and I'll never forget this. And he was like, ah, it's been a. it's a cycle, it's a cycle of global warming and climate change has always been a cycle and you know the people that say that it's not. It's like, oh, what will. How much have you studied other scientists? Like, I don't know a lot about global warming. I don't know a lot about climate change, but I know what I've read and it seems to me to be a very complex issue and I'm talking to this 25 year old guy who was in the military who's telling me this. I mean, do you have an education? And it's like, no. I'm like, well, why didn't you just automatically like decide that this is a more talking about the very temperature of the planet earth that's complex and what is causing it? Is it a carbon monoxide thing? Is it a what? Why do you just automatically subscribed to this and it's because that's how his tribe communicates. This is how his tribe and that it gives people comfort to be in these weird little groups where everybody has group think.

Speaker 2:          01:35:49       Yeah, and this is a a, a. I talk about this phenomenon in enlightenment now because it's a book that argues for, uh, the, the importance of reason and, uh, and how there has been progress thanks to application of reason and a natural pushback is, well, you look at things like that, we don't seem so reasonable. It's as a species, how can you, what's going on that were gay? We seem to be getting less reasonable. And I think the answer is there's reason can work in, for different goals. And here I'm using the ideas of a Yale scholar named Dan Dan Daniel Kahan where he knows there's a perverse way in which there's actually is a kind of rationality to that kind of belief. Namely, when you vote, what are the chances that your vote's really gonna swing reelection pretty close to zero. On the other hand, when you express an opinion in your, your peer group, the people you work with, your family, what are the chances that holding a wrong opinion will lead you to be kind of condemned and ostracized and treated as a real weirdo?

Speaker 2:          01:36:52       You know, very high. So if you're, if everyone thinks what opinion is going to help my esteem and the people I care about, they can latch onto all kinds of beliefs if they've become kind of identity badges for their tribe. Uh, this is rational in terms of the world they live in. It's not so rational for the planet as a whole. If people just subscribed to beliefs based on tribal loyalty instead of truth and the challenges, how do we align beliefs more with truth and less with tribal loyalty? Now it's not hopeless because there are a lot of beliefs that people used to have that are, that have been, have been overturned. People don't believe in Unicorns anymore or alchemy and fueled. People believe in astrology and, and a lot of scientific issues are. There's no controversy. Do Antibiotics work? Yeah, I mean there's no, you know, it doesn't matter whether you're in the right or the left.

Speaker 2:          01:37:44       So part of the challenge is how do we get more and more of our beliefs to be, to get, have our social norms be such that if you believe something just because you're on the writer on the left, then you're an idiot. But what you should be doing is looking at the best possible study with an open mind. That's what a cool person does and only an idiot just parrots the the right wing lined. That's the kind of social change we need to aim for. Ryan, just. I'm almost a shaming of that kind of ignorance. This is the desire that people have to subscribe to a predetermined pattern of thinking and behaving because it's. It's comforting. It's comforting that you know, and it also like they know that other people on their group will also think like that. It's like if you're in the right.

Speaker 2:          01:38:28       One of the things about you see about right wingers, it's kind of hilarious. I was watching this Kyle Kuklinski secular talk podcast where he was talking about this, these Christians who were talking about trump, and when you are on the right, you must have a belief in God. You just have to, and when they were talking about trump, they were saying, we're talking about the man that existed before he accepted Jesus. You know, I don't have it, but the guy was literally saying, I don't have a past. Okay, how about you? Because I've accepted Jesus Christ into my life and that once you accept Jesus Christ, like you are now a believer in Christ and you're for, you're forgiven for all of your past sins. And this is, this is on the right. There's a giant percentage of the people that are on the right that subscribed to I a religious Christian mindset.

Speaker 2:          01:39:20       It is fascinating, especially when it comes to our current president who by any standards is like the least Christian leader that we've ever had passed. He accepted Jesus. He doesn't have a past. Well, yeah, but he's still, you know, the Christian virtues include things like modesty for the week. Sure. A temperance. Chivalry Gentlemen leanness and this guy is lewd and vainglorious and arrogant and contemptuous for for losers, but which shows, again, kind of going back to our discussion, it's just amazing how much loyalty doesn't have to do with the actual content of the beliefs. It's just whoever's on on my side, and of course he promised a lot of perks for the, for the religious right, like the repeal of the amendment that a tax exempt organizations can't engage in politics and lobbying the so called the Johnson amendment, which meant that if you're a church, if you don't pay taxes, you can't be politically active.

Speaker 2:          01:40:20       Well, they didn't like that and he promised to repeal that amendment and so he got their loyalty and so it was just raw political muscle kind of overcame Christian virtue. So bizarre. So bizarre. Yeah, but it's, it's fascinating to watch just these patterns, these tribal ideological patterns when you see these groups that have this sort of one mindset and this very clear. The thing is I can flip another example. People forget this is so take environmentalist them, you know, kind of quintessential, you know, left green cars. Not so long ago, it was the other way around is actually considered to be a cause of the right. Why? Well, if you are, if you're a left wing activist in the sixties, he would say, well, the only people concerned with the environment are rich people who liked the view from their country estates and they don't want them to be spoiled by being cut down for apartments, for poor people, uh, or they're, you know, duck hunters who want to be able to go and hunt ducks and, and if you're really socially concerned, you should care about Vietnam and racism and poverty and it's just a luxury to worry about, you know, trees and flowers and ducks that I flipped and then environmentalist and became a leftwing cause.

Speaker 2:          01:41:33       But it, these, uh, these connections between your coalition and your beliefs aren't set in stone. Yeah. It wasn't at the beginning of the forming of the political parties. It was. The Democrats were very different and Republicans are more like Democrats. Oh yeah. Well, starting with Abraham Lincoln, the first republican president and they were the, the, the, of course they were the party against slavery. And in fact, even in my lifetime, through the sixties, in the south, the Democrats were the right wing racist party. I mean, had George Wallace, the governor of Alabama who said segregation now, segregation forever. He was a democrat. He formed his own party in [inaudible], 68. Then back in [inaudible] 72, he ran for the Democratic nomination. And the southern Democrats were they the kind of the right wingers. And it was often the northeast Republicans who were the liberals. That's still partly true in Massachusetts. We had a little bit of a remnant of that.

Speaker 2:          01:42:32       We've had some liberal Republican governors. We have one right now. Charlie Baker was a Republican and he's pretty moderate middle of the road, uh, William Weld, who was then the libertarian vice presidential candidate. He was a republican even, you know, even when Mitt Romney was our governor, he was not particularly conservative. He was a republican. So there's the remnants of that in Massachusetts. They used to be a little bit of that in New York where they were liberal Republicans. Uh, but yeah, that's a case where it's flipped and now democratic was left of center Republican, right, of center. Yeah. You've seen some of that also with some rub. Republicans have tried to disingenuously connect the Democratic Party with the KKK because of the past. Well, and that was true. That was true. But you know, they're talking about the people in the present that, you know, this is the party of the support of the KKK. Well, sorta. Yeah, that means that all the time ago, that was the end. Yeah. Different people. Yeah. It's um, it's just fascinating to me to watch these groups of people and uh, you know, we've talked about um, political parties, the right versus the left. It's always weird to me that there are these two sides and that people sort of like take comfort and in choosing this group that they identify with these

Speaker 1:          01:43:51       issues where, you know, I identify as a right wing, I identify as a left identify as this, that these, these things are very rigid in their structure and they don't allow for nuance thinking and they don't allow for being objective about issues. And considering the other side, considering other people's points of view and the way they're looking at things and thinking of maybe there's some common ground

Speaker 2:          01:44:18       I agree, and in fact, in, in like mit now has the subtitle, the case for reasons science humanism and progress. And so I have a chapter on reason. I had a chapter on and I have a chapter on humanism, but in the chapter on reason, I asked the question why does it? On the one hand it appears that we're getting smarter. There's the flynn effect of rising Iq scores and there are a lot of areas in life where what you see just much more intelligence being applied in just a few years ago. So just for example, uh, you know, moving in evidence based medicine, a lot of what your doctor does, it's just based on kind of superstition and tradition. And now people are saying, well, let's, you know, let's do a randomized controlled trial, see what works, what doesn't. So is getting smarter. You look at policing, one of the reasons that the crime rate has gone down so much, uh, another positive development that I, I talk about that people aren't aware of is that policing has gotten smarter.

Speaker 2:          01:45:14       They everyday, especially in New York, they would gather data as to where the homicides were, which neighborhoods, which blocks and which neighborhoods and they would concentrate the police forces, you know, on that day and to prevent things from getting out of control with cycles of revenge. You at sports know moneyball, where you've got kind of smarter teams that can beat, reached Richard Teams. You look at policy and you've got evidenced based policy. So all these areas where it looks like the country's getting smarter, but then there are all these areas we're looking at Kennedy's getting lots of Jupiter and a lot of them are, I argue cases where people were issues get politicized and then people just go with their own coalition. And the ideal would be, and this is an ideal that's in least preached in science and to some extent practice, you know, there's not leftwing science and writing science.

Speaker 2:          01:46:06       It's what are the data? What did the data say if you haven't seen, let's do an experiment. Let's see who's right, who's wrong, and either side might be embarrassed and I think in the case of these great political and economic issues we've got, we'd be better off if we thought like scientists kept an open mind and say, well, what works? There's a minimum wage lead to a higher unemployment because labor becomes more expensive. Well, maybe, you know, beats me if I know. Let's let look at areas that have tried it. See what happens. Uh, do, does too much welfare. Make people, you know, unambitious and Lacey. Well, uh, you know, I can't figure this out from my arm chair, but let's look at different. Compare. Different countries compare different states and cities issue after issue. I think we need to be much more pragmatic and open to evidence,

Speaker 1:          01:46:53       but when you do deal with these issues, much like you were talking about, the difference between genders, when you deal with the actual raw data, that raw data, a lot of it gets very problematic for people that hold these ideas very rigidly in their mind. And they don't, they don't want to accept certain facts and Statistics and they come up with reasons why these things are either inaccurate or biased or racist or sexist or what have you.

Speaker 2:          01:47:21       Yeah, no, that's really true because I think we're, I think evolution didn't make us into a intuitive scientists so much as a tool intuitive lawyers and preachers. So we, the natural tendency is to amass the strongest possible case for your own side and to a boast that you, the, you are the side of virtue. The people who disagree with you are idiots. And, and, and, uh, evil. Uh, and we got to push back against that tendency. I, I argued with enlightenment now.

Speaker 1:          01:47:54       Yeah. I just, I try to recognize that in my own mind when it comes up. But it's, it's so incredibly common that tribalism that we see on the right and the left, we see it. Men versus women. We oftentimes see it even in gay versus straight. It's, it's, it's a very bizarre but incredibly common aspect of being a human being.

Speaker 2:          01:48:17       It really is. And I started out as a, as a psychologist, a clinical psychologist. I don't see patients but on the cognitive scientists, so I'm interested in how the mind works and so a lot of my ideas on which way we're going to keep going in a positive direction are influenced by a kind of a recognition of what makes us tick and what are the pitfalls in having a human brain. And I mean, I, I don't take credit for this. This goes back to, for example, the American, uh, founders and framers, Madison and Jefferson and Adams and Hamilton, when they were arguing, well, how should we set up this new new country, this new government? They will kind of intuitive psychologists and they would point it out that, well, if you just empower a leader, he's going to get drunk with his own power and he's going to be diluted. And what do we do about that? Because we do need some kind of leader. Well, you've got these checks and balances. How do, what makes people better off? They, if they can exchange things and each one produces something they're good at and trades it with something that someone else produces. How do we set up a country where it takes advantage of people's tendency to treat things, so the connection between politics and psychology was has been there for a long time. Now. The, the,

Speaker 1:          01:49:36       the subject enlightenment. That's a very loaded subject because it is. Yeah, and especially in the world of Weirdos and cult leaders, Charlotte Tins and people that are sort of promoting this idea, this idea that you can achieve this sort of zen state of bliss, of being above it. All of being, you know, wise to the point of being a sage. That's a. that's a weird concept, isn't it? In today's Day and age, my

Speaker 2:          01:50:10       editor actually, it was a little nervous about my choice of title. I went through a bunch of titles for it. As I was writing it, he said, well, don't you think people are going to confuse it with you? And so the reason that meaning for enlightenment, the other meeting that I had in mind was the movement in the 18th century to apply reason to human betterment. The ideas of of hume and Adam Smith and the American founders like Jefferson and Madison and John Locke and Thomas Hobbes and the 17th and 18th century, and we said, look, if you know, if some people are confused and they think this is a path toward my book is going to be a path towards spiritual enlightenment. Well, let them buy the book. They might enjoy it anyway, but I went to the dictionary to see which of the two meetings was listed first and most of the dictionary is listed. The sense that I had in mind first, namely the movement in the 18th century toward greater reason is the spiritual distinction, right? Spiritual enlightenment is the one that people. That's right. And that's to be perfectly honest, that's not what the book is about. Uh, but you know, well, some people think it has made it. They'll buy the book by accident. Do you meditate? You know, I don't, but I think I should.

Speaker 2:          01:51:27       But you're such a smart guy. Like why would you, why would there be anything that I think you should do that you don't do it? It's a really good question because I'm not clearly, I'm not that smart. It's not bad. It's just a matter of like a practice and, you know, I think so. Yeah. And I did, uh, I was in a, uh, in, in Davos the week before last and was on a panel with a maturity cow. The French Buddhist monk who's a, who I see eye to eye with an a lot of matters. He wrote the forward to the French translation to the better angels of our nature and he had it. He had me in the whole room meditating and it was, yeah, I mean I liked it and I probably should do some orange. It's probably a benefit to it for now. Do you have any practices that you do do to try to sorta like keep your, your mind clean?

Speaker 2:          01:52:16       Like do you exercise regularly? I definitely exercise regularly and I'm a, I like exercise my, where the scenery goes by, so I don't, I tend not to hang around in gyms, but I like jogging, cycling, hiking, kayaking. Uh, I like a outdoor exercise and more aerobic than a um, than, than, than bodybuilding. Yeah, they say that's one of the best things for a cognitive function, a high intensity aerobic exercise that I like to think that, and I try to, uh, you know, sort of step back and exert some discipline on this. So social media email more, more than social media is trying to spend time with, uh, with my wife, Rebecca Goldstein of novelist and philosopher and we have a lot in common and it'd be kind of wasting life if I didn't get to, uh, you know, enjoy, enjoy time with her and she feels the same way.

Speaker 2:          01:53:14       She's also a workaholic. So we both are conscious of, you know, let's, let's get, go for a walk. Uh, you know, let, let, let's see, see some friends. Let's be close to our families. Do you have a goal when you're writing a book like this or is it just you, you have an interesting subject and just sort of follow it through? I always begin a book when I have, when I come across some really deep, exciting, interesting idea that I think has not been made public enough. Uh, so in the case of, of, uh, the better angels of our nature, it was the fact that all these measures, violence has been in historical decline and this is like a mind blowing fact. And I came across it by various historians, political scientists, psychologists that have sent me their data and I was of sitting on all these graphs showing the we're getting less violent and know, know about it.

Speaker 2:          01:54:10       So I wanted to, I thought I had an important story to tell and I had a big intellectual challenge. Namely, here I am, a psychologist. I, I, I like to think I understand how the mind works, but it's a big puzzle. Why were our ancestors so violent and how come more or less violent? We're kind of the same animals that we were a couple of hundred years ago. And likewise with the new book with enlightenment now, then I discovered that there was even more good news that if you look at other measures of human wellbeing like poverty, like illiteracy, like, um, number of work hours, uh, like disease, a graph after graph looks like we've made improvements, car safety, plane safety, workplace safety, pedestrian safety, death by fire, death by drowning. Almost all of them are going down. And so that was a story that I thought I was excited by it because, uh, uh, I, I knew that when people came across it, they would find it interesting and it was again, an intellectual challenge.

Speaker 2:          01:55:11       How do you explain it? And I attributed it to the enlightenment ideas. Do you encounter much resistance to this narrative from bloom people? Oh, you bet. Yeah. You know, and there are things that, that go wrong here. There's the opioid epidemic that's wrong direction. There's their big threats. There's always a possibility of nuclear war. And we've got to be really careful not to do anything stupid and to, in fact try to world walk the world back from nuclear weapons in the future. And climate change, um, and then there's some people who just don't believe it. They said, well, what about that? The terrorist attack yesterday? And I just say, well, you know, terrorism, they're kind of jerking us around the terrorists by doing an eensy weensy bit of violence. That gets a huge amount of publicity. So let's not let ourselves get jerked around by terrorists and rampage shooters.

Speaker 2:          01:56:02       Not give them so much publicity concentrate on where the deaths really are. Like in car accidents, like in ordinary homicides, like in opioid deaths. Let's look at the numbers and not get fooled by the headlines. But yeah, I do get resistance. We have obviously we have a massive reaction to any mass tragedy like a, a mass shooting or something along those lines, but that this is a natural thing, right? Because this just seems so strange that it could occur. It's a natural thing to have this reaction to this horrible tragedy, but we don't have a reaction to, you know, how many thousands of people die every day because of obesity. Obesity. Exactly. Or even if we concentrate on violence, we forget about, you know, the guy who shoots his wife because he, he, he thinks she's been flirting too much or the two guys who have a fight in a bar over who gets to use the pool table next and one of them is, is lying dead on the floor.

Speaker 2:          01:57:01       Uh, and these are, there are far more, uh, murders of that kind. Then there are terrorists killings every day. There are something like 25 of those, those homicides and uh, so it's like a sandy hill massacred day after day, after day after day. And they don't make the headlines because they occur, you know, bit by bit here and there. But it's still incredibly confusing to people when someone does do something like the vegas shooting, like what, what is this like? So I have a discussion of that just because it is such a puzzle and because it attracts so much attention and a lot of it is just the notoriety. These are often, not always, but they're often kind of nobody's and their life has gone, going down the toilet and they're thinking, well, how can I do something that makes my life meaningful, go out in a blaze of glory?

Speaker 2:          01:57:51       And so they think, what is the. In fact, I would ask you this question. Let's say you want to become, no, not you, you're already famous, but if I say to a typical person, what is the one thing you can do that's guaranteed to make you famous by tomorrow? The answer is kill a bunch of innocent people. And uh, you know, that's just a, a, a perverse fact about the world. And so for people where fame and meaning and mattering are more important than anything including life itself, we've kind of given this perverse opportunity to become a somebody, but because we just give them wall to wall news coverage. That's fascinating. Has there been an uptick in, in mass shootings and these sort of tragedies along with social media and more media in general? Probably a sum. And they do tend to be occurring in, in cycles there.

Speaker 2:          01:58:46       There's a copycat phenomenon. Yeah. Until people get a little bit bored and then it kind of dies down again. So there is that. And so there is a suggested policy. Uh, I actually signed onto this from some criminologists that the news media should not publish the names or the faces of mass killers, uh, that, uh, what's news? It may be newsworthy that had happened, but the particular name of the guy, wife, why is that newsworthy? The problem is it gets clicks. It gets click. You're right. There's so many articles that you see today that you, you look at the title of the article and it has very little to do with the actual article itself. It just because they come up mean this salacious headlines. They're just, they're so attractive. And it seems like today especially, you're seeing less and less people reading the Washington Post, the New York Times, the La Times, they're struggling.

Speaker 2:          01:59:41       And one of the ways they keep up is by giving people what they want. If it bleeds, it leads. If you know, who is this crazy asshole that shot 58 people, let's, let's find out what's going on in his life. It was his dad, who was this who says brother, exactly. And that is according to this, this movement. I mean it's, it's, it's a case that's not so innocent. It's not like the kind of click bait. You wouldn't believe what happened to the 19 seventies actress so and so. And the picture of her in her seventies if you know that kind of click bait, but this is click bait that does real harm. And there are other, you do have to balance it against, of course, freedom of the press. You don't want there to be, you know, governments to tell newspapers where they can publish.

Speaker 2:          02:00:21       But there have been some precedents where press has voluntarily impose some standards that do nothing to abrogate freedom of the press. But to make people better off. So I'll give you an example from sports. Uh, when the, the TV networks adopted a policy of not filming a fans that run onto the field, people stopped running onto the field because why do they do it? So they can say, you know, hi mom to be broadcast to 300 million TV sets. Of course, Canada had a policy of no longer publishing the names of juvenile killers and uh, you know, that was a voluntary restraint and it was socially responsible and I think there is something to be said for, for not giving rampage killers the audience that they seek. Hm. Yeah. I think that makes a lot of sense in terms of, uh, you know, the greater good of humanity, but if you're a newspaper guy and your, your, your business is just to sell newspapers, you're, you're a bottom line person.

Speaker 2:          02:01:22       That the whole thing is just to include, increase the amount of revenue that comes into your institution. Yeah. And, and, and not go bankrupt. Yeah. Especially today. Right. But you know, journalists especially in a mainstream forums like the, the major networks and CNN and the today and so on, they still have a huge readership and, and they do, they have, they have to look at themselves in the mirror. They do have journalistic codes of ethics. That's kind of one of the things that distinguishes them from the fake news and the rumor mills. And so, and that will always attract a large following. You, you want to be able to trust what you can read and so they've got a, I think, balance that against raw bottom line because if they lose their integrity than that's not so good for the bottom line in the long run either.

Speaker 1:          02:02:09       Do you think that there's. I wonder if there's room for new media today in terms of. I mean we obviously have these established places like the New York Times and like the Washington Post, but I wonder if that, these, these like, well respected, longstanding traditional venue that I wonder if that's really the right way to do it anymore.

Speaker 2:          02:02:36       Well, there has been a simultaneous with the kind of bottom feeders and the clickbait factories, there are a lot of really good new electronic magazines. No vocs and medium and Pacific Standard at Nautilus and Colette and Ian and uh, you know, there are others. So, uh, and, and a couple of decades earlier slate a new. These are really, really good and you often can read things that you're not going to find necessarily in the legacy papers. And they're responsible and they have fact checkers and they're, you know, they're not, they're not clickbait factories and so there is a, it's funny, almost inequality in an intelligent media where there's a lot of real crap at the bottom, but there's also a room at the top for, for new voices, when you look at a guy like the president,

Speaker 1:          02:03:25       the United States who loves to use that term fake news, so it's, it's one of the weirder times ever is his attacks on the media and it seems to be very similar to like the way he reacted to Barack Obama, mocking him during that speech, like the media, when they criticize him and critique him, his response is to completely attacked them and just say that they're useless and fake and it's. It's a weird time for, for news when it comes to that and for journalism.

Speaker 2:          02:04:00       No, I agree. It is a very disturbing phenomenon because there is a phenomenon of fake news, but fake news is not the same thing as coverage. That criticizes the precedent. Right? Exactly. An example of a real lack of comprehension of the, of how democracy works. Mainly if you're the president, you can be, will be, should be criticized, yes. How democracy works. We don't have a supreme divine leader that we consider it infallible and um, this event and that we bow down in front of it. Anything he says goes, he's temporarily kind of a steward. He's temporarily overseeing the government, but you know, he screws up and if he says something that's not true, the people have the right to criticism or criticized him and they better be that criticism. Otherwise we're going to get a, you know, a tyrant or a desk bought and, uh, taking any criticism and, and labeling it fake news, which is a real funnel problem. Fake news is a genuinely anti democratic impulse and it's really disturbing.

Speaker 1:          02:05:02       It is disturbing. It's also disturbing his attacks on the different intelligence agencies tax on a law enforcement. It's, it's real weird. It's weird. It's a real weird that you know it. If you boil it all down and you look at it like, well, what's going on? Oh, well, anyone, anyone that's after him, anyone that's attacking him, criticizing him, like the, these people get demeaned and he uses his influence and his power to kind of shut down all of these criticisms without any seemingly without any concern, for the longterm consequences of diminishing the impact of these media. A

Speaker 2:          02:05:39       really important point. Yeah. Again, this is a big theme of enlightenment now is what makes progress possible is that we have the institutions that are smarter than any of the flawed individuals that make it make it up, that we recognize it. We humans are, you know, what, what kind of smart, poor, not that smart and we all like to think that we're good and decent and wise, but no one of us in particular is that good and decent and yes, but we can set up rules and institutions that make the society as a whole better than any of the individuals that make it up. And democratic government is the prime example. And the whole, the difference between a democracy and as a cultive personality like Mao in China or Stalin in Russia, Hitler in Germany or uh, uh, Mugabe in Zimbabwe now, uh, or, or the Kim's in North Korea, is that we don't worship a supreme leader who kind of embodies the virtue of the people.

Speaker 2:          02:06:40       That's the idea that the United States tried to get away from the ideas. You got to procedure, you've got some rules, you gotTa, you know, you have to have someone making decisions but you kind of reign it in and it's not about him. It's about the whole system. And the fact that we've now got a leader who just doesn't really seem to understand that. He seems to think that it's all about him. And that if you just, you know, I alone consultant, you know, trust me, let me do it. And, uh, uh, the, the, all these rules and regulations are the deep state, the administrative state. Well, thank God for the deep state. The administrative state. It prevents some desk bought from foisting is cracked brain schemes on the whole population. We do need rules and bureaucrats and checks and balances as an oppressed. The can criticize the leader. As a psychologist, when you're looking at all this is, is this a fascinating study to you or is it terrifying? I guess? I guess some of each. I'd rather not be as fascinated, right, because ultimately you really don't want human psychology to be determining the fate of the world. You kind of want, or at least you want one product of human psychology, namely what we collectively irrationally agree upon to be embodied in a set of rules and procedures and so it's not about, you know, that guy.

Speaker 1:          02:07:59       There's also a way of behaving that we deem presidential and Barack Obama, in my opinion, embodied that better than anybody. He was very composed, like one of the most composed leaders ever in terms of leaders in the United States, like the way he would communicate and the way he would respond to criticism. He just had a very sort of composed a higher level of his ability to communicate is. It was just, it was very clean in a way.

Speaker 2:          02:08:30       I agree, and, and it was, it was a kind of a dignity and state street and yeah, and decorum and statesman and there's a reason for it. It isn't just that it makes you feel good when you see it, but it actually is making a statement, namely, it isn't about me. I'm occupying this office not to, not to prove what a big shot I am, what a genius, what a, a, uh, a glorious, Noble, divine figure I am. But I've got this big responsibility. I've got power to kill hundreds of millions of people or to make them better off or worse off. Uh, I take that seriously. Uh, it's not about me feeling really empowered is about me kind of serving the people that elected me. And that kind of self restraint and respect for the office is a way of reaffirming that principle of democracy.

Speaker 1:          02:09:23       What also concerns me is that the person who's in charge is. This is how a lot of the rest of the country views the nation itself. Like and if you have a person who's measured and objective and well thought out and well spoken and that when when you would hear especially Obama speeches, agree with them or disagree with him, everything was very clean, like the way he maybe I use the word clean too much, but it was, it was eloquent in. It was smarter than most people. You know, it was more more articulate than most people, you know, tho those, the way the sentences were formed were impressive in the intellectual capacity of the person that's delivering those words and so that made us feel better about who we were as a country. We're being led by this very wise, smart person. Whether you agree with his policies or not, there's no denying that this is a. it's an exceptional human.

Speaker 2:          02:10:28       I agree. And again, I think there's a greater reason behind it. To United States has the most powerful military. It's the richest country. The United States does matters to the rest of the world and to reassure the rest of the world that we're not just a bunch of cowboys who are going to do what's makes us the most powerful, but we really think about our role. We don't. We don't do rash things that could really be bad for the world. That gets conveyed symbolically in the way that a leader comports himself or herself.

Speaker 1:          02:11:00       Well, one of the things that I think of when I see this whole thing going down and I see also this a reaction to this president, like the giant women's March being called the women's March all day and it is a woman's march, but it's also a march against the president. I mean that's a big part of what this says. It's like the idea is that he is kind of against women in their eyes, whether it's correct or not, but that this March is to shorter sort of show solidarity that they disagree with the way things are going and I wonder if having a guy like this in power is going to, as we were talking about before, this sort of swing effect, gonna re reignite more people to be politically active and more people to do recognize the things that they don't like, like the calling the media fake news or like the attacks on the intelligence community. All these, these various things, these things that people deem to be racist is things that people deem to be hostile or or silly that he says and that there'll be some sort of a powerful reaction in response to that.

Speaker 2:          02:12:07       That is. That is. That is the hope. It's too soon to tell because there are two possibilities and one of them is that he's sort of shattered. Some norms created a precedent that means their successors could be even worse because norms can be fragile. Like what you just don't do. If you're president, well now you can do them. Right. That's the pessimistic view of the optimistic view is that the country will say, oh my God, look what we've been through. We try that. Let's get we, we, we, we tried crazy. Let's get back to sane. Right? Uh, so those, those are the two possibilities.

Speaker 1:          02:12:41       Um, you're out of time. Yes. Listen, thank you so much for being here. Your book. One more time. Enlightenment now. No reason. Science, humanism and progress. Thank you so much. It's been an honor and a pleasure. I really appreciate you being honest. Been Mine. Thank you so much, Joe. Thank you Steven Pinker, ladies and gentlemen. Bye.

Speaker 4:          02:13:01       Wow.
