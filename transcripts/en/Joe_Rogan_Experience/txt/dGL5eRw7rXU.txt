Speaker 1:          00:00:00       Straightening because nothing works properly. There are no good mobile phones. One, boom miles only been here for five minutes. We've already discussed cocaine, radical feminism, a radical progressive's that want to take over the world. Uh, prescription drugs, tight shirts. We've gone the full gamut. We have, we really have, and it's, it's fresh. It's young and fresh. We've already gone the full gamut. Um, I found out about you, uh, I guess it was so many, just, I, I get a lot of interesting stuff tweeted at me and, uh, I read one of your Breitbart pieces and I was like, check this motherfucker out. And then I found out that you're gay and you're, you're a part of this gamer gate, but you're in the game. You're on this, you were on the side of the people that were, uh, not the ultra progressive's like, and then you were in these debates against these radical feminism chicks and shutting them down.

Speaker 1:          00:00:55       And I was like, you were very kind about me. Play some video. Look at this motherfucker. You're a unicorn. Like they don't like people like you. I'm not supposed to exist into the progressive rules of the universe. I should not be. Yeah, you should. You're not supposed to be like fairly buttoned down and conservative and, and fare well also factually correct. Like all the stuff that you would, the thing that I'd seen, you've gotten in his argument about why certain women gravitate towards certain jobs and men gravitate towards jobs and this idea that, that a lot of this is just cultural. A lot of this is something that we're pushing upon young men and young women and you were like, well, this isn't the case at all. They're just hilarious to watch someone confronted by. Like they expect that to come from a me. They expected to come from some [inaudible] like I ought to be supporting the exact and on paper like paper, I should, you know what I mean? I'm a metropolitan. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:01:54       I'm, since I would be a liberal, I'm a homosexual. I listen. I'd like pop culture, you know, all of those things. I shouldn't really exist, but I do

Speaker 1:          00:02:02       for that one 10th of your tweets are about how fabulous your hair is. Yeah. So black, Greek, you know,

Speaker 2:          00:02:07       I of those things, any of those subjects, you know, his hair or you know, the men that I'm into, it's very, very difficult for them to beat me for one simple reason, which is they've never been questioned. I've never been called in any of this stuff by anybody's serious or anybody who's a, who doesn't conform to the progressive rules if identity politics. So when they come from me, they usual the usual response from a feminist to anybody bringing facts or accountants as serious counter argument is simply to dismiss them as a sexist or a bigot or a misogynist. It's really tough to make the allegation against me. I love women. All my friends are women. I don't have any, I don't have a dog in the fight sexually speaking. I don't care if I don't, I don't want to bang them, whatever size they are, however they behave. So they really don't, they don't have that over me. It's very, very difficult to come up against the guy that you cannot make a convincing argument, uh, of bigotry again. So you have to argue on the facts. And of course the facts are on my side. Well that's what the deal is. They dismiss

Speaker 1:          00:03:00       you instantaneously because of what you represent because what you represented like, well look, we got the dirt on him. He's, he's, he's gay and he's fabulous shit, what are we going to do?

Speaker 2:          00:03:14       But once you start, once you start to hit their radar, you note that you get calls from friends who say said this, this person I emailed me trying to check you out. This happened to me about a year ago. So I sort of hit an a journalist for 10 years. What are some good staff? Brooklyn's a big stories, but I never really, I never really kind of crossed over into entertainment into the mainstream and just started to happen about year ago and I started to get emails from friends and they were saying, I'm so what? What's going on here? People keep emailing me, asking me about you like trying to ask like in back in 2011 did he really do this? And what I've realized is when they, when they recognize you as a threat, when they identify you as somebody could do them damage, they start going on maneuvers, trying to find out everything about your, trying to find out what the worst stuff they have on you is so that he can dismiss you as a bigot or a sexist or a Neo Nazi or whatever.

Speaker 2:          00:03:57       They can come up with anything. They can grasp that because their strategy is to dismiss the, is to dismiss the speaker by attacking the speakers credibility. Because that way they never have to even consider the merits of the argument. They haven't been able to do that with me. Um, which is why feminists now refuse to beat me up, debate me on TV because they know they'll lose. Um, they can't bring out all, they can't bring out, they've got this battery of dismissing their dismissal tactics that they've amassed over the last 30 years and they've got so complacent because they've never had, you know, a Sassy gay person and come up and say it. You're talking bullshit and you're hurting men and here are the facts. They've never had it before, so they've never built up on arsenal to fight it. Um, you know, so this is, this is why I went and while Cook I'll keep winning because they don't really know how to deal with an argument on its own merits. And in any case, of course, the fact that we're on our so

Speaker 1:          00:04:42       well, it's also this conversation that we're having right now is about war. You're saying winning and losing and they're taking tactics and strategies to look up dirt on the opposition. They're going, they're treating. This is it. This is an ideological war is not a debate about the facts of the issue. And I think that's part of it because the left has always seen this as a war.

Speaker 2:          00:05:03       And the gender warriors, you know, have always been warriors. They've always seen this in strategic terms. I'm not sure people on conservatives and naturally more self effacing conservatives tend to be a little bit cool, a little bit more chill about things. They kind of don't

Speaker 1:          00:05:15       do you really draw it though? How do you explain tape? I think they get very angry about things. Explain Ted Cruz, what am I saying? Old Conservatives, but he explained, uh, what's her name? The Pailin chick. Sarah Palin. How to explain that. These are the, these are the outline is that Mike Huckabee, even most conservatives find these people a bit much. My car could be, I think that guy's in isn't in the end. Who knows how these cells fatter now he was hopping around last time. Well, I mean, you know, for like the lazy got that cushion TV gigs so far he got so far I cannot vote for anyone. That phenomenon of rock and rolling. I Want Marco Rubio just because he's hot. You know, if we call have Trump than I won't regret it. I don't think, I think people are silly. So whether or not it's a conservative thing or a liberal thing, I think there's a vast majority of people that aren't not

Speaker 3:          00:05:58       very good at looking at themselves and they're not very good at looking at the momentum of their actions. They just think that they're right because this is what they've been saying for so long. And I think that's one of the most horrific things about these conversations with these women. Get in with you about cause like when, when they're talking about what they think are social constructs, things like gender identities and the way people be. And when you shatter that with the facts, they're looking for some other weapons and there's nothing there and you see it in their eyes. You know, cause it's not really a debate about the idea itself. It's just not what, it's not what it's about is gender will fat. That's why people like Christina Hoff summers cold them gender warriors because these aren't people who want any kind of social justice as they say.

Speaker 3:          00:06:40       These are people who just hate men. Well, there's hate men. They want to hurt men. Um, they don't want to quality for women. They want to, they want superiority for women, whether it's architected into the education system or you know, affirmative action or whatever it is. They don't want quality. They want superiority. And fundamentally, a lot of this, you know, these, these crazy extremist, you know, uh, progressive third wave feminists, today's version of feminism. It basically boils down to messenger and it takes a gay guy because it's so dangerous for men to even broach this subject anymore. And any man with a mainstream job puts that at risk by even talking on the subject no matter what his opinion is. Um, it takes a gay guy to go on, you know, Sky News in the UK and say, I'm sorry, the facts are not on your side and what you're doing is damaging to women. Um, it's to me really an indictment on a, on debate in our public square that it is so dangerous for a man to even express an opinion on this subject, that it takes a fact they're going to stick up for heterosexuals.

Speaker 3:          00:07:33       And you know, if other men could say this, they would be, but they can't because they would run the risk of their careers. What feminists always talking about silencing people icy silence to men. Well that, that is true. There's a lot of doxing and going after people and a lot of, a lot of anger when it comes to all this stuff. But I think what you have in many cases when you see this kind of like disjointed, illogical sort of way of thinking, I think you have people that are assholes that find a cause that gives him the green light to be an asshole. Well, I've written about this, you know, I agree with you. I think, no disrespect to any particular church, but I think it's reasonable to say 50 years ago if you were a bully, if you are a sociopath, do you want us to take out in other people?

Speaker 3:          00:08:13       You want it to Rick harm on the world that you thought would hurt you? Reasonably good way of doing that would be to join the clergy and many and many people did. And I think most of us who are religious, who have religious families know stories like that. These days, you're better off getting a job at Gorka. Um, you know, if you want to bully somebody, if you really want to hurt them, if you have some sort of internal chaos or damage and you want to impose order on the world outside because you feel so confused and broken and messy, uh, the best way to do it today, it's become a social justice warrior. Because not only do you get the same kind of status in society the clergy would have done 50 years ago, but you also get media platforms. You get money, you get approval, you get applause. And if you layer on these new tactics of, you know, fake abuse and fake Harrison, and you know, these terrible man, you know, these terrible men coming for me on the Internet, see if you can make quite a lot

Speaker 2:          00:08:56       of money too. Yeah, you can form a patrion page and then people just sending the audio. What is that? It's like, it's like a crowd fund me for my ideas. Right? So in the, in the old days you'd have patrons of the arts and there would be, you know, like a prince or some rich guy or maybe the, uh, maybe a little later in history it would be a mercantile patron. And in the way, in the way that, um, many industrialists and bankers still give a lot of money to their local opera house or something like that. So patch on is a way of turning that open into crowdfunding. So your, your patron becomes a load of people, all of whom give you a little bit of money. Right. So it's, it's in theory quite a respectable and interesting way of funding the outs. In principle, there's nothing wrong with it, but it seems to become colonized by people who are raising money on the basis of sympathy rather than anything they actually create.

Speaker 2:          00:09:46       So it's what I've, what I've noticed in my reporting on this is the vast majority of people begging for money on Pantry on as far as I can tell, I'm sure Patrick and will tell me, you know, most of them went on their platform, goes creative projects. But as far as I can tell, it's, you know, people bleating for sympathy, you know, fishing for empathy. It's a, there's a lot of women on there claiming to be, you know, claiming that their lives are being ruined by manual. Actually look into it. I can't find the tweets are talking about, um, you know, and it's, and it's a way for, there's this, there's this great tweet by, um, what's an airport who is ochre gamergate supporter. And I can't, I'm going to remember it wrongly, but it's something along the lines of, you know, every day on the Internet, some goonie beard man, uh, you know, promises to be nice to a social justice warrior in the hope of a wink or the hope of a blow job or something like that.

Speaker 2:          00:10:30       You know, and it's, it's these guys who were just sort of throw a fiver or throw a tenner a month, you know, $20 a month to this video games developer who's never produced anything in her life, but claims she's getting harassed and claims are getting threats. It's very, very weird, um, psychological dynamic. And I think it's, I think it's quite, it's, it's, it's interwoven with the way that feminism has turned women into professional victims, handed them this victim hood script. And most of these women are not really to blame. They're not kind of, these aren't, these aren't horrible sociopathic, you know? Warmongers these aren't people who really hate man. They're just a bit miserable and they've reached for the nearest victim hood script available to them because we live in a culture where, you know, a victim hood is the, is the most valuable currency that you can, um, but you can amass.

Speaker 2:          00:11:12       And, um, and so they go out, they advertise what a terrible life they have and how awful people ask them on the Internet. And they ask men, mainly it's women asking for money from men. Um, you know, effectively for sympathy dollars. It's incredibly demeaning. It's incredibly, you know, to the human spirit, you know, aside from anything else, you know, you're basically telling these women that they have more value as winches and liars and gender warriors than they do as creators or mothers. Um, and I find that hugely destructive. I think that what we're, we're, we're talking about as far as like people that are assholes that just launch off, latch onto a cause. And then that if you go to their page, like there's, there's so many of them that write and you'd go

Speaker 3:          00:11:54       to their blog and their blog is just an attack blog. Yeah. It's just consistent attacks on people that don't share their ideas or don't or have differing ideas of coined a term for this. What is it? I've coined sentence quantum superstate feminism and it is an, it is feminism that exists at once as aggressor and victim. It is simultaneously and at all times aggressor and victim. And it's describes these women who go out lobbing shit at people, uh, and then instantly turned into damsels in distress when they, when they see their own language returned in kind, you know, quite often returned at greater volume because what they're saying is ridiculous and offensive and people get annoyed about it perfectly. Reasonably. And also, if you create an environment in which it's fine to say anything you want about man, it's fine to say kill white men.

Speaker 3:          00:12:37       It's fine to publish articles in, you know, in, in mainstream news media publications about how to hurt man and all the rest of it. Just sort of several years ago, who was just the woman recently, the Google ideas woman that had the tweet about, uh, she eats men for breakfast. This is, I think he's talking about Randy Harper. If you imagine if a guy wrote that down, I eat women for Breck. What unit? Do you know? Some men do speak to women like that? Some of the men's rights activists on Twitter? Well, yes, but do you know why men's rights activists are so rude to women because they're assholes? Well, know what they're doing. It women have for 30 years said, treat us like men were just like, man, we're just the same. Treat us like men. We can do anything that men can do. You can do everything that men can do.

Speaker 3:          00:13:19       Men's rights activists just take them at their word and the weight and taunting is how many bombs, you know, that's not what they're doing, how they're doing. And they're not trying to bond with these women. They're trying to hurt them. Well I think what they're doing is taking it, taking it at face value, this demand for, for us to treat women. I see us for them to treat women. Um, you know, uh, just just like they would their buddies down the pub. Well if you ever actually been to a pub when you were hearing men like outplaying pain sneaker or whatever, their fucking awful to each other. But I think they're doing exactly the same thing. They don't want these women doing. Everyone's just being a cunt. They just like take away the gender. It's a, men are being conscious, women are being cons. People are reaching through these internet lines turn to hurt each other.

Speaker 3:          00:14:00       That's what they're doing. I think it's true and I'm not, I'm not totally on board with a whole men, men in [inaudible] men's rights for a second. I think anybody who spends so much time working on their like approval of their own gender, like w w we're supporting our own gender. Like there's a lot of dudes that are pieces of shit. There's a lot of women that are assholes. It's just, I think part of the problem is that they sort of become feminists in reverse and they use the same tactics. They like to show large police. They also, I mean it's amazing. You go on some of these communities in Reddit and you read some of these blogs and they're sort of, you know, they're like fainting couch men's rights activists. You know, if I have a friend Julie Bentall, who's very, very funny, she's a lesbian, she's, yeah, she's basically this dike feminist.

Speaker 3:          00:14:38       She hates men. She made this joke and it's kind of like the sort of joke I would make. She said, you know, we should put all men and internment camps. You know, they could, they can have visitation once a month, we'll have guards and they could just stay in camps until they learn how to behave. If I'd said that about women, the whole is fear as it were, would be like applauding. They think it was hilarious, but because she said it in a similar level of jest, you know, suddenly it was just disgusting, outrageous thing. You know, feminists has, men should be put in concentration camps. And I was like, bitches really? Are you fucking kidding me? This is exactly what feminists do. You are taking a joke like it, you're taking a joke, you're pretending to take it seriously, and then you're starting an outrage circus about it.

Speaker 3:          00:15:16       And I was like, for fuck's sake, I am out. It's recreational outrage. It is what it is. Isn't that, isn't that what this is supposed to be like fighting against, you know, I'm in this because I'm like a cultural libertarian as my colleague Alan Bakari puts it. Um, you know, I believe in classical liberalism, freedom of speech, freedom of thought, freedom of expression. You know, I don't care what you believe, I just want you to have, I want, I want to be able to interrogate your ideas in the public square. Um, but yeah, this outrage circus that so many men seem to be getting involved in and the way they treat, you know, they call, they call circumcision male genital mutilation. And I'm like, wait a minute, isn't it? You're, you're coming, you're, you're, uh, you're, uh, you're one of those, but no, I'm just saying, I mean, it is, look, I'm going to write it's cutting skin while I'm in favor of it purely on aesthetic grounds.

Speaker 3:          00:16:01       I understand that these things in my mouth. Okay. I can understand from your point of view, I can understand that your baby should be able to make a decision on later in life. No, no. I, I haven't, I haven't, but if you have a view, I know lots of men don't like on this issue and it's simply that, you know, it's just good grooming. Frankly. Women, women go on, women go onto, I'm serious. Women go on to the ninth. I have boob jobs and all the rest of it. Why stop penises? Attractive, sexy procedure that comes close to the numbers of babies that gets circumcised. That's done. The female girl, one of these people. I mean, I just like birth as they're just weird, but I think I'm in the minority here. I'm sorry, I'm sorry to offend you, but I think I'm in the minority here, but I just can't imagine why any man wouldn't want lots and lots of really good blow jobs because, well, apparently it feels better when the skin is on or no, no, it's so much.

Speaker 3:          00:16:55       How do you know unless you've done both? What? Because I've got feedback from, I've, I've a, it's all anecdotal evidence this way off. I've got a large sample size. You just liked the way they look better when it's all trimmed up nice. Every other woman, which is telling you to choice based a lot on what we're used to having it done later in life. It's not nice if you're fucking dumb enough to get your Dick's getting cut off when you're 30 I hope. I hope it hurts the camaraderie on this. You don't have to suck one of these things. Okay. That's all I'm going to say. We should leave it there. I wouldn't have liked to believe that I have the same approach that I do to vaginas. Like if a girl at a big vagina lips, I wouldn't say d. You know, he shouldn't have kept that shit cut off. I think bit what it looks now. It's horrifying. No, we'll leave it there. That's what it is. It is what it is. Big nipples like, do you gonna get them shrunk down? That's fucking barbaric. I don't know about the mind, you know? Well, it's interesting.

Speaker 1:          00:17:50       No, I mean I there it, you know, there people aren't scrupulously cutting babies. Dick's is stupid. God Sake. It's a baby's Dick. You don't have to cut his deck. I mean, you know how many kids lose their dicks every year because of infections and because of the surgery goes wrong? A lot can't win. If you're going to take this view, if you're going to take this line like cutting babies, Dick's, I can't win. I can't win against that one's a surgical procedure. I'm happy to be in the minority on this one. Pleasing surgical procedure. You know what? All you might be cutting all you motherfuckers out there. He would want to keep you full scan. Right? I'm going to, I'm going to get, I'm going to give these world class blow jobs to the juice instead. Congratulations on your worldclass blow jobs. My favorite story was my least favorite story, but when my favorite story to bring up was oil in New York who had herpes and when they, when they cut the baby's Dick in the traditional way, they actually suck on the baby's penis to stop the bleeding.

Speaker 1:          00:18:45       Have you ever seen this? I've ever heard articles about this. Yes, I have. Yes. And the kid died cause a, the kid got herpes from the rabbi, the oil, whatever the fuck his name is. What a great idea. Cut and baby dicks could have grown up to solve cancer or one of those things. Either one of them can be awesome. Meanwhile, nope. Dead Baby. Well, I don't think anyone's going to disagree with you on that particular incident. Don't cut baby dicks, but they'll have the fuck did we get on? I don't know. But it was inevitable. I mean, you know, look, there's absolutely a bunch of horrible shit that happens to women on a daily basis. I mean, every time you see these fucking Cosby stories, these women that are coming out of nowhere about bill Cosby, when, when, when women talk about worrying about being drugged, and if you don't know anybody that's actually happened to, or someone close to you that's actually happened to, that danger doesn't seem real. So when you, but you see this bill Cosby thing and you're like, not only is it real, it's like, here's the guy that was America's, his voice, the voice of Morality for a generation.

Speaker 2:          00:19:55       Um, this becomes such a mania, a moral panic, like a moral panics in history about this stuff that the genuine victims are starting to, to be disbelieved. And this is driven by, I'm sorry to say, kind of the sort of progressive narrative over fat kind of journalism. Sabrina Erdely and rolling stone and all these rapes we hear about, they all seem to unravel within a couple of months.

Speaker 1:          00:20:15       Is that was the rolling stone was Uva. Yeah. Which didn't have the virtuous girl at Columbia didn't happen. A Jute Lacrosse didn't happen. Yeah. You know, all these things have happened. Well, yes, but we should, we should

Speaker 2:          00:20:29       be. We should be working at how to solve and prevent these crimes better. And the waste you that is not to erect. It is not to stage a moral panic in the media, um, pointing fingers at innocent people. And when you see, when you as was clearly the case with rolling stone, sort of sweep under the carpet facts or omissions that, that, that doubt on your story because you think this is just something we should be talking about anyway. Whether this specific case, whether we have the details right, this specific case, what happens is when all of it, when these rape stories or whatever it is, um, get ripped, get, uh, success is successive rape stories get repudiated and debunked. It undermines confidence and trust in anyone who makes that complaint. Anyone who says this happened to me right in the back of their head.

Speaker 2:          00:21:12       I think perfectly reasonably, people are thinking, oh man, another one. Um, you know, it's not a nice thing, but this is what this is. This can be the effect of a moral panic in the media. It, it damages the real victims, um, the most. And that's, you know, that's why I've written about this stuff in the past. I think it's also why it's really important to tell the truth about statistics. Now, feminists are always have a, they have a complicated relationship with the truth. Um, one is the one in four week. Exactly. I mean this goes all the way up to Obama. Every time you hear it seems to get worse, you know, but I think we extrapolate out it's going to be like 50 women in five gets raped within a second of stepping on campus by 2025. Um, you know, it gets worse every time.

Speaker 2:          00:21:48       It's based on ridiculous studies. I mean the, the way I started I think Christina Hoff Summers at the American Enterprise Institute who I was site cause she's so fantastic. Um, and so when other Unicorn, so on point of March is feminist feminist lever and she, you know, she just had some problems with um, with contemporary feminism and gender warriors. Um, you know, she, she does a great series of the factual feminist. I'm sure a lot of your viewers are already, um, but, uh, you know, she, she sort of tracked down the original study for this, which was, you know, samples has about 70 people and an adult education college, which is so eight to so completely alien in character. I mean, these people are like 20 years older, you know, and of course there's, you know, adult education cultures, you know, there, there, there are different, there is a different set of social issues that go along with adult education college then, then 20 year olds Undergrad, you know, what do you call them?

Speaker 2:          00:22:33       Freshmen, uh, you know, [inaudible] doing a regular degree in college. I'm sample size was ridiculous. The university was atypical and this has been extrapolated out to this, to this feminist myth that just won't die. Like, but like the gender pay gap as well, how they define like, there's people that want definition sexually, but there's actually a section of sexual assault and sexual abuse has been broadened so widely. What's getting crazy regret in some universities? Um, it is part of the university's conduct code that unwanted sexual advances. That means me saying, you're really pretty, can I buy you a drink? Constitutes sexual harassment. Now this is just, you know, you're gonna have to close down every nightclub in the country. Um, it's just extraordinary bonkers. Um, you know, crazy stuff. And this is, you know, 30 years unchallenged feminism, which is why I do what I do, because I think it matters.

Speaker 2:          00:23:21       I think it's important. I talked to Guy, he's 20 years old, you know, our age, right? Um, I don't know how old you are, I guess, you know, you're 48. Okay, fine. So I mean, like, you know, you're, you're maybe my dad's almost at my dad's generation, but anyone your age, even right down to my age, I'm 30. It would have been a bit ridiculous for us to say that, you know, society is architected against men. You know, when we were growing up, it just wasn't the case. And there's no point trying to pretend that it was. But I speak to boys all the time and I've interviewed, you know, so many of them now have about 20, who do go through life experiencing this extraordinary, um, uh, sort of, uh, architecture, you know, against them, whether it's being, you know, wax on Adderall at school or more women, you know, getting into university for no good reason or women as in a Cornell to 2015 studies show that women have to two to one advantage going for a stem job in academia.

Speaker 2:          00:24:04       Um, so being discriminated against because they don't have a vagina. Um, 20 year old boys do have some serious problems now. Um, and we, you know, we risk not just one, but many lost generations of boys. I call this this exodus or a big two-parter about this that I think, I think a lot of people were very nice about, um, seem to go down very well. Um, yeah, there's some really serious stuff to address, which is why I do one of the reasons I do what I do because I, you know, I think that's what journalism is supposed to be for. You know, speaking up for, for people who don't have a platform themselves and for, um, you know, so the, the establishment has lost, uh, lost sight of and it doesn't care about anymore. That's why I think it's important to tell the truth about statistics.

Speaker 2:          00:24:36       You can't help victims if you lie, but in your first sentence about what the problem is and there is not a, you know, a systemic problematic gender pay gap in the United States or in Europe. There is not a, um, uh, an epidemic of rape culture on campus. There is not, you know, a problem in universities or, uh, with not enough women going into stem into science, technology or mathematics subjects. All of these things are so subtle and sophisticated explanations that, you know, when you were taken to account human nature and the different choices people make and what women want to do, um, you realize that this stuff is bunk, but many of these myths simply won't die. Well, you also have to take into consideration there's a bunch of other variables, right? Like women leaving because they have children and you have to factor that in to the amount of income you can generate gap.

Speaker 2:          00:25:25       This stuff, this stuff is based on a misunderstanding between earnings and pay. You can't take all the men in society and all the, we're going to get in society and do like a two, two stage calculation and said, right, well there's 77% as much money on this side. Right? Right. That's not what people mean when they say there's a page where you say that it's the way you tell it to say something. There's a wage gap. What what they think you mean is women get paid 77 cents on the dollar. Do you know if that's the phrase they use to a man's right, implying that women get paid less for the same work. That's the implication that they're making through all of this cause they're confusing earnings with wages, right? Um, earnings with pay. What actually happens is men work longer hours. Men take, even when you control for children, men take fewer, fewer holidays.

Speaker 2:          00:26:02       They take shorter holidays, they work longer hours, they make more money for their firms. All the rest of it may just work harder. Um, they have longer careers, et Cetera, et cetera. Um, women prefer whether or not they have children to have a more balanced life. They prefer not to work full time that I have to work part time. They, you know, have more of a rash generalizations because of course it was on both sides. We all know lazy, Lazy, this is the way the left dog or is that not all women are giving me a break, you know, but you know what I'm saying, but speak in generalizations if you've got to communicate how to do that because you know, there are, I mean I think the term is to test Stickley. There are more men that are working longer hours that are working harder, that generate more money. But to say like, men do that well, we all know lazy fucks it just with the man we do

Speaker 3:          00:26:44       it. Is that, um, the reason I phrase it exactly like that is that I don't want to, you know, let's not open up the, you know, this whole, not all men stuff that the left and right, because that's the, that's that's the, that's the, um, that is the route into this sort of social conditioning argument. Yeah. Just objective. Well, what I'm trying to, what the point I'm trying to make is that men, generally men, men generally have the following traits, right. And this is reflected in employment and you have those traits. But I mean, you know, we've got to come to the lazy lazy men. Uh, yeah, sure. I'm there. There are some lazy men, but there were also men dropping out of society because of, you know, because, uh, they feel that there's just no place for them anymore. You know, they've had their, what they consider to be their role in the family, um, snatched away from them that I'll was the last two generations real issue.

Speaker 3:          00:27:30       Yeah. Well, again, I think your generation is, my generation sounds ridiculous, but I speak to 20 year old boys all the time who are saying, I can't be bothered with women. You know, there's this movement and midtown men going their own way. They're, they're actually, she fuck is involved. Will you say that? But there's a lot of guys know you say that 10 years, 10 years ago we took about five days later, 10 years, 10 years ago. Uh, sure. But today the numbers are below the blossoming, that blossoming. It was so fast. And you know, the thing is men deal reasonably well without women. They don't like to do it. Look, people who people like us are not going to want for sex, right? Um, because we're outgoing and ballsy and brash and self confident, all the rest of it, right? Uh, we're not going to have it too much of a problem, but there are plenty of men who don't have our self confidence and who are being bullied and derided and ridiculed everyday in the media at this stuff gets you people get depressed about this stuff.

Speaker 3:          00:28:22       This is the male suicide epidemic. You know, this is a huge epidemic across the board. No, that, well, the number, the number, the number of female suicides. I mean it's different statistics, different countries. It's a different slightly, but you know, the female numbers aren't really changing. Women are getting more unhappy a decade after decade, but they don't actually commit suicide. They never go through with it. When they try, they fail. They can't even commit suicide probably there four to seven covenant. They kind of a killed themselves properly. They're forcing the men to kill themselves. Well, they often, well we've women often road, we went off and write the suicide notes and then they try to kill themselves and they fail or they call they or they bottle it at the last minute and call. Someone said up taking some pills. They never, they never ended up dead.

Speaker 3:          00:29:03       Uh, but men just, you know, go quiet for a few days and then they just hang themselves. Um, but those, those numbers are going up. The number of men who were just giving up some relationships, that number is going up. I can't believe that. See, because then you're factoring in you this kind of like, you know, swolled media star where he hangs out with, you know, good looking, fashionable people all got girlfriends, you know, banging, banging our girls. Um, it's not, it's not, it's, sorry, I just had a moment then. Uh, no, it's not your womb while married kids. Yeah, yeah. Whatever. I don't need to know what you get up to. Um, but yeah, I know what you're saying. This is not the case. There's going to be no, no, it's not some unhappy people. This is not just cancer filings of men out there by themselves just alone.

Speaker 3:          00:29:47       Just giving up. You should, uh, you should pay more attention. You should listen to them when they're speaking to you because they need people like you. Come on, man. This is a small metal really down to me. Is it going to be this fucking British queer who's going to stick up for these guys when even you won't stick up? Kick off these drive out as society, man, man's radio host and these guys, God, what am I camp outside? No cell phone. This is a fucking man. That's why I have the fucking media beating down my door. Because even you guys won't stick up for men anymore. You can't just coddle them like that. If they really want to draw what groups to hoard with girls. Dude, you can. I'm a total sociopath, but I still preach a little sympathy on this issue. How dare you.

Speaker 3:          00:30:35       But no, I'm not. But um, women, the feminist, we'll call you that. All right. Well I think has some terrible thing, especially where the male feminists, but trying to get Brownie points. Oh, warm honey of the, Oh, the war. Male feminists do their Twitter profile and, but I usually don't write male feminists. They're just feminists. Just feminist. And I'm like, Oh God, how long has it been? How long does it, they just want to, I want to ask them how long has it been? Like two months. And I'm like, no, no. How long has it been? Two years. That's it. That's why you're a feminist. But this is what they don't understand is the kind of women they're sucking up to. Don't even want them. No. Women don't want men to speak about feminists. If they don't want allies because no man is ever going to be good enough to speak about women's issues is the crux of identity politics.

Speaker 3:          00:31:21       Modern feminists don't want men, they hate man. Stop sucking up to them. The only way you're going to get them is to connect them. The only way you're going to get them is to say you are a ridiculous fucking whore and I'm paying you no attention whatsoever and that's how you get them. Well, it's worked for me. It works that way. Okay, maybe not that language, but you know you're addicted. You're ridiculous woman. I'm paying no attention whatsoever. And that key second part of the phrase was what I was really focusing on that second part of that phrase. That's what makes him come running. Being shuttled games like a Turkey. You got to know her, right? No one to make the hand because I don't have skin in the game. You see? So I'm able to analyze these things just passionately. Well, there's some truth to that.

Speaker 3:          00:31:59       Certainly. There's definitely some truth to wise gate uncle, you know who can just sort of from a distance can tell you what's it telling you, what's going, what's happening. It's just pathetic to watch those poor men grovel. Grovel for Social Brownie points. Yes it is. And they're never going to get the hand job. I'll get, it's not going to happen, but it's even that they can't see that it's not about feminism. It's not about masculinism either, if that's a word. It's about people not being full of Shit, you know, not crying victim when you're not really a victim. Not pulling the fucking fire alarm on a Pr Guy who's a that Toronto thing where the, the guy was, they totally misrepresented the position of his book, misrepresented what his position was on women period and on men. And he was just essentially trying to highlight, some men have and they were calling them just, they call me.

Speaker 3:          00:32:58       I quite like getting insults because I'd like to, I'd like to rate them. I get them marks out of 10 and then I come back to the troll and I explained how they could've made it better. How they could improve, you know, so I like to take my tape to troll school. And you know, sometimes people send you good things like go take up off of the toaster, which is quite funny. Like, I like that. That's a good one. More people [inaudible] they just didn't circuit breaker. Well I liked to joke anyway. And then sometimes it's just, you know, you deserve to die two out of 10, you know, come on, you can do better. Um, if this is what they do and this is what they do, they are, they are, you know, the insults and ridicule and demean and tried to discredit the speaker.

Speaker 3:          00:33:31       And if they can't do that, they will do some other kind of silencing of no platforming and whatever. So those opinions can never be, you know, they do not want those opinions ever aired in public because those opinions and the facts that underpin them, um, the reasoning that underpins them, which is what people go to these talks to here is so dangerous to feminist narrative, which is basically, you know, based on, on feeling and not fact based on, um, you know, bigotry and Kloss and gender hatred, not any kind of sensible analysis. The way the world works. I've got so many invitations to universities for the next six months, and you know, this isn't an advertisement, 20 feminists listening, but I know this is going to happen. Um, and you know, the talks go on anyway, it just takes, takes up a whole day of your life instead of an afternoon.

Speaker 3:          00:34:11       But, you know, I know it's going to happen. I've got talk, I'm, you know, I'm going, I'm speaking at Universum swings at USC a Republican's next week. I'm speaking, um, you know, to a bunch of UK and US universities over the next six months. And I just know what's coming, you know, and it's, it's this extraordinary like a homeless gay dude. You know, I cracked Dick Jokes on Twitter and I do Sky News now and again. And if, you know, if I'm, if I'm like the scariest opponent, you know, that they have, they've got real problems. Um, but you are, because of what we highlighted earlier, they can't dismiss it is semi joking, all that shit. It's like, you know, semi joking but I'm not kind of a game and make your argument for God's sake. And why is it that for the last 30 years they have been incapable or unwilling of actually making an argument and instead they do everything they can to simply get the speaker out of the public eye.

Speaker 3:          00:34:54       Well, because they exist in an echo chamber. I mean, I think that the, the forums that they go to, the Twitter groups that they, I've gone to people's pages cause I find out they're ridiculous. I read, I read an article about this page and went to his Twitter page and I was already blocked. I'd never even interacted with block lists. You want a boat, you're on a block list is probably cause you following me. I seem to be, I seem to like sort of Voldemort for these guys. Just had a few controversial things myself. It might just be thinking about saying what's wasn't as controversial thing. If it was at Tommy fucking, I will take a long time. We'd have to get me through the Internet. Uh, what kind of say that? You're saying if you are, if you're a man, you call yourself a feminist.

Speaker 3:          00:35:32       I hope you choke to death on Vegan Pizza. Why crying to a lady Gaga Song is that she upset with me. Variable. Is that controversial? Yes. Is it talking about death? Oh, okay. I prefer they get raped with wow. Male rape is not as bad as female rape though. Right. You could say like male rape to the pizza. It doesn't seem as awful. It's funny, some of us go out and search with male rape. That's a comical thing to say though. A man being raped by a pizza. Whereas if a woman gets raped by pizza, it's just funny. It's just so nuts. Not well. You see hard to, I'll tell you what, I liked it. I liked that. I liked that you find it horrible because it shows to me that chivalry is not dead and you have a decent respect for, you know, for, for, for women and for speaking about women properly.

Speaker 3:          00:36:20       And I like that you're offended by what offended because I like that you find it distasteful to speak of women in that way because it speaks well of you. Um, I think what feminism is done, I think what feminism has done is made it very difficult to be nice about women because the critic, this environment where there's so much hate and bile and ridiculed men, men feel like they've got to respond in kind or just check out entirely and it's, it's this, that's what I don't buy. I think you have a very small minority are not very attractive who get really upset at men. And I have a theory about sociological shit when it comes to these really radical anti male feminists. A lot of it is a constant state of rejection, but these disproportionate effect, what's on these, these ugly women who, by the way, there are all sorts of studies which I love, which show the ugly women are much more likely to be liberals.

Speaker 3:          00:37:09       Um, and of course they make sense for all the reasons you would imagine. Um, so they find feminism or perhaps they start losing their looks in their thirties. So they did. They, um, you know, slide back into feminism. Yeah, no, women are gone at 30 on that. I, I'm, I'm, I'm, I like, I like sex. I'm the tip of gates that take, you know, all my eight 30 and I like to start requesting things in their forties. A lot of times they'll leave and go to yoga, but what the statistics show is that, um, women, uh, in their thirties, if they're still single stock a bit nuts, they report themselves as being generally more unhappy with life, more likely to have contemplated suicide, like pressed, uh, men considered retreat into point of video games. But women get women, women go nuts if they're single in their thirties.

Speaker 3:          00:37:53       So thanks. Feminism, right? So it's all women. You see, you, you don't know you it so much ground already by allowing yourself to be taken over by this leftist clap around, just being objective since we speak. It's it, it's a soft quantify. When you say like, you know, women are x, you mean most people next is, it is understood that you speaking in generalities, it's annoying to women that aren't like that telling like shit, get over it. It is understood that you're speaking generalities without general assays. It's impossible to communicate. It's a British thing, British thing. It's just a not being nit picky. Dick, there's a simple addition to that sentence. See, well understood there. When you say are many men who have gold,

Speaker 1:          00:38:36       men are leaving language policing. You've given it, you've given it over already. You have a language policing your halfway to feminism. I had a buddy come in for a long time and he was ugly. And um, because he end, he used to get rejected all the time and he started getting really fucking angry. And as he got older we had to stop hanging out with them because he would, you know, he would meet girls who've tried to hit on them. They would say no, and you're like, fucking lesbians. He's fucking cunt lessons and just work out or funny or get money. I mean, it's any man can do at least one of those three. Anyone can walk out, anyone can learn to be funny. During that process, during that process, you still have sexual needs. So he, he had not accomplished any of those goals. So he was not, would not attractive to these women. And because he wasn't attracted these women I witnessed over the course of knowing him for several years, I witnessed this massage Negro inside of him. And it was based on the interactions that he had with women that were all negative, the interactions he had with women. He came away feeling bad about himself, feeling rejected. And so he started to project that they were the root cause of this issue. I had to seek. You're dealing with a lot of the same phone as feminists.

Speaker 2:          00:39:50       Problem is that society has been architected in such a way that those, those outcomes, those rejections are now not just the norm, but almost enforced by a woman's need to reject a man and to see, you know, look at this stuff, you know, unwanted advances, sexual Harrison, basically what it means,

Speaker 1:          00:40:05       it's tough, but those are the monsters, the monster women who are trying to push that they're so small. It's such a small percentage.

Speaker 2:          00:40:12       You grossly underestimate the influence these people have on not just debate in the media, but on policy and universities and even the government. Look at California. Yes means yes. Affirmative consent laws. This stuff becomes law. It doesn't California roll and when it, when it starts in California, it's spreads elsewhere. Every unit, every, every big American University has a ridiculous code of conduct that's got this stuff embedded in it. And it comes from the, you know that, yes, it comes from the crazies. I admit, I willingly admit that most of them were wonderful and they don't buy into this shit. And indeed of course in just what does it in just two years from 28% of women, down to 18% of them identify as feminist. Fewer than one in five women call themselves feminists because they see what we see, which is that these feminists are all misaddressed lesbian, manic, crazy people, fine.

Speaker 2:          00:40:56       But those messengers lesbian at crazy people are effecting laws in this country and in my country. They're effecting conduct codes of conduct, the university that dictate a man's entire future and a woman's entire future for that matter and their happiness and good sexual health and, and the that you know, at the destination of the species, the way that men and women interact with each other's becoming poisoned by these people. You grotesquely underestimate their influence. If you write, write them off as a few mad crazies in student unions, but they have gigantic purchase on, on the media and therefore on politician.

Speaker 1:          00:41:28       Well, they certainly do when it comes to schools in schools to be repeating the lots of huge issue for, for

Speaker 2:          00:41:34       women getting, getting a sexually assaulted on campus. Listen though, your president is parroting these myths from these pieces. Yes. Obama has repeated the, the sexual harassment myth. Obama has also repeated the wage gap myth. You've dismissing these people are sort of powerless fringe crazies. The president of the United States is repeating their talking points. Don't tell me these people aren't influential. It's nuts. Well, that's a different thing, isn't it? I mean, when the president, the president is really just a guy who supposed to parrot what everybody else sort of already believes anyway. And if that's what the progressive democratic person, I don't know if a republican president would be any different, they'll be a lot more Jesus talk. What else would be different? Would tell the truth. Trump would tell the truth. Do you really like Trump or it's a troll not accusing me of trolling. What a horrible allegations.

Speaker 2:          00:42:23       That's, that's a, that's a, that's a horrible whole remark to make. Um, you know, I really, I do really like him. Uh, do I really want them in the White House? You can fill in the gap today, but, uh, but I love him. I want to in the race for as long as possible. Look, he taps into you and I both, um, you know, obviously I don't have a fraction of your, um, you know, uh, reaching an extraordinary audience and fans. But we're both in our own ways kind of counter cultural figures and very popular counter cultural figures. And I think that you may not like this, but I think Trump taps into a similar vein of frustration and suspicion and hatred of the establishment of the political media classes. I think you and I both benefit from culture to the tonight, both benefit from some of the same instincts that make people quite like Trump.

Speaker 2:          00:43:11       They don't like Trump because they believe what he has to say on about taxation because they know he's inconsistent on that. They might like what he says about immigration, but they don't necessarily like the fact that he, you know, was a funder to Hillary and all he got out of it was her showing up to the wedding in many cases, particularly like the way he speaks about women. And I think Carly funeral was fearing it was magnificent in that debate. But what they do like is the fact that he, you know, doesn't give a shit. It doesn't apologize and give such a gigantic, brilliant bloody nose to the establishment that has drifted so far from ordinary people. You and I both, uh, both net beneficiaries of that same frustration. And that's why I like Trump because I think broader look, he said, I don't want him in the White House.

Speaker 2:          00:43:47       I'll be honest. Okay. Don't tell anyone this, but you know, I don't want them in the White House. But I do understand why people like him and the instinct that people have to like him, that sort of sense of mischief and a gadfly Irishness. The reason people want to vote for him because it makes the establishment Republicans so angry and they don't understand it, and I totally get that and I have a lot of sympathy for those people. I agree with those people on a lot of points. I agree with them entirely about the failings and a corruption of the, of the media and political establishment generally. I totally agree with them on all of that stuff, so I wouldn't call myself a Trump fan, but I am a fellow traveler, a fellow traveler. I think that the politicians, it's the failure, isn't it? When it comes

Speaker 1:          00:44:32       to American politics and American education, I think there's some parallels to be drawn and I think one of the parallels is that any of these ancient systems that were established back when the world was completely different and didn't have the Internet, they are no longer valid today. They're just not. And you're, we're clinging to these old ways of operating that if you try to propose them today, no one would buy into it. No one would buy into American universities. If you tried to propose the way you would, if you tried to propose the whole educational system as it is today, what you put people out of college when you release them, they are hundreds of thousands of dollars in debt with no fucking jobs to be seen. And the reason it's wrong isn't that it's anachronistic because there are things that are not strictly justifiable with logic, which nonetheless work best.

Speaker 1:          00:45:23       Like for example, the monarchy. Um, you know, there's no, you can't make a plausible argument as to why we should have a test. If you don't, if you don't, once you get them out, if you don't, somehow or another established a new empire, like what happened, what happened? And I read anything that's anything that's a necessary condition. I just think, you know, for example, the Monica in England, so you can't make a, you can't make a plausible, rational argument to establish a ruling monarchy in United Kingdom today, but it works best. It's the best system, works the best. What's best for expressed for you means we don't get, you know, a European style president with his retinue of, of Jaguars. And you know, and all of the kind of pomp and circumstance and nonsense that goes with that. So that's better. Well the British people understand, United Americans understand this too actually the importance of significance, the binding power and the value of tradition in institution and history and it's something that progressive, progressive is hate.

Speaker 1:          00:46:16       All of the assumptions on which these things are based, they hate all of the effects of them too, which is generally to um, anyway, uh, we, and I think British people instinctively understand the value of having a national icon of figurehead and people come from all over the world because they record, they instinctively understand this too. Um, you know, the monarchy just his works best for us. They think that should be an earned position though. I mean, isn't that what we're all trying to accomplish in life is doing this. This is why I don't believe in grade internships because I think they introduced a dangerous element of egalitarianism into the system. I think people were, Terry is there jumbo shrimp? They will take bread to rule and they should be allowed to get on with it. Born and bred to rule. You're hilarious. Now you're fucking trolling now you're trolling you son of a bitch. How dare you, you know why you're trying to introduce it. A real of a plausible dangerous level of egalitarian to colleges and the, the, the, the system that was in place. And then obviously I do what my point, my point which, which is a serious point is that, um, just because it's anachronistic doesn't make it wrong. There are problems with the, with the university system in America, but I don't think just because you wouldn't construct it like it's constructed today, that means you shouldn't do it at all.

Speaker 3:          00:47:30       No one, Monica is a good example of that. No one's saying that. Well, I don't know if the Monica is a good example of that because I think it's ridiculous. The same Americans, Americans have the same [inaudible] Americans have the same reverence or adjuster for the office of the United States. You know, the office office of the president, United States, reverence for the office. Not everybody in this country likes any, you know, any given president, but you, but you will hear Republicans say, don't say that about Obama. He's the president. He's not my president. I didn't vote for him, but he is the president. So show him some respect for American. No, come on Americans that Americans do have an understanding with him than I think any president because he's just a fucking terrible obviously, but we'll do sad is he? No, he's reduced your standing in the world.

Speaker 3:          00:48:13       So badly home. No idea. Please tell me. As a foreigner on my soil, I will say, look, I love America. I'm one of those, one of those, one of those Brits who repeated by people when I'm not exactly sure if they have a real stance on it. Like why is Obama so terrible in comparison to other presidents kiss in Europe? We've seen the future. Obama wants and we know it doesn't work. We've seen socialized healthcare. We've seen, you know, in gorgeous of the state. We've seen these crazy feminist ideas about the wage gap and, and um, and, and rapes on campus. We have all this in Europe. This is why America is great because it's not Europe. And everything that I'd seen

Speaker 2:          00:48:54       here from Obama suggest to me that he wants to take America, you know, it was used to be the case that Europe follow America's lead in so many wonderful things, but it's pop culture and all. And, and I personally think we'll lose all those have been largely positive, uh, imports. But um, but it now seems like America's following, Europe's leading in censorship, in cracking down on free expression and creativity and all that kind of stuff in, you know, socialized healthcare. These things are disasters. You know, you will hear from Brits because it's the correct thing to say. The NHS is the envy of the world. I mean, I would just encourage you where maybe you don't want to go there, study. You don't take any sick relatives but goes to an NHS hospital. It is horrific, horrendous conditions. Dreadful people die in them all the time.

Speaker 2:          00:49:35       There's a scandal a few years ago, thousands of people dying and you know, some hospital and the Labor government just didn't give a shit or didn't do anything about it. Even though knew this is not, you know, this is not a glittering utopia. Fine. There are some problems with American model and healthcare, but trust me, you do not want the NHS. Um, you know, and the way that Obama is pushing America to be more like Europe I think is some, you know, it's going to hasten its decline as a world power. We have seen your future as my colleague at Breitbart, James Telling Paul wrote a book, I think he called it, I think you called it a bomb Obama mania and that we've seen your future and it doesn't work. And it was a sort of a love letter to the United States explaining that, you know, we've seen where Obama wants to go because we're living it and it's, trust me, it's not what you want.

Speaker 3:          00:50:14       But if the, is that really what Obama wants to do and where he wants to go. And if that was the case, like if you compare what Obama stood for before he got into office and what he's doing now. Can anybody work? What that, what that, well,

Speaker 2:          00:50:28       how about the hope and change website where they talked about the actions against whistleblowers. He is hoping to change website were a big part of his platform was if the routine morning whistle blowers actually made evaporated as soon as he entered the Oval Office, Guantanamo whistleblowers, all the really important style, the morals, the moral statements that, you know, you know what it was, is the kind of things that tell you what sort of man he is. Um, the whistle blower stuff, the Guantanamo, the things that give you a sense of where his moral center is. Those were the things that he jettisoned the minute he entered the Oval Office. And that's why I, why I think, I mean, I'm sorry to hear, but that's, no, no, I think you have a manifesto and you try and see as much of your manifesto through as you can and people hold you to account for any one person really truly has enough position.

Speaker 2:          00:51:12       I think it's a bullshit job. I hope pointed by the United States is structured is to limit the power of the president. Um, you know, that you have all of that, you know, built into the system and it's good. It's all good. But he does have a huge influence on what people talk about, how they talk about it. You know, he makes decisions about foreign foreign policy and war. Um, you know, I was one of the most important things that are, that are a nation can decide about itself is who it's going to fight. Um, you know, he does make those kinds of decisions and those kinds of decisions matter. And he also has the power to move. Say he does, but he does based on what, based on you seeing him talking on television, we have no idea what exactly is going on behind the scene.

Speaker 2:          00:51:47       It was the president has the executive authority to, you know, to launch whatever. You know what I'm talking purely in practical terms, right? This guy can send planes to places, right? Um, but everything we've seen from Obama suggests that, you know, he wants, he wants to take a, you know, a sort of a sort of weird progressive socialized pseudo European approach to domestic policy, healthcare taxation. And this scares us in Europe because we always, we looked up to you guys, you were like, you know, the, you know what it was America for me as a European and you, you know, your viewers are gonna pick holes in this, I'm sure. But for me, Britain is probably the greatest country in the world because it didn't invent democracy or property rights or you know, any of those great values that, that now the world basically revolves around.

Speaker 2:          00:52:30       But it was, it was the best at spreading limit. Um, you know, England in particular spread democracy, property rights, freedom around the world and everywhere that Britain has been is a nice place to live. And anywhere that person hasn't been, you wouldn't want to go to. Um, and America is sort of the distillation of the highest and best values of Britishness, you know, freedom and democracy and free speech and all this kind of stuff. America was America. Like, you know, this petri dish of what, what happened? If we take the very best of British values, the stuff that we've spent centuries, um, propagating around the world, making the world a nice, prosperous, you know, a fair place to live, what will happen if we take them and we cut all the crap out and we make a country like that. And we did, it was America, but that Americans is that you said we did.

Speaker 2:          00:53:15       America was established by people fleeing Britain. Yes, of course. But then they enforce it because we've been in decline for centuries, but, but importing to America, the values that Britain spread around the world have a hundreds of years. But it wasn't the whole deal that we wanted to get the fuck away from everything you guys represented so far. No, no. Not everything is a misnomer. No, no, no, no, no. I mean, America is founded on British values. America was founded on values that the British spread throughout the world. I mean, these values and those values and these institutions as well. I'm talking, I'm talking about, uh, you know, uh, democracy specifically kind of a parliamentary version of democracy rather than a, the particular model of democracy, freedom and free. They were profiting from the TV rights, um, you know, leave their, that's what they were as these, these values, you know, the Britains spread to Indiana spray to, um, you know, the bits of the Middle East that Britain went to the nice places to live now where women, women can dress, how they like Kuwait for example, not terrible place to be where Britain didn't go.

Speaker 2:          00:54:12       Saudi not a place you'd want to be, you know, any, any way that Britain has touched has become better for it. Look at Japan. They were all suits. You know, they talk our language. They were our suits, the influence, and this is it. This is Britain, its influence on the world. No other country, nothing else can touch it. Not Portugal, not Holland. Nobody else can touch Britain for just sheer global influence. Australia, Canada, all places, Britain's, that Britain has touched are dramatically better as a result. But for me, the sort of highest distillation of those, those values that, that Britain was spreading around the world, it was a America and Obama is tearing America away from those values. That's what I don't like. That's why I said it was a terrible precedent. That's why I struggle with, with him in that office because he seems to me to be profoundly, and I know that, I know this is something that sort of crazy right wingers on the internet always say, but he just seems to me to be profoundly on American, on American Pacific respect.

Speaker 2:          00:55:02       He doesn't value, he doesn't share the values on which America was founded. In what sense though? And what way doesn't believe in free speech because they think it's free speech should be curtailed to save the feelings of certain, uh, intro interest groups and minority groups who doesn't believe in, you know, he doesn't believe in, why are you saying that? Where have you heard him say that? Oh. Because the, the effectively the, the stuff he says about Harrison didn't have, you know, he's, he's, he's bought into this Harrison nonsense, this stuff he said about net neutrality, the stuff he said about the rape campus stuff, all of this, all of these things are satellites of the free speech argument, right? Net neutrality being a satellite of the free speech or was this all about free speech? Net neutrality and what's about government regulating the internet? Yes.

Speaker 2:          00:55:42       It's about regulating. It's about the gut known. It's about the government regulating the internet. The, and it needed new channels is about the government regulating the internet, having control over what private companies can do about the relationship that a private company has with its own customer. Right? You have a service firm, I don't know what your providers like a Comcast or whatever. Um, you know, your, your, your relationship with Comcast is a private business arrangement between you and that company. Right? Net neutrality is about the government trying to intrude on that relationship and dictating what kind of business arrangement you can come to with con Comcast and it's going to say Comcast, you can not offer this package of services. You cannot suggest to the customer that they might be uh, a higher tier service for people who pay more. Just like, you know, you can get a better car if you pay more or you can get anything else in life. If you've

Speaker 3:          00:56:24       got more money, you get a better version of it. Right? You can't do any of that. We're going to insist because we've got, we've got this crazy idea of the internet is some kind of utility, um, you know, like a water or something. We're going to come in here and we're going to regulate and control the relationship that you are a private company have with you. A private individual that is, you know, that is, that is at its essence of free speech argument because of what happens when you start regulating that traffic. Now the Internet traffic that is split down, you know, some of it's for Netflix, some of us for emails, some it's whatever. The way in which certain things get, you know, what it wants to do is say the all traffic is neutral. It is. That is all equal. Yeah. Well do not see the benefit of that.

Speaker 3:          00:57:01       Do not see that [inaudible] has no basis in, do you not see that people would be concerned with the government being able to throttle internet away and puts not what it's about. Managed operations have them have the ability to decide how much bandwidth goes to meringues. Americans were worrying about the power of corporations as well. It's not just worrying about it. It's knowing the fact that this has been done illegally already without regulation. You think for a second that if the, if the government has given the power to regulate how an Internet service provider delivers it's packets of data to consumers, they're not going to then start to wonder what's in those packets and then start to say, well actually, you know what? The net neutrality thing was fine. Like it was a really good idea and we loved it and we really haven't bring that to you, but actually we've decided that this kind of data is more important.

Speaker 3:          00:57:45       So we're going to let you do that all in. Or indeed we're going to insist that you prioritize this kind of data and that has consequences for the free market. That's conference consequences for businesses for example. Um, you know, in forcing, well, well that's why an open internet where everyone has access to the same sort of service is what everybody wants. No, uh, I mean that's what we want. I mean there is an argument in America, there's an argument that in insisting that all packets a day show on the Internet are treated equally favors new startups into the market because they don't have to compete with incumbents who have privileged access to high speed an argument. I'm sure it's not just startups, it's people like me that are able to broadcast things. People that want to set up their own servers and put together their own website that does whatever the fuck they wanted to do. That. The idea that that is related in somehow or another.

Speaker 3:          00:58:38       It's not about regulation. It's the absence of I'm fine, I'm, I'm, I'm, I am speaking for the absence of regulation. I'm saying we should not regulate that. We should allow private companies, private companies to do and have whatever influence they want. If you know, look, the market works in these, in these situations, look what happens when Isp is try to manipulate Netflix traffic. Customers complain and they have to stop and they have to put it back again. The market works so well for this, for Internet stuff because everybody internet so vocal, they're online already. They complain about it. It takes two clicks. The market works brilliantly for this stuff. Why allow the government to come in and dictate to private individuals and private corporations what their business relationship should look like and the nature of the services that they provide or money they provide. One another

Speaker 1:          00:59:22       that's that's profoundly on American. Well, there's a, a large argument against net neutrality. There's a large argument online that we could spend hours going over the pros and cons of each side of it. But I think ultimately people have a distrust in large corporations and a distrust in the government and either one of them having control of what has been like the one thing that's empowered people in this country is the ability to put out a message and to get information. And the fact that you can do it now just because, but it could just be cause throttled. It could be, it could be limited. You could, it could be blocked. There's like seriously theory UN thing. Have you been paying attention to you as you went proposal the one who reported on at first it tell people then. Okay.

Speaker 2:          01:00:12       So um, the UN broadband commission, which is not one of the upper echelons of the UN, um, he were the one who reported on the first, how'd you get the information? Well, uh, so somebody else brought the story, but I was the one that reports that are linked. So my story is the one that went around the world. So tweet your story. Yeah, I think so. Powerful, powerful neuron. I know, right? I'm kind of a big deal. Um, that's what I hear. But

Speaker 1:          01:00:33       explain the ridiculousness to this idea that the UN thinks that they're going to,

Speaker 2:          01:00:38       but this is, this is, this is my argument. You see this is the government getting involved in your say excited and the government people don't censoring the UN is saying that and this is wacky crazy stuff, right? This report from the UN broadband commission, the UN broadband commission, this is what we have in Europe. So I don't want you to look from Europe. Police have become Europe. We have in in Europe Commission is specifically set up to find ways it is paid for by European payers and it's purpose is to find ways of regulating the internet. Right? That is what it's for. It is to, you know, it has a, it has a brief to find ways of, of cutting down on Internet freedoms. One of the ways it's found to do that is to get a lot of bat shit crazy feminists in to say that people who ridicule or criticize them on the Internet are in fact guilty of harassment and abuse.

Speaker 2:          01:01:23       And as a result, Internet services should be almost prescreened, you know, words should almost be prescreened before the ever appear on the intentions is the most crazy bullshit. You know, only European come up with this and this report came out and it was full of holes and we examined it. I think I was with the first report when it's detail about this. I read about it once or twice and um, and then I wrote about it a second time and I think the headline was, am I the only responsible tech journalists, journalists left on the planet, which is the only perhaps example self congratulatory of you. Well, I'm actually really modest. I'm actually really humble. I'm like a very humble person naturally. But my sub editors just bully me into this stuff. You understand how they got to get those clicks? I know this is not me at all. If it were up to me, I'd just be at home anyway. So what they want to do is sort of like pre, pre brief all of this stuff a pre pre check it. And if they don't, they want to clamp down. And I ask what you're doing right now is your saying it's okay for the government to get involved in this of regulation

Speaker 3:          01:02:20       of what s of the private relationship RSPs have with the customers. But it's not okay for the government get involved in this kind of regular, keep the pipes open decks open to all bullshit they want on the Internet. No restrictions out of here. Everybody, nobody's giving you any different. They suggesting that that's not going to be hazy. You think you're not until it's already in place. I mean the, the UN thing is essentially a Trojan horse, right? I mean that's really what it is. That's what was so disturbing about it is the idea that the UN could get in and get involved and somehow or another punish a social media websites that uh, and, and make them responsible for what the users' posts. You post some inflammatory, ridiculous shit and they let him see that their name never. But if you did, if you went on a fucking late night, cocaine fueled Twitter rampage and you typed a bunch of ridiculous shit about women with no with no like some women are there.

Speaker 3:          01:03:14       Ours who had all just women. If you do blah, blah, blah, blah, some dreary nit picker like, yeah, I guess I could me, dude, that's my fellow. Here comes another true thing. Everybody's got their thing. I like to leave a mark. You're a Drury. Nitpicking like to leave a mark on people. I have my hair, you'll go nitpicking. You know, I mean, look this, there's actually an interesting discussion around around this and it's that, um, it's about comment sections and commenting what people are allowed to say on the Internet, right? There's this huge trend at the moment and almost every progressive publication as either closed their comments section, we'll indicated that they might, in the early days of the Internet, you had these tech savvy progressive's disproportionately based on coastal cities, coastal cities who said, because the only people they knew who used the internet, we're like of them were hipsters and coastal types.

Speaker 3:          01:04:06       Who said that the Internet was going to create this extraordinary, an amazing new world where everyone could express their opinions. It was going to democratize knowledge and democratize power. Um, and the presumption they made was that everyone, the Internet was going to be nice. Well, most people aren't very nice and most people are particularly aren't nice when I'm in that as a compliment by the way, cause I hate most people. Most people hate nice people. It's boring. I let people who have vicious and bitchy and mischievous, you know? No, I just, every time I do a show this, it just comes back it Gavin McInnes did not even wait. Gavin McInnes did not even wait. I was on his show for three minutes and he's like, you have any idea how gay you are? Well that's Gavin style. I'm a kinder, gentler. You waited an hour, hour and five minutes. Fine. I'll skip. Guess what you just said was so good. I like people that are fishes and bitchy and interesting. Well there's plenty of assholes out there. You're going to have them sent to be nice. So I'm sure you get on tougher. They tend to be very tentatively, pathologically. And Helen Dario, I like. People are a bit more dangerous. I'm always attracted to it. So you like shitty people online.

Speaker 2:          01:05:18       See people, I like people who are more interested. I like people to step outside the Overton window. I like people who pushed the boundaries. I like people who are dissidents. I like people who are disreputable and mischievous and interesting. I'm attracted to interest in people as I am. Right. Not all during it because, but uh, you know, I love people like that fascinated me. I think they're the people who pushed society for the people who come up with a great, interesting theories. Just can't, sometimes they're just cans. But that can be funny too, that, you know, that's the entertainment. I mean, I, for example, I'm not going to add to the sum total of human knowledge. I'm just going to wind a lot of people up for 30 years and hopefully something good about yourself short. You're, and you're making some very interesting, do you know, you are humble.

Speaker 2:          01:05:58       You make interesting points. Let's go back to the point please. The um, the, uh, the comment section stuff right there. This was based on a presumption that everybody on the Internet was going to be, you know, like a Twitter employee, Coco blogger. Yeah. So they come out of this idea, you know, as great Internet, social media, social is gonna be the new thing. We are the guardians going to throw it to newsrooms, open to the public and the assumption that, you know, you know, the Guardian readers and people who live in north London, which is something like Portland or Brooklyn, Brooklyn or whatever sort of, um, sort of north of London and it's like the hipster enclave. No, it's more actually sort of like posh, rich liberals. Um, but it's not quite, it's not directly comparable, but it, you know, instead of like, you know, roughly like that, you know, they were going to be homogenous, nice, polite lefties with the correct opinions about things.

Speaker 2:          01:06:40       Actually what's happened is it took longer. It took longer than I anticipated. But what's happened is that ordinary people now can open Twitter accounts too and not sufficiently technologically educated to do so. And what all of these progressive media, um, uh, companies are discovering the Mike's the boxes, the buzz feeds, the caucus of this world are discovering that most people don't agree with them. They are just, they've never, I know it's shocking, but most people don't believe you should kill all men. Most people don't believe that white people that, you know, black people can't be racist. I, most people don't believe in this extra everything on salon.com nobody believes everything else down. Doesn't believe what's on salon.com. Look, it's impossible to believe those things in good faith because you have to lie to make that you have to lie so much to yourself and to others in order to make those arguments that I don't, I just, it is one long practical joke.

Speaker 2:          01:07:27       That site, it is just a gigantic, it's the Santa, I'm convinced it's funded by the Koch brothers to discredit a liberalism. I'm convinced, absolutely convinced. If you trace, if you trace the sell on money back far enough, you will discover, you will discover the surname coke because it is the only explanation for how badly sal on discredits progressivism is the only exposure. Just today they published another editorial from this fucking pedophile. Um, you know who I wrote about and he wouldn't even dare bring my name up because he's too scared to get into it with me cause he knows he will lose. I probably, you know, he published this thing about how, you know, I'm a pdf farb I don't act on it. Um, right after I had exposed a pedophile, Sarah Nyberg in Gamer Gate, right. And it went all over the world. And it was this huge story that I brought the, hold on, I'm going to stop [inaudible].

Speaker 2:          01:08:10       I exposed this, I have a brand on file. I exposed this pedophile, you know, she was backed up and they doubled all the social justice warriors. Doubledown protected her because she was, you know, on message. Basically, she had the right politics. So they stuck around a kiddy fiddler. This is the state of the modern left, um, directly after that with a coincidental timing. Sal on publishes this thing by a pedophile saying, oh, I'm a bit of hope, I don't act on it. Which is precisely the defense that there's this person who used. Um, so I respond and I, you know, and I, and I, I did a, I did a very good piece of knowing, I urge all of your listeners to seek it out because it really is excellent journalism. Yeah. It was called something like, this is why the left. So this is why liberals, this is why progressive's stick up for pdf files explains why, um, pdf files can get away with this stuff.

Speaker 2:          01:08:54       And why white progressives and liberals back then, um, you think people back pedophiles or they make excuses for them. They make excuses for them as just today. Today they gave us space to this guy who was a pedophile about whom there is horrific stuff online which hasn't come out yet, which you know, you should watch this space for that. Cause I know Steven Crowder knows about some of it and sort of why, um, excuse me. Uh, you should, you should just go, who wrote this? Oscar? Did he give me a second? Yeah, under his own name. This is how brazen they'll row a second piece for salon today playing the victim saying that he came out as a pdf file and he's been subjected to right wing hate so that he says this is the right action. On one hand I'm the creative file and I think so I'm a pedophile and I don't act on it.

Speaker 2:          01:09:39       And I did this like peace and everyone like came out and said that it was really supportive and it was really great and that they help people to get through their own experiences and everyone's really sympathetic except the right wing hate machine meaning me. Well they didn't dare mention me by name. Um, who are the right wing hate machine? Well apparent according to him. Um, you know, uh, uh, exit the right wing hate machine had the temerity to say we think pedophilia is role and why is that on giving a platform for it to this guy when there's so much dirt on the Internet suggesting that he is physically touched young girls for example. Um, you know, and I'm going to, yeah, there is a completely different arguing. Well this is the thing that you sell on. Gave a platform to this guy in San Juan ought to have known about this allegation.

Speaker 2:          01:10:19       If you're going to, if you're going to make space on your platform for a self confessed pedophile and you will, you will only find this on the left is what I mean by the left. Sticking a couple of hours. They make excuses when they try to legitimize them. They tried to give it, they tried to habilitate this as, as an unfortunate sexual orientation rather than, you know, these people being dangerous predators that we need to be protected from sitting there. But you're saying all I've seen is discussing this, but no, honestly all bullshit aside like psychologists and sociologists and neuroscientists or tried to figure out what it is that causes someone to have these desires. But we know from the transgender debate, the left doesn't care about that. When it cares about is who it can, uh, you know, where it can place people in the oppression Olympics and the victim hierarchy and pet. If I'm telling you I'm warning you now is the worry, I'm warning you now is that as the native files, pedophiles are going to be the next, transgender has been one. Now they've won, they've won. That battle is over. Um, do you think so? Yes. Honestly, absolutely stay.

Speaker 3:          01:11:14       It's done and dusted by we, I mean people who actually wanted to find out what the science said to continue to invest in things that are now unfundable um, you know, certain bits of research that don't agree with a progressive consensus, which now can't get funding for that consensus is what kind of research? Well, um, so transgender, the transgender question is complex and difficult and for example, Johns Hopkins doesn't do the surgeries anymore. The guy who used to run it there is a very outspoken critic of transition surgeries is not the best treatment pathway. Um, they all end up killing themselves anyway by most most metrics, no improvement in suicide rates. Um, my view on this is, you know, we're probably going to look back in 30 years and wonder how we could ever have been so cruel as to allow somebody with a psychiatric delusion to start hacking at themselves to make reality conform to their own delusions.

Speaker 3:          01:11:58       But I'm not but by, but by we earlier, what I meant was people who want to be science lead on this and instead what the left very, it was very, it was, there were on the cover of Time magazine Trans, you know the, the Trans thing is the next civil rights frontier. They very clearly articulated, they gave us all the clues we needed to work out how they were going to fight this one. Right? And we just didn't pay any attention at the time or some, some people didn't. Um, they set it up as the next gay or the next bisexual or the next lesbian. It's just the next frontier in the civil rights struggle. I'm telling you, pedophilia is the, is the one after that. But don't you think that if you are a person and you are of sound mind and body and you have a desire to be a woman and you've had this desire your whole life, but you were born a man, shouldn't you be able to do whatever the fuck do you want to do other people?

Speaker 3:          01:12:41       Isn't that really what it is? There are people who wake up one day and think their arm doesn't belong to them. We don't cut their arm off because they think it doesn't belong to them. There are people who believe that they have someone draw on you permanently. I think it looks hot. Thank you very much. I like it too. How far? How far? The sleeves? Just sleeves. But you see my point like, no. Why? Why brain tattoo tattoos with being born as long gender choice. First of personal permanent. There is a view that you should be able to do whatever you want to your body. My argument, we, yeah, fine, but don't make the state pay for it. I don't want to pay for your cock off because you're mentally ill. Um, I will try to dissuade you from doing it and I, I should have a right to say in a national newspaper, which now you don't, please don't do this.

Speaker 3:          01:13:26       Well, I think the argument, you can't get published in national newspaper, this argument, you cannot get published by saying, please don't do pizza. Have transitioned surgery. It's the wrong treatment pathway. You cannot get published because of public opinion, because people were worried about the blow back from the left. Right. And these things, they just dream left. I mean, if I see, if ever you needed evidence that the trainees are mentally ill, it's tranny campaigners. I mean, the transgender lobby are nuts. The reason journalists don't want to write about this stuff or don't want to enter the dangerous territory, is that what they are? And the receiving end of afterwards is just, I mean, I've, I've had it, well, I've had it to my, my confrontation, the, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, of course. And you know, you're right about that. It's so unfair. You know, these women who are getting the crappy now of them by somebody who's not only unfair if you don't say that you used to be a man, but you should have the ability to say yes for new option to opt out and they shouldn't.

Speaker 3:          01:14:16       I mean, what are we going to do? So any man who wants to, any man who wants to be a women's MMA fighter, we're just going to basically give him a gold line pathway to the championship because nobody's going to a woman's gonna wanna get in a ring with him and have her jaw broken. That's not okay. I think, you know, it's perfectly reasonable to say if you weren't born a woman, you don't get to fight in a women's competition. I think that's perfectly reasonable, perfectly reasonable. And uh, objective. There's the in scientifically valid too, but there's a science behind you and I both on the wrong side of, of popular opinion on this one. We're not, well, I know we often, no, not what ordinary people think, but the media, the media and political establishment of made up their minds on this and it's, it's gone.

Speaker 3:          01:14:56       It's gone. How did the writing this real interesting that right gets this wrong so it gets this wrong everyday. The reason I win, I think there's no repercussions in supporting it. That's why there's no repercussions in supporting, well, they're all trans gender to be, we ought to, I mean, look, you know what? I'm saying to me, [inaudible], it's a woman. Get over it. She should be able to fight men. There's no repercussions. But if you say you're out of your fucking mind and because you're always going to self determination and all the rest of it. Yes, no that's true. But that is entirely a construction of the left, entirely construction to the left, the aggressive, progressive, aggressive, progressive and you know, and these people who you just missed earlier is fringe nutcases. They have entirely dictated what you were allowed to say on that subject. And if you don't say the right thing for now, what I think, I think it goes like this and then it comes back.

Speaker 3:          01:15:46       No, right now it's come and give me an example of us. Give an example of what's come back back right now to progressive fuel. Progressive's have one, a um, a society aren't women shit often listen, does progressives, they won gay marriage. They will. They will, absolutely do you don't, you don't think, you don't think gay marriage is good cause you don't want to get married. Do you want to have an excuse? Well just around town. Yeah. Okay. That's what it is. I don't want engaged. I don't want gays to become, so Bosch, we sell to be judging judged by other people's standards, but being born gay's not fun. And if you have to be gay, if you have to, you know, Jesse Anal sitting there, we'll look. I'm having a wonderful time. You know I love me. I am a note stretch of the imagination, self loathing.

Speaker 3:          01:16:35       I'm very happy with who I am. So how very English my sex life. Well, because it hasn't been an easy road. This now rather be gay or be that Fat lady from Kentucky that won't marry gay people. Kim Davis. Yes. Who would you rather they be? Okay. Just got fucked over. Way Worse than you'll Kim Davis. The Shit is God damn genetic. Roll the dice possible. Not a difficult, difficult thing to southern fucking blotchy skin. If I were heterosexually wouldn't be Kim Davis, so be Kim Kardashian. I doubt it. Not if you were born in her life and lived her life fucking body

Speaker 1:          01:17:10       and that I have the actionetics fucking snake. I've probably had sex with more black men. This their entire family. Nay guys, I don't know. I don't think she's hot. Listen, I'm going to call Dash Dashlane. I wish I was stupid. I could have been such a great like Bimbo. I would've, I would've been so good. You think so? I would have been so good at it. I don't think so. Intelligence has been coast. I don't think you're ruthless enough. Maybe kind have a nice guy. He's a secret thing. I didn't like you think too much. And it's also, you're like contemplating things and even though you make rash generalizations, obviously well studied each individual issue in general. Attorney get picker, Riri nitpicking. This is it. Now I'm changing it on my phone. Thank you. I like, you know, I think we see a lot of these things.

Speaker 1:          01:17:57       I think we have a lot of ideas in common a lot. Um, I think that I'm trying to stick up for men even though you agree with me, just to go from that stopping pussies, that stuff. The reality is it's not that easy. Exactly. That's why some people rise to the top and most don't because it's not easy. Cool. Get out of the bed and get your fucking shit. I am the biggest meritocratic you will ever meet. You can keep just holding on and let anybody tell you you can't. God dammit. That's what we don't. You don't need to have your handheld and laws changed and we need to make it safe for, for men, for men space. We met in this country being ignored by women and we have to put a stop to that. We not gonna. They're not attractive. Why are they not attractive?

Speaker 1:          01:18:44       Because women are smart. They know these guys are pussies. They don't want this pussy shooting up fucking disease load inside of them and making some dump fucking kid that they have to raise. They don't want it so they reject these fools. These fools are there because you can get me on a little styrofoam plate and a fucking supermarket. It's too easy to buy milk. It's too easy to get your vegetables. You don't have to do a goddamn thing. It's easy. That's why. That's why these guys are pussies because the world is soft. They're like lottery winners. You ever met a lottery winner? They never keep their money because it's too fucking easy. They don't appreciate it. And these guys that have gotten through this shitty, dull gray life cause they don't like you. You don't even like you become someone, somebody with like you. Fuck. That's the solution. It's not changed the laws or get on the top of a mountain with a torch. We have to stop these women from ruining these men look at them and they're running away. They're running away to be by themselves because the women won't have them anymore. Cool. Well they don't even like themselves.

Speaker 1:          01:19:51       You gotta understand dude, I'm with you on a lot of this. Okay? Don't stick up for pussies. It's not good for them. It's not good for anybody. I want them to have self confidence. I want to work out the way we do it. Hold their hand. Fucking let them cry and your sh you're expensive suit. I think

Speaker 3:          01:20:08       I wouldn't let them near it is that great line in the lost world. A second Jurassic Park movie. It's like careful the suit cost more than your education. I'm not a big fan of the military. I'm not a big fan of like people I care about love joining the army, going over and killing people overseas unless it's absolutely necessary of course. But uh, I'm a big fan of, I think a lot of people would benefit from fucking boot camp. I think I agree with you and I might not be such a fucking pansy if we'd had it comfortable, goddammit. No, I mean like, you know, if if I'd been through bootcamp, I might not chosen to be gay. Um, watts, that's probably been the number one spot. I think more people are and bootcamp than anywhere you go. Now he gets to roll. My whole fucking 30 guys are all together.

Speaker 3:          01:20:54       You don't think a few months off and I let at school. So that's what I'm saying. I was working my way through the cricket team, especially when they're on a boat. We didn't have a lot of navy, almost would have been there. Um, yeah. Yeah. The navy week isn't it? Was it like black guys? That was the joke was the cricket. You get some Indian dudes, right? They're pretty good at cricket. Indian dude's sorry. Huh? Too much curry. No, smells the look, you're not allowed to say that. He knows all that to say that, but that, you know, it's not, it's not a race thing. It's not a race thing, but there's a certain diet like in a Oh duck goalie, Bangladeshis ever certain Diane it gives us, it's a very older three particular, um, and I can say this is somebody who's banged a lot of Asian guys.

Speaker 3:          01:21:33       Um, you know, there's a very particular odor to like Bengalis Topanga, Deschutes, the kind of food data's pretty heavily spiced fish that can stuff that's actually those people as Asia. That's interesting because yeah, we call the major weak automations and stuff. But you know, it's the same with, I don't know whether it's a race there. Mike Cleaner is a Ghanian Mike made is like a Ghanaian. I'm Muslim and I'm such a good person. Ghanaian Ghanian from gone. Gone it. Yeah. I'm really good person, so I let her keep her on in my house and stuff, even though it's a bit like kind of just a bit terrifying just so she reads a crime and you're your man and she's praying and I'm like, I hope I'm not telling him making bacon. You're paying for this. Um, no, but why quite often do during Ramadan is like is I reheat last night's KFC, um, just to talk to her.

Speaker 3:          01:22:15       Um, but no, I, you know, Shit. But she, you know, she has a very pungent aroma and I'm sure it's, I don't, I don't know. Is that a race thing or you were even allowed to say that he liked, well, you're not supposed to be really on you. It's like saying men are different from women. You're not really supposed to say any more. But no, there is, there is a certain, I mean I quite like it and I like those guys. I'm always asking if she's got hot suns and she would never tell me. I'm wondering why I quite like it, but the area. But there is definitely that. I mean like if she's, if she's been in and she's been mopping and whatever, you can smile and like two hours later and I come home, I know she's been there. Wow. That's bizarre. You're like a wolf.

Speaker 3:          01:22:49       Did you have really good, I do have a really good sense of smell actually. That's weird for a gay guy. Why? Because I would think dude smell like shit. No like stinky. I would think that would be like, like they put flowers, hours, perfume and women quite like how men smells. He imagined men into men. They quite like it. Oh okay. That does. Yeah. So some guys like be, oh yeah, some guys smell bad. I perspire quite a lot, but I don't smell like I, I if, if I get, I get sort of grotesque, but let's change the subject. There's, I know women that like the way dude stink when they get back from the gym. No, I quite like fucking stay quite like they like it dirty bitches dirty. I would be such a such a whore. Right? Well, you know, there was a bus, there was a study such a slot.

Speaker 3:          01:23:33       I'd be pregnant at 12 I would have had so many abortions by now. Wow. There was a university of Rome, I believe, did a study on homosexuality and they had a theory that the reason why, um, people became gay was a variation on the x chromosome. And so because there was a disproportionate amount of homosexual men that were birthed from women that were promiscuous, so just exceeding how terrible women are. I think some men just see it, see it really early and think that is so much crazy just to like, just to come in something. I have to deal with that. No, thank you. I'm gonna go with boys. That's so ridiculous. I'm coming to you as a straight man and you're talking nonsense for the most part. Great. I went gay to get it. My mother. That's how it's revenge. I'm kind of a revenge homosexual.

Speaker 3:          01:24:19       Like a wall. Like a werewolf. Is that a convertible? Yeah. Well, you'd be like the full moon. Your mother turned you right? Yeah. Yeah. It's tired. Yeah. No. So I went and because it wasn't sufficiently scandalous that I lost my virginity in a interracial five, some of the drag Queen, um, that's not enough. I know. So I started probably, I started bringing him, they're like 13, maybe 13, drag queens, interracial drive, some five. So yeah, it was grass. The first one. Yeah. Well I was just fucked for life until you get gone. Uh, no. So I switched my home black boys instead. And that she was upset about, um, she just, was it a racial thing that she was just coming down and they was just these black guys with like, you know, with like cocaine and pills out on the breakfast table at 7:00 AM 14.

Speaker 3:          01:25:05       Yeah. I think people would have a problem with that whole, the black guys a couple of years older, not a hugely alto. And they went to, they went to the bad schools. I mean, what's the go down cool. Baddies can, we didn't have black people in my school blow and fucking their son. Um, so yeah, no, and then, and then it just, and then it just sort of, I just got stuck in a row and now it's kind of a bad habit. But you know, I wrote a column about this like I'm so bored of being gay and everybody took it as a joke. It's actually one of my serious things will ever, ever written. Um, I'm only really attracted to things that are transgressive that are naughty. And I talked, you spoke about this earlier, like I like dangerous, difficult people. I only really sexually excited by things that are forbidden and now gay people are endlessly Molly cuddles and flattered and sucked up to in society is kind of the sexist lost its luster for me.

Speaker 3:          01:25:49       I'm thinking, I think I thinking that I might go heterosexual, I might, I might do something that's going to take you think I might do some things. I might do something that you know is going to invite ridicule and criticism and he's going to make given me a more difficult life. I might become a straight white male with all due respect. I think you'll find it very difficult to find suitors that are worthy of your appearance with us. If you're a woman, you can dance back and forth through those worlds with little to no worries. Women who's in full words all the time, suck a few Cox, take some deck and get fucked by five guys. One of them's a drag queen. He tells stories, code black guys, fuck you Nigga. Fuck fuck. They're going to think about that. Worry them. Yeah, they're just going to go.

Speaker 3:          01:26:40       This guy is just to guy. I just can't just, you can't trust him. He love me. Like I'm surrounded by women all the time in a friendly way. They were a friend, but because that's what you are, but they'd let me do you understand the difference? Let me fuck some of them. But which those are the ones that would let you fuck them. No, you know what I'm saying? I ain't trying to be nice to your friends. Wait ones. It'll let you fuck him. You don't want to fuck. No, you're probably right. Trust. Make sure the hot ones being that friend, they're going to fuck a guy who, uh, never, never had a doubt. So it's true. So I'm going to get really bad, a bad quality of woman. If I go straight, stick with the black dudes. When we got, she got an animals or something, become a nicker file.

Speaker 3:          01:27:19       Now I transgender really flipped a switch. It could be a trainee, I think such a pretty girl. Yeah, but you got to keep it just in case, you know, she and I would throw my toys out, the prop Z or z or my pronouns are like, here, here, here, here. My pronouns are. Fuck you motherfucker. It's amazing. The new pronouns, Harvard University is trying to get people to use these new pronouns. I mean, you're winning on this so sided. Never transition just to antagonize people because they'd be like, yeah, I still got to take, we still gotta call me. She, um, that's the move, right? Say I'm a woman or wait until I'm in trouble. I'm gonna pull, I'm gonna pull a Bradley Manning. I'm going to wait until I get in trouble. And then to elicit sympathy from idiots. I'm going to go trends. Are you trying to say that that's a Bradley Manny did.

Speaker 3:          01:28:08       How dare you, you would never make that application. Chelsea Manning, by the way, gender week. I missed [inaudible]. I still called Bruce Bruce. What? Of course you do. 60 years as he had it. I Dunno. I'm not even going to be nicer. You fuck to dude. Well, yeah, you're right. It should. It shouldn't be a women's company. Doosan, it's amazing stuff. Amazing media. Now Caitlyn Jenner won the men's hundred repeaters like stuff. Now this, is that what they're saying now when she wanted the correct way to describe, uh, his, his or her accomplishments as an athlete, the technically correct way to do it is to use the new name and the past accomplishments. She won the men's whatever. I don't even know what's kind of supposed to be one of the guys he competed in the Olympics with believes that this whole transition to him becoming a woman had to do with taking steroids for the Olympics after he got off the steroids.

Speaker 3:          01:29:03       Oh, for sure. That's a big mean. If you live in that family, if you live in the Kardashian family, you know, it is a war of attention seeking. And this is attention seeking something. I understand, you know, and they're constantly trying to one up one up each other and everyone thinks Kim's got the lead and everyone, you know, and everyone thinks, I'll go Kim. And then Bruce comes out and says, well, the nuclear bomb, I got one for you, drops the fucking atomic, but the neutron bomb, whatever, you're a weapon of mass destruction, analogy of choices, uh, drops this bomb. It's like, Oh yeah, I can, I want to get vanity fair. Yeah, watch this shit. I shit. Nobody cared about him at all for the decade. It was on the show. Who was the whipping boy show? And he got so sick of it. It was like, I really, really need some tension.

Speaker 3:          01:29:48       I live in the cabinets, is a Kardashian family. I've got to do something. But I also think that he probably came as a slot. Chloe's fat. Kim's a slut. She's married with children. Sir. I wasn't a judgment. Trust me. I mean, I identified with her, I told you about, you know, Kim's a slot, Chloe's flat. Okay. Calories, fat. And Bruce is a woman, you know, it's like they all have something, right? Well, he certainly does now. I mean, he may not have it anymore when with his face at the very least, he turns his face into a woman's face. And you know, I love it. I was trying to send it to me. I want to make a serious point about this section. What I love about the transgender debate is how damaging it is to feminism. Um, trying to, hold on. It's about, actually, it was my original point, right? This is where you were going to go, isn't it? There's something that feminine,

Speaker 2:          01:30:30       we say about transgender, particularly the male to female transgender is why do they always choose such classically feminine

Speaker 3:          01:30:37       looks? Why don't they become what we want, which is a sort of genderless fat blue head on pip hell brigade. Like if you're going to go trends, what they want is for you to cut, become kinda queer. They want you to become, you know, blue allergic, Chris asexual disaster of a human being rather toenail high heels, people who've, men who become women become women like very stereotypically women. And this is interesting because this is um, this is a sort of physical manifestation of a psychological

Speaker 2:          01:31:06       cool problem for feminism. And it is this, if you accept that people can be born with the wrong brain, that a man can be born with a woman's brain or a woman can be worn with a man's brain. That goes a long way to destroying 40 years of gender politics and gender theory, which says that all sexuality and all gender is socially constructed. Then that's why men behave like men do. And women behave like women do. If you accept and you put on the cover of Time magazine in or Vanity Fair, a person who has had the wrong brain in the wrong body and when they transition they take on new characteristics, new forms of behavior on all the rest of it. You are admitting that some of these qualities are innate or biological, that there is such a thing as a male brain. And a female brain.

Speaker 2:          01:31:47       This is something that feminists have been denying for decades, and it is incredibly damaging to the, to the feminist project, to the idea that everything is cool because when I want to break down the gaps between men and women, they want to make girls play with action, man and boys or just boys up as princesses. What they're suggesting is the all gender is taught that it's a social construct that we teach boys how to be boys. So we should teach boys to, you know, be nice instead of violent. You know, and this is toxic masculinity thing. Well, what transgenderism demonstrates quite clearly if we accept it as face value as progressive's us too, is that there is indeed such a thing as a male brain. And there is indeed such a thing as a female brain, um, that being the case, ordinary people have them too.

Speaker 2:          01:32:25       Uh, and that explains why, for example, there aren't as many women in stem subjects. It explains why men have certain behavioral characteristics, you know, and all of this stuff that feminists have been telling us is just society and Patriarchy and conditioning. Hmm. Hang on a minute. You can't hold these two beliefs simultaneously. You cannot believe both of these things in tandem. You have to pick one. And this is, you know, the reason that some people on the quiet acquaintances Yaz to get a on the political right and quite enthusiastic about the transgender thing is they know it unravels the feminist project and it unravels two generations of crazy progressive feminism in one fell swoop because it demonstrates, um, by their own admission what total bollocks. The idea of constructed gender as well. It certainly is fascinating when you watch people being celebrated for traditional feminine appearances.

Speaker 2:          01:33:10       Absolutely traditional accepted feminine appearances dresses, but they would kill to be fat blue. How, you know, that's what they're showing me. That's the most durable. They won't have to be ugly like they are Trans America. The cover, the vanity fair, was it Vanity Fair or New Yorker? Whichever one they want her to be ugly. Like they are ugly and they are ugly, which is why they became feminist in the first place. There are gauges why they're left wing it. My favorite feminist are the ones that will never accept transcend transgenders. Oh, the tests. Yes. I love them too. It's a tough, this, this woman I told you about, the concentration camp woman, she's a tough, I think all she, she's accused of being a tough, these people who say that I'm transgender women or not women, uh, because they haven't had a woman's lived experience. In fact, all they're doing is acquiring the victim hood mantle by which they sort of admit the whole Jake, you know, in the courts of this, in order to be a turf, you have to sort of admit that there's such thing as a female privilege and what they're basically saying it as a transgender person, you can never acquire the full degree of female privilege.

Speaker 2:          01:34:05       Yeah. Because you can't claim your oppressed victimhood status and get special dispensation or you can't do any of those things because you're not a real woman. You never had a woman's experience. We don't want you, I love them. I love them because they're just the most brilliant example of let's just dysfunctional, fucked up, left on left violence. It's wonderful. Or this sort of house of cards of ludicrous theory that's totally internally inconsistent. This is one of these, the one of those times in which it just implodes, that stuff's accelerated and they're eating themselves at a staggering rate. When I wrote about this, I wrote about this in a, in another great piece that you're, oh, what's it called? It's called minority wars. And my point in this was that, um, in the last, if the last 10 years have been bit about setting men against women and find, you think men are just man the fuck up and I know you're entitled to that view. Um, I have, I taken a slightly more compassionate view of this stuff. Um, if you, if you believe that the last 10 years, I think most people do the progressive project has been sister set women against men. The next 10 years is going to be even worse. The next 10 years is going to set

Speaker 3:          01:34:58       sexuality against sexuality, race against race, gender against gender. Um, so you're gonna get Hispanics versus blacks in America is Hispanic. Hispanics for example. Um, uh, that's interesting because Hispanics don't have the guilt about slavery that white people do. So when Hispanics or running cities like Baltimore, the policing is going to be brutal. It is getting, you're never going to, you will never see. You will never have seen anything like it. Um, what, what Hispanics, Hispanics are going to be the going to be the demographic majority in this country. They, well, they don't have the same guilt. They don't have the white guilt that allows black lives matter to flourish. Right? They only reason black lives matter is a thing is because of white guilt. You really think that you don't think it's because of black people are getting fed up, that they see people getting shot for no reason.

Speaker 3:          01:35:41       They see. It's definitely a pleasing, definitely placing form. But you can swap being teasers on their body. You can in the black people as indeed I do with my body and in many cases, uh, and nonetheless not think the black lives matter is the best thing for black people with black lives matter. Perpetuates a culture of victim hood, which is, I want to do this. Not really black. What's his name is Shaun King. Yeah, he's still, you know, Shaun King story is amazing. It's amazing. This guy, and you know what, he came back with this male Rachel came back with this blog posts. You know, it's another wonderful story of Brooke. Um, he came out with this because you break that story too. Of course I brought that story. How dare you. Um, I know I put that, um, well actually you told me about that on Twitter.

Speaker 3:          01:36:21       That's how I found out. Um, so anyway, uh, he, he comes back after all this reporting and says, oh, well the man, they're, they're right about everything except the amount on my birth certificate is not my real dad. My mum had an f like throws his mom under the bus because my mom was a slot 30 years ago. Effectively. Um, and I'm not getting any more interaction. Never asked about who my dad is. I don't know anything about him. I've never lost in 30 years who my dad is. Okay. All right, fine. Carry on. The only thing I know about him for absolute short, I didn't know his name. I don't know who he is. I don't know where he is. The only thing I definitely know about him as if he was black, isn't it possible DNA. Social. Well, he really, he didn't like, didn't acknowledge it was a black, a black political, well this is what I was thinking.

Speaker 3:          01:37:01       I was like kissing someone and get a cup. You know, like they do in the movies where you should put him on 23 and me. But there was a black political action committee. They said they'd give $25,000 a black lives matter. If he submits to do a DNA test, did he wouldn't do it at black political action committee said put this to rest. We'll give $25,000 a black lives matter and he wouldn't do it. So we're in the situation now. I know these things. Tell me all I need to know now we're in a situation with Shaun King has pronounced Shaun King innocent, but you don't have to ask any more questions and you just got to take his word for it. Well, sorry, I don't, there's still going. The guy's white is still a big part of black lives matter. Well, he's one of the figureheads.

Speaker 3:          01:37:35       I mean I think he's a thing like couldn't you be white? And also think that black lives matter, like the end piece is identity politics. They didn't want you, they don't want you, you, you have no village to speak on those issues. It's like, and I was just no, right. Speak about feminism. Um, you know, this is, this is why it's so damaging to black lives matter. The fact that, you know, all of their figurehead seemed to end up either being lunatics or being white. What is, what was wrong with this movement that, that no, authentically black people seem to be able to lead it. I'm like, there must be this. Yes, there's something wrong. What's wrong with them, deray? Dude, this is promising homosexual. How dare you. I might be gay, but that's still it feel like he is. He's just so odious and unbearable.

Speaker 3:          01:38:17       And I loved also, I loved, oh, he's probably the most unlikable person in America that meets. What's this? I don't think he is give these interviews. I think he's intelligent and well spoken. So nice about everyone except the men that need you man up pussies, pussies. But deray MCKESSON's great goal. It's like what's wrong with you? It seems like a great guy. I mean, when I've heard him interviewed me in a way they're put together with the bomb, which were the only black person I w not sexually attracted to. Wow. He, you say this. What? Well, I mean, not like, I mean like I would, but no, uh, I, I find him so what's wrong? What are you sort of like sort of preening comedy, Homo, um, you know, sort of prancing around in his ones is that often it's just dreadful, but he's a product of this terrible political assumption.

Speaker 3:          01:39:11       You got to be black and gay in a rights protester and another, the black lives matter leaders is white. And the NAA NAACP chapter heading and bought in the Washington in Spokane, in Washington is white. And I'm thinking to myself, she resigned on what's wrong with this movement? No, she's still in place. Or She just resigned from something's been all, uh, I'm thinking to myself, what's wrong with this movement that no black people see me? We're able to lead it. And the reason is that this is, as, this is fueled a source thing, you know, it's fueled by, um, white guilt and progressive liberal establishment, which is incredibly, one could not exist without, but he's not a real black is fuck, I don't know. I just said it to annoy people. I'm getting like, Twitter is going to be ridiculous now. I don't even know what I mean by that.

Speaker 3:          01:39:57       I guess I just don't like the idea that black people can be homosexual. I liked, I liked, I liked the idea that everybody's black guys, the idea that I'm sort of talking them out of their heterosexuality for one night, you know, I just, I think it's all about why I think it's all about my sort of my doc rape fetish. Um, oh, I just don't know. I like, I like just, I don't like the idea of black people as homosexuals. It just feels wrong to me. You got some fucking issues. No, I just have preferences. I just, you know, I like to imagine they're heterosexual. Gonna have sex versus if you were involved in potential relationships to these prophecies of heterosexual black west to pursue and which ones not to. This is a man you don't even know. Oh, he's an activist and you're like, I just prefer him to not be gay.

Speaker 3:          01:40:43       I have a real problem with him being gay. I have preferences problem with him being gay. I just did it. He's like gay people. No, of course I don't. Of course I don't. I love, I love Dick, but I hate Larry. You like hanging out with my people, all of their fucking Tutus and Madonna like, okay, look, I have my notes. I have my moments with my moments with Mariah Carey. But um, but no, the way they behave, the music they listened to, how they dress, how they speak, and worst of all, which really fucking annoys me. It drives me absolutely crazy the way in which gay people have now become such bullies. They're using all the tools, um, against other people or Christians, the bakeries, all that kind of shit that used to be used against them. Gay people have become the worst kind of sanctimonious bullies and it makes me ashamed to be a homosexual when I see the way that they bully other.

Speaker 3:          01:41:31       My other minorities, the way they bully religious minorities. And I think 50 years ago, this was gaze. When I see the way that gay people brave, when I see that couple, that gay couple who went to memories pizza memory speaks of your, remember was the, was the Christian breaker you said? You know, probably wouldn't. We'd rather not Katie wedding if that's okay because some, some idiot, you know, a troublemaker on the left had gone, gone basically gone outrage shopping called up everybody in Indiana. And so will your Keto when you came to willow cater, finally found somebody who said, I prefer not to anyway. Is that these days in question admitted that he, well, I think one of the question around are of going to one day nobody went there and got turned down and humiliated by Evil Christians. A liberal reporter went around shopping for someone who said no they wouldn't.

Speaker 3:          01:42:16       And it took them days to anyway, just like sweet enrolling stays. She went rate shopping. Sabrina Erdely admitted that she went around looking for the most sensational rape story possible. And of course it turned out to be bullshit. But the [inaudible] hold on. I'm don't mean to interrupt you, but I did not know that that was not an actual story. The top, by the way, it's cooked up by the media. I thought it was a real gay couples. This is how I fell into it. And you know, and you know what? The real gay couple, do you know what Real Cook Gay couples are doing today? Well, this is just, it just makes me so, no, no, they're not becoming Bosch while they're getting a car and a kid and a pet. And then know that not having, because tiny embers, no, they're not all full. I hate those kind of gaze, the most of all that terrible.

Speaker 3:          01:42:55       My delegate, you should be toppling out of a nightclub off your tips, off your tits on ketamine at 4:00 PM on a Monday afternoon. Call yourself a homosexual. You drive a golf like you know, just stop her range rover but carry on. Get the kid to school by eight Oh no, I've got to get back cause I've got bridge club at 10 just die. Well he teaches spin class, crossfit cross soul cycle. What kind of a self respecting gay person does soul cycle or bad for you? Oh Oh all cardio. Cardio's gay sex and drugs. Like any other gay person, crystal Meth and 12 hour fuck sessions and they stayed in in the 80s aids news. Fantastic. You know, I'd love if I kind of do want it because is yeah, because it's not a death sentence anymore. You can't dye your all the great drugs. But if

Speaker 2:          01:43:52       you delay taking the drugs, you get thin, you lose all your body fat, you get so much attention or buyer dollars or the presence when I'm tired all the time. Now, what's the different way more staff? You're talking so fast. I don't buy the fact that you're tired all the time. It's hard to get a word in edge wise. You're on fire. I don't buy the title anyway exhausted. Just going to finish them sores all over your face. You don't want that. Actually that's not hot, but it's just the early stages. But you know like the first, the first, the first six months in the bowl or the first six months of age, fantastic. Lose all your body fade your shit all the way out balls. You get sores all over your body. First, first stage, first gay couple this week. And then I promise I'm going to give this subject up, but um, gay couple this week decided to renew them at renew their wedding vows.

Speaker 2:          01:44:35       Right? And they go to memories pizza and they pick up pizza and they stop parading around on stage. How they got memories pizza or they were doing those nasty Christians who don't wanna cater gates. And I thought to myself, and then the NATO sent these pictures of the press or whatever, and I thought said, what a nasty, vindictive, bitter, soulless way to treat your own wedding or your vowel renewal or whatever. Turn it into this triumphalist bitter public political stumped. And I thought it was so cheap and so classless and it represented everything that's wrong with the gay establishment today. And it was just, I just saw that and I thought, God, I hope people don't think that about me when they know I'm gay, you know, um, this, these preening bitter, spiteful, nasty queers. And I thought to myself, in my head, you fucking idiots.

Speaker 2:          01:45:18       Like you are doing so much damage to the public view of homosexuality. You know, making people think that [inaudible] spiteful, bitter behavior is how we all behave when we get a taste of power. Because of course how we judge people. We judge, one of the ways we judge people's, how they behave when they're in power and now gays or the establishment, you know, acquiring gazer power, look at the disproportionate important, you know, a disproportionate numbers of homosexuals in, you know, in employment, in the media or whatever. They're constantly fated and mollycoddled and uh, and celebrated and all of that is good. Like the quality is great and you know, all that's all that's important, but it's really telling how they behave when they get to that position. See this aberration, this one couple that you're talking about, Kim Davis, the same thing. The same thing happened to that other that they know that, what is it like three or four bakeries and pizzerias in the u s now the same thing's happening in Ireland, in England, in, um, you know, all over the place.

Speaker 2:          01:46:07       Gays are becoming bullies and I don't like seeing it. I think what's happening is it's you get a bunch of people who are unhappy that know that they can have an impact by doing a something and they know they have a green while they're obviously on, I wouldn't behave like this, but what? They don't do a something. Then they're giving you something as we can protest in this fashion and we will get a pop. But they've been given carte blanche to go after religious minorities because the, the media establishment, politicians, all the rest of it continually give the signals. Are you on Kim Davis Society? Is that what you're saying? I mean, I don't look, she can't, she can't do the job right. She can't do the job. So she probably shouldn't be in her posts cause she can't perform the functions of her job, her beliefs.

Speaker 2:          01:46:47       If she refuses to issue those licenses and that is the law, right? She can't be in her job. But you know what's interesting? She's these days, the example of a conscientious objector. She's an example of somebody sticking up for their beliefs or their political opinions or their life or their life choices or their faith or whatever in the face of the law, in the face of public opinion. And the face of, um, you know, received wisdom, the consensual, the rest of it. She is doing what gate can rights campaigners were doing 50 years ago. And I think it's very telling now. Gay people are mollycoddled and protected. And you know, I've been a beneficiary of that. I've seen it in action. Um, the way that now they can turn around and bully religious minorities solely to feel better about themselves in this horrible bitter way that they do. Um, and lesbians the worst by the way. Um, the way they can now do that to people who have faith to religious people. Um, makes me slightly feel slightly ill and I'm really, I really object to it. Let's slow down.

Speaker 1:          01:47:43       You're saying that she is doing what what gay activists were doing 50 years ago, which is make brief stands. They get them in prison to get that go against the law. Go against gay activists were never in a position to alter other people's lives or deny them of a public service that's on the books. See the problem, which is that she used her own, she should've never been put in prison, but you can't compare her to any form of an act as you can. How could you possibly do that? Because she's affecting other people's lives that have nothing to do with me, that she shouldn't be in her because she can't do her job. While the entire time being guilty of several sins, one of them, the fact that she's being a demo course, the primary sin of a swinging, switched out surprised after she still won't happen.

Speaker 1:          01:48:30       This is how the Democrats treat their own well, and the GOP came and supported and of course the pneumococcal be flew in a private jet. Of course, the New York Times accidentally published that she was a Republican. Of course. What a terrible Ms Democrat you mean? No, no. They published that. She was a republican. Well and there was a normal, she was a democrat. It was guilt times. Just assumed without checking what you're saying. Oh, I said they printed in the newspaper that she was a republican because I was the New York Times did and then, oh sorry. Made a mistake about that. And of course no one ever sees the corrections. So now every lesson that would fox news always does. When someone does something creepy, they put d next to their name and find out fair and balanced and they find out all those really are Republican. I know, I love Fox News. I'm going to say a bad word about Fox was great. I think that the gut is good friend nearly that the comparison is pretty ridiculous to say that she is doing what gay activists were doing in the 1950s.

Speaker 2:          01:49:22       Let's, but, um, from my point of view as somebody who is both religious and homosexual, um, your religious, yeah, well, I mean I saw my, my match with nearly speaking, I'm Jewish, but I was raised Catholic. Um, and um,

Speaker 1:          01:49:34       so does that mean to you practicing in the middle of ketamine on perfect fuck sessions? Yes. Well that's not very religious. Shoulder men in dresses. What's not to love? If it hadn't been for Michael, I wouldn't have

Speaker 3:          01:49:48       made nearly as much money in my twenties. He told me to get such good head, you know, um, I gave such good blow jobs off to after three years in choir. Um, no, I mean, um, so you're not religious? No, no. I'm I believe I don't necessarily go to mass all the time, but I'm a Catholic. We can call it would leave one myself a catholic. Yeah, I'm going to know a good Catholic, but you know, but when you say you believe, like you believe in what the Bible, I believe in Catholicism. I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm a Catholic. I think so you believe that it's a good idea to have confession and you have a, a dude who never had sex ever listen to fuck stories whispered through. Yeah. Hole in the wall absorbs you cut baby dicks, you know, for, for for a is very nitpicky turn of dress like a wizard sitting on the golden throne.

Speaker 3:          01:50:33       Right? We're done. You have to cut down father. That all make sense to you. You know, want to Catholics. Well, do you know what this world could do with a bit more pomp and circumstance? A little bit more a drama. And it could be the man who supports the fucking matriarchy. She knew what this work could do. It could do with it. A little bit more of that. I mean, just look at that. Look at the dreary hell of the atheist arts scene. Look at, you know, look at this. There's some total arts. My contribution to human searching, the atheist arts I meet. What I mean is, you know, you still get, the atheists are seen. Look at almost all the good movies ever made. Look at almost all the great albums ever made. Look at almost all the great convenient told jokes, pay Hollywood, atheist, some biznow.

Speaker 3:          01:51:14       No, none. Comics. I like if you believe line comedians contributes to the sum total of human civilization and knowledge in the way that anyway, that Michelangelo did. I mean Dars, Oh yes, Gogh yesterday, dreary, awful, boring herb, dairy, all of them that are atheists totally makes sense. You need religion to be a good person, but you especially need rich, especially in the religion, to be a good artist, you need to pick and choose what you do that you decide is religious and isn't same as his Kim Davis lady deciding that the sins of these men were more important than their own sins or the or. You. Would you want to do ketamine and amphetamines and have just speaking purely here about five at the age of 13 okay? These are all not in the Bible all day. You'll never find hat drag queen fivesome. None of the minute you got to go to the Old Testament.

Speaker 3:          01:52:14       I think you know you're not. You're looking at King James on you. You know, if you, if you actually chat, look at Baltimore. It's right there in Leviticus. I read her the Dead Sea Scrolls. Christian lie with interracial crossdressing orgies. You know, it's, it's right there. It's in my, yeah. That's the thing though, isn't it? Like if you, if you say you're Christian and you want to be on that team to kind of say it Badri veteran than you all aspire to be better than you are. It doesn't mean you believe in Jewish zombies. We're not going to win this one. I'm not going to win this one. Well, of course, you know, this one's ridiculous. This is ridiculous. She talking about shit written on animal skins by people who thought the world was flat and the sun was 17 miles away and you're like, oh yeah, that's going to make you a better person.

Speaker 3:          01:52:57       It's totally, yeah. They found it in clay pots and Qumran yeah, the, and scroll, they had to DNA test to find out which piece of fucking Yak ass on. I feel sorry for people who have a sort of bleak, empty existence that atheist, it's just so boring. Terrible nonsense. Way to look. A lack of belief in nonsense is not bleak. Do you believe? Plenty of nonsense. Like what? Name one thing? Uh, well, you're so silly. You've got a silly view on circumcision. As soon as we've discovered as baby dick cutting my God, free agree or disagree, very nit picky. You're a hell of a fucking drama queen. It's an Ab Dick Cutting. You tell me what it is. Give tell them what is it. If it's not baby Dick Cutting, I'm going to give you just look. You win. I'm just gonna give it too much and you want to brought up the baby.

Speaker 3:          01:53:48       Didn't cutting. Call it. Call it something else. What is it? I think it's good grooming. If aliens from another planet and so I had cut all the baby Dick's, they'd be like, what the fuck are you guys doing? It's just good. It's just good grooming. Okay. Obviously we disagree. What other ridiculous shit do I believe that's a kin to Jewish zombies. You're taught say off at a water. There's nothing more depressing than seeing somebody who you admire who's obviously smart and clever. Old Fairy Tales to speak so disparagingly about such a complex and fascinating part of who we are. You're right. Totally. Even if you, even if you take the view, let's say living flowback, right? Even if you take the Foi Bucky end view, you know, and say, I don't believe in any of these religions say, okay, but if we look at what they have in common and what that says about the human spirit, what we aspire to, what we consider most important.

Speaker 3:          01:54:48       So for example, Christianity, we might consider self sacrifice and love the most important things because the, you know, self sacrifice and love are the two central instincts that the red threads that run through the Christian Canon, Monster Christian literature run to Christian history. That was the most important say is this, okay? I don't believe in this stuff, but this is an essential human, human artifact of human culture and history because it teaches us more about ourselves than anything else, right? It teaches us over centuries, centuries. This is evolved to teach us what we find most important and different religions in different places are fascinating because they illustrate the different emphases on those core values of love and charity and stuff like that. Different societies place on things. Now, I'm not asking you to believe that, uh, that when you take holy communion, you are ingesting the, you know, the body and blood of Christ. That's not going to happen. But what I am suggesting that you shouldn't be such a dismissive asshole about,

Speaker 2:          01:55:44       you know, such an integral, rich, beautiful and crucial part of human history that teaches us so much about who we are. Okay? First of all cases a disingenuous disingenuine sorry, you were mocking me about [inaudible] absolutely. Coming back from the dead healing people turning wine. What I'm saying is even if you only believe their stories, these are the most important stories that were the western tradition symbolization stories, the most important stories that have ever been told about folklore. Even if you believe that they say something deep and profound about who we are and about what we care about most, about our anxieties, about our beliefs and about our, um, you know, our sympathies, the way we relate to one another, the way that that's adorable.

Speaker 2:          01:56:32       I'm presenting one reason why you should be less flippant and dismissive about religion because you are too smart to be that much of a covenant religion. I can't believe it's small. You are far too smart. You are far too intelligent and individual to treat religion with the amount of contempt you do. This is more assholes too. This is not what asked mediocre, mediocre intelligence, zealots, APS, Jews, feminists of doing distorting the argument. What my reality is, we're talking about myths and we're talking about Penn. I'm saved those myths so much that they won't let people get married because it goes against their myth. I'm saying I can disagree with them and that would happen. You can disagree with, you can just pull it right? Where's the love and the Davis. You can disagree with everything that they teach. You can say that it's nonsense. You can agree that you can, if you want to agree that it has bad consequences in society, you shouldn't do is ridicule and dismiss, you know, sort of the, you know, Jewish Zombie Shit, right?

Speaker 2:          01:57:33       You're just doing it to be outrageous. You're just doing what you shouldn't do. And look, there was a good place for it for outrageousness and provocation. Right. And I'm not trying to put you on trial here, but I'm saying is you're too smart to fall into this habit and it's a leftist thing. This militant atheism crap or you dismiss the central importance of religion to our culture is the central importance through barbaric days with rules. What we worried about the consequences of God's punishing. Most of our laws are based on religious prescription. When you get down to it, most of the way society is organized is based on what's ultimately religious prescription. My point is simply and only that if you're going to be a flippant asshole, at least acknowledge that first of all, half the population, you know, it does take this stuff seriously. And second of all, this is important stuff that tells us about who we are. And I think it's beneath you to be so flippant about it. It's about feminism because feminism is not as important. Stein tells us about flippant and cruel and vindictive and spiteful and horrible about crazy feminists because they're crazy. And because what they do is ridiculous. I don't think whether or not you're an atheist, that religion is ridiculous and I think it

Speaker 1:          01:58:42       deserves a bit more respectful. Well that's fine. You're allowed to think of, but just because you think it doesn't mean it's right and the idea that it makes you a flip an asshole because you're unwilling to accept myths, you're unwilling to accept things that make no sense whatsoever. You're unwilling to accept things that are not acknowledging the extent to which religion has made you who you are. I mean, you know from the speech, the rejection codes that you grow up with your moral code spaces doesn't mean stupid. I didn't say. That doesn't mean that what got us to here, you will see ball, your senses, your sense of right and religion, which was created by people's sense of right and wrong bull shit and shit. And it's interesting he's not come from that. That's not very angry. It's not true. Your sense of right and wrong comes from Judy.

Speaker 1:          01:59:35       You got to stop saying that because it's not true. This cultural, there's right and wrong and other cultures had to completely different from what we consider. Right and wrong in America. Look in New Guinea. Do you know what about the sperm warriors in New Guinea? These men that take these young boys when they're young and inseminate them, put common their mouths and their acids to make them grow. They do that from the time they have like, isn't that great? It's their culture. It's, it's what's right and what's wrong for them. Things that would be absolutely illegal would lock you up in jail for in America and in Europe, in New Guinea. This is a great long tradition of this part and then out your day a Christians. It's cultural. Yes, exactly. Christian cultures, many things that you have good values that I agree with the call Shit Bullshit for me, I just made it.

Speaker 1:          02:00:28       You grew up in a basis. Christianity. You're a good person. This place where there's no Christianity, they come and boys mouths. There's one place that has a fucked up way of looking at things. It's a cultural thing. It doesn't have it everywhere. That doesn't have a strong Christian. Heritage is a fucked up place with bad with bad morals. That's a ridiculous statement. That's a ridiculous statement everywhere that doesn't have jail, Judeo Christian values, a fucked up place. I think that, yes, I think, I think you should be perfectly reasonable respectful thing to say our culture is better. I believe our culture is better than the culture of Christian European shares, Ketamine, Ph, other European and American culture, which is based on Judeo Christian values is better than other cultures. I think it's uncontroversial to say so, but what's what, based on Judeo Christian values about being a good person, ultimately all us from the Bible, what it does, what comes from the Bible. Ultimately our sense of right and wrong comes to the Bible, our sense of, right. I think you also see the only way that a person could have ethics and morals and treat each other. I wouldn't say the Pacific. Listen, if we're going to have a conversation, we can't keep talking over each other like this. When someone's trying to make

Speaker 3:          02:01:40       a point about something that's complex like this, if you're, if you think that the only way for a person to have ethics or an understanding of each other or compassion for each other is to rely on ancient myths that are easily, scientifically disproven. Well, that's what Christianity is. No, I didn't say that. That's what the Bible said. This is the specific set of values that you have is influenced more than you would like to admit by your Judaic Christian influenced by all of us. Have, I mean, look, I think that some, some of what we would call morality obviously comes from natural revulsion, which is more like biological, right? Then this is, this is some of the prescriptions against perhaps against murder, perhaps against child abuse, that kind of stuff. Right? It comes from instead of natural revulsion and it may be an evolutionary, biological imperative.

Speaker 3:          02:02:21       There's certain things that we just know we shouldn't do. Right. And that's our body's saying no, like, you know, like the smell of rotten food. You know, it was stuff like that. Yeah. Um, but there are other things that, um, the definitely come from the, from the Judaic Christian tradition has defined most of what we consider to be right and wrong in the west. And I think our society is the better for it. Uh, and I think that our society is better than elsewhere in the world. And your lifestyle is proof positive that that's the evolution of what this used to be or what it is today. Early speaking, I'm an outlier because I mean, as you know, gay people generally test hire for Iq than the rest of the population and lots of evolutionary biologists and we'll suggest that that gate people with high Iq is tend to engage in, um, uh, dissident or unusual habits and practices in general because that's where, um, where mother nature does her experimentations, where she tests the limits of, of, um, of the species.

Speaker 3:          02:03:18       So people with very high Iq are more likely to be homosexual goes the evolutionary biology argument because it's in those very smart people that the sort of the, the transgression and transgressive dissidents stuff has tried out by mother nature. So I would say I'm probably an outlier. There is a very small homosexual. Um, you know I'm not typical of of sort of mainstay of, of of the kind of bulk of the species. Right. But what you are, I mean I might take it to whoever you are but who you are being a gay man who I am, what I do that is this right here but it in the Bible. Yes, but I agree that it would be better if I didn't behave like this and if I could [inaudible] homosexual. No. And I wouldn't have this you need to read is wonderful essay by Bernice.

Speaker 3:          02:04:03       I don't need to read shit. What the fuck you're saying. Okay. So goes what you're saying is who you are is prohibited in the bylaw because I don't think my sexuality is an important component part of you. You talk about it all the time. It's a massive part of what we've talked about on this show I think comes up anytime you want to make a funny point. It comes up anytime you want to do malty or your urges or do well on a few. I think people, I think it's you, what I think people leap to the most, uh, the most different thing about themselves, the most unusual thing about themselves. Anytime they want to be funny or be, um, you know, it's black versus white. Black comedians talk about being black a lot. Chris rock always talks about, you know, blacks and inward. Um, it's why, uh, you know, Muslim comedians only ever talk about Islam.

Speaker 3:          02:04:47       It's, you know, gay comedians talk about being gay. I think that's, you go to that because it's the most different funny thing about you. It's, and it's a sort of, sort of a form of laziness I suppose. Um, so I don't know that's particularly relevant, but, uh, I'll wait. Listen, it's absolutely relevant. Make it bounce to the jokes and a lot of cultures and Muslim culture is not going to use no announced. Um, and it's, it's any of them. It's in the Muslim world that does that. Now. 11 countries continue the grand old tradition of killing gay people. But that shit's been around forever. I mean, what does it say in the Bible about a man lying with another man? I think if I could, I mean, if I could change, if I could choose, I wouldn't be homosexual. That doesn't make me self loathing.

Speaker 3:          02:05:26       So if someone came out and it just made me so Pfizer came out with a pill to make me, no, it doesn't. No, it doesn't make you self loathing to hate a part of what you are a part of what I am. I love all of me, but if I could choose to be even better, then I would be. So you'd be better if you were straight? Yes. Wow. Anybody would be, if Johnson would be better if he was strong and had an anti gay pill. Yeah, you would take it. What? It would be curious suicide, but I probably would. Yeah. Would it be career suicide? You don't think that you could transition into the straight world? You would be the poster boy for Christian. Right? They would love you. Tru, you know, if I were to pray the gay away, I'd be so popular.

Speaker 3:          02:06:02       Super popular. That's what's holding you back is the gay. You're right. Maybe that's, you're intelligent. You're good looking. You're well dressed. It's true. It's true. You're right. Okay. I'm going to, I'm going to enroll in one of these camps again. I'm going to cheat. I'm going to get out the work. They just an excuse for Denise, like Michele Bachmann's husband. You ever heard about the camp that that guy was running? That guy's the greatest or Oregon after hours. How about you say that, but hold up. We'll bring that back. But how about the guy that got arrested? Hillary fucking people at that, uh, that community center killer. Then often many cases, serial killers. I was like, no, he's a KKK guy that got arrested with black prostitutes. Oh yeah, of course he did. Of course he did. Of course. He's my favorite course. I love it.

Speaker 3:          02:06:48       They're out of the grace of God. Go on. Um, so my favorite guys, people who get caught with black prostitutes, I mean literally could, could be me on any first aid, the racist murderers to get caught with blackboard. Those are adorable. I didn't mean at first, but as long as you don't have to have direct contact with anybody, they affected. It's an adorable story. No, obviously I don't, there was a guy look at him. Ah, and you just know that he had like these big black girls whipping him and like raping him with, um, you know, with a Dildo and stuff. You just know that when he was a male sub men, male prostitutes see black male prostitutes Mandingo thing, didn't he? There's a lot going on there. It, I just can't believe that you would, uh, you would decide to not be gay if you could.

Speaker 2:          02:07:36       And is that because of Christian values? No, no, no. So what is it? Uh, I, I don't think it's self loathing to acknowledge that being homosexual is obviously a sort of aberrant sexuality. It's something that Mother Nature does on the fringes and nobody really knows why. And it could be, you know, elegant variation and the evolutionary process. It could be all sorts of things. Who knows the variation, the, something like that. Uh, from a Christian perspective, it could be a test from the evolutionary perspective. It could be a Christian perspective. Some Christians believe that you get these things in life as tests and they don't judge the sinner. They judge the sin and what they mean by that is you can be gay, but if you act on it, that's when you become sin so they don't stay. Don't blame you for who you are.

Speaker 2:          02:08:18       They believe me, they wonder what you'll do is bullshit. You're gay is fun. Presenting the argument, dude, fuck, okay. There's not a God damn choice in the world for you other than being gay. Well you're the perfect example of this shit, this shipping nonsense that it's a choice that somehow or another you're presented [inaudible] you're on. You're on that because I'm actually born this way is an invention of the gay lobby. Once you go back to the science for this, as you guys know base, there is a broad spectrum. There is nice. Actually what I'm going to be very specific because I know you like specificity. There is no basis in science for the born this way argument. There's no basis in science that you are simply born gay and that's all there is to it. What the science suggests is that it is very much nature and nurture and it can, it's as much as 50, 50 in nature and nurture.

Speaker 2:          02:09:13       Right? The gay lobby in the 1980s was worried about, as I finish this one, the gay lobby in the 1980s was worried because religious people were saying that the gay lifestyle lifestyle, it was a sinful choice, right? So they came up with this thing in the gay gene and it is an invention of the gay lobby designed to get around religious bigots. It's designed to, um, to wrong foot to the religious right and suggest that people's sexuality has no, there's no element of choice and people sexuality born this way. You're hearing lady Gaga Song and we take it as good as, as granted as you obviously had no idea that it was even real until you just said the lady Gaga was born this way. Uh, one of her biggest hits, never heard of it. Indeed. Uh, one of her biggest hits is based on an invention.

Speaker 2:          02:09:56       The gala with no basis in science. What the science says is it's a mixture. So it simply isn't true to say that you know, you're just born gay and that's all there is to it. For most people it is a mixture of early environmental factors and natural predisposition. That's the most we can say that's the most, that's with any confidence and with any surety, that's the most that we can say from the available science born this way is a marketing gimmick. It doesn't mean anything. Okay. But when you say that you're, you're talking about, again, a broad spectrum of human sexuality. So some people come part going to be much more nurturing. Some people it's going to be much more nature are born gay.

Speaker 3:          02:10:33       There's a fucking kid that lives down my street, he's five years old and he's gay gaze. Fuck, okay, you might like to play with Asian man, but he doesn't necessarily, he's not necessarily gonna be gay. And I have a problem with you ascribing sexuality to a five year old boy because that's exactly what the transgender parents do. That's exactly when the transgender parents say, my five year old was really supposed to be a girl. You're doing exactly the same thing you're saying he's five years old. He hasn't even hit puberty yet. He has no idea who he is. No idea what he's going to believe. No idea who is going to want to fuck when he's older. He's nowhere near puberty and your saying this kid is gay. You are doing exactly the same thing as these Canadian parents who say that my five year old girl should be a boy.

Speaker 3:          02:11:09       Please give them hormones. You'd be exactly the same. Certainly not. I'm certainly not because I don't want to give anybody hormones and I don't want to influence this guy's life in any way so I'm going to hang back and watch fucking apologize. I will come back to you in 10 years. I will come back on this show. You get him on cause his mom calls him go well his mum is wrong and his mom, his mom is just random everyday Schweppes his ass. She might know he's gay. She knows all the things say is up there. She's not a bad person. She's not a bad person. She's finding things he's put up. There are all black dicks. She doesn't say it in a in a bad way. She just said she's just pretty sure he's gay. You know what actually think he's seven now. I don't particularly like that line of argument.

Speaker 3:          02:11:48       Ascribing sexualities. People that haven't even hit puberty yet, it seems a bit much to me. You'd think that with a lot of people they are gay. I mean Jen is just what they are with you. Some people. No, no. I'm definitely for you made a choice. Definitely 50 50 50 50 so you're well aware of the fact that there is an element of deliberation in my sexuality and that's one of the things that annoys me about the establishment gay left where they insist born this way is on placards and banners and the Texas, the taxpayers, the taxpayers, some but a minority, a minority of people have no choice over their sexuality. Out of the, out of the total number of gay people in minority have no have no choice whatsoever. Nobody else. There is a varying amount of choice. I am aware that there was a degree of deliberation and my sexual orientation, yet I am forced through my taxes to pay for gay pride banners that say born this way.

Speaker 3:          02:12:38       It's just something that you are, yeah, I mean like the way that gay pride stuff is, is financed by the taxpayer in England. Right. It's given, given money by the government. My taxes go to gay pride. People who tell lies in the street stuff that I know isn't true. Medu it basically to get people and they do it in the same bitter, nasty way that paid for a sign that just said it's okay to be gay. Would you be cool though? They do that too and I'm fine with that. Yeah, sure. I don't want my taxes, my taxes to pay for it. Uh, I definitely said born this way and then the asterick some small percentage. Well that would be your kind of, that will be your dreary pick a side, some people that gay comma and then you'd have like a paragraph of text.

Speaker 3:          02:13:17       You know, you wouldn't actually be able to see it from very far away, but your, your version of this gift, this born this way sign. We'd be like, let me start with this online in some circumstances be bought. Do you see this? You see the problem now you to see the problem now, but I'm objecting. I'm just is simply telling people lies born this way is a lie and true story with some of them. Nobody that's holding the signs because most of the ones holding the signs, the militant homosexuals are the ones that chose to be gay to get it. People gays. Does she uh, do, do you have like debates with gay people about their sources? My skates wanting to debate me because they know they'll lose. Well they've got woman brains. Don't worry. Get logic brains. I'm just kidding. You accuse me trolling out here.

Speaker 3:          02:14:02       So I thought I better do it to live up to the reputation. Certainly do. And you're also very aware that uh, you, you are right wing views and the, there was right, right. Kind of a little bit of a right wing Ben to you. You talk about conservatives and dressy events to wear a suit and tie this, this right? Like a good way to align yourself in the club is you have to espouse Christian values or talking about being Christian. Give us stuff about what the conservative establishment thinks of me. If I did, my career would have turned out very differently. I've, I, you know, I would have chosen a very different path through my professional life. You know, I was at the Telegraph and it, you know, the, the most respectable establishment newspaper in England, uh, eight years ago if I'd want it to be, you know, a sign on of the, of the conservative Republican establishment.

Speaker 3:          02:14:50       I could've done that. I did the exact opposite. I've stuck my nose up and my middle finger up at conservatives every available opportunity. I bright, poor, poor Breitbart who put up with so much from me. You know, they published Black Dick Jokes every week from me and that is a direct assault on the kind of stomach churn that the conservative writers or West set to have about gay things. Right? I don't just tell them I'm gay. I tell them I'm sucking Black Dick, right? Really good columns to be funny and entertaining and I'm right to everything. And it also puts them in a very interesting place where they can say, look, we have a gay guy working for us. I tend to think probably about gives us stuff about whether people think that homophobic on all. They certainly wouldn't hire me. The second is everybody. Everybody does trust me, trust me.

Speaker 3:          02:15:32       Right. But doesn't care about, doesn't care if they're not, but they don't care if you do. Right. What they care about is the facts of what they published and the facts, what they probably should, but most of the time I see so strange is someone who believes but doesn't practice. You believe in religion, but you don't practice any of the things that that religious spouses, especially the sexual of the things, but what do you practice that religion? I do most of the 10 Commandments. It's steel. I don't go, we don't cover the wives. No. I mean I probably covered your wife's toxin, but you see what I'm saying? Most of the 10 Commandments. I saw that on most of the 10 Commandments. I except for the gay stuff that's in the book though. God is gonna go. It's gonna look after me. You know, I've got a, I've got a first class ticket to heaven. Well, you know the Moses Come Commandments, the angels, Jerusalem scholars now believe that Moses was high on drugs. You know that, right? I'm sure you've read

Speaker 1:          02:16:30       that. I guess another thing we have in common that Moses, and you don't have any, but yeah, I think it was on different drugs, pills or something. Back then it was acacia. I just be strictly accurate. I have not admitted to anything but the bird, the idea is the idea that the burning Bush was a Bush that was a high and concentrated dod like a k. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah. And that's nice on some kind of awesome pause. Very powerful psychedelic. Well, this is Steve Job says he has these visions of divine inspiration on Lsd, which has enabled him to these very different than dimethyltryptamine. No, dimethyltryptamine is a visionary hallucinogen extremely powerful one. That's the what? IOWASCA that's the active ingredient and Iowasca yeah. Idea is that, that's what Moses was doing. That, that's why the burning Bush, the literal translation of what that episode it was your smoking DMT.

Speaker 1:          02:17:21       He's getting a DMT trip and that's why God is giving him these ideas about how people should behave and be, you know, what, what is divine, you know, to be kind to each other to have a view on that. But um, I suppose it does sound like the product. If somebody on a nice trip, well these are mainstream scholars. They really nice to everyone. Moon. Just like, don't fuck you. Don't fuck someone else's. Whoa dude steel. I carved it out. I mean, you'd have to be quite high on drugs to build, but back then they carved down any idea that they had. They didn't really have any other options. I couldn't make billboards. The state have to pay for it. The Christianity result of a drug trip. I haven't had something today that is a, what some mainstream scholars believe this day. I have. I have, I think, I think I'm right in saying that.

Speaker 1:          02:18:09       I sort of semi read that somewhere and I didn't follow it up, but I will, I will look into that. I'm sure you have. Well, you know John Marco Allegro, the guy who was one of the, uh, head scholars that was deciphered the Dead Sea Scrolls after 14 years of studying. He was a ordained minister, but he was also agnostic because he starts studying religion, realized it was all bullshit, but he wrote a book called the, the sacred mushroom and the cross that he believes that the entire origins of Christianity was based around fertility rituals and the consumption of psychedelic mushrooms fast. That does sound fascinating. Book, obviously Bolex but it does sound fun at all. I mean, he's, he was a well renowned religious scholar. It does. It does. A guy who understood language, he actually trace back the word Christ to an ancient Sumerian word that meant a mushroom covered in God's seaman.

Speaker 1:          02:18:57       She mean the psychedelic mushrooms that grew out of nowhere. They thought that when it rained, it was God coming on the earth and that these mushrooms that would come up and then they would eat them and have these great trips, they thought they were experiencing God. And you can, you can, um, you can generate quite a few extraordinary, um, theories with etymology because 70 words sound like so many other words. So it sounds like an interesting thought experiment and Nice Social Studies paper, but I'm not sure I quite buy it as a explaining. Never looked into it. But if you do look into it, you gotta you gotta assume that we'll look into, I'll write about it. Fascinating. Spectacular psychedelic experiences would be interpreted by the people who had no science, no books, no, no knowledge of what's going on with the human neuro chemistry as being something that was divine you.

Speaker 1:          02:19:42       If you had no other reference point sending right about that. Yeah, I mean, I wouldn't say there's lots of things. There's always things about life in general that would be considered miraculous. I mean the Sun rising childbirth, I'm sure there's lots of things that we can, all those things attributed to the gods. And when these people were on these incredibly powerful psychedelic drugs, they would try to hide this knowledge from the Romans. And so they hid these stories and parables. It's a really fascinating, and by the way, very controversial thing because religious scholars you, you don't say, well it's, this is why one of the reasons why is he was the only one who was an agnostic who was on the Dead Sea Scrolls to ciphering committee, all the other ones where it was really, he was an ordained minister, but he wasn't practicing. All the rest of them were very religious.

Speaker 1:          02:20:26       And so the interpretations that they were willing to accept where not what he was willing to accept. So you would have to get someone of that level of understanding of the language to, to debate him on this and what, I know he's dead, but it's Catholic church, but out the book you can buy it now, but it's like a, well now it got republished a few years ago by this guy named John Irvin and you so you can get ahold of it now, but for the longest time we still have to buy it as a used book. Well, I will look it up. Yeah. This one also the Dead Sea Scrolls, the Christian myth, he wrote a second one after the Catholic Church bought out. The first one stopped production of it and bought out all the books. Yes, your people. Catholics. I tried to hide that information. We're great at pl. They last thing they want.

Speaker 1:          02:21:07       I went to Catholic school, man for a whole year. Cured me, wakes me up. Good. It's where you get you a fine sense of right and wrong from no wait, let's not do that. Well what's right and wrong as far as what anyone's right, what is wrong now I got lucky. They beat me a little smack me a little bit. Lucky you didn't get that taste of no, I said just like I said earlier, if it went from Father Michael, I would have given far less good head. I mean, there was a real father Michael, so much less than he's going to get killed now, but who was father Michael? There's a real dude I should've made me suck his dick for real. Um, I make me, I was going to ask you about it. I thought my English teacher too, but how old was he at the time?

Speaker 1:          02:21:40       Um, I don't know. She's quite young. Quite cohort. Really? Yeah. And so that's where it all started. The Father Michael? No, no, it was that post the tranny. Yeah, it was posted. So it wasn't like I wasn't drag queens a child or anything like that. So, uh, it was quite a, you already had the five. So when like this is all wrong, I need to talk to father Michael. He's like, suck my Dick and shut the fuck up. And you're like, religion is, I really, I really had no hope. Did I? I was, I was, I was never going to end well. Well it seems like you kept stumbling in a Dick's pulling on them through life. I don't know what would have happened if a heterosexual man that he is, I've just been falling on decks. Was in the same circumstances as you early on. I mean obviously things would have went very different, so I'm not sure if I buy the not, you'd go down great. And the gay club go down.

Speaker 3:          02:22:26       Well, I mean, you know, we have an expression you go down well, so go down what it means you would, you'd be popular. You got your attention. Would be like the way you would describe a meal or a drink. Oh, like it goes down. Well, yeah. So No. Um, we like taking the piss. Yeah. Took me a while to get, what the hell do you want? A Cup of mine? Yeah. Which, which again is another thing. Gay people seem disproportionately into their appeal on each other. That seems to be a water sports. So what does the Lord, I'm saying only gay to be transgressive. They choose to be changed to be gay, to be naughty now being a homosexual place. I know Gail. I just can't full Blair myself away. Can't tear myself away. As you get older and you know, she'd drive dries up.

Speaker 3:          02:23:18       I think I would have made a good priest. Do you think I'm making a good priest? I think a bit. Well, you make a good priests. If you think the guy that made you suck his dick was a good priest. That kind of, he was a great priest. Honesty, like he was good. Other than that, I've never had a better senior tutor. He was great singing teacher got notes out of me. I didn't even know I could produce while he worked. Your plumbing shattering, the chandelier's kind of, but was he good outside of what he did? Like was he a good religious scholar? Was he a good parish priest? I mean, I just see she can creep getting his Dick sock then it's going to get lynched now. How's it going to get lynched? Does people, do people know who he is? I didn't think so. What's his name? Well, I'm not saying anymore. I will be you. At the time you were a little kid and he was like, what? You're just trying. You're trying to, was he in his twenties or thirties? Yes. Another feminist strategy that you have adopted in addition to your language, but he says he's trying to turn header files.

Speaker 3:          02:24:09       I told you it wasn't the pedophilia. I was teens. I was in my teens, 14 I was in my teens, something like that. Something like that. Pedophilia, buddy. I don't know how the rocket, and I was very old England. I was in my teens. I'm hearing a my country and never, never seen a 15 year old girl at any point in your life, however old you are, you've never seen a 15 year ago we thought was off when I was 15 no, dude, when you were 25 when you were 13 girls, about 15 you thought, whoa, whoa. No, you did a dental books should be hopping. I didn't want to fucker bullshit. Shut it off. You can't tell me what I was born into. I think if you're 14 you're born this way. You're born a dreary nit picker.

Speaker 3:          02:24:58       Oh, you're trying to make it so I'm a fucking creeper like you. I'm not, I'm not in the 14 year olds. How dare you know? He's a 14 year old fucking, the guy that you said is a great guy. He was in a 14 year old stick. Terrible person. No, surely when I was a very mature 14 year old. Yeah. Well, in your case, he got it right. You've got the right guy to molest. It wasn't molestation and that's absolutely, most of the station is perfectly consensual. I don't think it is when they're 14 when I was 14 trust me, I was the predator. I was the Predator, the Predator chasing after the crease. He's trying to stay close to God, seeing everybody I was, I was aggressively seeking out sexual company of adults because I knew it would horrify people because I wanted sort of power over them.

Speaker 3:          02:25:41       It was my way of rebelling, my way of rebelling. I was, I was the Predator of 14 let me tell you, do you think that's what's going on with that guy who directed x men? Bunch of Bryan singer, a bunch of 14 year old predators. Yeah. After that. Poor man. I, I'm not sure it's the case with him. No, that's a guy know I lived in Hollywood a while ago briefly. And did you go to one of his parties? I went to other people who I won't name of a similar stature in Hollywood. I went to the both parties into their house parties and things and some of the things I have seen, it beggars belief. Yeah. Can you give us like a, well, just, I can't, I don't want to be indiscreet about specific people because I think it's going to dance around the facts.

Speaker 3:          02:26:24       Yeah. Dangerous. But I can tell you the truth without dropping anyone in it. Okay. And some of the boys that were very young, very young, I don't necessarily remember, no, no. Like, I don't know, eight years ago, um, I don't, I don't remember whether I ever met Bryan singer or whatever or even knew who he was then. But I knew other people of similar stature, as I say. And there were some very young boys around at that time. There was a lot of drugs and a lot of, a lot of twinks taking drugs and having unsafe sex with older men. And some of these boys were very young, desperate, desperate for a job. You know, when Andy Cohen, the Guy Runs Bravo, had apologize for the use of the word twink apologize for Twain. I thought that was one of the most adorable things. Gay, gay as fuck.

Speaker 3:          02:27:10       And he said the word twink and he had to apologize because what? Cause it was demeaning to somebody starts, someone was like a perfect twink and he made like a social media comment. Nothing. Nothing's wrong with that. I got you. See this, this is the thing you see, the progressive's are starting to police homosexuals lang. You know, I've got this theory right. Um, I believe that, um, pedophilia is the next progressive rehabilitation drive. But I also think that straight, sorry, that homosexual white guys are going to be put back into the establishment bucket very soon. If you look at some of the whining editorials coming out was like the daily beast, um, this female female columnist and the daily beast who will, who will publish things about seeing it on your Grindr profile, this app that you use to pick up guys nearby, which is best just to see if torsos and you just pick or you want to get fucked by its correct.

Speaker 3:          02:28:02       Jesus would've planned that. I feel like the iPhone and I don't use it for that reason, not for that reason. I don't use these. I don't need to. Um, but uh, on that, um, on the APP, some people say whites only. Some people say only Hispanics. People just express their sexual preference. Everybody has a sexual preference. It's perfectly reasonable. But of course, you know, there's some progressive column is just finally like five years later as cottoned onto this and decided to make a thing about it and said, problematic that gay people express racial preferences in dating. Of course it isn't. We will have the Okcupid data actually shows us which racism, which genders, um, you know, come out on top and come out of the bottoms like Asian women do very well, black women really badly. Um, you know, and the sort of league tables of, of of hotness a minimum.

Speaker 3:          02:28:42       Anyway. Um, so the sign to police the language now and there's police, the sexuality of homosexuals. I mean there was me thinking we were sliding dangerously close to tolerance and understanding and now progressive's are starting to police the sexuality of homosexuals again. Um, very interesting. There's a game of Gotcha though. It's a chemo scarred shirts so they don't really, they're not really upset that they're not upset. They're looking for something to complain about. But the problem with the prom with outrage culture, I mean, I've always said the only part where age, culture is what it is, right. And the problem without any way to approach outrage culture, which is what I do, is to be outrageous, right? Say Ridiculous and outrageous things simply to draw attention to the people to get upset about it. I think it's a very important project and it's what I do in a lot of my columns.

Speaker 3:          02:29:27       That's what I do on Twitter. I've done it a little bit today. Um, and I think it's very important to wait a minute. You've done a little bit of it today. I've been outrageous. Haven't said anything I believe, but I've been outrageous. Going to read you something outrageous, little bit outrageous. Um, just a little bit. I've turned myself down for you. Cause I know, can heterosexual lump lumping Cretia threatened me? No, I've, I've, I've taken, I've toned myself down with you today, but, um, no, I, I very, very firm believer that the only appropriate response to outreach culture is to be outrageous. But the problem with outreach culture is that, uh, because these people are all basically quite thick, um, they tend to move in herds and so outreach culture can have, um, trends, you know, and so, uh, people can sort of cottoned onto a particular idea and suddenly everybody's outraged about the same thing.

Speaker 3:          02:30:15       And I see ahead of us, um, sort of policing of the culture of heterosexual gay men, heterosexual, gay, sorry. Sorry, sorry. Sorry. Of of white gay men. Um, on the basis that they have, uh, almost like the ultimate male privilege, you know, they're not there. They are smarter and richer and better looking and Saskia and, uh, all the things that feminists hate because feminists are none of those things as feminists are disproportionately poor and ugly and unlovable. Um, and uh, and they disproportionately poor. Yes. Yes. Because, well, because the liberals put me in a poor, ugly, miserable, broken people are much more likely to become liberal. What's the percentage that don't have a natural hair color? Oh, close to a hundred. Do you know, do you know I've got, I went to this, I went to the salon today and I said, Gee, I'm going on.

Speaker 3:          02:31:02       I'm waiting on this show. I think it'd be really funny if you gave me like blue hair cause we can make a joke out of it. And he just looked at me and went, no, you're too handsome guys. 18 eight on Santa Monica. Um, no, I thought it was nice. That gave me a lot spring in my step. That's beautiful. No, I'm not doing that to you. You're too good looking. I really know. It's adorable. I know. I know. I know. I tips huge. Which I guess was the point. I guess it was the point he was, he was gunning for. Um, he also gave me my first, you'll appreciate this as a real man. Um, he gave him my first ever cutthroat shave. Oh, well, it's one of those straight razors. Yeah. Yeah. I've never had it done before. I felt like I became a man today.

Speaker 3:          02:31:36       Real men don't do that because you don't trust a man with a fucking razor blade. You don't need because you've got it. There's no, there's no maneuver where you can get it. Yeah. You don't want it like a martial art. There's no, she's fucking crazy. Yeah. Where there was a guy, I believe it was in San Diego that just slit someone's throat for no reason. Just went crazy and just went crazy. Yeah. And they arrested him. The person lived though, but they're fucked up. I, they have surgery and like, he's a guy just sliced open their throat. I was petrified that he would slip or that someone would make him jump or somebody would just come in the store. It's like turning around and get earthquakes here. Cut My throat open, you know, they can just get a razor. I watched San Andreas earthquake, so I watched San Dress on a plane over what happens to San Francisco is just awful really?

Speaker 3:          02:32:20       And so dress. Yeah, it's just terrible. It's awful to see San Francisco brain when you watch that movie is even worse. I like him. What's his name? Yeah, he's great. He's awesome. I'm a fan actually. I've seen pretty much everything he's been in. And do you know what that movie, he's actually kind of good actor in that, like he's quiet, but like with this stuff with his daughter at the beginning when the mom's moving into the house with the new guy who did the boss did, he runs away. Motherfucker, I need your phones away and leaves her in the course. He does pussy. What happens when probably British acts pretty it. British actor. They're always about going male feminist palsy. Probably male feminist. Yeah. Uh, and um, no, and I thought his acting was subtle. I thought it was really point. I thought it was a great performance, but it was great.

Speaker 3:          02:33:02       It was great. I can do everything you want. It's pretty cool. That movie sucked. I just liked seeing San Francisco, like pummeled with waves, too many games, natural disasters, the solid self hate that you could be. You could be, you, you'd like to be there in an orgy when the big one hits God, take me away. Well, maybe taking another way of earthquakes. Tsunami, San Francisco. So all evil in America that comes in your butt tsunami takes you away. I've never been propelled forward by it. Not yet. Yeah. First time for everything. Maybe we, I dunno, you're in San Francisco, so yeah, that's how we do it though. Some street fat you'd get propels and I think get repelled. Just the viral load that's inside that person's body. Boom. I always wanted to just have days at t on tap in the hipster bars in San Francisco for the ECT. Really worked. That was like the big conspiracy. That AZT was a cancer medication, that they were using an aids when they thought it was the gay cancer. They stopped AZT a long, long, long time ago. My, so much so that there was a kindness, my gauge of sort of like 80s bigotry. I'm totally, I'm totally out of date or my gay hate. There was a guy named Peter though

Speaker 1:          02:34:18       I had him on the podcast and Mandy's very few people I've ever had on the podcast that brought so much hate with them. But yeah, he is a biologist at the University of California, Berkeley, uh, tenured fucking professor up there who, uh, believed that HIV did not cause aids and that what HIV was, was a weak virus that, uh, only existed in the bodies of people that already had compromised immune systems. And he said the correlation between partying and a party drugs, crystal meth dream and all this different shit. This is what drives you into the eye. It's just what could crushes your immune system. It's really amazing. Academics believe we have this extraordinary reverence for science and of course we do, right? Yeah.

Speaker 2:          02:35:01       Because it's what tells us mostly about how the world works. Python I've see from, you know, the transcendental bits that are actually met her. Uh, but it tells us, it tells us so much about how the world functions, you know, like what's going to happen if I do that? Uh, you know, science tells us all these things, right? And, um, so we have this, I suppose, appropriate reverence for scientists, but what we always forget is just how mentor and fallible and in many cases unintelligence then many of them are. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          02:35:25       Oh, there people, they vary so widely to change stuff. You know, dark secret that I never tell anyone, which I'm going to reveal to you. You don't believe in climate change. Oh No, no. I'm perfectly happy, but I haven't even met McClemmits first motherfucker. No, I don't believe in manmade climate change at all. But you don't know. You don't believe in it? No, I don't think it's, I don't think, I don't think we are affecting the climate significantly. No, no, no. So all those scientists, they don't know what the fuck they're talking about. Well, this is my dark secret.

Speaker 2:          02:35:52       So for two years, nobody knows this. I'm going to lose. I'm going to, this is going to be the, my last shred of conservative credibility. Gone off to this show. I worked for a climate change NGO. Uh, and um, I saw at the u I went to the UN, I was in the front row for Al Gore speech host in Barley, let, all the UN stuff. I went to all their events and I saw firsthand just what a load of what a crock of shit. So much of it is really, I mean, look, we now know the IPC reports in the UN are total horse shit. Lead authors are asking for the names to be removed from them now because they've turned into just into ideological political documents. They have no basis in climate science whatsoever anymore. But even in the early days when, uh, when they were supposedly better, I saw, um, papering over of data. I was asked to do it and I didn't. I saw, um, people emitting, uh, uh, data sets that didn't fit with the, with the, um, uh, hypotheses. I saw people getting reports, some scientists, and rewording them to make them more extreme and more alarmist. I saw all of this happened, um, and I saw all this happen in multiple organizations whose sole purpose was to, was to, um, the extremist about climate change. And I, I came to believe that the whole thing was, um, was a crock of shit and I left

Speaker 1:          02:37:13       quit. Do you think that what happened? I mean, I

Speaker 2:          02:37:16       know very, very, very little on this. I'm just gonna just take this at face value and just debate you and not in debate. You just ask you questions. Yeah. Do you think that what is happening is that an industry has been created? Uh, and that certainly is true that there is an industry, I'm not going to suggest that the whole climate change establishment as a result of some people rent seeking where there is some of that going on, but there is definitely a climate change industry. There's no doubt about it. Right. And it also is one, it's something that if you, it's like saying that you don't believe in vaccines. No, I don't think it's the same. You look, but, um, but it is to public opinion. No, I don't think that's true. I think, I don't think so. Opinion. Well, you never hear about it because the media will never dare tell you a bit more skeptical about many of the same people who don't believe in climate change also.

Speaker 2:          02:38:01       Anti-Vaxxers right. But I don't think these two things have anything in common. And one of them is right. One them is wrong. Um, you know which one's wrong? Anti-Vaxxers right. Or rule should vaccinate their children. Right? And climate changes bunk. Um, but if you need to say that, you don't need to believe in climate change, a lot of times the same sort of believing Wacko. I don't care what they bought, lump me in with. I care about facts not being, you know, not whether somebody lumps me in with the wrong group of people. I've never cared about that. I don't care what people think about me. I care whether, whether my argument is sounded, whether I'm right or whether I'm funny and entertaining people like me. But, um, I don't care if somebody, you know, but people are people, right? Guys like us off all the time.

Speaker 2:          02:38:39       Right? They said, write me, I was in Miss [inaudible] self-loathing, homosexuals you did. You did today on wrongly, you know people do this all the time and it's just another way that the left has of dealers utilizing the speaker because they don't like the arguments. Rather than take the argument you called the speaker self-loathing rather than take the argument you call the speaker, you know a bigger to have some other kind, you know what, what all you pathologize you say that if you're a gay person with these opinions you must either have like some psychological problem and you get for you need therapy or you hate yourself and your self loathing because of your religious upbringing or the rest of it. You don't allow that person the dignity of having opinions that don't correspond with their sexuality. That I think is cheap and it ignores the messy and complicated reality of human sexuality and who people are.

Speaker 2:          02:39:18       I don't care if somebody thinks that I'm a self loathing homosexual. What I care about is, is telling the truth that other people seem to be reluctant to do gay people, the gay establishment and uh, you know, certainly doesn't tell the truth about a lot of things. They don't tell the truth about born this way. They don't tell the truth about HIV. They get very upset when you dare to told, you know, I wrote this column like you know, gay people, if you want to start donating blood, cause most gay people, gay people are banned from donating blood, you know, or at least it's very difficult in the UK and I think the u s too, and I wrote this column, so if you want it to gay people are complaining that they're not allowed to donate blood and they said that it's, you know, evidence of homophobia, whatever.

Speaker 2:          02:39:50       I said if you, if you don't, if you want to be able to donate, blood stopped being sluts. The reason that the, the reason the NHS doesn't let you donate blood, it's because gay blood is so disproportionately more likely to have diseases in it. If you want, if you want to be allowed to donate blood, stop sleeping around and this kind of stuff, stop sleeping around just so they can give other people, it's not, but that wasn't the point. My point was to, you know, to get it, the, the whiners, the winches and the social justice

Speaker 3:          02:40:14       warriors and handling it. My point is I don't care if somebody says, you know, you're still floating homosexual. I know, which isn't true. It's a cheap debate tactic. Um, and it hasn't really has no meaning outside of the fact that the argument. Um, so I didn't care about being lumped in with, with crazy people. If my arguments are sound about a particular issue, I'd rather it wasn't. But you know, Auntie Auntie, if you say to me, will you come and you say, I didn't believe in climate change. And in my head I think, Oh God, you're like, it can get crazy info wars conspiracy theorist. You're an Alex Jones type, right? Who probably thinks vaccines are a conspiracy by the government. Um, I find that absurd. And in any case, I don't really mind too much because I think, I think ordinary people, I think many of your fans and certainly mine are a bit tired of having labels applied to them by other people.

Speaker 3:          02:40:58       I think people are a bit tired of being told what they are that told their bigoted, told them a sergeant stick, told the um, you know, that there is something else wrong with them or that they have the wrong opinions about things. I think people are a bit sick of that actually. Um, and uh, indeed, um, you know, I think people are a bit bored of that. So I'm very relaxed about people calling me names because I've had it my whole career and normally it's a consequence of telling the truth. Got It. Um, you know, there's a lot of articles. It's really interesting because I googled it while you were talking about the, you know, there's a quote that gets bandied around a lot, a 97% of climate scientists agree. And, uh, there's a lot of fucking articles it says that's horse shit. I don't think that's true.

Speaker 3:          02:41:39       I don't think that's ever been true. I think the 97, I think that 97% of climate scientists agreeing on climate change is in the same category of, um, of immortal myth that the campus rape culture, statistically, it's one of those sort of unquestioned, it's like a, it's become a, it's become a, a fact meme, you know? Uh, it's one of those things as uncritically reported and it's been repeated so many times that people don't even feel the need to us for a citation anymore. And so for example, when you hear this stuff about the rape rape statistics or the pay gap, people take it, it's such an established part of accepted a statistic. Now people's have stopped bothering to ask for evidence to justify it. I don't think it was ever true. Then. I just 7% well, you would know probably better than a lot because you were actually there on the front lines and you watched people actually fuck with evidence and omit things and add things and, well, what, what was the, when, when you were there, and this was all going on, like what was the philosophy behind politics?

Speaker 3:          02:42:38       It's all politics. Climate change has never been about science. It's always a bit about politics. Um, you know, and this is, this is, this is when right wing or sometimes sound a bit conspiratorial, a bit crazy, right? Won't miss it. Oh, it's all construction. The liberal. So 97% of scientist is a construction of liberals. Just guests get out. Right. I understand how that conversational moment comes to happen, but my more I can tell you is that it was climate change for me as an observer. Lu for the scientists concern, it was primarily a political project. It was a lot to do with the, the sort of UN global guilt about poverty and the third world climate change was this issue. We're going to fix everything,

Speaker 2:          02:43:11       right? It was going to fix poverty in third world. Uh, you know, it's finally addressed the sort of white guilt. They all feel and gave them all a real reason to feel bad about being who they are. Um, you know, it gave them that, uh, that sort of terrible, um, you know, you get it gave them the justification to beat up on capitalism, which they all hate, gave them a justification to beat up on, you know, a western way of life. And my James Delingpole, my Breitbach colleague wrote a book about watermelons green on the outside, red on the red on the inside. And his point was that his thesis is that, you know, dressed up in the language of environmentalism and climate change concern is actually just socialism, you know, anti-capitalism uh, it's sort of this, this weird, an archaic, um, desire to see cds. The developed world burn on the part of very politicized scientist. And I have to say, based on what I saw, he's right.

Speaker 1:          02:43:59       Well, it still seems like it's a very high number when they're breaking down. Um, there's a skeptical science article about it and they break down the actual number of scientists that do believe that we have something to do with global warming. I mean, ultimately this is a large number, but ultimately the debate pointless anyway. You know, most of, you know, there, there are a million, well, top point is, but it's, there are millions of us

Speaker 2:          02:44:23       was about climate change and the, and with one Google search, you can't hope to get anywhere even close to the truth. But um, in any case, it's a good idea to get off fossil fuels simply because going to run out, it's a question of energy security, not conservation. For me, I think for many conservatives who agree that we have to find other solutions, whether it's wind or nuclear or something else, right? Um, just drilling and using up all the oil is going to, I mean, it's going to run out eventually, right? It's going to run out. So we need to better select, we need something else in the wings that can take over. That's, that's not a question of ecology. And that's not a political question either. It's just basic energy security, making sure that we all have what we need to survive and that we can all keep our lights on. Right. Um, so for me it's not, you know, there is a heavily politicized and I think primarily political and not scientific issue, but um, we should in any case, be pursuing renewable energy because one day we're going to have to, even with shale gas, which is going to fix us for another 100 200 years or something, you know, it's going to run out eventually and we are going to be around when it does.

Speaker 1:          02:45:21       I believe that, I always find it very disturbing when people bring up this whole fracking thing and they're very dismissive of it. That that one freaks me out because there's absolute evidence that they've poisoned a lot of wells and there's areas that people can't live in anymore, that it's leaked into river supplies. There's absolute evidence of that. And then people like, well, the bill, look how cheap the gas is now. I'm like, it doesn't matter if you fuck something up to the point where it's useless a hundred thousand years from now, it doesn't matter. The poisoned to river, it doesn't, I mean you made it, supports it. The EPA, EPA would say that doesn't mean there shouldn't be any EPA just because they fucked up and poisoned the river. Right. Just because one fracking well fucked up or even three, four time fracking or 10 out of a thousand a thousand maybe there needs to be better at betting regulation. Maybe they need to do they think maybe they need to do it differently? I guess the fracking, I have idea actually more than a million.

Speaker 3:          02:46:10       I've been totally out of that climate. Energy stuff years. Yes. Right now I'm going to say friendly in wells and 100,000 how many million? Well, fracking worlds. You're kidding, right? In America? No, a million fracking host in America. That's insane. Yeah. In America they call it possibly be. I think it's more than that actually. 1.1 million active tus. Yup. I'm stunned, but don't understand how my country roles. So in that case, you could, I mean, you could present hundreds of examples of poisoned rivers. It will still be set, but it still will be significantly insignificant because [inaudible] still needs that need to get in. If there's 1.1 million of these wells and you're only, you could, and there were a hundred scare stories in the media every year. That hundred is a relatively small number if you're looking at statistics. But if you're the actual human beings that live anywhere near the nuclear power, you could say people die in nuclear accidents.

Speaker 3:          02:46:58       So let's don't have the kind of people do. But they were even that many nuclear actually didn't even a, well, they're are traction. There are nuclear accidents in Japan are Unisex since, you know, in, in, in Russia. Um, well there's two and three mile island. Right, which is, which is, which is, well, probably comparable, comparable, comparable in numbers of people affected to your fracking thing. No, we don't live in a perfect world. We have to make a risk assessment and a judgment and also price comes into it. You know the cost and the amount of the benefit to society of getting all of this natural gas right? If a couple of rivers of poisons, we may say that that is the best of a bad set of solutions right now. None of this stuff is perfect because we don't live in mud huts. We want Nice Shit.

Speaker 3:          02:47:38       You know, you want your cameras, you want the Internet, you won't computers. You want to read a producer with seven buzzing devices next to him that comes at a price, right? There's an energy cost to that. And if you want that, you're going to have to get it from, you're going to have to get the power from somewhere and none of those solutions are going to be, things are going to like, it's either drilling for it's Middle East oil. Well, sure. I think we should invade. As Ann Coulter said in the country's killed their leaders, convert them to Christianity, which she also said, well, she also said, who is he? And coulters. So did you say he also said, no, I didn't. I said, I said, she also said we should invade their country's killed the leads and convert them to Christianity. He became a man. What if she became a trainee and see the ankle to whatever, become a man.

Speaker 3:          02:48:19       She's a beautiful woman. How dare you lie to the Ma America, the world? I can't imagine you are a right wing shill. You Saddleback church. We really are supportive of fracking. You love circumcision. I love ankles. Um, I think she's tremendous. I know I do. And do you know what I do? She falls into the same bucket you do. And I do. And Trump does. She is. No, she's not troll. You could characterize, you could characterize much of what both of us do is just trolling. I don't trust them. I don't tell me what I do with trolling. Go ahead. Viewers will make up their own judgments on that one. I'm not a tome fine. Okay. If you're not a trial, that's fine. I may say inflammatory things, but I believe them. I don't mean to meet you. So where do I go? [inaudible] shit about Mexicans.

Speaker 3:          02:49:05       I don't think she believes that I am. I wanted to persuade you, Kipp, which is closest thing we have to equipment, the tea party. I want to persuade Ukip in the UK who were banned from the pride march because of course the leftists, Houma, homosexual establishment are nothing, if not a ruthlessly intolerance of conservatives. It was much more difficult for me to come out as a Tory that it wasn't a gay person. Um, uh, Tory being a conservative and much more just got to come out of the Conservatives. Is that then it must have been gay. Um, right wing, like I said, write me. It's very difficult. Uh, I wanted Ukip, who's, I could look at the tea party to, um, to, uh, go all dressed in drag as Margaret Thatcher and have signed, we'll have signs, things like, um, I've lost my thread. Uh, I lost my to say we've been talking for a very long time.

Speaker 3:          02:49:50       Um, what were you talking about? Um, gay people. I've lost it. Let's go to the UK and I've lost it. It's gone. It doesn't matter. Trolling. But now I've got, I've got, I've got a troll. It's gone. It's done. You were accusing me of trolling, it can be trollish as quarter. Ken, as Donald Trump is, um, where I think we can all be trollish and it's it being provocative and outrageous saying things you believe in. Um, the, the definition of trolling is expanded to cover that. Now it's become essentially meaningless word like racist. Well, it's also dismissal word. It's like, you know, when someone calls you a sexist or someone calls you a bigot, they'll call you. And I think what we all do, all four of us, is we say thing, we gin up our jokes and our rhetoric and our provocation to get attention and to draw attention perhaps to people who are unnecessarily offended by things that they shouldn't be offended by two idiots.

Speaker 3:          02:50:42       But in the course of doing so, we do tell the truth what we really believe in. Now, you may be the sort of least on that spectrum that probably starts with you and ends with Trump. Your probably, you know, the least trollish but you still do it. Hmm. Interesting. Well, I think it's part of the countercultural spectrum. You know, if people, if people, you know, you're not part of a right wing establishment media, you're your own thing. You are, you know, you fall, um, I think very squarely into that category we talked about earlier. You know, that sort of, I think many of the people who like each of us, uh, have the same, you know, that we have, we have a big overlap I think of, of, of, of our listeners and fence. Yeah. So I think we do too. Yeah. I'm trollish in some, here's one like what I said earlier about tweeting about male feminists choking to death on Vegan. Peter. That's clearly true but offensive. It just strikes me, it strikes me as good government policy.

Speaker 3:          02:51:33       Um, we just did three hours, man. Shit. Really? That was it. And we could have done another three easily when going to come to blows once on the gay stuff. That's what's fun. It's fun when people die. We got more heated about Christianity than anything. Yes we did. Because you're a militant atheist. Refused to extend that even an easy, except the obvious truth that your your, here's the thing, this is where people can't get wrong. Get me wrong. I am not an economist. I'm not, I'm not, I don't even, I wouldn't even class. And you know what,

Speaker 1:          02:52:05       as anti I'm just, I don't believe people, I think people are full of shit. And when I read a story that's full of Shit, like look at, first of all, I know too much about the construction of the Bible. I know too much about the new testament. I know Constantine and a bunch of bishops constructed it and decided what to leave out. I know Constantine didn't even become a Christian until right before he fucking died. Okay. I know that the original Bible was written in ancient Hebrew and to this day there's a fucking shit ton of words in ancient Hebrew that they have no idea what the hell they mean. Not only that, they an ancient Hebrew letters double as numbers. There were no numbers. So the letter a was also the number one, there's a numerical value to words and sentences that was completely lost in the translation to Latin and Greek and eventually English.

Speaker 1:          02:52:49       I know that you're a well read and passionate on the subject, so let's move on. We can't move on. It's, I'm not even, I'm not anti God. I've had so much flat a great, it's been great. Thank you for having me on man time ever in town again. Let's do it again. We could probably be, you can be sure. I'll be back. Uh, I think that's my next sentence then we could do what? I really like it guest, we can do 180. I've had a lovely time. And when you come to London, um, make sure you let me know and I'll say absolutely. I'm usually in London like once a year. Um, how often do you mean house Angeles? I think I'm going to be around a lot more now. Someone's got something cooking, which I can't quite tell you that I have a little, I have a little announcement coming in the next seven days, which, um, uh, will draw me to the u s much more often. Well, listen, you're a lot of fun. Your articles are fantastic. I really enjoy it. Your Twitter feeds great. Check it out. It's Nero, the one that killed all the Christians that is evil, that evil. Do that. So regulations are getting that as a Twitter handle. That's an excellent friends in low places. Excellent catch. All right. That's it ladies and gentlemen. We'll be back tomorrow until then. Go Fuck Yourself. So I ride up by,

Speaker 4:          02:54:03       yes.
