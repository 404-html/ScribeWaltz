Speaker 1:          00:00:00       Could even hear their breathing. It's a sensitive. Yeah. It's good stuff.

Speaker 1:          00:00:09       Lab already. Damn. There's no countdown. Jamie. You're radical. Radical. Mr Goes in. Go back to be here. Thanks Mr Lindsay. Good to James or Jim depending upon preferences. That's right. Go with Jim a jet. First of all gentlemen. And there was one other person that you did this with. This whole project. Helen pluck rose from England. A shout out to Helen from England. She back across the pond, right? He's across the pond. Fish and chips and she's making tea and managerial magazine. That's great. Excellent. Alright, well shout out to her as well. Um, let's explain what you guys did and what's so significant about it because when I first read it, my first inclination that I had two reactions. One was a huge laugh. I laughed really hard and then I said thank God so many exposed this. Yup. So tell me, tell me what you guys do over. Let's explain who you guys are, what you do. Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:01:09       Um, my background is in mathematics. I bailed out an academia in 2010 though because I kind of see the writing on the wall and uh, so now I am a renegade gender scholar and I write nonsense about genitals.

Speaker 1:          00:01:23       That's primarily what I do. I mean, I manage a business at home, so I got to academia. Yeah. And I'm uh, uh, I teach philosophy of Portland State University and uh, met Jim years ago, we collaborated and we've written a number of things over the years and at some point it just came to the, we had to do something about this. It was just too ridiculous and it was translating into the real world. And so we collaborated and here we are. Well, let's explain what you did and what was ridiculous. Um, what we're talking about, what was ridiculous is there's many fields of studies, um, that you can get legitimate degrees in that are absolutely preposterous, right? Literally filled with nonsense, taught by nonsense. People who live in these nonsense bubbles, right? And then they give these degrees and these people go out in the real world and they infect things. They in their, their ridiculousness infect certain, particularly tech industry businesses like you see it in King James. Yeah. Well it's explained what you guys did.

Speaker 2:          00:02:33       Yeah, so we started about a year, I guess a year and a half ago now is last summer. We started writing a bunch of academic papers for the journals that represent these fields and so everybody understands what an academic paper is getting out of the gate. This isn't like an op Ed that you dash off or like Washington Post or some magazine or whatever. This is a thing like academics work their careers to write one or two of these a year. And so they're really hard to write. They're supposed to be hard to get published. So we were up 20 of them in 10 months and uh, seven of those got accepted for, were actually published. And um, then we got lost for more. Yeah, we got busted and at least four more. We're on track. Maybe five or six more would've gotten in. What's the difference between getting accepted and getting published?

Speaker 2:          00:03:20       So the process with everything in academia is really slow and a lot of people don't know this, so you send off this article, the editor looks at it and the editor either gives it the thumbs up or the thumbs down. If they give it the thumbs up, it goes off to peer reviewers and that process takes months often as long as I mean would one paper that was eight months under peer review. So the reviewers look at it, they try to figure out if the arguments are good, they try to figure out if the research is good, they evaluate that, they give extensive comments, they send it back to you, then you have to revise it according to whatever they say. Make it better is what's supposed to happen. They made ours crazier and so then they did. Every single time

Speaker 3:          00:03:59       we took the feedback and made the papers just the most extreme,

Speaker 2:          00:04:02       most extreme things and so then you send them back. So now you're probably three, four months in just the review process, not to the writing, which should also take months. And then the editor will either send it back to the reviewers to see if it was good enough or they'll just evaluated themselves depending on where it stands and then they'll make a decision as to whether or not to accept it or reject it or ask for more revisions. And then when they accept it, that means the is ready to publish it. But then the publishing process requires all the typesetting, proofing, all the stuff that goes into making it professional for an academic journal. And that can take months

Speaker 3:          00:04:37       and, and, and publishing is the coin of the realm like fats it. So the ideal is one paper every year in the humanities probably. So if you, that's how you credential yourself. That's how you get tenure, which is a job for life. That's how you get to teach people these ideas who then, as you said, go out into the workforce, you know, five, six years later. And in fact everybody with total silliness. So the, it's the gold standard peer review. So we saw a tremendous problem. Can we tell people some of the titles of these charter? Because right now they're like, what the hell are these guys talking?

Speaker 2:          00:05:13       So we had a article, the one that got the most press was about dog humping and Portland, Oregon. It was called. How did it go? Was it called um, queer performativity and uh, was it rape culture, rape culture? We're performativity in dog parks in Portland or.

Speaker 3:          00:05:29       Yeah, we claim to have examined under a fake name is formativity. Oh yeah, totally. Have their own lingo. Their own, you know. But is that a word in the English language before

Speaker 2:          00:05:40       activity? I mean in the academic English language. Not In common parlance, but that's like the whole thing. This is huge, right? This goes back a long way. That's Judith Butler. His whole thing was that gender different? Butler. Judith Butler is probably the most influential feminist scholar there. Gender scholar I should say, that that's been in maybe the last 30 years. She's, she's big time. And so she had this whole thing that gender is performative. It's something you perform. It's not something that has anything to do with your biology treated article. Reactions to rape culture in Queer performativity at urban dog parks in Portland, Oregon. Why is it retracted? Because it's because I realized bogus. We're hosing them, we reactions to rape culture and queer performance. We claim to have closely examined the genitals of just under 10,000, 210,000 dogs and then interrogated their owners as to their sexual orientation.

Speaker 2:          00:06:35       So we checked out the dog's nuts and then said, excuse me sir, are you gay? And if they gendered their dogs, well we made up these totally insane, you know, dogs humping incidents and how they, they beat female dogs but they didn't beat male dogs. So that's one of the papers that we made, you know the other paper that will, will this one also, they had the whole thing like if a male dog humps another male dog, especially men would freak out and break it up. Stop that because that's the queer performativity part. But then if a male dog humped a female dog, they'd be like, you know, get her girl. Get her, get her, you know, get on it. You're basically raging against Hetero normativity. Exactly correct. We told them exactly what they wanted to hear and we gave them bogus statistics to fuel what they already wanted to believe.

Speaker 2:          00:07:23       Yeah. We started off with the idea that what we wanted to get to as a conclusion and then we made up all the crap in between to get to it and the conclusion was feminism should train men the way we train dogs so that we can get rid of rape culture. They'll put them on leashes, you know, it's right in the paper. It's all there. Unfortunately we cannot put them in Aleisha. It's not politically feasible to put men on leashes. You guys wrote that. He had told their leashes when they misbehave in this paper, didn't just get published. The Journal said that this was exemplary scholarship and gave it an award.

Speaker 2:          00:07:56       So it was one of the best pieces. This year is their 25th anniversary. So this journal's has been doing this for 25 years and it's their 25th anniversary. So they're picking out the best papers. So pull year and putting them, you know, pride of place in some, some issue of the journal and ours was going to be in the seventh issue was so number one is greater, it's not great. So it either is greater, it's not great like why they retracting it because they know we were bogus. So what? Like a broken clock. The clock is broken, what it is actually 12:00. So they would claim it's incorrectly that we fabricated statistics but we, we wrote other paper's called one was fat bodybuilding, so that claim that there should be a category introducing traditional body building called fat body bodybuilding where people come and display their fat before the audience and we didn't manufacturing and statistics for that and they love that.

Speaker 2:          00:08:54       They thought it. You know, one line in that paper was a fat body is a built body of the reviewers. Like I wholeheartedly agree. Something like that. Yeah. And then we wrote other papers like to Hypatia we published a paper, got accepted, not published, but that one we claim that it's unacceptable. It's honestly, it's unethical to make fun of anything to do with social justice. Right? And so if you want to make fun of things that don't have anything with social justice, that's good. So if we wanted to make fun of men, that's great. If you want to make fun of white people, that's great. If you want to make fun of anything to do with social justice, that's a problem. So we made was. We said that South Park is a huge problem. The simpsons is a huge problem. We went into talking about how Stephen Colbert and Jon Stewart have the right idea, but then the journal was like, oh, but they're straight white male. So you have to nuance around that to make it clear that their position is white men even though they're on the side of social justice, it's not quite good enough, you know. So they publish that. They published that, they published that. Was that. What was that one called? That one was called when the joke's on you and we made. We wrote it. They would think the joke is on us because we cited our own work in there, but the joke was actually on them for publishing it.

Speaker 1:          00:10:12       Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. It's so. It's so funny how racist you can be as long as you're racist against white people.

Speaker 2:          00:10:21       That's what we saw is that as long as you are going up the river against privileged, then you can really just get away with some.

Speaker 1:          00:10:29       And you could generalize. Oh, totally gross generalizations. It's not treat people as individuals. Absolutely. It's very strange. It's very strange that this is the left, you know, I was a kid in San Francisco in the 19 seventies. Uh, we lived in, you know, like was the hippie times and that's, I, I lived there from age seven to 11 and it kind of formed a lot of my opinions about people like that who gives a shit. Part of my, my, my appreciation for any group, whatever it is, whether it's race or gender or sexual orientation and I just, I don't understand it from either way. I certainly don't understand it from a racist perspective, but I really don't understand it from racism that's condoned because it's racism against white people. This is the left, this is the. These are, these are the people that are preaching against hate and these are the people that used to be the people that were supposedly so open minded and so open to ideas and now they're trying to stifle creativity and stifled dissent and stifle, stifle anything that doesn't fit inside that very narrow paradigm they're trying to push. It's very strange.

Speaker 2:          00:11:48       No, they co opted the civil rights movement. The good name of the civil rights movement is kind of the brand they ride on. You know, they're fighting against racism. They're fighting against sexism, misogyny, et Cetera, and the thing is, is that's not really what's going on here. They've actually tapped into this to, to throw around the term, this postmodern notion that everything in society has to do with power dynamics and the power dynamics have to be understood in terms of groups and how those groups have traditionally held power and exercise power. And so immediately it becomes stuck in this idea that it's all about this group or that group and how they relate to one another. And I don't mean like, Hey, let's get along relate. I mean like white people are imagined to always be over black people and therefore, you know, there's always as natural power dynamic of, of, of oppressor versus oppressed.

Speaker 2:          00:12:35       And this is stuff that came straight out of this weird postmodern philosophy where you said he's dissatisfied French philosophers in the sixties, you know, all one, this is, all this stuff you were talking about was going down. Um, they saw this stuff and they said, wow, you know, okay, power dynamics or the thing, because I should go back a step. The postmodern philosophers like food co and all of this got all hooked up on power because they were too satisfied with seeing what they called grand narratives. Christianity, capitalism, Marxism, they saw all these huge, you know, explanations for how the world works and said, you know, they're not working. Look how bad communism failed. Look how there's so much bullshit coming out of this or that from religion. It's not working, we need to just get rid of all of it. We're going to deconstruct this, we're going to break it down to its power dynamics, and then we're going to look at it in terms of who has master hood over over who, who's oppressing what, whereas dominance and it's just kind of grown.

Speaker 2:          00:13:32       It got picked up in the, in the academic culture in the 19 sixties. That's how old this stuff is, and then it took this huge turn in the 19 nineties and get really vicious and that's where it really got. You know, that's when it turned intersectional actually. That was during the political correct days. That's, that's when the political correct thing kind of blew up. Yes. When all this stuff was coming out, so that would have been late. Nineteen eighties is really when all of this political correctness stuff started coming out at the academy and then a few years later you see it coming all over politics, which typically what happens, it starts in the academy. A few years later it leaks into the culture and politics or media or detect sector. Now, whatever it happens to be, the stifling of creativity is the most disturbing part about it like this, the agreement that South Park and the simpsons are a real problem.

Speaker 2:          00:14:18       It's so bizarre because here's the thing, if they miss the mark and it's not funny, it won't work and then it'll be a bad show and no one would like it, but if it's funny, there has to be something about it that people find ironic, satirical. There has to be something about it that people are enjoying. It has to point to some truth and the denial of this and instead like to saying, oh, it's white males that are causing this problem and you shouldn't attack this or that, or the subjects that are off limits and social justice should never be attacked like the

Speaker 1:          00:14:52       to agree to that it. It's so. It's so preposterous. This is life. We're talking about. This is literally a nuance of life. All the various strange things in the spectrum of human behavior and and all the things that you encounter in life and to segment and limit what is and is not what's off limits. It's not off limits based on race, based on things that a person can't control at all. You're just born white, so if you're born white, you're born and oppressor, you're victimizer, and if you're a white male, you're a fucking piece of shit and you can say that white, Hetero male in particular. Oh God. I mean, I've seen so many tweets from people that mean so many virtue signaling tweets, but one of my favorite ones is this feminist who said, all white, a white straight men are trash unless proven otherwise. The thing right? All of us, all of us, 50 million of us have been give or take. You know how many gay folks there are? Trash, trash,

Speaker 2:          00:15:59       no problem. Proven. It's proven otherwise improve. You're not right. How do you do that? That's a lie. You have to be an outlaw. Know where they asked us to problematize allyship too. You see there's power dynamics. Once you say, Hey, I'm an ally, now you've made it so that you have like a shield where people can call you a white supremacist anymore and you are acting on behalf of other people in your speaking for them, so you now have assumed power that we're reproducing the same power dynamics. That was my mind comp per paper that rewrote my income was about allyship and they were like, okay,

Speaker 1:          00:16:29       you didn't prevalent allyship. Yeah, we had two of them that did mountain comp. One of them we just more or less replaced whites would replace Jews with white men and you literally took mine comp. The actual words from mind calm and put it in this paper and replaced the word Jews with the word white men and they accepted it. Well, we had two papers that did mind comprehend so that one did not get accepted with the quotes that you guys use.

Speaker 2:          00:16:57       I mean, so that one was. What we did was we took the whole document on online and we just searched the word Jew and we just started picking sentences and paragraphs. So what was it that at the end it was something like, if we don't combat whiteness, it's going to be the funeral wreath for mankind that's grayed out now. They didn't. Yeah, they didn't. They didn't accept that paper though because that paper, uh, turns out was written from the perspective of a white lesbian who hated her own whiteness. And they said that it was positioning her as a good white and because she's making herself out as a good way again, allyship isn't all it's cracked up to be. She was making a problem. She should have really been forwarding the ideas of the black scholars that she read way more and not talking about herself so much, even though it was a paper designed to be talking about yourself, which

Speaker 1:          00:17:44       what Hitler did. So that's what we had to do. Now the other mind

Speaker 2:          00:17:50       comp paper was about feminism and what we did was he took the chapter, it's chapter 12. We took the chapter where he says, this is why we should have the Nazi party and what is expected of people who are going to be part of it. And we took out our movement, our party, he didn't call it a Nazi party in the chapter, but everywhere. He's like our movement. Took that out, put in intersectional feminism, and then modified the words and added theory around it so that it would fly and theory. That's what they call it. I love that word theory. I love when feminist theory, I love when they throw that around, like, what are you saying? But you're saying things that like once you say that you're, you're good. Like you've said, you can say something ridiculous and then say feminist theory. And they're like, oh, it's in feminist theory.

Speaker 2:          00:18:32       Yeah, that's the thing, right? Is so much of the stuff they come up with. Let me throw him an olive branch, like so much of the stuff, they come up with a creative idea. Maybe there's something to some of this stuff, right? But what they're putting forward as hypotheses and then they're treating them as conclusions so they're putting forward this idea. I saw one on twitter today. It was something like there's about South Park, how it's been laundering racism into society and making everybody comfortable with racism and that's why everything is so racist and people are shooting Jews is because south park made it normal that they're treating that as a conclusion, but that's a hypothesis, right? So we could test that. It's conceivable that you could actually try to parse out what variables need to be controlled. See, you know, South Park came out and started doing these themes.

Speaker 2:          00:19:12       What, how does it track? Statisticians can do kind of amazing things with that stuff, but they're not doing that. They're not testing it and testing it. They're concluding it and they're using theory to do so and they're going, no, no, no. It's even bigger than that because why don't they test it? Well, if they tested it, and this is, I'm not making this shit up, you won't believe me, but this is true. If they tested it in the test showed that their hypothesis was wrong, they would say that the test was racist, but the test is condoning racism and that's why it didn't give them the desired result. How would you test something, because I mean, I'm not a statistician, I actually am a mathematician, but I'm not a statistician. They're two different things, so I'm not exactly sure how you would test that, but conceivably you could gather data, survey data and see how attitudes have changed.

Speaker 2:          00:19:54       Maybe you could track those kinds of articles, kinds of events that are coming out. You could kind of pair that up with what's been shown on south park who aren't self park and track that with attitudes. There's no effort to do this. They're like, oh, South Park presents these ideas, which they then cherry pick because there's other ideas that they don't talk about their point the other direction. These ideas are problematic. That's the big word. Theoretically that's a problem. Why? Because they, and I'm not joking, they literally believed that use of language creates the power dynamics that defined society. So South Park's using language and imagery that creates a power dynamic that makes people more comfortable being racist. Boom. Theory done tests needed. No even attempt test. Then if the test happened, the test itself would be racist unless it confirmed the hypothesis. Right, so they start with an agenda and then you mentioned the word laundry, which could your former guests, heather, talked about a ideal laundry.

Speaker 2:          00:20:50       I think that's important to the listeners. So what's really what's going on here is, um, they're forwarding these hypotheses. They treat, they don't treat them as hypotheses and then they write up a paper paper, like we were saying is the absolute gold standard of academic work. They send the paper off. The reviewers in our cases, made our papers crazier every single time. So they push it further into the ideology or the madness. How does the review or do something like that? What, what input did they get to have? They said, for example, that we should problematize allyship if we're gonna, if we want our paper published, we've got to problematize ally Shit. I love that word. Problematize everything. Everything. Problematize everything. Dog Parks problem. The problem with literally anything can be problematized and looked at through a feminist lens. Does everything. Every tool. That's why we called it grievance studies.

Speaker 2:          00:21:39       The grievance is they're massively. Okay. So then, but the do the Homo transphobia trans paper. So we wrote this paper saying that straight men are generally transphobic, meaning in particular the kind of niche weird definition that you see on the Internet and activist sometimes that they aren't interested in having sex with trans people who have penises, trans women who have a penis in particular. And so we said, well that's the kind of transphobia. And clearly the reason that they might be transphobic is because they don't practice putting things on their butts. So if they start putting stuff up their butts in particular, we call it the paper dildos. So you can imagine what we were saying that she put up the paper was called Dildo. No, that was the, that was the nickname we gave it. The paper was called going into the back door.

Speaker 2:          00:22:24       Really, really go, going in through the back door. There's a lot of technical words that one get published published. So we argued that, that uh, if straight men just penetrated themselves and had their girlfriends pegged them through exposure therapy, you know, you start small and then work your way up. You can remediate transphobia. Yeah. Will make them less transphobic. So as a self penetrating or having your girlfriend peg you, you can be less transphobic and they thought this is great. So we base this off of off of eight interviews. It really 13 interviews, but with men and I say really a 13. There were 13 interviews documented, but five of them were gay people, not even straight people, so they don't really apply. So then we have these eight interviews with straight men. We made. One of them are conservative and he's just so we could just put in like, you know, crazy things that a conservative might say about this. And they were like, why don't, why weren't there more conservatives participating? So I was like, well I'm going to run with this. I wrote this whole thing. We invited six conservatives to participate and only one accepted. And to kind of summarize why in the world, and this is in the paper, in the words of one, I don't want to be a part of some stupid liberal study about shoving things up your butt. And they published that in. Oh my God. So we wrote this

Speaker 1:          00:23:46       retracted article going in through the back door right there. Oh my God. Now did they contact you after they were tracked your article and they go, Hey, you guys are fucking assholes. You're wasting our time. We spent hours reviewing your papers. We got a couple of pretty bitter responses. But mostly no. Mostly they've kind of put their head in the sand and kind of avoided talking to us that what I was saying before the show started that I read one article that was really diminishing the impact of what you guys have done. Saying like what? It's not a big deal. They were trying to make it seem as if what you guys had written was just a prank. That's not what. That's absolutely false. Yeah. There's a lot of papers that seemed like parody that make it through that you guys aren't writing. Oh yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:24:34       We could pull up one about how hot wings and like there's a TV show, spicy ones or something like that. About hot wings. Oh yeah, yeah. The Youtube show. Yeah. So they had a whole one's hot one's. That's what it was. They had a whole, uh, there is a paper out there about that show and it's all about how, you know, hot sauce has everything to do with masculinity and being manly and they didn't have enough women on the show because it's sexist in the hot hot sauce, I think was a sexist part and it has all these bizarre concluded. We cited that in the paper we wrote about hooters. We're putting in the part that masculinity contests of eating the hot wings who can eat more hot wings and then they say, Oh, I ate 20 hot wings. Ask out the hooters girl and eating show hot ones is problematic.

Speaker 1:          00:25:16       Problematic. There's an ally, but that's a real paper, right? So we cited that paper. It's real. There are thousands of papers like this spectacular food, gender and celebrity on hot ones. And so as a professor, he probably teaches this stuff to students, right? So now everything's problematized and this is what credentials him. You get seven in general, you get the says it's a woman. Years ago she wrote it, but who's the other one? Tisha, at the end who wrote that introduction. Oh, what's the difference? There's two people there. Oh, it's a commentary. Is it? Is it an article about the article? Yeah, that's probably what's going on. His commentary and criticism. Yeah. This is. It looks like. I mean, I haven't read this specifically, but wait a minute, listen to the first statement. Food media have been recognized as cultural artifacts that referenced culturally and historically specific ideals of gender, drawing on the simultaneously mundane and omd food as a medium for interrogating, interrogating ideas about feminism and identity performance.

Speaker 1:          00:26:24       What I was telling you, shut the fuck man. This is like everything we talked about. This is such unbelievable horseshit. No, this person is teaching at Central Michigan University. Yeah. Yeah. This is for real. This is real, and so there is now a, an ever expanding group of these folks. They teach. Do you want to read more of it as we didn't find this and criticism section, the author's introduced a diverse sample of case studies that demonstrate the emergence of feminist ideas in and through food media. Oh yeah man. Fuck. Are you worried about that? Getting a job, a real job, go out there and work, do something that someone wants to pay for something of value, engagement with hot sauce. It was so crazy and this is what they're teaching our kids. Racial assumptions inherent to post feminist food culture. Oh yeah. I was going to write a paper about how cornbread is being gentrified and that's why I will never get over racism because white people are making like pumpkin spice cornbread.

Speaker 1:          00:27:30       Just something that I tweeted the other day about some what Gad sad tweeted it and I retweeted it about some. Some woman was taking back bone broth. I saw that. Yeah, it's good. What in the fuck are you talking about? People cooking bone broth? Thousands and thousands of years getting nutrients from the food. You problematized it. Look at this. Queer woman of color wants to decolonize bone broth. Stop appropriating my culture. Gad said he's awesome. That is so fucking preposterous. A queer woman of color. So what I'm saying man, there's a thousand papers like this out there for everyone. We wrote a thousand of them that you might as well written. Well, you couldn't tell if we did or didn't. That's part of things. People can't differentiate what we've done. In fact, not only can they not differentiated, they give us an award so they can't differentiate it from the stuff that's already out there and there's stuff that's already out there as polluting people's minds. You guys, you guys, at least you used to work in academia, you work in academia. What is, how, how were your peers treating this?

Speaker 2:          00:28:41       There are. Well, Pete has, is going to have a lot to say about that I think, but for me, I've had two from academic people. I've had two kinds of responses, but the overwhelming uh, but some of those are like, ah, you guys. And then the overwhelming of them are the same thing over and over and over again. And I mean a lot of people. Thank you so much for doing this, but I can't, don't tell anybody. I'm just trying to get a job. I'm up for tenure. I can't talk about. Thank you. This needs to go and that's everywhere. It's everywhere. You can't proceed through academia now unless you bow to this stuff. Ten years sounds like tyranny. It did. The whole thing sounds preposterous. That you can keep a job for life. Well, the idea was supposed to be that you work your ass off for a few years and then you. It was supposed to be to defend academic freedom so you get tenure, then you can go forth and put out some crazy ideas, really like dig into some stuff and they can't fire you for coming up with weird stuff and then people would argue about it. But now it's kind of become the situation where people get into this, they get in their job, then you can't get rid of them.

Speaker 3:          00:29:42       Right, right, right. What is there a way to fire people? Well, if they do something like sexual harassment and usually you can find a way around the tenure thing. So what is it like for you now? You are actually super uncomfortable or people upset at you? I'd say they were enraged. You know what I mean? The only, the only thing I can think of, it's like if you taught at a Christian school and then you went in and took videos and posting them on youtube of suffocating the Bible and then just walked into the school. So I think it's kind of similar in that they, they have bought hook, line and sinker into microaggressions, trigger warning, safe spaces, diversity and issues there. There are no, there's no questioning. There's a. and it's something for me that makes me deeply uncomfortable when my students can ask questions when, when they, they can't. They're just uncomfortable to voice their opinions about things and I think that that peep to say the least. A lot of people are enraged at me, but exactly what Jim said. Some people will come in like, oh, thank you so much. Like I know, but again, I can't be public about what is the ratio.

Speaker 2:          00:30:55       I mean for me it's like 95 percent people who are really happy it happened and can't let it be known, but I'm not, you know, facing these people

Speaker 3:          00:31:05       full everyday. Well, you know, through the videos from evergreen state, you can see Bret Weinstein's interactions with not just students, but also some of the professors that were there, there were some of these preposterous people that he had to work with that are buying in Hook, line and sinker to this stuff and they live in these insulated world and they just, they, they create these people that also want to stay inside these insulated worlds and then it just sort of stew in these ideas and then again go out into the real world and they think they're better people as a result. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:31:41       So that's a big trick to doing the good work because to like question this, maybe to look at it and say, ah, you know, that kind of looks like bullshit, but I don't know. A lot of these guys are left leaning. People are outright leftists. A lot of them want to do the right thing, right? They really do. These people really care about progressive agendas, you know, getting over any lingering discrimination that's going on, racism, sexism, et Cetera. They really want to do the right thing. Good for them. Right. That's what we want, but they actually have to question or like run county, you think of that like as a river of morality, running through them to their mind they actually have to go upstream a little bit and that's hard and it feels weird. You have to say, wait a minute, maybe this scholarship, maybe this stuff isn't the best way to do it, but then the first thought you have as well, these guys are these people in these disciplines. Grievance studies are are fighting racism, so if I go against them then I'm going against the people fighting racism, so maybe I'm helping racism and what we keep. If we get any criticism, that's what it always is.

Speaker 3:          00:32:41       Being racists, you're a tool of the right, etc. Etc. Etc. You're racist or we are outright racists. Outright racist and accusEd of being. Alright. If you disagree with any of this stuff, I get accused of being outright all the time. I lean so far left universal healthcare, universal, basic income, free school, I think. I think education should be free. I think we should paY for, I believe in a lot of socialist ideas. Totally, but I'm right wing because I make fun of people that want to study problemization of dogs. Fucking really worried. That's where it is. If you look at like whether I support gay rights, women's rights, I'm all, I'm all right. I'm on board with all that shit. Take more of my taxes. I can, I can. I can afford to pay more if I really believed that people are going to get real healthcare and real education. Fucking very happy. Very happy. Yup. if I thought it was all being appropriated and used correctly. Fuck yeah. Let's, let's make the world a better place.

Speaker 2:          00:33:44       So that's the thing, right, is if all this scholarship that they were doing on race and gender, although that's important stuff, right? So if they're doing that right, why wouldn't you want to be behind it? But they're not doing it right. HOw do I know? Because I made up papers about dog humping and made up the conclusion before I wrote the paper and then boom, they publish it and given an award. If I can start with the conclusion and then work backwards to that conclusion, then I'm not doing rigorous scholarship. I'm making shit up.

Speaker 3:          00:34:10       Well also there's no room for dissent and there's absolutely zero and in academia you can't even. You have to teach whatever the moral orthodoxy is. So just imagine this going into university. You're trying to your young mind, you're young kid and I'm deeply concerned about these kids are going and they never hear the other side of an issue about immigration. They never hear the other day so that they become brittle over time. So when they hear it, they just, they don't know what to do. They're shocked by it. Professors are terrified that they'll get a complaint. They'll hAve to go to the diversity board. I've been told that I'm not allowed to render my opinion about protected classes when I had that ethics and I teach ethics. I don't teach a class or two classes. I've also. That's a great question. Thank you for asking me.

Speaker 3:          00:34:54       I've asked for a definition of protected classes, a list of protected classes. I didn't receive any. Uh, you can be criticized for. I cannot, I cannot offer for it. yeah. Yeah. I cannot offer under. Oh no, no, no, no, no. So yeah, it was up on a title nine violation. I'm not, I'm up for a violation of title nine violation. That title nine title nine violation is serious shit. I. Federal discrimination law in universities. Yeah. What'd you do? I can't talk about it. It's okay. But, but among the other things that came out in that meeting where, uh, I'm not allowed to render my opinion about a protective class. And so for example, uh, I can't, so I know are covered under a protective classes. you can't have an opinion on homosexual people. I can have an opinion, but I can't. What if it's a positive opinion?

Speaker 3:          00:35:45       Well, so the example that was used in class was evident. Evidently I made a comment. Okay. So let's take a step back. Okay. So this is an ethics class and I was talking about how a sexual choice does not fall into the realm of morality. So if, If a guy's gay and he likes another guy, that's just not a moral thing. That's just preference or just is what it is, like a matter of taste and some, I don't remember the whole thing, but someone in someone in the class said, well, you know, you shouldn't have tastes or something or you shouldn't have, and I can't remember the exact frame because I'm getting this third hand from the, from my violation. You know, my time came to someone else. Somebody said in class, well what about this? And I, I made the comment, I said, everybody has something.

Speaker 3:          00:36:37       Everybody has a preference. Like you can't say that no one had a preference. I said, again, it would be as if it was, it would be as if I said, well, you know, I don't want to date someone who's 400 pounds. So that comment then got turned into something when they called somebody else in the office of diversity inclusion called someone else in and it was made that I was rendering my opinion about people who were 400 pounds when my. What I was doing is saying that homosexuality itself, there's no, there's no reason to give that. It's just not a moral thing, but people lump it in, but the main point of this whole thing is that we have situations in which professors can't talk about protected classes. Students are afraid to ask questions. Everybody's walking on egg shells and the students aren't learning and phrases are taken out of context.

Speaker 3:          00:37:25       Phrases are taking out of context now. Now if you want a place to go to celebrate whatever the raining, more orthodoxy is in the university is a great place for you. Did you explain what you meant by saying that? You like saying you don't want to date people over 400 pounds. Did you explain the context of the use of. She wasn't interested in the context of it and the trend. He didn't even say he doesn't want to date people over 400 pounds. He said it as exactly as I phrase it as a hypothetical. Right, so their entire thing, and if you had said maybe I don't like, I don't want to date people over seven feet tall. Maybe you could have got away with that. Yeah. I don't think people over seven feet tall or protected class, you could have got away with that even though it's still basically the same thing.

Speaker 3:          00:38:09       It's a preference issue. So I mentioned this to one of my colleagues and he said to me, oh you, that's. You can't say that. You should never have said that. And I said, really? Why? He said, well, you should have said, well, we'll, I don't like dating blue or green people. I'm like, why? They're they know that they, they don't even know blue green people who is coming to around man and then they become a protected class. Then someone goes back and looks at what you said 10 years ago about blue or green. So that's how I get fired and that's how that works.

Speaker 2:          00:38:36       So if you look at all this stuff then coming out about victimhood culture and how it propagates and how it develops, and that's one of the things. It's called competitive victimhood. You could call it additive competitive. That's the formal term.

Speaker 3:          00:38:48       People who study this love that wonderful people are fighting over who's a bigger victim.

Speaker 2:          00:38:55       Did you see it all the time? It's like you see people in society, It's like, oh, the black lives matter. People go nuts and then all of a sudden the white supremacists are out and they're like, oh, white people have it hard too. The second day, the second somebody hears, oh, black people have a hard somebodIes got to be like white people have it hard too. That's competitive victimhood and so then when you have like a moral economy, if you will, where you can kind of cash in, gain status or gain access to to speaking or whatever it happens to be by holding a certain status of victim hood or grievance. Then you're gonna. Find people competing to find ways to get that for themselves. Everybody's going to go. I mean you have the infrastructure there. Everybody's goIng to go after trying to maximize their own utility within that, so people over seven feet tall aren't a protected class yet, but the second they realize that they might be able to cash in on it. They might lobby for it. Edited victimhood, grievance jockeying. It's been also, I've called it grievance jockeying, I think gets out since you mentioned him, called it the oppression olympics. Yep, yup.

Speaker 3:          00:39:51       Yeah. It's wonderful times, but it really is. If you look at the root, so here's the thing that we thought about extensively. If you look at the root, where is this stuff coming from? All of this stuff is coming from these, the canons of knowledge, their bodies of literature, they're peer reviewed and that's the idea laundering thing. yeah. Which was. So all of that stuff is coming from from this and if you want to make. If you want to get back to constructive politics to get back to people having conversations and that's a thing like that's. I think one of the reasons that your show has been so successful is it's a, It's a combination of authenticity with you can have your totally willing to have conversations with no holds barred, right? You can't have that in the academy, so people need to go to you to hear these thoughts and to wrestle with ideas and to engage.

Speaker 3:          00:40:46       It's just if you can, you can't really do it anywhere else other than a podcast or you can't do it in the academy, but you can't even do it on the today show. They fired meghan carroll for asking why is blackface racist, which is a stupid fucking question. No doubt, and she's not a bright woman and in that regard, socially very clumsy, clunky thing to say, but they just fire a fire. IT should have what they should have done was brought in black scholars and black intellectuals for a week just to fucking griller. Exactly, and that would have been amazing television, but that attItude that you have is not what they have. So they want to punish the transgression right. Today. Well, I think they just want to stop and

Speaker 1:          00:41:34       I think they didn't like her anyway,

Speaker 2:          00:41:35       that's the word is they really didn't enjoy her and that she wasn't a nice person and she was immediate. It was a learning moment, right? It was a teaching moment that's lost now. Yes, yes, yes. but think about it in terms of what we were talking about earlier where the. The scholarships stretching back again to the sixties, you have this idea that all of socIety is constructed out of power dynamics that are mediated through language media imagery and so she just now became problematic and she put out ideas that would be dangerous and poisonous not to discuss the merits or demerits of not something to work through. Not something as a teachable moment. She put out an idea that's dangerous. She can't put out ideas anymore. Well, you know, it was really interesting too. She tried. She was so disingenuous and how she approached it is so obvious. You know, what a black person is it? Why is it wrong for a black person dressed as a white person?

Speaker 1:          00:42:25       It's not. No one ever said that. Why are you pretending you're just setting it up so that you could say a white

Speaker 2:          00:42:31       pursing were black, black face about the other cultural moment there too. So like you said, they bring in black scholars and at the end of that she said, you know, I really listened to that and I didn't know that and I was wrong and I'm changing my mind. There was a woman on twitter that said her video, look, I retweeted it, that it looked like a hostage video. Anything that was missing was her holding up a newspaper that showed the day, saw that it was australian woman, go.

Speaker 1:          00:42:59       The whole thing is so fucking funny, but that is one of the worst ways to really dissect the ideas because first of all, there's the studio audience that fucks everything up. Second of all, you have these massive time constraints and then you have advertisers. Then you have a bunch of executives that are all cowards. They're all just ready to pull the trigger on anything. Anytime they can blame you for anything that went wrong and get rid of you or fire you, fire, fire him, get rid of them, get out of him, bringing the next person you know, and then they'll, they'll most likely do is to to show they've learned. They'll hire an all black crew, right? For the diverse crew. That's all a matter of fact. I think I've read it. Are they doing that? See, see if they do that. They're replacing meghan kelly with a

Speaker 2:          00:43:49       approve of color. Make about where that works, right? It works. You said they're cowards. They're afraid they're going to damage their brand or whatever it is. Where does that work or who works on that? Bullies, right, so these people, why are they so pervasive in the academy? Why are they say pr, so pervasive and media. They know they can bully these people. They know that they can go lean on this stuff and somebody is going to be cowardly and then they're going to be able to make something change in the direction they want it to change. You see, even creeping into politics, they, they try to do it with policymakers. You see it a lot more and a lot of other countries. Right now we're in this massive backlash against it in american politics. How's that going to the 2016? Your progressive agenda gang. Holy crap.

Speaker 4:          00:44:34       Well, that is a part of the problem with the. What are they saying? So yeah, look at this today. As you know, we're starting a new chapter in the third hour of our show. As it evolves, it's evolving. It's a fucking living being. We want you to know the entire today family will continue to bring you in formative and important stories just as we always have and look to black guys and a brown chick

Speaker 2:          00:44:58       that's 100 percent diverse. We got rid of the princess. All diverse. That's the thing. The way that diversity is defined. If you had a panel, it was just black guys. It would be 100 percent diverse.

Speaker 4:          00:45:10       Yeah. So they've redefined the word diversity. They need to find the word inclusion. So, but to people outside the academy, they, they think, oh, diversity, it's a great thing. Right? But that's not what it means. It means kind of when everybody has the same ideas about something and it's also when you, if you're enforcing diversity for what we have to, we would have to find out. Like ultimately the goal is to find out what, what causes people to succeed and especially succeeding in something as benign as talking. Right? You're just talking. That's all you're doing. So what causes someone to succeed and talking. What makes their ideas valuable would make some someone you'd enjoy listening to and then finding like what? What impediments? There are two that in all the various communities and fix it at the root level. What doesn't work is saying, we need one chinese lady, we need one black guy and we need one white guy. Because if you do something like that, you're not going to get the best show. Nope, you're not going to get the best.

Speaker 2:          00:46:15       Well, you're not even guaranteed to achieve the goal you're claiming. So it's, again, it goes back to theory in theory and theory in terms of postmodern critical theory that this stuff's all based on that we studied. The idea is that if you have a particular identity now you have a particular view of the world and people have other identities have different ones and in fact there's this whole thing called standpoint epistemology that says that if you have a marginalized identity, you know more about the world and other people because you live in two worlds at once. So the the idea is, oh, if we get a black guy in here, he's had a different life experience, therefore he can speak truly to that. If you get a chinese lady in here, she can speak to that. So on and so Forth. So the guests is that by virtue merely of bringing in people who look different with different races or genders or sexist or sexualities, then you automatically get a diverse set of opinions, but that doesn't work. That's not how that actually works. You could take people of every race, educate them on the exact same social justice curriculum and they all think exactly the same thing,

Speaker 4:          00:47:18       but at least in something like hosting the today show you are just talking once you put these sort of diversity standards or something like mathematics. No. yeah, that's. That's when things get super. And so

Speaker 2:          00:47:30       they're trying to do that a little bit tweeted that thing. I wroTe about the mathematics and they wanted people to sign an equity, which is another word that they've cooperated. They wanted folks to sign an equity statement and a diversity statement, and the thing is, explain, explain what they're trying to. That you, you, you have a commitment to diversity. Yeah. You have a commItment to diversity and you have a commitment to equity. And so equity does not mean treating people equally. It's not like you have a commitment to equality, which is what we should all have a short material quality. Uh, it's equity is defined differently. It's to make up for past injustices are to make up for some deficiency that has occurred somewhere along the line. So yeah, affirmative action is an equity movement. It's to treat people differently in order to level the playing field.

Speaker 2:          00:48:20       Yeah. So it's not treating people, it's not treating people equally. And that's the key thing. It sounds like it is, but it's not. It's a word that they've smuggled in straight out of the literature. Again, it's again, out of all the stuff comes back to the literature. So if you look at the word equity in the dictionary, you get one definition. But if you look at the word equIty as they're applying it and sociological definitions, it's a very specific thing that means something slightly different from what people assume. So here's the question. You should ask somebody. Anytime you hear someone use the word equity, just ask. Oh, I'm. I'm curious, why didn't you use the word equality? Can, can you. Can you think of it? Would the sentence be the same with the meeting? Be the same? Well, the meaning is not the same. That's why they used equity and not equality.

Speaker 2:          00:49:03       Equity is a finance word. That's why it's weird. He's also fun. So they don't make up new words, right? They go, yeah, they call up, they change and then they smuggled diversity inclusion, these academic papers and they come up with these ideas. They start with their conclusion, they push it through, it gets published and that's just like. It's like the academic equivalent of money laundering. Money laundering work. Yes. You take some money, you got, you know, ill gotten money, you put it through this shell company or this thing or the other thing and it comes back to you. And now it's had illegal trail that makes it legit. Right? Well here you take some prejudice. You write it down as an academic paper. You published the thing, it gets the academic standard stamp on it. It's the gold standard of knowledge now and now. This is this prejudice you started with now looks like legitimate knowledge that can go straight in the classroom.

Speaker 2:          00:49:52       It can go straight to exactly. Activists or policymakers. It's a real problem. Yeah. And then really funny though that you get it is that's bret weinstein said that weinstein said that and that's what it comes out. The other side is knowledge. So then they think they have knowledge or paper about the dildos. The guy said this paper is an important contribution to knowledge. Who is it that the reviewer one? I think out of the viewer, what? Who the fuck are you Important contribution to knowledge. I would hope reviewer one was just hitting a bong right

Speaker 1:          00:50:28       before big data was laughing, laughing at the whole college. What kind of person gets attracted to whole heartedly agreeing to these ridiculous ideas? Like what? What are the people like to gray question. I think it's people who want to save the world. Well, we, I think we would all like to save the world.

Speaker 2:          00:50:48       Yeah. I'm much more cynical than they. Yeah, they've got to know they've got, they've got this idea that, I mean we talked a moment ago about about privilege and we kind of brushed real close to the idea that it fits kind of like original sin. And so they see that the downside of privilege, the opposIte side, discrimination or racism, sexism, et cetera. Hate is the big word. You know, fight hate or he's he, he's using hate. This is hate speech. That's where I think they got the term that's like the evil thing. You're born with privilege. That's like original sin. So what do they want to do? They want, they want to fIx the save the world by clearing out the evil of privilege, by clearing out hate from the world. For them. Utopia means nobody hates. And by hate we mean something like racism, sexism, etc.

Speaker 2:          00:51:38       So it's a noble idea, but then when you start looking at it and it's ridiculous way, like you're born with privilege and now you're just stuck with it, right? What can you do? It's original sin. You can be sorry for it. You can try to be an ally and work it off. You can check it. Whatever the hell that means. You can do a lot of things, but you can't actually atone for it. You can't get over it. You can't get rid of it. Then you get this situation where it's like they really, really need to take desperate measures. Like, let's lock it all down. Let's, let's tell these people that they're wrong. Let's try to point out how white supremacy is in them because they're white. LeT's point out how masculinity is an ideology that needs to be destroyed. That was Lisa Wade. She wrote that last year.

Speaker 1:          00:52:18       That is an ideology that needs to be destroyed.

Speaker 2:          00:52:23       Yeah. It needs to be masculine because trump, and this is the thing, right? I think in the past couple of years, of course, before trump, it wasn't new. They had other avatars. I think there's a lot of anger and frustration, justifiably slow at trump and they see this and so I read so many other, usually op-eds, not their academic pieces and it's like men are like this, men are blah, blah, blah, and you can tell they're just talking about trump, but they can't touch him. So they're pissed off and they tried to take it out on all men. I think that's like a huge thing. They see these problems, they exaggerate the problems. They practIce problematizing and that's a thing, rIght? They practice this stuff. You go to school, it's in the general ed curriculum. Maybe they major in this stuff. You get good at fInding problems. I was just talking yesterday.

Speaker 2:          00:53:03       came over. I never actually, I got to los angeles a couple of times before, but I've never been to the beach. I never actually made it down, so I went down to santa monica, go to one of these burger places right on the, on the right by the pier and it says that this is the burger that made santa monica famous and immediately you saw the hot ones thing. right? I was like, there's a paper on this, you see the problems here. You have this manly double being marketed. That's what made santa monica famous. Oh, so maInly food culture is the kind of like colonialism that goes and makes a city become a city. It makes a place into a place. And you could. I could write a paper about that in three days. Do you have to have credentials to write a paper, a phd?

Speaker 2:          00:53:42       No, technically not. And that's a sad thing because what their response to this has been, oh, we're going to screen better to see who is actually writing these papers so they can't trick us, but that's bullshit. So we trick you. The point is that the scholarship is that it should stand on its merits of the arguments solid if the research is good and they thought our research was good. So my point about the dog humping thing, it should leave it the way it is. If they're saying that this is such an important piece. Right. Well, I mean I would walk back on that one because we did make up the data and falsifying data is not cool. Well, what data would be incorrect? Like what? We didn't even go to the dog park. We definitely didn't ask anybody about their dogs or their genitals or anything that you could have similar results.

Speaker 2:          00:54:27       We said that there's a dog crapping on another dog's head in the paper and like that didn't happen. I'm sure that didn't happen and maybe it did happen though. I mean this is insane, but we had other papers that didn't do that. Fat bodybuilding didn't do that. The one that's the one that joke's on. You didn't do that. There was no made up data and most of our papers. And why shouldn't those stand? Right. Why should they stand by those? Exactly. I can get it because we can't differentiate real scholarship from bullshit because they're in this crazy eco system in which their ability to make discerning judgments about things has been dulled because they put an agenda before the truth. I keep seeing all these academics coming like they get their got you moment on us. They're like, oh, I read your paper. It's actually a real paper.

Speaker 2:          00:55:07       It's good. Yeah. How crazy is like, yeah, thanks For noticing. You know, asshole. That's exactly what we were trying to do. We weren't writing just stupid pranks. The dog park papers pretty funny, but we were actually trying to learn what's going on there. Thanks for noticing somebody finally did, but that means of course they don't want to admit that we actually learn this stuff because then when we say it's shit, they're stuck with somebody who knows what they're talking about saying it sucks and they don't want that either. No. When you said these people that are trying to save the world, like what? What do you really mean by that? I think there are the people who are trying to build the kingdom of god on the planet earth. You know, to draw a metaphor, religious metaphor. There are people who see an eVil and they want to purge the world of that evil by any means necessary, and the evil being like privilege, privilege, privilege and white supremacy, new religions, patriarch. Christianity goes down. It's just a game of thrones is the onlY reason you need new gods are because people don't believe in the old gods and so we have these religious modules or what have you in our brain and the new religion is intersectionality and we see really is what it is exactly what it is. You know the parallels are wrIting about that and talking about that for years studyIng religion psychology for years and it's. It's all over the listening is political correctness

Speaker 3:          00:56:24       is paralleled with blast. For me, it's the same parallels of harrison the apparels. That's exactly right. I mean it's, it's so stunning how easily people sort of slide into these preconditioned slots. Huge. The one difference, and I think this is a key difference, the reason that it's easier, and I mentioned this to pendulum when we did a talk and he just couldn't believe it. The reason that it's easier to talk to christian for example, about faith or about their religion is because at the end of the day it comes down to faith. These people don't have any faith. They have knowledge, quote unquote. They have their bodies of scholarly literature which are ideal honored. That's what they have, so they can point to these things and say, well, I don't have any. I know. I know. How do you know? Well, robin deangelo's, white fragility. How'd you study? There's a study. Yeah, there's a study. There's a study, there's a study. I know household stuff. Some of those studies are written and trust them and you shouldn't trust them either. Yeah. Well you see that even in nutrition when you see it in everything this, this in in terms of like almost a religious or religion, like accepting. Exactly. Have specific ways of eating or specific ways of communicating, specific ways of being. It's just so strange how people seem to have this natural inclination to adopt predetermined patterns of behavior. Right?

Speaker 2:          00:57:49       Yeah. I think actually there's pretty decent understanding of that from from the perspective of moral psychology. You've got this idea that somebody has has seen something as good so it elevates them. It makes them better, so clean eating might be good, right? Whatever clean eating means. For some people it's vegan. For some people it's like all you eat is grass fed beef, who knows, but you've got clean eating and you've got dirty eating and he'd go into the clean thing and so you've got this kind of like purity thing and eventually you take this so seriously that it becomes kind of a sacred value to you. Well, what's sacred mean? You know, we have this kind oF vague sense, oh, you know, holy this, that, that's sacred and it's something really important to somebody. Or what it really means is that it's taken on so much moral important to somebody that they no longer will allow it to be questioned when something sacred.

Speaker 2:          00:58:33       It's now been removed from the sphere of being doubted, questioned or whatever. And so when you have this idea of Like that, um, let's say that that privilege is the cause of, of racism, and you've elevated that are the problem with everything in society, even then you've elevated that to a sacred value that can't be questioned. You can't say maybe there's another dimension to it. That's when you start getting these kinds of religious like behaviors. You start getting these, these problems because you've got a place where it can't be a question. Be made fun of. If we're talking about the comedy earlier, this is killing comedy, right? It's absolutely killing comedy because you can't make a joke because if the joke goes a little bit wrong, now you're. You've committed a heresy, you're a blasphemer, they're going to be yes,

Speaker 3:          00:59:17       but no, because people love when you go against it. That's

Speaker 1:          00:59:22       true. So the weight of it is there, but when you resist it, people scream and throw. YeS, yes, yes. So this is really interesting because if we take their theory about humor at face value, right? That you can only go against a power thing. So we say, okay, you know what? We wrote a paper, one of our papers, the joke's on you was about that. Let's say the right. Why do people love it? Well, it's because everybody knows these guys, these guys have power. They're trying to pretend that they don't have power, that they are the victims. They're the oppressed. Meanwhile, they're bullying everybody and everything. They're firing people for saying the wrong thing in class. You know, whatever it is, that's only possible if they have power in the joke when south park makes fun of like, what was it, pc, principal or whatever.

Speaker 1:          01:00:01       When south park makes fun of that. The only reason people laugh if their theory is right is because they're powerful. If their theory's wrong because it's just funny. Then we can talk about something different, but if they're actually right, if they're actually making a point here, they're not recognizing that they're admitting that they have seized a lot of cultural power and that's why people celebrate when you go back against stuff. That's why people have sent us some emails, like this is the greatest thing ever. Thank you so much for doing this. There's all this shit like you guys are heroes, blah, blah blah. Why? Because they wanted to see you laughed. Why? Because it was funny. As hell as why and why? Because these people are there. They're influencing the shit out of stuff. Yeah, and if they weren't, if they were just, you know, victims who don't have a voice, who can't make any impact, who aren't bullying people.

Speaker 1:          01:00:47       Every room you're like, why are you bullying those guys? Why are you being a dick? Right, but everybody thinks it's funny and why? Because because they have real impact. They haven't had a real impact. Yeah, and that's one of the things that we really want to convey to people is that this happens in the academy, does not stay in the academy. No, it's spread. It's spread throughout the world now and I've, I've read some articles about some things that we've said on this show that are just fucking completely preposterous and taken totally out of context and presented as some evidence of, you know, whatever transgression that's impossible to defend. It's very strange. It's very strange time for, for communication. It's a very strange time for ideas now, but I also think it's really exciting. It's exciting that all this nonsense is going on. That's one of the things that are really loved about what you guys have done.

Speaker 1:          01:01:35       It's exciting. It's exciting that you guys have infiltrated and had these fucking dummies public. Not just publish your shit, but praise it. Yeah. I'd say how amazing it is that you wrote a bit about fat bodybuilding acceptance is this one fat shaming and fat acceptance too. Preposterous phrases. There really are. You know, I mean you shouldn't be mean to people. That's it, but fat shaming because someone's fat. No, you can't call me fat because I'm not. Fat doesn't work. So that's real similar. So that body of literature. Here's something that I learned when I. I read this is they don't use the word obesity because this is really interesting because obesity, it gets back to what jim was saying. Obesity is a narrative. It's just a story. So they use the word fat. Excuse me. So there's not obesity, bodybuilding, there's fat bodybuilding and there are all these narratives, so why would one want to buy into one narrative rather than another narrative?

Speaker 1:          01:02:41       Why iS fat and obesity? Because obesity is a medicalized narrative where fat is just a description. They're rejecting medicalized terms. Well, they call it a health system. I'm not making that up. Health is a narrative. It's a power structure were healthy and thin. People are imposing their view of how bodies should be on an unhealthy, been privileged, like they'd look at you and you've got all the [inaudible] your muscular too, so you wouldn't just be straight white, heterosexual, cis, etc. I mean you've got health privilege and you've got health privilege and privilege. Probably thin privilege also enable us. You're really, you're really stuck. Good for you. Falls into that. So I'm privileged. That's real. That's a real one that they use and they also claim to be a healthy at every size movement. You can be healthy at every size and obesity is just a medicalized narratives. Yeah, and that's really important though because the point of that is to say if your doctor tells you you're fat and it's a health concern, then you don't have to listen. Yeah, that is the. I've read that before and they're read an article by this woman who was morbidly obese. Charlotte cooper. I don't use the mail order,

Speaker 4:          01:03:56       but she was talking. She was also using really misusing some studies on. There was some there. There. There have been some studies on people who are overweight and that there could possibly be some health benefits to being overweight. These studies had been widely dismissed. Now not only dismissed, but they go in direct contrast to the great volume of studies that show how terrible it is for your health to be that, that fat and that heavy, but this person, I don't remember who it was, why she was doing this, but she was clinging to these one or two studies that have been dismissed. These are biased epidemiological studies that have been dismissed, but she was put putting them in this blog as if this is some sort of evidence that not only is it not unhealthy to be fat, but it might be healthy to be fast and I'll think about this person in an academic position as a professor teaching young people to protect particularly young girls, particularly young girls who have eating disorders. Exactly. Health a white privilege.

Speaker 1:          01:05:07       Oh my god, is this real? This is a real paper is definitely. Oh man, they think it's a. I think it's like when the doctor says you're overweight, it's a concern for your health. See that as a form

Speaker 2:          01:05:18       of fat shaming saying that they're not all right the way that they are. They're not Being accepted the way that they are. There was a power dynamic that healthy people are imposing upon overweight people. they have myriad issues that they come up with and I mean insurance. Some of these complaints have got to be somewhat real. You know, they don't make as many oversized clothes plus sized clothes. It's harder to get styles or there's some legit stuff you know, that they might want to say, hey, what can we do something about this? But on the other hand, the whole thing that like saying that it has nothing to do with health, it has nothing to do with your triglyceride levels. It runs it's anti evidence. It runs in tHe face of every conceivable piece of evidence. There are teaching kids this, they're in schools and there are classes, fat studies classes, and there was an actual, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. There's fat studies journal publIshed the fed fat studies. Jamie's going to bring it up.

Speaker 2:          01:06:12       I told you, I told you 30 million people are waiting to find out real journal of body weight and this is what jim was telling me. He's like, when when we do this, 30 million people are going to now know that there's something fat. Now fat studies doesn't do what you think it does. You probably think, oh, fat studies, you know what? A triglycerides, how much should you exercise? Good diet. How much sugar is too much sugar? Well, that is aBsolutely not what this journal does. Frozen a fat tail of immigration. What the hell? Rafting weight stigma. Hold on a second. Crafting weight stigma in swimming classes. A case study in Ireland, so, so I'm tellIng you, you go to a swimming class, you're going to go lose weight. You take a take a fitness class or something. Whatever slimming classes are fatness in temporary use a stigma against being fat.

Speaker 2:          01:06:58       They they basically say fats bad for you. This one, theorizing, fat oppression, intersectional approaches and methodological innovations. You just said a bunch of nonsense. The oppression of fat people as built into institutions pervades the cultural landscape in effect. Dude, we could have written this and affects the relationship and perceptions of people of size, people of size. Is this introduction to the special issue on flip size? It's not the new people of color. More people of color is a problem now to. Yes you can, but you see there's people of color and then there's bi poc, which I don't know how you pronounce it off, it's bipap or what, but uh, that would be black and indigenous people of color because they have even more oppression than the other people of color. And they got a fight and yellow people of color. Yeah. For example, or probably brown.

Speaker 2:          01:07:47       Harvard can discriminate against asians that are trying to get in, let's tap our noses and just move on. Right? So, so, but then that's even a problem because indigenous has recent recently been branded a racist term because you're not actually honoring. Yeah. You're not hitting the actual tribal identity if you get right on the cutting edge of this stuff. It's like really going into meltdown closeness is because it's too random. Well, yeah, you're just. You're not. You're generalizing your chair. What exactly? Nez perce. Yeah. Okay. So you can see again, the competitive victimhood going on who gets to claim more of the victimhood pie and oh now we've got this thing about people of color. so they get, you know, victimhood status, but why? If that goes to all people of color equally, that's not fair because these people of color even more dIscriminating it so they should get more of it.

Speaker 2:          01:08:35       It's really, they're fighting over a piece of a pie of victim hood nus. I love the canadian term first nations first nation people. It's, it's a better term because really fucking every single human being that came to north America came from somewhere else. So it's just being a witch in the. In the fap, since we're talking about in the fat bodybuilding paper. Oh yeah. I put in a star trek reference at the end. I love star trek. I put in something like fat bodybuilding is the final frontier for fat activism. Oh, they didn't like to go. They didn't like that they said it was so that we couldn't use the word frontier because it evokes imagery of the genocides America, the american native americans, to choose a different word. yeah. Yeah. You're holy shit. Think about frontier airlines, right? What's up with them? They're in trouble.

Speaker 2:          01:09:23       Their whole worldview is so utterly distorted and twisted and the things you believe are totally untethered to reality, but yet you believe there's knowledge. You believe it's knowledge because it's published and think about what it does. The students had picked this stuff up. You go to college, you picked us up, you start majoring in it. You could be majoring in something where you actually learn to do critical thinking, to engage with ideas. If your dIstrict, if you're, if you're disadvantaged going into college, that's your best chance to get out of that situation is to grapple with great critical thinking. Learn some great skills, whether that's, you know, engineering and the sciences, something like that. Whether it's even if it's you want to get into like studying race in sociology, soft sciences, or you want to get into just literature do it honestly, and you're going to get somewhere, but you get into this stuff where you can literally just make up your conclusions.

Speaker 2:          01:10:09       What are you doing? You're teaching these people how to think about problems or seeing the burger and the santa monica pier is a problem. Now I see it everywhere I go after I did this for a year. So you get the people in the habit of seeing problems everywhere. Are you helping them? Are you getting them at a book about this or anything? You know, we might one day that's a great idea for a book. The hard part is we could actually probably write 10 books, so condensing it down to a book, usually you got an idea and you have to blow it up to a book. We have to condense this down to a book and they're talking about the problem, like just explaining what you've already explained on this podcast and, and, and actually having those studies that you did publish and the whole thought process behind creating them will be a great book.

Speaker 2:          01:10:52       We got a documentary happening about it. Mike nina is a documented tarian from, uh, from Australia that got hooked up with a z, a white male. He's not around. He's half black, half black watch album. How we met mike. oh yeah. So, um, it's interesting because we were starting out this project and then we up talking and we couldn't talk to anybody about it. It's so hard to keep a fucking secret this big. Right? You just want to tell people like, you aren't gonna believe what I'm doing. Can't tell anybody. So we fInd a few trusted friends were telling us one guy, a buddy of ours, and he's like, oh my god, I know a documentary ian, who's making, who's investigating all this shit going on in the universities already. He's already interested. Would you guys be interested in this will be a compelling documentary? Would you guys be interested in talking to them?

Speaker 2:          01:11:39       So we, we get in touch with him and he's like, listen, you know, I'll shoot this. I think there's a, there's a film here, I think you're going to ruin your career. so that's what I'm going to film. But in any case I'll film this, but here's the deal. I'm only going to shoot it if you commit 100 percent transparency. Let me tell the full story. honestly, what's really happening? You know, we don't get to sugar coat anything and make you guys look good. And of course he thought we were just gonna crash and burn. That's the only reason I agreed to this. I was sure that you guys got a torpedo your careers like positive. Yeah. And so he thought It was going to be that and you'd have to convince us to let him show it because we wouldn't want to. But does he know that you don't work in academia anymore?

Speaker 2:          01:12:20       Yeah, yeah, yeah. But we were doing the project, so we reached out to him and said, well, through the mutual friend, how would it ruin your career? Well, I maybe would never get another job if I wanted to go back into academia for example, or I mean I still, it hasn't happened yet, but you see people who do academic misconduct get banned from ever publishing academic papers again, that could still come down for me. I don't know what it probably won't, but it might. And if it does, you knoW, then if I tried to get a job working for like a think tank or university or anything that depends on that, I'm locked out of that now. So, um, especially it's going to ruin pizza career too. Let's be honest. He works in, he works in not just the university of portland state, you know, it's like ground zero for you.

Speaker 2:          01:13:03       I don't know. I don't know. It's going to happen when it's over for sure. They're always like, I'm not sure what's going to happen. No, it's best not to prognosticate too much with this stuff you see now we talked about bret weinstein and heather a hiring. They got firebombed right there. Thing just blew up, blew the hell up. And then they got pushed out of their jobs. But in a sense it's like, I don't know what I was talking to them when we were in portland and it feels like they kind of took the fall and people are like, whoa, that's too far and I don't know if that's the case or not, but if so maybe that's too far. like pushing people out of their jobs, like students patrolling the campus with bats, trying to find brett to pull them out of his car.

Speaker 2:          01:13:44       If he showed up like that, I don't care who you are. That's too far. I mean that's not even civil society who thought that was too far though the students is not there, but a lot of people, like people saw this. The role men is like. Did you think it was too far? Right? I thought it was insane. I think the government should have come in and shut down the school. Yeah, tons of people. Tons of people around. I mean like everyday people who saw this story think, whoa shit, this stuff's gone too far. The fact that they're allowing that guy to remain as president. Oh yeah. It's absolutely not. Absolutely

Speaker 1:          01:14:12       not. When there's that scene in the car, wherever it was, conference room or wherever it was, when the kids were telling him to put his hands down because he's being aggressive with his hands, he puts his hands down and they start laughing. I was like, what in the fuck is this? It is a system set up to where you can't win is what it is. Deliberate, but it's hilarious, but they were laughing at him. He put his hands down. They're like, stop making hand gestures. You're being aggressive. He puts his hands down. They started last. Sorry last night and I didn't find it funny. I found it terrifying. It's. I find it terrifying for what it means for all of us. Yeah. If that. If that can happen at a college campus, I mean that's where ideas are supposed to be shared, disgust explored, etc. If that can happen at a college campus, everything's up for grabs at some point.

Speaker 1:          01:14:54       Was that college campuses really strange? It's really strange. We're struggling now and have radically radically down. Yeah. I mean they could literally go under because of this. It looks like it might happen. Yeah. It's too bad because when it was doing well, as brett was explaining, it was a wonderful place to teach because he could do whatever he really cool stuff. He could take them to the park and they could do a class in the park. They could. He. He could have a class where, you know, whatever. Regardless of what he's teaching, he could teach you about something else. Crazy field trips somewhere, you know, all this stuff, you know, adventures with the students, the creator of the simpsons go there to speaking simpsons. I think he was an alum from there. It's such a shame because they're just such decent people. They're just such great. They're both great. They're smart too, so really legitimately smart and fiercely progressive, progressive, decent humans. Of course that means they're outright adjacent.

Speaker 1:          01:15:54       Fucking hilarious man. These people. It's a strange, strange time for ideas, but I think this is. It's also subs. It's some sort of a symptom of this culture that we live in where everyone gets to voice their opinion. EverYone feels entitled divorced because of social media, because of this instantaneous ability to post whatever you feel about anything. Whether it's a comment on youtube or a tweet or a facebook post, this nature of everyone putting in input instead of earning your right to be heard, you know, through merit and through your work and through people saying, hey, this guy is smart, this girl has great ideas, this person really has some good points. That's tom. Tom nichols ideas. Before we used to criticize people from a point of expertise. Now people who have absolutely no expertise feel that they're entitled to not only criticized, but have everybody else listened to the criticisms. I think you're onto something with the social media, right? Because you post something and it gets like four interactions and you're like, why? How come joe rogan's thing got like 4,000? It's not fair. Right? And so there's this like kind of competitive jealousy kind of thing going on and I think we've seen that a lot.

Speaker 2:          01:17:10       You know, these kind of, you know, people who don't have a lot to bring to the table and they want to get, you know, maybe it's a spot on a podcast, maybe they want to get on a conference or something. Speaker in a conference, and we've seen this for years, what happens is, well, you know you got some big name that's coming. Well, let's just can him and say, well, he's a sexist. He said this terrible thing. Now he can't be at the conference or will protest. Get him out, put one of our guys in or when they start to get more power, it's like, let's make sure half of our people are there or else we're going to make sure that we sell your conferences racist. Then that becomeS like just a hot mess. Nobody wants to go to the conference. It's not going to be financially soluble so it falls apart. I mean this stuff has been going on. This seems to be what's going on and I think you're touching something where social media and tom nichols talks about it to generating a kind of narcissism where people feel entitled, like I have a voice. Nobody's listening to me, but they should listen to me because they of course think that their ideas are great

Speaker 4:          01:18:05       and the rise of social media coincides with shutting down. Speakers absolutely occurs on campus. It didn't use to happen that way, used to be even if people protested it, the speech went on and people debated that person or the people got a chance during the q and a section to challenge these ideas. That's what it's all about. What it's supposed to be all about. Yeah. If you have a problematic person, you have a person that you feel is at. They have ideas that are questionable. You bring in a person whose ideas you feel our counter and you let the audience see how these individuals discussed these things. When I was in highschool, barney frank debated some guy from. He was a very conservative person. I forget what the. There was a ridiculous conservative group that had some really funny name. Uh, I forgot what it was, but he was like, this really can.

Speaker 4:          01:19:00       Ronald reagan style conservative and barney frank was. I think he was still in the closet back then, but he was this like very articulate, powerful left wing guy and they did it inside this a community center in our high school, whatever it was, you know, some auditorium. And I got a chance to watch this one guy talk about all these different, what you know, whatever it was, gay marriage or whatever is conservative ideas and values and a marriage should be between a man and a woman and all these different things that would today at a lot of college campuses, you'd want those shutdowns. You don't want someone propagating these ideas, but barney frank came on after him and eloquently dissected what was stupid about it and what the constitution is all about. What makes America great is our freedom and our ability to express ourselves. And by doing so, me as a 16 year old kid and the audience got to see ideas, dissected and ideas debated and see two people from polar opposite perspectives. just battle it out and let the best idea win. And I'm sure there was probably some people that were in that audience that came out of it with a different perspective. Like, yeah, gay people shouldn't get married and yeah, marriage is supposed to be between a man and woman. I'm sure of it. I'm sure of it. And that's what happens in a democracy.

Speaker 2:          01:20:29       Yes, you're talking about the very foundation of liberal society. You're talking about John Stuart mill here. I mean, did you talking about John Adams? You're talking about the foundation of a liberal society here and that's what the scholarship runs that were. We looked at runs directly counter to this. Remember the idea is that if people are putting out language, the idea that some people are going to come away with a heteronormative idea or a homophobic idea. That's already a catastrophe. Yes. Show. We can't allow it. We got to pull the speaker wires like demora event we've got. We can't let that go on.

Speaker 4:          01:21:01       yeah, that's my point is like what happened where know these kind of interactions between contrary ideas is so it's so dangerous that one or two people could possibly be shifted. I mean even if it's thirtY percent of the audience, I mean who the fuck knows what? What's gonna happen when people are sitting there listening and who's to say that you're right or you're wrong, that the way to challenge ideas is not pulling the plug on the speakers. It's a better ideas.

Speaker 2:          01:21:31       If you, if you fundamentally subscribed to the idea that heteronormativity, let's use it as the example of heteronormativity is the power structure that's holding down gay people and preventing them from having equal opportunities. If you fundamentally believe that anybody else getting convinced, anybody being reinforcement of the idea of heteronormativity isn't just a few like 70 percent changed their mind and 30 percent stuck with it. That's just bolstering the already imagined to be completely dominant view. It's really kind of anti progress, right? Because it views the idea that power structures can't change. They're always rooted in some identity. Whoever has, you know there's more straight people than gay people are. Okay, so therefore straight people always have power. Therefore anything that reinforces heteronormativity is going to be a catastrophe. That reinforces the next thing you know, people are going to be beating gays in the snow or something

Speaker 4:          01:22:22       that it's also the complete infant stylization of young adults because you're. You're telling me these young adults aren't smart enough to dIfferentiate between good ideas and bad ideas.

Speaker 2:          01:22:34       Well, if they're learning all this grievance study stuff, I just said their critical thinking is getting hobbled,

Speaker 4:          01:22:38       but if you're a person who's a young, progressive, well read person who's got some rock solid ideas about people being able to live their lives without discrimination and all the things that I'm sure we all agree on, and you sat and listened to some right wing, alright asshole spewing hate. Is it going to change you? It's gonna affect you. Of course it's not. So who is it going to affect?

Speaker 3:          01:23:06       Like who? Who are these ideas going to reach? Why do we assume that people are so much more easily influenced than we are? What, what is that about? this isn't this infant. Teleportation is young adults. Kids. It's fucking nerve in the world. And sharp corners. Got to put a fucking cane off and hide. Just published that. A book, the coddling of the american mind. And, and, and uh, I think if you look at [inaudible] work and the heterodox academy and he's fighting for this, but we have infant infantilize people, we've have infantilized students and I don't, I hope that the tide changing. I don't know, one of the things we wanted to do with this project is give people the opportunity to speak out and say, you know, they don't speak for me. I want to hear what someone has to say about immigration. The other side, quote unquote I want to hear which I want to hear the best arguments because then I want to engage them myself and you know, I also think that we should have people of all. I think it's a problem that people who go into teaching. I can't remember what the study I read the overwhelming percentage of people, college educators are on the left. I'm on the left. I think that's a problem. I think that they need diverse voices. diversity also has to be ideological diversity and if you want people to be less brittle and if you want people to be less infantilized, they have to hear the other side, but they have to hear. This is also a mills' idea. They have to hear it from people who believe it.

Speaker 2:          01:24:38       That's in John Stuart mill's book on liberty is it's not enough to have heard that. The other side. The argument from the other side exists, you need to hear the best case put forward by people who really, really subscribed to it and then work against that if you can defeat that, than it deserves to be defeated. Right? Yeah, and this is the thing I think in general, human beings, we all put forth our best ideas and we're all wrong. MosT of the time we're all. We can be a smart guy or a smart woman, whatever. We're all pretty stupid. We put forth a lot of ideas. Most of them are wrong. It's true for everybody, true for you, me, everybody and what we should really be relying on his. You know, I put it on an idea and you're like, well, I don't know about that.

Speaker 2:          01:25:15       And so we start cutting away the bullshit that I tuck tucked into my idea of the stuff I didn't have. Right? We do that and now the idea that survives that process is better, and then somebody else comes along and says, wait, wait, wait. That part's probably a little bit bullshit, but this you could add to it and then make it better. And then some of that's wrong and this is the process of how we really produce knowledge and it's a co two. That's what gives us a vibrant culture to write it as opposed to what we see here, where I can we, the three of us can make up a conclusion, write a paper to support it. And then if you criticize it, you had to have criticized it because you were sexist or because you were racist. If you do a scientific test that shows that it's wrong, the science must have been sexist or racist or anything. Once you're doing that, you're just, you're really in the weeds, you're not helping anybody. And we need to study areas,

Speaker 1:          01:26:04       gender and race, but we need to do it. Right? Yeah. And we need to do it freely where you could just talk and you don't, you, you don't get accused of all sorts of horrible transgressions. Exactly. And that's not, that's the culture that I, that we want to see in here. And that's not the culture we have. Well I think there's, you know, everyone is railing against identity politics. I think we can all agree identity politics are a huge problem, but another problem that goes along with it hand in hand is identifying personally with ideas where these ideas are connected to your ego identity. Exactly. Yeah. Did you call everybody'S wrong about god and it sounds like I'm just going to go after religion, but it's actually the culmination of my study of religious psychology and so really what it was was targeting pr. I mean it talks about what's going on with religion and why people believe religion and what god actually stands for in terms of psychology as it might see it, but then what was really targeting was I saw all these people who are like, you know, loud mouth atheists and they were like this and that and the other thing and they have this whole community and I saw, holy shit, they're doing the same thing.

Speaker 1:          01:27:11       Yes. They're doing the same thing and what are they doing? They're identifying as an atheist, I am an atheist. What does that mean? Well, I want to be a good atheist. How the fuck do you be a good atheist? It doesn't make any sense. You remember atheism plus atheism plus was exactly what I was looking at. Favorite was live, watched a whole speech like smoking a joint and laughing my fucking ass off at this dork who is speaking in front of some other group of dorks that we're all part of the atheism plus movement and he just kept just ranting about sexual harassment and diversity and all these different things and attaching them to atheist. Exactly. Motherfucker. You're making your own religion. Exactly. Exactly. That's exactly right. Hi. Joe rogan saw straight through. It was so fun because the guy was such a virtue signaling little weasel.

Speaker 1:          01:28:04       Totally. Totally. It was sneaky fucker. Yeah, a little sneaky fucker that was trying to get girls to like him. I guarantee you that. Yo, you see what it is though. I got to be a good atheist. How do I do it? Well, I don't know because atheist means don't believe stuff of a certain kind, so they have to start plus plus what social justice. How did that died off because it didn't work, but those people are still grumbling around or whatever. BuT what happened? Oh, they got a whole blog. They play about her project. Yeah. Said, yeah, we're straight white men. oh, well you're a straight white man were therefore we have bad motivations. Motivations. That's we get all time because we're straight white men because bad bad white men, straight white men are basically like a little arrow running around looking for vaginas and anything you say is basically just a little sneaky way for you to get inside of a vagina and all of this stuff. You just, you just try making your way through society. It's a little ironic when you Put it that way,

Speaker 2:          01:29:02       just what it is. right? But the truth is though, that if they think that the. I mean this is the article of faith years that privilege exists and always preserves itself. So we're straight white men. We criticized what supposed to be but isn't social justice work? It's bad. Social justice work, you know, capital social justice screwed up. So we criticize that. Therefore why we must be, because we're white man trying motivation or standard. Yep. You guys are a problem. that was the depth of their analysis, given that they're, you know, like some of them are professors and stuff that's the best they could come up with, been better to say, you know what, there's a problem here and we want to study this stuff and we need to clean house and thank you guys, we appreciate it, but you would have to step so far out of your belief system and be so objective and so self aware that you're realizing you're in some sort of a preposterous group and very few people are willing to admit that most of their life's work has been nonsense.

Speaker 2:          01:29:58       Yeah. Especially when you geT rewarded for that, you get promoted for that. you get accolades from that. You carry status and privilege. Look at me when people join some fucking wacky caught like they don't join it saying, yeah, this is bullshit, but it'll be fun. They didn't believe it. They buy into it and this is no different. It's like what we're talking about, about ideologies, how people they lock into these predetermined patterns of thinking and behavior and this is what's happening here and it's very much like a call. It's very much like any other group think sort of environment. It's like scientology grew up in the university, so everything they put out about threatens and volcanoes or whatever they've got all of a sudden that's not like just crazy. You know, l ron hubbard, was it dianetics or whatever. That's gold standard knowledge. Academic press, oxford.

Speaker 2:          01:30:49       So you get a degree. yeah. And then you get to teach it and as somebody. Somebody wrote an article criticizing us history and they're like, oh, they don't understand. You know, they thInk we just talked to each other in a bubble. We talk to policymakers, we talked to media and it's like, no shit. That's why we did this. You know, when you talk to you, you do talk to other people you are running into, you know, per sorry hr departments. You're telling them how to do the diversity officers and all those institutional and talk to policymakers. I get emails. I don't know if you saw a year before all this, we did this really, you know, bad attempt at it called conceptual penis as a social construct. So we said that penIses are social constructs and they cause climate change and this got a little bit of attention.

Speaker 2:          01:31:30       I've been getting emails ever since then from some member of eu parliament and they're like, we have another gender initiative that we're going to try to basically foist upon you and then it's going to like dictate how europe now works with africa going forward about climate. And so because I wrote this conceptual penis and climate change thing and it's all based on, you know, making fun of gender studies. It was at the time anyway, they were like, you know, you're an expert. So now that you use colomy, you know, what do we do about this gender initiative? But that's real, right? The, you parliament is not like nothing. That's not, that's not, you know, it's not like a meeting of some dorks at a conference that's real. They're coming up with policy to dictate how they want to interact with, with africa for the next 20, 30 years.

Speaker 2:          01:32:14       That's real. And these people are emailing me saying this scholarship that you guys are criticizing is really, you know, it's on the agenda of the eu parliament. So help. Alright, well it seems like what we're, what we have here is sort of a wave of ideas, right? It goes in and it goes out and it's going back and forth and you, you need this sort of balancing act and there are great things need to go so haywire that people step in and go, well I'm pulling my fucking kids at evergreen state. Yup. This is crazy. It. That's a great example of a place that went too far. Yeah, and what we don't want to have happen is we don't want people to pull their kids out of the universities know because there are some, not the university, but these departments don't major in it. Exactly.

Speaker 2:          01:33:04       Don't major in it, but it's which, which department? specific gender studies. Critical race studies, cultural studies, queer theory, fat studies. If it happens to have one. I've read a biography of guy who teaches critical whiteness. Oh yeah. CrItical whiteness is a thing that actually there was a journal and then it got. It got so out there that it got criticized out of existence, but it's a big thing. There's some big paper I was reading just before we went public with all this and I got asked about it. Luckily I read it because we did the mind calm. Of course Israel is like, you got mine comp published. Oh my god, we need to talk to you. Israel tv. I was on israeli tv. What the hell? And so all these israeli journalist or calling me talking to me about it and over the mind, confident I read this one paper.

Speaker 2:          01:33:50       They're lIke, well, do you think that jewish studies is like this? And I found this paper just before this all came out. There was jewish studies criticizing critical whiteness studies because there's this whole thing about how the critical whiteness people who accused the jews of being white and then there's all this, you know, who's, where does the oppression like. Because you know, the jews have had it pretty rough over the last 2000 years or thereabouts, but then you've got the critical whiteness people being like, no, they're white, it's a white privilege, blah, blah blah. And then the jewish studies people are like, hold up, you know, don't put us up here and say that we're all white supremacists, you know, we were gassed by the white supremacists. You chill out. So there's this huge, like critical studies fight between the jewish studies people and the critical whiteness people over whether jews count as white people are not and have white supremacy built in.

Speaker 2:          01:34:41       And they asked me about thIs israeli journalist said. And I was like, well, you know, I have to sympathize with what their, their argument is. But they're still using the same broken methods. And so you still want to see better methods. Right. I think the, the jewish people have a point, you know, we've been pretty heavily oppressed for 2000 years. You sTarted with like, you know, the romans decimating them and then the diaspora and then to holocaust and every it's just not good. So I think they have a point that, you know, don't just say, oh, we have crazy white privilege and are there for white supremacists, but if you want to do that, you know, maybe this methodology of, of, of complaining about it's not the best way to go. It's complicated stuff, but at least they're against the critical whiteness stuff. This critical whiteness thing you were saying is, is they have a journal.

Speaker 2:          01:35:29       They did the journal of whiteness studies or something like that. Critical whiteness. It lasted for about three years and I don't know exactly why it fell apart, but it fell apart because I was really upset because I wanted to send a paper to it and it doesn't exist anymore. What were you gonna say to the paper on the rewrite of mind for the woman that lesbian woman excoriates around whiteness. It was going to send it to that journal and then it doesn't exist anymore. So I had to send it to a critical race journal who then said, ah, it's a good idea, but you're positioning yourself as a good white and that's a problem. So we can publish. By the way, we would. They're all in line. We were completely transparent and honest with everybody. You can just google drive or google drive with every paper comments, comments to everything that mike made, his videos. Everything is up there. Yeah. It's totally free for everybody. Yeah. We get accused of being grifters. We don't have a how. How are we grifting? It's in a google drive that anybody can just go download all of it. I don't recall getting money for that. We want it. We really do think that that. And I'm.

Speaker 1:          01:36:33       Yeah, there you go. Swedish professor rebels. Oh yeah. A couple of days ago, one of sweden's most merited in claim political scientists and longterm critics of identity politics. Bow rothstein. Rothstein has argued that identity based disciplines like grievance studies, which deals with the concept of collective guilt, have no place in academia. Yeah. Grievance studies is. Yeah, right on. Yeah, we, we, we, we came up with greed and study, so delighted to see that that's caught on to start a podcast immediately and a patrion page so that you don't have to worry about losing your house. Yeah, exactly. I mean, I don't know how it is in Sweden. Yeah, I don't either, but that guy's probably screwed. Whatever the fuck they did with Jordan Peterson, they created a god damn monster. Oh yeah. You guys fucked up. Guys created a multimillionaire whose worldwide famous and there's a huge bestseller and he was just talking to swedish politicians on tv the other day, so watch out. They fucked up with him. Boy, did they fuck up and dave was just texting me. A friend. Reuben was just texting me pictures that all full. It's crazy in the energy in that place is crazy. He's selling out 5,000 seat theaters. He's a rock star. It's a fucking rock star. He's an intellectual rockstar. It's hilarious. Good for him. Yeah. I mean, look, a lot of other guys are doing it to sam harris is doing that as well.

Speaker 3:          01:37:56       They're doing these gigantic huge speeches. It's like good for him. What will absolutely good for him, but what I'm excited about is how many people are interested in the debate of ideas and that this is not happening on the college campuses, but a lot of these people that are graduated have graduated from college or or you know, in the working world. They're very fascinated by this.

Speaker 2:          01:38:22       It's real. It's what you were saying. It's been suppressed for long enough now. Jordan peterson, what was his thing? He was like, you're not going to tell me the words I can use when they're 78 different words for genders. I can safely say you're fucking crazy. That's like this desperation to try to find a unique identity that you can consider it to be super special or whatever. It's totally, but it's. And you want to see even crazier as you go into, like you go on these blogs. I Think they're mostly on tumblr or something that violates my rule. never use tumbler where they talk about the different sexual sexuality identities, like different kinds of, you know, I'm interested in this kind of personal but not this kind of person under these circumstances but not under those that has like some 18 syllable academic word for it now and there's people whose whole, I don't think their academics. I think there are activists geeks on tumbler, but they come up with these crazy descriptions and there's like hundreds of sexual orientations.

Speaker 3:          01:39:17       Yeah. It's just people wanting to be different. I think it'd be special and they're not good at anything. That's I think something that was the other part of. I guess one of the things that jim said when I said I was more cynical, I think that the in general, the critics tend to be angry and I'm not saying that their anger is legitimate or illegitimate, but they send to be angry. They seem to be almost universally under accomplished, so they're upset at you because you have whatever, a big show or lot of fault or they're whatever. They're upset about big platform audience there. They're just generally disagreeable people and they found these communities of other people who are enraged, who are also under accomplished, who they can laugh, they can lash out at people together, and then virtue signal you get rewarded for all know rogan that bat whatever they want to call you or whatever they want to call us or whoever else, some kind of an oppressor, some pressure, and that there's something that.

Speaker 3:          01:40:14       So I don't know how we can deal with that. I mean was our attempt to do this was to try to de legitimize where they get their knowledge from, like what they call knowledge, what they could point to. We tried to say it's not knowledge and de-legitimizing, but we really do need to get back to some kind of productive discussion, productive politics where the far right disown they're lunatics and we disown are lunatics and we get back to work about whatever the oceans, plastic, whatever it is that we're talking about, because right now the discourse is corrupted it. We're not doing what we need to do in the. These people

Speaker 2:          01:40:54       are continuing to pump out this nonsense. that's totally untethered reality. It's a huge problem. I'm sick of it. You're sick of it. We're all sick and we're sick of. I'm sick of it. I've had it. I've had it with these folks. It just doesn't seem. It doesn't seem like it's sustainable. I don't think it is. It seems like some weird thing that's going to run out of energy towards eating itself constantly eats itself like we did. The thing about the the people of color and the black indigenous people of color that they fragmented. You see when you get into the critical race literature that it's like, okay, so you're brown or black, but you have slightly lighter skin, slightly darker skin is slightly darker than that. Really dark. They have different levels of privilege and it's just cutting things apart. The idea though that this is going to create some kind of a coalition that can then defeat the plurality or something like that is ridiculous.

Speaker 2:          01:41:42       So what do you see? You see this stuff starting to blow up. You see the democrats bleed seats. They've lost lIke a thousand legislative seats across the u. S since obama got elected in [inaudible] eight. How are you going to get your agenda if you don't have any legislators, if you don't have anybody elected, and so then what happens? Two thousand 16. I don't. I can't say that the reason that trump got elected because there's lots of reasons it had something to do. No, I will say I had something to do with this because every conservative person I know that's not just a reactionary is like. And I live in the soUtheast man. I, I know some conservatives, most of my friends who are conservatives, because I don't have a choice if I want to have friends that they're going to be conservatives who lives there. So I talked to them and they're like, oh yeah, they're tearing down this statue.

Speaker 2:          01:42:26       Oh yeah. It's tough. And it's not like they're tearing down confederate statues are turning on Thomas Jefferson, you know, it's like there. George Washington, George Washington halloween's a problem. Then I didn't know. You didn't know how it means a problem. What are you going as for halloween? I'm a shark. You're a sharp. My kids are mermaids. Problematic. Oh god. If they're mermaids and you're a shark, you're definitely taking like a dominant power position. Power. They. I don't pick my off that I have kids. They tell me what I am. Not an issue, but I don't know. I'll try to figure out a paper for that. Halloween. Halloween? Yes. Oh god. Cultural appropriation. Why apologizes for tropic thunder? Simple jack costume. Oh no. He dressed up as a black person. You know? Simple. Jack is the mentally handicapped. Okay. Okay. That's all right. It's junior. Might be the last guy ever to wear black face. Yeah, that's true. Pull it off. What are they? Gonna. Pull that. That show. What are they goIng to pull? Tropic thunder is problematic. I don't even. There's probably a tropic thunder.

Speaker 2:          01:43:31       It's wonderful. You'll love it and it's. It's special. Highly politically incorrect. It's politically and writing it down. Tropic thunder is. It is a fucking great move is a gem. It's a great movie. Now we're going to be racists and abelist for saying that. It's funny for short. We've got real issues. We do halloween again. Halloween is mostly, It's. There's a lot of cultural appropriation going on, so somebody might dress up like a put on a sombrero and a poncho. That's an issue, especially on tuesdays. We have tacos today. You know, you can't be a native american, you can't be a native american. There's that big stink just now about the victoria's secret fashion show where they had like their indigenous, you know, colors and the feathers they were wearing and walking around half naked. You can't do that. So the idea mostly that people are going to take costumes that are insensitive to other people's cultural appropriation, cultural appropriation. So it's not dress up as Bruce Lee. Oh man. I don't know. MaYbe for awhile for a harvard, maybe because he's asian and then it gets complicated, but no, this all blew up at yale a few years ago I thought for sure. He's. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. How do you spell hIs last name? christakis I think christakis. Yeah, sometime soon. Yeah, he's supposed to. He's a good guy. Um, yeah. That was hilarious. It was kids screaming at screaming at him. Safe place. Yup. It was just his wife

Speaker 1:          01:44:54       put out a email saying maybe it's okay to believe politically incorrect on halloween.

Speaker 2:          01:45:00       It was. Yeah. It was just, you know, choose your costume, how you're going to choose it. We're all adults. It's probably bad to be deliberately offensive and yet it's also bad to overreact to incidental stuff. Oh yeah. It's all this stuff. You kNow, like little girls if are white can dress up as milan.

Speaker 1:          01:45:18       oh, that's right. Behind us or about pocahontas is a new one. Yeah, pocahontas problem. But I think Bruce Lee is still on the menu. I don't think anybody's getting in trouble for being Bruce Lee. You could wear it like the track suit where I get the treks didn't. That's a big footprint across my chest, right footprint. We our cream of kicked in, but a lot of people go with the. Like the cutS. oh yeah. The. Oh yeah. Yeah. I don't have enough apps for that. That's going to be a bad costume for what is it is. Yeah. You could buy a Bruce Lee costume. Look for now, for now, for now. Who knows? it comes with a weight to dope for now, even a baby costume. Look at that. Look at that. Obviously chinese babies, chinese. That's fine. Yeah. That guy's fucking guy. No, no, not allowed. Can't be a ninja. No way to cultural appropriation. a boy this, this mess that we're in. Is there a light at the end of the tunnel?

Speaker 2:          01:46:17       Nothing. So. Yeah. Yeah, I think so. Uh, the response that we've got so far has been really positive, but it's all like the secret positive. So the feeling I get is academia. Well from academics. Yeah. the general public has been way more positive than that. PosItive for positive. So the wind is changing, right? If we're getting that much, we've got no real blow back. We got, we got lots of posItivity from the public. Even academics are reaching out there like secret positive with them. It's like one more thing, right? We need a critical mass because what they are is they're all lined up. They know the first one to step out of line and challenged the stuff's getting shot. So like the communist situation, after communism fell, nobody really believed it anymore. But they had to go along with the party are going to get shot, but if a whole bunch of people come forward at once, they can shoot everybody.

Speaker 2:          01:47:01       So if feels like we're in that powder keg situation now, right where all it's going to take is we hoped it was going to be this, you know, our, our thing was going to be the trigger that like 30 percent of academics come forward and say, you know, it's bullshit and if enough people start saying it, other people start feeling safe to say it and we wish them where people feel safe, you know, we took a risk, it's been fine for us and we'll see what happens to pete. But if more people will take that risk and start speaking out, then there's change coming. Now. You were, you were a mathematician and that's your background. And in academia that would appear at least to be something that is beyond all this stuff because it's just dealing with numbers. Yeah. Math itself mostly has not been touched by this, but there's this whole branch in there that's called the studies of science and technology.

Speaker 2:          01:47:47       And mostly what they go after is, you know, the sciences or whatever, especially they go after, um, biology and psychology and they feel like they've got a lot of inroads into that. We wroTe the astronomy paper to try to push that all the way to a hard science. We've said that astronomy is sexist and can only be fixed by putting in queer horoscopes. they thought that was a good project. They keep asking them to rewrite it. Yeah. They keep asking me to submit that. I got an email yesterday asking for that one again. So even though we've come public. So with math mostly where you see this stuff hitting though, they don't. I mean some people are saying that math is inherently got sexism and racism because I guess apparently women and minorities are going to be naturally bad at numbers is what they're assuming.

Speaker 2:          01:48:30       I don't know what they're assuming does it, that's ludicrous. But they mostly go after educatIon. So they say, oh look, the scores on the sat math scores or whatever For, for men, white men are higher than for, for black men or something like that. Why could that be? Well, you know, maybe there are a lot of factors that go into that, but they Don't give a shit about a lot of factors. it's racism, so therefore math education must be racist. Therefore we need social justice initiatives in math education and that's exactLy what they do. And so then you have diversity math and I don't know even know what that is, but it's not something that you would see like at mathematics research level, it's something that you see at junior high school, elementary school that they're teaching your kids, which is why it's scary as hell.

Speaker 2:          01:49:12       So is there a light at the end of the tunnel and what do you still think? There's a lot. I think people hate this stuff. I think people are getting sick. I hate it. Hate it. Hate it too though. But they're afraid. Yeah. I had this guy come up to me repeatedly last week. This guy, he's got two phd, brilliant guy. He comes up to me repeatedly. What you did is so important. It's so necessary. I can't talk about it. I'm sorry. I can't talk about it. I wish I could talk about it, but I talked to a lot of academics and everybody's saying the same thing. They know you got them. It's only a matter of time now. One more event and theY shake off the fear. I think it's close. I don't knoW what the next event is. I don't think it's more bogus papers. I think it's probably somebody's getting fired that didn't deserve it or something like that. One more thing and people are going to be ready to shake this off it.

Speaker 4:          01:49:57       Why does this ideology, in fact, tech companies and it seems to get them more than it gets anyone else. We should ask them more that I don't know. He's. He's fucked. If I can't get a job. He just gone. I just to him the other day, he just gone, well, don't say where he's working. Oh, definitely. They'll go after him. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          01:50:18       No, why? It's in tech so much. Maybe there's some kind of silicon valley connection there or whatever where you know silicon valley is in, you know the kind of bay area, California. You've got a lot of the liberal hippie stuff that started out as you were talking about in the sixties and seventies, so it's kind of in the water there in general. I would say that what you're seeing is that this stuff, as they've got the big turn to making this applied was in the nineties. Right? So they've had an entire generation of students that have just been really getting this stuff crammed down their throat. They really have taken over the education in the last 10 years. It was just starting when I left academia in 2010 that, you know, it was like, oh, we're going to focus on diversity. We're in a diversity committee, commitments, what's going to get into general curriculum.

Speaker 2:          01:51:01       So you're getting more and more students that are getting educated in this, that is now going out into the workplace. Right. So if half your workforce in tech, Because tech moves so fast, I'm just guessing why this might be a thing. Tech was really fast, so you've got to have some fresh training go in there. If they've been educated with diversity, stuff's crammed down their throat the whole time and there's huge initiatives to try to, you know, increase representation of women in particular in, in tech and these are seen as, you know, automatically good initiatives. If there has been, this is the culture that they're, that they're being educated in, and then they take that culture to the workplace and think this is what tech is about, and then they're surrounded by likeminded people who encourage it. It's totally plausible that which you've got to sort of a tech echo chamber that's bouncing these things around and keeping it, keeping it there.

Speaker 4:          01:51:51       Here's another question. Why is it that, I mean, here's, here's, here's the scenario, right? The scenario is universities are almost predominantly taught by people that are on the left. It's massive. It's in the 90 percent range, right? when you have this sort of environment of these nonsense ideas that are accepted as fact and taught and put into published papers, then you have a situation where the left routinely attacks itself and and, and devours Itself for not being left enough. You're always having people that are upset that someone's not progressive enough, leftwing people attacking leftwing people. You do not see that on the right.

Speaker 2:          01:52:39       No, you did. That's kind of what the whole tea party movement was. Right, but they didn't do it in the academic field because they didn't power there because they weren't academics. right? Well, yeah. That shift started in the sixties and seventies. They started bringing in these field when that was during the obama administration, so that's when. What was the biggest fear for every republican congressman then was that they're going to get primaried from the right, so they were going to have some populist. Yahoo goes screaming about whatever they scream about. It was going to be more to the right, harder conservatism, conservative movement, capital c, capital m kind of thing, and they're going to just drill into the, you know, the reason that, that the conservative politics aren't succeeding is because we're not conservative enough, is that's the, the prevailing view where I live in the southeast.

Speaker 2:          01:53:21       so same thing as you see in the universities, but reversed in terms of, of polarization. So, but isn't thAt just an excuse for the lack of success? It is. It's, it's a, it's within excuse combined with a commitment to the ideology, whether it's conservative movement ideology, whether it's a social justice scholarship, whatever it happens to be. Right. But you see far more of these left on left attacks they need do write on right attacks you do right now. Yeah, certainly. Except of course for election time, certain people were trying to beat their opponents. Sure, sure, sure. It just, it seems to be that there's somehow or another related. I mean I would like to look at how many people on the left will attack others for not being progressive enough, not being left enough. So I think it's a panic, rIght? You see this is the kind of behavior you see in a panic, a moral panic, for example.

Speaker 2:          01:54:18       And so helen and I, the third person who worked on the project with us, helen and I wrote an essay about a year and a half ago and talking about how the extremism on both sides is really the problem and most people reject it and should fight it. Most of us are sensible people in the middle who hate this. In fact, data just came out showing that it's 80 percent of the population, the fringes, both sIdes. So n only eight percent are on the left and 12 percent are on the right of the fringe. However that works out. And so we wrote this thing and we said, what's going on? Actually we called it existential polarization. So you have this idea that everything's an existential crisis. So the the far right, we'll start with them, sees that if the democrats get power, oh, it's open borders. The terrorists are coming in.

Speaker 2:          01:55:05       Our entire way of life is going to be destroyed. Catastrophe, catastrophe, ono, judith butler's, you mean 95 genders? Quick stop the democrats no matter what. And then you have the left. Oh my god, if they get power that everything's going to be racist, we're going to be beating gays in the snow. It's going to just be the worst thing. That's actually kind of a joke, but, but it's, it's for real though, that they think that the world is going to fall apart. If the other side it gets power and so when you have that kind of a situation, you have a panic and you see the slightest bit of advantage happening on the other side is just something to completely freak out about. And then what do you do? You say, oh well the only possible recipe to balance the scales to turn further our way.

Speaker 2:          01:55:43       If we go toward the middle, that puts the balance. SaY if the right goes really far right and we on the left, moved toward the middle. Now the whole balance has moved, right? So the only way to keep the balance close to the middle is if they go right, we go left, right? Right. So then that's going to keep the balance. But what that actually does is it. This is going to get nerdy. Hang on. That actually puts all of the weight on the outsides and you think about a spinning thing, right? It's got centrifugal forces happening. What's that trying to do is going to rip the spinning thing apart? Well, if you have all the weight crammed in the middle, like wheel, it doesn't come apart right now. imagine if you had like two billiard balls and you have like this big long stick and there's two holes for the builder bars.

Speaker 2:          01:56:23       They don't go in it like locked in there, just sitting there. You spend that. What's going to happen there? Fly right off, right? So if you have all the weight on the outside and you start spinning a thing, so that's like the political conversations. That dynamic is going to rip the thing apart. The more weight gets to the outside. So one side go into the fringe doesn't mean the other side should go to the fringe. That's how you tear a nation apart. That actually makes a lot of sense. If you can conceptualize it like an object. There's really a damn good youtube video floating around out there where somebody takes a jet of water in, spins a skateboard wheel until the centrifical force gets so high from it spending so fast, it rips it apart. It's it's worth looking up. I don't know what the hell you'd search to find it, but it's a powerful visual and you can see it as stuff moves to the outside.

Speaker 2:          01:57:04       The centrifical force goes up and up and up until finally the thing that the structural integrity of the thing that's spinning can't hold itself together. Anyone it rips apart. Well, listen gentlemen and a shout out to your friend. What is her name? Nine. Uh, oh, helen. Helen. Oh, Helen Rose. Rose across the pond. Um, thank you guys for doing this. Really appreciate it. Thanks for being here, man. I appreciate your support because we need support. We can't do this without support, so thanks for having us. My pleasure. Thanks for doing it. Where can people see these things? Where can they read them? The best place to go is going to be to go to our film makers youtube page, mike naina on the youtube that just a n a n a y and a and a y and so on. His youtube pages, some videos. He's kind of playing with the footage that he's collecting for the documentary.

Speaker 2:          01:57:50       On top of that though, if you go to the video we originally released, which is on the page, you can find it easily. There's the link to the google drive is linked to all of the documents we put out winters. We explained what every paper does, why we wrote it, what we were trying to show with writing the papers, what the problem is that we need to address and what you know, what we think that this shows and what we can do. It's all accessible through his youtube channel. We're kind of making that a central hub and so people can go there and explore and watch some more videos of us and we'll. Thanks for beIng here. This was a lot of fun. Again, I really appreciate what you guys do and thanks man. Thank you. Bye everybody. Thank you.
