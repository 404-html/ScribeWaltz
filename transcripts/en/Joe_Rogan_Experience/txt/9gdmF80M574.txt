Speaker 1:          00:00          Her low freak bitches. I trademarked it because I said, you know what it was, it was starting to like, you know, physio when I was like, I was really passionate about it because it's something I was saying again. I didn't have nobody around me, no. Used to have friends with me all the time. I'm training, whatever, whatever. They all left. They was always moved on. So for me, I was like, no entourage, nobody to push me. I got to push myself. So I started talking to myself, something that I ever did. And that's a whole nother story. I wanna tell you in the book why I refuse to talk to myself. Why does your feet tell me? I was saving it for book talking, but I'm still really, I'm selling the book, man. Let me know. Put up links.

Speaker 1:          00:40          If we go in that route, then I already know. Come on Doug. But no, the reason why is because, um, I had an uncle, my mother's brother Anthony Par Ham. He was her only brother. He went to the military, he went to the Vietnam war as a child. You know, he's a young man, 18 years old. When he left high school, he didn't have to because it was all sisters and he wanted to because he wanted to go because everyone in the rented town, Petersburg, Virginia, excuse me, Jarret, Virginia, everybody from his town, the young men will go on its own cousins and everybody. So he went, he came back, um, disturbed. He came back different than when he went in and he was actually missing for quite a time that they were going to declare him dead when he showed up one day, um, with a trench coat on army boots and naked and hosie street in Brooklyn.

Speaker 1:          01:23          So this led to him being mentally disturbed all my life. He would talk to himself. He lived with us. I slept in a twin bed here and he slept in the bed there and he was with alcohol. He drank, he became very violent. You know, he beat my mom up one time really bad cause I had eyes up and him talking to himself with something. I grew up all my life watching and I'm like, amy crazy. You called amy amy, you crazy. You can't. He told me to itself so, and I got older, I would just refuse to even have a conversation with myself. Oh you crazy if you, and four years ago I started having conversations with myself. I was like, Yo, you know what champ, you got to go. And I start saying, let's go champ. And I was like, ma'am, I asked, my wife was so you think I'm crazy cause I spoke.

Speaker 1:          02:09          She was like, yeah, we already know you crazy. You know what I mean? So I'm like, you know, and it just, and that was my mantra. It became my mantra. You know, my friend told me one of his mantras was to be the man, you've got to be the man. When he was tired, he was running mile 18 to beat a man, you've got to beat the man, be the man. You gotta beat a man. I was just saying to himself and I was like, you know, I need a mantra, and I was hitting the bag one day and I was tired. I was like 400 pounds. I was like, let's go champ. That's gonna Chair. That's her chair. You know, and it's in the head champ. You know when I'm feeling pain, you feel in pain, you're feeling down. Tell yourself, let's go champ. Let's go champ. To what I hear you when I work out. Sometimes it's yours. I thought she didn't push it through and set as yours. It's yours. It's everybody's. It's the people's man. The people. The people gave me this, the universe gave me this, that people, the people

Speaker 2:          03:00          linked into it and it's not mine, it's ours. We just want to give each other positivity and love and I meet people from everywhere. Chan, I'm a little nuts because I go to every city or country and people say, chair, but I'm in the lobby or I'm in this town. Could I meet you? And I say, come over to the hotel. And they come. You know what I mean? They call. I mean, you might have to stop that when you went a people. I'm the people's champ. I'm free. I'm here for the people. Wow, man, that's strong. Uh, things. And when I went to, I interview Senator Mark Pocan last week about, he was the one that wrote a letter to the government. He wants to keep Kratom legal. He thinks that, you know, it should be allowed for everyone. And I said to him, what do you think about marijuana?

Speaker 2:          03:36          And he was like, I just think it should all be legal. And it was the first time I was ever in the presence of somebody that works for the government saying that they think that weed and Kratom and all this stuff should be illegal. And it's because he had a good head on his shoulders about the problems that people face every day. You know, it's not black and white. Like I live in this gray area, I don't, I, I'm in a lot of pain, but I don't want to take opiates and I shouldn't have to take opiates. So where's the pressure coming from to turn this stuff into a schedule one drug? If there's no, if there's no negative response by the body, you're not having people die of overdoses. Is there an ld 50 rate on this stuff? Well, if you look at it, you know, I mean you're saying where, where's the ld 50 explained?

Speaker 2:          04:19          We should probably explain to people lethal dose at 50% meaning if you take 50 rats and you give them a pound of this shit, 50 of them are 25 and die at a certain show. We've heard about, you know, there's been no deaths from marijuana, right? Right. Yeah. Freedom is the same thing. No, no deaths. There have been zero deaths and there, there have actually been 15 deaths that have been brought to the FDA and the dea is attention. Those 15 that's, I actually went and interviewed one of the, one of the mothers, the kid was on three psych meds. He was withdrawn. He was honored with withdrawing from three different psych meds. I have a black box warning that says, warning, if you're a teenager, you might commit suicide. Basically, and this kid committed suicide. He didn't die from a Kratom overdose. He died from committing suicide.

Speaker 2:          05:02          And his mother wants to blame Kratom. She doesn't think that the, uh, the psych meds had anything to do with it. And I don't want to say that Kratom had nothing to do with it. We don't really know. And what I really call for with Kratom is just more research. Like I want people to put in the money to do the research, to make sure that this is safe. And let's see if we can solve this opiate epidemic. Let's see if we can crack down. You know, basically lower the amount of opiate prescriptions we have in this country. I just read an article the other day. One in seven people in America are going to be affected with addiction problems. Wow, that's crazy. One in seven. Yeah. That means somebody in your family, that's insane. Somebody in your family will be be affected by it. And that's 10% yeah, that's weird.

Speaker 3:          05:50          [inaudible].
