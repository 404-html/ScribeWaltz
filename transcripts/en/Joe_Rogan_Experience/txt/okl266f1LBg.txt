Speaker 1:          00:00:00       Can we go for three to boom and we're live. Hello, Miriam. Hi Joe. Good to see you. Grab this mic and keep it like a fist from your face. That's a good reference point. Perfect. Perfect. Just like that. Yeah. Good to see you. Good to see him. I'm sad that you can't sell these snacks everywhere because I know you're, you're working on making these mass produced, but they're fucking fantastic. Yeah, they're very good. When did you first give me some of these? Like five years ago or some shit. Something like that. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. My knee blew out. I just had surgery and I needed something to do. So that was neat. Number one. The second one, that was the second one. And that was, and I've had two more sense. I've had four total. The life of a world champion. Moyie Thai kickboxer not an easy one.

Speaker 1:          00:00:57       Actually started when I started, we started at grappling. That's when it started blowing your out. Yeah, yeah. No, it was, I was, um, wait, time was fine. It got cracked ribs. I got cut. I got maybe concussions may be really bad. Like broke my elbow on. Somebody had. Yeah, but not, no, I'm nice stuff. It was the MMA, Jujitsu, wrestling and Jujitsu. A rough on the knees. This motion not awesome on the cartilage. It's like a weird emotion. You mean I'm like hip, stuff like that with your, so like a on your back or working in guard, that kind of thing. That's where you think that it, well, I just, yeah, and 20 years of use on this body. Yeah. Well it does put it put, it puts weight in weird ways. He's too, if someone's trying to pass your guard and they're moving your ankles.

Speaker 1:          00:01:49       Yeah. Just swivel with their weight and their violence directed at you. Yeah. I saw you getting a bunch of fluid on Instagram shot into there. What is that all about? Like Orthovisc what has that not help? No, that was a waste of money. That was, yeah, it was the Gulf, like a gooey fluid padding. Oh, is that what the idea is? But what was, what was really nice as I got a straight shot of Ibuprofen in there that felt amazing. Like three months worth of Ibuprofen. Just shot it right in there. That shit is so bad for you though. Is that it was, well it felt really good. Yeah. I tell everybody stay the fuck away from my Ibuprofen. Yeah. Doctor Rhonda Patrick is the first person that alerted me to it. The increased Reese of a risk of strokes and heart attack. And then, um, my friend Cam Haynes, who's an ultra marathon runner, he um, he was taking 800 milligrams a day every day for how long?

Speaker 1:          00:02:42       Forever. That's a lot. It's a lot. That's different. It is different. I just got one super shot. Well he was wrong. He basically runs almost a marathon a day. Yeah, that's crazy. Yeah. Cause he runs, he's 240 mile races. So he was having these series paints like he's like, I need it to get going. So I told him about all the heart attack stuff and the stroke stuff. He's like, fuck. So he gets off of it, all of his inflammation relaxes and calms down. Turns out what was going on was the Ibuprofen severely upsets your gut bacteria. And so when that happens, it causes systemic inflammation, which you then treat with Ibuprofen. So he takes out the Ibuprofen, all the, the gut problems go away. All the inflammation goes away, all his hip pains, knee pains, all that shit went away, which is crazy.

Speaker 1:          00:03:33       I think Ibuprofen is great if you do it every week, just rarely, you know something's going on. You need, what I noticed when he shot my knee that into my knee and meet like within the next week, you know, over the course of a couple of days I noticed that I had greater range of motion. So what it made me realize, it was like, oh, I had a little inflammation in there cause I was kept thinking. It was like, is it, is it the tissue tight? Is this homeboy shooting the wounded? What does he shoot it in here? This is, this is that stuff that didn't have gloves on? Yeah, it was have gloves on. Fucking doctors. This, where were you in a garage somewhere? Free Clinic. Would it? Oh Yo, look at you.

Speaker 1:          00:04:21       So what does that Orthovisc stuff supposed to do? Like give it padding. Yeah. It didn't really help. It was a waste of money and time. How much does that Shit Cross? I think it was like 200 or two 20 I shot and I just got three of them. Well maybe it's for like regular people, maybe it would work for regular people, not for people to throw him a lot of kicks. You know the kicks don't bother me and I bet it is the kicks. Right. I, I think I think about that like it is grappling, right? That is the thing that puts the most where on your, if you talk like you, you meet like old kickboxers. I mean some of them have brain damage for sure, but their bodies aren't as broken down as old. Grapplers no, they might be humbling a little bit. Know their toes, might kind of using rob.

Speaker 1:          00:05:03       Rob came in of him. Rob Is Rob Rob's foot look, look like he jumped into a pool that was empty land and on his big toe. Yeah, all of them. But when you're a guy like rob has been kicking shins and elbows for so long, he's amazing. It sucks. It hurts my heart that he missed the, um, the, the current human said, you know, the fame wave cause he's brilliant. He's fucking brilliant. He really is. Yeah. And he helped a lot of fighters too. I mean he was a big, big part of Br Brennan Vera's early success and uh, that's when I was training with them bomb squad days. Yep. And you know, he was working with a lot of kickboxers and even people were starting to catch onto his whole system, but I didn't even when I got to work with him, um, and I couldn't at the time

Speaker 2:          00:05:58       I was so, um, green as a fighter or just as a martial artist that I couldn't comprehend what he was trying to show me and tell me. And he's like, no, you're going to have programs, counters to the counters. And he was like trying to dial in me and programming and I couldn't keep up with him, you know, at the time it was just too, and wasn't at that level.

Speaker 3:          00:06:16       Well, you know what the difference is? Like some people just use athleticism and timing and they just, they just try to be creative. What he does is he has a full system of like what to do in varying positions and what to do depending upon your opponent's reaction, but then on top of that there's also creativity, which is and savagery. Yeah. Oh yeah. He's a savage mother fucker. Yeah. He's very sad. What is the highlight reel? Pullup rob his highlight reel. I mean he, he not points stash in the right. That's the thin. Then rob came. It's really incredible when you think about like how many great fighters came out of Holland and kickboxers in particular. It's just one small country and here it is right here. Get to see some of it. Look at, rob came following up on a motorcycle. Sexy Bitch. So stoic to angry. Well back in the day he was, which is really interesting if you know him now because he's so friendly and huggy and he's like a big fluffy dog. He's a fascinating guy. He really is, but his, his knowledge of, of kickboxing, he's just so fucking tremendous.

Speaker 2:          00:07:31       I love how he sat down on his punches like a boxer, like shifting his weight because he's, I don't see a lot of kickboxers that do that. Well yeah, we're still here and then they rotate, rotate, but they don't, he's like really kind of getting in here, you know, like a boxer more.

Speaker 3:          00:07:48       Do you think that's because when you do dig down your, is your sort of compromising your ability to throw kicks for a brief moment because you really digging in, but he's knowing he knows when to do it too. This his fight Iq. Right.

Speaker 2:          00:08:00       It's knowing when to do it. And it's also, I s my pet peeve with we tie, look at him. My pet peeve with [inaudible] is when they throw punches, they kind of come up. It's like a very triumphant looking isn't it? It's like, and it's like that doesn't make any fucking sense cause you won't punch with power, not the same power. Um, and you can't get out of the way. Why do you think they do? I didn't think that. I just think they weren't taught well. I wasn't, I just recently started changing my style. You know, but um, when you kick you're up, you kinda come up into the kick, you know, like raise up and then they try to punch in that way. And I really feel like just with mixed martial arts, when you are doing wrestling, you have to like be respectful that you're doing MMA fight, but kind of embody that, you know, that wrestling technique when you're punching, you got to embody that punching technique when you're kicking, you got to embody that kicking technique.

Speaker 2:          00:08:56       And same with Jujitsu. Like you wouldn't stand as a Muy Thai fighter if you're doing a wrestling move right in an MMA fight, of course. And I think with Moyie high fighters, they don't understand that. It's like when you're punching, you're like kind of sit down and rotate. You got a hotel. I like to say, Oh take [inaudible] I have good hotel. And then when the kick, they got to come up when they need, they got to come up. You know, it's different and they don't make that distinction. And then they don't produce, they don't optimize on their body and the power that they could produce.

Speaker 3:          00:09:24       That's always been a big issue with, with MMA is fighters trying to figure out exactly how to position themselves and how to move and then all the variables, right. The how many different ways there are to do it really successfully. Like UCL, Conor McGregor stands wide stance kind of sideways. He stands almost like, like a karate guy a lot around his, his strong weapons. Yeah. Yeah. Whereas different guys have, you know, different ways of doing like, you know, Daniel Cormier, a very different style. No hands up, high moves forward, you know, a lot of Bob and weave in as much more like a totally,

Speaker 2:          00:09:57       you gonna fuck if you get hit, you get your handle on him though. No. Or Connor does. Right. I kind of take it, can you stay away from exactly. Exactly. This is more like, come at me, bitch grabbed me, but I'm going to come and get ya. Yeah, exactly. Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:10:14       Uh, but it's uh, it's fascinating also how a lot of people that come from certain backgrounds, like even wrestlers who come from a wrestling background, they have to alter their own wrestling style for MMA. Like a lot of wrestlers, specifically guys who stand in an Orthodox position position when they're boxing. But if there were a right handed wrestler, a lot of times they'd be standing, so yeah. And they'd be shooting with the right leg forward. Uh Huh. Uh Huh. So it's a lot of judo to yeah. Right. Yeah. Yeah. It's a lot of weird, like MMA is such a different thing. It's so different. There's so like it's where all the pieces come together and some of them don't line up that good.

Speaker 2:          00:10:53       Yeah. Yeah. I think the best people are the ones that can make it line up. Sure. Yeah. And that's at the most fluidity

Speaker 3:          00:11:01       when you see, um, particularly you because you're a world champion Muay Thai fighter and when you see the level of standup in MMA, for sure. Now with women, it's the highest it's ever been right. Like right around now. But it's still not quite the level that you would see in like championship Moitai except for girls like Valentina. Yeah. She's amazing. Yeah. Cyborg of course is very scary.

Speaker 2:          00:11:26       Yeah, she is. She's so nice. Super Nice. Right. This pulled out. Sorry. That's all right. That's fair. Yeah. You can move it around. Yep. There we go. There you go. All right. Yeah. Um, yeah. Have you met her? You'd be like, really? I feel bad for making fun of her. She made fun of her before. Yeah. She's so nice. She's, I'm just got to be like this really a tender soul or heart. Yeah. Which is funny because it seems genuine, very genuine,

Speaker 3:          00:11:54       very, very genuine. And she's matching people. It's like, yeah, well that's genuine to, Yup.

Speaker 2:          00:11:59       Yeah. It's like, so whatever it is, it's 100% and that's, and there's something a really, um,

Speaker 3:          00:12:05       rare and, and then, uh, so powerful because people aren't 100% right. You know, there aren't 100%, like fully, like, just heartbroken, wide open, um, um, soft and then they're not 100%, you know, violence. Right. And she's just like 100% so cool about her. Yeah. Yeah. That's interesting. Right? Like when she fights, she's 100% [inaudible] violence. Yeah. And that is, that's, that's something that you see in a lot of lot of champions. It's like there's a, there's an ability like there's an ability to be like a really nice person and then a terrible person or I'm not even a terrible person. A furious competitor. Yeah. You know? Yeah. When you first started fighting, did you just find that inside of you? Did, you know it was always there, like that's you ha cause you're, you're a person that I, if I had to like if I had explained you like you're like very energetic and fun loving, you're very nice person skipping around your studio util fun.

Speaker 3:          00:13:08       Like you're a fun person hearing when we probably met in like, I want to say it was 2003 it was the bomb squad days. I was about 28 yeah. Bam. 42 the dizzy. Yeah. Right. Yeah, yeah, yeah. But you've always been like that. But then when I've seen you fight, like this is a different Miriam, Miriam, when Miriam comes to fight, it's like, oh, she got a little switch in there and you hit a switch and then you become a different person and then it's not just that you're a competitor, you're, you become super hyper focused and aware and ruthlessly aggressive. Yeah. Yeah. I, um, did you know that was always in you before you fought? Who is new? That I, I would always have a trouble with girlfriends and I mean like dating, I mean like try to have a girl that's a friend when I was younger because I would hurt them. You've heard them physically? Yeah. Accidentally. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:14:10       It was wrestling around with this one woman all like, yeah, we're going to be friends. We're like the same height and we're wrestling around and playing around. If we were like partying in Vegas and I were wrestling and I've wrapped my legs around her rib cage and squeeze and cracked something in there. Oh, where were you? You were on the ground. It's like utopia. And then we went to this after party afterwards. And you were dressed like in my twenties drunk or whatever, you know, or whatever or whatever. And uh, he was, my size is like, you know, she wanted to wrestle too, so I was like, oh, can't wrestle too. And yet cracked something in there. Yeah. She didn't want to be my friend anymore. She was mad at you? Yeah. It was really sad. Oh yeah. Well you probably off light.

Speaker 1:          00:14:52       Anybody gets upset that, you know, it's not like you meant to hurt her. No. But Ivy prep, why the fuck that is a weird thing that people do, right? I mean, I've seen guys do it and girls do it where they start play wrestling, but they have no fucking idea what they're doing. And then, and then they hurt themselves and they bite off more than they could chew. Well, that's a common thing. For whatever reason. People get a little drunk or whatever and then they want to wrestle. So what I used to do is I used to let people play around with me and then I end up getting stabbed in the eyes or with fingers. Oh yeah. So now I don't, I'm like, all right, cool. That's the number one draw with you anymore. MMA for sure. They'll fucking, I fucking hate it. There's so many guys like look at my Michael Bisping.

Speaker 1:          00:15:39       He has one eye that's like completely fucked up though. He's got oil in his eye. They should um, penalize more higher for that. 100%. Yeah, I think that, um, that would the behavior with disc decrease or think so too. I think one point, I think one point for a nut shot and one point for an Ebook, just period. You didn't mean to do it. That's great. But you did it. So for the second not shot, no first note shot first not shot first. I poke my, because I don't have nuts, so I'm a little bit more lenient on that one. I'm like, oh well whatever. Well, Brian Foster is a dude who fought for the UFC back in the day. He lost it. Nut. So funny. Oh, dairy. I knew somebody. Okay. So now we're reminded me of this guy that was at the old fair techs.

Speaker 1:          00:16:28       Clemon Tina when Backlund Alex Khan was there and he, so the rumor had it that he had one ball and yeah. And he was kind of grumpy and sorta like insecure and yeah, I guess so. So this I just thought of him and it just made me laugh. So it's not just what the hell's in general? No, but that would be really, that would be super painful to lose one of those. Apparently what happened was ruptures. He was sparring and like, like one last round decided not to wear his cup and went out there and slam. Whoa. God took on right on the sac and burst that he's still fighting. I saw him, uh, on uh, uh, smaller, uh, one of those, you know, like a access TV fights recently to me, like a breast implant is ruptured. Oh there's so much. It's all over the place. A little breast implant helps you through your system. It would be like if a breast implant helped you be a woman, cause that's like the sac that produces your testosterone, this stupid design. Well another buddy of mine lost one to cancer. Oh, just impregnated is lady [inaudible] still works. Yay. You'll Duncan to Dunkin.

Speaker 1:          00:17:42       But um, we're talking about getting kicked in the balls. Oh yeah. One point. Just one point for Ipos. One point for ball shots. Just take a point away every time. I think that would be giant. I think that's fair. I would, it would fucking hell so many people doing this. The thing is we're good. I poke, we'll change the change, the change, the fight 100% it can, it can sway the fight one way or the other. Yeah. You know, so I, I don't, I, that's, and people that they've gotten poked in the eye, the reflexive continue and then they get fucked up and then they lose a fight that they were winning. Exactly. Yeah. That's terrible. Terrible. It's a huge swing. I think one point absolutely. And I think there should be a better way to determine whether or not a guy's eyes had been compromised by that Ipos.

Speaker 1:          00:18:28       And sometimes it's not within the, I mean everybody wants to see the fight continue, but if you really had to think about it, like if this guy really can only see out of one eye, it's not right. Yeah. Yeah. Especially when it wasn't their fault, but it's also such a fucking shit design. All your fingers are just out there. Maybe they should just curve them more. Yeah, like the same design just curved. They automate it. Like when you have a good hand wrap, like when they wrap your hands for the fight. When it's a good one, they just sit like this, like your hands just sit there. So they're just already ready to, you know, it's perfect. Well there's someone that I know that's working closely with the UFC that's working on new design, but I think it's going to be okay. But still the fingers are exposed.

Speaker 1:          00:19:05       I think almost like the fingers should be covered and how are they going to careers. But I think he covered it like a bad glove. You know how bad gloves, like those old school Everlast God gloves be amazing for me. Yeah. For a grappler. I don't think they'd like that. You'd be good for grappler too. If I had to ground mat gloves on, I don't think I'd have a problem with it. The weirder I grab the maybe you know like a wrestler and then, I don't know. I think the real, I think he'd give you more traction. Honestly. The real problem is the pad on the knuckle. Like when you're going behind the neck where you're choking behind that, it's very hard to get that fucker behind the neck. Nothing's off that path. It is. It's hard. I've grappled with, you know, I've never had an MMA fight, but I had grappled quite a bit with with gloves.

Speaker 1:          00:19:49       What do these, does this aspiring grappling gloves and, yeah. Yeah. Those are just like, um, those are just a little bit more padding, but those, yeah, that's a little bit better. Pride gloves were better. Honestly. Quite honestly, cried gloves really had much more curve to them and there was very few. I pokes in pride. I won't even fuck with a boxing glove. That doesn't curve like it doesn't like if I have to make a fist inside the glove, I'm not going to deal with that. That's good. See this is like someone had observed this a long time ago that look at the UFC gloves on the right and the pride gloves in the left. The prod glove is your hands curve the way better? It's way better glove. Yeah and the back of your hand is like padded in a weird spot. I don't know why they pad right here.

Speaker 1:          00:20:36       Like right above the wrist scope would make that like right there. The one that one though. If you did a spinning back fist hit, there's a little bones. Yeah, right. They do break. But most of the time you're doing that. You're hardly ever doing it like a back fist are kind of doing it like a hammer fist and then the real thing is happening with a lot of fighters. Is there a hit and foreheads? Snapping arms? Paul felt that if you hit me with, I'll be, I'll fucking, you get mad. I get so mad. And why do you get rid of the bullshit bullshit, bullshit move, which is the bullshit. Some people have moves that they feel are bullshit moves like offended. Like if somebody asks kicked you that I don't care. That wouldn't be bullshit. They pushed, kicked me in the face and I wouldn't care.

Speaker 1:          00:21:23       I'd be like, all right, but it spinning back bullshit. But it's so good. It's such a good technique. Some fucking corn ball about that. Okay. What about spinning elbows though? Yeah, those are awesome and I'm not great at them, but that doesn't make any sense. I know I contradict myself to excellence, right? Yeah, it is weird, right? Yeah. Well I mean I think they should allow spinning back fist and boxing. I'm like interesting how everybody would be so cocky. You know. So many guys. They're sad. The boxing fans would be, how many guys would get flatlined? How many guys who don't know what the fuck to do about it? You're standing plan superman punches. Well, superman punches. I think our legal right. They react the same way, right? No one would think you throwing a leg kick. Why is, why is mine cause cause you have all these hair. I'm bald as fuck. Oh there we go. There you go.

Speaker 1:          00:22:26       That's better. Okay. Um, yeah, but why can't they spinning back fist in boxing? I don't know. Should be able to, they are very purist, but I see where they're coming from in a certain way. Like when boxers talk shit about MMA and striking in MMA, I see where they're coming from the wrong because your shit won't work. Like come try that shit. You're going to get taken down stupid. Like this is the whole reason why they do it a different way. But I actually do believe that a boxer with incredible footwork and a jab, a great job could survive and win in an MMA fight as long as he doesn't fight a long guy with good kicks, like a Jon Jones, Jon Jones just kicked the shit out of you from a distance. You're not even going to get close to him. And then by the time you've eaten all those leg kicks, you're not moving so good.

Speaker 1:          00:23:17       Yeah. And Smash your face. I agree. Yeah. But yeah, I think, I think footwork is key. Do you remember when Vince Foster, when he was a shit, not quite world class anymore. He'd lost a title and this is what worries me because I don't remember shit. You don't remember shit? Well, he fought Masato, but when Masato was the king of k one over Japan, Masato the sexiest Japanese man I've ever seen. Pretty sexy. Yeah. He's super lazy. Sexy isn't sexy. Yama, I dunno know sexy yama is what you don't know. Sexy, sexy on fought in the UFC several times. Fought in pride. Yeah. I don't know who that is. That's a great name now. A gorgeous, gorgeous man. Feel like that should be a super Sushi roll areas. There's sexy yama autos. Way better looking. Yeah. You say that you're not succeed, yamas presence. Look at that. I like the way glows. Yeah, look at them. I mean it was beautiful, but those pecs, yeah, he's got that cross dangle and super low. What's going on with that? You look that cro, it's almost like a belly button ring or some shit. That's a deal breaker, right? A dude with a belly button ring. How about that? A guy or a gorgeous guy with a belly button ring. He's freaky. Is that what it means? He vein or gay as fuck. More likely.

Speaker 1:          00:24:34       That's something men just never rubbing. It means he's freaky or he takes too many cell face. Yeah, it definitely does. She either. So yeah, that's something any man's ever bravely tried to rock my note. Guys Do. Nipple rings, like a real freaky dude. We're doing it once you've seen it. A belly button ring on a male. One time I saw a pierced. Who's that? Masato there it beautiful. I thought you were showing me a belly button ring. There's better pictures of him. There is better. He's really good looking.

Speaker 3:          00:25:01       Very handsome and still is and you know, and and still, you know, is very active and all sorts of uh,

Speaker 1:          00:25:08       promotions and stuff. Japan, when he fought no, when he was gonna Fight Petrosian and portrays you and was killing sour. And what happened? It was supposed to be his like, uh, there's one song. Goodbye. Yeah. Yeah. And so he's watching Petrosian Dis, I think it was sour. Destroy any sour and, and, uh, he's just like, fuck, he's like, pull up

Speaker 3:          00:25:34       Masako versus, um, Vince Philips. Because what was interesting about this, it was a, it was like, do you remember when I'm Shannon the cannon, um, decided to fight in k one and he fought, uh, Tom Erickson and a kickboxing match. No, you don't remember, but that was a similar thing, but Tom Erickson was not, you know, Tom Erickson was a wrestler who's an MMA fighter and a Shannon Briggs eight, a couple of leg kicks and it was talking about it on the podcast like that. He was trying to play it off. It was like, God damn, that shit hurt. But, uh, he wound up Kaylyn, Tom Erickson, but Tom Erickson at the time was not nearly the kind of Stryker that Vince Phillips was when Vince Phillips Swap Masato. Vince Phillips had beaten worldclass fighters, I think. Who did he beat? He beat some fucking high level worldclass boxers. And then, you know, we got like 36, 37 38 and then took this fight was 37 at the time.

Speaker 4:          00:26:30       Uh, I don't know.

Speaker 3:          00:26:32       So he fought Vince Phillips, but it was so weird seeing a Vince Phillips walk out there barefoot. I mean they should have let him wear boxing shoes cause he's not thrown into kicks. Yeah. And Masato just

Speaker 1:          00:26:44       gimme gimme some fit. Beautiful Man. Perfect bone structure. He's ridiculous. Perfect hair to English. And Vince Phillips was like, what the fuck did I sign up for? Yeah, that feeling that they have when they're at the shoulder about to get leg kicked. So right away you opens up inside and just moves away from the punches. Sets goes up high. It goes up high punched times kicking into the arms and that goes across the leg. See that's a, that's a weird one right there across the thigh. Not Shot, but this was, this is at the time, like one of the first times that a, a real world class boxer had attempted a kickboxing fight and know that's um, friends both. It did that too. Do you remember frowns both up? He was a heavyweight contender and boxing in the eighties and nineties to watching fights. If you talked to my wife and ask her what she told me about 10 minutes ago, I will not remember what the fuck she said was a lot of shit that I don't remember.

Speaker 1:          00:27:58       But I have like storage units in my brain and stuff like, oh, that's interesting. What happened there? This happened. Oh, why did that happen? Why did this go wrong? Oh, okay. Pull up a Georgia Petrosian versus um, uh, Andy Sour as a u e r does it know, how's it highspot Oh, here's friends both. Yeah. So you, so friends both. This is France both at fat as fuck too. He had like, he had hit the wall. He was the white buffalo. He's a South African heavyweight, but he, uh, he actually learned how to kick a little bit and he was not just boxing guys, but his, his hands were just way better than most boxers are. Most kickboxers rather cause he was at one point in time, a real heavyweight contender. This is not a good example then, which was 2015. Holy Shit Dude, that this is 2000. This guy was a fucking contender in the 90s he's already hurt. Yeah. This is, she had thrown a knee. Did you watch the chocolate Dell fight? I just the end of it. Yeah. Not Good. Right? How old is he now? 50 yeah, so there's hope for me.

Speaker 1:          00:29:12       Well, you've never been knocked out the way he's, he's been knocked out so many times. I don't think I've ever been knocked out. Not In the gym. Not ever flash, flash knockdown. That's it. Yeah. I've had concussions and been knocked out from like falling and the rain falling off a second floor landing when I was a kid, but in fighting and ever [inaudible] trucks also, I think there was an issue with his style because his style was so aggressive, aggressive that people could just set, set, set, boom and counter like Rashad Evans did with him. And so you're getting his momentum coming forward and the shy and we get flat line. It doesn't change. No he doesn't. No. He had a style that was incredibly effective back in the day. I think he became married to that. That approach. You know, the approach that works so well on Bob Ballou so well on Tito in the early fights, he was just a marauder.

Speaker 1:          00:30:11       You could hit him in the face with a fucking crow bar and he would just spit metal out at you. You didn't give a fuck. He was so bad ass back in the day. He relied on that so much. I remember all the no hawks. Yeah. Everybody, a little kid to wear Mohawks back in the day. People will get in Japanese symbols tattooed on their head because of him. Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's just that, that style, there's a comes a certain point in time and you just can't do that anymore. You know, I think, um, I dunno, like it's a martial artist, you know, artists evolve and they're like, oh, well let me try this new paint. Oh, let me try this, this, this a new technique. Let me try this shading. Let me, you know, start sculpting. Let me try. And I think with, uh, especially MMA, you know, there's just so much opportunity to evolve and just add new, new, new nuances to you as an artist.

Speaker 1:          00:31:09       I mean, I think that's what I love about it. There's certainly is, but one thing that does happen when, when God's try to add a lot of things, like say sometimes they'll try to like say a wrestler will add a bunch of things to his repertoire, but then they stopped with the wrestling. Wrestling is not as sharp and so then when they go up against a really good wrestler, they falter and then they're, they don't have what brought them to the dance in the first place. But I think that's just looking at your opponent and what's in front of you. And also like being honest with yourself. And like I think right now I'm looking at getting back into fighting and if I didn't feel the sharpness, I didn't, I didn't feel the fire and not just the fire. If I didn't physically feel the sharpness, if I didn't feel the reflexes, I'd have to be honest with myself and say, okay, don't do this.

Speaker 1:          00:31:57       Do you think that you would oh 100% be capable of being rational and objective about what you can do right now? Yeah, yeah. Because I don't, I don't fight for participation awards. You know what I mean? Like I'm not like, Hey, I'm a, but there's some UFC fighters are like, I'm a UFC fighter. Yay. I've made it. Like that's not really making it. You're just another, you know, like say I'm a world champion, I'm a the best in the world. Emma, that's like I'm a UFC fighter is like a participation medal basically like level. It shows that you're a very high level fighter. You're very right. But you and your eyes, you as a champion, that is what's important. You want to be the queen.

Speaker 3:          00:32:40       You want to be a top of the hill to the best of your best self. Yes. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Um, uh, this one thing that I really like about individual sports, whether it's Jujitsu or Moy, tai or any or boxing, is that you can focus on just one sport and all the various aspects of one sport. And there's so much subtlety in so much technique and so much to learn. I mean you were what? Watch Floyd Mayweather senior train people. It's really interesting because he's showing guys who are world class fighters, like the subtle subtle aspects of boxing and movement and things they're doing wrong. He, you know, Simon Marcus, he was working with Simon Marcus and he was doing some training with sidewalks. I'm like, this is so fast and had to be hired for a guy like Simon. Yeah. Cause he's a very rigid yes. And he's, he gets so much power from his rigidity and so like boxing is much more, it's not rigid.

Speaker 3:          00:33:36       Right. You know, it's like hip hop. We know that it's got that, like that beat to it and that like swag to it. And Simon Marcus is just so that Moy Thai style and a lot of grappling moving forward. Yeah. He's a very physically strong guy too. Yeah. He looks like he's on Shit. Yeah, he does. Hey good. Janine's jeans. I remember Joe Schilling. Yes I is. Yes. Is that beef? Fuck yeah, that fourth. I can't remember what a fucking crazy fight that was. I was there for that. And it was all the controversy on the first one. Right. Cause it wasn't that there was the illegal, was it illegal? He hooked the back of the heel or something. And then on the, on the throat, on the, yeah, he, this was the first fights. So the first one at first fight Simon Marcus one, but it was like a knot.

Speaker 3:          00:34:30       He got knocked out. Right. So did from he, uh, when Simon fell on him and he also put his, he foot behind his heel. Right. I guess. And there was a lot of conscious about that, whether that was legal or not. And then when he fell on him, I guess he hit Joe in the head, in the jaw with his, his forehead or something. And so Joe got up like this. Did you remember that? Yes, I do now. Yeah. Yeah. So the revenge that avid in that last man standing tournament, which was a fucking crazy thing to begin with, where they were going to have to fight three times in a night. Yeah. Yeah. So, uh, they fought in the first round. Joe Fought Simon and it went three rounds and it was a draw. And so in the fourth round they had to come out. Both guys were like, holy, you know, Gloria goes one more round.

Speaker 3:          00:35:20       There's like fuck. And Simon Marcus had kept spitting out his mouthpiece and big John McCarthy took a point away. He goes, he takes a point away from Simon because Simon was exhausted as they were going to war for three pl. Absolutely. Yeah, absolutely. He was spitting on his mouthpiece, peck, trying to gain some time. Now he's pretty fucking Jack, Jack. And so now he's got one point down going into a fight. That's a draw. So he's got to move forward. So he comes after Joe and Joe knows he's got to come at him. So Joe starts countering and he catches him with this fucking nasty right hook. I think it's coming soon. Right here. Three or four seconds. Well it was a wild fight. Just a wild series of exchanges and I think Simon, yeah, here it is. Simon's moving forward. Boom. There it is. And Simon had knocked Joe down early in the fight. I think he knocked Joe down in the first, so he, so Joe lost the first round and then we'll probably one the second and third. So it was a tie going into the fourth.

Speaker 2:          00:36:26       Wow. Yeah, it was a crazy fight. Awesome fight. Doe. They actually fought in lion fight too. I've, I've, if I, I've had a lot of concussions could be wrong, but I thought it was the plot

Speaker 3:          00:36:39       controversy. Yeah. And then the second fight was in line fight and it was winner take all the purse and then I think it was glory. Mm. Yeah. I think you're right. Yeah, that's, that was round to get knocked down. Yeah. Yeah. I, I loved lion fight. I wish they'd kept it on access TV. I don't know what the fuck happened. I don't know where it is now. I think it's like on a web app or some shit. I was afraid to fight line fight because of the judging really screwy decision. It was just like, but it's not an athletic commission thing. That seems more ago. Athletic Commission thing than a lion fight. It doesn't matter because whatever, if they keep doing it in the same spot so it doesn't matter. So say the case with Vegas though. I mean Vegas has some terrible fucking judging sometimes.

Speaker 3:          00:37:21       Yeah, and it's not, I mean, I don't know how you fix that other than fire. Anyone who has any shitty decisions and it seems like you can't even, you can you petition, you can, but nobody wins. See, that's fucked up. It is fucked up. I can't imagine when has anyone in your recent memory or in your memory period when is anyone appealed a decision and one I've never, I've never heard of it. [inaudible] that's crazy. You think about all the fights that we've seen and that we've never, we don't, we can't even recall someone who got fucked who went back and reviewed the tape. Look, I, I'm hitting him three to one, two to one and it still lose decision which has happened. Yeah, that has happened. There's been some agregious horrible decisions

Speaker 2:          00:38:06       at, I hate about this is I think that these, the judges don't really think about that. It's our lives. I think if, if I have this loss because of your era, the next time I fight I make less money and I'm already not making that much money. Like you're not even thinking about how, how, what this does to me as, as an, as a fighter, you know? Yeah. It doesn't, um, I don't think that it's, they're not thinking about, I think

Speaker 1:          00:38:36       it's, they're not competent. I think when there, I think there's certainly corruption and there's certainly people that get bribed. I guarantee that does still probably happen. How do I guarantee? Probably I can't write, but I think more likely than that is you're seeing incompetence. I think you're seeing people that don't have any martial arts training.

Speaker 2:          00:38:57       That's fucked up though. Then that it's ego. Like I can admit that they don't know, oh my God, I had that job. I fucking had that at a, I was a WBC title defense and I'm doing completely legal throws it, I'm way high throws and he's telling me no more slamming her on the canvas. He's like, he says this ain't no Jujitsu. No. Literally People's, yeah. Oh yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:39:26       I said his name as Voldemort. Oh my goodness. Tom, you have a, your wins commission appeal retains to FC champion. Wait a minute. What is the commission appeal though? What does that mean though? That might be lost a submission and the other person was a champion for 13 days. She lost by submission, Huh? Yeah. This was in at the end of 25th. 2016. How has it overturned to a no contest? I had that. So what did, what happened? I googled your question and someone found some examples of it happening and this was one of the three I found. Oh Huh. That's a little different cause that seems like there was an error in the officiating. And so if, if she lost by submission and then they said it wasn't, it wasn't legit. I had a decision overturned. Did you really? It was a fuck. What's his name? John. Bigger. The big rough. Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:40:27       What's the name of John Big? John McCarthy. John McCarthy. John Bigger. It's a thing that they got the name John. Um, but I need a down deponent in the head. Oh. But from where I was, I didn't realize that. So I need her once and she was like this. I was like, Oh man, let me make sure this is over with and I need her again. But she was like five [inaudible] 11, six feet ish, just among Duke super, super long. And I didn't realize that she was hired or knees or on the canvas. I didn't know Justin Duke fought Moy. Tai? No, this was an MMA. Oh, I knocked her out, but, and then I put one for good measure. Oh, unfortunately, unfortunately he gave me the win and then she appealed. She uh, yeah, appealed it and then it got overturned to a no contest. It's not a DQ cause I mean I didn't realize. Right, right. That's interesting. Hm. Yeah. Cause she would gone out anyway. Yeah. So I, I've kind of fucked myself. I gave her a leg to stand on.

Speaker 1:          00:41:25       Yeah. Hmm. Yeah. That was, that was like, what organization was that in? INVICTA. Mm. How many fights do you have in Invicta? Oh, three. Three I think. How many is that all the most MMA fights you bad. Oh God. Three right? Four. Four, I think four. Now, when you talk about coming back now, and I know, you know you're recovering from knee injuries and all this jazz, what are you thinking of? Chunkiness he looked great now. Yeah. It's so much better because of snacking, Modo, no Nakamoto, healthy snacks. It man, when you're 40 pounds overweight, you smelled different. Do you know, like not, not yourself. It's not yourself. This is not 40 pounds. A lot is a lot. What were you eating or not eating or drinking all the time. Oh, you're not working out and like limping. Cause my name is cell. Fuck yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:42:16       This is a lot of a lot of grief. Yeah. But um, for someone like you, it's gotta be hard to, because you're so connected to like your physical activity. So to have that removed and taken away from you, well that was a mirror where you're talking about like finding out who you really are, who you think you are getting that injuring, gaining all that weight. I was like, oh, okay. Who I think I am. I no longer have access to that. So now who am I? You know? And it was like spent the last five years trying to work that shit out. So yeah, that happens. A lot of fighters when they retire. Yeah. Okay. I think I have it already.

Speaker 1:          00:42:57       What were you thinking? Well, that time was up because you've got to feel like also you're 42 now, so this is all happening at 37 which is, you know, for some fighters it's towards the end anyway. Yeah, no, I was doing well at 37 I was doing fine. No, you're doing great. But there's a reality of the clock. Yeah, for sure. When you look at at least historically, everyone outside of Bernard Hopkins, he's amazing. Fucking amazing. Holy Shit. 46 years old fighting world class. I mean, I think he beat, did he beat Kelly Pavlik when he was like 46 I think he box Kelly Pavlik up when he was 46 and lost to Joe Smith. I think he was 51 but by the time we got knocked out and sent out of the cage or out of the ring. Oh, that guy. Yeah, I know. He's amazing. Amazing. 43 when he fucking pablet he's like more conservative now.

Speaker 1:          00:43:45       Yes. When he fights. Well he's done. But yeah. Well he's a just recent stuff. A masterful boxer just absolutely understands everything about boxing and he's not going to put himself in a position where he's going to get fucked up until he couldn't help it anymore. Like the Joe Smith fight. It was like this has gotta be, this is going to have yet and left too. It felt like cove was lighten them up also like, oh I don't want to watch this. You know, it hurts when you see somebody so incredible when they're, you know, when it's done. Yes. Cause they just, yeah. Yeah. I actually think you're so much better than this. It's especially like when they're an artist. Like there's something about when you see chuck go out on a shield, something about it to me, I don't seeing it for sure.

Speaker 3:          00:44:32       I definitely would have liked it if he didn't get knocked out again. But one thing that I would, I would like young fighters to see is that this is, there's consequences to choices in terms of like how you approach these exchanges and how you, how you fight and then I'm, I'm of a belief that you should fight the correct way. Don't fight the way that pleases your boss or the crowd fight the way you, the way you're supposed to with your skills. Like yeah, and win by knockout when you can, but don't get knocked out because you're trying to win by knockout and doing something that you're overextending yourself and exposing yourself and you're compromising yourself. Like that's not wise. And I think part of fighting has to be wise. It's exciting enough. I mean it's fucking crazy and wild enough but everybody wants every single second of it to be filled with blood and the crowd cheering and when they're not, I mean how many times have we seen fights where just there's a lull in the action for a brief moment or they're clinching and people start booing and then someone caught mix it up.

Speaker 3:          00:45:33       Boys mix it up. Like, what do you mean mix it up? The fuck are you do, what do you think they're doing, man? They're fighting. This is crazy talk, you know, like you see it all the time. Social media brain, this is a little bit of that patient. What everybody wants to be a huge star two, you know, everybody wants to do their best to gain the most followers and get the most love and gets the most applause. You know, there's a right way to fight in a wrong way to fight. And one of the things about watching guy like chuck go out on a shield like that. It's like this is the bed he made. I mean, this is his style. His style is Marauder Berzerker move forward. Like Melvin Manhoef. When you see Melvin go out on his shield, you go, look, this is Melvin style. Yeah, yeah, that's true. But if you see a guy like sugar ray Leonard and he gets Kao, do you like, oh Jesus, like stop. You can't do it anymore. Yeah, you're not really, you can't, you can't move the way that made you successful. Pernell Whitaker or something like that. If you see them for, for whatever reason, they can't move. Right. Do you remember Pernell Whitaker? I know the name, but I haven't watched

Speaker 2:          00:46:39       hi damn woman as I was just letting, I'm like man, he was a defensive genius. Olympic gold medalist, 76 I'm, I'm terrible. So people ask me, they will ask me about the why crew, Rob Mccoy and I'm just like, I dunno, it's both. Or they'll ask me, how do you win a Moitai fight? And I go, I don't know, do more damage. Like I don't fucking know what scores higher elbow or knee or punch. I don't know. It just fucking win. Right? Like I have no idea where you ever thinking what scores higher. Just thinking I'm going to dominate this motherfucker. This is my space. Yeah. Like this is my, you know, yeah. It's square a circle or what is that? How You thinking about it? This is mine. Well, yeah, cause I think you, you, you dominate the space and like it's about territory, you know, and findings territory and you start and it's even, and they have to their side and you have your side and you take the territory away and you want them to feel like it's not, there is space anymore. Like that's how you impose your will. You know what I mean? Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:47:49       It's as simple. I Dunno, I dunno about fucking points and this and that and it's shit. Do you have no idea? Do you ever teach? Uh, yeah. Do you teach private lessons? Do you teach classes? Like what do you teach? A little bit. Yeah. Yeah. Do you ever work with fighters? Um, I have. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. When you do it, do you find that looking at it in a way we were trying to explain it to someone who's also trying to do what you do, that it helps you understand what you do? Um, yeah. Yeah. But I definitely don't. You don't like it?

Speaker 2:          00:48:26       No, no. I, I, I still like this conversation is the same. Like it's more about like the tone you're setting rather than the weapons you're using. [inaudible] to me because it, it's, it's really just like there's that space and it's your job to own it. [inaudible] you know, like you own the center of the ring. You, you dictate where they go. You take things away, you know? It's like a, it's an ex convict trying to get a job. The doors just shut in their face shut in their face. Everywhere they turn shut in their face shut in their face. And interesting way to look like that's how you want to make them feel like you're approach. I don't, I don't want to, I don't want an x comic to not be able to get a job right in the ring. You want to take shit away from somebody and make them feel very discouraged.

Speaker 1:          00:49:09       Yeah. Yeah. Like you don't belong here anymore and you know that, you know, like that's what you want them to feel. Yeah. Yeah. And you don't want to fight me again. That's another thing. You want to make the field do, you know, like this is these things. So you've got to understand what you're doing there. But insofar as like what scores higher and what did this and the, I don't fucking know, but for no fucking idea, which just goes off of like how, how my opponent is reacting to what I'm doing to them. Right. How they're reacting to me and that's what I'm going to throw or where they move and that's what I'm going to throw. I don't think about like, oh, is this going to score? Should I throw this or this? Which will score higher. Right. You can't, I don't know. It's fucking retarded.

Speaker 1:          00:49:51       Yeah. Yeah. It's not a wise way to think, I don't think. I think especially in something like more time, which so many fights win by knockout and so many fights are won by knockout. Yeah. And it's such a, such a devastating art. You know, we think about just having the ability to kick and knee and punch and elbow and all these different weapons you using. I think we thought it doesn't hurt that much. What does that mean? What does that mean? Boy, ty doesn't hurt that much. Were talking about earlier about breaking your elbow on someone's head, but that didn't hurt at the time. At the time it didn't hurt but adrenaline. No, I mean it is like,

Speaker 2:          00:50:28       it just Bam. And I'm like, whoa, she's bleeding. It's crazy. And the refs like pulling me off her and I don't think about how it felt. I don't think about, you know, like when I got my ribs cracked from a kick and then we tie fight, I thought it was liver, so I was like, I feel my pain. I'm like, no. And then I'm like, fuck you. I'm in the fight and you pull yourself back out of that pain cause you don't want to fall into the pain because it's hard to climb back up. It's like swimming up, up, um, upstream. Right. So you kind of kept falling to that fucking pain and uh, but it's, it's not, it's, I mean, it's banged up, but it's not that bad. Well, you don't have a tolerance for it. Yeah. I just like, I mean, your shins will be bruised up, you know?

Speaker 2:          00:51:10       I don't, I mean we were up on Instagram once of your legs. I know that hurt. That really hurt. What day was the week after the fight that your legs were that fucked up? No, no, no. That was right before I fought. It was right before you Vaughn? Yeah, so I had three fights and that one was about right before the last one. Oh, you're three fights in a day? No, I had three fights over five days, which made it worse actually because if the three fights I've been in one day then these, yeah, so they had a day between each and so the pain would set in and yeah, it was Ifma. Was it in Thailand? Oh, they're crazy over there. It was cool. I liked it. That's wild. But that shit hurt. That shit her for weeks. Like I couldn't roll over in bed like they couldn't, they couldn't, you know how you stack your legs and you snuggle up in your position?

Speaker 2:          00:51:57       Couldn't I had to and like put a pillow in between them? Yeah. Oh, there was the bruising was behind on the calves like it was, it was, I got kicked in the front. Yeah. But there's so much blood, you know, internal bleeding from the bruising. It went to the back to my cap. So it actually is Cirque and calculating my whole leg and bruising. And then it went down, um, my ankles, both sides and then down to my toes. So you took the pictures, that was you in between the second and third fight. That was the bright before the third fight I was waiting at, it was the king's cup that says the king's birthday. Yeah, it's, yeah. So that's, yeah. And you can see my ankle and it actually went underneath my toes. And this is before there was a fight again. Both legs were like that.

Speaker 2:          00:52:45       Both were like this and you have to fight again. Yeah. So do you know what? And Matt Johnson on, that's him rubbing me. And so he tried to give me the white tie. They give you the preflight massage with the tile in it. He couldn't fucking touch me. Is it so bad? Fuck. Did you fight like this? I don't know, but I did. That is so insane. Yeah. And their legs are so banged up, the fact that you fought. Yeah. Yeah. And it's so like mentally I was just like, wow, this is, this is, this is happening, this is, I'm going to do this. And I'd look at my legs, okay, okay, this is happening, this is, this is okay. And yeah, just started fighting. What did you feel? I don't think about that. Sometimes you get kicked in, it gets, it goes through, like it gets through here for shield, you know, like you kind of put up this like, I dunno when I fight, it's like I'm fighting and thing. Yeah. It's a four shields in a sense, you know? Um, and uh, sometimes if it hurts enough, like when I got my ribs cracked, I felt that right. I can went through and I like disrupted my force shield and so sometimes that's something we'll go through like a good solid were killed. So my four shields for, she'll activate your attitude, your mindset. This is like you're fighting, you're, you're ready to accept all sorts of things. Yeah. Like I could die

Speaker 2:          00:54:03       or even harder. I could kill someone if you think it'd be harder to kill someone than to die and so on. You. Yeah. Yeah. Because then you think about their loved ones. So looking at all the people that loved you, we fight. Think about all the people that love you. Right? Yeah. And so when we fight, I didn't, I didn't break any rules, but I killed you. Right. I think about all your loved ones. Everybody that loves you with, that's attached to you. I think about that,

Speaker 2:          00:54:34       all that pain because of what I did to you. Right. Even though I didn't break any rules. Have you ever been in a promotion where someone died but that's heavy, right? Yeah. And I don't, I think probably why a lot of fighters, I have noticed like there's, there's, I don't think the majority of fighters, um, look at what they do with the gravity that it deserves. You know, like you could kill somebody. Like you need to think about that and be okay with that. Not Okay, but just understand like, all right, that could happen and I'm going to be co a calm consciously knowing this and choosing to go forward. They just think, oh, I'm going find it. It'll be fun. It'll, you know, whatever. Or it'll be hard or I'm gonna like whatever. They don't think about these things. Is this something that you thought about when you were young?

Speaker 2:          00:55:29       Yeah, before I really got into it. So you, this is, uh, something you've been contemplating even before you started fighting, you are aware of all the possibilities? Yeah, I, okay. All right. I'll say it. So I was, um, it was about 28, I think, and I don't think I had my pro boxing debut yet. And I took some mushrooms and I was thinking somewhere along the trip I started thinking about fighting and I started thinking about like what could happen to me. And I think I started thinking about the death of me and then I started thinking about what could happen to my opponent. Like, what's worse than that? And I thought about ice could see like somebody I fight and I saw all the like, like lines of gold threat attached into them like uh, from their loved ones. And then all the got snipped when they died. Yeah. I saw this loan, this mushroom trip, and I was just like, fuck. And so then when I decided to fight, there's more intense, you know, and more commitment and more resolve. That's heavy. Yeah. Yeah. But that is what it is. Right. And that's where I think real, there's more power

Speaker 3:          00:56:47       to people that have never fought before and people that don't understand finding they did this or I don't get the appeal. I don't know why you watch it, that the reason that p one of the reasons, there's many reasons, but one of the reasons why people enjoy participating in it so much is because there's so much risk and it's so dangerous and it's so difficult, so unbelievably difficult to prepare. Unbelievably difficult to put yourself in the proper mind state, specially to be a champion, to, to beat the best of the best and to get to the top of the heap that once you do succeed, like explain that feeling to people, explain that feeling when they raise your hand and put that belt around your waist and the crowd is cheering.

Speaker 2:          00:57:32       I'm kind of weird cause I actually get depressed. You get depressed, you get depressed when you, when uh, at times, yeah. Or, or I'm just, I think for me, what I've come to realize about myself is that it's about authentic. They expressing myself in the moment. And I think with a lot of my fights, I wasn't being honest. I didn't take my heart and cut it open and pour it out on the mat or the canvas. I played it safe. I didn't go in for the knockout. I didn't slip a punch, encounter and, and get inside. I stayed outside or when I was inside I would clinch up an elbow and knee, you know? So, um, for me it hurts when I'm being inauthentic. And I know that

Speaker 2:          00:58:19       with pretty much all of my Moy Thai fights, I wasn't, but is that the case or is it you being hyper critical of yourself? Always. Always. Oh, I said, so I've, I've actually can, you just said carry it on and he can attest to this. I've, I've come out of fights and, and won the world title. It's done a great job. And I co into the gym the next week and it carried, this was stupid. I looked stupid. I didn't do this right. This is fucked up. I can't fight like that again. Like we got to fix that. And it was just like that. That's what makes a champion though. Yeah. But mine was unhealthy, so mine was more, I think, I think I'm more of a champion now than I ever was when I was actively fighting and when I was, um, I was

Speaker 4:          00:59:10       okay

Speaker 2:          00:59:10       trying to be good enough instead of just focusing on

Speaker 2:          00:59:20       how can I say, my, my, my pursuit of world titles wasn't, wasn't about it. It was a, in a defense of something that was told to me when I was growing up. So it's like I'm world champion, so you can't tell that's not true cause I'm world champion. Right. So that's what that was about for me. Making up for a lack of love, lack of appreciation or just abuse. Yeah. Lack of like, I'm not good enough. So I'm gonna win this world title and prove that I am good enough. So FSU and that's not a pure place to express yourself from, you know, like now, um, I'm more of a martial artist than I've ever been and I'm more of a teacher and a student than I've ever been in a more of a champion than I've ever been. How are you more of a champion than you've ever been? It's the way of my outlook and the way, uh, learn the way I attack new information, the way how malleable I am. Um, how

Speaker 2:          01:00:23       quickly I take things on, you know, how driven, you know, it's easy to be, it's a lot easier to be champion when you have the six pack and the muscles and the youth. And the everything, the back that up. But when you have those things taken away from you, then what is the champion? What does it without those things, it's your hearts, your desire, it's your resolve. It's your mind. We're using this expression champion. Like what, what, why, why champion? Because you're, if you're a champion, you're competing against someone to become a champion. That was a big event chance, right?

Speaker 2:          01:01:01       So to do it better, to learn it faster. Yeah. Over the things that you feel held you back and limited your potential when you actually were a world champion. Kickboxer and so now it's more about self expression. You're more balanced person. Yeah, definitely. And now it's the pursuit of self expression and as the pursuit of authenticity, um, and like finding that moment to ride the razor's edge instead of playing it safe and staying outside but not having a satisfying fight. You know, even though you won don having satisfying fights because you could feel the flaws. Yeah. Well, I could just feel how I was holding back. And it's like you can feel when you're in the zone and you go for it, 100% commitment and you, you're just in it, you know, you're in, it would fights, have you had where you really felt satisfied? Uh,

Speaker 2:          01:01:56       I would say the fight after I thought Julie. Yeah, she was, I went up kitchen. Yeah. I went up and wait to fight her. She, she um, I went up to one 40. It was champion a champion. She had 58 fights, I think. 14 world titles. I had 14 fights at the time and six world titles I think. And um, that's pretty crazy. 14 five, six world titles. Yeah. Yeah. Karen said that you were the most talented person he's ever worked with. I would agree. I would. I would because it's so high praise. What I noticed is, I mean, that's really, it's amazing stuff. Well, I'm malleable and I'm really dry lake. I'm like, no, that's not right. Do it again. This doesn't feel right. Do it again. What am I, what are you doing? What am I doing? What does it look like? What should it feel like?

Speaker 2:          01:02:48       Where's my pressure? Where's the leverage? Was this, you know, like, I'm like, I'm like that, you know? No, it's not right. Let's do it again. Oh, that was perfect. But let's move on to the next thing. And this sort of level of dissatisfaction. When you performances though, don't you think that that's ultimately what makes you such a champion in the first place? Like you, Alexander Gustafson put it best once when he was talking about one of his training camps, he's like, this is the life of a professional athlete. You're just never satisfied. He says, if you achieve, if you want to achieve greatness, you're never satisfied. No, I agree, but not with the way I was doing it. So you were doing it, but you were doing it and I'm manic, almost unhealthy way. Like I could never just give myself that. I never like, all right, that was great.

Speaker 2:          01:03:32       This needs adjustments. All right, so here's the game plan. You know, like, Oh, here, you know, you did this, this is an accomplishment. Uh, or you know, you, you conquered this, you took on this new scale. All right, let's give yourself that credit. Right. It's never good enough. Never good enough. Never good enough. Never good enough. You'll like, is that thought like you'd never good enough. Never good enough. Definitely fuel. It is right, but it's not, there's, there's much more environmentally friendly feel like this is like con pollutants pollutant and as far as your life goes, yeah, I know what you mean. Yeah. Now, so, um, I am working with, I am back at CSA, working with Korean, you know, but I told him, um, for, from Moitai I actually told Dave and Kurian this. I did well, I guess I'm telling him no, if I were having a Thai fight, obviously I'm not going to, you know, I would, I wouldn't be with anybody else.

Speaker 2:          01:04:35       Like he's, that's where the success has been. That's where the formula works. I'm not going to change that. But, um, now I'm also over at a gorilla Jujitsu. Wait, Dave camera alone. And so, oh my God. Genius home. Fucking Jedi Knight Dude. He's a Jedi Knight. Holy Shit. Yeah. He's amazing. He's amazing. Um, but now I get to learn from him and so that, um, does he make any where g uh, he's not making me, but I, I do and I would and have no problem with it. Um, he's definitely, he says like, I need to go to classes, which I absolutely agree with, you know, as a high level striker or any kind of Stryker going into m a you need to go to the fucking classes and learn to swim in the deep end. Yeah. You have to and just be like, all right, this sucks. I'm just getting like fucking armpit a suffocated. It's fine. Just deal with it. Um, but uh, with Dave I can feel myself changing into the fighter that I want to be. How often are you doing Jujitsu? Um, well, right now I've been traveling sometimes as much, but I was doing it like every day. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          01:05:45       And with your knee, I know you have like a limited amount of mobility with one of your name. Yeah. Yeah. Is that getting in the way of anything?

Speaker 2:          01:05:51       Um, it does definitely have to like just put a brace on her or anything. No, I just uh, communicate clearly with my training partners. So funny thing is I love heal hooks and I've had four knee surgeries. Isn't that weird?

Speaker 3:          01:06:08       It's a little weird. That's active as fuck. That's the only submission I go for. Really. He'll hook knee bar. Well listen, that's a very good submission. I mean it's revolutionized Jujitsu I alley over the last few years. The leg lock game is really taken over. Do you think it was like if somebody had that many surgeries you'd be like, no, I'm not fucking with that. Well how about John? Actually I'm like getting in there. John Donner as a fake hip. He's got a fake knee. Oh Wow. Really? His whole body's getting replaced and he's one of the main minds at the head of the leg lock revolution. Eddie Commons being one of them and, and then a lot of the students, you know, awesome. Gary tone of course. There's so many really good Jujitsu guys now that are leg lock specialists fast and Craig Jones is like a whole new crew of up and coming guys that are leg lock specialists.

Speaker 3:          01:06:57       I love it. Yeah, it's really interesting. It's really interesting because all the years that I did you Jitsu, it took like this transition like which only took place within the last decade, like less than a decade where it really started ramping up back in the day. If you did it, you just, if you were in a Jujitsu tournament and do the leg lock or a heel hook, the crowd would boo. They'd fucking scream. They would scream. Even if you won by tap, like if you went to the worlds and you heal hook somebody, people would freak the fuck out. That's so dumb. It's crazy. That's what it used to be. It used to be that they thought of it as cheap. They thought leg locks and heal hooks and ankle locks. They thought those were cheap moves, but it's literally part of the body. Well, it what it is is people that didn't understand the defense, so they would move the wrong way and get their legs blown apart and nobody wants to get their legs blown apart and training.

Speaker 3:          01:07:48       So they would discourage it and training and discourage it and competition because it was ripping people's legs apart. Retarded. Well, it's just a lack of understanding what your shoulder is a very complex joint. We have zero problem manipulating the shit out of people shoulders. It's a weak joint to make joint terrorism complex and unique. Yeah. Yeah. And we have no problem with that. Nobody. Nobody says we gotta outlaw right about that. Yeah. Somehow or another, if you fuck your shoulder up, you can't wipe your ass. That's okay. But if you fuck your knee up, we can't walk. Good carriage. If you can wipe your own ass, well not a problem for you. Why over this with my super toilet does toilets are awesome. I'm going to take a picture of that and post that on Instagram. Go ahead. Feel free. I tell people about them.

Speaker 3:          01:08:32       They're amazing. That's awesome. They keep it clean and pause. It's comfy. It's like a warm seat. As soon as I sat down I was like, ah. Oh, nice. Right. Oh yeah. That's a good life. That's good. This is the good life. Yeah. Uh, it's weird. Like what? I mean, why is it okay to yank on someone's neck? I mean, I didn't know so many dudes with fucked up next. And he's like, all of Jujitsu is bad for your body. The tingling going down my arm right now when I sit in certain positions, oh, he's just wrestling and Jujitsu never happened. No guarantee. I know what that is. It's a pinched nerve. Means you got a bulging disc. No, that's what it means. Not all the time though. Almost always. No. The tingling. Yeah. The tingling is called a nerve is being pushed on by a disk.

Speaker 3:          01:09:19       Yeah. Most of the time. That's what that is. Until the wheels fall off. Yeah. Well, but the wheels are not off. You can strengthen things and, and, and you can do a lot of, have you ever fucked around with spinal decompression? So a lot of really cool devices that you could do at home. Just hang spot. Yeah. You put this harness on the straps to the door and it like supports your head, like pulls on your neck, stretches and relaxes your neck. Yeah, it's fantastic. Really good. Yeah. That'll help a lot and sign that. And then after, uh, we have pieces of paper you could write on your paper. Okay. I'll text it to you. I'll text you, I'll text you all this stuff cause I'm, I'm a fanatic about helping people with neck injuries because a, I had a pretty significant bulging discs that was making my hands numb.

Speaker 3:          01:10:14       I was really worried and my elbow was always in pain and I thought you're going to damage my elbow. And it turned out what was going on as the nerve. My disc was pushing as a nerve in my neck and then the ulnar nerve, which goes all the way down to your pinkie tips of my fingers. It's like over here, right? Yeah. Yeah. That was hurting weird since I broke my elbow in her head. Well, I'm sure it's all that inflammation and scar tissue and shit, but um, there's a bunch of different devices to, there's a thing called the iron neck that I love to talk to people about too. It's like a halo you put on those help strengthen all this stuff too. Yeah. I'll show it to you after. After, after dupont pull on my, I'm fine. I'm totally fine. But wrestling like this head cranks cranks, even Jujitsu is not as bad as wrestling for me. John John Machado always says, never trust your neck. Just don't trust your neck. Never think you're next going to hold up. Some guys like they'll shoot

Speaker 1:          01:11:14       him for a take down. Someone will get them in a gay teen and I just try to gut through it out of it. Never Trust your neck, never trust your neck. That sucks. Yeah, neck is a weird thing. There's little bones that are held in place by tendons. And this gelatinous mush in between him and in between is the fucking cord that communicates from your brain all the way down to all your limbs. And we're cranking on that thing. Like this is the housing for the cord that keeps your body moving from your brain and people are getting you fucking chugs crushing your neck. It's crazy now. Now when I do Jujitsu and whole different mindset, I'm really don't fucking touch my neck. Yeah. Don't touch my neck. Don't make it. I'll sneak an elbow in there.

Speaker 1:          01:11:58       Do you put your hair up and buns and shit and like, yeah, I try, but it's probably used to weld like lawn to, you can pull it off. Itchy moms wanting to choose mine. I pull it off and should be done it before you get a crew cut. He'd look up bad ass bitch with a crew cut. Like, why not? Why not for a comeback fight? Look in fucking, it's not a bad move. I'm already four. He's here, you know, I got to at least keep some kind of thing. Go take feminine. Hmm. Okay. So I'm getting the lines, I gotta at least try to rose number units to the game. I think rose looks just as beautiful, if not more beautiful is she know if she was an actress, she looks like an a list actress, doesn't she? She has that presence but she doesn't give a fuck.

Speaker 1:          01:12:55       Like she's so yeah. That's a big part of what it is. So interesting. So present. Beautiful. She is beautiful but beautiful person. Her heart and hurts. Yes. Yeah, yeah. No, she's amazing. Yeah. Yeah. And um, they don't know. I don't think they appreciate that as much. They don't appreciate it enough. You know, like how gorgeous she is. Like she doesn't get enough press or attention or if she had, if she had her hair and she played the game. Yeah. Cause she literally looks like a mini supermodel with the little muscles. Like, yeah. Well I remember when she fought Michelle Waterson, the karate hottie everybody's making this big deal out of how hot Michelle Waterson is, who's very beautiful but so's rose Rose's equally gorgeous if not more. The look, the, it's a different type of look like Michelle Waterson would be like a hosting a cable entertainment show, ie news or something. Right. And rose not Munis would be like the lead in a, in a movie. Right. That's the difference in beauty. She just has this like, interesting look to her. She has this kind of like a challenging beauty, you know? Yeah. And it's even her expression. Yeah. We're, we're Michelle Waterson is, there's something much more comfortable about her beauty. Like

Speaker 2:          01:14:11       she's really exotic. She's like tie and white or something. Right. Okay. Yeah. She's gorgeous. But she, she's doesn't have as something, she hasn't had that challenging thing. Do you know what I mean? Yeah. I wouldn't look nowhere near as good as rose, so. Well, that's very nice. Um, so what kind of physical conditioning do you do if you don't do any iron? Next stuff? No, spinal decompression. What do you do? Um, I was doing a bit of crossfit and a bit of, um, just fight training as, so I've been out so long when I started to get, be getting back in. Like I told you before we started, I went fucking crazy and that was a bad idea at 41 at the time, it was last year and I had a total body breakdown where it hurts a full hold my cell phone. I like burning pain in my forearms, just holding my cell phone. How long did it take you to get to that spot? That spot? About four months of hard. Yeah. Like doing Jujitsu. So I was over at half, Gracie in San Francisco and I was doing legs a hard spot. Sometimes I do fuck around. I know Kurt ender. Yeah. Whenever I talked to somebody that trained in house, I'll go, Ooh, yeah. Fucking you swam with the sharks? Yeah, I did. I did. Um, but it was, how come you don't have Kurt on?

Speaker 2:          01:15:32       He, he, he called me. He's just like that in person. Oh, I'm sure. It's just like that. We're both friends with Bordain. I just never got to meet for Dane was alive. I'm sorry about that. Um, he collects a medieval weapons and he'll shoot them. I love how we fucking takes videos where you just see his feet and his feet, those toes or isn't gnarled tape. They seen his fingers. Yeah, there are a mess. Yeah. Yeah. Well those gay guys, man, they just damaged the shit out of their fingers. I keep telling Kurt his big toe, it looks like a, like one of those dildos in the Castro. Like it looks like, yeah, it looks like a, like a butt plug. All those in the Castro. Oh those, it looks like a butt plug. It's the like that big walls. Old Guys, their hands just turn into a gnarled messes.

Speaker 2:          01:16:28       It looks as though always trapped. He looks like a mountain troll. Little bit. I love that guy is an animal. He said, what else does he do? Yeah. And he's a great cook is too. And then also, um, fuck. What does he do? Was he in a band? He does a lot of acid. He was in a band and he like buys instruments. It's like I'm gonna learn how to play this. And then he's like building additions onto his house. And did you start his own school recently? Yes. That, okay. That whole transition, that was like game of Thrones. Oh really? I don't know any quiz. I'm not, I don't know that much about it. I just remember like everybody

Speaker 3:          01:17:10       had little groups and was like, who are you with? And it was just like, yeah, I'm not really used to that. And Moy, Tai, we don't, it's not as, I mean there's some of it, but not like that. And it's happening many times. There's been many foldings and unfolding. Are you with me, my brothers, and I'm just like, ah, oh no. I'm with myself. I'm just, I'm just a blue belt. I want just a 12 year old blue blue belt over here. You know? Like, I don't really care how, I guess I, I understand it because it really popular school can be incredibly lucrative. You know, there's so many schools. That's one of the weird things about California that people like people that live in places without a lot of Jujitsu, they would go crazy here. They wouldn't know where to go within this. Where we are right now. We could drive in three minutes and go to five Jujitsu places. I needed you to recommend some firmware for me to train. I'm down here, I'll get you a bunch of places. But I mean we're in the valley, but I, I could tell you there's a place in it and see knows a place over here in Woodland Hills has a place in Canoga Park. There's a place over there. It's a place over here. You can go further out. I didn't even, they're everywhere. Think about that. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          01:18:15       Like being in an area where there's no Jujitsu.

Speaker 3:          01:18:18       Oh there's places. Yeah. I mean one of the things when Bordain was really getting into Jujitsu, he was training every day even on the road. So he travels, he, well sometimes it's easy. It's hard when you're a celebrity. Oh boy. Yeah. Yeah. He would send me text messages about it. Shit. Now bone fragments cause too, it's just be smashing him cause you know, they will sort of make an example out of some celebrity guy who wants to learn Jujitsu, crushing him. But you know, he would go to, like when he was in Bozeman, when he was in Montana, there was no Jujitsu there, so he had to go to like a club, I think it was in billings or something like that. So He'd travel to where they did this club and it was just a bunch of like enthusiasts. They would get together. It wasn't even like real teaching.

Speaker 3:          01:19:01       That's great. You know? And he would train with them, play like a, they have a TV with the video up and they worked the move. If you have a good good video and a good athlete you, you can learn something from that can do attitude, a little bit of elbow grease, a little bit of that man. I think there's never been a better time to do that. Then now with all the youtube videos, it's really an incredible time. Even if you're not in a place with a really good Jujitsu, you can learn, but you can definitely find something that you really need someone to go, no, no. I hear now go like this. And you look, oh, just a little subtle adjustments that someone knows from years and years and years of training. It's all about the sensitivity of leverage. Yeah. It's just that sweet spot.

Speaker 2:          01:19:45       The Thai clinch. It's just that like that little difference if like when they putting the elbows into like right in here and write like pulling into that little, that little hook area right behind your head there. Yeah. I was working, I'm helping some of the MMA guys at gorilla with their Thai clinch and the one of the wrestlers was grabbing up there and grabbed the back of your head and it

Speaker 1:          01:20:07       kind of looks like they're gonna make out. And I try not to laugh, but it's hard. It's, I'm sure. I'm sure they want to laugh at me that way. I did it. I did realize that, oh, it's okay. Don't kiss him. Yeah. Maybe later. This is not right now. That is such an underutilized a technique. You know, the, a good plum, someone with a good Moy Thai clinch. Yeah. I mean when, if you haven't felt it before when someone can really grow. Like, I remember when Anderson Silva fought rich Franklin. Rich Franklin just did not know what to do with it. Yes. Anderson grabbed a hold of it and just start smashing it and you realize like the fucking clench the way he would do to so locked down yet such technique. Right. You know what's funny to me as a Muy Thai world champion or ex Muy Thai world champion is that I watched these things and I go through, that's so fucking easy to neutralize.

Speaker 1:          01:21:03       It gets a little bit like you just, yeah, just going to, you know, go like this and what to do or you just like, it's, you don't have to be in that situation. It didn't know what to do. Yeah. Yeah. But I mean to this day there's still fights that I'll watch in the UFC where I'll see their grappling and I'll just go, Jesus fucking Christ. Get your foot. What are you doing? Good. Yeah. This is white belt stuff. This is blue belt stuff surprises me when I watch that. Cause I think like, you know, what do I know? I'm in like a high level striker if I don't like because you don't fucking know this and you're in the UFC. You don't fucking know this. How do you not fucking know this? It's you. You're dealing with people that come from all over the world.

Speaker 1:          01:21:39       Right? Like when Francis and gone, oh, fought steep Emile chick for the title. Right. Literally didn't is really recent, but have you ever want to watch that again? Yeah. It was rough to watch ever. Yeah, I have terrible. I don't really like watching heavyweight fight that much. Why is that? Uh, it's a little too slow. It's usually not as technical. That's true. But when they land, yeah, I know, but I mean you can get people that are smaller and more technical and faster and they can land heavy punches too. That's true. But maybe cause you're there live so you can feel the ground shake or me, I'm just watching on the TV so I don't feel it. Did you see when Francis knocked out Alistair Overeem? I think I did. Yeah. If you need to see it again and then you need to see that again because this is something that, this is some life. Change my life. Watch this. Boom. Yeah, watch this. I know this boy, this left tour, but it's crazy that I know. So scary and his striking is so dangerous that even Allister, a guy who's been around forever, he fought so wild and open. His hands were down. Yeah. Where was his head movement and where was his head movement? I mean, he was moved a little bit in the beginning of the consequences are so scary. Yeah. Very little head movement. Head movement. Have very little know. Some guys are picking up more tattoo. Yeah, no, especially Maurice. I know him.

Speaker 3:          01:23:06       Straight center line. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Well, when I think guys like Simon Marcus start working with Floyd Mayweather senior and then other, when do you start working with them? I don't know. How long has he been with? I know. I don't know. I just watch videos on the line. Simon Marcus, number one on the improvements. I'm sure he's improving, but I dunno. He's still pretty young. I mean, Simon is only like 30 Simon Marcus, number one on, um, Instagram. I think the real problem with Moy Tai and, uh, even with kickboxing is just a lack of promotion and a lack of understanding from the general public. To me, I get very excited whenever a Gloria van is ana. Here he is. Whenever a Gloria van is on gimme a little zeroes. It's been an amazing year as an honor and pleasure to be able to work with boxing legend Floyd Mayweather, Sr four left at Jimmy said, kid, you're going to be all right. It looks good there, you know, but I mean, you're talking about a guy with just a tremendous amount of understanding of boxing. Do you ever see when he fought sugar ray Leonard Bending

Speaker 2:          01:24:09       his, uh, uh, uh, he's bending his legs. Finally. Simon Marcus, right? Oh, he's shifting his weight to, as opposed to like the Moitai style. Yeah. It's hard for him though. [inaudible] Eco. It's, it's not like a, it's not and easy. It's like, yeah, but he's, it's hard for him to rotate.

Speaker 3:          01:24:31       Yeah. Isn't it interesting because yeah, he's a world champion and he's a devastating striker and he just fucked a lot of people up. But the limitations of the style that he imposes and the way, the way he does it, when he's trying to learn a different, more smooth way of doing things, you see that the stiffness.

Speaker 2:          01:24:48       So in, uh, the boxing, they generate that power from the feet and the like, the rotating and the, you know what I mean? Like kind of like a gas pedal and a brake, right? You're like, ah, ah, and white tie. It's not like that. When they punched, they're like, mm, mm mm.

Speaker 3:          01:25:04       When you say say it, like explain it, explain it for people just listening. Cause that's about half the crowd. Sorry. Um hmm. They're like, what the fuck?

Speaker 2:          01:25:13       Um, like for instance, the rear foot would be the gas and then the front foot would be the brake. So you hit the gas and you're going to go into the sprint. But as soon as you start getting the velocity for the sprint and you Bam, put the breakdown. And then with that, um, counter, um, uh, the contradiction or the opposing forces, it erupts out the top in from your arms and your fists into a powerful punch. And I think with Moitai, they just like step forward instead of rotating from their tours, from anything from their feet and their torso. Is there a benefit to that or does it compliment the style of kicking? A probably more complementing the style of kicking, but I think that if you move your, if you allow for rotation your punches, you allow

Speaker 1:          01:26:04       for the rotation in your feet so you can generate more power and your punches. You can still then take the necessary step out at an angle and then, um, and then stepping high with your feet and get a great kick too. Like you just, you can, you can have both. You can have the best of both worlds. Think combines the two things the best. Oh, I love protrusion. Trojans. One of the best armor. He's amazing to watch. Protrusion versus Andy Sour. Yeah. Emma Asados face. Yeah. I think it's about time. It's like get the fuck out this sport. The fuck it was so good. Well Petrosian stills at the top of the game because they were women. He hears these a Ben 10, but he lost to Andy wristy. Right. Was it Andy [inaudible] him. How, what I have, that's another kid. Now I, I will, I want to deal with paper, but I need to see this.

Speaker 1:          01:27:00       Giorgio patrol geans um, Instagram risk. Is this where you got coyote or is this a the sour fights? This our fight, it was a sour fund. He was so young here. Wow. I might not be in wristy. See you can't Google it while you're doing this. Kenya. I go, that's what, we'll get to that afterwards. But yeah, I like so sour. Had this cut under his white. Yeah. And then it kind of goes like bleeding a little bit. And then in his eye, and this is assumptive on my part, but in his eyes when you look at him like interacting with the doctorate, it looks like I, yeah, yeah. It's bad. Yeah, yeah, yeah. You know what I mean? Like why you'll, it's further down in the fight, but Giorgio is so technical and one of the more interesting things to me with Giorgio was watching him train because a lot of it is drilling.

Speaker 1:          01:27:45       I mean, they do so much drilling. Well, that makes sense because you then you can get out of the way. Well, he knows exactly what to do is his brain and his mind or in sync with what to do in the middle of a furious battle so that he doesn't have to think too much. See that massage was excited. He's like, yeah, I'm excited. This is exciting. What's going to happen? Not towards the end. That was fucking horses. Yeah. Yeah. Once it starts awesome. Kay. It's fucking amazing. I just, I just wished that kickboxing got more press and more excitement in America because I think it's more exciting than boxing. If there's more to look at you and you're seeing with, um, American champions, you, you're seeing fantastic knockouts. You see an amazing wins. I mean, the only one who's really doing all the sports at a high level as Gastrin, gastrin belong, look at his face now. This is after the first round. Yeah. He's like, Oh shit, what time? When does this go to the distance? Um, yeah, I think, yeah, go get into like the end rounds when patrols you and really starts tuning them up. It's so interesting because he would just sort of find out where your openings were, where the rhythm was, where to move and we're not to move and you're making mistakes

Speaker 3:          01:29:02       and like a computer when you do it, you just see him plug in the techniques to fill those holes and you'd see like the little subtle steps and you know,

Speaker 1:          01:29:11       he always knows what you're going to throw next or where you're going to be or what you're going to do. And you know, he's so amazing and there's the cut. He was one of the best ever for sure. And just an interesting guy to watch. He does. He's doesn't look like he's doing much like of that. That was, he barely moved. Right. Doesn't like doing much. But uh, press housing is just right there. He's barely moving.

Speaker 3:          01:29:38       Just moving. Just enough. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Somebody k owed him in glory. And like I said, I think it's Andy wristy pull up. Uh, I need to see that Giorgio Petrosian record. I'm like, what? Yeah. It was pretty shocking. And it was in the big Madison Square Garden debut. They were in the theater at Madison Square Garden. Yeah. Just take lanky power of power. Stryker think it was rusty. Is it rusty? It was. He has fucking hard and he caught Giorgio and boom, the lights went out. Yeah. First round too. Yeah, it was crazy. And again, this was like glory had seriously hyped up the fact that Georgia Petrolia is like one of the best ever and undefeated fantastic record. And uh, Andy Rusty,

Speaker 1:          01:30:25       maybe it was the beard. I don't think it was, I think he just got clipped

Speaker 3:          01:30:30       and maybe it was also a lot of pressure. Right. You know, fighting in Madison Square Garden, fighting on in Glory, glory, putting all this stuff behind him. And you know, the thing is too, nobody ever knows what the fuck is going on with a fighter when they're coming into a fight. Right. You could be dealing with injuries, sickness, training camp, bad weight cut girlfriend.

Speaker 1:          01:30:49       I was talking to a friend of mine and they were talking about how they were dealing with their coach. Um, drug youth. Their coach had a drug problem and they weren't there for them for the fight. And so they went into a world title defense like that. She said it wasn't the first round I was wrong cause it looks like here we are on the second or third. This is the third, there's or the third. So it was in the third round. My memory's not that good. See it's guy just made it a brawl. Yes. Well he just made it ugly. He's like no respect. He also fucking hit super hard. That's a part of the problem is it's surprising because Patricia patrician usually it doesn't get entangled like this. You know, he's really good at keeping, oh, can we say that again? Or they'll play it again. They, he's really good at damn uptown keeping space. Yeah. He's really good at maintaining a good range for himself. But he's getting all the tangled up here. Yeah. I wonder what he thinks about this fight. I would love to hear it. I would love to hear like what was wrong. Like what, what leading up to this fight speaks Italian cause translate. Oh fuck. It's done that before with Yoel Romero. I,

Speaker 3:          01:31:59       Joey Diaz translate for Yoel Romero. That's why I'm like it or not. This is the 44th 40 year olds, uh, not on steroids. Jammed full of Jesus. Yeah. I like it or not. I mean, and they're like, this is amazing. He's a genetic freak. Yeah. But you know, he was on the podcast. He was talking about it. He's like, go to Cuba. He goes like, everybody looks like me. He's like this fucking genes down there. But it kind of makes sense. You know, I mean the slave trade led to all these like reading and not just that, but also high level athletic pursuits, right? Because they're just there. They put so much emphasis on athletes and so much emphasis on, you know, they probably have an athlete's fuck. Other athletes, you know, I mean if you get Serena Williams and Lebron James to have a kid, what are the odds that kid's not a bad mother fucker.

Speaker 3:          01:32:48       It's 0% right. The kid would be a beast, right? It'd be a super athlete, seller egg or the sperm cell, everything. So it all put it together, combine it and mix it up. I'd love to see that. You imagine if like two super athletes just decided like, hey baby, I got an idea. Like let's just find out. We can get along. Yeah, let's just make a kid. Or like not even, not even like a, you know, hey baby. Just like, hey, you want to just do a thing? It's like eating. Then you'll just do it. You care of me not fuck it up. Yeah. That's the thing. But they like a certain contract. Yes. But here's the thing, and this I wanted to talk to you about, cause I know you had a rough childhood. The reality is a certain amount of fucking you up gives you a certain amount of fuel that allows you to accomplish things that a person with a cushy life and always had a warm bed and always had plenty of love. They, there's like a, you have a good sure. Right? For sure. Yeah. You have a gear that someone who lived a wonderful life with perfect environment and perfect upbringing probably doesn't have, it's more like like, okay, I'll do it alone. Yeah. Like, oh, okay. Right. But it's also the, the need to do it alone.

Speaker 3:          01:33:58       The need to prove people, the need to show people. Yeah.

Speaker 5:          01:34:02       You know? Yeah. Yeah. For sure.

Speaker 3:          01:34:06       Everybody I know that's interesting. Had a fucked up childhood. Filey Yup. I don't know anybody that didn't you too. Yeah. Really. Sure, Huh? Yeah. I haven't talked to my dad's. It's all seven. He's alive. He's got the same name. So cuddly and not bitter woman. Nice person. And I have a lot of Nice friends. Yeah. But I've, I've cultivated this, this is something that I've actively cultivated for decades. We have worked really hard to be a nice person. Yeah. And I know the benefit of being a nice person, like how it makes me feel and how it makes other people feel. And I know that that spreads and it makes other people nicer. And I try, I work on it hard to keep the wolf in a cage. Always let out sometimes. Sometimes. It's a lot of times. I remember one time when you and I were at a Moitai event together, um, uh, you were there and I ran into you there. And it's funny watching fights with you because, uh, you, you were, and you were, you were like gritting your teeth and you were like, and then you looked over me. He goes, don't you don't even want it. Don't you want to just fuck somebody up? Don't you want to just smash some weights fucking face? They're like, damn, Miriam, I gotta get the fuck away from me.

Speaker 3:          01:35:17       When was this? It was a long time ago in la. Remember la had that pro Moitai thing where, um, uh, who fought a bull cow FOBT. Um, there was some good, it was a good one.

Speaker 2:          01:35:29       Oh my God. So you know what that was? It was Moitai League. Yes. So you know what it was, uh, I had an ACL surgery. Right. And I couldn't fight. That's right. And I was supposed to fight. Right. I was seizing, seizing, walking, and I was watching these fights and they were fucking garbage and I couldn't fight. Yeah. Yeah. That was 2000. Oh, I remember that. Yeah. God dammit. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I was like, oh, it would be these pitches. I really would

Speaker 3:          01:36:00       wish that event took off. Cause that was fun. It was great having that in La. Ernesto hoose was doing the commentary as well. And um,

Speaker 2:          01:36:08       yeah, Ben didn't volunteer to fight in that. I think she did. I would be, had been very curious to see how a Valentino versus Julie Kitchen want to turn out. Mm. Yeah. Well I'm interesting. I'm really curious to see how she does in the UFC at 125 pounds. She's a beast because she's going to be strong at that. Wait, that's her weight. She's not a one 35 right. You see how like she looks like fighter fit, like lean and cut ripped. Like even her legs when she was one 35 her legs look soft, you know? And she was still winning. Yeah, yeah, yeah. She dropped Holly Holm. Yeah. That's crazy. I mean, she's Holly Holmes like one 45 or probably, you know, like, well she comfortably, comfortably we at one 45 it's not like, oh they're going a one 35 are going up to one 45 she was like a big ass one 30 Fiverr and she went the distance with Cyborg. Yeah. At one 45 which is a fucking, that's a statement in and of itself. Well, it's just the boxer. Yeah. So they're used to getting it different. Yeah. Yeah. You know?

Speaker 3:          01:37:09       Yeah. And I think she got fucked in the title fight when she fought a Durand to me. I thought she should have won that fight for sure. I do. And I think the cheap shot, the cheap shot to sheep, cheap shots, two of them after the bell, one of them that significantly hurt her and I think parents should have been taken away for sure. Yup. Yup, Yup, Yup. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          01:37:26       It's crazy sport. Holly Holmes, amazing. She is as a person, I've never met her, but she seems nice person ever. She seems really sweet and she just seems like I was listening to her interviews, you know, it's just, she seems just like a really uplifted, genuine person, know a super humble, you know, she really is, which is one of the weirder moments. Why was such a weird moment rather when Ronda Rousey at

Speaker 1:          01:37:55       the Wayans was like, you fucking bitch yourself. You're a fucking fake. And it was weird. It was like, where's this? It was like almost like she wanted her to be the enemy so that she get amped up to kick her ass. So sue sang a bunch of things. It didn't even make sense. Maybe even Rhonda was kind of at a breaking point too, just as far as like workload, stress, level, um, expectations, you know, obligations. And when I saw that way in, actually I, I've watched that probably at least five times. Like I just replayed it and like, cause I like to watch people interact and how they react. I love it. Yeah. And I noticed like when I saw that, I'm like, oh, Holly's got this and I wish I'd fucking bet buddy. It's totally, wish I did. But now I was watching and I was like, oh, just stop because Ron Ron to seem so emotional. Um, it was the way Holly reacted. That's why mm. She's just, she's just like Rhonda came in her space. Holly just like stepped back, like kept proper distance, you know, like defensive distance. I'm super, super low key watch her reaction.

Speaker 1:          01:39:09       Yeah. She stayed calm for sure. Yeah. That's, that's skinny Rhonda too. That's way in Rhonda, which is like, she's been depleted. Yeah. Yeah. She was Kinda, she was to look how much difference which is weighing in

Speaker 1:          01:39:24       yeah. Tied up and how he didn't give any ground either and she's just like, she stayed calm. She, she backed up, but like she backed up like I'm ready to hit you. Backed up. She didn't back up like, ah, and then so Rhonda was a super like emotional too. She was funny. She was like, all this is just trying to get a drink. Yeah. I just thought I was having a drink. I Dunno. Yeah. Yeah. It was great. And then Ron was like us, she was super right. And you never saw her like that. You're like, what the fuck? Yeah. Yeah. I think you nailed it. As far as the breaking point. Yeah. She got sucked into all the Hollywood bullshit. They were putting her in movies and TV shows and choose on different talk shows as the type to like someone. Could she beat Cain Velasquez? Could she, you know, and it's like, oh my God, look what she's doing to these women. Could she remember that? Right? There's like, wow. It was the creative, she was a superstar. You know, I'm, look, I was a part of this. I mean she has now, she's still a superstar now. She's a WWE superstar. It's just a different kind of superstar. Do you think she should? Yeah. Well makes you say that.

Speaker 4:          01:40:34       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:40:35       Like, don't go out like that. This is Miriam target now. It's a different person. Oh, she just, she deserves better than to go out the way you know her last fight. Well, she deserves, she's exactly what she got. She's,

Speaker 3:          01:40:54       no, no, this is what I think she's better than that. That's think you're writing. I think you're right. That she's better than that. It's bad that she got punched like that. No, no, no, no, no. I'm saying she, she just, she deserves better than that to like represent herself better than yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. I don't think that matters to her as much as it matters for other folks. I think she really cemented her legacy is one of the greatest women's MMA champions ever in a pioneer. But I also think that women's MMA has evolved so fast that within the brief time that she was running shit, the sport passed her by. And when you see, the one that I was always worried about with her was Amanda. Cause I was like, Amanda Nunez has a black belt in Brazilian Jujitsu and nasty hands like to me.

Speaker 3:          01:41:40       Um, I think she has some judo. I Dunno what her, her ranking isn't judo. I don't know. She could be, but I know she's a black belt in Jujitsu and I know she had heavy hands. And my thought was at Rhonda, although she was developing good striking skills. She's known for a judo in her arm bars. That's her big thing. And the striking skills were sort of like something that was happening along the way and she was starting to catch girls, but she was catching girls like batch go, hey. Uh, and you know, and yeah, and, and beating them down when she gets them down, they're not nearly on the level of an Amanda Nunez. Like you're not going to catch her like that. And if she, right, exactly. And my thought was that if, if it was going to go down, it was going to be Amanda because Amanda just hit so fucking hard.

Speaker 3:          01:42:25       And then, so when she came back and immediately fought for the world title against Amanda, she needed a gimme fuck. Yeah, she needed, she needed a different camp. I think that's fair. She needed a lot. She needed a revamping of her approach. She needed a lot of things. She had a lot of things because people knew, first of all, she never shoots for doubles. She's not taking you down with the lower body attack. It's always upper body and it's always a clinch. And she clinches with her left arm. I mean Greg Jackson, Jackson Winkeljohn, they all figured that out. And Holly had the solution for that. Yeah. You know it also does. Another thing is when you can't fucking head kicked into oblivion that way. Like you need a lot of time off. A lot of time with the no sparring, no nothing. Especially as being so high.

Speaker 3:          01:43:07       I think so untouchable and high and then getting coming crashing down to earth like that. So it's rough. That's a definitely like a big, who am I moment? I think I'm sure. Yeah. Well look, can we talk right? But you were talking about you trying to figure out who you are when you couldn't train anymore. He and I had that on such a s like small scale, a pride compares private skill and hurts personally but private. And heres this the world. Yes. In the whole world. Uh, mine was like more tragic and hers was more humiliating, humiliating. Mm. You know, how was yours more tragic? Um, it happened in third round

Speaker 2:          01:43:52       of a fight, a world title fight, MMA. Um, it wasn't a clear like it happened on a takedown. It wasn't a takedown that Tor twerked or tweaked my knee, you're grabbed on my knee or it was, um, I pushed against them while my body was like this, um, uh, parallel to the ground and uh, I tore my own ACL. Yeah. So it was like, why is that more tragic? Um, because it was more like, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Um, I think it's more humiliating to get knocked out, in my opinion, to get knocked out sure. Than it is to get like, injured out, like, like tear, tear out, like still fighting. And then you'd step back and you, everything slips and you fall. Right. Because your knee can't, it's gone. Yeah. You know, that's what I mean when I say tragic or if you're like winning the, winning the for the fight. And then unfortunate. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So it's more

Speaker 3:          01:44:53       fortunate and then your identity stripped away. But again, yours is private. Hers is public, but at least you understand what it's like to not be that person who you di you counted on, you being that person as part of your shield that you put on to go through the day. Yeah,

Speaker 2:          01:45:08       for sure. For sure. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So her persona, um, she's damn good at it too. And then it's like stripped away.

Speaker 3:          01:45:19       Well, she was the first, well, Gina Carano was the first, right. The people sort of identified with like, wow, here's this pretty girl who kicks ass and this is crazy. We never seen this before, but it was at a smaller scale. People just didn't, they didn't kind of understand who she was or what she was [inaudible] it wasn't as big. Yeah. It wasn't nearly as big as tiny in comparison. Yeah. But then when Ron came along, it was like this perfect storm. It's like the UFC was huge. Everything was taking off and then here's his girl, just fucking everybody up

Speaker 2:          01:45:48       hers. Hers was much more, uh, violence to me. Then Gina's like, she'd like, you're getting slammed, right. And just like, you know what I mean? And when your arm broke. Yeah, basically like recruit some super group when she fought Misha and cranked her on the show is amazing. 21 tab man. I snapped her arm and half. God Damn. Yeah. And she's still not tapping. It's like a tearing the chicken and the, exactly. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. I mean she has a bad ass for that one now during all this time. I mean this is when

Speaker 3:          01:46:20       Rhonda is taking off and when Holly's taking off and Amanda Nunez is taking off all this time is when you're at your peak, you're at your peak as a fighter and then you're dealing with all these fucking injuries and you're working your way to get into this circus. I mean, you're, you're working in way to step into this arena. I mean, this is, this is like ultimately this was your goal. Yeah. What the fuck is that like to be just sitting there on their, dealing with all this bullshit watching else do it. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          01:46:50       Oh, it was maddening. Well I think about the time that I was sitting next to you watching those fights. Yeah. Do you want fucking smash him making me fucking nervous. It was worse actually. So that time I only blew up to one 65. Um, this time I blew up to one 86. Yeah, it was big. Well, you use, that's almost, that's almost one nine. Yeah, it was 200. Yeah, exactly. Exactly. And uh, I was um, I'm drinking and it was an eating ride and I was, yeah, it a bunch of stuff. So how'd you turn around? Um, ultimately I think, so I taught rock steady boxing. It's a Roxy to boxing is a program for people with Parkinson's disease and it teaches them how to box and that helps them, uh, with their symptoms and their quality. It improves their quality of life and gives them a sense that it gives them a community to, to be in.

Speaker 2:          01:47:50       And the interesting about rock city boxing was, I thought I was going to be, it was a terrible fit and I was terrified that I was gonna hurt them and it actually was the best fit. And they loved being in my classes and I love teaching them and like honestly, they healed my heart. Like they healed that. Not good enough that I felt wow. Yeah. It was pretty crazy. So teaching and helping people. Yeah. We're brought it around for you and like seeing understanding that I can definitely understand like, my body is doing this and I want to do that and there's, I can't do anything about it, you know, and that frustration and it's infuriating and I'm like watching them go through what they, they go through and it was just incredible. And they just show up and they, they, they just work so hard and they're just fighting, scrape a little grandmas and grandpas.

Speaker 2:          01:48:47       Wow. Yeah. Did you see the rock city video? No. Uber. Uber. Uber did a mini documentary on me. Yeah. I've never seen it. Yeah. How long has it made any documentary? Can we watch two minutes now. We'll get kicked off the internet if we pull it off and put it on Youtube. People always claim it or we got our videos taken down unfortunately. Oh, watch it afterwards and I'll tweet it. Yeah, yeah, I'll put it up. That's fucking awesome. And I'll make you, it might make you tear up a little bit or to Europe. Easy. Let me too, I'm a crier. Like, it's not just like sad or like I'm happy I'll cry. I'll actually, after you asked me to be on this podcast, I was having moments, there's like kind of crying all ever since because it was just like, yeah, I was just like, Holy Shit.

Speaker 2:          01:49:35       So for me, coming back to fighting, I, it's Curian was like, we were talking about a game plan about coming back and um, he's like, okay, so this is what I think. I think, you know, getting the right fight, like getting a moist, high fight, maybe WBC diamond belt. And that is like all I wanted when I was active fighting five years, that's all I fucking wanted. Like it broke my heart, hurt my heart that they wouldn't sanction that for women. It was so frustrating to me. And he's talking about that and he's like, yeah, we'll get this fight and then that'll be your way to come back. And I'm like, I don't give a fuck. I don't want another world title. I have enough. Like how much fucking good enough do I need to be? I'm done. Like I just want to be paid.

Speaker 2:          01:50:15       Like just fuck you pay me. I saw all I want. They go. And so when I you say that, but once you start preparing, no, I'm still going to do, it was fucking best of my ability. But I'm not like I would take a fight that's $1,500 $3,000 for a world title fight to get a chance to fight for that world title. Like now I'm like, hell no, no. I will take a non world title fight that pays more over a world title opportunity. Or are you looking to compete now in MMA? Are you looking to compete and Moy Tai or are you looking to compete in kickboxing? I'm looking to compete in whatever pays me touching. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So dollar mode. When you asked me to be on this podcast and I was like, Holy Shit. So this in turn would get my followers up, which in turn would make it so I could get paid more the next time I fight.

Speaker 2:          01:51:05       Do you see that? Yeah. And I was just like, oh my God, this is so like thank you so much. And it was just like, you know, I was just feeling like my eyes welling up with tears and I felt hella nervous. I was like, oh my God. There's like how many subscribers on this shit? Oh Geez. Can I say attention to what I was like, she might be doing a good job. Not microdosing today. No. But, um, what I said to myself, cause I do, I did feel very nervous and I do still, but when I said to myself, I was like, well, it wouldn't be happening if he weren't ready. So this didn't happen before when you were active fighting, you're winning all these world titles. Like you weren't ready. So you're ready now. That's a good attitude. Yeah. But I would have had John back then too.

Speaker 2:          01:51:48       I wasn't ready. You, I'm sure you would have been fine. No, no, I wasn't ready. Really. Yeah. Yeah, for sure. Cause I think I didn't know myself the way I know myself now. I didn't trust myself. I didn't have everything taken. All my strength taken away from me and then I'll come out of it by my, yeah, I mean like one of the things that the rock steady boxing got me back in, like help heal my heart. But also the other thing was like, I kept trying to train, I kept trying to get better. I kept trying to, you know, and lose weight, but my knee was still fucking with me and I'd get inflammation and this and that. And so finally I just said, you know what? I think Dominick Cruz did this too, where he's just like, maybe I don't get to fight again. Like maybe that, that's just what it is and I'm not crying. You're crying. It's okay. I just, okay, I've cried on this project. I made peace with that and then things started getting better. I don't know. I don't know why or how, but like somehow like fixating, it wouldn't let me move forward. Like it just kept holding onto it like wasn't when it wasn't working or I'm going to said, okay, then I don't get to fight again. All right, let it go. And that's when it came back to me. I Dunno.

Speaker 3:          01:53:14       Do you think that, I think will, I think that for the average person that's watching this and doesn't understand this fixation on fighting, I think it comes back to what were talking about before that it's so difficult and so rewarding and so impossible and you're, you're finding out about yourself during the struggle.

Speaker 2:          01:53:35       And then it is my therapy. Yeah. It doesn't like, so I used to do a lot of drugs. Like I used to do math where I weighed 126 pounds. I'm five, nine, that's not normal for me. And I did so much partying, so much drugs, so much like self abuse. And then I started training and I used to smoke a pack of Marlboro reds a day. You know, I would go on benders and stab like four or five days in a row, you know? And, uh, I started training Moy, Tai, and that's when I stopped. Like, it wasn't immediate, it wasn't like quit cold Turkey, you know, I just like over time as I moved towards the goal of fighting and it took me I think five years before I fought. So I started training [inaudible]. It took me five fucking years. And, um, I stopped doing drugs, I stopped partying, I stopped smoking, I stopped, you know, I started having a more disciplined and disciplined, regimented lifestyle and it was just refining some people get sober through working the steps. Training was my steps. Training was my way of getting to know myself and getting to sift through what wasn't me and what was me. I was told a lot of things that I was when I was a kid and I come to find out I wasn't those things. I'm hardworking, I'm disciplined, I'm intelligent, and I'm a, you know, I'm all these other things that I was never told I was, you know, and it was all through fighting. So yeah. Well, fighting

Speaker 3:          01:55:08       gave you a venue that gave you

Speaker 2:          01:55:11       then training. Yes, but I think fighting made me, I know because if only I'd trained, I wouldn't have gone as deep as I needed to go to get to the shit. Right. That fucking like, you know, the cart crust layer that you got to fucking dig under and like get in there and sort of go through that stuff. Yeah. You would have polished yourself up a little bit. Yeah. But it wasn't, it wouldn't have, he'll do changed my makeup or even allowed me to be who I am, you know?

Speaker 5:          01:55:52       Yeah.

Speaker 2:          01:55:53       Like right now it's kind of a trip. Like I feel like I'm in bloom or just learning faster than I ever have. It's easy. And uh, like Dave, it was tripping out on me because he was watching me train or watching stuff I was doing. And it's so much easier to do the things without bullshit in the way. Bullshit and your brain. Yeah. Yeah. Bullshit in my brain and my emotions, my like these limiting beliefs about myself, it's so much easier. Or, or to finally be able to be in a space where I'm like, okay, you're doing this. What am I doing? Okay. I'm not matching what you're doing or what are you feeling? What am I feeling where I think a lot of people, when they first start out, they just do what they're told instead of questioning the concept, questioning the, you know, so it's, it's just, I think the more mature I get, the easier, the more I know myself. So the easier it is to get the information that I need to master the thing.

Speaker 3:          01:57:01       Well, this is always the, the, the big race. They're big races to achieve maturity before your body does. Yeah. Before your body wear and tear on the spotty, on average, especially anybody in combat sports and sports at 42 yeah. And to be able to achieve enough mental maturity while your body is still pliable and, and, and viable, it still works and you can still execute. You still a vitality isn't Demetrius Johnson? Amazing. Fucking amazing. So amazing. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          01:57:37       I'm not even thinking about all the incredible things he does without a fight. I'm thinking about his post fight interview.

Speaker 3:          01:57:42       Oh, he's fantastic. He's amazing. Yeah. No, he's just an awesome dude. He's so just like right there, isn't he? Yeah. He's like, no, this is what I do and this is what it's going to happen and we planned for this and no, no, no, no, no, no. And that's it. Super. Matter of fact, well his coach Matt Hume is one of the grades. Absolutely. I want to meet that guy. I just love to watch that training happen. She's like, get to get to be able to pick up on the energy and the magic in the room. Well, I'd like the fact that he's now going to one FC and one FC is going to pay him a fuck load of money in the US on your season is weird state where the reality financially about the flyweight division is, it's just not a big, big cell. It's not like people are dying to watch 125 pound dudes fight. People don't like tiny men. I mean, it's weird because it's the first one is going to take that as a quote. Take 10 of the context. Probably going to be a picture of you standing there. Jack, the six pack with belts on. Pete talked about

Speaker 1:          01:58:42       tiny men like they're out there other man bits or something fucking weird. That's also a thing that people don't like. But the thing is like, see, I'd like I said it, I don't like watching heavyweights fight. Right. I like watching the smaller weights fight cause usually they're more technical. Well he's just technicals there's, and he's, he moves seamlessly. If this would is talking about being about being able to be authentic, express yourself from moment to moment, you know, and not have to like play it safe and stay back and stay outside in a way. And yeah, he's just in there and he flows. He also does what we talked about earlier where I said that I don't think you should ever fight stupid. That you should fight within the best so you could express your abilities and your techniques the best. And that's what he does.

Speaker 1:          01:59:26       Situational condom on every, you know what I mean? Even though he's being offensive, he still has protection. Right. Listen, situational condoms, condom. It's a funny way of putting it. Yeah, that is true. Yeah. Is, um, what are you leaning towards you? I mean, I know you're saying like, what if you get an equal offer, an equal offer and Muay Thai and equal offer an MMA would, what would you lean towards? I would want to do MMA, but tie it would be, yeah man. Wait has never fucking loved me back. Whoa. Serious Shit right there. I said, man, I'm still, I was never loved you back. No. So that's some deep childhood shit right there, Mary. Yeah, Mary world or world champion childhood. Like I had my baby beginnings as a champion. So do you also, first of all, you have a massive advantage and stand up over most girls in MMA.

Speaker 1:          02:00:23       That's also been a deal. It doesn't matter if I don't make the adjustment. Of course, of course. So I can't think that like, oh, I'm better because like oftentimes with a lot of MMA, MMA fighters and Cesar Gracie said this to me, he's like in MMA, the girls, they're like pit bulls. Like they don't have the technique, but they have, they have the, they get by on the toughness. So like with a pit bull you like you'd have to kill it, right? Yeah, yeah, yeah. There's a lot of that for sure. We'll definitely, um, fluster the fuck out of a high level striker. I mean look at the Petrosian and rusty. Yeah. Yeah. But in diversity is pretty high level too though. But I've never seen, not that I've watched all the puck Trojans fights, but I have never seen him get entangled like that, that often.

Speaker 1:          02:01:14       True. That is not, and risky. Just made it ugly. He made it a brawl. And that's why you, it's an interesting fight. But who knows? Like I said, who knows where he was at? What was going on in his head? Injuries, sickness. Who knows what happened? That beard. The beard. Yeah. I Dunno. Cowboy Cerrone looks as good as it's ever looked his last fight. Yeah, but that's phony. That's not petroleum for traditions like sexy. He's got the sexist, the Toronto, me, Donald, Donald Cerrone's not sexy. Not like the way Petrossian is like everything. Petrossian is like pretty the things he does, the way he fights. It's pretty, oh, I see what you're saying. It's like part what? He's sexy. He's like patrol and he's Italian. Okay. Yeah. Yo come on Georgia. Yeah, I see what I mean. You shouldn't have that fucking beard. Plucked them up. Made them less aerodynamic. Okay.

Speaker 1:          02:02:02       I'm a big believer in beer power. So my dad had a beard growing up and now I see all these 30 year olds, 20 year olds hipsters with like their beard oil and their periods and I'm just like gross. I have a real problem with beards with men that looked like they would break real easy. You know I can't stand man with skinny necks. Yeah, that's a, that's an uncomfortable buff dudes with skinny necks. That means they're not doing anything because I'm just like, that's shit's not real. Right. You'll get, you'll get fucked up. Yeah. That's just not real. You can't fight. Your head's barely hanging on there like a chicken and the third world country where they just like that and rip the head off the chicken. Well it shows a severe lack of core strength cause like if you're doing like dead lifts and if you're doing anything with your traps, you're going to develop a thick neck.

Speaker 1:          02:02:58       If you're doing anything where you got up, hoist things up off the ground, you have a look at those mother fuckers in the Olympics at do dead lifts. They have giant ass net. Then I gradually anybody they have huge next. Yeah, because they're doing this whole time that's all fucking neck and back and the whole spinal column has to be strong. He looks scary, man. It's guys who are doing this shit and then they're posing. They pose it guys with Nintex has the modern, yeah, he's got no neck. He taps quick. That postures. That is a preposterous snack. I feel like if you had kicked him, he might die. Right. It's not, his head's not going to be attached. He snap that shit down. Look at that. Yeah. Jesus crazy. He's like a pit bull in that was the dark days right before that was the court. But when they were putting them in jail for rape, did he do it? What does that article say? If you have a no, I don't, I don't believe he did. I might be wrong, but that girl, um, she falsely accused someone of rape earlier. Oh yeah. If you have a thin neck, you're my most likely a Beta male. How about takeout? Most likely. How about just you are, you are a Beta male. Who's, who's out there running shit with a thin neck.

Speaker 1:          02:04:17       You can't be running. Shit been there. How could you be running shit with your mom's house? Got this guy. You probably hold that net guy. Damn long neck. What do you mean it's got the longest? Who's this guy? Oh, I thought I have seen that guy. Yeah, I thought you going to bring up that guy who's been in the Internet. Memes. The dude who's now fighting MMA. Black Guy who's neck starts at the top of his head and goes straight down here. He's got the craziest neck Evers. You said a weird neck. Oh, I thought it was just like distorted. Oh No. There's a bunch of pictures of this cat and was like, oh, they just did the thing. They didn't do. The thing do does a nutty neck. You know some girls have giant tits. This guy is just to neck. Yeah. I mean some people, huge hands. He's going to start fighting MMA. But where's he from? I Dunno. Probably Florida. I buddies from Florida. Look at it. Look at his neck.

Speaker 1:          02:05:13       He got arrested again. What does it say? When did he get arrested? The first one you look at as ne, well someone's going to teach them, but what is going on with that neck? That's his real neck. That is fucking crazy. That's like he's got a double neck. Maybe just a small job. Now that is a big neck. What are his parents look like? Um, I bet they have giant next to I put the chips off. Genetic mom. Mom's a thick old dog looking lady first please. Smoke shot showed off his really big neck this time he's not smiling so it's the thing. Same. So he's probably power lifter or something like that. Yeah. And plus got a fucked up neck.

Speaker 1:          02:05:54       No need to blow poor man's spot up. Just fucked up neck. But I take his neck over the skinny neck. No, you know I, maybe his neck is like genetically fucked up like that. And maybe the go with a skinny neck just doesn't work out like the situation. It's not, it doesn't bug me when somebody is just, they have, you know, slender neck. But when they go through so much trouble to look like an Alpha male, but they have that little chicken neck, right. And then they're posing like there, that's gotta be a big issue with you. Like as a woman, like the way you interact with men as a world champion, Muay Thai woman even figured that out. You have to have a hard time with the men. I bet you do. I do. Yeah. Yeah. Cause you need to get a real one, like a real, real, like that's the only way it's going to work. That it hasn't. Now imagine it's hard out there for a pimp. It is. Right. So I had is a great boyfriend, but we went out of country. We fought on the same card. He fought the day before me. I thought the next day during the fight he almost gets knocked out as this guy is mauling him. He goes like this.

Speaker 1:          02:07:11       What do you think? I was thinking.

Speaker 4:          02:07:14       Okay.

Speaker 1:          02:07:15       Um, not good dogs. The boyfriend, the boyfriend, my boyfriend was like this. Yeah. You didn't like it? Fuck now to turn you off. Oh my God, so much. Whoa. I was like, dude, you're getting fucked up and you drop you as you're falling to the canvas. You need, still need to go. Fuck you. So the way he was getting beaten was fucking with you. It wasn't just that he was getting beaten. I don't care if he wasn't like, take that shit. Yeah. Like you know, like a champ or like, or like a fighter, right? Yeah. You can't be like, wow, whoa.

Speaker 1:          02:08:02       Yeah. That was great. Maybe sometimes it's like that's the problem. It's at the balance. The ones who are not great boyfriends are the one that are going to turn you on because they're ruthless. Yeah. Yeah. It was like, I can, I can balance that shit. I got to be ruthless, gentle. Mm. I was like, I don't not. Well, I mean, I'm sure someone can sweet kale chips. It's great. Yeah. I get it. I don't get it. Some people can. Yeah. Yeah. But I mean, I think your requirements, particularly as a fighter, but going to be extraordinarily high as a world champion fighter. Yeah, yeah, yeah. It was was better off dating a guy who's like a navy seal or something who can't fight or maybe and fight, but he's not a fighter. He doesn't like it. Knows how to fight, but he's not, he's a killer.

Speaker 1:          02:08:57       He's not in there. Maybe like you could relate more. Yeah. I don't know. I think your dating has it. I'll try it out and I'll let you know. Well I've, I've, I've, I've noticed this, I mean except for the ones that are lesbians, I was looking at women who are fighters and I hope they're limited in their dating pool. Cause girls who are fighters, they don't want to date someone who can't fight. The last thing a girl wants who's like a professional fighter or if somebody was really smart, you know what, even if the guy is really smart because it, because then they like, as long as they asked me somewhere they have to really fuck. You're like, no, no. You could say that. You're trying to find a nice man. He was like, maybe I can compromise. No, you need a killer. No, it will.

Speaker 1:          02:09:46       It would've bothered me about that was like, you're a fighter, but you're not being a fighter. And I'm just like not savage enough. Well, you worried that if the shit hits the fan, that's what every woman is worried. If the shit hits the fan, what? How do you react? How do you react? And you don't really know until you see someone react when the shit hits the fan. And when you see the shit hitting the fan, you see them going, yikes. You're like, fuck, I can't count on you to, I think he would have been better outside of the fighting situation outside if the shit hit the fan. Oh. So it was definitely like writer's ego, like, Nah, dude, you need to have more bright than that. Well, how you do anything is how you do everything. Okay. All right. Maybe. Yeah, especially duress.

Speaker 3:          02:10:34       I mean, people make mistakes. People panic. People learn from those mistakes. I mean, there are people that fold in fights that come back way stronger and will never fold because they folded before and they felt it because you made a mistake. You know, you, you, you make a split second decision in the middle of a fight and you know, and something, something inside you, you, you, you, it exposes weakness that maybe you weren't prepared for the world to see. And then when you feel the pain of that weakness, you make a vow that you're never going to experience that again. That's entirely possible. I feel like mental strength is not, I don't think you either have it or you don't have it. I don't buy that shit. I think you can develop it. I think you can build it. And I think mental toughness and just the ability to persevere is something that you can cultivate a really believed that.

Speaker 3:          02:11:18       Absolutely. Absolutely. So maybe he needed to caleel shying away and feel you going, hey motherfucker, you know, when you get in the head, don't, don't do any of this shit. Maybe someone needs to hear that. So then when it's happening they go, fuck that. I'm not doing this anymore, and then they dig deep and step to the side or clench or do something. Go out like a warrior. Yeah. You know, or figure your way a better, better response to the situation. Then again, sometimes you get clipped in. Your neuromuscular system just goes up and everything's just off. It's just you're not responding right because your, your system's getting shot,

Speaker 1:          02:11:54       but it was more like, get away from me. That's not good. Yeah. I didn't like that, Miriam. We said two and a half hours flew by. It's four 30 that wasn't scary at all. It wasn't scary. I told you my friend, I'm going to take care of you. We're all good, man. Listen, what have you on again, when you have a fight scheduled and we'll pump that shit up. Okay, let me know when. Let me know what it is. Bare knuckle boxing, whatever maybe. Right. They're doing a lot of that. You've got to go to Wyoming and do it on a ranch or something. Right? Hey, well, does it pay well? Yeah, it does it way more real. I know somebody that did four rounds for 10,004 rounds for 10,000 yes. You say that like that's not, that's a lot of money for that. For, for just boxing. Four rounds about boxing. Bare knuckle. What did he break your hands? We'll talk. Tell people how to find you on Instagram, on Twitter, all that stuff. Oh, I'm Mary, I'm Nakamoto. Spell it out so people know. High R I a M Nakamoto. Okay. Hold on. Nakamoto Nakamoto. It's on my Instagram. She's linked. She'll be linked there. All right. Thanks man. Appreciate it.

Speaker 4:          02:13:09       Bye Buddy. Hi.

Speaker 1:          02:13:19       Hmm.
