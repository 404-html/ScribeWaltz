Speaker 1:          00:00:00       I'm not interested. Five, four, three, two, one.

Speaker 1:          00:00:08       Yes, we're live data. Yes. Russell, you going no headphones? You're radical. Well, you knew that dude. I'll take the headphones off with you. I don't give a fuck. Let's go. Bring it on. I feel better. I feel liberated. Not Know what the real sounded to look. Slim and healthy. What have you been doing? Thank you. I just, I got back in the gym and I'm doing boxing and kickboxing still and active. Yeah. Well, you know, you know I'm in Oregon a lot, so the meth is awesome up there. They do have good speed rate for weight control. I would think that Oregon would be more of like a calm down type of state as far as drugs. I was just there for four times. I emailed you. Yeah, I love it up there man. I would bet they're fucking the winter, so goddamn depressing, but I would still do it.

Speaker 1:          00:00:54       This winter has been just ridiculous. It's rained for nine months straight. There were like 500 inches in my county. Jesus this winter, but a beautiful green. Oh God. It's so lush when I just. When you get out of the PDX airport, it just, you smell pine trees as soon as you walk out of the airport. I mean it's amazing and after being an la, which is just basically like this giant desiccated Turd. I mean it's like, it's, it's so nice. Yeah. That would be like the best place to live. Like if you had a place there and a place here you go back and forth, you deal with total dry and total when I'm doing it kind of balance itself. Nailed it. Mr Russell. Thank you. You nailed it. I'm commuting every week and people say, yeah, don't you get sick of this? I actually love it so far, so far.

Speaker 1:          00:01:34       Yeah. So my son here, my son is here, he goes to school here. In fact he goes to school right near where we're sitting and uh, so I have an apartment here and then a house in Salem, Oregon and I love it. Going back and forth. I'm not, I'm kind of like a shark. I can't, I need to keep moving. I don't like I get, I feel claustrophobic and like the world is passing me by if I'm sitting in one place too long. Have you always been like that? I'm digging it. Yeah. Always. I always need to be doing something and moving. I get I am literally claustrophobic. Yeah. Yeah. And have you ever done an isolation tank? Oh my God. Yeah, I know when you talk about that I'm freaked out. That's my worst nightmare. Whoa. Like, and I'm also a little bit afraid of the dark.

Speaker 1:          00:02:12       I knew you were going to laugh at that. You're gonna. Call me a girl again. No. Wrong with being a girl by the way. How dare you? Oh yeah. Well we'll get into that. We'll get into that. No, uh, I mean like pitch black that, that freaks me out. I really can't see anything. I can't stand that. I don't mind a very dark room if you can. As long as I can see something. But if it's pitch black, I freak the fuck out. You know what freaks me out? Vision Goggles. Well, that's what I want right then. I'm cool if I hadn't seem so weird. They put them on. You feel like you're in a horror movie or you're in one of those scenes and most stupid ghostbuster shows where they're down in the basement. They always have night vision on. Yeah. Have you tried them on? Yes. Oh yeah. I have some. Of course you do. Of course you do. For like nighttime boar hunting over there, whatever it is. That is one of the reasons why they use them

Speaker 2:          00:03:00       for. Then it's scopes. They have night vision scopes or where you see the infrared version of the pigs moving around. It's very weird to look through them, but people often mistake other things for pigs like deer and not like that idea. I haven't tried them on, but I liked that idea, but you know like spelunking is definitely out for me. You know, claustrophobic and afraid of the dark spelunking caving. Oh yeah. It's like the idea of being like in a tight one of those tight little caves you have to like squeeze your body through in the pitch dark and your headlamp goes out. I was just listening to, it was my worst night, asked about this family that owns a ranch in Texas and they had these small caves and these kids would explore and, and then um, they allowed some cavers, some local, you know, cave explorers to go and check it out and they crawl through this really small, like three foot diameter hole, like literally crawled through it and found two football field size caves inside and then found out that there's literally miles of cave systems in there. Oh yeah. No, it's incredible. I wish I weren't terrified of it because I love all the other stuff in the outdoors and backpacking and camping and hiking. I do all that. I love it. But going underground is the worst thing. You only backpack and camp when it's a full moon.

Speaker 2:          00:04:17       A No, I'm cool with the stars. That's good enough. Good enough. Headlamps, like I said, it was pitch black when you can't see your hand in front of your face. That freaks me out and I don't understand why people, other people don't freak out about that. Like I'll wake up in a hotel room and I forgot to, or there's no light at all on for whatever reason, I'll freak out because I don't know where I am. See, look, look what I'm already admitting to millions of people. I just got here, man. I'm already like, I'm already like a girl and putting up your opening. You keep saying girls, if it's like a week thing that sparked me the first time I was here, he called me a girl. It's stuck with me. I'm sorry, I don't even remember it now. You just said you sounded like a girl just then.

Speaker 2:          00:04:54       Really, what did I say about. I can remember what it was about. I can't remember something. Something really critically. Pretty girlish pretty. So it's been um, portland, the Portland area. What are you doing up there? So my girlfriend, who I live with as a vice president at willamette university and I teach part time just for the hell of it at Willamette. But mostly I'm developing all these other things. And, and mostly just enjoying Oregon. So because man you can, you can afford a hell of a house in Salem, Oregon for what you were paying in La. Let me tell you. So we're just living a lot better. First Time in my life I've been in a house that I enjoyed being in and that's nice. Yeah. And so it's great and it's given me a base to do these projects, my new podcast and renegade university and write my book.

Speaker 2:          00:05:38       It's great. I have my own studio in the house and I have my own office in the house. So it's like kind of the command center up there. That's nice. Yeah. So it's been, it's been pretty awesome lately. I think it's fascinating how some places like some cities have like a mindset. There's a field that you get from the city and liked the field that you get from Portland. Yeah, I mean it's like it's a aware city, you know, and it's not a dumb city because they're aware they're woke woke as fuck. Yeah. But it's like a white, like a white bloke, white work, whatever. It might logos a little pretentious. I think somewhere along the line Portland became like a place that pretentious people gravitated to because they wanted to identify like, I'm white and I have dreadlocks. Here I am. You know what I mean?

Speaker 2:          00:06:24       Like they make really good food. Those pretentious people, their food carts or coffee. Yeah, yeah, yeah. They make great food and those food trucks are out of this world. Totally. Totally. Yeah. Portland is a great city, except have you noticed the hid all the black people this four or five of them? I've seen, I've only seen mountain lions. I keep waiting to like come across the cage where they keep them in the one corner of the city because then it's amazing. Especially in like the core of Portland, Maine part. All you do not see any black people. You don't see the Mexicans, you don't see Japanese people. It is just white people. Dude with beards. That's like a Pacific northwest selling coffee. You see more of it in. You definitely see more black people in, in Seattle. So it's definitely pretty diverse. Not fully, but a lot of Asian folks for sure.

Speaker 2:          00:07:08       But uh, yeah, Portland, I mean, not even, not even Latinos and Asians, like how do you do that on the west coast? Where do you put all those people? If you're on the west side, pass by there, just go with it. Let's keep going. Vancouver's right up the street. Hey you, you took a wrong turn. Keep going. Just keep walking. Let's just keep going north. Yeah. It's like it's, it's a small city. I mean I don't think Portland has more than a million people. Right. Does it now? I think it's like, it's like half a million. Is it really? I think something like that. Yeah, it's small. I know it. The lack of diversity actually is the only problem I have with it and it's a fairly big problem, but that's an issue. But otherwise it's the best city in America I think. Really. It's my favorite city in America.

Speaker 2:          00:07:48       Yeah, I should say. It was pretty. God damn good. Lawrence Krauss lives there I am. So there you go. Yeah, there's two of us to complete to. Cool people are smart people. I don't live in Portland, right? I live in Salem, which is an hour south, but we're still important that a lot, so it's kind of is that because of the university will and because it's way cheaper to live there and it's also really beautifully centrally located. So we've got. We're an hour and 10 minutes from the coast, which is gorgeous. Have you been to the Oregon coast? Yes. Amazing. Yeah. And then we're an hour and a quarter from the cascade mountains on the other side. And then all around Salem is the Willamette valley, which is like Napa Valley and Sonoma county meet Vermont. It is so beautiful. Just readily beautiful farmland all around there to make a lot of wine up there. Two incredible wine. The pinot noir is the best in the world. Yeah, but it's really pretty. Just driving through there, so. Whew man. That's. Yeah, I'm telling you, we have. Salem has Mexican, so we do have a little diversity because all the farm workers, there's a substantial population of Latinos. You have legit Mexican instead. We got in St Louis, uh, not like working on it. We're working on it. I mean, Salem has been like a dumpy town for a long, long time

Speaker 1:          00:08:56       until just recently. Um, and now it's starting to pick up. We got some stuff going on and we've been. Now we've got a good mma gym there. And a boxing gym just just opened. Legitimate. Yeah, like team quest people, former team quest people. What was the trainers? Nick Gilardi who's a, he actually came up with chill and randy couture, he was, he was trained as a wrestler by them when they were doing wrestling only when he was a kid and then he became a champion wrestler and then they went into fighting and he was like, okay, I'll do that with you. And he's a major sort of northwest mma fighter and now he's like, coach of the year in the northwest. Oh Great. He's my coach. We have a little image. It's really good mma gym in, uh, in Salem called impact. That's awesome. Impact Jujitsu. So your knee is.

Speaker 1:          00:09:37       We're talking about this before the podcast you need, feels like it's good enough. And I really would love to start grappling. I never have. And I'm scared of it because of all the takes, especially the take downs and you know, and the leg locks and all that. So I don't know, but I'm doing it. I'm still doing just standup boxing and, and um, and Moitai kick boxing. Have you ever done any yoga? Yes. Yes. It's great for me. Uh, I can help my knee. It will definitely help your name. I guess so. I mean stretching it, help. Just strengthening and strengthening. I mean just holding static positions like static yoga positions for your back and for your knees and your feet until this does. I'm a broken record with this shit. So I'll stop right now. Lost people. People listening to this podcast like Jesus is gonna fucking talk about yoga again.

Speaker 1:          00:10:21       I love it. Yeah. So we don't, we don't have to talk. No, no, no, that's, I'm all about that drink gatorade man. Cause I'm, I'm. This is not good for you. That's triggering. This is terrible for you that you might as well be drink because I get dry mouth around it. You scare me. I'm sorry. I'm just kidding. He's scared of the dark. Scared of scary looking at you, Mr. Muscles. Listen, now that you're all leaned out, you're scared of muscle people. Yeah. No, it's, um, it's, it's interesting place. It's a, it's a truly sort of like it's trump country, trump country. It's like, it's, it's dudes with beards who are not hipsters who drive pickup drugs real and have a lot of guns and um, they don't give a fuck basically. And it's sort of, um, it's not really a conservative socially conservative place is more of a kind of libertarian thing and basically this is my land, don't mess with me.

Speaker 1:          00:11:13       So it very much was the libertarian option kind of kind of, kind of. Most Libertarians hated him, so they would be better off with someone who's an actual libertarian like Ron Paul. He's type character. He's the only reason libertarians were attracted. Well, there's two reasons, but the main one was that they were attracted to him because during the campaign at least he was saying things that sounded like he was a non interventionist in foreign policy. Right. And that's why I was at least interested in him. I thought there was a possibility there. Of course he would like, you know, for 30 minutes he would talk like Ron Paul about foreign policy and then the last 30 minutes of his speech he would sound like an old republican about how you wanted to bomb the shit out of

Speaker 2:          00:11:54       people. So who knows. But now of course, I think what's happened is that the generals have taken over. I think establishment has just taken over. Well, it seems like there's, there's no way one person can run every single facet of being the president, especially not him. Yeah. And he's got 100 different businesses worldwide that are constantly ongoing right now. Anything about the world. So of course he's going to rely on experts and he also, we all knew this all along. He loves generals. He loves that thing. And I, I, it's pretty clear that madness came in there and just took over his mind. And um, he said, okay, yeah, I guess you, I was right about all that shit. Let's go. Essentially said I'm going to get out of their way and let the military do their job. Exactly. And like I know guys that are like re-enlisting because they're pumped.

Speaker 2:          00:12:39       They think that the military, like Tim Kennedy a UFC fighter, he reenlisted enlisted because he believes that the UFC forever, the UFC, he believes that the military now has the backing and the support from the president and that this is going to be great and they can do their job. Now. Kennedy, one to, uh, serve in combat because he really was. He really wants to go to oil and possibly die. Oh yeah. He's doing that right now because he believes in the car. Does he belong to percent? Yeah. Where? Which part? I talked to him about it. Isis. What does he want? He wants to kill his. He's about Isis. Oh Dude. It gives his address out to isis. Puts his address on the Internet. Says fine. Come get me. I'd love to talk to Tim Kennedy. Yeah. It's a long conversation though. I bet you would want six hours.

Speaker 2:          00:13:22       That's fine. You would want to take pee breaks and drink water. And this. Let's get into this from top to bottom. I would love to want this smoothed out. CNN. Seven minute presentation in between two talking heads on either side. You don't want that. You want the long form. Who is Tim Kennedy had? Why? Why does Tim Kennedy feel this way? And that's what I will do. An experience that's my podcast, unregistered podcast. That's what we do. And it's, it's kind of a, yeah, that's precisely what we're doing. I'm interested in people's personal histories and how it's connected to their current ideas, right? The roots of their political ideas, where do they come from? So it requires people who are self aware about themselves and a lot of, a lot of people aren't, but so far my guests are people who really have a sense of the connections between what happened in their childhood and the early development and, and what they're thinking now.

Speaker 2:          00:14:11       It's a really interesting thing if you can get people to do that, to connect those things, to weave them together. So if Tim Kaine, I mean Tim Kennedy might know, uh, where his ideas about serving in the military come from other than, you know, my dad did it or, or whatever it was. But that's what I'm interested in doing. So and this form like what you're doing here, the long form. I love it. It's so much better. I think this is why I've know a lot of people didn't know me. I take most of the people who know me know me from my podcast appearances here and elsewhere have been on a lot of podcasts and I just, I, I'm just more comfortable with it. I just think it's the best way to go. I hate being on cable news where it's like, you know, two minutes or 30 seconds and get this complicated idea out right then and that's it.

Speaker 2:          00:14:51       And even radio have done a lot of radio which just sucks, you know, it's the same thing. Twenty second sound bytes, even 20 minute interviews. I always find frustrating either as an interviewer or as a guest, even our long interviews. Oh totally. I did an interview with Ron miscavige is the father of data and we only did an hour and a half and I was like, if we did like three or four hours, I probably get deeper and deeper into the student and find out, well, yeah, that's it. That's what you do. So you go kind of, you're always going in and out of people's personal histories and their psychology and then into their ideas and into big abstract stuff. And then history and philosophy and science, right? You're going in and always back and forth and ended up connecting those things, weaving together. That's. I love that.

Speaker 2:          00:15:32       I think it's the only way to go. You get the deepest understanding of people and it's, it sort of makes it impossible to do what most people do is, which has just put people in a little box and throw them away. Right. Dismissed, you know, oh, he's a libertarian, oh, he's a socialist or whatever, dawn. Right. Um, so you know, he's Joe Rogan. Oh, he's the UFC guy. Gone, right? And I'm sure people do that to you all the shore, or he's Joe Rogan, the masculine macho dude not interested by, right. Everyone is so complex. Um, most people are and most people are not the same person who they were. If you're pulling a quote from them from two years ago or five years ago or whatever, I'm just not that person anymore. Everybody evolves. Exactly. And you can box someone into some sort of a corner by like, not to defend them, but the, grab them by the Pussy speech from 2005 for example.

Speaker 2:          00:16:19       It's your boxing, a guy in the corner who's trying to make another guy laugh on a bus and he's just being gross. Greg's. And then you take that and go, is this the guy who won for president? Right. Yeah. We can talk about that a lot. I mean, I'm with you on that when I heard you talking about that the other day. But yeah, it's the trump. I have a lot to say about that. But um, it's, um, so anyway, I think the podcasting thing, it's changing the game and it's, it's so great. It gives people something to do while they're doing other stuff. Totally. I think we're like 90 percent audio, only downloads versus youtube, somewhere, somewhere in route. So most people are either listening during the commute or while they're at the gym or a lot of people even at work, they'll put on headphones while they're doing mindless bullshit, but I think what it does is it humanizes people, right?

Speaker 2:          00:17:07       You get, you get not the full humanity of a person of course, but you get much more of who they are really and the complexities of them and so people talk about how we are all being siloed now because of the Internet. Right? That we just go to the websites we do that agree with us and there's a lot of that for sure. Certainly, but I think there's. I actually think the overall effect is just the opposite. I actually think that we have much deeper understandings of people who are not like us because of things like this. Right? I mean, because of the podcasts and because there's just much more exposure to people's ideas and personalities and there's. There's more people talking in public, by the way, I mean, just imagine that, right? Like in the 19 seventies and eighties when you and I were growing up, there were three broadcast that all

Speaker 1:          00:17:49       said the same thing on the new shows. There were three also said the same thing because the FCC wouldn't allow any competitors to come into the market. I mean they just wouldn't allow it. And then Rupert Murdoch broke that open. Right? And then since then it's just been flooded. So now we have how many channels, how many networks? I'm going to end up podcasts and so when I was coming up as an academic in the nineties, if you didn't, if your book didn't get reviewed in the New York Times or if you're an author of any kind and your book didn't get reviewed in the New York Times, you were not going to make a living as a writer. That was it. You had to get reviewed in the New York Times and it had to be a positive review. That was the only gatekeeper to success as an author.

Speaker 1:          00:18:29       Now the New York Times is one of, you know, a hundred different places are a thousand different places that matter when you're writing books. My book renegade history, the United States was ignored entirely by the New York Times and I know why, but it didn't really matter. People fly. Oh, because it says all the things you're not supposed to say if you're a good liberal left liberal by coastal elite person from university. Like, like, um, Martin Luther King was a conservative and hated black culture, you know, like. Yeah, yeah, yeah. He was a very conservative person culturally, and he was basically an opponent of black culture. He, he didn't, he was opposed to rock and roll. He didn't, he didn't even mention jazz until the 19, late, late into his career. And only once he thought black people should sing classical music, European classical music or, or Gospel, you know, very respectable, very Christian, very good citizen kind of stuff.

Speaker 1:          00:19:24       And he hated the flamboyant black preachers who were hooping and hollering in the, in their churches and speak in black dialect. He wanted every, all black people to speak, correct American English. Um, he was opposed to a lot of dancing that was going on. He just, all this stuff that we love in black culture, Martin Luther King was opposed to, it wasn't because he was just an uptight, puritanical prick. It was because of his strategy and his objective, which was to seek full citizenship. Right. And he understood right? In a way it wasn't his fault entirely. You have to prove yourself always in this country historically that you are just like white people to get all the good stuff to get the vote to get equal protection under the law. So that's what his mission was. Assimilation, assimilation has always been the ticket to full citizenship man.

Speaker 1:          00:20:14       It's just, it sucks that that's even a thought that the only way to achieve quote unquote full citizenship is to ignore all the things that make black culture special. Like comedy, like Jazz, like rap, like just, just slang, just all the cool shit that black people have figured out. Like the things to say that white people have ruined. Like bro, bro used to be like a cool thing. Oh yeah, black people say to each other and now it's like an insult for a like a frat dummies a bro. Now we'll just think about like, thinking about America now, if black people had never been here, what would it be like? Which I'm not sure I'd want to live here. We wouldn't even have blues. So like what kind of musical we have. Blues is the roots of all pop music, but all music comes out of blues.

Speaker 1:          00:21:06       Everything that's pop music that's not European. Classical music has comes from black people. Original roots basically. Of course whites were involved in it, you know, of course all that music but, but all that stuff, the roots of it are in this lives. It will even European rock, like led Zeppelin will. They borrowed it. Those guys asked the Beatles. They talked about this stuff. The stones, you talked about it all the time. They like a, you know, we're not, we are not the rolling stones without muddy waters. Of course. Les said it to all of that sort of stemmed from. It's fascinating when you really think about. So that's the whole history of. That's African American history actually is a ordinary black people who aren't interested in being just like white people and doing their thing, you know, since slavery, I'm just doing their thing and being called niggers by whites and also, and this is what people don't know, civil rights leaders since slavery, like black political leaders who wanted citizenship, attacking them for their culture just as harshly as the Ku Klux Klan did.

Speaker 1:          00:22:07       And I'm not exaggerating if you look at what Frederick Douglas said about slave culture, if you look at what Web Dubois sometimes said about slave culture and black culture than Martin Luther King, a Philip Randolph, Jesse Jackson, Al Sharpton, all the way through, they are saying the harshest nastiest things about black working class, popular culture you could imagine. But again, it was for this reason, they wanted to convince whites that we are just like them. So they'll let us in the. Let us sit at the table of America. They'll give us the vote. We can then become president. And so guess what happened? They finally, a guy came along who was black looking, but who, who lived in this perfect nuclear Christian family wife, two kids didn't drink, didn't do drugs, he smoked, but he stopped smoking pretty quickly. Right? Very dignified, spoke perfect English. Right? And guess what happened? He became our first black president.

Speaker 1:          00:23:13       So Obama is absolutely the apotheosis is a good academic word. He's the pinnacle. He's the, he's the full achievement of that long attempt by civil rights leaders, black political leaders to assimilate blacks and they won in that way. They got a president. But what else did they win? Right? And doing that. Not much. I mean race relations. Now, are they better now? Not really. Do Black people still say stuff in their hip hop songs that is not respectable even more than ever. Um, and white people or black people are thinking when they're doing their hip hop songs, they're not thinking that they're representing. All black people are thinking they're representing their vision right there, representing what they see on the street, what they see in their neighborhood. Exactly. Yeah, exactly. That's always going to be the case, right? The people. This is the thing, you know, I mean people who actually are from those neighborhoods, you know, where there really aren't any white people, you know, if they're from the projects are, they're from, you know, these poor black neighborhoods that are famous, right?

Speaker 1:          00:24:14       I mean by and large, and we know this from what they say in their art, you know, don't give a shit about what white people think about them, right? They're not interested in citizenship. They're not interested in being good Americans. They're doing their thing, as you just said. I mean, they're interested in represent seems to me they're interested in representing their aspirations and their interested in having a good time, which sounds trivial to a lot of people, but it's actually revolutionary, right? If you just, if you're interested only in having a good time and pleasure and succeeding and achieving things for yourself, that's actually not American because you're not interested in America. You're interested, interested in yourself. So that's a person who's very unlikely to volunteer like Tim Kennedy to go serve in the military. Right? It's very unlikely that that person will become a cop.

Speaker 1:          00:25:00       It's unlikely that that person will obey the laws, will obey the, the, the actual laws and then the cultural laws. They're not going to be good Americans. They're out for themselves and I think that's actually always historically for more than 200 years provided this alternative for white people. We've always looked at that like with this sort of Split Lens, like part of it says, Goddamn, look at those. Look at those primitive black people. They do. They're doing the bad stuff. We were not like them. We're better than that and always simultaneously, most or many white people have looked at and said, hm, that looks. That looks more fun than what we're doing. Maybe we'll do that for a while. Certainly young white, suburban kids that grow up in these safe, sheltered environment, it's always adopt that sort of a radical bad ass black rapper, sort of listening to their music, wearing their pants low, like sag and doing all that stuff.

Speaker 1:          00:25:56       Coopting various aspects of black culture that seemed to be dangerous. You know who you just described who? My son. Oh No, no. Don't say, oh no, it's good as you sagging. I'm saying I'm pro wigger, son sags. They don't sag anymore. This is the new thing is these ripped jeans. That's hip hop style chips. Genes behind the top, kind of like fitted. They don't sag, but they're like just shredded almost like an eighties look. And I said, I said to my son, I said, I said, you know, back in the eighties, like we laughed at those genes but for a totally different reason and now that's the coolest thing that black people were. Oh, so he's doing all that. He's. He is fully immersed. He is. He studies rap lyrics. He knows all that stuff. How old is he? He's making beats. He's 15. Yeah. So

Speaker 2:          00:26:44       it kind of martial arts, queer kind of see why train? I'm saying no, he refused. Really? I tried to get them in there a couple times. Good for discipline that Joe Schilling and I think that scared scared of me when I met Joe. Scary Dude was my first gym. I walked in the first day and I had never done anything like that and I walk in and there was job and I was like, okay, if people like that are going to be doing this, I'm not. I'm not having any part of this name is just terrifying, but when you get to know him, he's a teddy bear. He's awesome and big old sweet. Awesome. Great coach. Great Guy. Yeah. Yeah. I love. Just think for a young boy, like it's a great way to sort your head out. I think life is so I. If I didn't find martial arts when I was that age, who the fuck knows what started when I was.

Speaker 2:          00:27:24       I was just thinking about this. I started when I was 41. Wow. Yeah. I took my suffering is doxing lesson when I was 41. Wow. How's Your Double Jab? Church street really took off the job. Oh yeah. Hell yeah. If you started at 41. Yeah. Got some speed to it. Yeah. Yeah. I got a good job. Really? Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Interesting. Told this tall guy. I got some holes in my game. Think about Klitschko a Joshua. This weekend's during fight pouring. Those guys are boring. Joshua's got nice job, was not boring. He's. He's got great power. Is Techniques okay? He's not great. I think Klitschkos got a nice jacket, put people to sleep. So this is why the heavyweight division, no one cares about it, right? People to sleep the other way by being boring and being not silly, but Joshua puts people to sleep. Josh, he knocks people out, which is fun to watch and I'm into that, but it's not.

Speaker 2:          00:28:12       I like, I just love technique. Like I'm a student, so like Loma Chenko Guy. So thank you for bringing La Loma. Thank you for bringing him up. We got to talk about this. Forget my career podcast. History. Fuck all this shit. Who Don't know. Go on right now. And Google Vasiliy Loma Chenko. He might be the best boxer that's ever lived. He might be. So I was worried about that. We were going to fight about this, but I think we're on the same page here. So he's on such another level. So I footwork and movement. I just can't come up with a comparable. I mean there's been some amazing boxers way back to sugar ray Robinson and Willie pap and all those guys paved the way, but I feel like everything evolves, right? Every combat sport, even art and music evolves to the current state it's at now, which you get the best of the best right now and you go, wow.

Speaker 2:          00:29:01       They've learned from Ali and Sugar Ray Leonard and Roy Jones and Bernard Hopkins and Loma Chenko is in my eyes, is the best way he moves is insane. Yeah, and he's super aggressive. He's not like floyd mayweather who is arguably the best ever, you know, multiple time world champion in multiple divisions. Forty nine in. Oh, only been like hit solid maybe seven, eight times his whole salary once when he got a little rock by Shane once and then my donna cracked him once, but that's like over the course of this spectacular career, but much more defensive oriented, brilliantly defensive, very economical with this approach, but brutal hands hurts them, hurts his hand, breaks his hands a lot. Not a lot of power. Loma Chenko is on you like glue stands right in front of you and you can't hit him. And he's going left and he's going right and he's in and he's out and you don't know where the fuck he is and he's lightening you up.

Speaker 2:          00:29:57       So what does this. Here's why Wassily Lemme check goes. Now the number one pound for pound fighter in boxing. What's that in Forbes? Damn, for. Technically he can't be because his record, he doesn't. He hasn't really been tested. He goes, no, no, no, I'm, I'm with you completely. I'm just saying technically he doesn't have enough fights. I don't give a fuck to be number one. I know he's the best. So let me just say so here's my history. Let me try again so I can figure. It was like four or five years ago I thought Gary Russell Jr was the greatest thing since sliced bread and I still think he's just phenomenal. Incredibly fast. The fastest hands since Roy Jones easily and maybe even faster, just technically just perfect. I thought he was unbeatable. I thought he was the next thing and he's still great. Great. Great fighter. I love him.

Speaker 2:          00:30:39       He fought Lemme check on. I was like, who's this Russian dude? I don't even know. He's your cranium. Never heard of him. And he took. He took russell apart. Yeah. Here's a highlight reel. Look it. He stands right in front of people. Man. He just has such brilliant movement, man. I mean, he's like the perfect example of like the new wave like this state right there. What do you want this side to movement? Yeah, he does this. He does this. It's a hop. Actually. He hops inside and he'll throw a body shot off of it when it gets inside on you, but he's basically standing at your side. Boom. Like right there. I did it again. It's not like a brutal puncher. He'll step in or hop in and you know, the funny thing is, so I've been hopping around Jim's lately, boxing gyms. He's, he did it like three times in a row and here's how.

Speaker 2:          00:31:26       Here's how I know. Here's always there. Here's why I think that he is the next Ali, which is that just in the last year, every boxing gym up, gone to. People have taught Loma Chanko moves like as a standard part of classes. Interesting. Right? Meaning that he's changing the game. Right? It's Kinda what you were saying. Well, you know Mike Tyson did a lot of that too, by the way. People can to this lunch is hard as Mike Tyson. You can actually do some of this stuff. Of course. He's a phenomenal athlete. Loma Chanko is, and not everyone can do this, but there are some things here that you can do that had never been done before. Like in particular, that little hop step. It's actually, I had a coach call it the, I think it was called the Loma Chieko jump or something, but you can do that. You can. You can just step in like that really quickly, but people for some reason just never did it.

Speaker 2:          00:32:12       Well, Tyson did do it. Tyson learned it from customer. No, custom motto was teaching this way back in the fifties, but his, his style was Mike Tyson style was so much different because he was throwing howitzers at you. It's Loma Chanko is not knocking anybody out with one punch. No, no. He's hitting you with multiple barrage of punches, but the thing about they dropped him with a liver shot, but the thing about like what Loma Chanko is doing with this steady barrage is very similar to what I've always said about Jujitsu. Like if you want to really learn Jujitsu Jujitsu from a small man because small men can't use strength and weight and all the physical advantages they have to use perfect technique. So if you deal with guys like Eddie Bravo or Heuler gracie or a Barrett Yoshida, like the really little guys are the guys who have this stellar techniques because they don't have the physical strength with Loma Chanko, you've seen the same thing.

Speaker 2:          00:33:05       He's not a one punch guy. He doesn't have like some Tommy hearns Nacada ability or Mike Tyson type power, so he's forced to have this brilliant movement and footwork which is complete next level. The footwork I think is the best of all time and now he's literally embracing the whole idea of him being in the Matrix. Has Matrix shorts on now. See, I like the matrix comparison. I think of him as the nightcrawler. Like, you know, he's just teleporting around you. He's just, he just shows up suddenly right next to him. Right. He disappears and shows up right next to you in a different location there that, that little movement and the anticipation of the counter and already been to three steps ahead of you. That last fight against Sosa. Yeah, I saw that. That was even better. Even he improved. He was even better. I was like, this is getting crazy.

Speaker 2:          00:33:51       Like it's so amazing. Everyone should watch him. He's, he's on another level man on a complete nother level. So yeah, for this, a guy like him and kickboxing who? Giorgio Petrosyan, Georgia patrols and he's my best for sure. Yeah. This is some next level shit too. Definitely. Yeah, I think so. He did lose one fight by knockout a couple of years ago, but yeah. Badly by Daniel Lee logos and rusty and rusty, that's what it was. Yeah. Well risk is a brutal knockout punch or knocked out a van. Rhys Millen to same year I think. Well, it's one of those things where a guy like any university has so much power. If he catches a human being on the chin, not perfect technique, but men, but nasty, nasty power. Yeah. I wanted to talk about Jermaine to randomly. Oh yeah. Talking about her. I mean, because, uh, it's funny that we're talking about fighting.

Speaker 2:          00:34:36       I'm so happy I want to do well. This podcast really, you know, I don't know. It's not real format to it. We've all noticed joe millions of us and notice what is great about it. Uh, it wasn't going to say no. I mean, I, um, it's funny. I think the first time I was on here a couple of years ago, I said at the end that I wanted to be a surfer. Deep Down, you know, like I love what I do and being a historian, all this stuff. But deep down I wanted to be a surfer. Now I don't want to be a surfer. I want to be a boxing coach. Really? Yeah. I really do. A lot of people that are intellectuals, a lot of people that live on almost like a sedentary lifestyle because you're constantly in front of books or computer screens. They long for this sense of adventure, I want to be a backpack or I want to go to Nepal and most most academics, and maybe this is one of the reasons I had to leave that profession or I'm trying to leave that profession, is that I've always been a physical person to. I've always been, you know, just in touch with my body in various ways. I've always been into sports, playing them and doing stuff. I just, you know, and most academics I'd say or least a lot of them seem

Speaker 1:          00:35:38       to be completely cut off from their bodies. They just don't care what's below the neck. Uh, they don't care what they wear, they don't care how they feel. They certainly don't care. They look many of them and they don't talk about the body. They don't talk about things like this ever. And in full they looked down on it. The problem is the looking down on it. I think that's very shortly this conversation right now we had about boxing. If you just took that clip that last 10 minutes and you put that in front of and you sent that to every historian and the country, I mean, my reputation will be done. I mean, it's already pretty much done yet. Are you serious? Are you serious? I appreciate box. I love talking to people who aren't from that world. When I tell them about these things and they're like, oh, of course that couldn't be.

Speaker 1:          00:36:14       It's not that bad. Well, what a silly world that is. Then it's bad. They would think less of me. Well, um, but yeah, no, I want to be a boxing coach. I'm not, I definitely. Yeah. Yeah. I mean I don't know if I can really make it happen professionally, but you know, at least on the side, you know, we'd have to have a couple fights. So anything. That's what I'm wondering. I don't know. I mean, I certainly can't coach pros, but I mean I'm talking about people sort of like at my levels, people who spar maybe, maybe some amateur fighters. I mean, I'm working like a little bit with a guy in my gym who's trying to be an amateur boxer now, but I'm not his coach. I'm just saying I'm sort of like trying to see because he's brand new to this point. Um, and I just love it.

Speaker 1:          00:36:52       I love it. I love teaching, I love teaching and that's the thing about academia that have always just loved. And that's why I entered it because I just felt like I was, it was just natural for me teaching people things. Teaching is fun, man. If you're good at it, but most people are not. Yeah. Right. So when you teach Jujitsu, right? I mean, what you're doing is, and this goes for anything. If you're teaching how to fix a bike, right? You take, you're taking all these complex ideas and this is what you're a master at a. You take all these really complex ideas and you package them, you, you break them down into little bite sized components and then hand them over to the person, right? You give them so that they can consume it and understand it instead of just saying, oh, that's the Japanese necktie.

Speaker 1:          00:37:28       Go ahead do it. Right. Which is what you'll see a lot of teachers do. Here's how. Here's how you do a Japanese necktie. Now go ahead and do it right. You're like, okay, no, the elbow goes here. I mean a lot of Jujitsu instructors do this too, of course. But like you know, the elbow goes right here, an inch down there and then the knees here and then. Right and so it's. But it's just like what I do, I mean, you take these really complex abstract concepts, you know that and you give them back to two people who are completely new to them. You have to, you have to package it. Not, not dumb it down, but distill it right? You have to like bring the, the essential components down and get rid of all the extraneous stuff and then just hand it over to them and this is a very clear, simple way. And then you can give them, give them the next part and then you connect that and then you connect that and next thing you know, they have this new radical concept of Martin Luther King or they can do a Japanese necktie. That's what separates someone who's a really good teacher versus someone who has maybe some real skill at something but isn't good at communicating here. Like breaking it down into a system, like a step by step progression system. Yeah. My coach I was talking about in Salem, Nick Gelardi, I've got

Speaker 2:          00:38:35       to give them a shout out because he's awesome. He's one of the best. What's that? I said powerful nick. Yeah, he is. Yeah, he is. He, um, he's one of the best coaches I've ever seen because he, he's really a coach's coach. Like he really cares about coaching and teaching. He really cares about teaching. And that's what he does. I could stop. He'll. So he said he was at team quest guy. He comes down. So Robert Follis, who is also an awesome coach who know he was, he started out with them and now he's a, he's extreme coture now. Yeah, he's worked with a lot of like top level guys, but yeah, I mean that's when the sport was being invented by. Sure. Yeah, so he was at the beginning of that as a kid with Dan Henderson, Matt Lindland, you know, randy coture, but I think it's just that I don't think it's about his context.

Speaker 2:          00:39:15       I think it's about who he is as a person just like me. It's like it's not. No one trained me to be a teacher. Like when I was in, when I was taking, when I entered college, I had no idea was going to be a teacher, but I remember sitting in his college classes that kind of weren't very good and I remember that I'd spent a lot of my time thinking about how I would teach this differently than this guy was teaching it. And then I realized, oh wait, I just, I, I'm actually studying the teaching more than the subject itself, how to communicate these ideas. I was studying more than the subject itself and then I just do. It dawned on me finally. I was like, oh, well that means you probably should be a teacher. And when I finally started doing it in graduate school at Columbia, I was teaching, you know, philosophy actually.

Speaker 2:          00:39:55       And yeah, I just, I loved it. It was just my passion. Do you find that? Will is you teach things that it helps you better understand them too because you go over them from a real fundamental perspective? Precisely. Precisely. Right, so you don't. And that was the first thing I learned when I started teaching was that I thought I knew plato really well, you know, until I started, until I knew that I had to teach him the next day and I was like, oh, wait a minute. I didn't quite actually get that connection there between those two ideas in his book, you know? Yeah. You have to. I tell my students this all the time. I said, you need to be as comfortable, so comfortable with this text that you can teach it to your roommate who's never read it before. That means what that means is you have to think all the way through the ideas.

Speaker 2:          00:40:37       You have to go all with your mind all the way through the ideas and then come back through them. Right. It's just like it's like martial arts or anything else, like you have to actually do the Japanese neck necktie all the way through and come back all the way through it and then you can teach it all the way through taekwondo career I taught. I taught at Boston University. I taught my own school. I taught classes. I taught the entire time. It's one other way. I made a living. I didn't know that and it helped me tremendously. It helped me understand it and I didn't realize how much it helped me until I started doing Jujitsu and I watched other people who started teaching Jujitsu just jump ahead by leaps and bounds from where they were. A good example is my friend Brent, he was a like a purple belt and he was always like a certain level, kind of a static level and then not static, but you know improving, but nothing crazy.

Speaker 2:          00:41:31       It was like everybody else. Right. What? Jujitsu is hard. It takes a long time to get better and you're around other people that are also getting better, so it's hard to look really measure, you know, but then he started teaching and teaching full time and then all the sudden I would roll with him and I'd be in great danger and I be like, Jesus and I had a conversation with them once, after a training with them, like, dude, I don't know what the fuck you're doing, but your, your game has jumped like four or five steps ahead. Like I feel like I'm the same as I was six, seven months ago. And he was like years ahead and he said it was all just teaching. And, and I remember now that that was the first time I really felt confident as an intellectual, you know, as when you were teaching the subjects at once I had taught them, it was like, oh, now I actually feel I was always. I mean everybody's wracked with insecurity and especially in graduate school about these things. You know, everybody feels like an imposter because we all, there's all, all of us have, you know, 500 bucks that everyone else has read that you should have read that we haven't read.

Speaker 2:          00:42:28       And I came from this little dip shit college in Ohio and I was like a c student in high school, so I had an extra insecurity, but once I started teaching it and forcing myself to, as you said, like learn the thing all the way through it and master it and then teaching it, that's when I felt, oh yeah, I belong here. I get it. I really do have some solid understanding of plato now and I really, I really can do this thing. You know, it's interesting that you're saying that because that's a big issue with comedians too. And like as they're becoming successful, especially they feel like frauds. Like everybody I know says that I've said it. Everybody I know that's sort of like started to make it like as they're starting to headline and go on the road places and do television sets and things along those lines.

Speaker 2:          00:43:11       Do you feel like a fraud when you're successful? Yes, I feel like a fraud. You like, I'm, you know, because you'll look at yourself and then you'll look at, you know, a Dave Chappelle or someone else, Chris Rock and you're like, well, I'm a fucking fraud. I'm a fraud. I'm not that guy. I'm a fraud. I'm not Richard, Jenny, I'm a fraud. And then I'm sure it takes a long time before you feel comfortable enough to say, I know what I'm doing in academia. It's called the Charlatans Syndrome, right? We all feel like we're charlatan. I think it exists in everything. Everything difficult. I'm not surprised and I think it's also probably a hallmark of someone who cares. Yeah, absolutely. That's what makes you better. Yeah. Yeah. I don't think every academic has that, but I think those who do are the ones who were interesting and get better.

Speaker 2:          00:43:53       I think the worst would be the opposite. Someone who's like super confident way before their time. Yeah, that's what I mean. Yeah. They're going to suck. There's a lot of that too though, right? Yeah. A lot of weirdness in academia, man. No kidding. I can't imagine the stuff that you guys go through politically. Oh my God, because just you saying that you couldn't talk about boxing because you would be thought of as a fool. So that's the thing. I know you're really interested in this and I am too and I'm the. There are some misconceptions and that. Well, I shouldn't say their misconceptions. I would say that there's a distortion of what's going on and this is not to say it's, it's

Speaker 1:          00:44:32       actually to say that it's worse than you think it is. So what most people who are outside of academia think is going on is not quite what's going on. We think it's something worse. Well, I know because I've heard her do. You have lots and lots of other people talk about and it's not your fault at all because you're not there and all you do is get the media reports about it. So I think what most people, I get it from Gad sad and Jordan Peterson or professors, they end day. If you listen to them, actually they will. They themselves. We'll talk about it a little differently, but people still consume it differently because the news right is all about the crazy thing that the 18 year old said at Wesleyan or whatever, or it's not the 18 year old. It's the 45 year old sometimes the 45 year old.

Speaker 1:          00:45:09       Yeah. Okay. But here's the. So that stuff that really sort of loony stuff, you know, that you hear coming out or protest, you know, people saying that they are, I'm going to die because you said a word that happens. It does. That's all true. It's all there. I've seen it, but I've seen it maybe at most one time a year in the colleges where I've been. Maybe not even less than that. Okay. What is. And if it were just that, that's not actually a big deal. It's much worse than that. What's what's worse is that if there is a self censorship going on that's universal and profound, constant omnipresent. Like for instance, you know, I never talk about my love for boxing around academics or I'm very careful if I do, but it's not even that. It's that we know that there are certain things that can't be set on a college campus and so we just don't say them, therefore there's no need to police us.

Speaker 1:          00:46:11       There's no need to yell at us and screaming us in protest and what's the motivation for the for which are the people that are holding back on thoughts that maybe they would normally express. Okay. Well here's what I think it is for the senior faculty who have tenure, meaning lifetime appointments, cowardice. That's all it is. I think they're cowards. Yeah. If you are an adjunct like me with no job security or if you're an assistant professor up for tenure and if you don't get tenure, you have no career. I don't blame them. I get it. That's what I've done too. I police myself because you have to to stay in the game. If you have tenure, lifetime appointment, you're a senior professor. You make the decisions there on curriculum, hiring and firing and tenure. The faculty make those decisions and you don't challenge these crazy ideas in any way.

Speaker 1:          00:46:58       Or if you police yourself, you stop yourself from saying things that you think are right that you believe in. You're a coward. I'm sorry. Those people are cowards. I've seen it. It's just overrun by cowards. Yeah, yeah, yeah. No, I mean this. They are very though. So here's the thing. I can't prove this. This is just, I'm just saying this is, this is my belief, but I think it's pretty well informed because I've been around these people a long time and in part I share this, the, I think the worst fear of all those people is being called a or a sexist publicly. I think that is their version of being in a cave, crawling on their bellies in the pitch black. I think that's their worst. Fear it and for not. It's not entirely irrational, right? You can, you know, you will be publicly shamed.

Speaker 1:          00:47:47       You will. The whole campus will think you're a racist even if you're not. Um, it might even make the media and then pump and then the whole world thinks you're a racist. For a minute, but you're not going to lose your job if you have tenure, you know, a year, unless you actually did say it did say something that's truly racist. Um, it's just cowardice. I think that's what we need. We need those professors, the ones with the power and I'm talking about they have absolute power on these campuses, right? These aren't even like politicians. You have to go up for a vote. They, they're there forever unless they basically killed somebody, you know, they need to stand up now. People like Jordan Peterson and I have major differences with him on sort of the content of his ideas. Uh, not about academia but on academia. He's right completely and I'm totally in solidarity with him, what they did to him and what they're doing to him.

Speaker 1:          00:48:36       Uh, we need more people like him standing up and saying, no, I'm going to say what I want in my classrooms and on twitter and in because that's. People have been punished for that too. Was it trying to get him to stop doing is youtube black rhino, which is fascinating because they're very measured. Their long form. He gets to expand on his thoughts as much as he likes. He's very, very informed. I again, I, I have major disagree. What is the disagreement? Disagreements with him on gender and postmodernism. I think he's completely off, but you know how solid and so, so he, and I know you agree with him on this. I think, well maybe, I don't know. I'm not sure, but you know, it's this idea that there just are two genders. That's it. And they're good. Okay. He seems to think that I'm.

Speaker 1:          00:49:29       So. I think there's a spectrum of humans in every single aspect of being a person I should say. I heard your conversation with them and I could see, and this was interesting, it was exciting because I could actually see you moving in a direction that I found to be much more interesting than his, which is closer to mine, which is, yeah, that it. This, it's fluid feminine men. There's masculine women there. Thailand, Thailand, in fact. Speeding. Here we go. Merging all these topics together. One of the top Moitai fighters recently, I don't know if she's still fighting, is a ladyboy in Thailand. Well, once she became, once you got the operation, her performance dropped off pretty radical. Sure. But that's just the lack of a Felon Fox, so I agree with you there. So here's the thing. Okay. That's a different story. I totally agree with you on that particular thing. Right? Whether she should have been allowed to fight. Well, it's not that she should have been allowed to fight. I think she should be allowed to fight women as long as the women know that she used to be a man. That's fine. Tim was, for the first two fights, she didn't disclose it because she said it was a medical procedure

Speaker 3:          00:50:28       and she didn't have to give up the personal details of her medical procedure. I say, that's bullshit, right? I say, well, you're dealing with a chromosomal issue. You're dealing with the fact that you have a different bone structure. Yes. Different mechanical advantages and 30 years of testosterone in your body. It's just not the same. Exactly, but as long as someone knows. Look, I'm fine with drained Germain de Randamie. She knocked out a man. I don't know if you ever saw this, but she's. She's just, she's not choose to fucking bad ass. Fucking bad ass. I mean, I don't know if she's taking anything in her entire career. It would just be pure speculation. She doesn't look like she has. That doesn't mean anything either. Right? Right. But she's so fucking bad ass and so tactical and so tough. I know she's fought men, but she knew there were a man going in.

Speaker 3:          00:51:11       She made a decision just like, I think you should be allowed to sky dive, just like I think you should be allowed to ride bulls. I don't think it's smart, but you should be able to do whatever the fuck you want to do. I'm all for freedom of expression of participation in any sort of dangerous activity. My issue 100 percent was that people were trying to pretend that there's no advantage whatsoever and that's crazy. That's silly. So the thing is what they're. So within that framework, within the rules we are operating in, right? Whether it's in fighting or whether it's in this particular society and wrestling girl and read all about that too. Right? Exactly. So those are, that's a particular route you're, you are agreeing to play a particular game, right? Right. And you're just breaking the rules. That's all. I mean you have, you have soil body.

Speaker 3:          00:51:56       Well they're letting them break the rules. The rules are not and I think a lot of it is people worried about being called transphobic or homophobic or in any way prejudice where they're allowing certain people to compete in these. Like this woman in Australia, the Trans Woman in Australia that just broke all these world records in weightlifting because she was a fucking man or a whole life and all of a sudden became a woman. It's just killing everybody. And then there's the lifting, the runners and I think they're from Kenya or South Africa. No, the one from South Africa to color. I forget her name, but what do you mean? The one that's like a Hermaphrodite who will. I don't know what she is, but she's broken every record by like, you know, huge insane amounts and thinks she's just a woman with an abnormally large amount of testosterone.

Speaker 3:          00:52:38       I think they've actually done chromosomal tests. I don't know, when I saw her in the Olympics, I just jumped out at me. I just pulled that up because I'm pretty sure that that woman actually has been tested and then there was a real issue behind it and she felt terrible about it because it was just the way she was born. Really? Yeah. Yeah. Well, again, a spectrum. Yeah, I cooked. There's men. What a tremendous amounts of testosterone. There's men that have like almost none. That's actually the major point we need to talk about. You're totally on the right track there. I totally agree with that. That's the most important thing, which is that there's a spectrum, right? And so to say that there are that 50 percent of the world is male and 50 percent is female nonsense or men and men are right. That's say, I say to my students, I say, okay, there's 7 billion people in the world. Okay. Imagine in your mind lining all of them up, you know, naked in front of you. How many sections do

Speaker 2:          00:53:26       you see? Right? This is what I want you to do is get a picture of Yoel Romero and put it next to a picture of Andy Dick. Tell me they're the same thing. Telling me this is even. They're both men. Tell me it's even. It's nonsense. I mean, right. It's chaos. I've, you know, it's like, have you ever heard a guy on the streets? They, man, that's a lot of woman. Yes. Well that suggests there are women who are less women to them. Exactly. Yeah, that's exactly right. There's a spectrum and spectrum and sizes mean. That's what I was to ask you this. Okay. So let's push a little further. Okay, so, so far you're doing very well in your eyes. Some people are screaming at their fucking computer. Believe me. I know. Believe me. I know. I'm going almost. So that's. Well, no, I think you already are.

Speaker 2:          00:54:11       I think you already went all the way actually. I mean, so what? There's two things. There's, there's the Jordan Peterson view. Hang on, let me, let me put it out there and let me. Okay. What I think is he saying, which is that gender is fixed and biologically determined. I'm pretty sure he does believe that. Okay. That's what I would call sort of the traditional conservative. Conventional. Those both men. Yeah, exactly. Or you know what or like there's more than two categories in the world. Right. And so Andy Dick would be one. And where would you put me there mean neither one of those guys are in the middle there. I'm neither. One of them you will see the deal is both of them can procreate with women. They'll both met but, but whole lot of tech people who are called men cannot procreate with women a whole lot.

Speaker 2:          00:55:08       What do you mean? They've been trans women. Trans men live. They can't. It doesn't work. Oh, so they don't develop sperm or Sophia? Of course. I really common. Yeah. Once you tested when you were trying to get pregnant? No, I just knocked her up. Dude. Come on. Maybe I wasn't. But anyway, it certainly wasn't in there. And watch the fireworks. Yeah, see, there you go. So you're more of a man you've just proven yet again. He goes, the woman, yeah, Jesus Christ. When you. Yeah. That's not a great picture. It doesn't give you a sense of how it look at the thighs and the bolts bulge. Well, three times as high as most women. Whoa, okay. So reports leaked out. That doesn't really mean anything. I don't think she's ever really been tested. I believe she has. See if she's been tested. What does the test set, but it leaked. She was subjected to sex verification test after she won the world championships in Germany. And what does it say? Yellow results. We're supposed to be confidential, but reports leaked out that she had testosterone levels three times as high as most women. Other intimate details, better anatomy were also reported. A Somalia became targeted Semenya Semenya how brutal your first name is. The purse party named his semen. Seaman

Speaker 3:          00:56:25       became targeted with abuse on social media, but what does it say? This is. So is it saying that she's a hermaphrodite because they were talking to

Speaker 1:          00:56:31       about her. This is the clitoral size me. It's the equivalent of pretty much every article written about trump by the New York Times. Well, you know, a, a, a report was leaked by, you know, senior officials said, where's the actual evidence of any of this stuff? I don't see it. Yeah. What does it, it doesn't say anything. So she passed the test. Doesn't matter. He must have passed the test. Doesn't matter. Here's the thing. I think if I recall, if I were a woman athlete, right? Yeah. Um, I would want rules established. Um, it's like I would want rules established defining the physical characteristics of any of my potential opponents. Right? So it could be whatever bone density, muscle mass, you know, testosterone levels, you name it, you, you, you could probably speak to this better than I could, but I'm sure there's all sorts of ways you could actually define that pretty precisely.

Speaker 1:          00:57:27       And you can test those things and you can say, okay, you get to be in this. It's like weight classes and fighting. It's no different really. Right. I mean, you're not allowed to fight someone who's 30 pounds lighter than you are. And so you could do that in any sport, you could say, right. If you're above a certain height or above a certain weight or have this much muscle, are that much testosterone, you're not allowed in this category. There's nothing wrong with that. There's nothing sexist about that. There's nothing anti-trans about that. It's just a different candidate, but that's all that matters, right? That if that is the problem was that Fallon Fox had, as you said, more muscle, more testosterone, all these physical characteristics that were fundamentally different than all of the other women fighting in that category. In that particular game. That's all you gotta do.

Speaker 3:          00:58:11       Problem is that you can do damage to the person and it's not as simple as playing basketball against someone who had more testosterone. It's terrible to do that. There's also like there's a type of thinking that's involved in discussing this were the you. You have to follow a line of thinking. If you don't follow line, thank you're transphobic. You're a hateful person, you're a bigot, and that line of thinking is not science based. It's just not. When you. When you talk to board certified endocrinologist, do they talk about Trans People? One of the things that they talk about is the fact that when you take estrogen, it actually maintains bone densities, the reason why they give estrogen to women who have osteoporosis, so this idea that your bone density decreases when you go from being a man to a woman. It's bullshit. You're taking testosterone. Your bone density is going to stay the same or get thicker, but if you're taking estrogen, your bone density is also going to maintain. It's going to help you maintain so when you remove the body's ability to produce testosterone its own. There was a whole article and I'm bloody elbow of MMA by this board, certified endocrinologist, Dr Ramona sick and which she did different than everything else.

Speaker 2:          00:59:22       All these other articles is. She's not a gender reassignment surgeon, okay? All these other people that are commenting on this have a vested interest in it being completely neutral. There's all these people that are trans people that are commenting on it and they're doing it from a very biased perspective because we're not talking about mountain biking, which there was a woman who used to be a man who dominated mountain biking and it became a giant issue with people. They first supported her and then she was winning by such enormous margins. They were like, well, what the fuck? Same as the woman in Australia. That's the weightlifter. This is different. This is fighting. And I think fighting Fox almost killed that woman. She beat the shit out of a few girls, but then she lost Ashley, Evan Smith who is a biological female, you know, so it's.

Speaker 2:          01:00:07       You can beat someone like that. But again, Ronda Rousey probably beat the fuck out of most 135 pound men in the world that she meets. Of course, you know, it's just a matter of skill level. It's no different than ped, like banning pdds. We want to do that same thing. It's altering the body's chemistry, its abilities. Right? And so you don't want to compete against someone, show us that difference or unless you know, right as you're saying, and then you can or unless you're allowed to do the same thing, then it's all fair, but you couldn't. You would. The woman would have to take testosterone and balance it out and then you'd have to find out how would you balance out 30 years of my body naturally producing testosterone, increasing your ligaments strength and conditioning attendant strength. You also have, there's mechanical advantages of male hips are very different when it comes to kicking.

Speaker 2:          01:00:53       When it comes to certain types of movement. Women's hips go out and then their legs kind of come in at an angle and it's not not the best for kicking. It's not the best for a lot of different activities. Different. So I would just say that a trans woman is absolutely, in my view, a woman, fine. You know, I've done. That's their identity and I respect that however they want to identify because the category of woman, as you said, is so fluid, you know, let. I'm not going to say there's any absolute about that either that it can change and it's, you know, comes from her ideas, but still I respect that and I'll call you a woman. I'll treat you like a woman, but that means we have to change the sports, right? And we have to have just different categories. Instead of women's sports and man's sports, we need to have an woman and man categories in those sports.

Speaker 2:          01:01:41       We need to have different categories that are about people's physical composition, what you're made up of. Right? So it just like weight classes and pe days. There's no difference to me. Well, or there could be the argument that a person, a trans woman is a woman, but when you're talking about athletic competition, you're talking about a very biological thing. I'm saying if you take. You might have to say that someone has to be a biological female to compete. Again, I'm saying take the gender out of the sport, right? If you take that, if you stopped calling these gender names, then it's, then it's definitely not a trans issue. It's just about what your body's made up of. So for instance, adjust weight class Germane to random, he is pro, I don't know Rhonda Rousey more likely. It's probably made just physically

Speaker 1:          01:02:21       more like closer to a man, closer to Yoel Romero than Andy Dick. How dare you. She's going to find this and she's going to find you. Gosh, I hope so. If someone likes to be hit, it really choked out real fast. Um, yeah. So, so that means I would just say, you know, there should be a category you know, of in the sport, you know, for people who are made up of that composition and that could be people that the society identifies as men and who are or who identify as women or whatever. Oh Man. That's a, that's a slippery slope. Why? There's a lot of work there because like what, I mean, how would you define it and what parameters would use bone density? Well, you know, are a lot of African American women have similar bone density to white males. So does that mean you should be able to fight black checks?

Speaker 1:          01:03:06       Uh, maybe. It depends, right? So, well, no, actually the kind of aren't doing it up the old man, I'm not messing with that and we'll even though she's like, what, 60 years old, she gets down to 50. You could crush me. Um, no, but I mean they are doing it. In fact, we just saw this with, what's her name? A caster Semenya. But what are they doing with all this? It's the thing about testosterone level. What do they do? Actually they mentioned her. No, there's, there's a number for testosterone that you have to be below, right, to, to compete in that sport as a woman. So that's, that's what I'm talking about. Just add more categories, not just testosterone. You have to have. That's what this says. Okay. It says your testosterone goes above a certain level. You're not allowed to compete as a woman.

Speaker 1:          01:03:47       So I'm saying have that category and add more categories like that. And don't call it women. And men just say it's category x. You get to compete in this category if your testosterone, androgens what they're saying, but it's so ridiculously loose. It's saying a female with Hypo Androgen Ism who is recognized as a female in law shall be eligible to compete and women's competition in athletics provided that she has androgen levels below the male range, like all you have to do is just be like a couple notches below the male range, which is way above, but I'm saying that's all objectively determined you can do that. They're trying to get her to take suppression medication or. That's what I'm saying. This is all proving my point. These are objectively determine with them making her tone it down. We have numbers. We say if you hit this number for this category, you don't get to compete here, but this is so, so rare.

Speaker 1:          01:04:42       I mean she has a disease essentially where she produces too much to stop. This would apply to trans people is what I'm saying. Right. So if you. But what it. Because even so you're still dealing with the mechanical advantages of the male frame. The wider shoulder, especially when it comes to hitting. We could do that too and we do it with weight already. Why not a height? Sure. Boy, in fact, a lot of work I thought about that will look. I'm sure you have to like in weight classes, right? Like I have a huge advantage. I always use it. I'm six, one, one 65 and I've really long arms, so like most the time

Speaker 2:          01:05:18       people can't get inside my job. Like I just put it out there. They can and it's just a thing, but it's like I often feel like this isn't really fair in a way, you know, I don't have to be as good as they are. I can be looser and it's true for a lot of fighters, but once they get inside on you, they have an advantage. Like Mike Tyson used that advantage of being 5:10 on a lot of fighters an advantage. I think he just was really good at overcoming it. Hm. I think there's an in fighting and having shorter arms and he did the lower he did the peekaboo past the jab maximize really well. Really? He did that thing where it's did rocky Marciano and Danny, he had a really good way of getting inside of slipping the jab and moving constantly until he was inside on you and then he will crush you with this huge left hook, but once he's there, he doesn't have an advantage on you.

Speaker 2:          01:06:03       He's just there and he's Mike Tyson, but you don't think it's harder for a guy with a long ass spider arms to punch a guy who is in tight on you with short arms and is throwing shots to the body like Tyson. So I don't think so. I don't think so. I think there's advantages as long as you are physically competent. There's advantages in particular movements and positions to all sorts of different body styles. It's very true in Jujitsu guys with long arms and long legs and digits. You have massive advantages with chokes. You guys can get Darcis and guillotines and triangles easier, but you can also get arm barred easier because the mechanical advantages and armbarring you. There's, there's, there's some weird advantages to being like a twosome are Paul Horez, stocky short guy. Here's basket. How about basketball? There you go. Oh, it's all advantages tall.

Speaker 2:          01:06:47       Right. And in fact there are leagues, not an. Actually there might be professional leagues which are, you know, six feet and under leagues. Brilliant. Yeah. Many leads. Many P, this is very common because most people are under six feet tall. Right. So who could never play in the NBA even though they're amazing basketball players, but they just don't have the arm length and they don't have the height and all that. That's interesting. So we just need more divisions. The UFC, you should have like, you know, welter weight, it should be, there should be heights within it to was only five nines. There's a current. Isaiah Thomas, he's a good player for the number ones. Fantastic. He's the guys that are under six foot though. He's a great, great player. Around six foot. They get listed higher to the cheat. So interesting. He's. So. He's sort of the exception that proves the rule.

Speaker 2:          01:07:28       He's five nine, but he's really successful. Yeah. He's five, three, five, six or something like three, five, three, five, three and dunked. Spicy. Did five. No, I'm pretty sure. Mugs, you'd pull it up. Jamie. Jamie is my wheelhouse and you're in Jamie's wheelhouse in a big way, right? There's your mugs, but I'm pretty sure he ducked muggsy. Bogues. He may not have been a super clean dunk, but it was a dunk. Let's see. 10 out. Let's see if he dunked. Let go with a video. That's my life goal was to say pull it up Jamie. Okay. This spot web was mugsy. Does it have a video of him dunking?

Speaker 2:          01:08:07       I don't think so. We've never seen it in my google. Muggsy. Bogues. Yeah. What does she do? Muggsy. Bogues dunk and he did it. Google that crazy. Muggsy. Bogues dunk Jamie. Number two on Google. Let's say I got to watch this. I've never, ever seen this in my entire life. Dude. He just in a video game, that's probably not real. Yeah, I know, but he really did. I promise you in Mba life is in my memory, is that it wasn't a clean, super clean dunk, but he did get the ball above the rim with his hand on it. We're going to get to the bottom of this. Ladies and gentlemen, join, you'll get to that place is pretty essential if we don't solve this is a failure of a podcast. There's a big difference I think between team sports where you know, you could have an advantage of having a spud webb or muggsy bogues very mobile agile kind of guy who can set plays up versus guy like Shaq, big giant guy who can get in the way of things and I think there's all sorts of advantages and disadvantages of that size when you're talking about individuals against individuals.

Speaker 2:          01:09:08       That's where things get weird. And then when you're talking about combat sports, that's where people have just. There's some people that just have these tremendous advantages. Like, you know, Paul Daley is ridiculous power, like almost unfair. Like he hits guys and just obliterate. Yeah. But you know, that's not just strength. Yes. Yeah. And it's also, it's also geometry. Body geometry. Yes. Right. Yes. Lot of skinny dudes like me have power some. Yeah, a lot. Yeah. Right. And a lot of big Tommy hearns was the best example is a bunch of them, but he's also like this wide and then his waist is like this and this angle just I've thought it's actually. I've actually thought his shoulder with. Yeah, I think what I'm saying. Yeah. You get that slide. So this, the shoulders like that torque. Yeah, exactly. I mean it's more to swing. Yeah. That way.

Speaker 2:          01:09:58       Yeah, for sure. Wide shoulders, uh, rotate around the spine. Yeah. Oftentimes equate, especially when they learn striking sports at an early age. They learn how to develop that snap and fluidity. Tenants to a lot of muscle bound. Guys don't, don't know. So they do, they have it. I want you to go talk to Dana and get this, get this going. And we, we need a height, uh, divisions we need. Um, we need testosterone, you know, division to comp, testosterone level, division. Going to have estrogen level divisions. I think we're where are literally one generation away from being able to use crispr and all these new genetic engineering tools to make people whatever style of person you want. I think you're going to be able to develop six foot, four super athletes that look like Anthony Josh or Vitali Klitschko or Vladimir Klitschko. You're going to be able to make those now what I would give for bionic knees, right.

Speaker 2:          01:10:52       These are fucked up, but never when they're not, they're okay. They're. They're problematic, but I can. I can function fine, but they could go out and anytime. You know what I mean? If you've never been worried about that, he never had to worry. Right. Can you imagine? Well, if you could just reduce, but I'm telling you what they were talking about before the podcast, what they're doing now with stem cells, with soft tissue injuries. It's tremendous. I mean, it's really amazing. It's never happened before. What they're able to do to people that have meniscus injuries is literally shoot stem cells in there and you've regenerate meniscus tissue. I mean, that's just never happened before and I think that this is baby steps. I think what we're at right now is really, really young. I don't think 20, 30 years from now because 20 years ago they didn't really use it at all.

Speaker 2:          01:11:35       Twenty years from now, I think it's going to be insane. Got to be able to. I mean, they're regenerated a woman's bladder using her skin tissue. They built her a bladder. She had bladder cancer. They built her a bladder and then reinstalled it in her body. Now she has a functional bladder that came out of her own body. They're regenerated. I think they're gonna be able to do that with tendons and ligaments and all sorts of tissue. I believe it, and hopefully this is really promising. They're going to be able to do that with brain tissue, so people that have had brain injuries, people that have had cte, they're hopefully going to be able to use some of these therapies to regenerate brain tissue. Wow. Yes. That's huge. Neurogenesis is, that's, that's the promise land. God bless him. You know, I don't know anything about science. I'm just a complete idiot when it comes to math and science.

Speaker 2:          01:12:20       But man, just go for it. And by the way, as far as universities, you know, I'm, I am the harshest critics of universities generally, but well, mostly what I'm talking about it actually the humanities and social sciences when I do that, what goes on in the biology building, the chemistry building, the physics building, I don't know, but I know that what comes out of them is a better life for me and all of us, they're making this stuff that you're talking about and so go for it. And so, you know, renegade universities, not, we're not gonna do no science. We're going to let, we're going to let Harvard and mit keep going. Have that guys, you know, because you're doing great stuff. I have no critique of that as far as I know. There's nothing going on there that's wrong, but it's just the humanities and social sciences that are utterly corrupt.

Speaker 2:          01:12:59       Well, we got way off the track here with what we were talking about initially was Jordan Peterson. I disagree with him when it comes to gender and what you agree with him when it comes to the suppression of expression of professors and all the people worried about being called racist and sexist and anything else stifling free speech. So what he's facing is even worse than, than what goes on in the United States in a sense. And that it's, it's now legal persecution. He is actually, you know, it's against the law to not use these gender pronouns in your class. Um, which is that suppression of speech, that suppression of Academic Freedom. It's a complete violation of those things. In fact. And that's totalitarian. I mean there's nothing, no two ways around it. My uncle at Canada has these, these laws, right? And they have a human rights commission, I think it's called or human, something conditioned human rights council council. And they do this body of people who sit there and decide who should have a website or not. And my uncle is actually happened to him about 10 years ago. He was accused of being a Holocaust denier because, and I don't even know exactly what he was saying on there, but he's a Ukrainian and I think he was sorta just defending these Ukrainians who were accused of being Nazis during the World War II. I don't know. It doesn't

Speaker 1:          01:14:12       matter. Even if he were a holocaust denier, he should have his website. Right? The Canadian. You go to that url, it's shut down. In effect, they put a banner now it says this is now controlled by the Canadian government or something. Oh No. Yeah, no. They have no free speech in Canada. I mean there's no. There's no sort of doctrine. Legal or otherwise in Canada of free speech is bad and that's what Jordan Peterson's facing. It's because he's Canadian. This would not happen in the United States until, of course, you know, the sociologists take control and then they will have these laws, but we don't have them here, so he actually could go to prison. That's what's, that's what's happening. He could go to prison for not saying xer

Speaker 3:          01:14:50       in his class. There was an article that vice published that someone linked to me today about this that I did not read yet because I announced the Jordan is going to be returning to the podcasts and someone was saying that his interpretation of these laws is greatly exaggerated. See if you could find that. It's a very recent advice article. I'm pretty sure it's illegal and illegal means you can go to prison. Ultimately, I don't think Jordan's wrong and I don't think he would. Exactly.

Speaker 1:          01:15:14       No, no, no. I looked into this. It's elite because that matters a lot to me. I am a hundred percent and solidarity with him on that and he's completely right that the state, no one should be telling him to what to say in his classroom and certainly shouldn't be going to prison for it or being threatened in any way legally. He was just a fine a fine. Right. People don't understand this. It's incredible how people don't understand that everything the state does is enforced by the threat of ultimate violence. Right? So my mother even said this recently. She said, oh, it doesn't it. There is no violence with parking tickets. They just send you a fine. I said, Oh really? So if you get the fine and you don't pay it, what happens? Then we get another notice and another notice, right? Mom and then another notice and then finally what happens?

Speaker 1:          01:15:58       Korryn gaines is black woman in Maryland a couple of years ago. This is exactly what happened. You got a bunch of traffic tickets and she's refused to pay them and ultimately what happened, the Swat team came to her house and she pulled a gun and they shot her in the head. That was over traffic fines. Okay. That's what happens. That's what it means to make something illegal at the end of the day, for the. For it to be meaningful as a law, the state has to use lethal violence to enforce it or the potential for lethal while. In other words, if you don't pay your taxes, even if it's $100 in taxes, ultimately otherwise the law is meaningless, right? They have to eat. They have to put you in prison or kill you.

Speaker 3:          01:16:40       Well, that was what was most offensive about that. Sandra Bland case, when you got to hear the interaction between her and the cop, she did nothing wrong and this cop is dragging her out of the car and then ultimately she died and they don't know how she died and there's, she was pissed off. She talked back because he pulled her over. Fleet told her to put out her cigarette. Right. And she's like, because she was being disrespectful. Exactly. She wasn't. If you listen to the, the, the actual record. No, no. She just wasn't following him to the like

Speaker 1:          01:17:09       she wasn't treating him with respect that he felt he deserved hold on there. I think she was being disrespectful and that's why she's my hero. I mean, because think she was disrespectful. That's why she's a hero, but I don't think she was because you shouldn't be. You shouldn't respect that. I thought. I mean it's dangerous and that's why she's a martyr. I'm not. I wouldn't, I wouldn't recommend it to people. I wouldn't tell my son to do that, but he deserved no respect. The law enforcing that law in that way, treating her in that way, in that moment was deserved. No respect whatsoever and that's to me why she's the hero, not that she was a victim, she was a victim, but to me what was great about her was that she said, no, I'm not gonna put up my cigarette and why did you pull me over for this?

Speaker 1:          01:17:53       This is bullshit. Well, I mean, you have no reason to pull me over and do this to me right now. I'm on my way to someplace. I'm trying to get some. Is she getting pulled over for. I think it was a. I think it was as it was a lighter. So she like didn't turn. I think it was a turn signal. Okay. It was something really trivial. Well, I don't think he has the right to tell her to put out her cigarette. So that's not a disrespectful thing. He's overstepping his boundaries. I need to do in your car smoking a cigarette in her car. They have the right, they have the right and I think in some municipalities the obligation because you are supposed to. Here's the thing where Joe, I mean, this is the other thing is this is the thing that La rests upon.

Speaker 1:          01:18:31       It rests upon us respecting legal authorities. If we don't, there ain't no law. Yeah, but there's no legal authority for you to stop you from doing a lawful act like if she has a cigarette lit in our car. When she gets pulled over, the cops says, put your cigarette out. What he's doing is just controlling her. They don't think they give them latitude. They give the cops latitude in determining who is obeying their orders and not. So if this could be. I'm sure this yet, I'm not defending this. I'm saying this is the problem. I'm saying that in court, I would bet you anything he would say that show that she wasn't listening to me. She wasn't obeying my orders. I think he told her to put her hands on the car or something and she had a cigarette or enhance, so she had to take the cigarette out of her hand to do what he was asking.

Speaker 1:          01:19:14       In other words, I'm saying that's all worthy of disrespect. I'm not defending it at all. Right. The other thing though about this, and this is something I've been working on lately and uh, I've been doing some work with some people at free think media about this, but is I think, and I've changed my mind about this. This has been a new thing for me. I have thought about race my whole life basically really, really hard. And this is, I've changed my mind about this when, when things like that happen. Sandra Bland, Mike Brown, Eric Garner, even Walter Scott, the guy who was shot in the back in South Carolina. What have you got where they planted the Taser? Well, that's again, hold on there. So I like everyone in the country pretty much saw those things and thought a, that's horrific. A and B, that's racist. Okay. And that what people do overwhelmingly is they focus on what they believe is the racism of the cop, the individual, that that's what caused those cops to shoot those guns in those moments.

Speaker 1:          01:20:22       I think that's a mistake for one thing. We will never know why they chose to shoot, to pull the trigger in that moment. We will never know that it was racist. There's no way to prove that. There's no way to demonstrate it. Um, and there's nothing we can do about it. You can't. What can you do to change people's ideas about race or black people? You can't. Certainly not anytime soon what all those cops were doing and all those instances. And this is why they got off. They were following the law and they were following police procedure which actually obligated them to do, to do those things. So Walter Scott, and believe me, I was convinced that was a racist cop, that that was clearly a bad killing and it was a bad killing, but not for the reasons that people are talking about. I have no way to know whether that cop was racist and that's why he did that.

Speaker 1:          01:21:16       But if we do know and people have done work on this, that he is very reasonable to assume that he was doing in that moment what he was obligated to do by law, which is if you look at the video carefully, he very well could have thought that Scott was still holding his taser because Scott grabbed the Taser and then dropped it immediately. But if you look at where the cop is looking, he may not have seen that we're talking about different thing then because I'm talking about the cop that shot the guy and then drop the Taser near his body. We're talking about the same thing. Now, here's what I grabbed the Taser that here's what happened. Okay. Yeah. Walter Scott grabs his taser. He grabbed the cops, Taser crab footage, just ran, pulled, not pulled the Taser out of his holster and had it for a second and then, and then started to run.

Speaker 1:          01:22:02       And as he's turning to run, he drops it immediately and he's running away and it gets, you know, a good whatever, 10, 20 yards away and the cop shoots him in the back. Okay. So according to South Carolina police procedure and I, and according to the Supreme Court decisions, uh, the cop not only was had the right, but the obligation to use lethal force because he could have believed in that moment that Scott still held the Taser in his hand. If a person takes a police officer's weapon, police are obligated to use lethal force to stop them. So if you look, you just have to. There's a, there's a video, there's a documentary about this. It's called frame. I forget the number, I think it's three 94. You might be able to find it, Jamie. But um, and it's plausible. It's not definite, but this is what happened.

Speaker 1:          01:22:50       But it is plausible if you look the way the, where the cop was looking, he may not have seen that, that the Taser was on the ground. I'm super confused because I thought that the cough drop, hold on, I'm not venting. Listen, let me finish. So he's like, so Scott running away 20 yard shots in the back. Then the cop walks over to him during that time. He does see that the tasers on the ground next to him, next to the cop, he picks up the Taser. The cop does walks over and drops it on the ground next to Scott momentarily and then picks it back up. Uh, so who knows what was going on there. He, he may have been insured, he may have been trying to cover himself in that moment, but actually he didn't need to that cop. You know what happened with that trial?

Speaker 1:          01:23:28       It's a hung jury. He's, he's free because of this, because I'm sure we don't know for sure, but I know that this was the argument made by by the cops lawyer, was that it is totally reasonable to assume that he believed he was. He had reason to shoot him legally. So that's one part of that story, right? Which is that the law is the problem. Okay. Not The cops stopped focusing on that copy. You'll never find out. You'll never be able to prove that he did it because he's a racist. And even if we did, what's that going to give two? What's that going to get us? That's not going to save anybody the next time this happens. Right, but what will save people's. If we, if we change those laws, here's the worst law that really made the whole thing happened in the first place that no one's talking about.

Speaker 1:          01:24:13       The whole thing started when Scott was driving through North Charleston, right? The Cop, I think it was a suspended license plate or something, or a tail light tail light. I think it was taillight. Something trivial pulls them over. At that time, Scott was in arrears on child support payments. Right, and you go to. Here we go. You go to prison if you. If you get behind on your child support payments, and he had been, I think put in jail a few times in his life for this. You get put in prison and there's a whole bunch of men right now as we speak in prison for that very reason, and these child support payments by the way, are set by judges often in a system that read that massively favors the women, the mothers. That whole system. You've never been divorced, right? I have. You know, as soon as you enter it, you see right away that the whole thing is stacked against us and it's, this is, you know, it's just, you look into it, if you don't believe me, you have to basically nine friends and I went through the mildest divorce.

Speaker 1:          01:25:11       I mean my ex wife was as, as easy on me as you could be, but nonetheless I ended up paying a lot more child support than she really deserved and very. But not a lot. I mean, but it was a lot of men. Oh. In fact, you do have a friend just happened to I think, right? Yeah. Yeah. You go into these courtrooms and it's basically down to a judge as to a friend who has to pay alimony for the rest of his life. Yeah. He was married for 12 years. He's been divorced for 14. He still has to pay his ex wife. He's married to a new woman. He has a new family. He didn't even have kids with. This woman has to pay her forever. Yeah, forever. Imagine if. Imagine if they had kids. He fucked her so hard. She can't work anymore forever. How about that? That's a crazy little lot to say about that, but yeah. Uh, but uh, that's a crazy law when they have windows kids involved. Right? Forget about it. That's a very sexist law by the way, because that law is implying that this woman is incapable of making it on her. Thank you. By

Speaker 2:          01:26:04       definition, it's antifeminist. Yes. It's antifeminist and it's sexist and it's patriarchal. It's totally patriarchal. Women who support it, they're supporting it because they don't like men. I mean that literally what it is, what it is, who knows? I don't know about listening. If you're supporting a woman, never having to work again because she married a guy for a certain amount of time, like relationships come and go. People get tired of each other. People have the right to change. You shouldn't be financially obligated to take care of someone for the rest of their life just because you were married at one point in time. That's crazy. Completely agree with you. Especially in today's Day and age where my friend is 54, I think he is now. He could live to be 100, so what the fuck? He's got to pay for her for another 46 years.

Speaker 2:          01:26:43       That's insanity. Phenomenal. Yeah, but again, when you that I agree with you completely, but what you said just then about it being sexist, it is. That's a radical concept that hasn't even, I think registered with most people and if many people heard it, they would think you are a sexist yourself for saying it, but you know what? It is inescapable that that's what's going on. That sexism against men is very common. It's sexism against women too. That's what we're also sending them. That's the radical part of this, right? It's actually patriarchal in the most fundamental sense, which is that the court is saying that the man should be the provider. I'm going to tell you a story. There's a woman in Florida who is a bit in my act and I'm doing now. It's a true story. There's a woman in Florida was a cop.

Speaker 2:          01:27:26       She was 25 years old. She pretended to be a high school student and she's attractive woman, made friends with this boy. He thought it was his girlfriend and she talked him into selling her pot and then she arrested him. That only works when you have a 17 year old boy and a 25 year old woman. If you had a 25 year old man throwing dick, your 17 year old daughter, and then he gets her to sell him pot and then he arrests her. There would be people lining the fucking street with torches to kill that guy, but people are sexist against boys. They feel that boys should just keep it in his pants, that boys should know better and you know as well as I know when you're 17 years old, you are baffled bag of hormones with a boner just running through the world trying to figure out what the fuck's going on and you're 12 months away from being an adult.

Speaker 2:          01:28:14       It's chaos. It's craziness to end to think that this young boy should be able to think clearly in that moment while there's 25 year old woman has manipulating them is insane, but they allowed it and this kid has a felony on his fucking record right now. Yup. This is, this is the root of the issue with feminism. That is current feminism in its current incarnation. I am a feminist by the way. How dare you can define the lead. Now's her. Uh, but I will just be an egalitarian. Yeah. So. Well, that's okay. I'm not that either. I'm not a nigger Alterian, but um, you're not. No. Oh, hold on. Too many topics. I'm like, Jesus Christ, we go off a lot of branches here and I love it. Um, where was I going? Oh, this family. What you did was you identified, and I think actually we,

Speaker 1:          01:29:02       I talked about this the first time I was here, which is, that know this is what's, to me at the heart of this is the appalling irony at the heart of contemporary feminism as practiced by self-defined feminists. Okay. Many, not all guys. I'm not generally, I'm not saying all feminists are like this, but I'd say it's certainly, it's the dominant strain right now, which is that it is at its heart patriarchal, which it treats women as vulnerable, weak, powerless, or incapable of making their own way in this world. And it treats men as the not just forget about the men, forget about how they treat men. It's how they treat women. That's sexist. It says that they need protection from the state, which is run by usually men, but it's also this other institution or you know, college presidents need to protect these women from 19 year old boys. You want to have sex with them. Same thing. They're constantly calling for women to be protected by these institutions. The state by men, it is patriarchal and sexist right at the, at the heart of it. And same thing with family court and divorce law and all that stuff. That's how they get treated. They get treated like they're the ones who need to be taken care of by a man. It is. It's like 19 fifties. Sexism. It's like madmen sexism. That's what. That's what most feminists are calling for now.

Speaker 3:          01:30:27       Well, I disagree when you're talking about child rearing because I think that

Speaker 1:          01:30:32       child support is,

Speaker 3:          01:30:33       should be absolutely mandatory and it's very important. And if a woman is the only one raising the kids on her own, not only does she need the money for food and housing, but also probably for someone to babysit her kids. There's a lot of factors involved and totally agree. And if the man's not in the scene like yeah, he owes money for sure. He has a responsibility. And as a father, at the very least that's what you should be doing is contributing financially. I totally agree. I totally agree. I'm not opposed to paying child support. Alimony. Alimony is weird. Yeah, that makes no sense at all. It's weird. Well, it's. I don't think it's a bad thing if someone like say, how about this? Say let's turn around. Say you had a wife who was wealthy and she was taking care of you while you're going through school and she promised that she was going to fund you all the way through your phd program.

Speaker 3:          01:31:27       She was going to give you money so you didn't have to worry about anything but your education. And then once you got out then you guys could share income. But somewhere along the way, she decided she was done with you and then you're fucked. But during the middle of this program that you have to pay for, I don't think it's unreasonable to say that she should give you until you could figure your own system out so you don't have to quit your phd program and go get a job somewhere and get an apartment and a car. I don't think that's. That's it. I don't think that's unreasonable. What's unreasonable is saying that because you guys were together for a amount of time, she has

Speaker 1:          01:32:00       to pay you for the rest of your life. Sure. That's insanity. Sure. And that's current. I agree. That's real. I agree that's a sexist. But should that be legal though? So that'd be legally enforced. Should courts be deciding how long the alimony is paid and that's. I don't know. How has that happened? Like what? What's the motivation behind that for the courts to succumb to give in and just explain it to you? It's sexism, it's patriarchy and the feminists are playing along with it. That's it. It's this. Yeah. It's this idea that women can't make words though, isn't the courts, aren't there a lot of men involved in those courts do. I mean, why are they allowing all this stuff and most of them think basically like feminists or at least they. They are expected to behave and make decisions like feminist feminism has become dominant in that way in our culture going on for decades.

Speaker 1:          01:32:46       Laws have existed long before feminism and so prevalent. That's my point. It went from sexism, patriarchy, those laws. Oh, I see what you're saying. So feminism is basically continuing that stuff in. It's Nagy back on it. And switching up the definition, let me say really loud and clear. There have always been feminists who hate this stuff as much as you and I do. Camille Paglia. Okay. And they have been loud and clear about this for a long, long time. And I love them and they're my heroes and I've learned from them. This is, I've learned these things from them. Okay. But the ones who really are powerful and dominant in the media, the ones we hear from the public intellectuals, the academics, government leaders, the people who end up in the White House, you know, Obama's staff in hhs, health and Human Services and the Department of Education became very clear to me that all these sexual assault laws and rules that came out of there, they were, they were coming right out of colleges and they were really have that.

Speaker 1:          01:33:44       They were of the sort of college feminist movement. They were the ones who sent that letter in 2011 that made it basically mandatory for colleges to set up these kangaroo courts for sexual abuse, sexual assault cases. All the nonsense. You and I talked about a couple years ago. Yeah. Um, yeah, I go. Anybody interested in review those or earlier podcast about your college? About oxide? Yeah. As many colleges. But you know, there's a whole backlash now, right? There's a huge. It's all turning back and I knew it was going to happen. Now they are completely being decimated. There's hundreds, maybe even thousands of men who are suing in court and many of them are winning right now for good reason because there was no due process because they weren't allowed to, you know, ask questions. That poor boy the mattress boy with that girl put a mattress on her back and drags around campus and then took her graduation speech with a mattress. They live. Went on stage with a mattress. I mean, the whole thing was so fucking crazy. Oh yeah. My uh, yeah. There's this fantastic sex worker activist named Christine Pereira, who's in Vegas. She said she tweeted something like, when that happened, he said, fuck you, mattress girl. For those of us who have really been raped, you're a fucking disgrace. She went off. It was something like that. Yeah. And it was. That girl seems pretty crazy. That mattress girl. Yeah. That was an extreme

Speaker 2:          01:34:58       example of them boys suing that school there also. And many of them are winning and I don't know what happened in those cases. I don't even know what happened to mattress girl for sure. For sure. I know that there's all kinds of evidence that sure looks like it didn't happen the way she said it. Didn't know for sure and I never will. We will never know. You can't know, but what we do know for absolute sure is that there's been terrible or no due process in those cases. Right. And so that's the problem. I mean that basically the accuser gets to win every time. Imagine if that was our legal system writ large. Right. Jo, you stole a million dollars from yesterday. All right. Put Him in jail. That's basically what's happening. Exactly. Okay. Yeah. Well, I mean it got so crazy that even rolling stone printed a false rape case that that gang rape case and Uva k astonishing, which is just how did a company that's been in the journalism business, as long as they've been, how did they fuck that up?

Speaker 2:          01:35:54       Yeah. That was. That was the turning point. I think when that came out that it was completely made up. I think since then it started to turn something that's good that things like that happen so that you realize why it's important to have checks and balances and that people. It reaffirms this idea of real journalism is important to have your facts in order to have checks and double check things and make sure you know what the fuck you're printing. I think it's good for society. I think it's terrible for John Doe all the John Doe's out there, all those men who were accused and expelled and had their names ruined and their careers ruined. College careers destroyed and all that stuff, right? I think, but yes, you're also, even if you're exonerated, the emotional turmoil that you go through, there's no way they can reward you for that.

Speaker 2:          01:36:37       There are compensate you for that rather. So that. But that is part of that whole thing, as I said before, is part of this sort of ironic feminist patriarchy ideology. Right? Which is, you know, we need protection. We can't, we can't because we can't say no to men. We can't stop them by saying, no, we need, you know, w w we need help. Just there, we need to, we need the college president to save us or the cops or someone. It's, it's an incredible, um, well then there's this also this thing where two people are drinking and if two people are drinking, the girl is getting raped, but there you go. Same thing guys not getting ready because women are incapable of controlling themselves when they're drunk. Sexist as hell. Exactly. Because the man's drunk too, but it doesn't. Somehow or another, it doesn't matter. Even if they're both like sending texts back and forth. Do you have condoms? Like the Occidental case, patriarchal women, our children, their daughters going to be taken care of by dad. And the sons are men. Yeah. Even though they're just same age. And they're boys. Yeah. Yeah. They have full agency. Yeah. And the women. The women are daughters. Yeah, it is sexist. It's incredible. Yeah. So, um, so okay. Gender, Jordan Peterson. I'm, so, I'm completely absolutely with him. You know, when it comes to that, when it comes to policing of language and.

Speaker 1:          01:37:56       But he, as I said, I, I, I could be wrong about this, but it sounded to me and I've listened to him on your show and I've listed them elsewhere and a lot of people have pointed him to me and vice versa because they think we agree on these things and we don't, which is that he thinks seems to me that gender is biologically determined that there are two genders, they're fixed in nature and that's the end of that discussion off he's ever said that. And I don't, I really don't think he has. Yeah. Well thank you. Said that when it comes to gender identity, that he doesn't believe that we need more pronouns and so he thinks it's just wrong. If you think you're a woman when you were born with a penis, it's just by. It's just sort of absolutely wrong. I think you would have to find him saying that before. I'm really glad to hear you say that because I wasn't sure where you stood on that. No, I mean fuck man, that's a big deal. I think that's a big deal. It can get super weird when. Okay. How about Rachel Dolezal she identifies as being black? Yeah. Let's use transracial. How do you feel about that? I think she's correct.

Speaker 1:          01:38:59       Not, no, hang on, let me, let me, uh, let me tell you what correct means. They're not in a, not in an absolute way, right? Not a scientific objective way, but it's just as true as anything else. Meaning that because so race and here's where a, here's, here comes Sam Harris now and I'm sure Jordan Peterson's in this boat to buy. No, Sam Harris's, because I just heard him talking about this with Charles Murray. He believes there's, there are races of people. He thinks that race is a real thing. He's, he's definitely subtle about it. Nuanced. He says, you know, it's the divisions between races in the lines are blurry and it, you know, but he believes there's a biological basis to race. He's very clear about that and that is to me, absurd and completely unscientific and it's easily disprovable by according to his own standards and by scientific standards.

Speaker 1:          01:39:53       But you see a black guy from Kenya, you see a white guy, a Chinese guy from China. What's the difference? No difference. So here's, here's the answer you tell me. Right? Which is that. So historically, the differences between them have changed that we people, human beings have said different things have created different categories and filled those categories with different characteristics over the centuries. Those have changed constantly. Right? And my first time I was on here, we had a long discussion about what's in my book renegade history on immigrants, the Irish and the Italians and the Jews. When they got here to the United States here and in Europe, they were largely considered to be negroes. Right? Right. And now there is. Why does anybody. Right. So what are they at that time in the early 20th century, it was not like when I say common belief, I mean it was taught in schools. The following taught at

Speaker 2:          01:40:54       the following that Europeans were made up of three distinct races. There were the nordics and northern Europe, the Alpines in central Europe and the Mediterranean and in southern Europe. And they were very different biologically. The nordics where rational, intelligent, disciplined. They were the ones who made civilization. They should run the country. The alpines we're okay there could be decent farmers, but they're never going to do Algebra and they certainly can't run a government. The mediterraneans were basically either like negroes are really close and therefore should be slaves or just peasants. That's why people, you know it. You're telling me you're talking about a long time ago. No, we're talking about a hundred years ago, which historically holding your breath, but you know, you love ancient history. I mean if you look at the whole sweep of human history, that's five minutes ago, right? It is.

Speaker 2:          01:41:49       But it's still a long time in terms of how we address it today, but it will really address it today. If you're looking at it. Someone from China. Oh, you're looking at a dark black man from Kenya. Yeah. There's something different about them. Do you think it's just melanin? Sure. That's the horse. There's something different about them, the many different things. Where do you draw the line about around races though, right? So look at all the people in Kenya. Okay. Which ones are Kenyans and which ones are they all Kenyans and what makes them Kenyan or are they all Africans? Well, you know, you can do the all black right passed on someone and find out where their origins are. You can find out how much Irish you have in you so much. South African, you can me. You can do all that. You can go all the way back to your family lineage through jeans.

Speaker 2:          01:42:33       I get that total. If you want to go all the way back. We're all African. Sure. Well there you go. That's another way to disprove this whole thing. Right? Right. But it's disproving it because we in these proving it, sorry, that's a bad word to use. Here it is calling it out as a fiction, as a social construct, which is that these lines have been drawn all the time in all kinds of different ways over the centuries by human beings who just look at all the people in the world. They line up the 7 billion people, right in their mind and they draw lines is say, oh, these people over here, this side, those are the negroes. And over here, these are the mongoloid. And over here these asiatics and over here, these are the nordics. And over here the areas and the Jews and those change all the time.

Speaker 2:          01:43:15       But these are just categories we invent, right? So who's black? Jimi Hendrix, black. Well, Jimi Hendrix has a mixed background, right? I mean it wasn't his mother white. What's his race? Is he black or white? It's a good question. There you go. Got It. A lot in them. But. So, but there's a big difference between someone like Jimmy Hendrix and someone that is like very, very dark, comes from a specific part of the world where everyone around them is very, very dark. Let's do that, are very obvious and repeatable characteristics. Let's do that. So Congo, these come from Chicago, okay? The people there, they're pygmies actually immigrants. And even the staff room, you know what we can do? West Africans were slaves were the west where the western slaves, American slaves come from. Um, and just across the continent, not even that far away. You know, there's Somalia, Somalians look like, right?

Speaker 2:          01:44:11       Yeah. And Ethiopians, right. You think about them and how they look and think about how the, uh, west West Africans look. Are they the same race will very, very, very characteristic, very dark Somali. Somalis looked different than everybody clearly. Right. You know, as Somali immediately, right? Same continent, same pigmentation basically. Yeah. Other facial structured, very different. Why are they black? Why are they the same race? Is the question at the same race or. I mean what I'm saying about Somalians, like would you, would you, would you consider Somalians the same as like Ethiopians or as the same as Egyptian. My thing is also Africa. My thing is let's get rid of these categories. There is, these are all silly made up categories. There's no reason to. They're all arbitrary. Okay. Lines have been drawn between groups of people arbitrarily over the centuries, but what you see, you're arguing against something that Sam Harris said.

Speaker 2:          01:45:10       So what did Sam Harris say specifically? Not just him. It's a lot of people, but yeah. So you don't agree that there is any race at all? I'm just saying it's a fiction. It's made, right? It's just a. it's like is it a fiction or is it a way? We're trying to define the variations between human groups because there are variations. So that's definitely what it's been about. That's definitely been the motivation. Right. And think about what the consequences have been. Okay. But it's never been good just because there's never glances for variations or recognizing variations doesn't mean you should stop recognizing actual variations, but then you make. But they always make claims right after that. Like it doesn't have to what Sam Harris is Straw man, isn't it? I mean did you don't have to make a claim that Chinese people are different because they look different, but then it's just, well this is what a Chinese person generally they have these very stringent characteristics.

Speaker 2:          01:46:00       They don't have blonde hair, they don't have blue eyes. I'm not tall and skinny. They look like Chinese. Sure. But then again, Chinese people all look the same. I mean there's to say that, right? But again, with a clear characteristics, the difference between a Chinese person and a black person is very clear. Uh, uh, not really well and not always Kenyan. So lives in Kenya who was born and raised multiple generations deep and their parents are canyon, their grandparents at Kenyon. There's a very big difference between them and someone who lives in Shanghai. Yeah. But who was born in Shanghai? They're parents were born in Shanghai. They'd go all the way back. Many, many generations of being pure Chinese. Right? But there are infinite variations even among people who have lived only in Shanghai, but what do you want to call the variations? Nothing but, but, but you're talking about something that's clearly

Speaker 1:          01:46:50       or you just ignore it. I would say that there's, of course, there are genes that run in families and I completely agree that, you know, genes determine in large part how we look. Fine. So you can certainly say this person is likely because of their genes connected to that person, last generation to that generation, to this, you know, and his family lineage. Sure. Well, what does that give you? I don't know. Nothing. I mean it's. The thing is that people have taken that and they've said, oh, well these particular characteristics are human beings. We are talking about complexity and human beings at the beginning of this. Right? People are infinitely complex. Right? Okay. So the thing is, what people have done historically is they've just picked certain characteristics among people and said, oh, that is what determines your race is the issue. The word race is maybe the issue.

Speaker 1:          01:47:39       Like there are obvious physical characteristics. The difference between someone who is a mon goal versus someone who, uh, is a Brazilian versus someone who is. There's some pretty obvious physical characteristics for geographic areas. What would you agree like, or common physical characteristics for some geographic areas? Or You could say on average people in China are shorter than people in Polynesia. Well, here's the place where you could do it. Canada, like, try to find a Canadian. Like you don't know what a Canadian looks like. They could be English, they could be American, they could was trying to entertain. You're your strongest argument. Okay. So like China, right? You can certainly say that people in China are on average, on average, shorter than people in Polynesia. Right? Will they look different? Whatever. That's one way in which they look different. Right. Facial talking about physiognomy facial feature.

Speaker 1:          01:48:31       That bone structure. Polynesians find to be like really stout. I suppose you could say, you know, the, the width of their eyes is narrower or whatever on average and whatever. Sure. Okay. Okay. So what is it? I mean, what did we. Okay. So they, they are likely to be in lineage from that part of the world. Fine. That's cool. I've got no problem with that. But what else do you want to say? The thing is, Joe, no one stops there. They always go on to that. They always go on from there and they start to make all these other claims. Oh well that race is really good at math. Their Iq is higher. This is what actually Sam Harrison, Charles Murray were just saying, they can do the, they can do the, um, they can do the coding for Google better than, than other people can, whatever, right?

Speaker 1:          01:49:20       They are more, they are more scrupulous. They smoked cigarettes more, whatever it is, you know, they used to be accused of being a more easily addicted to opium, you name it, right. Things changed, but that's the problem is that once you start there, people have used those differences for other reasons almost always, which are nefarious and injurious and you have done terrible things to people. Your problem is recognizing those characteristics and those differences and calling it a race and then attaching all sorts of other claims to this category. Precisely. Yeah. That's exactly what Sam and Charles Murray, this is Charles Murray's thing, although it's actually, it's only a small part of his work and he gets accused of it being central and it's not. But anyway, he does still nonetheless believed this and so to Sam Harris and so did other people that there are differences in Iq among races.

Speaker 1:          01:50:17       Okay. Now on the surface level, they are completely correct. There's no question, meaning that Iq scores among people that we identify as African American have been lower than among the people we define as white American. Totally true, totally true, and they are right that that is suppressed, that we are not allowed to even talk about that data, which is there and it's. I have no problem with that. I'm sure that's true. Here's the thing though. How do we define African American and how do we define white first? That's the first problem. Those, as you know, definitions have changed over time, so Jews used to be in the African American group and Italians used to be in the African American group was. No, no, never, never called African Americans. They were, they were called negroes. Yes, they were. Shoes were called negroes. A book written is in my book renegade history in ninth in 1911, there was a book written by a scholar and this was one of many, the title of which his name was Arthur abernethy.

Speaker 1:          01:51:22       The title of which was the Jew is a negro. That's the title of it was common. This is what pieces, what year this is. This is all through the late 19th and early 20th centuries from about the 18 eighties when the Jews started coming over and big numbers from the 18 eighties until the 19 forties. This was, I'm not, I'm saying this is what was taught in college classrooms that Jews were of a different race and there was some difference of opinion about whether they were black or whether they were just some other kind of inferior race, but they certainly weren't white. That was, that was widely agreed upon until world war two basically. All right, so how do we define African-american? Is Jimi Hendrix, African-american? Does he, you're talking to. There's a big difference, isn't there in the term African American versus Negro, right. Because like it's the same thing.

Speaker 1:          01:52:12       It's just a different name for the same category. Yeah. But it's from Africa. They knew that these Jews weren't from Africa. So the. So the one drop system continent, I don't know. They believe that they believe that the genes and the right about this. Right. That the genes come from Florida. Yeah, so that's, you know, and they're bright but so do all of our genes. Right, right. Um, so that was part of their claim and that they were from, you know, part of Europe that was a bit closer to Africanism when they said about Italians in particular, Sicilians, right. They're like, Hey, look where it is. That's why these people are fucking all the time and having babies. True and are lazy and can't work and fight in the bars and get drunk and. Right, right. So, so how do we define these terms? What is white men that's totally changed, but how much of it is great?

Speaker 1:          01:52:55       They realize just how much of it is cultural. So there's that hold on and then, and then I acu. Well, um, I think it does measure something. I think that's real. I do, I really do. I think there was something called the g factor, which it, it, it, it tests, it measures g factors, this thing that was invented, this concept, it's a category, but it's a real category in the world we operate in, which is your ability to do rational thinking, reasoning like math, like writing scholarly essays, you know, I'm sure my g factor is higher sort of than other people's, although I'm terrible at math. So that's yet another problematic wrinkle for these people. Um, but yeah, I, I believe that Iq measures that stuff, that kind of thing. But is that what intelligence is and only as clearly. No, no, no. A lot of variables that Iq test, test, test, test, write the tests, all kinds of intelligence.

Speaker 1:          01:53:54       The test emotional intelligence. Do they test the intelligence of Jimi Hendrix? Do you think he was great at Calculus? I don't know. I sort of doubt it. Was He smart? Was the intelligent clearly in different ones. Clever with a guitar, that's for sure. So then how do you define intelligence? Activity is unquestionably some sort of measurement or expression of intelligence. We separate that off though, and we always have as a society, we shouldn't. That's why you don't do well unless you're really, really, really good if you're just creative in the way we define that and not intelligent in the way Iq tests to find it. There's a. So it's all problematic. Um, and it just, it all it does is it just keeps raising new questions that never has answers. And so that the attempt to. There's this thing that goes on where certain people just need to keep finding racial differences that are innate, biological, fixed that can't be changed.

Speaker 1:          01:54:50       And it's like, first of all, you've never done this because it's so fluid and you're always, you never really answering it. And then what if you had, did finally prove it? What are we going to do with that information? You know, we just recognize that there are variables. Like when you're talking about Polynesian people, are we talking about people from Tonga? Very stout, strong people, samoans tend to be very stout, strong people. I mean, that's a characteristic of actually a positive characteristic that's attributed to people from that area. Do you ignore that? Like how do you address that? Of course not. I would say that people from Polynesia are more likely. Men from Polynesia are more likely to be offensive lineman in the NFL. So your issue is calling it a itself. Yeah. And then attributing other things to it. All I'm saying is guys from there tend to be bigger.

Speaker 1:          01:55:38       Yeah. Hell yeah. No doubt about it. But so what? That's the end of it. Is there a part of the world where people are generally thought to be dumb? Yeah. Africa, the country that are that. The continent we've been talking about that, that's the history of this country. Does the history of Europe, that's the history of the modern world is the belief that people from Africa are dumber than whites. Well, isn't the problem with that? That Africa is also where the pyramids were created. That's what justified. That's what justified slavery. That's what justified colonialism. That's what justifies has justified all sorts of things. Right. So that's the problem here is that these, these attempts to define people by race and by the way, by gender, have done nothing but terrible things. Nothing but terrible things and you can't do it anyway. It's scientific bullshit. It's total superstition is utterly arbitrary.

Speaker 1:          01:56:25       The lines are always being redrawn by the people who do this stuff, so why are you still doing it guys? Like it's where do you draw the Goddamn line? All the people in Africa are black. Really? Egyptians are the same race as people from the Congo as the people from South Africa as the people from Somalia. I mean, how are they the same race? Because it's pigment skin pigment is that the only determination will. It's a fascinating thing when you call people African Americans or call them a Italian Americans because Italy is actually a country. Whereas Africa is a continent. Fantastic. It's, it's weird to call people conduit, right? Because guess what? Italy didn't even exist until the 19th century. I mean it was just a bunch of city states until then and there was no such thing as an Italian. People who lived there didn't call themselves. It wasn't a concept, it wasn't a name.

Speaker 1:          01:57:15       It was nothing. And then they made it into this nation state that they called Italy and then ever since, ever since then, every sorry, but every dipshit Italian American is like really proud of that. I'm Italian. Well that dude that has no meaning really in the deepest history at a some weight meaning sure. But they talk about it as if it's like rooted in nature. Like I love it. They love being a part of that stupid team. Sopranos, the Sopranos. It's tribalism, tribalism. It is tribal and stupid. And if it were just stupid, I wouldn't care. It's that. It has, as I said, it just leads to bad stuff. And it has historically, let's go this popular opinion, the, the idea that there are no races. Oh, okay. So, you know, Mr. Anti academic academic. But this is where academics have actually done their best work.

Speaker 1:          01:58:01       I think so, and this is the second, my second disagreement with Jordan Peterson. He thinks that all this stuff and college campuses that's crazy is because of postmodernism and he doesn't understand postmodernism. Uh, the, what's going on in college campuses as people making all sorts of truth claims about things like race and gender, right? I'm black, therefore I will always be this, that, and the other thing. You're white, therefore you are this, that, and the other thing. No matter what, right? That is actually old modernist scientific racist thinking. That's what these old racist geneticists eugenesis thought back in the day. It's amazing. Again, sjws are actually really, really conservative and ultimately racist. The Social Justice Warriors folks, your listeners must know that something, I don't know the assume that was a shorthand to use. So postmodernism. This is where Jordan Jordan Peterson makes me want to like throw chairs when he talks about, um, comes out of French philosophy, uh, in the 19 sixties and seventies and eighties.

Speaker 1:          01:59:07       Michel Foucault is the most famous example of a, of a French postmodernist and he, they get dumped on all the time, but the central, the central argument that was made by food co and postmodernists was that none of these things are biologically determined that there is no natural essence to anything. That everything is a social construct, which means that we now are free to choose our own destiny as individuals. Right? Prior to that, prior to the 19 sixties and seventies, it was the dominant belief that if you were born a woman, you are going to be a wife and a mother, and if you weren't, you were doing something unnatural, right? That if you were black, you could never be the head of a business or the president, right? You could never do math, whatever. If you were white, you know, you should do all those things, right?

Speaker 1:          02:00:10       Everybody's destiny was determined at birth and everyone believed that. Most people believe that. Okay, so postmodernist came along and said, guess what? You know, what we found looking at history we found is just what I said. I just gave you the whole postmodern argument right there. We looked at history and we saw first of all, that all of these categories have changed over time, which tells us that they're just inventions. They're just inventions that get reinvented all the time. Okay? And second of all, they have served the purposes of ruling elites because they get to put people in their boxes and control them more easily. Right? Oh, those people over there, those are black. Therefore they should be our slaves. So it's okay for us to have a mess. Slaves, those women over there, we don't want them, you know, working for NASA. So we will have a rule against women working for NASA.

Speaker 1:          02:00:59       Whatever it is, right? So postmodern has said, none of this is biological. None of this is inevitable. You are now free to do what you want as an individual. It was a liberating moment. It has become the dominant way of thinking in academia. And I have to say, in my view, it is the supreme achievement of academics ever. That's it. That's it. But it's huge. Huge. So if you think about it, look at how the world has changed particularly in that in the United States since then, right? We no longer generally have those ideas. At least we don't operate as such. So black people are allowed mostly into places they weren't before. Women are allowed very much so into places they weren't allowed before. All the whole world has changed and I think principally from that idea, so the trend, that doesn't mean now the problem is these social justice warriors so called on campuses, have used some of that language and taking a shit on it.

Speaker 1:          02:02:04       So the Trans Movement, for instance, right? That started from postmodernism. That whole idea, right, is that, you know, if you were born with a penis, you're a man and you should do x, y, and z with your life. Right? The Trans Movement needed that needed postmodernism to make that intervention and say, no, that's not true, right? You can actually be a woman because a woman is an invention. It's a social construct. What Trans, much of the Trans Movement now is doing, which makes me so sad, is that they're saying that I am biologically essentially, naturally, you know, in my core, a woman, no, no one is, no one is you can't change. The whole point of this movement used to be that you get to choose your gender or choose not to be a gender. You get to move around. Your destiny is not determined for you what the true. A lot of the Trans Movement now is doing. This is a good word, reifying. They're making these ideas, these abstractions real. Again, they're making these claims that are similar to Sam Harris has claims and to old racist claims and to old sexist claims that if you're born in a particular way, biologically this is who you are, right? Because you've heard a lot of trans people say this, right? I was born a woman. That's where they often say, what I'm saying is no one was born anything.

Speaker 2:          02:03:30       You are losing me in a huge way. Why you don't think that women, that some women are born women and some you don't think you're born a man. No. What are you born? Why you men? For all sorts of reasons, for all sorts of reasons. None of them being just decided. We. None of them being the x, y chromosome. You have testicles. Then we went to and you have a penis. None of them being the fact that you generally gravitate towards male activities like boxing, kickboxing, and we just. We just went through this whole thing. No, you didn't. Well, Romero and Andy. Dick. Yeah, but yeah, they both men. But you. You. You're a man yet, right? We're not talking about the broad spectrum of masculine behavior. We're talking about. No one is born a man. You're not born a man. I'm not born. And I'm saying, no, I think we're getting silly.

Speaker 2:          02:04:13       Hold on here. I think it's the category of men becomes meaningless. Does it? Yeah. We just did this man. No, we didn't. We didn't do well. Romero and Andy Dick or put on category jewelry at the ends of the spectrum and I think they crossover the male female lines do cross over when you get to that Kenyan runner and Andy Dick. Yeah, but that's what I'm saying. It's so broad that it becomes, to me pretty damn meaningless. Well, the numbers are incredibly small. If those crossover marks, you're talking about us. Very, very small percentage of the population.

Speaker 1:          02:04:45       Neither Andy Dick nor you'll ell Ramiro are trans people, right?

Speaker 2:          02:04:50       It might be. They are so different though. Physically in every way. We both put them in this silly category called, man, what the hell is that mean anymore? And he has children. He made them mind, impregnated different women and got babies from a lot of people called men who don't and can't. Can't. Okay. Yeah, but that's rare. They were rare in that way, but it's pretty rare. Not that rare. Oh, it's very rare. Most most men, when they have sex with a woman and they put sperm in their body, they can one maybe. So that's one characteristic, but hold on a second, you're, you're, you're, you're making it as if it's a really common thing when you're talking about like a small fraction of the men can't make babies a incredibly small fraction. So an incredibly vast majority of males with the x, y chromosome who have penises are capable of impregnating a female with an XX chromosome. And the, the male was born a male. The female was born a female, right? So what do you mean? But you aren't born a man or you aren't born a female.

Speaker 1:          02:05:50       Right? So there are many, many characteristics, right? That we assigned to the categories. Many of them. That's one characteristic. Okay, so why? Why is that characteristic in the man category, if in particular that there are some men who don't share that character characteristic,

Speaker 2:          02:06:07       but which ones don't you? That's the aberration. The aberrations, the one operation to see these are all images. Get a woman pregnant. They don't produce sperm. You're talking about like very, very rare cases.

Speaker 1:          02:06:19       Yeah, same with center for race. Same thing happens with sickle cell anemia, right? This is what everybody invokes when they want to claim that race is real. Only black people get sickle cell anemia. Well guess what? The numbers there are about the same as the number of men who are infertile. Why then are people with sickle cell anemia? Definitely black. Why is that? Definitely a black thing. Same thing. It's, you know, again, why are we. There's all these characteristics. Why do we draw this line called man around all those different people?

Speaker 2:          02:06:49       Well, why don't we do it with animals? When you have a male dog and a female dog, isn't there a male dog, a female dog? Eventually there's a male dog and he was saying his inventions. Now, hold on, so before you get, but yeah, no, it is. Of course it's not an invention. One of them has a penis and testicles. It's the thing we see.

Speaker 1:          02:07:05       We call it a penis. Sure, I get it. No, I get it. And that's the world I live in. Absolutely. So I operate in this way, by the way, by the way.

Speaker 2:          02:07:12       So if a dog penis world, you and I would agree on all the things in the world that are dogs right thing. Okay, I'm not, I'm not gonna. Walk around and be like, oh no dude, that's not a dog. So with humans, you're making a distinction that there are certain feelings and the way you interface with the world that may be more or less masculine or feminine, but it does apply to dogs. My point here, which is that we did draw a line right in those. There's this. Do all dogs look alike? My God, there's a huge variation. They're not talking about race though. We're talking about gender, right? Either way, it doesn't matter. Same principle, dobermans, male Dobermans, and female Dobermans, right? You can't. If you go to buy a male Doberman and the guy gives you a female dove men, he goes, oh, but she identifies as being a male.

Speaker 2:          02:07:51       This. It's just an invention, man. This is a male, but she's a male. You can't disrespect for by saying she's not a male. You would say, that guy's crazy and you want your money back. Are there any two females who were identical to female? What? Anything? I mean, if you have a really good breeder, you can get pretty God damn close. If you're talking about dog. No, no, there's no. There are no two into organisms that are identical. Certainly not down to the hair on technicality, but so you can still categorize them as x, y, x chromosomes, and I'm not saying we shouldn't categorize anything ever because we must do that to live in this world. What are you saying? What I am saying is we should probably stop applying certain categories to human beings in the ways we have done. Like how so? Because there were male and male and female, because there are certain inventions, certain social constructs that do nothing but bad things to do.

Speaker 2:          02:08:45       No good, and their only social constructs like race and gender. Well, tell me how race and gender. I'm not worried about Doberman gender definition. Let's look at gender definition and tell me how it's only bad. Why is it only bad to find men as men and women is women? Because if you say it's, it's. It's about making the biological claim, the bright, the biological connection there will making a definition which is saying a guy who was born, a guy who gravitates towards male activities, likes females, all those things. By saying that that's a man that this is a born man and you're saying, no, no one is. So if you're saying, if those characteristics are naturally determined than all, all of us guys who don't do those things are unnatural. Which things are those all the time? All the things that women, whatever it is that you characterize as being male, that's so common with males and what is being attracted to women really aging and with women.

Speaker 2:          02:09:42       Have you heard of gay people? Yes. It's a small percentage of the population of men. Um, is it one percent? Is Four percent? I mean, it's certainly a lot of people, isn't it? It's a lot of people. When you think about the 350 million people we have living in America, sure. Take all them in. Let's do this. Take all the men who are straight up homosexual. Always have to hold on, but you can classify them as gay men. I know. Hold on. So just take that. Whatever that is, if it's one or two or five or 10 percent, whatever it is, I've only been homosexual hundred percent. Never been attracted to a woman period. Okay? Okay, fine. That's still a really significant, significant number. I'm not done. Hang on. Then. Take the men who don't identify as homosexual, have had sex with women, have been attracted to women, but have fucked men prisoners.

Speaker 2:          02:10:27       Pretty Damn big number. They're pretty dense. Oh, wait a minute. How many guys do you think that are attracted to women but still fuck men? So Kinsey, the Kinsey study. Sure. The 19 forties and fifties. Found that it was, I think 30 percent. Yes. Thirty percent of men. Fuck man reached orgasm in a sexual experience with another man. Yes. Thirty percent. Yes. Yes. It was a very large number of was hanging out with freaks. Yup. That's what I think. There were different numbers for women and men, but they were both very significant. Percentages vary. Not Majority's, but very significant percentage as well. I have personally known. I've personally known many men who you would consider straight, who identify as straight, who have done something with men, either given him a blow job, gotten a blow job, had full onset jerk each other off. Jesus. I'm surprised this is news to you.

Speaker 2:          02:11:18       Well, it's news in that way. Even if they did do that. You're talking about individual sexual acts between people who are male or female, right? You're still talking about a man, so talking about a man that's having sex with other men. You're defining it such in that way. You're literally saying, know a guy you are know you are saying. You know guys who sucked other guys' dicks. A guy. He's done it to a guy. You're saying a man do it to a man. Gotcha. I gotcha. I gotcha. No, I'm saying that people who are identified as men, he did. That's what I meant. People who were identified as men by society have done these things, that society has to be unnatural for men, but when they were doing that, weren't they a man doing it to a man? Look what happened to those guys? Historically, not so much recently, but certainly still today, but certainly historically we can't keep going back to 100 plus years.

Speaker 2:          02:12:07       When I was talking about like right now I am still talking about a man who's having a sexual exchange with another man. Like you can be sexually attracted to another man. It doesn't mean that you're both not met. So do you think homosexual men or men? Sure. Why? Because they're male. They have a penis, they have x, y chromosomes. They can get a woman pregnant if they wanted to, could donate their sperm to their lesbian pals and they just eliminated. One of the characteristics that you previously previously said was male. No, no, no. Most men, most are attracted to women, but a good percentage of them are gay and this is not like complicated stuff. There's still men.

Speaker 1:          02:12:47       Yeah. I, I mean, I don't know where to go from here. I mean, I think I've, I think I've made the argument I, it's, it's funny because I thought you were totally with me for like an hour and a half and now it's like, I feel like you're not there.

Speaker 2:          02:13:01       I didn't know what to do. I think there's a giant spectrum of people, but to say that a guy is in born to a man or a woman isn't born a woman I think is disingenuous.

Speaker 1:          02:13:12       Yeah. So it's, it's where the. So. Okay. Thailand, Thailand. I think in India and I think

Speaker 2:          02:13:20       there's several Polynesian countries. There's several countries where there is a legal and cultural and social category

Speaker 1:          02:13:28       that is neither man nor woman, nor male or female. Like in Thailand, the lady boys. Right. And there's other countries to have this. You can look it up. It's either. Sure. Right. Okay. You know about this mission. Okay. Um, what about that? What about those people too? What do you. Oh, well, I think there's that too, so. Oh,

Speaker 3:          02:13:46       okay. I'm saying people can be born a man, but if people can be born a woman or you can get these andy, Dick Yoel Romero. Weird variation. But

Speaker 1:          02:13:55       Joe, take the lady boys from Thailand and move them here to this country. Now, how will they be considered?

Speaker 3:          02:14:04       What do you mean? How will they be? Americans don't have those categories. Okay. We have only two. A lot of variables in Thailand. Also, you're dealing with like really young sex workers. There's a lot of weird shit that goes on in Thailand. A lot of abuse. So as the ladyboy category, real or not, it certainly realizes the Trans category there. They consider that real and here we do not, but if it is real, and I think you agree it's Rio and I agree it's real, right? Trans people, that means there's absolutely people that feel like they're born in the wrong gender, so why isn't a man real? Why is it a woman?

Speaker 1:          02:14:40       If you want to say they're all equally real. I'm down there. We're good. That's what I'm saying, right? It's just that those, that, those categories have no absolute, you know, biological meaning there's not a meeting that they're fluid, they're, you know, basically arbitrary. Sorry, I mean there that we invent them. I'm not saying it's useless, I'm not saying we should never have any categories. I'm just saying that those categories have changed and they changed,

Speaker 3:          02:15:02       but you kind of, depending on where you are in the wild disagreeing with you, you kind of did say that a man is born a man and a woman isn't born and, and for sure a lot of them are for sure. A lot of people that have your stereotypical classic female characteristics were born female and for sure there's a lot of men who have classic, stereotypical male behavior and patterns and desires. They're born men and then there's trans people and then there's also, there's asexual people to Charleston needs to be considered. Here's people that just don't have any desire to fuck anybody. They don't want to. They don't want to be a man or a woman. They can call themselves queer. They can call themselves whatever they want. They don't want to be a female. They don't want to be a male, they just want to be human. Here's the deal.

Speaker 1:          02:15:46       How about let's make a deal if you, if that's what you have to say about it and you want to not get in the way of people doing those things and making those decisions for themselves and let them do what they want to do. I am totally with you. Okay.

Speaker 3:          02:15:58       It's true for sure. I don't want to get in the way of anybody making it. I don't want to get in the way of furries. That's awesome. If you really identify with being a giant squirrel,

Speaker 1:          02:16:05       that's awesome. That's great. And that's really what matters. Um, I'm just saying that claims and I want to end it here, claims about these essential characteristics that it's biologically determined, right? You know, are the things that reinforce getting in the way. Laws, policies, cultures, ideas, norms that get in the way of people doing what they want to do with their own lives. MM, right.

Speaker 3:          02:16:32       Because yeah, for sure with some people will be. Variables are so extreme and the spectrum is so broad.

Speaker 1:          02:16:39       So after I was on your show the first time, a got a whole bunch of comments from people calling me a fag and a pussy and a sissy and a this and that. Read those feminizing me. And it's not your fault for calling me a girl. You can't read those. I know, I know. It's whatever. I don't know. I mean people like came to twitter and whatever. Yeah. You don't read those? No, I stopped. I learned. Oh yeah. Stopped. I don't do anymore. I didn't matter. I didn't care. This didn't bother me at all. I just thought it was interesting. I actually agreed so in other words, and a lot of them they were really saying and some of them elaborated on this was that I was not really man enough. Right. I was less of a man for whatever reason. I don't know. I don't care. It's fine. I liked it. It was funny, but it really proves my point is that these things are very fluid. So they kind of were kicking me out of the category of Man and I was like, cool, please.

Speaker 3:          02:17:24       I think they were trying to get a ride, so I now I don't think you could make a rational argument dealing with Internet.

Speaker 1:          02:17:31       No, of course not. I'm saying it's just one example of what goes on generally, which is that we do this all the time, right?

Speaker 3:          02:17:36       Yeah, but they're not even human. Like when someone's interacting with you like that, it's lacking all of the characteristics of human interaction. You're not there with a person. You're not looking at them. If someone was in front of you like that, oh, you're a fag. You, you'd be like, Oh my God, I'm in danger. There's a crazy person might have to defend myself against this person because if someone is treating me that way, insulting me, looking me in the eye. We're so close to violence like anything can happen here. I guess as a person. That's not rational. It is amazing, isn't it?

Speaker 1:          02:18:03       Talking to my son as we were driving over here, because you know he, he reads, he, he read all the comments when I was on your shows and he was like, it was so fun. Is like, toby, don't read that shit man. It's just, it's funny. Uh, but uh, it is remarkable how many people do that. Right? And it's not just that they have these thoughts about you, it's that they go out of their way to write it in public to do something that they'll actually sit down. That's what boggles my mind is that someone will actually take the time and energy to like sit there and write this thing on youtube or whatever you know about, you know, this or that about me. It's phenomenal.

Speaker 3:          02:18:38       Sometimes people have good points. No. Sometimes they're not. Even when they're insulting you, sometimes they're making points while they're insulting you. It's just hard to separate the wheat from the chaff. Yeah. It's, it's a weird way of interacting with people that didn't exist. I mean, there was never a time in our past where you could with real time during real instantaneously send something to someone and then they read it right away and they could be rude and all they are is a twitter egg with a bunch of numbers and letters and they call you a homo and it's the real downside of the Internet, which otherwise is a miraculous boon to humanity. I feel like it's an adolescent stage. I feel like we are finding our way through this inescapable new technology, this, this connection that we're sharing, which is just. Well, it's one of the reasons why I think it's to have

Speaker 2:          02:19:28       one on one conversations with people and one of the things that I've noticed from doing this podcast is how how many interesting people there are there out there in the world like yourself that I could talk to, but also how bad most people are in the world. We're just talking to each other. We don't ever have long conversations. Everybody's checking their fucking phone. Everybody's watching a television. It's worry about that because I'm very pro technology and all this stuff, but that does worry me. I want to go into a restaurant and I see people sitting at the same table all looking at their phones. Oh yeah. Like 70 precedent. It's still like a group of seven that's pressing and I and I have wondered about the quality of conversation generally because just what you're saying. Yeah. I've been wondering and thinking it might actually be declining.

Speaker 2:          02:20:11       The quality of our conversations. Personally. I definitely think it is. I find myself continually disappointed with very smart people that I meet that don't have real conversation. They talk over people. They don't. They're not listening. They're not responding to what you're saying. They're waiting for you to stop talking so they can talk and it's like, it's like this self centered sort of way of interacting with each other. That seems more prevalent than not. I'm used to that because I'm around academics a lot because they're used to lecturing and that they're the smartest person in the room and so all their job is to do is to tell us what's true. Right? So they're, they're very comfortable with that. I was always amazed when I'd watch these are really important famous professors at Columbia, you know, give these lectures to the hall of 500 people in.

Speaker 2:          02:20:56       It seemed to me they didn't even know that there are other people in the room the way they were talking. Like it didn't matter what the reactions were, whether people were asleep, whether they're reading the newspaper, they just didn't care. They just kept going. He kept talking to talk and talk for two hours straight ahead. You know, I just, I can't do that. I'm the exact opposite. I panic if I feel like the person I'm talking to isn't listening to me. That's good. I panic. Yeah. And so when I see if I'm lecturing to 200 students, I see one kid kind of just get a little distracted. I freak and I feel like I have to up my game right then and I have to go directly address them. That means you care. Yeah. I mean, whatever it is, I care in a particular way.

Speaker 2:          02:21:31       I mean, it's some, it's another form of narcissism I suppose, but I really, I do think that's what makes me a good teacher because I, I have to have interaction will you want to connect, they need to know what you're hearing, right? I need to know what you're hearing from me. That's the thing, and then we can really talk and then I also am really curious. I'm just a curious person and I want to know what you're thinking and let's do this, you know, let's. And then let's have that chemistry that happened just now, which got hot, you know, but like that's, that's where life is. That's where real personal relationships are. Yeah. Comics kind of do the same thing too because they're used to being the one who's talking on stage or if they do a podcast, they're used to being the one who's talking all the time. The ones who do crowd work. Right. Amazing. If you think about it, if they're the ones who interact, have a whole part of their act where it's crowd work. Most comics, I mean don't they have some indirect? Yeah, definitely the interaction with the crowd and happens a lot. I mean you're dealing with people drinking alcohol

Speaker 1:          02:22:26       in a social environment and it's dark out and it's nighttime and they're having fun and they're laughing and and especially when you're talking about controversial opinions in subjects, people always, all the comics talk about, you know, you feel the room, you feel that interaction. I'm saying I'm talking about these professors and they're tweed jackets at Columbia. I swear to God it didn't matter what happened, what was happening and the lecturer is a certain amount of arrogance and I'm sure you must get after being a professor, it's a particular narcissism. They live entirely in their heads, right? They just sit in their study and read books and then they go out and then give a lecture and then they come back and read this, read the book and you know, it's a weird narcissism. I can't really get to interact with other professors and go over there, work together.

Speaker 1:          02:23:07       You know, I am stereotyping and generalizing. This is not everybody, but I did see this a lot and I still do. Yeah, there's some interactions, but again, it's mostly through, you know, you write a paper and then you send it out to the journal and then some other professor reviews it write anonymously often and sends it back. It's all very weird passive aggressive shit too. Like that's the other thing about academia I can't stand is that they are allergic to direct conflict. Like the argument you and I just had, that's pretty much not allowed except through writing. They'll do it through writing, but they won't do it head to head. That's a real problem because it takes too long to work out an idea that way. Yeah. Like real debate. When I went to college I had this idea that it would be really smart people, like professors, like more than one would be in a room and they would have, you know, one major issue and they would debate it that there would be argument, right.

Speaker 1:          02:24:01       There'll be conflict of ideas about an idea. No, it's not that. It's never that I have been in and around college campuses for 32 years. I have never really seen a head to head debate. Like even I just had, that's insane. Person to person, I mean here and there a little bit, but not like that. Not what we're really, really going at it. I don't think I've ever seen that. I mean the enemy among faculty. Some students do, but faculty don't. They're scared of it. I'm telling you, there's a problem with cowardice and one of the real tragedies with that is that as I said, there's no real conflict of ideas which is reinforced by the tenure system, the accreditation system. It's a, it's this monolith where there's one, and this is why you get this uniformity, the uniformity of the ideas on campuses. It's all this monolith that actually has its head at the federal government.

Speaker 1:          02:24:58       Do you know about the accreditation system? Would it be? If it's the mafia, people don't even know this. To get accredited as a college or university in this country, you have to be accredited by an agency that is, that is authorized by the Department of Education in Washington DC. The secretary of Education has to authorize your existence as a legitimate legal college or university. That's it. So renegade university people were asking me, they wanted me, they want some people want to call it credit and I was like, Oh, let me look into this. And so I did and I quickly found out that it's the fucking mafia that I couldn't get accredited because they have all these, they have all these standards. You have to have a particular number of buildings, a particular number of professors. You have to have a library with a particular number of books in it.

Speaker 1:          02:25:51       You have to have a gym, you have to drop all these things and if you don't have those things you're not in, you don't get that. You don't get college credit, no other. So what if you did like I gave you five credits for taking one of my courses? No other college and university would recognize it if you want it to transfer, like you wanted to go to graduate school or go somewhere else, do something. No, employers would look at it and see that it's not an accredited university where you've got those credits from. So how do those degree mills, how do they do it? Right. So there's two different systems at the Department of Education controls. One is for the so called elite prestigious schools. Those are regional accreditation agencies. Again, all authorized by the Department of Education and the for profit colleges. There's a separate accreditation system called the national accreditation system and that's also controlled by the department of education, but everybody knows within it that if you get, if you get accredited by one of the national accreditation system, zero bullshit for profit the Greenville.

Speaker 1:          02:26:50       So those credits, you can't transfer them to Harvard or occidental or any of the of the elite so called elite schools. So they're completely kept separate. But you can't even if you get a degree from like Phoenix University, you know that you can't. You can get 5,000 degrees from Phoenix University. My degree is, I can't take anywhere and I'm talking about even even community colleges won't accept those credits. Yeah, that's interesting. It's the mafia. So think about that, right? The Department of Education, one person, federal government decides who's in, who's out, and then inside that system there's tenure, lifetime appointment. Those people control the curriculum, what is taught. They also control who's hired and fired faculty control all the hiring and firing of faculty and tenure. They ultimately control that basically. Right. And they're there forever like dawns in the Mafia. Seriously. So you wonder why when you walk into any college classroom in this country, you hear basically the same shit being said and sociology classes and history classes. That's why it's astonishing. And I didn't even know the full extent of it until I started renegade university and people started asking me about this. What if you were, if someone allowed you to come along, if Donald Trump said that, he says, I love your work. Uh, what, what could you do to fix that? What would you offer as an alternative? We have to change it. No, there's nothing I do. I mean meaning,

Speaker 2:          02:28:22       if he wanted credit, like college credit, right now there's really nothing I can do. I can certainly give them a certificate and maybe an employer will think it's meaningful because my name's on it. Is it less and less valuable to have a degree today? I'm saying I'm just completely outside the system. Right, I understand. Yeah. But like, if you, if you admired me and my work right, and you saw and I had and he had a certificate saying this guy's great and he took my course, you as an employer, it would actually help. Sure. And then in that case it would be meaningful. My credits, I'm just saying that's completely outside. It means nothing inside the system of the thousands and thousands of colleges and universities. And for most employers, right? Most employers abide by this. They think that if you're not accredited, your bullshit.

Speaker 2:          02:29:08       So we have to change it. And Betsy devoss for whatever her problems are, seems to be the first secretary of education maybe we've ever had who could be willing to challenge this. Really? Yeah. Because she's about deregulation and privatization and all this stuff and choice school choice. Um, and we need a movement right now before she's gone to get her to abolish the national accreditation system all with a stroke of a pen, I think. And maybe a congressional act probably takes a congressional act to. But she herself I think could discredit. Yeah, I'm pretty sure she could discredit all those agencies right now. So you think there's just this inherent bottleneck that it's existed for so long and that these people have been in charge of saying what is true and what's not true? What should it be taught in monopoly, a monopoly ultimately controlled by the federal government that it's also not universally agreed that they're correct.

Speaker 2:          02:30:05       Correct. Correct. In what they're teaching and it's not like there's a, an absolute standard for what needs to be taught if someone wants to get into. No, no, there are up. I mean there are absolute standards. This is what I'm saying, like you have to have this, that, and the other thing on your college campus to be accredited. No, that's what I mean. I mean, in terms of like what is, uh, what, what constitutes a master's degree in literature, right. Like, is there an absolute standard? Yeah, for the. Yes. The, well, they're pretty absolute. I mean, accreditation agencies mostly agree on those things. So why couldn't you just reproduce that in an environment where you're being taught by someone who obviously has a mastery of that particular subject? That's what Joe. That's what I'm doing. Yeah, that's what we're doing. Well, that's what's happened. It's not just me, right?

Speaker 2:          02:30:49       I'm, I'm, you know, one of the pioneers. But it's happening. How many other people are doing what? You're doing a handful. I mean, but it's becoming a new Jordan Peterson is actually looking at. When I heard him talking about that on your show, I said, go for it, man. Yeah. Well he didn't grant. We know what he said. He was no criticism at all. I didn't know this either until recently. He, he had this idea. What was it about accreditation? He thought it was possible somehow to get accredited, but it's not. You can't. We have to start an entirely separate parallel, different system Canada. Uh, possibly it could be. That could be credited and possible. But anyway, regardless, I am all for him doing that. I hope he does. I will tell you, it was recently denied. A grant for the first time is Debit Korea. I'm sure they're not playing around.

Speaker 2:          02:31:30       They're not playing around on this is their castle. They're not going to let us. The Naves in. Well, what's interesting is because of social media, because of coming on podcasts like mine and his youtube presence, he's actually got a large movement of people that are interested in his ideas. He had a disastrous fucking conversation with Sam Harris. I don't know if I heard it. I did. What in the fuck was that all about? Well, he's holding onto God. Well, the first one wasn't even that. It was about truth. That was God though. It was. Yeah, because Jordan had religious and he believes he's religious, so he wants to hold onto this idea about what is truth being valuable for humankind versus what is truth. Like one plus one equals two. Right. Moral moral truth versus I was kind of on either side and that one was so verbose but was too many words.

Speaker 2:          02:32:20       It was like, you guys gotTa fucking edit this down. It was tough with Jordan had to boil it down and they did a way better podcast the second time. Did you hear the second one? Much, much better. Much more concise. Much clear, but that again, this, I think there was this certain amount of healed digging on both sides. They dug their heels in, they stood their ground. This one really preposterous issue, which just like, you know, you're listening to this like Jesus fucking Christ. Guys, you just talking about truth for an hour and a half. Like, what is truth? Here's what's true. Fire Burns paper. That's fucking true. Okay. Like take a piece of paper. Write it on fire. So stop. Goddammit. You're going to make me go again. I don't want to have this conversation now. It's really important, but let's leave it there as well. So I did agree with them, Sam and Jordan.

Speaker 2:          02:33:04       That is really important. I just disagree with them about what, what's going on. But anyway, um, the definition of the word true, but you know what should be, they should have had more leeway on both sides with that. Yeah. Anyway, so either way, here's the thing, he said, fascinating guy. Totally. I have major disagreements with Sam Jordan, but there's still heroic and I'm totally with them because they are doing this. I mean Sam's not doing it formally, but he's essentially part of this movement. You're a part of this movement. You know what the Donald, you know what the election was about. It was about a civil war in this country that's been going on for a long time. That finally came to a head in November, which is a war between the people who went to college and the elite colleges in particular and who are of that culture that's created in those colleges and those who are not of that culture. That's what that. That's what that election was about. I think there is this schism between those two groups in this country and that finally the people who are not of the elite college culture one something and it caused the elites to freak completely out. So if you look at, like I was looking at the top podcast because I just started a podcast and it did get ranked and so I'm excited but I'm looking at it a lot and like you can really see it clearly to look at the top 200

Speaker 1:          02:34:18       podcasts right now. It's like 60 to 70 percent are like NPR, cookie cutter, same shit. Coastal elite, liberal bland, you know, you know what it is, tone of voice, what they say, who their guests are. All the same. You know exactly what it is, right? Is dominated by that. But then there's you in there. You're not that. There's Sam Harris who sort of that, but not really. You know, there's Dan Carlin here, there's another one, right? He's part of this movement. He doesn't have a school, but he's teaching people history. Oh fuck. Teaching people history. A lot of people history, more people than any historic. A Harvard professor will ever teach you more than any historian, more way more. He gets millions of downloads. Way History lecture. Is anybody in the numbers like millions producing? Does he? Is he a serious historian? I've listened to him. I'm a professionally trained historian, Ivy League Phd.

Speaker 1:          02:35:11       Hell yeah. He is. You know, I don't agree with everything, but it doesn't matter. He's doing serious academic, professional, important history and he is changing the landscape. I agree. Okay. He's on there, so there's. Some of us were there, some of us we're making, we're making it happen, but you can just see as such a divide, like there's just such a divide between like who, who's on your podcast and who's on the NPR podcasts is hardly any crossover. Yeah, but that's just my choice. Interesting. That could know those people. There's a lot of people that I get that are on NPR podcasts. My point is that there's sort of two different cultures that's happening right now. There's just that culture like, and this is kind of a problem with my girlfriend and I have because she's of that culture. Most of the people I know are npr types, you know, that's what they want to hear.

Speaker 1:          02:35:57       It's comforting and soothing, whatever. It makes them feel good. I don't know, but they're really. That's who they are. Fundamentally. It's like their identity and then, you know, when they hear your podcast or my podcast or anyone's, it's, it's like, it's like a punk rock to a 80 year old. It's just hard. It's just different culture, different language, different way of behaving, different ideas or questions, different questions are asked. Um, and there's, there's this resentment to, because the elites, the MPR types I believe have basically looked, not basically they have looked down their noses at those who didn't go to college who don't speak the way we speak, who don't talk about these ideas, who aren't aware of these ideas. Right? Working class people like people in Salem. I know people who, Oh, you know, Meryl Streep said at best, right about mma, right St. that's, that was it right there. They clearly see all those people outside this elite by coastal culture as doing bad stuff, inferior stuff, and they shouldn't be allowed to run things. She said was so inherently ridiculous and also ignorant because she was also claiming that if you take out the immigrants, you're left with mma. MMA is 80 percent immigrants. Sure. Literally. Well, what she said was,

Speaker 3:          02:37:16       was stupid, ignorant, and more importantly, I think classist in that way. Right? It's like, you're not smart enough. You're not good enough. She's so wrong. Like there's a lot of Americans that engaged now in May for sure, but there's so many great fighters that are immigrants. I mean a massive, massive amounts. It's not small mouth, so she was saying, take out all the immigrants you left with mma. That is so dumb, but you know what those people do with the. The immigrants who do things like mma, they ignore them. They pretend. They pretend they don't exist. It doesn't fit the narrow narrative. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          02:37:51       Is the immigrant who also very much exists. They want the undocumented mom with the kid who got stopped at the border and sent back. Who breaks my heart too?

Speaker 3:          02:37:59       Yeah, my two. Absolutely, but they want them only to be what? Victims. What's the solution to that? That they can say, what is the solution to illegal immigration in this country? Do you just let everybody in? I'm an open border sky. Yeah. Open borders. Just let anybody in who wants to come meeting of inventions and social constructs that have done great harm to humanity. Borders, borders. Yeah. I agree that eventually that's going to be a thing of the past. I think there'll be a looked back when we look back at history. It'll be thought of as one of the most barbaric ideas, right? Can you imagine? Let's say it's barbaric and the way that it used to be that you had a tribe, then you invaded another tribe or they invaded you and you had to put up a fence and guard your border and then these things became like larger communities as communities became. Cities became countries became and then you go back a few thousand years. You're dealing with these countries invading other countries and so you have these, these, uh, immigration policies, especially now where we have border patrols and this idea that you have to have your paperwork and you have to have passports and numbers and otherwise you, you were born in the wrong patch of dirt. Sir. If you were just born 30 miles north, you could have been in Texas, but you're in Juarez. You fuck, so you stay over here. It's, it's silly.

Speaker 1:          02:39:11       Speaking of social constructions and social constructions that have changed over time, right? It's damn telling a Mexican they can't come here. Are you crazy like this was Mexico five minutes ago. You assholes. Who the fuck are you finishing the arrogance of Americans who think that Mexicans have no place here? I mean, there weren't no white people here long.

Speaker 3:          02:39:32       Well, it not only that, I mean you just got lucky you're, you were born into this like economically prov promising area where you know, you gotta better opportunities. Sure. And you're looking at these people that are born in a shit spot and you're like, well, you're in that shit spot forever. You can't come over here and take my good spot.

Speaker 1:          02:39:50       It also works against us because then it becomes harder for us to travel elsewhere because then they have borders. They don't like Americans because of what we do to them. When I go to Mexico in a, I just like, I love it there and I keep thinking, man, it's amazing that you're treating me this well because the Mexicans are so kind. Generally, you know, when you're down there and like, God, you should hate Americans. Wha What we've done to them in terms of the border integration and that drug war. I mean, the deaths, the poverty that we've inflicted on them through these laws are shitty policy. My God, I mean they have every reason to hate our guts and they don't. Yeah, well no. Mexicans overall are very kind people. My parents live in Mexico. Really? Yeah. I didn't know that. Yeah. I love Mexico.

Speaker 1:          02:40:33       I love it. I going to Mexico all the time and credible place. I try to go out of my favorite places to go on vacation for sure. And I know a lot of people. I have a lot of friends here. They're scared. They're scared of Mexico. I think Mexico is all gang violence and all that. I'm like, wow, read about Chicago. You're not scared to go to Chicago. Chicago was fucking murders every day. That's a good point. I want to trump Chicago, Mexico violence. You know what he was saying about these illegal immigrants being violent criminals and stuff. He wasn't wrong entirely. A, here's what. Here's what people are ignoring that it's true that the cartels have moved into the Midwest. You know about this in particular Chicago, that Chapo and others too. They have moved into the Midwest there in Kentucky. Do a google search for like Mexican cartel and pick like a town in Kentucky and Ohio, Indiana.

Speaker 1:          02:41:22       They're all over the midwest and they're competing. They're kicking out the old gangs and that's why there's all this violence on the streets. A lot of those black kids in Chicago who are shooting each other are working for one of those cartels basically, so trump was right about that, but he's totally wrong about the answer to it and what liberals do in response to it is even worse, which is pretend it's not happening. Yeah, no, people are killing each other, but why? Why? Because drugs are illegal. Yes, because drugs are illegal and we want them to be illegal. We vote for those laws. Well, I met a guy in Chicago who was a cop and he explained it to me in great detail and he said essentially what happened is they moved in and they arrested a lot of these drug lords, these local people that were in charge of whatever areas and they were running whatever criminal organization.

Speaker 1:          02:42:10       They arrest them and they created a power vacuum and the way he was saying, he's like, it's no different than when we remove a dictator in some foreign country that people move in and then it creates violence. You get isis. Exactly, exactly. Yeah. So, but you don't hear people talking about this. Right. It's incredible. That's what's going on. Yes. The cartels are here. Yes. Trump has drugs. Really trump is too god damn dumb to make the full point and he's also beholden to these asshole republicans like jeff sessions who thinks that I think that marijuana is dangerous. He wants to bring back. So he's not saying he's not. He has no idea, or at least he's not saying what the actual causes. Right. And Liberals are sort of a betting him by ignoring it, but saying, well no, there is no violence. It's like no fuckers.

Speaker 1:          02:42:50       There is tremendous violence and that cause is your laws against drugs. Right? So the answer is really simple. It's in glass trucks. Yeah. Yeah. So, but because, because our government is just a fight between this moron trump and these morons, the Democrats who refused to address this stuff, there's no discussion about it. But if you do legalized drugs, like how do you do that? Like say if the United States just decided we're going to decriminalize all drugs and now that's not good enough because someone's going to sell them. Right? You can't just decriminalize them, but that just keeps people from getting arrested, which is a great step. A good, a good move in the right direction. There's some insane number of people in America that are in prison right now for nonviolent drug offenses. Yeah, it's a, it's a nutty number. That's a side note, but a really important one.

Speaker 1:          02:43:40       There is now a debate among academics who study this stuff, uh, and a lot of academics who are actually more or less on the right side of this are arguing that the drug war and, and making drugs illegal is not the major cause of mass incarceration because the number, the percentage of people it is big, but it's something like 10 percent who are nonviolent drug offenders who were, who were prosecuted and convicted of just drug offenses. That is a relatively small number, but what they're not taking into account is all of the other crimes that stem from drugs being illegal. Right? So all the murders, all the assault, the violent take, all the homicides in this country. Right. I want to see a number, but I'm sure it's really high of how many were committed by a gang member. Okay. And how many of the gangs in the United States basically started by selling drugs?

Speaker 1:          02:44:29       Right, right. Okay. There's that homicides, assault gangs, drugs, there is larceny theft. People who are hooked on drugs who are broke in large part because drug prices are so high. Why are they so high? Because they're illegal. Right, right. They have to get them on. The black market always raises prices, so they're forced to steal because they're poor people. Right. So a huge percentage and they don't track this because the convictions are, you know, if it's, if it's a junkie who steals from somebody to score, they don't count that as a drug crime. They counted as just Larson a. So we don't know, but I am sure, and this is what social scientists need to do right now is start to make that, do that work and find out exactly how many people are in prison for some reason related to the fact that drugs are illegal and a Betcha it's a huge number.

Speaker 1:          02:45:21       Yeah, I bet you're right. It's also like these gangs, if they don't sell drugs, they have no other method of income because they're just knocking over trucks filled with equipment and then reselling it. Like where, what are they doing? They have no income. They have no power. Exactly. Right. Yeah. So I mean the mafia in the 19 twenties was enormously powerful. Hugely powerful. Why? Because the prohibition. Exactly. So that's you take away. I said, I've said this to people like, um, what was, um, the great netflix series was about him, the huge drug. No champion. Narcos. Yup. It goes, was named Paul Escobar Escobar Escobar. So take make drugs you make. If drugs were legal, how many people did Escobar kill? None or two or one or something, right? I mean he killed thousands of people. Right? But if they're legal, here's the

Speaker 2:          02:46:10       deal, like who's profiting off of those? Right. That's where it gets really slippery. If you make drugs legal and then there's got to be, like right now, the people that are selling them are criminals, right? If they're not, if you make it illegal, they're going to still sell them. Like they're just going to sell them legally. Like, like how do you make this transition between drugs being legal and then people being able to sell them. Like how does that work? How do you do that in an orderly way? How do you preserve sanity and humanity and civilization? What do you mean? Nineteen, 33. They ended prohibition. Yeah. But alcohol was something that did though. What's that? They regulated it heavily. [inaudible], which made which created new problems, it caused the state to be all up in our business and all sorts of ways, so like you had to get licensed to sell alcohol, right?

Speaker 2:          02:46:59       Which is what that meant was an inspector from the state came to your bar or restaurant or whatever and looked around and asked you questions and checked on who we're hiring, who worked there, who your customers were, what kinds of customers, and if you didn't fit all the rules of polite society or in. This was true. Great histories have been done about this. If you had the homosexuals coming into your bar, Oh, drunk, homos. You don't want that for the prostitutes or the prostitutes coming into your bar, or even women who were a little bit loose with their morality. You didn't get a license. Really? Yes. Women could stop you from getting a bar license. Absolutely. Boy, I don't know what kind of world we live in telling you, so just decriminalize. We will be fine, but if you just decriminalized who's selling it, right, it's still going to be illegal to sell.

Speaker 2:          02:47:46       No. Right. Decriminalization doesn't mean legalization in terms of profitability, right? Mexico. Do you know that all drugs essentially or decriminalized in Mexico, including mushrooms, acid. These are those definitions changed according to the industry, which is a pain in the ass. But so sometimes decrim means just no laws at all. No, none. Legalization usually means not always, but usually means regulations. Like what happened with. Yeah. So like with weed, we've got legal, we've got legalized and it's heavily regulated and Cetera, but it also was not that heavily were regulated in Colorado it's pretty easy to get. I thought it was while the regulation comes in the banking, the banking is weird because the federal government still has it classified as a schedule one substance and it's illegal. So there's a huge issue isn't it? For people having an accept cash only. So they hired a bunch of seals and burkes and all these fucking guys from like, you know, that would have probably worked for like a mercenary organizations. Now they're fucking Karen round drug money from people selling pot and then they have to take it to the bank and put it in safe deposit boxes. And deposited into these accounts in weird ways. It's very fucking. It's really problematic. And that keeps a lot of people out of the market, out of participating in this. It hire soldiers, you know, stuff that peaceful unemployment program. That's great. That's what we need more, more hired. Uh,

Speaker 1:          02:49:08       isn't it true that they give them jobs? You don't want them not having jobs. And that's true. Once you teach people how to kill people, we'll be nice to them. I certainly would rather them do that. Then killing Iraqis, they also disallowed people with prior felonies from participating in the industry. Is that true? In Colorado, which I've seen this and that meant it's all white. I do not know that. All the, all the. Well there's a lot of black producers. Celanese racist bastard. How dare you got assigned to you? That was a, that was a complete, like Huffington post item, I just know. Right. And you call it racist. Wow. I don't know what to do now. Have a system or a salon. It's kind of a salon.com. Not Man. I'm all right, man. We did just did three hours am. No Way. Flew by letting before 30.
