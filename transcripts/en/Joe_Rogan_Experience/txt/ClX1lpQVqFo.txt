I mean it's just people going down left and right. Getting headless and fucking body pack. It was safe before safe. It's interesting when a culture like drastically changes over a fairly short period of time. I used to go to Mexico and we just go to the spring break thing on TV in like the late nineties you know, maybe like two, maybe even the early two thousands it was like no big deal. Yeah, it was for fear factor. The gride. Yeah.

I always felt like if we're going to have a nickname, you can't really nicknamed herself knowing his nickname is fuck this here folks made your own nickname up. It means you have no friends. That's the only thing it means. It doesn't make any sense. Other than that, you're a crazy person. Crazy person.
