Speaker 1:          00:00:01       Yeah, he's a, I think he's too smart, too smart to talk to regular people.

Speaker 1:          00:00:08       Boom. Powerful big wave surfer. How are you buddy? I'm great. We just got back from playing little techno hunt. We did manage a greatest thing of all time, right? I was just saying I don't care what the price is. It's worth it. It's a bargain at twice the price of whatever it is. Yeah. Where people don't know what it is. It's his game that it simulates bowhunting. So what it is, is, is a giant screen that's made out of Kevlar and then uh, it's got us like a projector projects, hd images of elk and deer. You could set it up for a bunch of different animals, but elk and deer walk across the screen and you shoot at them and it's like the perfect. There's a, we show a little video, Shane bannon earlier. It's really cool, man. It's a perfect practice for bow hunting because one of the things about bow hunting is you get nervous and the more you could do something like this, we just shot a perfect shot. The more you could do that. Over and over and over again, the more it becomes ingrained in your, your, your nervous system, ingrained in your muscles, ingrained in your memory, and then it becomes natural. Yeah, it's awesome. Yeah, it's pretty dope. We're going to make this podcast about 15 minutes long. Go back and shit. Yeah, that's what we were actually talking about. Cutting off the podcast. Short for that. So tell me about this movie man.

Speaker 2:          00:01:23       Yeah. So I'm in La for the premier, the HBO Premiere of the Momentum Generation. It's a, it's a, uh, it's a sports documentary that, that, uh, that Hbo and Robert Redford did. So it's cool, man. It's, it's, it's really cool. It's um, it's a story about my friends and I, we, you know, we all grew up a competitive surfers and in high school we all sort of met each other through, through competitions competing. So this tells a story of how he, basically, how we met, how we grew up, um, and how we became friends and family basically like traveling around the world, you know, together as basically like little kids with no with no chaperones on, on tour around the world. So it's fucking crazy. It's, it's a, it's a wild story. Pulled us up to keep this like a fist away. How old were you when you first started surfing? Started surfing on a standup surfboard when I was five. And when did you start traveling? Serve?

Speaker 2:          00:02:16       When I was 12, I went to England for the world amateur championships. So I was on the Hawaii Team doing this traveling surfing thing most of your life? Yeah. Wow, that's crazy. That is nuts, man. I been, I been putting my surfboards in a board bag and walking out the door with my passport since I was 12 and going to so many different destinations around the world, literally just for surfing wire nuts does such a crazy way to grow up and that. That's a cool thing about the film is all of us have that in common and it's crazy the way the story set up too because there's so many things in it that I didn't really realize were happening at the time. Like, like I came from,

Speaker 3:          00:03:01       I came from a broken family, alcoholic father, kind of radical situation at home and then like a lot of us had like broken families, a lot of us had that in common so we sort of have like this weird fucked up family dynamic in common. So we all became sort of like our own family on the road. So we were competing for a world title. We're all competing and going around the world all the time, staying together. So we became best friends like this nucleus of surfers and we all just became ultra close and then when things get really serious with a surfing competition and there was a lot on the line with sponsors and money and big brands coming in. The shit hit the fan. And then we started like breaking up. It got two series. It was almost like a band who just couldn't stand each other anymore or things got too radical, you know, girls got in the way or money got in the way.

Speaker 3:          00:03:49       And so there was like this kinda like breaking up element, you know, throughout our group. Wow. I would imagine when you're living like that, those people must be so valuable for you though. People that can understand your way of life because it's their way of life too, because like to to a regular person who commutes every day and goes to an office comes home like your life is alien. Yeah, it is. I still get like, I still get uncomfortable when people asked me what I do for a living, you know, like I'll be in like a normal random setting and some of you, the Leo, what do you do for a living? And I'm like, no, do not ask me that because nobody understands. You know? It's like, what do you tell them? I tell them the truth, but it's, I just always tell them like it's, it's really hard to explain.

Speaker 3:          00:04:38       But I served for a living and do, what the fuck is that? Yeah. Did they go? How does that work? How do you get paid? Yes. All the time. And I just go. I have no idea. Well, you don't really compete any longer right now. Just not at all ride big waves. I do. All right. Big Waves, that's my focus and I also write all kinds of waves. I surf every day and you know, the waves don't get big that often when the waves are biggest, I'm on it. Yeah. For a person that like is just meeting you for the first time and doesn't understand surfing and is trying to wrap their head around making a living, riding the waves of the ocean. It was a house wife. Wait a minute. No, I went to accounting school and I and I don't have, there's not like a, there's nothing.

Speaker 3:          00:05:23       I mean there's, there's not like another category I can really point to, to, to, to make the point go quicker to. There's not like, um, you know, it's like there's basketball players and football players and all of them were like scoring goals and getting these brand endorsements from that, from competition element. So because I'm a free surfer who doesn't compete at all, it's just, it's hard to wrap your head around, but they've been harder. Yeah. Basically, I, you know, I, I, I, uh, you know, I have a, a large surfing profile and so like I work with a lot of brands and that's just the kind of, the way it works. It just sponsors. Yep. Yeah. Now this movie, this documentary, did they have footage of you guys from when you were really young? Oh yeah, yeah, they do. Is that weird watching that stuff?

Speaker 3:          00:06:07       Yeah, very weird because we're all in our forties now. We all got kids and for most of us, except for Kelly Kelly still going, you 40, 46 years old. I, I, I saw him on your show the other day is pretty classic, but so, so he's like a focal point in the film. He's, he's part of the momentum generation and um, and so he, there is incredible footage of him when he's nine years old or 10 years old and he's in Florida, like a little rat, like a little sunburn rat and it's neat. You know what I mean? I mean we all had that in common. That's we, we all grew up in, in different places and then we all fell in love with surfing, you know, separately, and then we all just became super tight, so. Wow. It was great. It's a, it's great. And then now we're all like best friends again because there's no, there's no points on a line or a world title on the line or like brands getting in the way or girls getting in the way. We're all, we're all, you know, we're finally growing up that. I mean that had to be strange though to be so tight and then everything sort of get bottlenecked by the pressure. Yup.

Speaker 3:          00:07:10       Anything serving, how much pressure could there be? But you know, we're all trying to make a living, right? It's like, no, you know, that was our dream to surf as much as possible and see the world and that's the only way you could do it for us. Whenever there's competition, there's got to be massive amounts of pressure. Whenever there's someone trying to achieve something or someone trying to rise to the top of a profession and you're surrounded by a bunch, but you also must have pushed each other to and it must have been beneficial to have people like you around as well. I think it's part of,

Speaker 3:          00:07:42       it's just, you know, I think it's like part of our, our human DNA to, you know, to be naturally competitive. So I think especially men, I think that we feel like we have something to prove, you know, like where we stand compared to the other guys were, whether it was like in the cave man days or, or like the, you know, the first hunters. Whereas it was like for sure they were there. They were competitive too so you could bring home meat for the, for the tribe. And then it just kept going from there. And, and, and, and now we, we, we compete with whatever we're into and you know, for us with surfing we came hyper competitive and especially me like from the time I was like maybe 16 or 17 total time, I was like my mid twenties. I was like super competitive where I want to rip people's heads off my heat, like I would like visualize horrible, horrible things happening to them while I was competing against them and it's so crazy how that's gone. One hundred percent gone from my. My being now, I can't even imagine doing that. I'm like the most relaxed, non competitive person. I have no competitiveness left in my body. Well, I've only known you for what, four years or something like that in those years I could not imagine you have an evil thoughts towards someone who seem so chill. I was a shit talker. Or are you really? Yeah, I, I,

Speaker 2:          00:08:56       I remember I was surfing as this Guy Damien hardman and, and he was like an Australian world champion. He was like an older generation. We were from the young new school generation were coming up and there's these established guys who didn't want it, but you know, like bd thrown in. There was this Guy Damien hardman who is a bad ass competitive surfer, but he was a very like tactician conservative. You'd never fall. He seemed like a nerd in me. You know what I mean? I was like raw kid from Hawaii and this guy was like so presentable and professional and I just presented it and I was in a heat with him and he got priority, which means that he had first right of wave and I just needed a tiny little score to win and he basically sat on me, which means he uses it. He used his priority to chase me around the lineup and sit on me and keep me from cutting a wave and let the time run out.

Speaker 2:          00:09:45       And the whole time I was like, you surf like a girl? He served for like a little bitch. Like I was like totally shit talking to him. And did it work? Did he get you? He got me because he wrote the I, I, I, I basically cracked and started like getting emotional and he loved it. He went, I got this guy beat. He started to shit talk me. He loved that. I any, any, uh, he actually came up to me later and he goes, I love it that you're that passionate. I love it that you got that site. And that emotional where you just started, like trying to like insult me. He's like, that's my goal when I'm in heats with people is to get them to that point. You know? It must like, that's good. There's got to be a lot of parallels. The fight world, right? Yeah.

Speaker 4:          00:10:26       Well it's also when, when you can get someone emotional than fighting in particular is so dangerous. And so when you lose, you're not just losing like someone's taking a piece of you, you know, because they're fucking you up. They're not. It's not just beating you on points. I mean there are beating on point sometimes, but they're punching you in the face to beat you on those points here, the kicking you in the body, they're fucking your legs up. There's, there's something about that that's so intensely emotional. So when you're fighting, you're fighting at your best. You have to be in this sort of flow state, this sort of Zen, not thinking about anything but what's happening and reacting and just going on your training and your instincts. And if you can get a guy to be angry and emotional, it will severely impair for most fighters, severely impair your ability to perform.

Speaker 4:          00:11:17       Most fighters, they lose to get tense. They tighten up, they look to wind up instead of just letting things flow. We're talking about this guy style bender who fought this weekend. That guy follows like when you watch him fight, he just flows. I mean he walks into the octagon dancing. Yeah, I mean like full on dancing like pop in and moving and has that mindset. He's just, he just gets loose and when he gets in there, he's switching stances and he's what? What? There was a mad shit talking session between these two guys for the last six weeks, but he stayed calm through the whole thing. And you could when the two

Speaker 3:          00:11:54       gun into the octagon, Derek Brunson just couldn't wait to just grab a hold of them and style bender just avoided all that shit. And one of Kale and I'm in the first round. But the emotional aspect of the shit talking and the, the, the tension that it brings because it tightens guys up. Like we were talking about bow hunting. Like you see a big elk, you have one shot at a big elk, one shot, you draw back your bow and you're like, Holy Shit. And it's literally a life or death moment. So there's all this tension. And if you could alleviate that tension, that pressure, you will, you would perform better. The mindset is everything. It's everything. It's everything. It's everything. It's everything with golf, it's everything with pool. It's everything with any, anytime there's something on the line. But what's fascinating is like for you, like you've watched thousands of fights like ringside, right?

Speaker 3:          00:12:42       Yeah, sure. So like you must be like, hey, we're in the second round and this guy is, you know, these two guys are like up and up. It's, you know, it's like a, it's like a super tight fight and you guys have a good fight and there must be an inflection points where you instantly know that one guy is going to lose. Like something happens with their psyche or something happens out there. You can see in their eyes, you can see it in their body language. All of a sudden they lose that, that edge, that mindset, and they are basically have already lost even though it's like right in the middle of the round. So then you see one guy that's like the. One of the crazy things about fighting is it's so unpredictable. Even when you think God is going to lose, sometimes they come back and win by knockout, like out of nowhere.

Speaker 3:          00:13:20       I just had a fight sport. Who are those? Yeah, the guy with an awesome instagram. Yeah. Black Dude. Dude. He was losing that fight. I'm not a fight nerd. No, he was getting fucked up. He was Lou. I'm like, dude, the guy's losing the fight. There's zero chance to win next year. No, he, yeah. That was so exciting. Volkov, the guy he beat had just beaten for overdoing who's a former heavyweight champion. Beat him by knockout. So, uh, Alexander's the real deal. I mean, he's a. He was what I thought was the dark horse in the heavyweight division, but he stood in front of Derek for too long and derrick hit him with a fucking bomb. He had heard them earlier too because derrick derrick hit him and knocked his mouthpiece out and he didn't know his mouthpiece was gone. The referee was trying to get into the Nazis.

Speaker 3:          00:14:03       He's like, no, that's not my mouthpiece. That's his mouthpiece, and the referee was like, motherfucker, you don't have a mouthpiece. I'm holding your mouthpiece, your mindset. He's in the zone. Dude. I don't think he was in the zone. I think he was in space. That's that mindset of either had been clipped, but fighting like the nature of fighting is built for competition. It's perfectly suited to competition. Surfing's not right surfing. I think surfing is like the least suited for competition. I don't see surfing as a sport whatsoever because when you're on the wave, you have to be zen. You have to go with the flow of the wave. You're not really competing against another person per se, even though you are. You're really riding the wave and you're being judged. Which is weird because it's artists, I humans. Yeah. But I think the, I think the single most important aspect of surfing that makes it not good for competition is you're dealing with mother nature.

Speaker 3:          00:14:54       It's completely unfair. Right? Right, right. Like, you might get an awesome wave. The next guy might get a shitty one. Yeah. Some kid who on a scale of one to 10, their ability levels like a three can beat the Kelly slater in a heat easily because it is just like if that kid gets the best waves in the heat and Kelly accidentally falls, he loses, you know, like that's just the way it is. Where like if I was playing, you know, Lebron James a thousand games in a row, I'm never going to win. Never gonna win. It's impossible. Um, but I mean surf competitions, cool that I, I've surfing it just as a lifestyle as like a way to stay sane and have peace in your life and meet friends. That's what surfing is about. Servings. Fucking awesome for that. Do you think you appreciate it more now that you're not competing?

Speaker 3:          00:15:40       Yeah, I do because I don't see it as, it's my, My, my surfing to me is tied to like only happiness and only like surfing with my son and his friends and surfing with my daughter and going to the beach and, and traveling to get epic waves. It's not about like pressure and points and a world title and sponsors putting pressure on me and my me putting pressure on myself that basically like the, the, the, the, the pressure part of surfing has gone, which is amazing, you know, I still put the pressure on myself to serve at a high level and perform at a high level to myself. Um, and, and you know, and be able to, you know, have having a game still for sure. I love that. I love the, I love the performance aspect of surfing, but the actual competition part is gone for me.

Speaker 3:          00:16:32       It's so cool though that you kept the love of it after the competition was gone because one of the things that happens to some, what definitely happens to fighters, they retire and they get fat. They don't want to work out anymore because the working out was so torturous and it felt so much like work that after it's over, whatever love they had for martial arts sort of goes out the window and they start putting on weight. They don't want to. They don't want to train anymore, but you even after the competition was over, you kept the love. Yeah. I just. Surfing is this unique thing. I don't know how you can fall out of love with surfing. Surfing, surfing. I. When I'm in the front of the moment, I stood on a surfboard and rubbed my first wave. I knew that was out. That was who I was in my DNA.

Speaker 3:          00:17:14       Wow. Like pure and simple. This is. This is why. This is who I am. First wave, my yoga teachers become obsessed with DNA, with the DNA. My Yoga teacher's been become obsessed with surfing all over instagram now is just surfing. She just surfs everyday and it's so weird not to nowhere and like 35 years old. She found surfing surfing's weird thing, but it takes takes. It's, it's A. There's not very many things that are, that are really similar to surfing in that way where you can fall in love with it being five years old or 80 years old. Well, I would think being a yoga teacher too, she's got incredible balance,

Speaker 2:          00:17:50       right? Like having balanced probably really help your ability to pick that up. You know, what's cool about surfing is it's, is it's a, you know, like if I, if I, uh, let's see if I, if I take 100 people and said all you guys are gonna learn how to drive a race car and you had like a six week course, just pure race car driving hundred. The 100 of those people are going to become really good at driving cars and going super fast and racing and they'll how this really accelerated learning curve and get pretty damn good at it. Snowboarding, Yoga, like almost anything surfing. I like, I know people who have been serving for three decades and they suck.

Speaker 2:          00:18:32       I'm serious. What is it? They've never gotten a tube like in the two. That's like the, that's like the Holy Grail of surfing, like writing inside the waves, like right in the center of it surfing's fricking hard, man. It's like, it has. It's like, um, I don't know. It's, it's uh, but it doesn't mean you have to be good to enjoy it. Surfing's awesome. No matter what level you're at. And that's the beauty of surfing. But surfing is hard to do, man. It's really hard to get good at. So that's why you get people with surfing, you know, five years and they're pretty good and there's people who sort of 50 years and they've never been good. But what is, what is it is a balance issue. Is it, um, ability to adjust your, your ability to correct while things are happening. Like what is it? I think a lot of is body awareness and, and, and is adapting to something that's changing all the time.

Speaker 2:          00:19:22       Like say it's like, you know, say for instance like basketball did know the hoops, they're the basketballs in your hands. It's the elements never changed. There's no variables really besides some dude tried to block it or, or golf. You've got the club, you got the ball, he got the whole, but with with surfing, you got your board and you got you, but that waves never the same. There's literally never want to waves, not the same to any others in the world, and so every single time you're adapting to things that are changing in the real, in real time, like up to the millisecond, the waves changing shape as you're writing insecure, so you're never like reacting to something that is going to stay put. You're like anticipating the wave changing shape and that's what you're going to like. I'm going to do a bottom turn into a big turn on aerial maneuver or whatever it is, but you're not reacting to something that's happening now.

Speaker 2:          00:20:10       You're reacting to the future. Does that make sense? Yeah, it does make sense. Now, if I was a guy who had been surfing for 30 years and I sucked and I was friends, we would still love it still. Yeah, surfing's awesome. You can be the biggest Kook in the world and have the most fun. That's why surfing's is that when someone who sucks, what's called a Kook? No, I'm a quick look. Who is someone who has, who has no awareness in the water, uh, that's really what a cookie is like, like if like, if I'm out there surfing and I'm sitting out there and I'm waiting for a wave and you paddle out and I've been waiting for a wave or a long time or some, some, some girl, 16

Speaker 3:          00:20:48       year old girls out there serving and she's been waiting for, you know, 15, 20 minutes and you paddle out and you paddle, right? Pastor. And the next way that comes in, you just turn around and go, you're a Kook. Okay. So that's, that's if you're unaware of the situation. Yeah. That's just, that's how people get in fights surfing, right? Which is common. Yeah. Um, well a lot of surfers are really into Jujitsu. Probably pretty dangerous to pick a fight with a surfer. Oh yeah. What does that. One guy's named Joel, uh, from Hawaii. From San Diego with the old tutor. Yes. He's a Brazilian jujitsu black belt. He is. Yeah. And you would never know it. He, yeah, he looks like so unassuming. He looks like a guy who fixes computers. He is, he's, and he's a Stoney Bologna. Super Skinny, hippie cruisy dude, like stony eyes, but he'll fuck you up.

Speaker 3:          00:21:38       He will fuck you up. But he's cool, man. He's, he's awesome. And he's an incredible surfer, incredible surfer. I've seen some footage of him surf, amazing style and stuff, but he's, he's, um, he's very unassuming. Joel, his Jujitsu is super legit too. Yeah, I've talked to people that have trained with him. He's super legit. He'll tell you a real quick. I would imagine that from that background, like surfing and that body awareness and the ability to adjust and change. That's one of the things about Jujitsu is like every role is different. Your, you have your rolling with different people, different size people and your ability to adjust and change is always changing. There's always movement. So he's exactly right. Adapt that weirdness of the movement. So Jujitsu and surfing or you know, they totally have their similarities because you're, you're sort of anticipating the guys next move, which is very similar to surfing on the wave, you know, reacting to what that guys going to do in the future.

Speaker 3:          00:22:30       Not to what happening. Right. That very second, right? A lot of times if I was a guy that had been surfing for 30 years and I sucked and I knew you, I'd be like, Hey Shane, Dorian, what the fuck am I doing wrong? How do I fix this? Yeah. I don't know. Is there fixing servings? Not like golf where you, where you need to get better all the time. Hmm. You know what I'm saying? Like, like, like if you can enjoy it even if you suck, is that what you mean? Like if you're a golfer and you and your [inaudible] I'm not a golfer, but if you're a golfer and your average game is like an 82, and I said, Joe, if you buy this putter for a thousand dollars, your average score will be an 80. You're going to buy that, that putter because it's the freaking world to you to shave two strokes off your game.

Speaker 3:          00:23:14       That's the biggest thing in the world to improve. No one gives a shit if they're slightly better at surfing is all you care about is like the is like waking up at the crack of dawn and having your coffee cruise down to the beach, seeing the waves and reading the tides and the wind and the and like going surfing with your buddies and having fun and then you go get breakfast and get some breakfast tacos and go to work. That's the lifestyle is like keeps people sane. That's why they do it. They don't do it to get better or surf super good at or go really fast and that stuff's fun. But I mean I don't have any more fun than a guy who serves. Have as good as me. We have the same run, but I bet he wishes he could surf as good as you.

Speaker 3:          00:23:54       Yeah, for sure. So, and I wish I served as good as the best stuff on earth, but it doesn't make it more fun, which is, that's, that's why I love surfing. That's so cool. That's fascinating. So what does it make it more? If you want to get better at it, if it doesn't make it more fun, what does it make it more? It does something. It doesn't make it more fun. Does it make it more satisfying if you're better at it, like when you surf at a high level, which is important to you, now it gives you more options because the waves get big. Right? Which makes it more fun. So it's really difficult to surf really big waves with, with really low ability. Right? So when the waves get big and really heavy and technical, you can't go out there and unless you have really good ability to level like in, unless you have a high ability level, you really can't perform in really great great conditions.

Speaker 3:          00:24:40       Right? So like when you see the crazy conditions were that you guys get towed out and you ride those 80 foot waves, that shit. No one who's goofy's doing that? There's some goofy guys doing that because you're using machines to tell you in the waves. Is that you? Jesus. Shane. Oh fuck. That just gives me such anxiety watching this. How big is that wave? Uh, I dunno. Probably Sixty feet on the face of start. Damn son. Oh, what does that feel like right there when it's over. This part's cool. Watch. I get air on the way down. Oh my God. See my board because completely an error right there.

Speaker 3:          00:25:19       Do you are so high. That is so high. Is so giant. It's like 40 feet above your head right now. Oh my God. This gives me anxiety. You know what's cool about surfing is in those moments, like there's very few things in the world other than like, I don't know. I don't know how to relate that, but I'm like, that moment right there for me was like the pinnacle of like who I am, what I do best. That moment, that wave coming in at that, at that minute in my life where I was in a right square foot of the ocean, when that wave came in, that was Beth. That was one of the best days in history at that of spot. Wow. Um, and I was there. I was prepared. I was healthy. Have the right board, the right equipment, the right energy level. I wasn't sick.

Speaker 3:          00:26:00       I didn't have any, you know, everything was just lined up and the waves are lined up and the swell was lined up and the wind was line up and the tide was lined up and I was in a perfect spot when that wave came in. Do you watch the video all the time? No, but every time I do, I remember all those things because it seems so much so, so much luck had to do with it. It's just like a line in the stars aligning. That almost seems like something I'd want to watch every day. Like, get, get the day going. You know, your first kiss from a girl. That's what that is. Wow. That like mind blown. Whoa, this is, this is like an important moment in my life and I need to like have this moment in time frozen. That's what that is right there. And so I think as an adult, you very rarely have those moments left. I mean, I

Speaker 2:          00:26:43       really like mind expanding mind exploding moments where you're like, Holy Shit, this is life 100 percent life right now, and that's, that's what I think we're all chasing. You know what I mean? Those people sitting in traffic outside right now driving on the freeway, they're not having those moments.

Speaker 4:          00:26:58       Not right then. That's a real problem. Yeah. That's a real problem with life is that people aren't having enough of those moments

Speaker 2:          00:27:04       and when you're a 75 yards away from that elc a few weeks ago and you had an hour to to really think about what you're doing and where you were in your life and how you know how you got to 75 yards away from this animal to the whole year of practicing on the target and all the millions of arrows you shot and all the preparation that isn't in this thing stands up and time's ticking and that moment is there for the taking and it's so easy to fuck up and it. It all happens the way that you. You hope to visualize it. Those moments don't happen very often, man.

Speaker 4:          00:27:39       No they don't, and that is what would a lot of people like yourself or myself or chasing, you're always chasing these, these above average moments, these high level moments, these moments where it just. Everything's elevated. Yeah, like when you're drawn back on a big elk, there's not another thing in your mind. There's nothing on your mind other than your shot execution and getting it done and everything's heightened and all this pressure around you. Some guys shake, like I've seen some guys drawn back on an animal and that their arms are shaking like they're shaking. Yeah. Like did you see it in everything? So much anticipation that could barely keep it together. I mean, that's what target panic is, right? It's like there's all this freak out. Just different. You know, there's, there's

Speaker 2:          00:28:25       a lot of different levels. Yeah. Well I've seen guys do that where they had a perfect shot opportunity, animal standing 20 yards away. Broadside exactly what you pray for and they get into the shakes and you have to let down, let down. Wow. Didn't even take a bad shot. They'd let down and just got. I can't do it. Just too much anxiety.

Speaker 4:          00:28:43       It's probably better than shooting. Oh, that's much better. Yeah, for sure. Smart. Yeah, that's, that's, that's an aware person. Yeah, it is. But I mean, I think human beings are meant to have a lot of those kinds of experiences. Those experiences make life richer and more satisfying. Yeah. You know what I mean? Sounds like two people who love animals like, oh, you piece of shit. You want to kill an animal that makes life better. It's not that like you're, you're eating meat no matter what. I feel better when I eat meat. I believe it's healthier. Have had these discussions with nutritionists and scientists and I just think it's better for you. I really do. And for me to get it that way is way better because I'm getting my meat along with this insane hobby that's super difficult to do. I mean I could go out and just shoot a bunch of pigs with a rifle and I could get my meat that way and it would still be fun.

Speaker 4:          00:29:35       It would still be thrilling. It would still be ethical. Wouldn't be the same though. Is it not the same experience? No. I mean, do you, do you, do you want 100 percent? Just for meat. You can get me to the store. Like the experience of that, of those moments out there with your friends and the under the pressure and, and, and, and just putting yourself in that position where you like, you need to make it count. That's right. That's part of our human existence. That's part of what makes life worth living is, is his habit. Having to, I don't even know, but just were like, you know, um,

Speaker 5:          00:30:12       I don't know,

Speaker 4:          00:30:14       but yeah, I know what you mean. You can get me to the store, but you can get wild elk at the store and you can't get it that way. There's just such a giant difference between your relationship with the meat that you're eating. When I take an elk steak out of the freezer and defrost it and I season it, your food looks amazing by the way. Like really, really good at it. Yeah. They are getting good at it. The week after you were in an elk camp and Utah, we were there with Chad Ward, a whiskey whiskey bent barbecue on instagram. Who's a master chef. He's a fucking wizard. He's a pitmaster winds like those world championships. And he taught me how to cook it properly. That was awesome. And you know, it's all about doing it slow and then searing it afterwards and you just maintain all the people threw that up.

Speaker 4:          00:31:00       Everybody. Yeah. Even one of the guides, one of the guides was talking to me about, you know, who said wild game is kind of tough. And we're like, well how are you cooking? It was like, well I'll just throw it on the grill. Like, okay, you can't do that. You can't just do it on high heat, high heat. Basically sear it and then serve it. This is not Sashimi, right? Well you can if you do it real thin, slice it crazy thin. Yeah. You can click. It's not bad, but it's way better if you do a low and slow. I've brought it down to 2:25 now I like to cook it at 2:25. Yeah, I just set it at 2:25 and I'll, I'll cook a, an elk steak for fucking an hour, you know, whatever. It's a trigger. Yeah. Because you. If you set a trigger to 25 users setting called super smoke and so just fills that, the inside of those things are so good for wild game.

Speaker 4:          00:31:50       It really fast it. Yeah, it's all just. The beautiful thing about them is the people don't know what we're talking about. A trigger is a pellet grill and these pellet grills like this tables made out of Oak, right? When they cut this table, they would take the sawdust from this table and they compress it and just using the natural sugars in the woods. They create these pellets and then these pellet grills, they have these, a worm drives that feed these pellets into a heating element and the heating element, it just, it just gets hot and then fire and then a fan blows in the fire to keep the fire going and it's all computer controlled so it calculates exact same temperature and it maintains that temperature. It's so good, but it's just so pure. It's just wood and fire. No Gas, no. No chemicals like on charcoal briquettes or no bullshit, so it tastes so good off the things.

Speaker 1:          00:32:41       Every time I. Every time I have people over at my house and I cook wild game on my trigger, I have these people like, what the hell I need to get one of these things. I've made lots of sold like a million of them right now. Once you learn how to cook with them and learn how to do it correctly, they have those little ones. Especially wild game. Wild game is really easy to screw up and it's really hard to screw it up on a trigger really because of the fact that it doesn't have much fat in it. Yeah, it doesn't dry it out. Doesn't cook out though. You know the moisture and the right. Do you take yours afterwards and set it in a cooler to let it rest? I don't do that. That's next level. Is it excellent. I'm getting gems here. Gold. This is from Dudley.

Speaker 1:          00:33:17       He does is. He'll sear it and then he'll cover it with aluminum foil and put it in a trigger or put it in a Yeti. Rather. Put it in a cooler clothes seal that cooler up for like 10 minutes. And what's in the cooler besides the meat? Nothing. There's no like a little like ice packard and like that'd be nice. You don't want to just let it sit. It's actually still cooking so I let it sit. I let it sit, but I don't, I don't wrap it up. And if you wrap it in aluminum foil and then let it sit inside the cooler, the cooler actually allows it to continue coaching just a little bit. Okay. So how many degrees do you take it out before? One 15. I like to take it out at 1:15. Then I see her the outside of it and then I seal it up with aluminum foil and then I put it in the Yeti and I let it sit in that Yeti for 10 minutes.

Speaker 1:          00:34:00       So it's continuing to slowly, slowly. Because if you take something warm and you put it in the Yeti, it'll keep it warm. Yeah. If you take something called it just insulate and incredibly fantastically insulated. And so it works with heat or with cold. All right. All right. All right. I'm going to try it. I talked to Doug, he's the wizard at this stuff, you know, I mean, and he's constantly cooking wild game. He essentially, that's all he does. A good cook. So very good cook. Yeah. Have you ever been to. It should be. She freaking does a lot of hunting. He better be doing a to cook and to. Yeah, he just drove all the way from Oklahoma to Kansas. He, he shot a deer in Kansas, drove from or not Kansas, Oklahoma. Shot a deer in Oklahoma, drove all through the night in Oklahoma and parked his truck and got into a, a blind in Iowa.

Speaker 1:          00:34:48       I mean, he just lives it and he's hard core. He's as hardcore as you get. Yeah, but that's all he eats. I mean he's, he's constantly eating deer and cooking deer and he loves cooking for other people are like large groups of friends and family and he's always cooking and entertaining. I, I, I love that about him. Like when he cooked for 10 of us. Yeah. That was awesome. Incredible meals and everything was well games. It's frigging awesome. That Lanai trip, man, I look forward to that every year. It's like a highlight of my year, you know, what are we doing it this year? I know, right? We got to talk with you. GotTa. You gotta talk dates. We've got to figure out the dates because that last year was so amazing to have everybody down there and you know, everybody is such a good crew. So fucking cool. You know, green tree and cam and. Yeah, it's just awesome. And then the first, first year we invented the cat lady drink. Yeah. That

Speaker 3:          00:35:38       one. Yeah. That was ridiculous. I think Dudley might be still drinking it. I don't think anybody else has died off. Red Bull and wine. And what was it? Tequila. That was the lab a little bit ambitious. So that was a fucking nasty because it definitely was a deadly concoction. Yeah, he was already hammered. He was just rated my mini bar. Just take whatever's in. There is like a mad scientist at liquors, isn't he? He's not afraid. That was such a fun podcast. So we're all just enjoy it. It's something about Lanai to where you can hunt in paradise and it's such a small island. It's like you'd use, there's not very many people there. The whole island, last 3000 humans and shitload a deer. It's crazy around every Bush scene it seems like sometimes. Yeah, that's a great thing is it's so easy to screw up hunting those access deer, especially with a bow that it's so neat to go and like find your Arrow and then you know, five minutes later you got a whole nother group of stock.

Speaker 3:          00:36:35       That's awesome. Well, it's also the most ethical form of hunting because they literally need to be hunted. They have to be. They don't have any predators. It's a. and it's not something that some person who was a greedy person said, oh, I'm going to put all these deer in the silent. Then I'm going to go hunt them. Now they were brought there for a gift for King Kamehameha in the 18 hundreds and it doesn't take a wildlife biologist to tell you that the numbers will get out of hand if you don't hunt them. Yeah. Like when you're there, it's really obvious. That's a perfect example of, of, of how somewhere needs to be managed. Yeah, and I know those guys on Maui have that project going on where they're hunting deer and then giving the meat to poor people, which is the best meat in the world.

Speaker 3:          00:37:15       I mean it's such an accident right here is so delicious and that's a great program. It's a fantastic program. What is the name of that? It's got some. That's a. that's Jake Muse and like a Hickey knew he project. Yeah, that's the name he knew he project. See you're from Hawaii. You can spit those words out my mouth. Yeah, it's funny. It's a. You should have jake on the show. He's, he's a, he's a really good dude and he's got some great stories and he's really well educated and knows this business really well. So he started meat company. Yeah. So he does eradication in Hawaii because it needs to be done and needs to be managed. So. And they're on Maui. Yeah. And so he, you know, he wanted to, you know, to be able to actually utilize that meat because he, you know, these big ranches and golf courses and stuff, they, they actually pay him to come in there and do it and so he actually flipped it and figured out a way to start a neat company.

Speaker 3:          00:38:06       So it's like a win win situation because the deer need to be managed and you know, he's feeding people and then the Kikino he projects totally different. Like he doesn't have a meat company for that, but he's able to harvest the animals in a really good way and then he's able to utilize that meet by giving it to families who need it. Simple as that. It's just phenomenal. And it's great. Again, it's meat that people would pay a shitload of money for. It would be like if, if, if you could buy commercially raised access dear, it would be one of the prized meets

Speaker 4:          00:38:36       because it's such an unusual flavor. It's extremely delicious. And people that don't like wild game and they were like, oh, I'm not really into Venice and I would like to cook access to care for them. I'd be like, just let me cook this for you and tell me what you think because I've cooked it for like, I cooked it from my mother in law and she, she was, she like took one bite of it and raise her eyebrows. And she goes, what is this? I'm like, it's access dear. She's like, what kind of direction? I hadn't showed her a picture of it. She says, if this is unbelievable, so delicious. It's cool to baffle somebody with wild game. Yeah, if you, if you can cook it right. Especially access drgs. That's incredible. And how beautiful they are. They just in general walking around and then we'd get one.

Speaker 4:          00:39:13       They're like, I don't know. It's just incredible animals. I think they're my favorite. The favorite to hunt? Yeah. Well what I like about them is we generally go on this access to your haunt like a couple of months for elk season. So you get all the jitters out of the way because they are, they are like seven times faster than you think. An animal that size can be like when they move you like how did you, how did it even do that? Like how does something move that fast? It's that didn't straighten matrix, straight matrix and the access to arrows. I'm probably going to Piss some people off by saying this, but the axis deer in Hawaii or different axis deer in Hawaii or different Benny O'bryan when we're on the NIH and he was hunting access to her, he had. It was very challenging, very, very challenging.

Speaker 4:          00:39:59       They were ducking arrows and matrices. Just he was having a hard time and he went back to. He went back home, back to Texas, back to the drawing board and said, I got. I got, I got to go hunting. He went and hunted access deer first morning, shot a huge buck and he called me. He goes, I shot a huge buck, and he goes, but I got to tell you, they're fucking different in Texas. Did the deer just don't react the same way? I mean, in, in Hawaii, Hawaiians, there's no season, they're, the Hawaiians are eating that meat 365 days a year. They're, they're hunting them with high powered rifles all year long. My Maui, Molokai, Ella and I, and uh, those deer are, they just react like crazy. Yeah. They're living in hell every day. The Paradise, but living in paradise, it's also a hell.

Speaker 4:          00:40:43       Every day they're getting shot at. There's, there's a good reason they're paranoid. Yeah. I mean, Dan said in Texas, they were just like head down feeding children. They had no idea. He was like, dude, it's like a different breed. But he was also there during the Rut to get a little bit more relaxed during the rough. Sure. They're switched on in Texas, but in, in, in Hawaii, they're hyper switched on. If anybody ever wanted to understand human biology, like male versus female biology, they should see deer and elk in the Rut. Yup. To see animals in the Rut that normally would be super spooky, afraid of everything jumping at every snap twig and they just walking right up to people like they don't know what's going on there in a horny for you get you ever see that video of the guy who taps the deer on the antlers with as well as Arrow? He's got an arrow and this deer in front of him. He just tapped on the antlers.

Speaker 3:          00:41:34       The deer is like, what? Yeah, well I think that would ever happen. It wasn't right in the meeting season once. Once they get those throbbing boners they don't know what the fuck's going on. Just wandering around. I saw an elk actually having sex this year. You ever seen that in real life? Up Close? Like not through binoculars. Yeah. So it was only like 30 yards and it's elk and they met. They get up in mount and then they go back one big thrust. Yeah. I was like, that's how they get down. Like that's crazy. That's crazy. It's literally like our double. Yes. And he was so proud of himself and he got down and he was just like, Shit. Yes. Got that moved on. There was like 20 other 20 other calories right there that he had the. He had the service. That's ridiculous. Just wandering around. Yeah, I saw it from about 60 yards out. It sounds crazy, right? It's, it's a fascinating experience to just to be around them when they're behaving like that. They're screaming and yelling at each other and, and running and mating. It's because it only happens once a year for those animals. Oh, we're gonna. See it right here on top.

Speaker 3:          00:42:44       It's very climactic. I would wonder how accurate it is. It's got to be here, man. I got to line it up. Yeah, I, he just didn't align in that up. I guess he's lining it up, but does he really know what he's doing? He only does it once every six months or once every 11 months. Let's be frustrating on. You can see why they'll fight each other for it. They run for about a month, right? Yeah. But how cool is it? How one bowl, if he's a bad ass. And a good fighter, he can have like the first bull that I actually arrowed with my bow, he had a Harem of 45 cows, one bowl and there was like three satellite bulls, but there was one bowl and he had 45 cows with him that he was hurting that were his girlfriends. And they're all basically in heat.

Speaker 3:          00:43:33       Yeah. So they're, they're like relying on him to service all of them. 40th five cows. And I, from what I hear, there's places where it's like there's like one bowl for 80 cows. It's crazy. It's a lot of work. It's a lot of work. It's too exhausting. You really want like three. That's like, that's like Dan Bilzerian, he's like a human bowl boil. Very similar isn't that is fucking logo. Did you have him on your show? Yeah, yeah. Yeah. So good. He's always invited me to parties and I'm like, listen man, I'm married. I can't go to your fucking pointless. Pointless to go to a party of his. If you're married. I think his, his logo was a bowl. Not a bull elk, but a bowl because it go. Is it a goat to go? Really? Yeah, I think so. So yeah, it does it go. It's like who's your move lawn, right? That's what it looks like. I moved onto the sheet, but yeah, that's a goat I think. Hmm. But uh, so is a super random

Speaker 1:          00:44:32       who's the best podcast you've ever had? Every time I think I have the best podcasts, we'll have another one that's better. I talked to someone that I respect recently and they said that the Elan Musk one was the best podcast ever. It's pretty damn good in history. Yeah. That one is wherever. The best podcasts in history. That's a strong word. Best podcasts ever been made. Well, he's such a unique mind mean he just. So they just, he just posted a video of one of the boring tunnels, first a completed tunnels. And so the. Let's see Jamie on. Yeah, it's an insanely long tunnel through La and they, they've been doing this only for a few months, but apparently in December they're going to start doing this. Like, look how long this is. This is inside La. I mean this is his actual completed real tunnel. That's underneath la right now.

Speaker 1:          00:45:24       Kay, can we talk about how there's no like, like a, like a prototype that we heard about is like all of a sudden he was just like, ah, how do you get a. Who owns the land underneath? That's a real good question. I don't think he understood what I was asking when I asked him that. I'm like, how do you, how do you do this? Like who do you ask to do this? Like all of a sudden he called my project manager. I'm like no shit house to make a well and they want to dig under their house to make a well and they'd go through the roof of your tunnel. Are they allowed to. I love that there's humans like him that are thinking on such a massive scale that are trying to fix the biggest problems that humans are facing. Guys like you were out there riding waves and I'm telling Dick Jokes.

Speaker 1:          00:46:06       This guy is digging holes under the earth. Yeah. I mean he's also sending cars in the space. Right? He sent his own car. He shot into space. He's got space x. he's talking about colonizing Mars, he's got a Tesla company that makes the best electric cars on the planet earth. I mean, he's got so many different things going on simultaneously. I just don't understand his capacity for work. He's trying, he's trying to fix the energy, you know, the energy problem with, you know, you know, getting energy from, from the sun to power your house to power your car to power cities and you know, it's crazy. He makes solar panels now that are actually tiles for your roof or your solar roof. Incredible. Like you replaced the tiles on your roof with these solar time. Solar's fricking cool dude. I just got it on my house.

Speaker 1:          00:46:59       I got, I got it on my house and it and have one of those tests, the powerwall two batteries and things insane. And it's got like this crazy smart algorithm that knows when a hurricane's coming to Hawaii and it'll like power up my, my battery deal 100 percent. Even if I'm not home, even if I'm not watching the weather channel, it just does it automatically because it knows it might need to back up my house. Wow, so my, all, my elk doesn't go bad in my freezer. So are you on the grid? Are you off the grid on the grid, but you have the solar power as well as a backup power comes from

Speaker 3:          00:47:30       the, the solar and you could sell some of it back to the grid. No, mind you that. No, they used to do that in Hawaii, but I think they stopped in the power companies weren't down with solar really. It's hard to establish solar. It's hard to get permits and everything to have your house set up. Like they, they try to make it kind of difficult for it. Try to make it very difficult. Yeah. But I, it's pretty cool. I've, I've offset my, my, my power needs with solar by like 80 percent. Wow, that's great. So you could conceivably just exists purely on solar. Yeah. Now you're on the big island. Yup. No wild is fucking crazy. Volcano Shit is going. How's that? You freaking out about that at all? Not freaking out. I was freaking out. Yeah. So, so I live on the west side in Kona.

Speaker 3:          00:48:15       The volcanoes on the east side. So is the east side, is that near? Just south of Hilo. Okay. And that's where the, the, that's where the volcano was, but the wind like the tradewinds blow east to west. So. So where I live, it looked like Shanghai for like three months. The air sucked like crazy. It was like La smog times 10. That freaked me out. I just pulled up vog bog vogue like. Yeah, like, like volcanic hayes. My daughter is severely allergic to that. Really? Yeah. We went to a store on the big island. We were staying at the four seasons and we left and went down to a store to get something for a cell phone. She came with me and she just starts sneezing and sniffling and her eyes were puffing up. I'm like, UK, like, what's going on? Are you sick? She's like, I don't know what's going on.

Speaker 3:          00:49:05       And the guy at the counter said, oh, it's probably the vog. And I said, what the fuck is the Vog is volcanic smog? And it just didn't bother me at all. But with her, she's allergic to cats and a couple other things like make her sniffle. It was bad for about three months where I live. It's horrible. Yeah, that's what it looks like. That's insane. That does look like it looks like Beijing, you know. And the crazy thing was, you know, like if the, if the, if the wind goes the wrong way, then like Maui Allahu, it's all foggy, like all throughout Hawaii. But it was basically like the whole, uh, the volcano essentially at a crazy eruption for about three and a half months. Yeah. And then not digit stopped. And the air quality is incredible. Where I live now. Real? Yeah. Just so blue off blue skies, crystal clear, like just insane.

Speaker 3:          00:49:56       Sunset sunrises. Uh, it's just beautiful. So what did geologists best air quality in 10 years for sure. Yeah. Why is that? I don't know because there was like a constant interruption for like 25 years, but it was just kind of small, but it was continuously going. But now it's like nearly shut down completely. So there's hardly any kind of anything going in the air. So the volcano blew its load. Did kinda like that elk? Yeah. Bang. It was. It was. It was lining us up for awhile and just big old bank. So the Vog is gone. So now it's probably a good time to go there. It's a very good time. Wow. Come over and visit. Does it fuck with the. That's why I texted you and said come over and hunt. We're going hunting. I ain't getting hit in the head by a giant chunk of lava.

Speaker 3:          00:50:43       Oh my God. Dude. Did you hear about the fricken boat that had a big like a lava rock, like a boulder lava boulder. And go through the roof of it. Yeah. There's like a spectator boat. Yeah. They were a tourist boat watching the volcano psycho there. They were so close. Yeah. Do you have a soda that Jamie that you can bring up? It's nuts. These tour boat companies, if they're. They're pretty opportunistic. You know, it's not, it's not easy to make a living on the big island. And so you get these people that all want to go see the eruption. That all the lava going into the water. Oh, if you can look for a photo of the boat near the eruption, there's some images of these boats that were like, it looked like they were like 50 feet away from this mega eruption. Like crazy. Really scary stuff. But you don't have to mess with lava man. Yeah, and especially when it's spitting things out as the year before that watches molten rock, the earth pissed. That's when it happened to veer off the coast of Hawaii's big island. Monday. Well back then a buyer. I want to watch it fly through the air and hit them and I will think what would I do? Look at it flying into the air.

Speaker 3:          00:51:54       The time to think about what you would do is before you get on the boat. Yeah. Once you're in that boat, you're. You're just locked in. Dude. That's crazy. The whole on the fucking boat roof, you see the redness and the whole of the boat. Just the hot shit just tore right through the roof. Well, and all, all of these tour boat guys are competing right there. They're like jockeying for position to get the closest, unobstructed view so everyone can take videos and posted on their instagram. Wow, but you're 23 people injured. Okay. Let's talk about if one of those like little like lava nuggets. Just having a flight to you just blow right through you. Yeah. What if it hit someone in the head? How about the guy next to you? It's headless and you're sitting there with your fucking camera out trying to get a selfie for instagram, but the thing is that everybody trips out and like, oh my God, is this unprecedented?

Speaker 3:          00:52:48       Is Lava just, can you believe this lava volcanoes happening? I'm like, are you kidding me? We live on an active volcano. That's where we live. I born and raised on this island erupting almost every day since I was born. True, right? Yeah. Yeah. Most of your life that is interrupting. Yup. Yeah. You can go almost anytime of the year, any year and see lava. Pretty cool. Kona, because terrence Mckenna used to live in Kona is is that you don't know who turns candidate. He's a very famous psychedelic, I guess you would call them a psychedelic speaker. Scholar. He's a, he was a botanist who I'm an ethnobotanist

Speaker 1:          00:53:26       who set up this place and Kona and uh, he was, uh, he was off the grid completely off the grid. Like he has Iowasca oh yeah. Camp, everything. He, he, he had his, I don't know what, what's going on with his old property, but I think some of it burnt down. There was a fire up there and I think he lost like, oh no, no, no. The fire was up in northern California. He had some of his books up in northern California, but he has a place up in the big island that there was like 30 different types of psychedelic plants growing on his, you know, and like 10 acres up there. That's a spot up there. And he had been in that house high as a kite or. Well, no, I'm friends with his brother. I would like to go there. He's dead now, unfortunately.

Speaker 1:          00:54:09       Really? Yeah. Yeah. It looks like a pretty frequent cosmic joint right there. Well, that's a weird picture, right? It looks very. See that picture? Yeah. He had a dope place so he would get all his water from the rain. He would. He had like these cisterns, I guess they would call them what do these containers that catch rainwater and he had a everything filtered that way and say horny hippies a, there's probably some freaky shit going on up there, late night activities of, but he was doing a lot of lectures on psychedelics and school, one of the most influential speakers ever on psychedelics because he was so interesting. Such an interesting guy to listen to. A lot of people like that really gravitate to the big island. Yeah. There's something about the big island where we live that has just. It's alive. It really is. The island is fricking alive.

Speaker 1:          00:54:57       It really is. Yeah, and you feel that there's like this, there's like an energy there and there's people who are like, I'm meant to live here. I had moved across the earth to live here because it's like just pulled me here, meet people like that all the time. Did your brick and he's one of those guys. I mean he's from Colorado. He was originally from Colorado, but I mean for him he was a bit of a recluse and he would fly six for six months of the year. He would fly and give these lectures in Austin and San Francisco and all over the world really, and then he would fly back and live on the big island to write books and the cool place to live. Man, it's awesome. I love living there and if you're a bow hunter, so in a bad place either. Right?

Speaker 1:          00:55:38       It's not a bad place either. Why isn't incredible for awning boss? This is incredible for people. Everybody's got a really good attitude there. It's like it's more, you know, I just got back from Manhattan, which I love a logo in New York City and. But every time I go there I'm like, I don't think I could do this. I don't think I could live here. It's just two stacked on top of things. And there was this one thing that I had seen there that I'd never seen before. They had like this rotating, rotating machine that you parked cars on. So say if you parked your car in here with lift up like this and then your car would go like up here and then underneath there and be like 30 cars underneath you. I was like, what the fuck is that? I see not in Tokyo. Crazy dude. That's. And You can rent one of those spots. One of those, one of those car spots for like

Speaker 3:          00:56:24       huge bucks in Tokyo. I'm sure like 50 grand a year will tougher like for, for like a parking spot at your building where you live. Have you been to Tokyo? Yeah. Lots. So condensed. Yeah. Yeah. It's such a strange. It's another Tokyo strange too because it's so polite. Yeah. I love Tokyo. It's like everyone's. It's almost like you're visiting an alien culture because I don't understand. I don't know what they're writing is. I see it but I recognize it as Japanese but I have no idea what it says. And then the people there, they're all like super polite and very orderly and then everything's electronic and it's almost like times square, like with big, like this is almost like a, like a parallel civilization. Like on another planet and how the hell they get there. That's where they ended up. Like if you look at the history of Japan, it's the opposite of that.

Speaker 3:          00:57:09       Right? Right. Means true old school, Japan. It's the opposite of that. Like all of a sudden they have like this full on, like forward technology, hyper futuristic civilization there now. Yeah. That's a fascinating thing about Asian period, right? Like Samsung in Korea, they make the, some of the best electronics in the world and you drive just outside the city and there's like rice fields everywhere and people weren't, you know, working with those cool hats on and like everyone has no shoes and just on their new mud. Then you drive right to the city and it's just like this giant electronic city. Yeah. Wonder what it is. Kind of cool. Good food though in Japan and all over Asia, but I love Japan. Dig It. No, Japan's pretty. I'm just fascinated by the culture period. I mean that's obviously the birthplace of a lot of martial arts.

Speaker 3:          00:57:54       Judo came from their karate. A lot of. Whoa. A lot of, a lot of. I'm not the exact thing you want to be spilling into the crack. I was afraid that we're going to have nothing to talk about that was going to be interesting or we get stuck on like our tree for like two hours. So I looked up a couple of things. What did you look up? I was looking. I was geeking out in the car. Was that impressive when I just pulled up in like a big Old Cadillac bug? A black cadillac with a driver or what? No, it's normal. Everybody does. That was really, really weird. Weird view because you live in Hawaii. Yeah. Yeah. Don't do that very often. But when you drive like a Tundra, some shit I do. I drive a Toyota Tundra from big on a Toyota. Every bloody in Hawaii has a Toyota kill break.

Speaker 3:          00:58:41       This fricken state car. It's the move, right? They don't break. They don't break. They don't. I've had three lexuses, Lexus Suv. Those fucking things never break down. They never have a single thing. Goldwater. Amazing. Nothing. No. They're incredible vehicles. Yeah. They just won't. And, and you know in, in Hawaii you're going off road so much that. Yeah, I, I, for surfing and hunting, I'm always going off road and campaign, taking my kids and stuff. So you want something reliable and you can fricking. You can buy a Toyota truck for like 35 grand in like six years later. You sell it for 32. Yeah. The resale values nuts and it'll go for 200,000

Speaker 1:          00:59:22       miles. They're great with zero problems and drive a big Tundra. That's the other thing that Japanese figured out how to do. Like how they figure out how to make things. So God damn reliable. Yeah. You know, is that you? There's my truck. Yes. Look at that. Lifted Toyota, Hawaii. That's my last truck. I got the exact same truck now though too. Good truck. Get anywhere you want to go. Yeah. I'm actually sponsored by the local dealership where I live. Oh really? Big Island. Toyota. Shout out, shout out to your Toyota. We'll get the fender flares and everything. I thing is google drive straight up a mountain or a bet it will. And up hold about 10 deer in the back of it. Have you ever seen that company called a Dev Rolo? They take those things. They make a bulletproof and they, they, uh, they spray the outside of.

Speaker 1:          01:00:07       Um, what, what does that fucking coding that makes some bulletproof? I might need to get that for all the Peta people. Do you get paid? People don't, you don't get any hunting and surfing. You would think that they're both. You're actually natural, but you'd get a little bit of it just because there's a lot of Granola crunchy people that get upset. There was a lot of like dolphin writers in the surf world that are like, you know, we're from that. It's peaceful from the earth. Why do you got to kill the Shane? Why you got to kill the. Why'd you have to kill the animals? Man, let him let him live. I always get these guys. Let them live. Always, always, always, always. They understand that if you don't kill them, there's going to be way more problems for them. If you don't, not only do they not understand it, but they're never going to understand it.

Speaker 1:          01:00:51       No, that's it. I used to consider like trying to explain that to people, but there's, there's, there's really not because what is, there's a coating that they, it's called Polyuria is the, um, is the type of material. But uh, there's a, there's an actual name for it. Uh, Adam green trees got a really, really bad ass Toyota. Yeah. Well he had his built his whole back area where the cabin is, is all like stuff. He's not just looks though he doesn't have like red wheels. He's got like real shit, like frigerators in there and enter fricking shower to shower off all the mud and we actually drove to his property and he was so mudded out that it was impossible to get up the road because it's pure mudslide. And he uses winch to winch us up up his road, like all the way up his road with the winch.

Speaker 1:          01:01:44       So. Cool. So it's just, I mean the thing is like bad. It's actually good for something. You know, he's been in America now for like a month and a half, just hunting. He's been almost getting killed in a tree stand last couple of days. Hell yeah. So he's texting to get the hell out of that tree. If you go to Adam Green trees, a instagram page, there's a video of it where he's in a tree stand. He's waiting like he's trying to hunt deer and he's waiting for a deer to walk by and he hears guns go off and then he hears the leaves crack because bullets are whizzing by his head and hitting the leaves and they literally. And there's video of it and he's like, well, what? Fuck mate. Because he's fucking as. Yeah. He said there was 200, 200 gunshots in six hours. Oh yeah. Where's he? Kansas?

Speaker 1:          01:02:28       Kentucky, Kentucky, Kentucky. Not a lot of Tundras. And have you ever been to the Midwest during opening day? If you drove a Tundra in Kentucky, it would need to be bulletproof. They would shoot at it. Yeah. It'd be like fricking Chevrolet man. They have a lot of toyotas down there. Do they? Yeah. They given not only that Toyota is Toyota trucks are actually made in America. Believe they are. Yeah. Am I Tundra was made in Texas. Yeah, there you go. There there's a lot of toyotas are made in America, you know, uh, the Acura Nsx, which is a Honda that's actually made in Ohio. They construct, they designed it and constructed in Kentucky. There you go. Holla at your boards. So they employ people. They deal with people. That used to be an issue in Detroit. If you're in Detroit, you were driving a non American car, they'd shoot at it.

Speaker 1:          01:03:14       But now, I mean, so many car companies moved out of Detroit selling cars. They kind of gave up on that line X. is that the coding? Yes. Next. Thank you. That shit. You could take a line. Exit is crazy. That black coating, that plastic coating that they put on those trucks, you can take line and cover a watermelon with it and drop it off of a building. Bouncing around. Yeah. That's. So they take that, that, that matte gray, matte black sort of cover that they look sick. That is a line x. and so these line x covered trucks, they make them and they also make them with Kevlar windows and door panels and bulletproof plates underneath them. They make like a. I feel like just a total piece of shit and everybody wants to kill you. You get one of those things just drive around a lie.

Speaker 1:          01:03:59       Next armored vehicle. How much of an idiot do you look like driving that thing around? Pretty bad ass. Just were mirrored. Sunglasses tell to fuck themselves. I like the like, I love the fricking Lynox the whole thing. That's like I'm watching the watermelon. Watch this. Look at this. Boom. That's a watermelon bro. Yeah. I was thinking look at this. Bullying. Well almost like a basketball. Yeah. So any scratches that you would ordinarily get from like branches and shit. Like I bet you're the kind of travel it. Look at this. It is doing that to my truck. Do you get scratched up? Oh yeah. Yeah. There you go. Just like that. You can just like pressure wash it. You have to worry about decals coming off. You have to worry about anything. You just shoot the shit down. And it's clean. Yeah. One of our guides in had his truck was lynette. It was green. Completely. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That's great. That was Alex. it's good stuff. Yeah. Alex love him. Yeah. That stuff just doesn't scratch too. You can go so many key your car and it just fucks up their key. It's pretty impressive stuff. Bunnies that we. When you, when you see trucks like mine here in La, it funnier one. Oh, there's a lot of them look like bad asses. This one looked like a killer and a lifted truck. You can't park in any structure. You just true. You can underneath

Speaker 3:          01:05:18       like any underground parking attendant. You look cool. That's important out here. You look cool. And like gridlock traffic at like 5:00 PM. Four. Oh five. Yeah. But you're above her buddy. You got to look down on losers. I got my lifted monster truck. Is it a strange thing when you come from your place? I mean, what is the big one and have 100,000 people or something like that. And the entire island. It's the biggest island. All of Hawaiian. Yeah. And you know, you go from there to here where there's 100,000 people, you know, go to West hills right here. There's probably 100,000 people for every, like three blocks. It is weird coming here. I spent a lot of my life in California actually, even though I was born and raised on the big island and every time I get off the plane I just so baffling that freaking lax airport and getting on the fricking shuttle for the rental car and then getting a rental car and then getting on the four.

Speaker 3:          01:06:08       Oh five. And everyone's going 90. Yeah, it's crazy. There's always an adjustment period of like a half an hour. So when I'm driving I'm like in the slow lane, like why this is really happening 80 miles an hour and then cost flyby going 80 miles an hour and everyone's going 80 and no one's getting stopped. And I don't know, it's just a shock. Well, you're used to place where people don't even pass people in the highway. Yeah. Lived on those roads. If someone passes people in those little single lane roads, people get mad, right? Yeah, yeah. We get mad, they get mad if you're going too fast, like slow down. Yeah. Well the same, the mainland. That's, that's, that's whole Hawaii is Hawaii. Like I think, I think we were talking about this on the, on the last, last time I was here, but Hawaii is just a, it's a different kind of place where yeah, you don't, you don't pass people just because they're going a little bit slower on the, on the highway and if you do, you better make sure they're not the wrong person.

Speaker 3:          01:07:01       They're gonna fuck you up. Yeah. You to, you want to show respect to the people and, and uh, I, I, you know, I think there's like a, there's like this dynamic in Hawaii where, you know, I mean everyone who moves there is, that's fine. I don't think anyone gets mad at that, but you just don't want those people to move to Hawaii because they love Hawaii and then try to turn it into California, respect their culture, the way people act and then respect the, the vibe that everything is more relaxed. But that's why it's so cool to visit. Yeah. Because you, you literally feel relaxed when you get there because everything's relaxed. It's a different. It's a different vibe. People forget that though. People move to Hawaii for that and then they moved to. Didn't want to turn it into California. Does that happen? Do you want to buy a big house on the beach and put a big wall around it and keep everyone out of the private beach and had like their own little zone and this is, this is my zone and my stuff and my giant house and you'd actually go on the beach is kind of her hilarious.

Speaker 3:          01:07:55       Holding like a chunk of beach. Like you don't own that bitch. Like you decided to put a giant. Don't try next to the ocean. Do they have security guards in Malibu? Yeah. Try to keep people off of public beaches. They say this is a private beach, like no, no, it's connected to the ocean. Motherfucker. Like your yard is the ocean. Yeah. Like my friend has kids. He has a

Speaker 4:          01:08:16       beach house and my friend has kids and the kids Surf and the kids were surfing just, you know, a few hundred yards from their house and they were in front of this guy's house. The guy comes out of the House fucking screaming at them saying, get the fuck Outta here. You're not supposed to be here. Like, nope. You can't tell people that just because you spend a lot of money on a house that's on the beach. It doesn't mean you own the beach. You don't. That's the beach. It's the whole Earth's beach. Like someone can come here from all around the world and walk on that beach. That's, that's your yard. You fucked up. You bought this $15 million dollar house that anybody could walk 30 feet from your house. Like that's just how it is, dude. Sorry. Isn't that weird that people don't get that they've finally gotten to super ultra rich category that the rules don't apply anymore?

Speaker 4:          01:09:03       Well, they're just trying that. I'm disgraced peaches, mind they're trying to scare people off of it, so they've hired a lot of security guards. See if you can find the article. How miserable of those people imagine being that person who's like yelling at kids because they're in front on the beach. Yeah. That guy is living in his own personal hell. I don't care how rich it is. It's just. It's just stupid. Like if you live on the beach, you have to kind of accept that your house is next to this public park. You're essentially living in a public park. Mean you have his dope view. You get to look at the ocean. What's. Yeah, but what's in front of your house is everybody's. It just is everybody's. You don't. You can't own it and it's never not going to be. And it moves. It goes, and that's one of the weird things that happened.

Speaker 4:          01:09:48       Apparently they did something in Santa Barbara. They did something to the, to the ocean. They did something like they put up some sort of a barrier, some sort of break in Santa Barbara and it affected broad beach in a crazy way, like it pushed the water way closer because one of the good things about broad beach, these I think they call a billionaire beach, was that these people, these crazy fucking houses, they had this long stretch of sand before the water and then the water came way up to almost to where the houses are now. So it's all gone, but now the people that utilize the beach are literally right from these people's houses. So they're fucking freaking out crazy. We've seen. Is there any articles about. Yeah, so these people have hired security guards to kick people off and then people are getting together and these lawsuits against these people that own these houses.

Speaker 4:          01:10:37       So you can't keep us off the hatches and I never want to be those people dark. Can we establish that and I just, I just want to keep those people here. I just want to keep going. Surfing and bowling and how the wealthier laying claim to the cow, to California's coast complaints have been streaming about security guards, uh, hired by wealthy homeowner homeowners, removing people from public beaches. You can't, those security guards, they can't do anything. Like if they touched you, like be assault. Like you can't tell me I can't walk on the beach. You can't, you can't do anything. I was trying to read through this. The first case says that security guard went

Speaker 3:          01:11:13       and got a sheriff and the sheriff told them that they're going to get a ticket if they didn't cut off the beach.

Speaker 4:          01:11:18       The sheriffs are all scared because they'll, all those people won the influence of all these wealthy people. The wealthy people influenced the politicians. The sheriff's want to keep their jobs. I mean, the whole thing is just crazy. But the thing is now today this stuff is getting out and it's getting out on the Internet and it's getting out in these stories and articles that are on the Internet. Homeowners have employed several tactics to keep their beach front properties. Private. Recent example of a case in Malibu and vibe involved a property owner charging people $40 to walk on the beach and banning surfing. Unless the person was a resident or a friend of a resident.

Speaker 3:          01:11:55       What you can't. You can't just decide. That's crazy. That's like literally going up to a state park and saying, no one can go in here. It's too close to my house. Yeah, there's nothing right about that stuff and I don't get, I don't, I just hate that kind of right there. That mentality that gives me the gnarliest anxiety. I just don't want to be anywhere near those people. I just want to get a far far away from them and like live in the mountains in Hawaii or. I do

Speaker 4:          01:12:21       look at this. She had been on the beach with just a few minutes with a tall uniform security guard approached. He said he told Schwartz she was trespassing on private property and threatened her with a $1,500 fine and a court citation

Speaker 3:          01:12:34       if she didn't leave, she's an employee to have the uh, mission,

Speaker 4:          01:12:39       right? She said yeah, she's a commissioned employee. Was asked to do some reconnaissance falling stream of formal complaints. At that point I pulled out the maps that I had and said, you know, this is a public area. Swartz were called, but the guard disregarded her insistence after telling her she needed to provide legal proof that she had a right to be there. The guard left and returned 20 minutes later with two sheriff's deputies who slipped swiftly. Advisor Schwartz at the beach was not for public use. Then I got a bit unsettled. She remembers as brave as I like to think I am. I kind of started shaking a little bit and started to get a little nervous. Did you read it? That was, um,

Speaker 3:          01:13:16       if you go back up, Jamie, it'll say, whose house that was? I think it was David Geffen's daily that happened also near his house. Same. Deliberately restricted public access. That same thing happen with Mark Zuckerberg on quiet.

Speaker 4:          01:13:30       It's 2013. The Guardian reported how entertainment mogul David Geffen had deliberately restricted, deliberately restricted public access to the beach near his home and carbon beach. Yeah, that's another really. You can't do do

Speaker 3:          01:13:41       that. Yeah. Mark Zuckerberg did that. Alkali real. Yeah, he bought up this beautiful property on the north coast of Clive's. Incredible, beautiful place with incredible waves and not that many people live there and he bought this insane like thousands of acres right there when the most beautiful places on earth and then try to keep everybody out and like completely blocked all the access and all the Hawaiians, all the local people got extremely angry with him and if he just would have been. I mean he. He's going to be a resident, right? You wouldn't think this little island on coal eyes. People been living there. You can't just like storm in there by all the property up and block everyone out. How you got to deliver and I don't know, but is it like alumni sized or smaller? Malott more than. Yeah, a lot more. Yeah, probably be 40,000 or something like that.

Speaker 3:          01:14:25       Maybe 30,000, but you know, the people on choir really territorial and protective of where they live and they live in a really beautiful place and a lot of people who aren't from there. We have lots of money, want to live there, people, people inquire hypersensitive to that already. So you got like Mark Zuckerberg, you know, probably worth $80,000,000,000 or something. Come in there and buy up all the land and try and block everyone. It's not a good move. While he's probably a terrible move, but he's probably super insulated to people. Right? I mean everywhere that guy goes, he brings security guards with them or you'd have to. And he's probably like, he probably has almost no interaction with regular people you would think. So these young man so young, he's like 34 some shit. How old is he, Jamie?

Speaker 3:          01:15:14       What's your worth? $80. Billion. Imagine being in your thirties and worth $80,000,000,000. Still working. How about that? That's cool though. I love that about these guys. Like um, I wouldn't do it, but like Elon Musk and, and, and Zuckerberg, it's, it's cool. Those guys believe so much that they can actually make a difference, that they're still, that's the only reason that's keeping them where it's not the money. He paid $100, million dollars to purchase 700 acres of land. Wow. It's 34, 34. That's crazy. Straight up bowling ball and out. Woo As balling. There's a big difference in him and Nealon Musto. He's got a weird reputation of fucking over the people that he'd made made facebook with. I don't know if that's correct or not, but that movie, man, I sue the fuck out of those people made that movie. If that's not true, right in the movie, they kind of set it up like he stole the idea.

Speaker 3:          01:16:04       Well, he had to settle. He settled out of court. Paid a lot of millions to like the winklevoss brothers I think to, to uh, because they said it was their idea. Yeah. They made him look like a Dick in that movie though. They shared it. It's kind of heavy that that movie actually got made. You would think that they would have got paid off to not make it. Well, it's weird to make a movie about a person, even if they got accurate reports from other people. It's so weird to make a movie about a person who's still alive right now and put words in his mouth. Has a lot of it is speculation too, no matter what. For sure. Yeah. Off Light. It says that the settlement was $20, million in cash and $45 million in facebook stock price. They're worth billions. Yeah, he got off light. Yeah. If he did dick them over. But who knows if they're telling the truth version, there's always. There's always two sides to every story, but a movie about you. Like if somebody made a movie about you and you know, had you on the beach saying some shit you never really said like, Hey, I didn't say those words. You can't have me say those words with an actor's inflection and his decisions to make whatever creative he makes with

Speaker 1:          01:17:10       the way he talks. And Ninety nine percent of the people watching that movie aren't having this conversation with people. They just automatically think that Zuckerberg, that's what happened. Dick, he's a dick. He did that. He did those. That's the perception. It's like if you, uh, if like Jamie was like, hey, you know what, I just got fired by Joe. Fuck that guy. You know what? Joe's Joe. Joe Tried to touch me this one day when I was shooting the techno target target. He tried to touch me. Everyone had maybe believe Jamie, especially if he was like a really pretty girl. Yeah. Jamie can be a pretty girl if he shaves hair. It goes. I tried to stop it being God damn ad blocker. He did try to stop it being made according to this. Yeah. Shin. You would though would need to stop the movie, the social network for being made.

Speaker 1:          01:17:53       I was from those leaks on emails that came out in that hacking thing. Oh, of course he did, but I think he has a right to it honestly. Yeah. Here's the thing, pretty heavy that someone can make a movie about you without your consent and put words in your mouth. That would be the thing. It'd be one thing if you were convicted in a court of law for that stuff, but if, if this is just like, yeah, I swear this happened. See, here's the thing though, it's one thing if there's a documentary and the documentary, they're showing footage where Zuckerberg is doing certain things and saying certain things. It's a total different situation. If you decide to put words in that guy's mouth and you have fucking Justin timberlake plan in a movie. Who Played Him in the movie?

Speaker 1:          01:18:36       I think it was justin timberlake. Was it Justin Trudeau? Yeah, he's in it. Jesse Eisenberg. So you have a famous actor. The famous actor plays you in a movie and makes you out to be a con. That sucks. It's his choice. He sucks and then the director is like, make it a little more country. Can you do a little more contained? Like, okay, I'll go a little more of a dick. I'll be a little more removed here. We'll try a little more removed. This next take. Yeah. It's like you can't do that. You should. You should be able to sue the fuck out of those people because at the end of the day, it's one thing to tell a story. Hey, I worked with Zuckerberg. That guy was a dick. He stole my ideas. It's another thing to have someone play him in a movie and make up a bunch of words that he didn't really say or you don't know.

Speaker 1:          01:19:19       He really said, Oh, you don't have any proof that. He really said that's a fucking snitch range. Like I've always felt that way about historical movies. Like they make a movie about Abraham Lincoln. Like someone was saying, how the fuck did they do a movie? Abraham Lincoln, vampire killer, you know? See, that's too heavy. It was really ridiculous. Abraham Lincoln was killer. Was one of the dumbest movies ever take to make it east killing vampires. I think with an ax, think he killed them with an ax. It was really stupid, but I was saying, yeah, it's dumb, but is it any dumber than any other Abraham Lincoln movie? You have a bunch of movies about Abraham Lincoln where he's just hanging out with his kids and talk. You don't know what the fuck. He said, you don't know what kind of interaction he actually had with his wife. You weren't there.

Speaker 1:          01:20:01       How do you. How do you pitch that movie to a studio? You know what, guys? I got this concept, I got this concept. That's when you know you've got way too much money is when you're making movies about Abraham Lincoln and being a vampire killer. Yeah. Pull up. Pull up the trailer for Abraham Lincoln, vampire slayer. I was trying to remember if I remember correctly though. This came at a time to the guy that wrote the book that this movie was made from wrote pride and pride, pride and prejudice and zombies were. He rewrote pro, excuse me, pride and browse, but added a zombie like plot throughout it, so we had to say he mashed up the story. It was successful. So he did it again with like an amber, Abraham Lincoln, a biography, but added vampires to it. Is there demand and it went and the demand that is there enough people on earth that wants to watch shit movies? Seriously. I don't know, man. Time is precious. I want to watch something really good. Not really bad. I don't know, man. There's nobody walking into that movie like, this is going to be sick. You might be operating on a higher frequency than most. There's a lot of people out there that just want to be entertained but stupidity. He'll give me. Give me full screen on this stupid piece of shit. I watched this thing high as a kite to you watch this movie. Oh yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:21:22       Were you. Were you. Were you in that shack on the big island when you watch this? Tim Burton?

Speaker 5:          01:21:28       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:21:32       This, this trailer actually looks pretty fucking cool. See watching him tell Liam Neeson.

Speaker 5:          01:21:47       Look, it's fucking up all these vampires.

Speaker 1:          01:22:00       Wow. Abraham Lincoln, vampire hunter. He chopped down that tree with one swing duty. So bad ass. Very high percentage of people watching that movie. Where high. Yeah. Well see, I think I see things that are not good for my job. See, I will. Yeah. I will go. I will watch movies and television shows. I will watch things hoping. Hoping it's sucked bad enough to become a part of my. He didn't have to hope very hard to do. That. Doesn't make it in there. I watched this as where the whole thing. I was like, fuck. It looks like jokes like a, like a, like a, like a joke factory does. It looks like it should be a joke factory. It's not. Well, maybe someone better than me came out like two months before the. The Lincoln movie with Daniel Day Lewis, like rushed it out to. That guy is amazing.

Speaker 1:          01:22:52       By the way, Daniel Day Lewis. Holy Moly. But that was another movie that bothered me. I saw the Daniel Day. Lewis Lincoln movie was kind of dull to slow. Yeah, but it bothered me that we don't really know what the fuck this guy said. It's one thing like there will be blood, which was fucking amazing. Yeah, but those are fake people. Man. He looked good as Lincoln. Crazy. Crazy. How good they made them out. Remember gangs in New York when he was bob the butcher bill. Billy butcher. Yeah. He's phenomenal. He's great in everything. So good man. He's just one of those guys. It just becomes completely. There's one. There's a few people that a lot of people that are actors that are just Weirdos. They're just these really strange people that desperately want attention. They figured out a way to use their mental illness to, to navigate the waters of Hollywood.

Speaker 1:          01:23:37       In some strange way where their virtue signaling and and, and, and behaving exactly the way Hollywood wants them to behave to get themselves into these positions of fame, and then they become movie stars and they say a bunch of nonsense and these, you hear them interviewed you, like you're not even a person. Like, this is not a person. It's not a person talking. There's no sincerity, there's no reality to it. You just painfully aware of every word you're saying and how people going to perceive it. And you just know there's no Ouzo your guards never down. They're just Weirdos. And then there's people like Daniel Day Lewis who is just this savage. You just figures out how to become these real deal. Yeah. Yeah. I mean he fucking stays in character. That was great. Last the Mohicans. He's so good. He's fucking great and everything. You retired, you know, he does now.

Speaker 1:          01:24:26       Huh? Make shoes. Are you serious? Yeah, he is a cobbler. He makes shoes by hand. That's what he does. Wow. Yeah. He's a legend. I back, dude, are you kidding me? And he was so good. Hilda the butcher. Yeah, I would fly to wherever the fuck he is. You get a shoe made by him. Should do it. I should. I wonder if you make shoes for people probably just makes shoes for his friends would like, does he have a company? Like I know he makes shoes, but like what does he do at these God damn shoes? What's his lifestyle like? You know what I mean? After all that like, you know, I was saying like all those crazy moments I got human potential like you know, his human potential of his, like acting craft like during like last Mohicans and, and uh, gangs in New York and stuff like going from that like extreme, those extreme highs and yeah, know performance levels to making shoes.

Speaker 1:          01:25:16       That's crazy. Usually people go up not, not, you know, up in intensity, not down intensity. Right, right. Yeah. The intensity aspect of it is really interesting. But I think for him, like he's, he's such an artist that I don't think he cares whether or not people are looking at his art. I think he cares about the process of creating. So I think the same to him. Yeah, I think the process, well maybe even more pure because of the fact that it doesn't have any adulation. There's no. There's no spotlight on it. There's no publicity team. There's no stupid interviews he asked to do. You know what I mean? I'm like, yeah, that stuff must be maddening for him to sit down with someone from fucking e entertainment television. So mad. You got another dope movie coming out. Tell us about. It sounds like you need a Daniel Day Lewis on the podcast here. He'd

Speaker 3:          01:26:04       be freaking amazing, but maybe he would have. Cool. That'd be to talk about shoes. You probably be cycling on that. Maybe I will talk to that guy for three hours just about shoes. If he was into. Just tell me about your stitching process. Like what do you choose your leather? I don't think, from what I just read, I don't think that he does it. It says that he took time off from making movies to study under this very well known shoemaker for 10 months specifically and only did thou. Then he came back though. He made a movie like last year called the phantom thread, which were, he was a designer, a fashion designer, and then he learned to, uh, in order to do that he reverse engineered a Valencia, Aka dress and to just to learn how to become a fashion Jaga dressed. You know what, that we, we pulled up at the blend stock as a company.

Speaker 3:          01:26:47       It's that they make that shirt we made, we put up a few weeks ago, he doubles shirt thing. So it's a high end, very high end stuff. Um, so yeah, and then put it back together again so he could understand the process of doing it. That was like his for us, how he became it, got into character for the, for that movie. So I don't know if he's retired all the way. It doesn't seem like he makes a believer he retired and when he made that movie last year though, since 2017 for a while, he likes six. There's only one way to find out. He did retire. It took some time off as Daniel. If you're out there anytime to just Holler at me. I don't know. I know you don't have a dog, but I know you don't have a twitter, but I got people. You got people.

Speaker 4:          01:27:27       He was amazing in the movie. The boxer two, in my opinion, he did. He played the most believable professional boxer in a film because a lot of films like even like the movie with Marky mark where he played, um, micky ward. It was like Mark Walberg knows how to punch. He knows how to throw punches, but there's a difference between throwing punches in a movie and a guy throwing punches in a fight. And if you look at the way Daniel Day Lewis is performing in that boxing movie, he looks like a guy who's throwing punches in a fight. It's way more realistic. Any boxing movie I've ever seen. And he boxed for a full year before we did that movie. You mean just lived in a boxing gym. He trained all the time, sparred, hit the pads. He got real coaching from. He played a guy who is an Ira guy who got out of jail and then got back into boxing and then there's a bunch of terrorists, shit involved in the film's very good movie, but see if you can find footage of him from that movie. So when, when you see boxing movies, guys are throwing punches like they know they're not going to get hit back. Like this is a certain thing about boxing. Like if you watch a guy actually fighting, there's a tension, there's a tension to worry about her getting hit back and you see a movie about a boxer goes like, hey man, it's just too much. The myths are down, their chins out. It's not just that. It's like the way they're moving. There's no anticipation. There's no offense. Right? Even when they're getting hit, it's bullshit. It's

Speaker 1:          01:29:02       like you can tell it makes it drives me crazy to watch him in here. I mean, this guy, he, he studied and trained, I forget who was training, um, but it was like legit professional boxers see crazy. That commitment that these guys do to take their acting to the next level because it's like there's not that many people who have noticed that he fights more like a real fighter. You know what I'm saying? No, there's not. But even like see like other ways throwing these punches like this is the way a real boxer throws punches. Like they're not wide. Everything's real tight. Pretty fucking impressive. But I mean I would expect nothing else from this guy. Yeah, he's legit. He's a madman. Yeah. Legit. But it'd be a real Weirdo to talk to. Yeah, I know. It's only one way to find out. Yeah. You want me to get them on? When are we going hunting? I Dunno. I think June you want to do may or June. Let's try to plan something. Yeah, for sure. The Nih does the next one. You should come with us to Dudley's place in Oklahoma and in March we're going to go pig hunting. That'd be fun. It's infested march

Speaker 1:          01:30:10       actually. The size of that gigantic pig that he shot down there. Yeah, I did monster 450 pound pig. Shit. It's like a tank, so it's as big as this table, these huge big pork chops. It's the three of us stack together form the form. It's so mark shake. Yeah. We're going to do it in March and it sounds like fun. Yeah. He has a giant place that he leases in Oklahoma and it's all. It's all just just beautiful, wild, open country. Oklahoma's very underrated. You ever been to Oklahoma? I've never been to the Midwest. Ohio tomorrow. Oh, you're going white tail hunt the first time ever. Is that the Midwest? Yes. See, I've never even know where the Midwest is. Hawaii.

Speaker 1:          01:30:55       Yeah. Know Ohio's shit. I'm a Midwest Virgin, so I'm going back to Ohio. That's actually where my mom is from, so. Oh, that's cool. What part of a why or what part of Ohio rather? I think the southern part. I'm going, I'm going to white tail hunting right now. I've got to go. And what part of Mrs? Right in the middle. So that's Portsmith Kentucky area. Maybe you're Cincinnati. I'm is my favorite spot. I'm hoping it's not too cold. Columbus, the Shit I'm a big fan of Cleveland to, but God Damn Columbus is a shit. Columbus is awesome. I'm excited to see it. Just for whatever font, what I. I'm guessing it's foreign lands flat, is that right? Not Flat. That's the misinterpretations. It's flatter than most areas for sure, but like especially down from Columbus down to the South area where the rivers go, there's a spa, there's Indian mounds and there's all sorts of a glacier cut out spaces.

Speaker 1:          01:31:45       Yeah, the hocking hills is a very cool spot and there's also this old man's cave is a really cool spot to. It's like a traditional. I think Columbus is one of the most underrated cities in the country. Yeah. Yeah. People don't think about it as it's like the people are fucking cool. It's a really good place to stand up for stand up comedy. So one of the best places in the world. It's just fucking phenomenal. They're smart, but they're also like midwest type people, but they uh, but they, they're not stuck up. Right. You know, it's like, it's like a, almost like Chicago. It's like a lot like Chicago. I think. Well, I'm not going to see it. I'm just gonna. Go straight to my tree stand. Yeah. Treestand hung. Have you ever done it before? I've done a little bit of trees down hunting, but it's a mind fuck.

Speaker 1:          01:32:27       I'm really bad at. I'm. I'm, I'm impatient. I like to be stocking. I like to be on the move. I like to be finding deer. I like to be, you know, I like that being. I like to hunt. I want to be the hunter and so for me, like sitting in a tree for four days straight, it will be interesting to see if I have what it takes. It's weird too because oddly aware that if you fail, you're fucked. Like you have to wear a harness and all that jazz. Like I did it with Dudley the first time I ever treat. I've hunted deer before on the ground in a ground blind, but the first time ever did it in a tree stand was at Dudley's place. That's where you gotta go. Dudley. Dudley has the craziest spot. I'm going to hit up. Dudley then Doug, he's got like 600 acres all bowhunting.

Speaker 1:          01:33:12       He lives in, he lives in. He literally lives in White Tail Paradigm. Wow. He lives in Iowa right in one of the best places in the world. For him to send me a text, send him a text. Have you down. You got to check it for an Iowa tag though. It's going to be cold this week. Cool as fuck. Son. Prepare for girl. Hi. Era Hawaiian. Yeah. Yeah. Does under armour have some good white tail close? They do, yeah. They sent. They sent me some really, really warm clothes for hunting. You might want to get one of those thermal fucking things. Have you seen the heated sleeping bags? Oh yeah. Those are dope. Dude. You could wear one of those up there. I could. Yeah. Yeah. They have those things. What are they called in inferno suits or something like that. What are those things called? See, the thing is I like.

Speaker 1:          01:33:58       I like hunting and cold weather. I love it. Super cold weather. Even if I can in my stocking around, I can walk around. You can move. It's not that cold, but if you. The whole point of sitting in a tree stand, you have to try and sit completely 100 percent still and move as little as possible and you're freezing your dick off. You don't have to. It doesn't even have to be that cold for you to freeze. Right? If you're trying not to move, yeah, it can be in the fifties and you'd be freezing your balls off. Right? Because you're not moving so your body's not generating heat. But I've hunted when it's like, you know, eight degrees or 10 degrees in eastern Colorado and I was okay because I could move. You know that you're taking layers off if you're going up hills. Right? Like that is one of the things that's really interesting to me about hunting and cold weather is the whole layering system is that you have to really be aware of when you're sweating. So the whole key is to get yourself to the point where you're never sweating so as your mood, because if you're sweating and then you have to cool off and then you have to sweat, it kills herself up. Your clothes are wet from

Speaker 4:          01:34:58       sweat, you're fucked. Yeah, you know, that's one of the beautiful things about wool is that will allow you to retain your body heat, even if it's wet, you know, he doesn't, doesn't really fuck with you the same way that a lot of synthetics and particularly cotton cotton's the worse. Yeah. Synthetics are good because they, it, they, they'll, they'll dry quickly. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Have you ever seen that rewarming drill that John Barklow from Sitka did where he jumps in a river with wet clothes and chose how to heat your body back up now. But I just did a hunt with a um, I just had a hunt with John Hart from Sitka. Yeah. Yeah. He's a great guy. He's a great guy. He was a lot of fun hunting with and we talked about survival stuff a bit like, you know, stuff like that. Like what do you do if you fall in a river and it's cold. That guy who attend me is like one of the, I mean because he owns the company. He's one of the best representations of what you would want from a guy who owns a big company, who was a ceo of a big company that's involved in hunting. Super Smart, really articulate conservation minded, very ethical, just solid, super solid. I was with him in Utah. Yeah. Great Guy. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          01:36:12       Awesome company too. I know you're a good stuff. Yeah. There's, there's, there's, you know, I mean, there's a lot of good stuff out there, but I just, uh, yeah. I'm, I'm, I'm hoping I stay warm on this, on his hunt in BC. Where were you guys were in Hawaii. Oh, that's right. That's right. I was thinking you were in that Moose hunt that they just come back from China. We're hunting in Hawaii. So you were in that crazy ranch. That's somewhere on the big island. The people never hunt, right? Um, some big area. Yeah, we were, we were hunting on the big island. Um, we're hunting pigs. It, I was, I was hunting in an area that was like, um, I explain it. We're, yeah, we're, we're hunting these big bars on the big island. And uh, it was a lot of fun. It was great.

Speaker 4:          01:36:54       But he's a, he's, he's a really good dude. Yeah. Did they have like numbers that they have to keep the pigs down to, do they have like a point where the pigs reach? Because for people who don't know, it really does have several litters a year and if they're not because there's no predators on Hawaii. So if the pigs aren't kept in check by people, they'll get completely out of hand. So do they have wildlife biologists who manage the numbers and try to decide like what to do? They just try and kill as many as again. So they just have people hunt constantly. Yeah. And is it not a problem because so many people hunt there? I mean it just sorta depends who you ask. It's, it's, it's crazy because like with the pigs, the pigs can thrive and really thick areas. So there is very difficult to do like a to figure out how many pigs there are.

Speaker 4:          01:37:41       Like if you try and count the number of deer on Maui, people count them. My friend Jake does it, he'll fly in the grid and they'll get a pretty darn accurate reading of how many deer on the island, but try and figure out how many pigs on the big island. It's impossible. They live in the jungle, right? Because they're all in underbrush. They. Yeah. But the deer, they come out in the open, you know, and you chased him with a, with a helicopter and you can see them. They're all running pigs. Don't do that. Just go right into the thick. So basically there's infinite numbers of pigs on the big island. So do they also have sheep? We have, we have moved on sheet. We have like a, like a hybrid sheep. We have um, we got goats and, and those you can, you can get numbers of and you can knock them down really quick if you're trying to eradicate them.

Speaker 4:          01:38:24       Pigs. It's really difficult. How did the move launch? Cheap taste move on. Cheaper. Amazing. Yeah, that's what I've heard. They're really fantastic. They're great to hunt. Did you see that controversy that happened pretty recently where a woman shot a shot, a wild sheep? I did one year up goat Europe in Europe and people were upset at her and all these Ricky Gervais', of course he has to jump in. That's his favorite thing. Glenn Greenwald, all these people jumped in. What would they don't understand is these wild goats are invasive species. They have no natural predators and they. They hunt them to preserve the wildlife. That's indicative, that's native to the area. Whether it's the plant life, animal life, I mean these, these goats, if their populations are left unchecked, they hunt them for a very specific reason, like really. Have you talked to some wildlife biologists? They should be eradicated because there are.

Speaker 4:          01:39:23       A lot of them were left on islands. People don't realize this by whalers the. They left them on these islands because this was an island off of a, I believe it was off of Ireland or Scotland. See if you can find that story. Scotland, a lot of them are left there by by travelers so that they would have food there when they came back, so they would drop these things off on these certain islands and in fact there was a real area, a real problem where they drop them off, so this was the woman and people got all over this lady for shooting this wild goat, which is really kind of crazy because they eat them, they're delicious. They either have his food, they're invasive. I mean there's so many things going in in toe pointing towards the direction that this was actually a smart conservation thing to do, but I guess maybe it was because of the way she talked about it.

Speaker 4:          01:40:15       No, because she said it was a really fun hunt or something like that, but like I get it, it's like a, it's like a beautiful creature and it would have still been alive if she wasn't there. So that perspective of people just like, you know why you got to kill it? It's, it's, it's a, it's a, it's, it's a wild animal. Living on an island, you can't just let them live. It's a natural perspective. It's as simple as that normal human nature to think that, but you know all the people who think that if you dig a little deeper, there's a lot more information there with those. You just can't let those go to get out of hand. There was hardy as hell. They don't die, but that's the problem with Greg.

Speaker 4:          01:40:51       I'm Ricky Gervais' or Glenn Greenwald, someone like that, that has a giant platform that loves animals and I appreciate that and that instantly post something like this, very inflammatory without looking into it deeper. They use their platform and they think to expose something they think is horrific, but they don't understand what's going on behind the scenes of this. There's a thing called Judas goats, and what they do is they'll take a goat and they'll noodle that goat and put a gps tag on it and send it out because goats always flock together in this goat will go near the other goats and then they fly over with helicopters and gun these goats down and this is just to keep goat populations in check so they kill every goal, but the Judas Goat and then the Judas go, we'll find other goats and then they fly over again and gone all the goats down and this is done by wildlife biologist, right by my house.

Speaker 4:          01:41:43       They do this just because those goats eat everything. I have a friend who lives in Topanga and they bought goats to clean their property. They thought, oh, this would be a good idea. We'll bring these goats in and they'll eat all the weeds and they'll know they eat everything. Everything. Every last thing they keep going and still they'll decimate local wildlife like whatever their their habitat is. They'll devastate all these local plants. I mean things that are supposed to be there that have been there forever. When these invasive species get there, they have a really hard time maintaining and then it gets to a point where they have to do something about it. Well, this, this woman paid to do that so that money goes towards conservation. She gets to eat the meat, you know, she has this enjoyable experience hunting these things in the mountains, but people don't want to look at that.

Speaker 4:          01:42:30       They just want to look at it. It shouldn't die, and it's really particularly crazy when it's a guy like Ricky Gervais' who eats meat. Yeah, so like the whole thing is just. It's so strange. It's just so strange that people refuse to look deeper into these things and they immediately have these knee jerk reactions where they want to complain about it and do so publicly in a way that gets all these people to attack this woman. Well, the photo of that dead animal, that's what. That's what initiates that, that response, emotional response. That gets smiling and then they'll go to the fridge and grab some steak and cook it and think nothing of it. Nothing at all of that meat is. They don't. They don't see the parallel there, they just think that it's completely different than weird that someone wants to go hunt them. Yeah, it's fucked up in this weird accepted, hypocritical way.

Speaker 4:          01:43:20       I mean it's, it's oddly accepted, but we all have freezers full of the best meat there is and eat it every night and it's amazing. I'm never going to stop. We do. Yeah. We that hunt. We do that. We actually have that connection with that meat. We killed it. We skinned it, we got the meat, we de-bone it. We packed it out. We packaged it and put it in our freezers ourselves. But this is the first step. Second. Awesome. It's the first ever seen someone get attacked at something that's immediate animal because a, I've seen people, maybe they don't know what's a meat animal, but I've seen people get attacked for obviously for anything like that it's appliance

Speaker 3:          01:43:52       and yeah, the Predator one is the biggest one I'll give you. Kill something that's a predator. People for whatever weird reason, freak out more than anything. Well, and if there's any, if there's like a, like a, like a, like a general idea that they're endangered. Right. You know what I mean? Like everybody thinks that lions are endangered or elephants are endangered or even bear bears are embarrassed or danger. Yeah. So, um, yeah, there's a lot of misconceptions out there for sure. But I don't really eat lions or elephants or. And like that idea. And there's millions of deer. Millions. Yeah. Literally. Yeah. I mean where we hunt in Lanai has 3000 people more. They estimate somewhere over 20,000 deer and they don't even know. I mean it's just an Nana's. I'm on a text thread with, with Benny O'Brian and Rennie and, and I'll and all you guys.

Speaker 3:          01:44:41       And there was a stat that they were saying yesterday, I don't know if you're on that text and they were saying that like in one of the Midwest states, I don't know which one it was. Do you remember in one of the Midwest states, like 850,000 deer die during gun season and half of them like 400,000 deer die in the first two days because. Because we were talking about Adam being in the tree. That's crazy. In one state alone, 850,000 deer die during gun season. So you think of how many deer that is. Imagine if no one hunted for like three years. What was that stat? How many deer there would be the number of car accidents nationwide with dear? I think it's a million and a half. I mean, but the people who get angry at the photos don't think of what it would be like if you just stopped hunting.

Speaker 3:          01:45:28       Yeah. No. How many goats Arab he imagined, dear nature would sort itself out. It wouldn't. Well, it would eventually be. You'd have to bring in wolves. If you're comfortable with wolves, eat and your kids. I mean that's what it is. Yours and all that big bad wolf shit from when we're little kids like little pig, little pig. Let me in. That's because wolves were everywhere and they were bad. It was dangerous. Like you would go through people's kids. That really did happen. Yeah. We just. We've got so far away from that. We forgot about it as a possibility, so now we think of them as dogs that are living their natural, that dogs just living his best life out in the woods. How other one, they howl, they're trying, they're trying to figure out how to eat you. They want to get through your house, which they're trying to figure out how to eat your kids and if you reintroduce them into yellow stone, they're never going to leave yellowstone.

Speaker 3:          01:46:17       You're going to stay there. They're going to stay right in this little pocket of where they like to live. They're never going to reproduce into like thousands. Yeah, there are those people think, but really they're going to just start roaming and. Yeah, and recreating thousands, thousands and thousands of walls that are all going to go into neighborhoods eventually when that's what's happening. That's what's happening in Montana. That's what's happening in Idaho. Yeah. I mean, these are all reintroduced wolves that are mean and they also go on the surplus kills or they'll kill like 15 elk and just leave them there and they just go nutty. Yeah, that's what they do.

Speaker 4:          01:46:50       My friend lives in Montana and he was telling me that the wolf population is so out of hand that the, that the elk population has been decimated. It was, it's down by like 80 percent or some crazy stat. Crazy though. Yeah. They weren't there in 1994. I mean that's when they reintroduced them right. In the nineties. So Yah, I mean there's, there's, I mean now that I mean now that human population is, is so established and a lot of these areas and you can't just reintroduce wolves with no plan to keep, keep a lid on it. Well, there is a plan, but the problem with the plan is the established numbers that they needed to achieve in before they start managing the population than there was immediate lawsuits by animal rights activists who don't want them to ever hunt wolves. Right. So in Montana they've opened up seasons.

Speaker 4:          01:47:37       They've opened up seasons in Idaho, they've opened up seasons for wolves and they would like to do the same for grizzly bears and all of these areas, and there's a lot of pushback on that too, but it's the same sort of thing, the established numbers that they needed to achieve in order to make it a sustainable population they've been reached and then the wildlife biologists, the ones are objective about are saying, hey, we need to keep these populations in check in order to keep the deer populations healthy and the Moose populations healthy because these bears and these wolves, they're just destroying these calves and they just run around and the populations of these animals go way down. Now there's also an argument and a really good one that you need predators, and this good argument is you don't ever want to be recreated in Montana, right?

Speaker 4:          01:48:18       Where there's just these deer and these elk. You want a certain natural balance, and so there's an argument that there should be a certain amount of wolves, and I agree with that argument. I agree too, but the balance can be really difficult to maintain. Yeah, that's. That's my point is like if there's too many elk and you want to control that number, say there's $100,000, but there should only be $50,000. That's, that's the perfect number. It's actually pretty easy to go from 100,000 and 50,000 to trial. That elk herd back pretty easy through through management and through hunting. Same with deer. You can pull that number back pretty quick. Wolves are fricking hard to kill, Dude. Yeah. You had to kill a wolf and you had a gun. Fricking hard real. If you had to kill a deer and you had a gun, not that hard.

Speaker 4:          01:49:02       You can find deer. Finding a wolf is freaking hard, dude. So once those. What my point is is once those wolf numbers get out of hand, trying to manage that population, the wolf population is very, very difficult. We'll places that are used to dealing with them. They know what the fuck to do. Like Alaska he had to them and everything and trap them. They fly around and planes and shoot them out of the, out of the air with helicopters. I mean they eradicate them. And then that Sarah Palin, I don't think she's doing that anymore, but there's a lot of people up there that do do that and you can buy wolf skin rugs that they, they, they sell those skins and turn them into rugs and do all sorts of different things with the pelts. Got To do something. Yeah, they do something with it.

Speaker 4:          01:49:42       So it's. But they do that because they have a vested interest in keeping the population of their game animals alive for a couple reasons. And there's criticism about that too, that they may be killed too many wolves because they don't. They want you to be able to go there. And a lot of their tourism dollars comes from people that fly in to hunt. Moose are flying to hunt deer and they want to make sure they keep certain populations of them there. So it's, it's all, there's a real problem when you get emotions and you have those emotions tied into this idea of wildlife biology and what an animal is, and keeping healthy numbers of these animals in a certain area that's a real, becomes a real issue, you know? And that's why when this goat thing happens and everybody freaks out over, it's like you should probably educate yourself as to what you're talking about before you start complaining because he just throwing gasoline on this fire and you don't necessarily understand all the circumstances involved.

Speaker 2:          01:50:37       Let's go there. Not only to because it, because they live where I live and they on, they love shorelines and they love like ridges and berms and stuff like that. And they're, they're, they're, they create so much erosion because they love those edges on, on cliffs and stuff. And so they, they ran all the berms that original. They, they ruin all the cliffs and then there's all this runoff and erosion and they, I mean they completely decimate all the grass, all the weeds, all the way down. They don't, they don't just trim things, they're not, they're not selective eaters. They'll just chow down all the way to the, to the roots and then eat the roots. Also, there's nothing holding that dirt in place. So when it rains, just everything spills downhill because of the goats. They really. I see, I see it. And with deer, you can see some, some impact that they have for sure as you let those numbers get out of hand, they have the same effect, but goats go through radical. They, the populations explode and, and if, if someone's not managing them, that you can see the impact that they have on the land

Speaker 4:          01:51:34       and that'll have an impact on all the native species to all the ground nesting birds, all the animals that use that, those, the grass and those different things for cover and for life. Yeah. It's a. and what they, the things that they feed off of all this stuff gets eaten by the goats, you know? Yeah.

Speaker 2:          01:51:51       If there's a large population of goat somewhere, you'll know it. Yeah. That was like almost nothing left.

Speaker 4:          01:51:57       Appreciate these people like Glenn Greenwald. I appreciate the sentiment behind it. Uh, really do. I just wish they would look into it a little bit deeper and you know, this woman's not bad person. She's just, that's how she gets her meat, you know? Yup. Like I said, especially a guy like ricky who I've met, I've, I've actually talked about hunting with him on a radio show before on the open anthony show. I had explained to him that I'm a hunter. I hunt animals and I eat them because he was talking about hunters and I and he was actually very friendly with me and we were cool about it. We had a good. He's like, as long as you eat it, that's what you're doing it for. I'm like, that's exactly what I do at four. But he eats me too. Which is so the whole. It's weird. It's the, the, the, the fact that people think like that they are morally disconnected from the act of killing an animal just because they use a credit card to buy is so hilarious.

Speaker 3:          01:52:46       But you hired a supermarket Hitman, that's what you did. Supermarket Hitman took a prisoner and a prisoner, you know, cow and fucking put a bolt through. It said. And you feel. You feel completely detached from it. Yup. No Karma. Well, and when someone needs a hamburger, they think nothing of eating a quarter of it or half a mil. I'm really full. He can just take that away from me. Yeah. You'd never do that with your elk do? No, no, I eat it all it all. Yeah. I'm making sure that if I cook it, I Cook enough so that me and my family eat it and whatever's leftover, uh, no. I'll eat in the morning or eat the next day for lunch. Huge difference is you have so much respect for that meet and for that animal because all the effort it took and you watch that thing live in the wild.

Speaker 3:          01:53:28       You have a completely different perspective of that meat then you do. If you just, you know, order a hamburger at that restaurant, you know? Yeah, for sure. Yeah. But that, again, that's one of those, I mean, you and I have developed this perspective from years of, of hunting and being around people hunt and we understand it for the average person that's never going to encounter that in their entire life. Now it's, we've developed this very weird society. We have insulated people from all of the ugly realities of eating meat and of wearing leather. I mean, we're sitting on leather chairs. Didn't think about it once. This used to be a fucking cow. Yeah, it's some a shot this cow and turns it into a nice chair. No one minds sitting on a cow that's dead, but no one wants to see that dead cow laying on the ground.

Speaker 3:          01:54:14       The eyes open and blood hanging from his ankles people, and I think it's important for people to see that. I mean, my kids have seen a lot of dead animals. It's not sad. It's a little sad, but it's not like they don't think of it as sad. They think of it as just like a part of life and that's what we eat. Yeah. Dad brings a deer home in a cooler. Dad brings a pig home in the front of the quad with his bow, with a buddy earl. It's totally normal. They see me drag it off the quad and shoot down with the hose and quarter it and debone it and, and they help me package it and grind immedion's totally normal to them it should be normal, but there's a connection between the death and what we're eating, which a lot of people just don't have. And I love that. That to my kids already have that. It's a good thing. I think. Well, I, I think that we have a real problem in this society where so many people, somewhere in the neighborhood of 95 to 97 percent of the people you meet and the number of people that have actually seen animal die. It's like, you know, two or three like what is the, what's the population of people that hunt in North America? Let's just guess, guess the prop population of the US that hunts. I'm going to say it's

Speaker 3:          01:55:22       three percent that, that might be high. Even three out of 100. What do you think it is? It's probably less than three for sure. Let's see what it is. What population of the United States of America hunts Jamie's raising his eyebrows, right? It might be it set on technicality here, but it says there's 100, one point 6 million

Speaker 1:          01:55:44       Americans that have participated 16 and older that uh, yeah. Fishing fish and wildlife shows that 100, $100. A lot of people behind you. But that must have painted. Yeah. Participated in wildlife related activities. Oh Wow. That's really, that's, that includes like pig fuck. That includes wildlife watching. Oh, wildlife watch it. And I typed in popular. That's definitely a lot of difference. That's a lot different. Um, does, that's all they came up. There's got to be a population of actual number of hunters. I mean this is back in.

Speaker 2:          01:56:15       That's the other thing too, is like there's a hierarchy, like people don't have a problem with people fishing. No, no, no problem. Or posting a photo with their fishing pole and catch. Yeah. Hey, you got some food. What's different between that present? Maybe that's what's the difference between now and a deer, but here's, there's a warm, here's the will. They're warm and they have for a movie made about them. Uh, they talk. What about Nemos fuck. Nimo. Nobody cares about finding nemo gets no love. He doesn't get any less. I was thinking of this though, like, you know, because I have kids and my kids eat meat. Right? And I feel like imagine if you made a law that after the age of 16 years old in America, if you want her to eat another hamburger, you had to kill two hours to two animals. Like, like you can go to a place like whatever it is, like a of a ranch where they processed me and there's a cow there and there's a rifle there and you go, okay, if you want to be a meat eater from now on, from their 60th birthday on, the only way to eat meat in the future is if you got to do it yourself at least twice.

Speaker 2:          01:57:15       Can't just do it once now. Kill a cow, watch, get processed, and then you got to, you got to wait like a month or whatever it is and go back and take another animal's life. And then you earn the right to eat meat the rest of your life. Imagine how many people wouldn't be able to do that. They're happy to eat meat, but there's that disconnection with the actual death part

Speaker 1:          01:57:34       problem with forcing people to do it. Just like got to have a problem with forcing people to think people should be forced to get rid of their garbage. It's just a wild concept that it is an interesting concept, but I think there's services like, like taking your garbage and bring it to the garbage dump. I don't think you should have to go to the garbage dump, go to the landfill and drop your garbage off. I'm, I'm happy that there's someone that gets paid to pick up the bins and dumped the garbage into the garbage truck and then drive it to the bit that I'm happy that that exists. I liked that. I liked the fact that someone takes care of your sewage. I agree. I like the fact that I can buy a steak

Speaker 2:          01:58:14       for sure. All I'm saying is like, yeah, if you could earn the right to eat steak, you know, say you have to do it every time. You wouldn't. You wouldn't have to like kill a cow every time you learn to eat more. It's like once you finish that cal, you need to kill another one. I'm just saying everyone should know what it's like to take an animal's life. No, I agree with you to eat meat. I agree. Everyone should probably know what it's like because. Because if you don't, it's hard to respect that animal enough. Like, like I was saying, like my, my, my kids don't. We don't

Speaker 3:          01:58:41       waste deer meat. Like if it's on their plate, they eat it. If they don't eat it, I put it in there, eat it next day or whatever it is. You know, there's, there's always a lesson to be to be taught when you're eating wild gained that you, that you've hunted yourself. I think. Well I think there's a problem whenever there's a disconnect, right? It's like, I think there's a problem with if money just comes for free, there's a problem with your meat. Just comes from a store, is it? There's a weird disconnect between the actual thing that's living and then eating it and most people, the vast majority of people are completely disconnected from that. Maybe that's all that's the case with farming vegetables to most people. I don't think they have an appreciation for vegetable being a life form. You're, you're consuming that, you know, there's a growth process.

Speaker 3:          01:59:27       It's a living thing. He pulled it out of the ground. You Cook it, you eat it. I mean, this disconnect I think is real too because there's a real good feeling that I get when I eat vegetables that have grown in my garden, you know? I mean, I love it. I really, I really enjoy it. I get a kick out of it and there's a lot of people who look down on us for hunting who are say like, you're a Vegan who just eats nothing but vegetables and fruit, whatever it is. And uh, you know, they're looking at us like we're crazy for, for, you know, the impact we have on the animals, killing them, whatever. But like a lot of the vegetables that people eat nowadays are grown in places that used to be rainforest, like the Amazon just getting whacked down just to grow corn, stuff like that.

Speaker 3:          02:00:07       You know what I mean? Like there's a lot of it is just cattle, right? Isn't that Amazon a lot of the deforestation. I think that the primary, a lot of ethanol to though isn't for, for corn, you know there's. But I think hardwoods, the chopped a lot of it down for hardwoods and they dropped a lot of it down to in order to provide grazing lands for cattle. They going the future. All of the vegetables and stuff we're going to be. I was talking to Kelly about this a lot. There's a lot of things that are happening now with technology that I think a lot of like the vegetables and stuff that we're going to eating or going to be grown vertically instead of on these massive farms have like these huge, like 100,000 Acre ranch is full of vegetables. It's all gonna be grown like in smaller spaces, you know, super, super efficient growing and smaller spaces to feed more people with less space.

Speaker 3:          02:00:56       I wonder if they could do be crazy. It's gonna be crazy. Yeah, that would be crazy. I mean there's probably some real benefits to that, but I wonder if they could do that with grain. We're going to have to do something with our population keeping growing and more people and more demand for food and less space to grow it. You know, there's gonna be an inflection point where somebody's going to have to do something. But I think technology is moving in that place where. And that's the thing. I, I, I fully get like the people who hate on me on say, social media, whatever on my instagram, if I post a photo of my, if I did post a photo of me getting an elk or whatever it was and all these people get uppity. But um, because a lot of people can't go hunting.

Speaker 3:          02:01:35       I don't live in a place where they can go hunting and get their own meat. They live in a city, live in New York City or Shanghai or Buenos Aires or whatever, and they did so unrelatable to them, you know? No, I understand that. I appreciate that. And you know, I think that social media is very strange in that regard too because people are always looking for people or things. You get pissed off out. Oh yeah. They don't get mad if I post pictures of cooking though. No, they don't. I mean a few. There's a few like proselytize very games. You're going to get cancer, man. There was one of the alleys do that. I think cancer comes from meat. He if all meet gabby cancer now fucking stupid. That is everyone would have cancer, like literally 95 percent of the population with cancer. So there's a few epidemiological studies that have fuck people's heads up because they've Kerr corresponded.

Speaker 3:          02:02:22       They're related. The idea of eating meat to poor health, but these people that have eaten meat, they don't just eat meat. They've eaten meat along with sugar and alcohol consumption. Cigarettes and lifestyle. They don't factor those things in there like a, like a, like a 30 ounce prime rib. Your body is impossible for your body to process that. Like more likely they're eating burgers with sugary bonds and processed meat and bullshit. When I eat meat, I normally meet the. That's like the size of my palm or a smaller, you know, eight wild game and it's that size. I think it's easy for my body to process that. Eating like a prime rib that's hanging off both sides of your plate, like Fred Flintstone. That's difficult I think for your body to process that. I just got it. That's not scientific. I just look at it and go, there's no way I can.

Speaker 3:          02:03:07       My body's going to deal with that. Where's it going to fit? It's going to stay in it for 30 years. You know? They always say that it's going to stay true to. That's all nonsense to. Wasn't Kelly's talking about like, are they shooting his butt out and stuff? He was talking about talk. Yeah, he was talking about um, when you go on these extreme fasts and then all this weird stuff that comes out of the inside of your gut comes out. Yeah, I would try that just to look at that stuff, see what this stuff looks like. Yeah. I would try it, but I wouldn't want to. I wouldn't want to look at it. I definitely would want like the, like the, you know, when like when you have a baby and they put up like a curtain sometime to see anything like that. Like, okay, I'm going to put my legs up.

Speaker 3:          02:03:47       Someone's got a visual of that, cut my legs up and somebody, someone out there doing all that stuff. You grow your own vegetables. I don't know. I travel half the time. I'm gone from home like literally half the time. So it's really difficult to. Is it hard getting good vegetables on the Big Island? Um, no there's not, it's, it's, it's actually really easy. It was really good farmer's markets. I'm lucky because my, my mom and her boyfriend have a really neat, like a hydroponic killer vegetable garden. Oh Wow. So like we'll trade, a lot of times I'll, I'll give them venison and I'll get really good ideas from them and stuff like that. That's great trade. That's cool. Yeah. So there's, there's a lot of meals that we do where like no one has touched that meal except for my family was. It's cool. I love Zan has a, she's got a macadamia farm

Speaker 4:          02:04:38       on the big island and she raves about it up there. Man, she loves it.

Speaker 2:          02:04:42       I listened to part of her podcast if you haven't finished it yet, but she's amazing. She's funny. She's,

Speaker 4:          02:04:47       you know what man? They fucked up. They really did fuck up. They fucked up when they blew it on. That lady is not racist. She's definitely mentally ill, but she's open about it. She's not racist and they, they just, they just jumped on the opportunity to virtue signal and to cry out against racism and to take a stand. But they took a stand against a woman that has mental problems, who's on all sorts of medication? Who they knew about it. I mean, she's been. She was put in a mental hospital for nine months when she was a kid and she's hit by a car. I mean she had a severe brain injury and ever since then she's had multiple personality disorder. She's been on a host of different medications and they knew about this. Everybody knew about this. They should have known that. It's basically like taking a person who's got a broken leg and getting mad that they limp.

Speaker 4:          02:05:36       It's what they did. Yeah. I mean they have a person who had brain problems who, who tweets a bunch of wacky shit. She's on Ambien and drinking and smoking pot and even then she wasn't being racist. She wasn't. She didn't know that lady was black. The lady didn't even look black. If you look at her, you look at a picture of her. She does not look black. She just thought she was being funny and she thought she was making a solid point that she was going to expand upon what you woke up in the morning as she literally said, that just all fucked up on Ambien and pot and drinking. I listened to as crazy. Yeah. That was fucked up. That happen to her and it sucks that or show got canceled. Well the new one sucks. The nuanced sucks. It's going down the toilet.

Speaker 2:          02:06:14       So. Hey, I'm sorta the same subject. Did you see the, that Rad documentary about the white woman who ran the Naacp and fricken act like a black lady? I know who she is, but Rachel Dolezal best, best frigging documentaries or as well as incredible documentary. Yeah, insane. She out of her mind, they kept asking her if she was black and she would just straight up like at first she said yes. And then she said like it's not that important. And then she was like tanning herself and like putting all this brown on herself and getting like weaves and doing her nails, like how she thought like black people would do their nails. Like it was super weird. And then she ran. She ran the NAACP. It was just a wild documentaries. That chick was just in outer space. It's hilarious that she ran the NAACP. Yeah, probably did a good job and she had a huge impact. She was like amazing at her job. Supposedly in the, in the documentary is saying that she got all this stuff done at that they were trying to do for a long time and she was really, really good at doing her job. It just sucked that she was actually a white lady who was acting the whole time. Well, what's really fucked oct

Speaker 4:          02:07:23       is Naacp stands for the National Association for the advancement of colored people. You cannot call African-american's colored people. That is a fucking slur. They have slur in

Speaker 1:          02:07:36       their title. We're leaving in weird times. Men can say people of Color, which is fucking bizarre. Yeah. You can't say colored people as well. You can say people of color. The same words just twisted around. Dude. I had a um, it's messed up. It's like you can just be like labeled a racist or sexist or whatever for like saying like, Oh yeah, yeah, that's wild. Um, I had a 23 and me DNA tests done and they're pretty good. Yeah. And I was hoping I was. If I was more than 10 percent black, I was going to start dropping bombs, but a one point six. So one point six, one point six percent African, pretty strong, it's all Dick. And uh, when, when they did that thing about Elizabeth Warren, I did find out what percentage. She is a Elizabeth Warren who claim to be native American and she did a test, she's like one, one, 100th of what I am like, it's literally like her saying she's, yeah, her saying she's a native American is literally like me saying I'm African American but I have more of a claim, have far more like more than I think some, some insane number, like a factor of more African in me and she has native American and I'm not even remotely native American.

Speaker 1:          02:09:04       Remotely African. Yeah. I'm one point six percent of one point six percent African in me and she has like some fucking really stupid number. What is the dump? It's like point zero zero. I don't even know how to make sense of all that stuff she had. That was what happened was a harvard researcher looked into it and gave a number that was very vague. That would be like one and 500, 12 to one and 1020 fourth, something like that. That sucks. It sucks. It sucks that that's the thing, like who gives a shit, but she got into Harvard because of this, which she claimed she was native American when she got in. That was claiming that she was a minor. Was Hartford, right? Correct. I'm being honest with that. Was it Cambridge? Whatever. The university. Shenandoah university by claiming that she was native American, so she got a special scholarship because of that. Literally like me going to Morehouse and saying, I'm African American, except I have a far better claim. You have a much higher percentage. Much higher.

Speaker 1:          02:10:16       That's so crazy. Wild. Meanwhile, she's so nuts like because trump was always calling her pocahontas and trump said that if, how, how is it that you can't. If you said the wrong thing on your podcast, people will be up in arms, but it's unreasonably president can say whatever the hell he wants to say. He's making tending to be a native American. He was joking about heart. She's not really native American, and he called her pocahontas and he said if she took a DNA test and showed that she was native American, he would donate a million dollars to a charity of your choice. So she, after this fucking test that basically showed she has these smallest measurable possibility. Native American in her was requiring him to pay. You should pay Harvard for the money back built from them were at school. Did she go to trying to find the actual thing it seems. I think she actually got a job at Harvard. Not.

Speaker 1:          02:11:16       Didn't go there for education. Oh, she got a job there because of trying to find out. Okay, we'll figure it out. But that's hilarious. The I. The idea that that is something you can lean on is so goddamn crazy. Listen, you're a white lady. I'm a white guy. Shut the fuck up. Okay. You're not. There's no. There's not a part of you that has been discriminated against because of the fact that you're native American. It just doesn't exist. It's not true. That's just so fascinating to me. People love to be a victim. They love to say, you know, it was my growing up was hard because I'm one, 150,000 native American. Crazy, crazy. And where does it stop? Like is it, is it, is it like, is it cool to say that if you're two percent or 10 percent or 50 percent, like where's it, where's it?

Speaker 1:          02:12:06       That's what I'm saying. At one point six percent, I really don't feel like I could drop right. 10, it's not 10 percent. Like I'm mostly Italian. I'm like three quarters of Italian so I can call someone a Guinea Guinea no problem, but two times don't give a fuck if you call them guineas like okay, like there's no really, there's no good slurs for Italians work, you know, they have successfully integrated into society. But when my grandfather used to tell me about, he came over here when he was a boy from Italy and he would tell me about how bad it was about how much they were discriminated against. It was, it was hard core. I mean they were treated a lot of the same way. Racist People Treat Mexicans today. An Irish, same thing. Same thing, yeah. Yeah, and that's my background is Italian and Irish. Mostly. Someone got fucked by a black person somewhere, somewhere.

Speaker 1:          02:12:59       One point six percent know how many generations. I guess the claim is that she used her claim that she's native American to get a job. Yes. Not. Not to get into school, get a job at Harvard, at one at Harvard, one at Pennsylvania. So she did it twice. Give that money back. But I love the DNA test though. I love the DNA test just proves it. We're all like something. We're all a bunch of shit. Like, you know what I mean? I'm like 30 things of whatever. You know what I mean? Like it does. Does it matter? Not really. Shouldn't matter. Well really we're all African. All of us. Because that was the original human being. It depends who you ask. I mean we came from our human beings evolved from Africa. If you believe in evolution, if you believe in evolution is where it gets a big f.
