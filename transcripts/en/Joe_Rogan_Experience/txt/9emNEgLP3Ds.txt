Speaker 1:          00:00:02       And we're live. You don't have headphones.

Speaker 2:          00:00:08       There you go.

Speaker 1:          00:00:10       Alex Niles Gray. Hello. How are you guys? Great job. I think you got to turn that sucker around and see that one. There you go. Nope. Oh my goodness. This is Joey Diaz. And when Joey Diaz couldn't figure out the headphones.

Speaker 2:          00:00:27       Welcome folks was going on. We are in the middle of building ncn. I've, I've heard the rumor, the thing that you got us kicked off on really the last time that we spoke to you. We were doing a kickstarter campaign to build Antionne and it was like three years ago and we're in the middle of another one because we started building it and we need a little more money to finish the interior. Now we've got a three story, 12,000 square foot building with a new roof and incredible spaces to exhibit visionary art. So it's, it's there and I guess it's just a matter of time, uh, about finishing it and more money weekend, the quicker we'll be able to finish it.

Speaker 1:          00:01:18       Are there images of it right now currently in, in construction that people can view? Oh look at that, Jim said, Whoa, that's amazing. Where did you get that? Looks like really old brick. That's cool. Looking brick 18. 80 two was built in. It said we were saving the carriage house from 1882. So explain the process. So it started out as a carriage house. Yup. And you save part of it? Yes, we surrounded it. Wow. Oh, so we surrounded it with art side. The building low. Jamie, scroll back up. Hold on. Don't go anywhere. Get back up to the top one that you. Yeah, look at that. Wow. That's just one room on the third floor. That's where the sake.

Speaker 2:          00:01:59       Okay. We're just going to be three floors. Yeah, we're going to put criss cross kind of scaffold a lattice across the angels. Um, let's see. On my instagram, I suppose there's a more recent feed of the interior now. We've gone a couple of the actual angels. They were 10 angels in the previous, um, chapel installation there in New York City. And I always wanted to,

Speaker 1:          00:02:29       he went to the wrong Alex Grey went to some way.

Speaker 2:          00:02:33       Yeah. Yeah, that's relevant, isn't it? It is. It as well. Let's see. So there's the space, there's one of the angels over there that's a uh, yeah, well this, this is the plan to corner one of the angels or the four corners that, uh, the direction of the building that we're kind of recycling the carriage house has the corners of the buildings pointing in the cardinal directions. So I thought that a feature of them there will be angels or the North South, east, west, and part of the whole thing is getting the four quadrants together on top of the building. There's a steeple head that is basically a four faced being that, that is the people, the four directions coming together. Envisionary oneness. So it's as a building, it's a big basically godhead. And

Speaker 1:          00:03:35       is that a real image of the actual outside of the building with the angel on it? No, that's that.

Speaker 2:          00:03:40       Yeah, that's the computer a model that was made by one of the Disney animators, Ryan toddle. He's a guy that is responsible for running the, uh, one of the digital animation teams that did Zootopia and frozen. And he's an amazing a modeler. Go back to that.

Speaker 1:          00:04:05       Look at this outside of this building that might be the coolest looking building on the planet earth. Go up a little,

Speaker 2:          00:04:10       but you'll see a, one of the coolest things about the video that, uh, is in there is that it shows that kind of spin around of the building itself that was done by these amazing nurse that's from the front. So you've got a kind of evolutionary thing going on on the side. Oh yeah. And then it gets to the, uh, the front door, which is Adam and eve, uh, creating a better world. So it kind of brings together those mythologies of those narratives of development.

Speaker 1:          00:04:49       Can you, can you zoom in on the Adam and eve? Jamie, is it a zoom as it is guys? Is that a caduceus in the middle of them? Not See,

Speaker 2:          00:04:56       actually down below a way down below. There's a, um, it, there you get to see. Oh Wow.

Speaker 1:          00:05:05       So you really did the caduceus and then sort of replicated the DNA, which a lot of people believe was what the caduceus was based on the first place, right? [inaudible]. It's all growing out of some mushrooms there at the base. Alex did the drawing and then it was sculpted in teak. Whoa. Full size four by eight foot doors. There's two of them. And then we had it scanned. We got a grant to have it scanned and then it'll be on the door in metal. So it will be cast in metal. The originals will be on view inside because they're made of teak friendships. So it's what kind of metals are going to be cast in bronze site. Wow. That is so cool. Yeah. And so what is going on with the evolution thing? So the evolution, there's the lower hominids they become

Speaker 2:          00:05:58       homo erectus. And then what does that child like thing with arms up in the air? Well, I wanted to add, thanks for noticing that. I'm on the end of this paint brush, which is kind of flying up and indicating a kind of upward trajectory. There's a drip coming off of it and that drip also act like an eyeball. The center of the eyeball is the earth. And uh, there's a skeleton, a child and the person who is fully ground woman and man on either side and they each are reaching for the planet. Now that question is, who's going to get the ball? Basically the skeleton or the human? Yeah, a will that, will we be handing this to the next generation or are we just going to blow it? So the skeleton sorta represents death yet represents the end of the line for the human species, for anybody is a. didn't even introduce your page. The instagram page is what does it. Was it Alex? Great. Column C O s m [inaudible]. This is a build [inaudible] dot com. This is the, I'm a kickstarter. Then how long has it been going on for now? I'd say about 20 days

Speaker 3:          00:07:20       were there. We have a 40 day campaign. We're about three times where we were less. We did this a campaign the same length, the same days, three years ago in 2013. And we're three times ahead of where we were. I wait, we, we actually, um, well we did 160 percent of our goal the last time. So we're, we're, you know, we're challenging ourselves to even higher.

Speaker 2:          00:07:45       What I meant was how long has it been under construction? How long it's been since September of Twenty 15. Okay. So you're, you're, so, you're an obit. Um, so what is the ultimate end date where you believe this all be constructed? Well, it really depends on the money that we raised to do the exterior. The interior we're going to have done by 2017 and we're aiming at the winter of 2017. It should be doable, you know, everybody's telling us

Speaker 3:          00:08:24       this is the interior will open the exhibition and then we'll see, you know, who knows. I mean there's, there's indications that, you know, like you don't know how much money's going to come in. This campaign is only to finish the exhibition interiorly and then uh, you know, if we still, which I think we will need to raise another at one point $5,000,000 to do the sculpture or exterior, which is done by a three d print out. It's a three d print out 20 feet high by eight by eight. And what is the substance? It's manner. Well, it'll be finished in a glass reinforced cast concrete, but you print out the foam, then you make the mold, you make a fiberglass mold. There's about a couple of dozen molds that will be needed to do the sculptures and there's a place right across the river from us. Thirty minutes away that does this. So that's convenient. Oh yeah. We were thinking coming to California, there are places that do it out here, but uh, we found a place so close and they're doing the Brooklyn Academy of Music and some of the big buildings in the city.

Speaker 4:          00:09:30       Has anybody done anything even remotely

Speaker 3:          00:09:32       like this? Well, you'll see theme parks where things are, but the glass reinforced cast concrete will make it enduring, you know, like it, it'll be if they don't knock it down with a wrecking ball, it'll be there in a thousand years. That's the building itself is a tomb. I mean, it's, it's, it's made to be a enduring.

Speaker 4:          00:09:56       That's our mission. So the mission is to have this thing survive you. The mission is to build an enduring sanctuary, visionary art, to uplift a global community. That's our actual mission. Do you guys have a caretaker when you pass? Have you already thought of like when you move on to the next dimension, who's going to take over this thing? It's a church

Speaker 3:          00:10:18       is that it became a church in 2008 and so the church churches generally a run by the it's board and the staff that works there, but you know, the board of directors are the people that owned the church. We actually lived there, but our house that we built there will be long to the church. Everything we're doing there will belong to them.

Speaker 4:          00:10:40       It's a 40 acre compound basically in the Hudson valley seed. Uh, that's, that's where it's happening. There's 21 people working there now. Wow. I trust you guys with a church. No, I don't trust a whole lot of people. I go, yeah, they're not gonna. They're not going to get crazy. But what I would worry about if I was establishing a church is not me. I would worry about what people are going to distort the message afterwards. Oh yeah. That's always the real issue. The real issue is whenever you have something that you're going to call a church or religion or have a sacred area where you take it very, very seriously, you're going to have at least one person who has an elevated profile. You know there's going to be one person or people who run this thing that other people are going to look at like they are different than us. They are elevated. They are the people that are in charge of this, and when people have that feeling that they feel like they're the elevated one guy, that gets tricky. That's so slippery. It's so hard for people to manage. Here's one of the ways that we try to avoid it because we never claimed to be enlightened ourselves. You know, we're aren't as well. I trust you. Yeah. Where

Speaker 2:          00:11:54       we're creative artists and like a lot of artists, we feel like when we're really doing our thing that there's a spiritual element of that, that your creativity and spirituality somehow seem like they're very strongly connected. There isn't any mythology about it. You know, if we're basically emanations of a cosmos that's creative than we're little embodiments of creative energy and that creative energy can be used for the positive or the negative in how you, and it comes from the way that you view the world, how you're going to take that. And so as an emanation of creative energy and artists is just a, you know, like an obvious symbol of that. And uh, so we see that throughout history that all the religions, whether they agreed or disagreed, all used creative expression to get their message out. And so it's one of the things that unites all the different wisdom traditions and unites a lot of other stuff that's out that would consider itself outside of religion as well.

Speaker 2:          00:13:11       I feel that creativity itself is the original kind of religious impulse that it's the way of knowing oneself, the way of knowing God. It's a, it's a means of worship. I mean, we look at the, the cave art and you say, you know, they weren't talking about sex or something or disagreeing necessarily as religious kind of ideas and things like that. They were making a mark of meaning and left behind something that was meaningful to their tribe and I think that that's still what we're trying to do and you know, I, I think religion because it scares the shit out of really intelligent people for good reason because it's such a mess in the world and created such a mess and so much divisiveness. Something that's supposed to be about love that's caused so much heartache and damage and so, and what I think is that when I told my friend Robert Jesse, I'm from the council on spiritual practices.

Speaker 2:          00:14:28       Well, I'm spiritual, but I'm not religious. You know, you saying, you know Alex, we can't let the fundamentalists own the word religion. Russians too important a word and what we need are courageous experiments in religion that could help us to get to the other side of the bell curve, the evolutionary edge. Is there an evolving edge for religion? Could we get posts secular in the world? Can we imagine a world where people have. Most of the people of the world have taken a sacrament of one kind or another and have realized that there's an infinite intelligence at the basis of the cosmos that they are a, you know, an expression of. And that ended life is a divine, um, display spectacle, you know, that, that God's gone to a lot of trouble to create. And, uh, so, you know, from the perspective of today what you know, because toynbee when he was writing about civilizations, talked about, you know, every civilization needs a spiritual core. And as it planetary civilization, you can't have one religion dominate. It's impossible. It's just not. No, it's not possible. And so how do you unite a world spiritually?

Speaker 2:          00:16:13       Well, my candidate is create the creative arts, you know, that all of world cultures have some means of creative expression. We get to know that culture through their music, through their know painting, sculpture, various kinds of things. And that how we, uh, get to know each other and see our connections, you know, and so as a potential, you know, something that's been used by all world religions, you know, in something that has a defacto for the people who don't believe in God anymore. Many of them still believe that artists are trying to do something authentic and truthful to their, to their inner being.

Speaker 4:          00:17:02       Isn't the word religion fairly loaded though, and what isn't, what's important? The idea behind what you're trying to do, right? The idea is that you're trying to make this sacred place. You're trying to make this amazing place where people can go and see expression and see, you know, the purity of your creative vision. What, why, why connect that to a loaded word?

Speaker 2:          00:17:24       Because it's, as Jesse said in my book, I think it's, it's too easy to run away from that. It's a, it's a, you know, how a bad neighborhood gets, you know, and it's just like, oh my God, it's only criminal. So live here. And then some artists show up, you know, and they start having their studios and various things like that. And sooner or later, a really beat up neighborhood will start to have some vitality because creative energy, creative energy starts to infiltrate into destructive energy. What I'm saying is if the artists would move back into the world of religion, we might clean up the neighborhood a little, you know, and make it a more habitable for people to want to look at their relationship with spirit through even the lens of religion. But why? Why religion though? Because religion is associated in most people's minds, the deities realia religions associated most people's minds with aiden and traditions, ancient traditions that oftentimes stifle your behavior, tell you what to do, control you and offer horrendous consequences for not complying.

Speaker 2:          00:18:54       That's what a lot of people think of when they think of the word religion. So here's this thing, but you hope, but let me get to this real quick. You have this thing, this beautiful thing, like why even put a name to it? Why, why label it? And when you're labeling it, you're connecting it with all these other religions that are so problematic and you're going to have to explain your way out of that. Why do that instead of just have this amazing center, um, because I feel that we're a maintenance lead connected with whatever that religious impulse, and if you look at the, what is the primary religious experience that is a mystical experience regularly geo to reconnect, to connect up, to link back because that was the word man. Yes, to really link to reconnect to what the self to God, the Self and God so that that's the actual origin of the word.

Speaker 2:          00:19:55       Religion. Religion says it a Latin word and French, French and it's to reconnect. So the idea being that the religion or these churches were set up so that people could reconnect with God. So they go about their day. They were filled with troubles and strife and all sorts of stress and they can go back to the church and they can reconnect with God through religion, through if you go to Egypt or you go to a. You just came back from Venice and you go to some of these religious cathedrals that are a thousand years old. You go to these pilgrimage places and there is tremendous power because a lot of people invested a lot of love and energy into a center and they built a shrine to whatever they believed that spirit to be. And that is part of a long tradition of a connectedness with, uh, you know, their lens into the infinite.

Speaker 2:          00:20:56       Whatever religion you're looking through, iconic, an iconic, yes, they're a hell of lot of trouble when you get to the secondary, uh, religious, uh, you know, experience, which is everything else that you think about religion, the primary religious experience. Every religion started with a mystical experience and people are having those on acid every day now, you know? And so what he, a disconnect from that whole tradition where people were connecting to the infinite before and you say, this has nothing to do with that, you know, or do you say, hey, religions fucked up. But what if we reimagine it? What if we reimagined God, you know, and can't, can't we do it? And say, this has a lot of, a lot going for it. This quest for the infinite, absolute mystery. That's at the core of our being and the core of the cosmos. This quest to know that it leads to science that leads aren't.

Speaker 2:          00:22:05       It's the. It's the quest to know the truth about the nature of reality and so that quest is another reason why I think that if you harness that to creativity, just artists, artists hate dogma, you, you can't have a dogmatic. I mean our artists always disagree and you're always going to have new vantage point. You're always gonna have one evolving a point of view. That's part of the trouble of religion is that they get, you know, this is the right way and it's only like this. We're not going to look beyond our boundaries of what, you know, people made up long ago as the way it's supposed to be in another century when you know, we didn't know any of the stuff that we know now, so that does make sense. So any good religion ought to their view of reality, at least science ought to be incorporated into it. So you couldn't have a truthful religion without science.

Speaker 1:          00:23:13       Are you planning on writing something out like the tenants of this religion, the ethics of this religion, we actually have liturgy. In order to become a church you have to submit liturgy to the irs and the state attorney general and then we had to. I'm familiar with what's our word, liturgy, liturgy, like a, like a document, like a, you know, like stuff that you use on a regular basis in, in your ceremonies, so you have that in order to be recognized for it don't have to do,

Speaker 3:          00:23:46       but it's part of the irs a requirement and estate attorney. Do you have a liturgy? Liturgy? You can say no. Yeah, you probably could probably apply and maybe you know, it's all in your head relax. It's like a guy has to look over what you're doing and really question it and see if you've thought it out and stuff like that. Alex published art psalms, which was a poetry book and you've seen so that was really submitted. That was submitted as our, as cosmic liturgy. Perfect. Um, well that's, that's work is really fascinating is the tax exempt status of religion. Religion is so odd in that way, that worshiping and being in a place where you worship, even if it's very clear that there's a lot of profit being made, you don't have to pay taxes on that. I just want to tell you this little, just a touch of the history of why we became a church because it wasn't really ever our intention to become a church all the way from the beginning when we 19, 85 and we visioned the temple simultaneously. Alex and I on our first Mtma a journey lying on the bed. We both came out of it having vision. This circular, a building in 1985. We had recently moved to New York together doing mdm back in 1985.

Speaker 3:          00:25:10       Jesus, but we both saw this temple and we knew that this was sort of like our, our joint mission. This was the thing we were going to do together. You know Alex always. We met in art school, so Alex always had his art and I had my art and we shared a studio, but this was something we were going to do together. So we never thought we would become a church to know, but here we were building the sacred site and then all through our life together, you know, we uh, started visiting sacred sites like we just came from St Mark's and Venice and we see sharp cathedral and you know, we go there with groups of people and you know, like go on pilgrimage to these sacred beauty, beautiful art places. But anyway, uh, the way we became a church was um, a friend of ours who started Sirius satellite network.

Speaker 3:          00:26:00       Actually, she's Martine Rothblatt, but she, she loves the work that a actual lives. Alex's work, she's a collector, she loves the work. We're doing awesome with the community and all this. And she said, you know, you're doing everything that churches do. You're doing weddings, baby blessings and morals. You have, you have a prayer book, you know, basically arts and you're doing everything that churches do and you're not getting any of the benefits of what churches get business thinking. No, she's so smart. Really? And she paid a lawyer. She is the one that funded, granted us, you know, getting together with our, with our guy who, who when we went through the process with us, it took a good long time. You have to basically write a lot of essays and then they give you more essays and it was maybe three times through essays and you write them all and then you submit the liturgy and eventually just at the moment we were moving to the country.

Speaker 3:          00:26:57       It was like the same minute. The church status just magically came in after four years. It was like all like coming together, you know, so as it is though, we have 40 acres and then we had to fight with our town over, you know, every church in our town and there's every, there's mosques and Buddhist stupas and you know, lots of Catholic and every kind of Protestant. And they were not paying real estate tax and we have this 40 acres and they were raising our taxes 15 percent every year. Meanwhile we're not making any money. Alex and I are volunteers that caused them by the way. And so we'd make nothing. We just give it away and the whole place we're giving away it belongs to the community and the community is everybody whose spiritual and creative, but it tends to have a lot of psychedelia files.

Speaker 3:          00:27:48       People who feel like they've, they've experienced the divine and they want a place to go ahead and talk about it. They wanted this in the city when we were in Manhattan for five years. It was just a place where you could go and talk about this because it's legal to talk about it and we would always have security and make sure there wasn't anything being passed around because we can't get into trouble because we were like a really legitimate. We're doing this in legitimate way. We have to took us four years to get our permits to do this building. You add security to make sure that people didn't pass drugs around. Well, we can't have anything visible. What you do that is private is your own business. If you can behave yourself, we don't. We watch out for you and we. I understand that, but you had a bunch of people actually watching people to make sure we always have security.

Speaker 3:          00:28:38       They're gentle giants. We call them gentle giants. You have to have security when you're having. We have hundreds of thousands. Well, some of our full moons are from hundreds to a thousand people. We have large groups of people. That's what, what happened was a sham and told us that, uh, we, we, we had this whole idea of this temple we wanted to build, but where's your community? You know, building a temple is the work of a community. He said, so we're going to start full moon ceremonies in your home in Brooklyn. So we did. We started in January of 2,364 consecutive, full moons ago. We started them in our loft in Brooklyn and then we went to, we got a place in Manhattan, 12,000 square feet. We did it for five years. Then we found this permanent location in a whopping journey. York, it's in the Hudson Valley.

Speaker 3:          00:29:33       We were like 65 miles from the city. You can get there on the train, but we found this lovely old retreat center all kind of imploding and you know, and we've been working on at one building at a time, the carriage house, which is turning into an theone, the first temple of visionary art that we really came there to build his building for. Actually we have a 10 bedroom Victorian guesthouse and a office in our studio. So we have, you know, we have six buildings to work on and we're on building for. But uh, anyway, that's. This is like a little retreat center that we're leaving to our community, our spiritual, creative cosmonaut community.

Speaker 1:          00:30:15       It's fascinating that Martin was involved in it because she's also involved in artificial intelligence. I interviewed her for the Scifi show that I did. Yeah. And she has this robot version of her wife Bina four, eight, 48 or whatever. Yeah. Well, she started a church. She being a started a church called the terrorism movement. We need to start a church. You should. Joey Diaz already has a church, which he just joined his Joey Diaz as the Church of what's happening now. There's some great churches out there. I really just think it's why should these Catholics get it all? You know what I mean? We shouldn't get it all. No. I think after you involved in like the 100th child molestation, he probably should take. You're probably take it away and that's. That's like super conservative number. That's horrible. That crazy religion. Religion doesn't uphold that. That's just awful people. Yes, but

Speaker 4:          00:31:17       awful people all throughout that one religion. I mean there's gotta be some sort of a connection with suppression, suppression of Sexuality, suppression of ideology, forcing people to behave in a certain way and these blow backs and the also the fear. I mean I was raised Catholic and I went to Catholic school when I was a young kid and I remember I didn't go to kindergarten. I just went right into first grade and I remember the fear, the constant fear that they injected in you this, this idea of what religion is. It was great for me because it, it just queered me off religion so young. So early off I was like, oh, okay, well this is all nonsense was before that. When I was young, my parents were getting divorced and my parents are splitting up. I was really scared. I was really nervous and I was young and there was a lot of violence going around.

Speaker 4:          00:32:07       There was a lot of yelling and screaming and I needed something and so I remember when I was little I was always talking about God and it was just like, well, there's got to be. If all these people around me are out of their mind and everyone's crazy, there's got to be God. So I was actually excited to go to Catholic school. I was excited to go to church. I thought of it as well, me, maybe these people that these relatives in these family members that I live with are all crazy, but there's going to be a place that I can go where I'm going to be able to be loved and it's going to be calm. God has rules and everyone's gonna follow them, and then I went there and I was like, Oh, good Lord. No Pun intended. This fucking places worse. I was like, these people out of their minds and my.

Speaker 4:          00:32:52       My parents were going to put me in there for second grade and I literally told him I'd run away from home. I was like, I'm going to find my way out of this. I'm like, I'm not doing this, and it was seven, you know? I was like, this is not happening. Well, you have already become rational. It's seven. You knew you had a bullshit detector that was always acutely attuned. Well, that's one good thing about growing up in a really fucked up household is that like you, you, you're, you're, you have a constant sense of danger because you're around danger all the time. So you don't get to sleep cuddly. You don't get to like rest calm and you, you, you have an acute awareness of all the possibilities. So I mean ultimately that was a great thing for me. I can, I can really see how that it heightened your ability to also to always maintain that mindfulness, that over everything.

Speaker 4:          00:33:53       It's what, it probably allows you to do so many things. It's also, there's, you know, there's always a balance between mindfulness and paranoia. You don't want to be that guy that carries a gun to the bathroom. You know, there's, I know a lot of people that have surpassed this, uh, awareness and gone into this like acute paranoia. I have this statement that I've been saying a lot lately, but I think it's important to bring up. I don't think human beings are designed to take in the bad news of 7 billion people. I just don't think. I think the numbers that we deal with on a daily basis with all the different stories of the world, they are too much for us to handle. It's not how you're supposed to deal with what's going on in your community with a watchful eye on the rest of the world.

Speaker 4:          00:34:37       You shouldn't be deeply engrossed in all of the most disgusting aspects of the rest of the world. Twenty four hours a day. And I think that's one of the real problematic issues of our time with social media and with the news that people have this distorted sense of what the world is. They think this world is just filled with violence and horror. No, the world is fine. It just occasionally has violence and horror. There's just so many people and the world is so big that if you look at all those people and this giant globe that we're on, then you can kind of get a sense that the sky is falling, but you know, but if you go outside right now in woodland hills, it's beautiful. It's nice. It's always the worst thing happening in every area. Sometimes it's not, but it's so rare. It's like occasionally they give you some good food with her feet and your poison. You're about to die. They slip you a piece of fruit.

Speaker 4:          00:35:37       Just. I just don't think it's good for us. I don't think it is and I think that's the same thing with someone who grows up in a bad environment. I think you could. You could get a distorted perception of what the world is and think that that the bad environment that you're currently in is the entire world and it can shape your perceptions and your interactions and therefore shape how you react to other people and shape your actual reality. You know, it's one of the things that have truly tried to impart upon people that I've learned and I believe that how you treat people and your interactions with people literally change your reality, and this is from mistakes that I've made and this is from positive decisions that I've made because I think that when you look at life in a positive way and you try to treat people kind and you try to be nice to people and you try to move forward with that, the people that you interact with, they will get that. They will most likely respond more kindly to you and the world changes. The world literally changes in front of you. It's billiard balls.

Speaker 2:          00:36:37       Yeah. You know, have have kind act that could be sending waves. A smile could actually prevent somebody from committing suicide. That's all it takes. Maybe you should just go ahead and end it.

Speaker 1:          00:36:54       Well, I heard from some from some kids who are really desperate and I going to jump or am I

Speaker 2:          00:37:04       not? Some stranger looked at me and smiled. That's and that stopped me from doing it. Alex, what still have meat? Acid stopped me from, from killing myself because for me, I wondered whether God exists. Just like your question when you were seven, you were hoping that there was something that was not a it, you know, that there was a center of peace somewhere. I guess now I don't know that I would ever call God at center of peace. You know, I would say that that's one aspect of the entire, you know, meet storm of being alive. I love that word,

Speaker 1:          00:37:50       but what I read express, meet storm. You should make a t shirt says meets dorm. That's a great band. Radical band. Hudson Valley. Meet Storm. We have a grinder attached to industrial fan folks. I wouldn't think about it that way. I was thinking about a bunch of people just jumping around, getting crazy. There you go.

Speaker 2:          00:38:23       Word. Well, I thought of that when I saw the last judgment, but I make glands. Well, speaking of Catholics, so you gotta look at the good things like even probably some really terrible stuff happened in those Howard halls in the Vatican, but again, really awesome art.

Speaker 3:          00:38:43       Yeah. Yeah. Have you ever seen the Sistine Chapel? No, I'm actually going there this summer. We spent an entire day from nine until five. We got there, the front of the line and got in the way all the way there. You got to run all the way through the Vatican. Well to know you don't want to do that. Yeah, you do. Why do you want to run? Well, we went to Chapel Sistine Chapel. Oh, so you got to take it and then get there in time when it kicks in. We were there all day from nine to five drawing. We just sat. We got a seat and we were just drawing all day and our focus, it was just unbelievable and the drawings came out really amazing too. And so we had been to Vatican before, I have to say. So when you go to the Vatican for the first time, you have to walk through so you can see all the amazingness of the way there because the sistine chapel is at the end of the tour, you know, you'd go out there and then afterwards you come back. So. So you, you know, on the way you want to take a look, but we had already done that so we were like made the decision, this was our day to draw man, you know, so I got it.

Speaker 2:          00:39:53       I just, that was all I wanted to see. Anyway. So it, everything else is just a blur and then you get to the Sistine Chapel is quite fascinating that you're looking at the work of someone who lived hundreds of years, 500 years ago. Amazing.

Speaker 3:          00:40:08       And he didn't like everything that Castle Catholics did by the way. He did. Well he didn't, but he did like being Catholic. Okay. He, he really did. He wrote about it and was very eloquent and he loved being healthy, but he didn't like the pope telling him to paint the Sistine Chapel for instance. Look at that, look at that. How long did it take for him to do that? I

Speaker 2:          00:40:29       don't know. Years and years. They last judgment is the one that was, I guess I've always called my favorite painting of all time. That's the meat storm. It's like a, you know, and there were no clothes. I'm a figures on that. They, Michelangelo was still alive when they got, um, a, uh, what they called it, uh, he was, uh, he was a good fresco painter, but he became basically Michelangelo's breaches, painter, you know, he was always thought of as the one who added, you know, clothing and drapery over the genitalia that Michelangelo had painted. He loved the body and he, uh, made one, I would call an anthropocosm out of it, want a kind of a temple of humanity. And it was very much about the nobility and connected with the Greek idealist. That Greek idealist tradition is a psychedelic tradition from the neoplatonic in the platonic, you know, socrates and all the rest. So that wave was just getting, uh, he, he was there when they dug up. They, Lao coon, you know, the Greek sculpture with the snakes and the crazy stuff that it really deeply influenced him.

Speaker 3:          00:42:00       I just wanted to say that the purity of the religion place where it, it's really true, you know, like that beautiful, you know, what would it actually means at the, at the core, at the heart core of any religion is expressed through the art of that religion. So you know, the other stuff is crap. You know what I mean with the way people act towards each other and stuff. That's their own deficits and their own obstacles coming out, you know, all over the place. Even the pope's that have been horrible and allowed, you know, uh, you know, child molestation to perpetrate those people are sick people that has nothing. They don't represent the purity of the religion, which is the representative and they are. But what is that? What is the purity of the religion and doesn't vary depending upon the individual. And why does it, why does that? I don't think anybody, every religion that what we're seeing is the purity of one man's expression. His, his view is beautiful view of the world. That we're so fortunate to be able to still look at

Speaker 2:          00:42:58       true 500 years later. What does that have to do with Catholicism? I think that because he was part of that tradition and he was marrying the ideas of the Greek ideal and the ended neoplatonic, uh, which was all about universality, you know, it was really more about it. They, as much as we're saying, you know, all religions are connected and are basically talking about the, the one spirit that moves through all of us. You can call it creative spirit and I prefer to call it something like that rather than, uh, some of the names that get so heavily weighted. But I'm comfortable with the word God. To me, God means just ultimate mystery. Yeah. We discussed this a couple times on previous podcasts though. How weighted that word is. It is. Well, one of the things that I think is amazing about the Sistine Chapel, when you're looking at the two fingers touching, when you're looking at all these beautiful images, those images, they become what people think of when they think of God and they think of religion. Those images, they almost like it takes a form on and in taking on that form, it gives you a structure to house the ideas and the ideals of these religions. Like in seeing something, a visual representation, it

Speaker 4:          00:44:32       becomes a real thing in that. It's an idea that's an idea that becomes embodied by that art.

Speaker 3:          00:44:39       I grew up in the Jewish tradition, which is a non iconic tradition and you know, this is the Christian tradition really is. It is a story of a person. They were born, they taught, they, they healed, they died, they rose. And in the Jewish tradition there is, it's an non embodied. So I, you know, I resonated with that when I first saw God in Lsd and it was really not a person's face at all. But I recognize that this is what people are talking about when they're talking about God, which is this energy that's, you know, interconnects everything, you know, it's like the force more than a face. So, but that was my experience of God and I. and, and, and in that experience when I was 20, I recognize this is what people are talking about when they say God, it's not physical.

Speaker 4:          00:45:31       Yeah. Energetic. What I'm just saying is that in this guy creating these iconic works, yes, he gives it a structure. It gives it like a scaffolding. And in that scaffolding of these beautiful paintings, you can kind of like form your own categories and have your own like chapters in your mind that exists that someone, it's almost like makes those things real. Whether or not they ever were real, whether or not they're ever angels on clouds, it's almost inconsequential because the, the result of it is kind of the same. If you believe that it's real. If you believe, and this is where religion gets so fucking squirrely because are you saying that Adam and eve were the only two people in the world and everybody came from them? No, absolutely not. Are you saying that there was a snake and he told eve? No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

Speaker 4:          00:46:20       But if you operate your life as if those things were reality, and if you operate your life under the ideals that are transcribed and described in these beautiful paintings, it will become a real past in the sense that it will have a real meaning to you. It gets real weird in that way. And that's where I create weird art in general. And your art is particularly important because the things that you paint, you can actually see. I've seen a lot of the things that you paint. Maybe not specifically, but one of the things that I remember when I was first introduced to some of your art, I am, I saw, I forget which one it was. I forget what you have seen so many of your pieces, but I remember going, oh, this guy's seen it like 100 percent. You've been there. Like when I thought of tryptamine experiences and I saw your art, I was like, oh, this guy, he's a.

Speaker 4:          00:47:17       He nailed it. I mean, some people have come kind of close. They've kind of. But even though what you're showing, it doesn't exist in a static form, in the tryptamine dimension, like there's no way you can take a, you know, you take your phone and you take a screenshot and you don't, you want to, when you're in there, you went to press that button and say, God is, say that now. That's good. Now can I just press the movie? How can I capture this? Well, the problem also is it changes every fraction of a second. The, the, the beautiful thing about the tryptamine experiences is that whatever visual you're experiencing right now will morph into something else. And it was one of the most important lessons that I ever learned while tripping was um, in a dmt experience. I had a bunch of negative thoughts.

Speaker 4:          00:48:07       I don't remember what they were about, but our member, the visions that I was having turned dark and like do like a dark green and black and twisted. Like there were contorted and compressed, like a visual representation of negative thinking. And then I realized that these, whatever these things are with entities, thoughts, whatever they were trying to express to me the actual negative consequences of thinking like that, that it showed me in a visual form, and then I relaxed and thought positive. Eddie literally bloomed in front of me like a flower and then change into this wildly beautiful geometric pattern that was like dancing in front of me. And I realized at that moment like I'm, I, I realized to myself, I said, I have to remember this, I have to remember this and I have to figure out how to express this because this is a, an incredible realization that it's not this like abstract idea that, oh, you think negative, negative things happen. Think positive. No, you're literally manifesting energy. You're manifesting a certain kind of energy with negative thinking. Or it's one of the reasons why we like getting away from negative people when someone's like really negative and complaining and whining. He just like, oh Jesus, I got to get outta here. You're like, you really feel like they're going to suck me in other vortex. I've gotta I've gotta escape.

Speaker 2:          00:49:31       Yeah, there's, there is, um, don't see, you could think of it like an Amoeba around your physical body, cloud of pulsating thought forms and uh, as you're imagining a, you know, a, the beautiful elements of life and things. It's, it seems to be in a kind of order and uh, and maybe kind of wafting upward it. These are like, uh, the, the spiritual positive, uh, kind of frameworks. Sometimes you are seeing life through when you're tripping, you know, and seeing the connections between things lines forming and things like that. The, the more kind of organic geometries that, that show up, you see this intelligence of life and the, uh, the, the light of divine intelligence that came through for allison, like in the language, it seems to be weaving things together. And when you're in touch with that infinite light that seems to be the source, then that is you can keep it upwardly moving and very evolutionarily caught cosmically consciously moving forward. And when then you're thinking regretful thoughts or thinking negative thoughts and anger and things like that. There's a constriction that goes on in your heart I think, and kind of shuts things down and that kind of, like you were saying, twisting in, curling in and, and darkening and, and things are, are all things that when you're journeying, you see them manifest literally in the flow of your, the theater of your imagination. And so I think you really beautifully described that. Uh, just in that I was totally there.

Speaker 4:          00:51:36       I think it's a disease of consciousness. I think it's very similar to catching a cold that, you know, uh, you don't see the cold, you don't see a disease, you don't see it, but it affects you. And I think there's an analogy to be made about diseases of consciousness that you can get locked into these terrible ways of looking at the world. And I think that's one of the most important things about what you're trying to do in terms of building a community. That if you can build a community and build a, like a conscious ideology that that is sort of a prescribed to people and establish a very positive and loving environment. You can spread that. Like you can spread a disease, you know, or for no better word, a lot of seeds of love or whatever, whatever you would call it. I mean you could do it the wrong way, you know, you could do it what the Nazis did and do what gang is Khan did and do it.

Speaker 4:          00:52:35       Some horrible people throughout history have done similar things and a lot of ways because there are diseases of ideas. They're diseases of consciousness or you could do it the right way or a good way or a beneficial way or positive way. And it seems like throughout history we almost have to see those negative ones to learn the consequences of, of letting these things happen. I mean, it's one of the reasons why Germany won't let in the scientologists that like, Hey, we've seen what happens when cults takeover, okay, we've got a deep history with fucked up group thinking, so let's just not let you guys in. And it's what we were talking about before the podcast. We were talking about trump and what's going on in this country right now. And I was saying that I think it's probably a good idea to have this moment where we realized like, oh, we really have to pay attention. Like we, we can't just sit back and not participate anymore because liquids happened when it's a mockery. The hold system is like been exposed by this one guy as being a joke. And it's always been a joke. It's just been a joke that we've accepted, you know, and we were talking about Hillary and all the criminal investigations that she's under. And that somehow or another, this one person who we know is insincere is a better option than this other person who we know is a jerk off. Like, what? Where's the right? And where's the.

Speaker 3:          00:54:01       I don't barely been an election where that isn't true. I thought Obama was a pretty clear choice and there was a lot of celebrating afterwards. But of course then he disappointed people like he's predicted he would at his inauguration. He said, I'm not going to make everybody happy and you're not going to always be happy with me. He, he, he predicted that and he came through with that. But I remember all the elections of my life. It was like, you know, I mean, I always voted for the least worst person. You know what I mean? I mean, I think Al Gore was, was, was up there. He was really good and I, you know, and I actually won and he actually won where the, uh, the coup took place. Right.

Speaker 4:          00:54:45       There were corporate America took over. Yeah, it really did. I mean that's. Well, it's also where the system that we're voting under is exposed. They're still using pieces of paper. And then also the, the. Did you ever see hacking democracy, the Hbo Hbo Documentary on the Diebold Systems?

Speaker 3:          00:55:02       Oh my God. I'm. So, his brother was a vice president there, work there, there before

Speaker 4:          00:55:10       they, uh, before they were making voting machines. Whoa. Yeah. They actually changed their name after that documentary. Is that they establish a voting machine where you can, I recommend everybody watch hacking democracy. I think it was from, I want to say 2007 or something like that. Yeah. But it was a documentary where they exposed that these voting machines, not only can they be manipulated, they were designed to be manipulated, they were designed to have a third party entrance, like a third party could enter in data and it's just madness that those machines are how our election got decided and you know, they've since then cleaned it up and in some way, but still it's a dirty system. Doesn't it seem like we could actually have some encryption that each voter could vote online? Exactly. And do it in a minute. Sure. And uh, and we'd know.

Speaker 4:          00:56:09       Here's a perfect example. Banking. Everyone. Banks online who, who doesn't bank online who doesn't buy things online, trade credit card transactions with people like, Whoa, we gets hacked. How often? How often? How many people, how? Okay. What percentage of it is it enough to shift an election? I would say it's probably not. I would say it's not. I would say if you could make banking secure, you can make voting secure phone. They couldn't even get into that guy's phone. You know, they, you can do this and so they should do it. Well. Representative government is not necessary anymore. We can communicate instantaneously with people all throughout the world. We're not talking about sending a raven, you know, this isn't the 13 hundreds. This is. This is an interesting time and we're not taking advantage of the resources that are available to us, but as far as representing the actual people, but I think there's also a problem with that too is there's a lot of people that are just completely uneducated, uninterested, Slovenly, lazy people and we have to energize those people.

Speaker 4:          00:57:07       We have to reinvigorate their ideas of participation. Enough community and you have to say like, look, you can't just sit on your couch and eat twinkies and watch beverly hills housewives. You can't do that anymore because if you do, you're not allowed to complain about the world being fucked up because you're a part of the world being fucked up and I think in two weeks weaken energize people until we can give people the sense that they actually can participate in and it is just a bunch of human beings that are trying to figure out the right and the wrong way to do things. I think there's a lot of that going on right now. I think there's this ebb and flow of social media and positive aspects of it and negative aspects of it, but ultimately I think a lot of that is just us learning to navigate the landscape.

Speaker 4:          00:57:52       This new landscape is digital, interconnected landscape that's unprecedented in human history. We don't. I don't think we can understand it because we're a part of it. I mean, I think we can sort of. We're talking about it, right, but I don't think if we look back in history and they a thousand years from now, look at this day, the way we're looking at Michelangelo or Leonardo Da Vinci or gang, this con or anyone, you look back and you go, wow, what a crazy time. That's nothing compared to today. Today is the craziest time ever. The emergence of artificial intelligence, the emergence of a very bizarre method of communication where you can instantaneously reach people on the entire planet where data is shared like that. Well amongst hundreds of millions of people instantly. It's a new world. It's a fucking crazy new world. It's a birth. It is literally like a birth, it's like an organism coming out of an egg and poking his head out and right now the shells being chipped and the heads popping up, but this fucking thing's going to merge and it's gonna fly will turn. Dr Dan talked about the noosphere, you know, about the thinking layer of the earth, you know, and that's really what enabled, I mean, you talked about it in the mid, Mid 20th century and uh, so this thinking layer, a thinking atmosphere that's around the earth now through satellites, through

Speaker 2:          00:59:22       all of the, uh, interactive technology that we're currently speaking on, you know, is a new body for the soul of humanity. You know, this is now, uh, what we're, what we're working on now is the theo sphere. That's what we've got to tap and access. Now. We have a connectedness with each other now as a symbol that shouldn't really clue us into something important. If we look at other nature systems like the, my celio intelligence weaves the woods together and that we have our entire soil and makes it alive. Really, uh, these are spores a connected by fibers. And that's what we are.

Speaker 4:          01:00:15       Well, if you can explain what what's going on in the Pacific northwest in regards to that, like how enormous the actual individual organism of my sealy connection is. And the Pacific northwest. It's essentially like someone described it. I might've been Mckenna as like a thousand gray whales. That's how big this organism is. And it's essentially one interconnected mushroom. Like, whoa. Yeah. The biggest thing on earth being on earth is a mushroom. Exactly. Well, it's the oldest being as well. You know, we're more like mushrooms than any other plant. Yes, yes. They, they actually breathe in oxygen and breathe out carbon dioxide like people. You know, I've been incredibly fascinated over the last few months with plant intelligence and with plant communication and calculations and this idea that plants have some sort of a consciousness. And one of the things that I've been tripping out about is acacia trees, where if an animal eats them and the wind carries the scent of the Acacia tree being consumed, the bushes and trees downwind smell it and become bitter so that it discourages predation. And animals were starving. The downwind animals were starving because they wouldn't eat the bushes from the trees that had taken the scent of the trees that were up north. I mean, it's madness and they were literally sending out a signal to the other plants, hey, hit the alarm. We're getting eaten. And they're communicating with each other.

Speaker 2:          01:01:53       Absolutely. It's the underground and overground a network of plant intelligence. So I think of basically the festival culture as being mushrooms that are growing out of the underground intelligence graves and stuff like that. Those are the little fruiting bodies.

Speaker 4:          01:02:13       Coachella though right now. I don't know what kind of a is southwest

Speaker 1:          01:02:20       man. Bernie man this summer. I just want to tell everybody out there. Come and be part of the Dr Bronner Foam Dome Camp and get yourself sprayed with foam and see us do paint our mural. So Dr. Bronner's soap. So we're going to be in the maps. Brawner camp. The maps is the multidisciplinary association for Psychedelic Studies. Many of us know and they have the Zendo where people go when they need some help and then there's also a. wait a minute. What's that mean though? That's where, you know the rangers, when they go around and they find people who are triple, I'm having a bad time. They go to the Zendo and they take care of them. They're, they're, they're helped the Zendo. Oh yeah. We, we have a Zendo at cosmo. It's, well, it's a place for meditating and chill out to get away from the frenetic energy and just have a place of peace from that smells like feet.

Speaker 1:          01:03:20       It's really beautiful and it sounds strange, but it's made out of wood and bamboo and cardboard. So how do they construct that out in the middle of the bringing in pieces and ended up like they do everything else there. Wow. How long does it take to put that together? People come over like a week or two ahead of time depending on how complex you could put together. But we did a dome in 2006 with maps and I'm Matt Atwood who did the infrastructure and uh, it was called the n theone village and it was deadly [inaudible] village for years. Alex named it. So now we have empty on growing and causing. But it used to be, uh, at, at burning man. But anyway, it's. Did you go? No, I don't go be around that many hippies. It's all kinds of people. But it is the freest place on earth. Certainly infested with hippies though. Let's be honest with ourselves. Well now the people who are using Sacramento I to take objection for a moment and speak for the hippies because. Because I think that this is like one of the last places where it's okay, you know, like it's no longer okay to say nigger or queer. Okay. Got or you know, to have that, you know. So if you're a Hippie, maybe you could call another hippy, a dirty hippy kind of a hippie.

Speaker 1:          01:04:46       I'm essentially a weird version of a hippie. I don't fit into the mold because I'm also a cage fighting commentator. The diversity and, and you know, the burning man used to have the genital portraits studio and the portrait studio. Will you punderdome you would love was like, I should know. Fuck man. Range guns. You should. They have open bars

Speaker 3:          01:05:18       there and they're giving it all away. The thing about burning man is it's a gift economy, so it's an experiment in gift economy. You not once you get in and it caused something to get in of course, but once you get in it's like you don't take your wallet out, you can't pay for anything and there's no bartering. It's only gifting and people give it away. Yeah, there's the thunder. They're like nerf sticks. It don't really hurt each other, but they. But they knocked them to try to knock them off of their perch there. Although they're swinging on those ropes in that dome. It's a dome frame. Anyway, there's all kinds. There's 80,000 people there. It's the best, biggest, most amazing environment. It's like being on the moon. It's like not like being nowhere else on earth. You have to always carry your ma, your dust mask and your goggles and your hair covering and your camelback.

Speaker 3:          01:06:08       It's so drawing that you have to be drinking like a couple of gallons a day, you know, just to, you know, there's no insects there. There is not a blade of any kind of life there. It's like walking on the moon seriously, except you can breathe, but you have to have a face man because the dust storms just come up at any moment. It's anyone done a documentary on it many, many over the years. So when you're there, there's dudes taking cameras in your face. Isn't that sort of. Do you have to have permission? Everything is very regulated now and I understand they're behind, so I'm hoping they'll have some good because they'd been. Yeah. That was an infrastructure where you said that like somebody offered you a a beautiful cake and buying land. Land is good for our community. We should own our own places of of attraction because that is the way you gain transformational power, power to transform.

Speaker 3:          01:07:04       You basically have land in place and you build that infrastructure, this culture, the way it's structured. Isn't that beautiful? It's really cool. It really is beautiful. The center part is called the Playa and it's about nine feet across from from end to end. Like big circle, the biggest nine miles, feet, nine feet, nine miles across, and you can walk the whole way. A lot of people have art cars, miles, well from, from edge to edge, that's incredible. Outer Edge. It's managing people. It's good. Sixty to 80 and it's payable and everybody takes care of each other. You have to have your own food. You can't. You got to come in there with water, food and everything and you're not allowed to pull her or drop anything on the ground. If you, if you have and they have full showers. Broader camp is, you know, you get foam.

Speaker 3:          01:07:59       Do you know they have a big foam dome so. But you got to collect all that water and they collect them in these great big gray water tankers and take them away and bring in fresh water. It's like they're practicing setting up a village in, in light of the apocalypse. I'm telling you this is the practice ready? Yeah. These people can go in and in a week or two. I mean the government, I mean the army went in there to study this because they could do this in a couple of weeks. They put it all together. So it's very much apocalyptic preparation. You know, you would think you would get great benefit from seeing it and get material out of it. You should come be with our camp, you know it, the, it is the week that leads to Labor Day weekend. So that's like the first weekend of this is the first Monday of the first Monday of September is Labor.

Speaker 3:          01:08:55       So it's the weekend before the Monday of Labor Day and they have the temple burn is on Saturday night and Sunday night and the man is burned on Saturday night. So when the man is burned, you know, 100, 800,000, 80,000 people come together to see it. It's like everybody comes in a big circle around the man. Where's the man? There he is. I think it'd be like you're gonna get the fuck out. And you know what? They have a thousand fire spinners around the man. You have to. You have to audition to be a fire spin around the man, but they have about a thousand of them and they're spinning whips. My friend Joe, they're spinning swords and poor boy and and all kinds of Hula hoops are are on fire. It's the most amazing thing and you go there on your art car, you're not allowed to go in, apply at all unless your car is approved as an art car.

Speaker 3:          01:09:48       That means it has to be show some art cars. Our cars are incredible. They've got big ships like rolling along the Playa, you know they have gigantic three stories. Structures that move to kind of be enhancing the environment they do and they have to be all they have to be art. And the reason why they even do them at all in one big way is so that you can get on the top of them so that you can see over everybody else. When you go to see the man and you can see all these fire spinners that are all around this. You want to be up high, so you're part of dinosaur, your party, your parties up there. It's all you got your own Dj. Seriously, this, this car, it's got its own Dj mine where Alex painted it and we're going to be on the Mayan Warrior this year.

Speaker 3:          01:10:37       Check out the line. How does that work? People pay year round to park these things in, in girl latch. You know an outsider is the non town. It's like this town that grew up around Bernie man. They have like one store, you know, it's like you drive into this moon like planet. This, this place is where wallboard is made. Okay? So if you peeled off the paper, that's what the Playa is like in. It's like a skin. You're not allowed to drop peanut shells or anything on the ground and you have to collect everything. So it's extremely. And

Speaker 1:          01:11:14       you, you learn about saving water, you can't believe how much you try to, you know, save water, love the mine. That's beautiful, isn't it? You? What did you use to eliminate it with all the painting is our. We'll just click, click on one, stuck on it, stop flipping around. Just go to that show. The mask painting area that me on all over the course, you know, how do you power that thing? They do it. Jay do it. They all do it. They all have to have light on it. You can't even have a bicycle on the plier without leds. But what is what is illuminating this, I mean this is for people, for people listening alone. This thing is filled with beautiful lights and this, the flower of life is in one of them. And what are the other ones? The blue ones above the flower of life.

Speaker 1:          01:12:04       There's more flower, the flower of life. But also notice that there's a second story and if you scroll down a little bit, you'll see there's a third story. See those people up there. That's loyalty. Those are the DJ's and the royalty royalty. I'm just joking, but really it's like, you know the people who own the Mayan warrior up there and they're best friends. Oh, I thought it was your friends. Oh No, no, no. It's painted it. It was a commission. This. They brought it from Mexico City on its own trailer. They drove it from Mexico City to cause them. I would've thought that it was a Trojan horse field border. The border patrol have everybody out. Well, was all enclosed in this trail. I was enclosed to the. Definitely don't worry. We looked. There's no Mexicans in here sneaking across the border and will ask for your Trojan horse. Alex's collectors are probably the most well meaning, you know, they have the most means of all Mexicans I would say. What are those stacks? The stack things is two stacks. Yeah, it looks like Sydney blogs. Those are speakers.

Speaker 1:          01:13:14       Disco, you're all going to go deaf. You bring your own Dj baby. What if the music's annoying? What kind of music are you playing? Only cool shit. We to see these are people that produce our events in Mexico City and they sponsor us going down there and doing it, you know, like for events for a visit. And we've done it a few times. So they'll do a workshop, they'll do a day lecture, you know, they'll do a and then they'll do an evening event and given any event it's an electronic dance music party at a big, a big place, you know, and we're on stage painting. So these are producers that they produce for bigger names than us. I mean way bigger, but we do our thing down there and so we've got a bunch of bikes behind it as well as that. With that is.

Speaker 1:          01:13:57       Or is that people parking their bikes, you know, they come up, they hey, can we come up and have a ride to though you to have one of these? Some people have motor. Well you have to have a. well I don't know. We'll find out there though. Don't they give you ear beatings? Don't they find you? And then go. How's your hair covered? Hiding. Completely Open. Why do you want to have? Well we go in and we, we, we paint our mural. That's when we see our station. You can always come and find us at the foam dome at our 32 foot mural that will be painting the wandering around with a gas mask on and goggles and head dress in the middle of a gypsum forest. Sounds so ridiculous. This guy, for sure. Some of these people are extremely wealthy. Looking broader. These people. This is the, I would say the highest festival I've ever been to. That guy's definitely broke. Guaranteed.

Speaker 1:          01:15:07       You must be saved up all year. Now he's met that guy. It looks like the alien that they found when the movie alien. The guy that's a guy from Google comes to this guy from Google. The children of the inventors. You sound like a spokesperson for now. We're either. We've only been. This will be our fifth time. She. Let me go back to that one. The girl has got that blue one above there. The blue light one. That seems like some industrial strength. Gas Mask type shit. Seems like particle mask. What about dust? You have to have goggles.

Speaker 1:          01:15:48       I sent sense your enthusiasm. I appreciate it, but fuck that place. When I was 14, it was the first time we went. We were invited. Every time we've gone, somebody who's brought us our daughters, our daughter, when she was 14 and we were there, will smith goes to burning man. A lot of freaks should use it like a mecca. You go watch. It's a higher. If you're a freak show every year, five times. Seems like this is a great idea in a shitty spot and this can be recreated somewhere habitable. How about that? Perfect. In so many barriers. The reason these are, it's an art festival. They make a sculpture it and they put it on the bare ground. It's like going into a white gallery, you know, it's like going into like a white out and then you put an object there and frankly you've got a lot of space around it so you can really look at any man's sculpture, sculpture.

Speaker 1:          01:16:56       It's about seeing the art, so it's not for everybody. I think that it's an extraordinary, a outgrowth of visionary culture. I'm totally joking around obviously when I'm mocking it, but that's my nature. This fire fire before know we. We were. We have a sculpture at cars and that was on the plier to two stories sculpture at at and we're getting another one. People with them afterwards, they went someplace to put them. Will cause them. Has 40 acres, so we're gonna end up with probably more so they're going to ship burning man sculptures. We do that. Oh, you going to ship it to us? We pay for it. That's amazing. That and it that. That's incredible. And you go out there and you just visit all these sculptures. It's nine miles of sculpture. You just go ride your bike from sculpture to sculpture. Many of them, most of them are interactive so you can go inside of them.

Speaker 1:          01:17:55       You can climb up in them. They sometimes they have swings and a lot of them have fire coming out. That's incredible because you can. You can light things on fire there. That's what makes it so exciting to us. This is the Belgium, the Belgian waffles, Kate, Kate, Kate Rod, which sculptured cause what? Cade Rod, but she does a laser cut cold rolled steel sculptures that are, that are interacting with their pods. You sit in them, they're real comfy there. Oh, this is amazing. We're looking at, for people that are listening, we're looking at Mars. One, look at verse one, sculpture. For people that are listening, we're looking at this geometric object that's circular, but it's got squared edges. What would you call that? What does that, what does that a sacred geometric form. And these guys are.

Speaker 1:          01:18:48       They're from San Francisco. We know these guys. Um, and this, whatever this geometric form is, what's making my chandelier? This? Yes, they're making my chandelier's for, for Ian. I'm going to have chandelier's, uh, that were light where they turn and the light falls on people. It's environmental. It's called Jamie a fest. Three hundred a sneak peek at the coolest art coming to burning man. So you could see this, uh, online. If you go google it, it's really stunning. This image. Okay. So there's a magazine that has a bunch of these images. Oh God, that's amazing. That's cool. Almost worth going. Yeah. Maybe if you bring a big tour bus, bring an Rv, you little. You don't want to come, Joe, if that. You want to come with him. Are you kidding? No, we don't care. How long does it take to get out there? Where is it? Let's see. Tens of thousands of people do come from. Where is it? It's a black rock city out in about an hour from Reno, Nevada. It's probably got a lot of nuclear energy out there, right? I will do those tests you ever see that? Um, the animated Gif. It's like a little movie of all the nuclear tests

Speaker 2:          01:20:08       that they've done in Nevada might explain a lot about what's going on out there. I've done hundreds of them just to, to digital digital. They did this thing from like 1940, whatever it was the time when they detonated the first atomic bomb to present at the bottom of a see that once was made of crushed shell and you know, it feels like sand, but if you walk on it, he won't be able to use your feet in the middle of the winter. That's what I'm saying is if you're out of your feet, you won't be able to use your feet in the middle of the winter. Tracking the cracking. Even in the middle of winter. I did it once. I'm just telling you it, it, it, it. I had to walk back from the man to our camp without any shoes because I lost my shoes and I walked back through and it feels like sand at first, but then it's like knives.

Speaker 2:          01:21:03       He likes little tiny little knives. They're like shells. It's like crushed, crushed shells and it messed up your feet and all winter I was dealing with cracked feet, happy feet burning. See you have to wear boots and really cover and it gets to be like 110 degrees in the day and 40 degrees at night. Sounds like you're trying to keep me off trying to keep me off the thing. We're building a place at caution that is going to how some of the sculptures and have little sculptural areas, so we have these small gatherings by comparison to that. They'll never be huge like that though, but hundreds of people will gather so it can still feel kind of tribal and community oriented, but a lot of the same music is enjoyed. We always have fire circle and we always have fire spinning. We actually teach fire spinning it cause of getting, not of hand like fire.

Speaker 2:          01:21:57       All that fire spinning around there. Those people are the most cautious. And we also have a relationship with the fire department. They're in our town. We have a sheriff on property, uh, at the, at each event where there are large numbers of people. And so we, you know, safety first, but there's ways of doing it. So when do you anticipate this entire thing? The entire cause of them. We should tell everybody. That means chapel of sacred mirrors. That's what caused them stands for. And when do you anticipate that being fully operational and inaction? Well, right now it is open. We're open like four days a week so that people, we have an ongoing stream of people who just are visitors and there are a small art exhibits that are on display now. We're working on anthon. That's where the grand exhibit will be housed and they exhibit that we had on display for five years in the city that is not currently on display.

Speaker 2:          01:23:03       The sacred marriage are not there, but they will be in the new space. And so the new space, as we said, we're thinking we'll open sometime in 2017 probably toward the end of the year and then, uh, as, as we can, we will build the outside of it, you know, the sculpture, it's just a matter of how many years it's gonna take. It's gonna probably take a few years ago when the power go lotto. Yeah. Yeah. Then you were able to do. Donations can come in all these things. We get donations. I think all these things can happen. I mean, the kickstarter thing. Look Joe, you were really helpful to us when the last time we did the podcast, there was definitely a Rogan bump that happened to the kickstarter that took us to a new level. Say good news is that there's probably what,

Speaker 1:          01:23:57       how many more million people listening know, like how many years ago was it that you guys came on last three years? So that was, we're getting pilot 4 million downloads a month, probably tripled that night, I'd say three years ago at least triple. And then with the youtube. Youtube. Yeah. So let's say we're in the neighborhood of 30 million downloads a month. Joining us and being a temple builder, joining us, um, I think that there's going to be a lot of people that are excited about it. I think what the idea behind it is beautiful. The idea that you guys are leaving it for the community and building it for the community. Beautiful. And uh, that's one of the best arguments for religion that I've ever heard and best arguments for having a religion be tax exempt that I've ever heard. I mean, you guys are literally doing it for other people and you're doing it for everybody.

Speaker 1:          01:24:51       It's awesome. And you know, your artwork is just a huge fan of what you do. And I just think that the design itself is literally, like I said, probably the coolest building on the planet and it's a real. I mean, what you're doing is essentially an extension of the great works of all these, you know, when you're talking about the sistine chapel or if you're talking about the Egyptian pyramids or any of these sacred sites that exist all throughout the world. You're doing a modern version of that and it's, it's amazing. It's really, really cool. 50 greatest works I think will be on view there in their original form, but the actual paintings that alex roped with his own hand and some of them have become really iconic to people. There are a lot of people out there that have Alex's posters and tee shirts. Oh, I have a bunch of plays and everything. But to see the originals, that's a study for other artists, clay, the prints that a lot of people have, the limited edition prints that they have of paintings that wonderful labor intensive artists is made. I've never heard that word or that word, limited edition prints that I've read it. I just thought that was like leaky or something.

Speaker 1:          01:26:01       Well, the other thing about anthem

Speaker 4:          01:26:04       is that it's going to display the work of the International Visionary Art Movement. And uh, these are, I mean, if you liked my stuff, you should see some of the young people that are making art out of their journeys. Now they're, you know, they're evolving beyond, you know, my work. And uh, also I think they're building an encyclopedia of these dimensions of altered states that people can say it was something like that, but it's very specific in that if you go back before the 19 sixties and you look at the art really didn't represent the trips. It, it just didn't. Um, and you look at it now, there's a giant body of art that represents these psychedelic trips that really didn't exist before. So in a lot of ways it is a quiet new chapter in the world of art that one day I think people are gonna look back on.

Speaker 4:          01:27:00       And once we realize the ridiculousness of the prohibition on drugs, especially on psychedelic drugs, nontoxic, non-problematic as far as like health repercussions. And you wonder like what, what was it about our restrictive society that put this sweeping comprehensive ban on psychedelic substances in 1970 and what were the ramifications? What was, what were the consequences on society? So there was no organic, there was no eco eco careers, there was, there was no, you know, save the planet, talk climate change. We never heard about that. Growing up. There was, there was people that were talking about it and they were circling, certainly people that we're recycling and composting and doing things along those lines and trying to leave a smaller footprint back then aware of it, but as far as a gigantic global conscious movement and also the urgency that's attached to it today where people are stepping back and they're looking at islands disappearing and you know, they're looking at the rising sea levels and they go, well blah blah blah, blah, blah.

Speaker 4:          01:28:04       This is real. This is actually happening inside of our lifetime. There's a lot going on that I think we're, we're, we're in the middle of and I think this visionary art that, that is going on right now, we're sort of in the middle of that. I think as we look back on it, or as people passed us, look back on it, they're going to say, this is a very specific era. This was an era. Like if you go back and look at religious history and you look at the, um, the enlightenment and you look at the various styles of art that's connected to religion or cultural change, you know, you see these big shifts. I think the visionary art of Psychedelics is a big shift. It's huge. Yeah. I think that it's the, it's showing that the big news today is the Sacramento, uh, sort of reformation.

Speaker 4:          01:28:59       You know, that there's a return of the sacrament to the West. It's been demonized and hidden for thousands of years. Now it's back and you're not going to get rid of it. Now it's here because we need it. There's nothing that's going to turn consciousness around toward a sacred planet that wants to save itself from self destruction like psychedelics. There is no greater prescription, uh, for soul medicine. Then this is the stuff that is curing all of the traumatic stress of, of the vets, you know, marijuana is part a, is leading the way in the medicinals and opening the door literally for the sacred drugs, the return of the sacred drugs. Now we don't even have a context a established in America, but it's beginning, you know, the UDV church one, their right to use the sacrament. The native American church has pod. There is legal precedent for religious use already.

Speaker 4:          01:30:09       The best there has been throughout history except for the last couple thousand years. Well in, uh, in this country, as you were talking about with Mtma, I mean, just a really the last few decades. Yeah. And I'm five methoxy dimethyltryptamine and I bought that stuff online, like in the 2001 or something like that. You can just order it from some chemical company. They sent you a bottle of it and get the whole world hot. I remember that. Yeah, it was great times it. Yes it was. And uh, somehow we've got to find a way to incorporate these sacraments. I think they're being incorporated. And I think one of the things that you said that you just sort of glossed over, but it's incredibly important is that marijuana is the door opener. Yeah. Marijuana is the guy that you let into the party that has the magic dust and they went and he blew it on everybody because once that gets in and especially edible marijuana, edible marijuana is a psychedelic drug and many people don't know it.

Speaker 4:          01:31:05       And that's one of the reasons why when people eat brownies or something, they'll say, oh my God, someone laced the Brownie. No, that's what it is. That, that is the most potent form of marijuana is the editable form of marijuana. And it is very visionary and especially in high doses, it's incredibly introspective acid, like in a lot of ways you know, you, you get a perspective that is life changing and shifting and it's one of those directional shifts where even if it's a small degree of change over the course of the rest of your life, that small degree of change could equal a very large shift in the direction that you're going as you continue down your path. That slight turn to the right will make a huge difference five years from now, 10 years from now, I think marijuana becoming legal in Colorado and we are seeing not just the positive benefits in terms of the community you're looking at that are making way more money than they've ever made before.

Speaker 4:          01:32:03       You're looking at housing prices, real estate prices going up. People having a new sense of community where they like, oh, there's others like us. It's like a magnet for freaks and they've all flown into Colorado and set up shop there. It's fascinating. I did a show there a couple months ago at the Belko theater and it was amazing. It was like this place has changed in a year. I recorded my last comedy special. I'm about two years ago, two years in August in Colorado, and then I did the most recent one about six months ago in Colorado. The most recent show that I did there, and I could feel the shift when you driving down the street, you see the difference. There's pot everywhere. There's people are smiling. The lowest incidence of drunk driving. They've ever recorded. Lowest incidents of violent crime. Everything is dropping suicide rates. Yes, and money.

Speaker 4:          01:32:58       Money that the state is making isn't insane. They literally, you have a surplus of taxes. It's an attractor. They've made more money from taxes from marijuana than they did from alcohol for the first time ever. No one's ever done that, and you've got this happy community and now Seattle is entered into the mix. Now Washington DC's enter into the Mexican November. California's going to vote on it. I guarantee it's going to go through it. Oh yes, of course it is. Try to extend a little blessing New York way. Okay. Because New York is so far behind. I'm so ashamed of us. Come on. We got to move into action and our people little happen. Just love it so much. I think that just the. The ideologies that are were in place that stopped it. There roading. Those people are too old. They're too out of touch. They don't understand the mindset of the young people and they've really underestimated the power of this movement. They. This is a wave and you can't suppress it anymore. You can't lose of people that are upwardly spiraling. Okay. The people that are healthy, all positive ecological, save the planet educated more thinking. It's such an attractor and so everybody wants to be part of. They wonder what's. What is that? We'll have a power. It's what we were talking about earlier when we're talking about plant intelligence, there is an intelligence in marijuana and absolute undoubted intelligence when it exists. I think in all plants that exists in funguses as not that

Speaker 2:          01:34:28       not all plants are mirroring systems inside of the human body like cannabis, since it was the probably the original or one of the original culture cultivated plants. I think that humanity over the millennia worked out a symbiotic relationship with this plant and so we have the endocannabinoid system and then the, uh, and I would say that probably many of our health deficiencies are because we're not getting our cannabis thc efficiencies and uh, no. Well, let's try. The Ama in the thirties went to Congress and said, please don't make cannabis illegal. It's in half of our Madison, you know, for 87 years. It's been part of the American Pharmacopia. Please allow us to continue to use it. No, it was struck down and so it's been repressed a sense then. And a lot of it has just been pure racism actually. That's the cause of it.

Speaker 4:          01:35:34       Well, that was what those recent papers were released about the Nixon administration. That's one of the ways they demonize the black rights movement, civil rights movement, and also the antiwar movement is they attack marijuana and they attacked psychedelic drugs and that was the reason why they pass that sweeping legislation in the first place, was just to be able to have a reason to arrest those people. They knew they could attack the communities and attacking those communities. The best way to do it was to go after the drugs next and hated them. And Nixon was a traitor to America. Nixon was probably with Bush, one of the worst we've ever experienced. And through his hatred and venom, we have the drug war that now for over 40 years, we've just been laboring under the boot of a fascist trader that want resigned from office.

Speaker 3:          01:36:29       He was, he was, he was impeached really? And that I wanted to say, go back to what you were saying about fungus, because people sometimes ask, what does l, what is Lsd, what does it, what does it look like? What is it? And I wanted to mentioned that, uh, recently there's microscopic images of what it is, is it's fungus growing on Rye. So there's these microscopic images that you can call up and look at that. See the LSD. It looks like a field of little tiny mushrooms. That's all just microscopic.

Speaker 4:          01:37:03       Well, do you remember the, um, the revelation that they had the few, few years back when they were trying to figure out what caused the Salem witch trials and one of the leading theories was that they had had a late frost and the late frost had caused these funguses to bread, herbal or God to grow on bread and that when that happened, these people were experiencing very acid like effects from eating bread. And then they started freaking out and blaming people for it and thinking that they were being possessed. And it was a whole wave of paranoia that came from that unbelievably fascinating. When you think about it that way, it really is. It's actually the, uh, to be cured from ergotism. Um, this, uh, uh, Bishop, uh, Flo bear, he was responsible for sharp cathedral

Speaker 2:          01:37:56       a thousand years ago, basically prayed to Mary and said, if you'll cure me of this ergotism, uh, which is very dangerous, but it leaves so many visions, I will build you the most beautiful tempo ever built, you know? And so he was cured and he did found a sharp cathedral. But, uh, as a result. So that's one of the core things about ergotism Ergot, but the coolest thing is definitely lsd and Hoffman's ability to stabilize that. Uh, yeah. Uh, and then, so basically the coolest thing about the psychedelics to me is that they, uh, in the end, the science that has been done as the Good Friday experiment and Roland Griffiths work and that has basically given us the best evidence for the existence of God because 65 percent of people who take psilocybin in it safe, set and setting in there spiritually inclined, we'll have a full blown mystical experience that's now science. It's proven. So a majority of people who take a psychedelic basically in a positive setting and they don't know, they're not a priest gets sold themselves, you know, not a borderline personality. If you're stable,

Speaker 4:          01:39:14       priest gets zone. Yeah. That's important to put out. You know, because I think that a lot of people think that psychedelics are for everybody, but they're not. Unfortunately, there's some folks amongst us that have a very difficult time with just regular stable sobriety and mental issues.

Speaker 3:          01:39:28       No, but I think in the end they're going to, with science, with medicine and science, I think what's going to be found out is that, uh, these psychedelics are going to cure schizophrenia. I really think that when they, when they use it properly, because that's what the science is doing now, they're experimenting with all kinds of, with schizophrenia what science is, if there's any studies with schizophrenia. But I, I, because it mirrors schizophrenia, it may be, um, I don't know. I think that research will be done related to all kinds of psychological illness and um, but anyway, it's curing so many things that can cure a cluster headaches. And the studies are, you know, like Harvard, Yale, Johns Hopkins, all that big, all the big universities that can, that maps can get funding for their funding. All that

Speaker 4:          01:40:20       maps is really fascinating and amazing. And what they've done is just add a, a, an actual intellectual perspective on psychedelic drugs and undeniably researched really well documented perspective. That's so important. When I had, um, my first experiences with, um, with maps, I remember thinking like, thank God there's someone like this out there. Some someone like Doblin out there, Rick Doblin, who has taken the super intelligent approach to recognizing what

Speaker 2:          01:40:54       these substances are and what are the positive benefits are and how can you get these things slowly but surely through the legal system and that's what they're doing now with Mtma. That's what they're doing now with the studies that they're doing on a soldiers with posttraumatic stress disorder and all sorts of other people to police officers. Anybody rape victims? Yeah. Violence victims. I think that's, it's so important. It's just the, these are really beneficial things that were being denied and were being denied by people who haven't experienced them, which is the most ironic aspect of it. It's like something having penicillin, but they won't let you try it. Yeah. Because, you know, they don't use it themselves and we know that such things as Ibogaine exist. There is a way to interrupt opioid, uh, addiction and the addiction process. This is a potential cure for, uh, the many millions of people who are currently opiate addicted.

Speaker 2:          01:41:52       Ibogaine therapy has been working out miraculous results for people. It helps them turn around their lives and, uh, to uh, stop needing the chunk two to three days. Yeah. Yeah. That's, it's a treatment. It's literally miraculous. We know it exists. It's a, you know, the Department of Defense. So how to be using it for our poor fats that have returned from an unrighteous battle. The whole cause of their suicidal behavior, I believe is because they were told to go buy into an unrighteous battle. It was a war waged on lies and only to create basically to kick a kick the Hornet's nest, you know, to keep an endless war going. It's working pretty good. Well, posttraumatic stress disorder. What's really fascinating about it is that there's this reaction to stress too intense stress, traumatic situations and that your body has. This is almost this intense anticipation of a constant battle of constant stress and that that can be interrupted and that this is. There's really no other method. I mean, you can go to therapy all your life and slowly perhaps slowly erode the memories of this and give yourself some psychological tools to manage these experiences. But as far as like something that can sort of stop it in its tracks, there's never been anything that's demonstrated that has the power of psychedelics. Post traumatic

Speaker 3:          01:43:27       stress disorder studies are showing that 85 percent of vets that have at and are otherwise untreatable are, are having success after one treatment and maps got a grant to do a second and third trial. That means that people 15 percent who didn't, uh, you know, really feel relief from posttraumatic stress disorder,

Speaker 4:          01:43:52       get a second turn and a third term. So it's, it's amazing, uh, many

Speaker 2:          01:43:58       the substance, but it's the psychological therapy relationship.

Speaker 4:          01:44:03       Well, it's also the reset, the reset, the control, alt delete for the mind, the resetting of the consciousness that I think so many of us operate on momentum. We operate on the momentum of our past and that's all we know. And that's sort of the, the, the, we, we were, were connected to that momentum, like a safety blanket. Like we, we believe that this momentum equals the future. And then it's very difficult to get out of those grooves that are so deeply carved in our consciousness. That's right. And almost nothing does it,

Speaker 2:          01:44:33       but MTMA will allow you to get that distance and a for you. And in order for you to, uh, transform out of a phase, you know, the psychologist basically say that you have to be able to look at your subjective state from an ob, you know, another objective observation on that subjective state. And so that's literally what's happening with the, uh, Mtma your distanced from it. You can look at your behavior or your, uh, what happened to you in, with more dispassion. You can have compassion on yourself, you know, and, uh, start to forgive everyone involved. And it's, it's a miraculous, uh, and life changing, which then leads to new neuro growth, uh, in both suicide and a MDM May. They've been charting that there is new neuropathways. Uh, not only does it just feel it that way, but it literally is that way is changing your minds, changing your brain and your mind. Alright folks,
