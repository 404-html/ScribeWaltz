Speaker 1:          00:00          The Joe Rogan experience.

Speaker 2:          00:03          What were you saying before the podcast started? You were gonna bring it up again about veganism coming from a religion.

Speaker 1:          00:08          Yeah. Veganism started with the seventh adventist church, I believe. So there was um, a, you know, a group of people that had a church and the guy that led the church as part of the church was like, you know, they were following the Jewish kosher laws or whatever at first and it was like no pigs or whatever else. Shell fish, I think pigs are shellfish and then the guy just said like, it just sort of took it to a next level and said like, no, no meat, no animal products at all. And so these people that were in this church were like the first real group of vegans a church. I've seventh adventist I think is what it's called is where it came from, like 18, 63 is when that movement I guess started everybody. Sure. I'd started early. I'm sure people were doing it earlier than that obviously, but I think that that's where the roots came in and I just find that really interesting because it does, you know, it does seem like a religion, it seems like, um, they, it seems like a lot of times you get, um, I get called out a lot on instagram and stuff like that from people that are Vegan saying like, I can't believe you'd do this and blah blah, but I would never go on their page and say anything to them at all there

Speaker 2:          01:15          proselytizing. I mean, that's, that's a big part of this whole community is, it's, there's the moral high ground they stand on it and then a lot of these people, especially people with Vegan in their name and their screen name, they always go after people that try to shame people and what they're doing is in many ways is a very good thing. They're not participating factory farming, right? They're not participating in the horrors that we see these fucking peta videos where you see cows and pigs and chickens. They're just being tortured. All that. Fuck. That is disgusting. And that should be eliminated and it shouldn't be a part of modern culture, but in terms of like the humane raising and killing of animals, look, they're not going to live forever and I don't care what you say. I'm not into animal suffering. I don't think they should suffer, but if you try to say that people are not herbivores or that people are herbivores rather, and then we're not omnivores, you're crazy.

Speaker 2:          02:07          It's just not true. It's not fact and they show pictures. These are not the teeth of a carnivore. These were not carnivores. Stupid. We're omnivores. Yeah. We looked real similar in our teeth to fucking chimps. Chimps are omnivores and the human diet is a very complex thing. When you attach that human diet to ideology, then it gets really, screw it because you're not dealing. You're not dealing with people that are being honest about dietary, like what is really important and for dietary requirements, how your body functions. What the studies show. If you look at it objectively, the objective, the first thing anybody should say first thing across the board, get rid all the fucking sugar. That's number one. Get rid of all the refined carbohydrates, eat more vegetables. I think you guys don't eat more vegetables. Eat healthy fats. Get some form omega fatty acids.

Speaker 2:          03:00          Recognize that the omega fatty acids that you get from flax seed oil or not as bioavailable is fact from studies not as bioavailable. Is it? Mega fatty acids you get from fish and meat, they're just not the meat. The protein, you say, well broadly has 15 groups, not as bioavailable. You fucks and you know it's not. It's just not. Yeah, so you can get bioavailable protein from plants. You get it from him. You get it from Keenwah, you get it from peas. PEA proteins. Very good. But it's not as good as the protein that you get from meat. It's just not. That's a high right, but no. You never saw 100 beck from the bottom right, like lower back. We can make that like a lumbar pad. Work as a lumberjack. Yeah. Yeah. Sleeps all night and he works all day. Like if, if you look at Roy Nelson, he's like the size of a really good middleweight yeah, no, he is.

Speaker 2:          03:59          Yeah. But meanwhile, the guy knocked out, Chuck Congo, knocked out, Brendan Schaub, knocked out some big fucking heavyweights, knocked out Mitrione. I mean fucking isn't announced and knocked out. A lot of people actually have. They'll show. Did he knock out? I think I do not remember that fight. Oh. Um. And it was the worst thing is it's with his right hand. So you would think that people go to the hill to left up. Yeah. But somehow he connect anyway. It's like, you know what's going to happen? We can stop it now. Almost knocked out over him. Remember that? Yeah. Yeah. He heard over him. Yup. Stephen's true. Jesus Christ crazy. I mean Roy is like six feet tall. Stephan struve seven feet tall. Yeah. I mean fucking animal is an animal. And I honestly, I mean look at his gut right there. How much is that? It weighs about 2:50, right?

Speaker 2:          04:57          He's, he, I'm not bullshitting. He is 50 pounds overweight and he's a world class athlete. I mean, you cannot say that Roy Nelson is on a world class fighter. You just know a world class fighter and he's 50 pounds overweight. So you dropped down 50 pounds, now you're 200 pounds, you make 85, you cut weight, everybody does that cut 15 pounds or 85 year old world champion. You know, there's no butter bean. You know, we were somewhere, uh, and the lead commissioner told me from all the boxes on the card, he had actually the best blood pressure and cholesterol. He said we weren't a shock that the guy is in phenomenal shape. That's what they told us. Yeah. That's insane. Butter being made. Him Look like Rodriguez. Look at him. Jesus Christ. Actually, he looks good. His whole family. He looks exactly like that. I hear go upper right hand corner. Yeah, that's what he looked like when he was at its worse. Meanwhile he's another guy knocked dudes dead man. He is so funny at such a good time with him. And there was a prince George in Kennedy. He was there. He's a player. That's hilarious. Very funny guy. That's funny. You know, he's a fucking hell of a cook apparently you can't tell, but it's like there's food watching a video of butter beans cooking some ribs. And I was like, damn, that looks legit. Like yes. Smoker. Who's cooking them in a smoker? He broke the rule though. Don't get high if your own supply. Jamie was watching the video of soccer Berg. How did it go? He should know the answer is

Speaker 3:          06:37          he dad had to go again today and uh, I was watching right before you got here in this, I don't know where she was from, but she was saying like, you're the CEO of this company and you should know some of these answers. And she was like, listing all the shitty. Didn't know it was like this is ridiculous. And then I afterwards, now they've shown, which I guess it's part of nonpublic information, has notes. Oh no, that he had like as references that he was looking at. I've only seen one picture of it. Just very weird stuff that like, seems blatantly obvious that he should know or should say that's different from what we've. Maybe we think we should. Yeah, I think they should be able to.

Speaker 2:          07:08          Fellas, I get the impression that this company grew so fast, they don't even know what the fuck is going on in now. Well, that was the other thing he was talking about their influence on possible. Are we going to continue? Will continue, don't worry about that. Um, he was talking about his influence on all these different upcoming elections that were coming up and about how they wanted to make sure that there was no bots that were influencing these elections. And I stopped and thought about it and I'm like, oh my God. In that moment of him saying that, I realized like what pressure he must be under, what pressure that companies under there. They went from being a thing where people could share pictures like of, Hey, this isn't our summer vacation. And like, Hey, you know, fucking we're going to go to the pub on Friday. That's what facebook kind of was, right? People would talk about certain things in the news. They would have opinions. You put up something, a bunch of people comment on it. That's what it was. Now with this last election and with him testifying in front of Congress, what I'm seeing is facebook being like one of the most important sources of influence in the world today, and it's not really being completely managed. Oh, oh,

Speaker 3:          08:19          awesome. You're like the Russians, the Russians. Yeah. Maybe there's a little bit like Google needs to be looked into. What was going on with my mic? So Google also probably like they have a data. I think someone was just looking into this, you know, people downloaded their facebook profile and they're like, my files one gigabyte. Well, how much data is in here? People found out a way to download theirs and find their information and what, what does facebook know about me? Apparently there's also one that Google has on everyone and it's much larger to the busy.

Speaker 2:          08:47          Ah, Ooh. I'm not shocked. I don't know. There's, there's. And here's the thing that it an endless cycle. Yeah. I mean we just don't have that next unacceptable word, right. You know, like everybody knows. I think a lot of people know that as far as somebody who's a doesn't have is developmentally disabled. Retarded was kind of the latest term that was once acceptable. It's clearly not now. I mean that is kind of the point, but before that, you know, moron was a medical term wasn't. Yeah, mongoloid idiot was what they used to call 'em down syndrome children. That was like 100 years ago. Yeah, it was on the birth certificate. Right. But I'm saying, you know, people who are saying, you know, just to stop saying they're not wrong, that you know, but there is also another word down the pipeline, right. There's something else that's coming that's going to be a medical word or term and then that'll be used to insult people, but that's the way people use language.

Speaker 2:          09:50          Like once we identify this is the word people use to label someone with a developmental disability, people in the slang will grow from that. People will start using that. Well, what's interesting to me is that when we're talking about words, you're not going to change the way people think. So words are supposed to convey. Intent is supposed to be sounds that we all agree mean a certain thing and the more depth, the more access towards you have, the more you can sort of flavor your conversation. So I understand what you're saying. Like if you're saying this guy, I kinda get it, but you feel like this fucking guy. I'm like, well Tom is really mad. You know what I mean? That and to take that out. Yeah. It's like I don't know. So sometimes you take those things out when you're like on a television show or something like that, but all television shows because of that all censored television shows only exists within a certain band. Yes. A certain frequency. They never get out of that. Like the Joey Diaz frequency is like, ah, there's no fucking roof. There's no fence. True. This, this frequency that you get on like late night talk shows or sitcoms, this very narrow band that, that there's no contact in that band. There's no, you motherfucker this. All those things are not in there. Which is what you're all about. I feel like whenever you're. For me, when I'm watching something like that, part of my brain's always like, go find a motherfucker somewhere. You kind of want it.
