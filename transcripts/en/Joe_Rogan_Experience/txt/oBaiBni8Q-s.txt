Speaker 1:          00:00:03       Sweet baby. Jesus. Here we go again. Did Jesus people get upset? Have you? Sweet Baby Jesus and like a nice way because I know they get pissed. If you say Jesus fucking Christ, they don't like that. No. If you say sweet baby, Jesus in the manger, it's good. It's all good. How about if you only say sweet baby Jesus in a nice way. See Baby Jesus. Sweet Baby Jesus. Sexually sounding though like pedophiles. You're tasting Jesus. Sweet. Sweet. You do. Don't they do eat the flesh and drink the blood anyway? Yeah, that got freaky. He's responsible for basically any creepy notions that people have just by that, even if that's true, why tell people, but keep the kid. Give him some bread and wine, which we barely believe he came back from the dead. All right, we're supposed to eat you, drink you. This has nothing to do with anything. This podcast is brought to you by audible.com.

Speaker 1:          00:00:58       If you go to audible.com forward slash Joe, you can get one free month of audible service and one free audio book. What is audible? Did you pay attention to the second part? Pitch? I said audio book, put it together for yourself. What do you think audible is? Well, audible.com is an amazing resource of thousands and thousands of audio books. It's really bad ass of your commuter. Like we can only put out so many podcasts and most likely, if you're like me, the reason why this podcast started a half an hour late because we live in Los Angeles and there's too many fucking people here. So you get stuck in your car and it could either be frustrating or you can listen to some cool shit. Uh, I was, uh, listening on the way up here to a podcast so you can do that. Or you can listen to audio books because in podcast oftentimes, especially if you read this, listen to this one, you're going to get a lot of information that might not necessarily be true.

Speaker 1:          00:01:54       It also might not necessarily, might not necessarily be able to be pronounced. It might not necessarily be good for you. We might tell you some shit just for a goof. Okay? But if you get like a really good book, at the very least you might learn something. There's a whisper sync, which is one of my favorite new applications. It's really one of the coolest things I've ever heard of and what it is for audible.com. It's an application that allows you to download a book and a companion audio book. So say if you're at home reading your book and you get to page 23 and then you fall asleep when you get in your car, you have it sync up through this whisper sync, a audible.com application and it syncs up to your smartphone and then when you get in your car, the version of the audio book picks up where you left off. It's fucking brilliant. It is such a great idea and such a great product and Ufford fantastic reviews of this where people are super psyched, so I'm more books are starting to put those in a companion audio versions of the book, but you can get all of them@aaudible.com. Anything that has one of those, a companion books

Speaker 2:          00:03:08       and look what they have all your appearances on. Opie and Anthony, they have your cds. They have a bunch of shit.

Speaker 1:          00:03:14       Yeah, they have pretty much anything you could ask for, you know, as far as like comedy as far as interesting books, books by our friends like well to do. They have Tim Ferriss, Tim Ferriss at war with them. How's that work? Because I know Tim Ferriss at war with all the regular book dealers. Right. There was like a big issue that he had there. They're trying to barnes and noble. Barnes and Bobo. Why you fucking with our friend Tim Ferriss? You silly silly bitch. I know.

Speaker 2:          00:03:42       Steven Pressfield is a great read of his books. I've listened to some of his own. It's actually him reading it and talking to you. So

Speaker 1:          00:03:49       no, those are perfect to recommend because those are two of my favorite books of all time turning pro, which is the newest one. Um, and uh, Steven Pressfield put out a book that changed a lot of people's lives in the creative business and it's called the war of art. And it deals with one thing that really fucks with a lot of people and that's procrastination, procrastination and what he calls resistance, meaning that you're, you're most happy when you get your work done, when you do the things you, especially creatively that you want to do. But for a lot of us, we struggle with this thing that makes us fuck off and you know, instead of doing what you're supposed to do, you beat off you email people you find, you find shit to do, to distract you. And he details us and explains this. And one of the clearest and most beneficial ways I think I've ever heard it described,

Speaker 2:          00:04:45       you'll be surprised you. You read his book, you feel like he's talking to you and be like, Steven, what's up? How'd you get in my head? Because all of the things that prevent you from doing what you could and what you should do, he's talking about the fears, the doubts. The procrastination is like you mentioned all of that and gives it a name resistance. And once you name it, then you can kill it. It's like that Arnold Schwarzenegger with a Predator once, I believe it's. You can kill it. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:05:07       And the cool thing about pressfield pressfield as a human being was essentially a failure at the time he started. Got it all together when he was in his forties. It's really interesting because, you know, he's very, very frank about his old habits and very frank about his old work and you know, what was wrong with the early part of his, his career as a writer and how he turned it around. And now it's hugely, hugely respected and you know, written huge selling books on history has some screenplays that were turned into movies like the legend of Bagger Vance, which probably isn't a good example because it looked like a piece of shit. Then it, oh, it's magical black guy that's good at golf. The fuck out of here, Steven Pressfield, but, but turning pro in the more of our excellent audible.com forward slash Joe.

Speaker 2:          00:05:58       Go there, you fuck and get it free for 30 days and you get a free audio book. And I would recommend the war of art because it's fucking sensational. And you said it's that right? Uh, it should be. I've heard it on audio powerful, audible and uh, we're also brought to you by [inaudible] dot com. And what a coincidence at all. [inaudible] and is here buddy? Well, that's crazy. Why don't you tell everybody about the latest shit because every time I turn around there's new stuff. There's some Himalayan sea salt, which is that a new better for you than regular season Himalayan sea salt. The deal with that is normal sea salt. They artificially produce it and it's sodium chloride. It's artificially produced. So it's not really coming from the ocean. Just bond the chemicals together. And what happens is when they call that sea salt sea salt, but just regular table salt, like what you'll find at your denny's diner or whatever, you know, that kind of.

Speaker 2:          00:06:47       And what they did is they found that people started getting mineral imbalances when they created that and having health problems, particularly from the lack of iodine that people were acquiring mostly from their salt. So that's why you get iodized salt because they threw that back in there. Like, all right, well at least give them iodine back, but what they're missing is the 81 other trace minerals that are found in a natural salt. The Himalayan salt, so has about 80, 80 more minerals than regular salt. It's a great source to get your mineral content and in addition, the reason why the Himalayan is most preferred is because the deposits are like $300, million years old and that's before there was pollution as before big old ships dropped petroleum bombs into our waters and polluted the sea salt and everything like that. It's just a really pristine deposit of salt because it was back in the days where there is just volcano.

Speaker 2:          00:07:36       No dinosaur. Yeah, that's it. So you know, Tara dactyl poo is like the. That was the problem back then as far as far as pollution. So when you buy a biologist, let's just be clear about this though. When you buy sea salt though, something says sea salt, it has to come from the ocean. Sea Salt is pretty good because we kind of said that accidentally earlier you were saying they make it, but I think he just meant tables. Table salt table, salt table, so the difference between sea salt and Himalayan Sea salt is what? It's just more nutritious. It's nutrition as, as lot of mineral content. You can kind of see that in the pink, that's the mineralization from it and so a little bit more mineralization and a more pristine deposit so. And it tastes better too. Once you start using it, it doesn't have that sharp bite.

Speaker 2:          00:08:22       Salt has a real bite to it. This just has the flavor of salt so you can actually use a little bit more salt. Do you use it when you grill? I do, so I use kosher salt. That's what I've always used for grilling. We better really formula though. I know what I'm doing now. Just sobbing. I'm I tried out this week now. What about killer bee honey? I don't. Is that any better than regular honey or is it just bad ass? It's just bad. Just how do they get this killer bees to deposit this honey? I mean, isn't it dangerous to farm those fuckers? There'd be pimp, hand strong. Wow. They

Speaker 1:          00:08:56       just keep them high when they're blowing smoke. That's not weed, but it should be. Wouldn't it be cool if. I mean, I think it's just smoke, right? The idea is the smoke confuses them and calms them down. So why wouldn't you use wheats monk? I wonder if that would affect your relationship with the bees. I fall sudden the hive got super creative and harmony and you could control them and shit. Making art project. Maybe they stopped working for the Queen and the whole thing we get fucked. They would realize that I doing with this queen bee is a cunt. If they would realize like the queen bee is the only be that can sting you and not die. Do you know why? Because she uses that Stinger to murder baby females. That's why lemonade and competent, she uses that Stinger and most of the babies that die in the, in the hive, they die from wounds from the side wall while the, uh, the female walks around a realizes there's a female grown in there.

Speaker 1:          00:09:52       So she pulls out a tap in Paris Stinger and just starts fucking up that baby while its in the Walton the hive. So think about that. Vegans. Vegans will need hunting strict vegans. That's silly. Now you said it is man, but who are we? Who are reading meet these bees work for us man. He's one of the things we were talking about before the podcast and it's fucking so legit. I'm drinking this starbucks coffee and man is it tastes like shit compared to bulletproof coffee and I really do. That is a mycotoxins. Ladies and gentlemen is something that I got alerted to by Dave asprey, Dave asprey of bulletproof exec.com. Fascinating guy with a lot of knowledge when it comes to health and wellness and a optimum living and he sells this stuff called bulletproof coffee and what it is is coffee from a single source that is cultivated and maintained to be mold free and you're like what do you mean mold free?

Speaker 1:          00:10:49       Yeah. That's something I didn't know about either. Most coffee that you buy has mold on it and you know, I'm tasting this right now and it tastes pretty fucking shitty in comparison to this bulletproof coffee because last week I stopped drinking any regular coffee and just went 100 per 100 percent bulletproof and the mycotoxins like really can affect you. They affect your stomach, they affect the way you feel after you drink coffee. Crash. Yeah. Fresh. It's like it adds on. It compels from the caffeine is going to leave your system. But the way that coffee has that kind of savage crashed, it feels like that's from the toxins. Yeah. I different coffee. Yeah. Yeah. I feel very different. That's really fucking disturbing to me that starbucks is essentially selling poison. Who Don't sue me? I'm just allegedly allegedly. Why? Listen to me. What do I know?

Speaker 1:          00:11:44       I told you at the beginning, I'm going to tell you a lot of false shit, but uh, I would like to get it tested. I mean, we, maybe we could do that. Can we test our marks? Can we go to like we probably get sued if we did that. We just didn't use her name. We said we went to Dave's doing that already. Yes, it's coming out. We're actually, he's comparing performance monitors for both bulletproof and for starbucks, so hopefully we'll get there. How do you do that? By a double blind placebo. Someone's drinking bulletproof. Someone's drinking regular and I'm testing some things. I don't think it's a double blind. I think it's more of like an open ended single arm research and doing something like that. Is You gonna name? Starbucks coffee bean. I said Shit. Yeah. That's where it gets troublesome. Those fuckers, they'll come after you, but it would be nice if they didn't sell coffee.

Speaker 1:          00:12:27       That was fucking bad for you. You know, I, I didn't really know. A lot of people when you drink coffee and you feel like shit, you don't really understand what's going on, but you are drinking poisonous fungus. It sounds ridiculous and it sounds like you wouldn't be hearing about that from the fear factor guy feel like that would be some shit that would be in the news. That'd be some shit because so many people go to starbucks. That'd be some shit that we would know about. It is, it's, it's a, it's real. And uh, this, this thing exists, not just in coffee but also in corn. I've been researching mycotoxins online after having that conversation with them, some disturbing shit. Um, but if you try out bulletproof coffee, are we still selling it cheaper than Dave asprey has, is the same price. No, he didn't like that though.

Speaker 1:          00:13:14       You're selling cheaper than him, but it's fantastic coffee and I swear to you, it is different in its effect on your body and you really need to try it to, to understand what the fuck is going on. A stuff's not cheap, but if you could find some other version where you can be sure that it's a microbe free, I suggest go with that. Then do whatever you can, but get that shit out of your life like, I'm not going to finish this because it tastes fucking nasty. Now I got a Venti starbucks. I'm not going to finish it. And that's how much an effect the bulletproof coffee. What Dave's formula for bulletproof coffee is really fucking interesting and what it is is coffee and then he takes mct oil and mct oil is also something that we sell it on it and mct oil is coconut oil that gets thrown through a centrifuge and it gets spun around like wicked fast and they take it, isolates the most nutritious aspect of it.

Speaker 1:          00:14:06       And then they take that out and then he adds this mct oil to the coffee along with grass fed butter. And you blend that bitch, check it out, throw a scoop of hemp force in there. Go licious. Delicious. That is the secret. The secret. I'll remark as powerful move. That's one scoop. Try that. About 12 grams. Yeah. Oh, that sounds good. And throw it in a blender. You want to make sure your blender is tight though. [inaudible]. I had one of them, uh, uh, old school blenders and I tried to make bulletproof coffee and fucking shot off the top and it was a mess. The counter is a mess, but there's a Blendtec blenders can handle it. Um, and, and, and you mix it all together and the coffee is sensation that it's really like some of the best tasting shit you'll ever had in your life. It's delicious.

Speaker 3:          00:14:52       It's like warm and it's like it's creamy because it's got the grass fed butter in it and oh, it's really, really good and I'm telling you will, you will have a different effect and how the caffeine and how uh, how your body feels a after the coffee. There's no big major crash like you'd get with regular shit. And uh, I'm really interested to see what Dave asprey's results are because I tend to think that we're going to realize in a couple of years from now, like, Holy Fuck, we've been poisoning ourselves with fungus.

Speaker 4:          00:15:22       I used to think a coffee and I think you had somebody mentioned it to you, but it was almost like a hard drug at that point was you're going to take coffee, you know that there's going to be a consequence down the. But now you can drink it and I feel consequence free. It feels like, okay,

Speaker 3:          00:15:35       okay. Yeah, sure. I'll have some coffee. No big deal. As energetic as I did during the peak. Yeah, but I don't have that. It's smoother, goes on smoother and leaves me there. I haven't had coffee before. That makes me want to fall asleep. Like you have a company like, oh, I just need to take a nap. Just totally yawning and nodding out. You're like, what the fuck is in that coffee? Poisoned fish. Um, what else? Oh, on its selling its own coconut oil now labeled coconut oil that just got to my house. I'm like, this is ridiculous. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          00:16:06       So what we're doing here is it seems like we're adding a lot of these random things. Basically what we're trying to do is we're trying to create a comprehensive program that can help people on the supplement side, on the fitness side, and give them some key staple foods. They can replace some of their other poorer quality foods with like the salt, like the coffee, like the raw honey. And the key about the killer bee honey is it is raw and the way that you digest that with the natural enzymes included in the minerals way better for you than process cooked honey. So all of these different food sources allow you to replace some other crap that you have. Tonka bars are natural buffalo and cranberry bars, you know, take those and throw out your slim Jims or whatever else you're snacking on. It's just going to be a better alternative.

Speaker 4:          00:16:47       So that way on the food side, we know we're not going to have every food, your staple diet, you're still gonna have to go out, eat nutritious, drink your Kale shakes, do whatever you can, but on some of the staples and some of the additives that you're normally putting in your diet, we're helping to provide a better alternative for that. And then of course on the supplement side, we've all talked about that a lot, but trying to create high performance, highly densely packed nutritional supplements around a certain issue, you know, brain mood, sports, um, whatever we can think of that we can pack together as many, you know, powerful ingredients in one formula and, and provide that and next coming up, which is still a little top secret. We haven't released the details, but we have our, uh, testosterone and performance supplement coming up, which I'm really stoked about.

Speaker 3:          00:17:34       A lot of people think that testosterone supplements are bullshit and the reason why they think that is because most of them are bullshit. But there are some things that can boost your testosterone naturally. Yeah. And uh, the beautiful Zma as one of them. The beautiful thing about accompany,

Speaker 1:          00:17:50       like on it is you own the company so you don't work for anybody. So you can stock the store with cool shit. You don't have to like get it approved. You know, like I've had conversations with you, like the blender conversation. We had a conversation today, man, man, we should carry blenders. Fuck out. It's Carrie blenders, boom. What Carrie and blenders, I mean it's really that easy. I'm one of the things we talked about that we haven't done anything about yet, but we're talking about. We're talking about an on it hunting ranch. We're talking about it and we're also talking about we could start selling that meat, frozen grass fed meat, frozen grassfed, venison and selling it to people. The idea being that if you eat meat and I eat a lot of meat, I want to be responsible at least somewhat for how that animal lives and if we decide to start selling grassfed venison, there's a couple different ways to do it and one of them is if you have a high fence operation, which is in Texas, they have a lot of branches now.

Speaker 1:          00:18:55       Thousands and thousands of acres. They put a big fence around it and there's deer that live inside there and you. You basically set up tree stands, you wait for one to catch up, slipping, and you blast them. Well, once you do that, you can do whatever you want with that meat. You can eat that meat or you could sell it online if we set up a place like that where we can take people on their first hunting adventure, like literally like bring people to a place where you'll allow them to kill their own meat and doing it in a humane and safe way, but do it also in a way where you're relatively insured of success, but this animal is living a complete natural life before you come along and pop a cap in his ass.

Speaker 4:          00:19:39       Yeah, being directly hands on with your food source, knowing what it's eating, knowing what you're eating and being playing a role in that. I mean, that's a part of the birthright of humanity. Not only is it good for your health, it's going to be, I think, important for your spirit if you're eating meat that somebody else's killing your whole life without actually going through the process. Something a little weird about that.

Speaker 1:          00:19:59       Yeah. And there's a lot of people have a disconnect from their food and uh, the idea is that if you, if we had a place where you could go and it would have to be very large, large enough where it doesn't feel like you're shooting deer in the backyard because that's the big knock on these high fence operations. It's canned hunting. Um, but really what it is, is like if it's a large enough piece of property management, you're managing the population of the animals and your manager from other people. Yeah. You procure, you're procuring food and you're essentially like, you're harvesting these animals in a way way different than farming. Like if we started our own grass fed cattle operation, that will be cool. But you know, what you're doing is basically like, and you're setting

Speaker 3:          00:20:48       these animals up to die and they walk around eating grass and you come along and you choose when to kill one. This is it like that more than it is like wild hunting because you know that the, there is no mystery as to whether there. It's like a stock pond. They're there. So it's just about going out there and getting them in a completely natural way, but before you come along and get them, that animal is doing what it would do in, you know, a hundred years ago, a thousand years ago, 2000 years ago. It's living a natural life. It's just living in a natural and it's going to have to do with predators. I mean if you have a large piece of land like that, you have mountain lions period. You have wild pigs period. And both of those eat babies, believe it or not, coyotes, they eat baby pigs or a baby deer.

Speaker 3:          00:21:31       So they deal with probation. It's really a, a, a contained ecosystem. And so we're talking about that. That's the preliminary stages, but I think that's the future pitches can be big. We're bringing you crazy shit. Go to [inaudible] dot com o n n e t and use the code name Rogan and save yourself 10 percent off any and all supplements that does not apply to the fitness equipment because we sell that shit is cheap as is humanly possible to send kettle bells and battle ropes and shit like that through the mail. Um, extreme kettlebell cardio DVD. That's one of the, uh, the workouts that we've been carrying as well. And we're eventually gonna. Make our own DVD. Yeah. Because big. Yeah, we need to do that. But this, this one right now is excellent. I use it. Go there. Check it out on a.com. Codenamed Rogan. Save yourself 10 percent Brian. Cue The music.

Speaker 5:          00:22:18       Okay.

Speaker 3:          00:22:23       The Joe Rogan experience

Speaker 5:          00:22:26       Joe Rogan podcast

Speaker 3:          00:22:31       one day Roy Mcdonald is to ask me, man, why is my voice off fucking distorted? How come you let Nick Diaz talking his regular voice? We fucked my voice up sideways. Son

Speaker 5:          00:22:40       [inaudible]. Why do you do that to him?

Speaker 3:          00:22:43       Good. I'm trying to hurt his feelings. Whoa. I can't believe you went there. I can't even believe you went there. And good luck. So what's up buddy? What's going on, Bro? Yeah man. It's always good. The weird thing, the pause, the commercial, the commercial and then the music and then they start talking part. Yeah. That's the most efficient way to do it. So that's why

Speaker 4:          00:23:04       everything's been good, man. It's been a. it's been a hell of a run Exxon. It's been super exciting. I've been really exploring some of the more non psychedelic adventures in my own life. That had been pretty, pretty cool. Some of those things. Well I guess you'd say non plant based experience is really focusing on deepening meditation. Learned a really cool thing called shamonic breathing, which I was totally skeptical about. Have you ever heard about that? Now what is that? All right. So basically what you do is you create these really powerful breaths and consecutively through notes like that. So you're hyperventilating and you have it's best to do this with a guide because I didn't really know what expect going through. I was just like, alright, whatever. They put on some music and they get you fired up and they're like, give it hell. Do it.

Speaker 4:          00:23:50       Like you're fighting for something great in your life and they get you kind of stoked on this and you start breathing and what you're trying to do actually is create a state where you're, you know, you're purposefully hyperventilating yourself, which is actually manipulating your Ph and then constricting some of the blood vessels that go to your go to your brain. So you're creating choking yourself. Yeah, little bit, a little bit out of her erotic fiction a little bit. So what you're trying to do is like Aldous Huxley would say, is you're trying to obscure the cognitive filter for long enough that your brain allows little gaps. It's like opening the blinds in your brain a little bit so that the rational mind goes away and it allows whatever else that is even pressfield would call it the muse, you know, psychedelic people would call it source or the other, whatever you want to call it.

Speaker 4:          00:24:39       That other information that comes in that isn't quite just produced by irrational mind. And by shutting off a few of the valves, it's actually kind of. It feels like you're opening the blinds. Well, again, I was totally skeptical. I've obviously done some of the most significant plant medicines in the world, so I was like, what is this shit? This is just breathing. But I got into it and the first thing that happens about 10 minutes in as you experienced what's called tetany, they call it and that's where you like get really kind of curled up and you feel like you're, you're, you have like the claw, like you can't stretch out your fingers. Super uncomfortable position with. They're like, keep breathing, keep breathing. And I was like, fuck it. I'll go through it, you know, I'll, I'll see what's at the end of this rabbit hole. And then I did and I pushed through that state and about 15 minutes in it turned full psychedelic experience and it was awesome.

Speaker 4:          00:25:29       It was cool as shit in 15 minutes then 15 minutes or just heavy crazy bravery, creativity and you, you like, how long do these breaths there fast? Give me a couple of giving up on right now and just keep doing that for 15 minutes and you can alternate it. You can alternate doing like little short ones like you know, but basically putting out a massive amount of breath and then it's also, it's best to do this with somebody they're leading because it does create, you get really kind of a. it's a weird state. You're being, you're actually really generating a psychedelic state so we get in there 15 minutes and it was cool. It's not like the dmt experience which has this what they call the chrysanthemum have all these colors and for Texas and lights and the flotillas then I'll all the shit I've previously described, but it's very focused like the vision that you get.

Speaker 4:          00:26:19       And I had a whole, me personally, I had like a whole background that kind of came in. It was kind of like a seamless eternal background. Three hundred and 60 degrees and then I saw myself come in but I was like faceless and I was looking and let your eyes open or closed. Closed. Closed. Yeah. You can't really see. If you try to open your vision, you're a little dizzy, you're distorted. You've basically hyperventilated the shit out of yourself. So. So when your eyes closed and you're seeing this, and then the most powerful, transformative moment for me was when I actually, for the first time, out of all the medicines I've ever done, I saw a visual depiction of what I believe my God self, my soul, my spirit self was, you know, in the Boga experience. That was my true self. And I heard it talking to me while I was taking the above at.

Speaker 4:          00:27:07       That was the one guiding me through with a blinking cursor going through all the information in my life. That voice, I actually saw it pictured and depicted in the physical form. In that vision, did it look like it didn't, is that safe for your lungs or your brand? So it was developed by a, by this Guy Stanislav Grof. And he developed it when acid became illegal, he's like, we got to create a state that's legal. Now that acid is illegal because that was his favorite. So He created this and they've done quite a bit of study. Um, it felt, it felt, you know, intense, but you felt really strong and good after it was done. So. And I've looked around at some of the studies and a couple of people say it's not good for you, but other people say absolutely no harm and done. So do your research on that. Make sure that you're comfortable with what it's doing to your body

Speaker 2:          00:27:57       about the idea. Why would I. I'm confused as to why it would be bad for you while you're doing this. Breathing heavy. But yeah, it really, you're not adding any kind of size. The same kind of thing is it is to a certain degree, except this is actually temporarily restricting some blood flow. But it's not like, how is it doing that though, by just breathing? Yeah. So some mechanism with the Russian. Yeah. You're going to have to faster, harder in through the nose, out through the mouth. This does not make for a good podcast because this could take like 10 minutes. I could take a while, especially for dropped down to five, but uh, but it manipulates the carbon dioxide level in your blood. You're expelling more carbon dioxide, which raises your Ph level. And by raising your

Speaker 4:          00:28:43       Ph level, it's somehow restricts some of the blood vessels which creates this state. And uh, and really there's, you know, when you start to look at the mechanism of action, a lot of psychedelics, what it's doing is it's shutting off certain portions of the brain and that's what people know. That's where I really appreciate Aldous Huxley's view on this, which is a lot of people think the psychedelic experience is adding something to you. Like adding an experience on. He's saying all you're doing, you're not adding shit. You're taking away your mind and by taking away your mind you allow what's already there to come through. And this is a reliable legal self mechanism for getting there.

Speaker 2:          00:29:22       And it was pretty cool. So I have to say, where does the average person find a guide to do this? Yeah. I would just look at Google, your city, whatever it is all fucked up. You got to be careful guys. Gonna fuck you is gonna. Yes. Shamonic breathing. You've got to breathe through my day. You have to be careful wherever you go. You have. Be careful with Iowasca Maestros. You have to be careful with a bogus shamans. All of these people. It's true. Put them through your shit last.

Speaker 3:          00:29:48       No, you never know because just because someone says they're in a bogus shaman doesn't mean anybody could say that now. I mean anybody could say they're in Iowasca Arrow. You have to find out whether that's unfortunate. That's one of the unfortunate aspects of being able to communicate. We can also lie.

Speaker 2:          00:30:07       It's like a life coach and we're going to say that they're a life coach now. That's ridiculous. She's got a funny life coach story that they tell you.

Speaker 3:          00:30:13       That guy who bangs older rich chicks. No, I did. I mentioned him on the podcast before, but it's like when you're around someone and you just immediately go, oh great, there's a fucking. There was a coyote in the chicken coop and I'm watching all these poor old ladies hang around with this, like super charming man with a ponytail and I want to smack them because I'm like, I know what you're doing. You fuck. And he's hanging out with these older broads and he started out as like a manny, you know, a male nanny. And my friend who lived next door, I was like, that fucking guy away from my wife, man. Like he, like he had a thing about him and this guy's not very jealous. So I was like, hmm, interesting. So then it turns out he starts banging the wife and they get a divorce. And so

Speaker 2:          00:30:57       the husband knew it, the husband leaves,

Speaker 3:          00:31:00       now this guy is banging the wife who's rich of course. And now he becomes a life coach. He's not a male nanny anymore, he's a life coach. And I'm like, this guy is just a straight con man. He's just a straight con man who moved into this neighborhood and started wearing thumb rings,

Speaker 2:          00:31:17       knee high leather boots, and the ponytail, you know, tries to, can only permit yourself one or the other. Really? Yeah. He's one of those

Speaker 3:          00:31:25       sky's where, you know, you'll catch him reading a classic. Oh, it just happened to be reading Kerouac here. Come on in. You know, he's like cultivating this whole image and using it to scam these older ladies. It's really interesting how obvious it is to like, who's she talking to? The Guy, he just oozes bullshit. Button bodies. Thirty six and he's got a cock and you know, these 50 year old women, I can't believe he's banging me and boom, next thing you know, he's a life coach. Life fucking life coach. Got to get your bolt. Bullshit detector out. If I'm strong, hone that in. And ladies, guys with thumb rings. Come on now. Come on now. What is that guy doing with a fucking thumb ring on? Silly Bitch. That's ridiculous. Agreed. Agreed. He's banging you. You're 50 and he's got a thumb ring. Rod,

Speaker 2:          00:32:16       ponytail. Run. Yeah, ponytail. That Paul Rudd movie about Elysium. And what was that one about? What? There's this Paul Rudd movie that was kind of a bit of a spoof on a, on like a commune where everything was super spiritual guy, but I saw the ads for the last wanderlust is the name of it. Yeah, main guy. It was pretty funny. Yeah, there's some super funny

Speaker 4:          00:32:40       part was that movie vanished. I didn't have a fucking God damn. It wasn't. It wasn't great, but it was okay, but they have a guy like that ponytail, thumb rings, plays the guitar really soft, and then he ends up trying to fuck polaroids girlfriend

Speaker 1:          00:32:51       course. Of course. That's what those guys do. I know another guy who will remain, remain nameless police, very shamanistic in nature and really trying to just bank chicks, but there are good ones. There are good ones. Well for sure. The experience is, you know, I had a conversation with David Cho about this yesterday where I said that if you took dmt or silicide been or whatever and someone said to you, did you just go to [inaudible] dot com and we're gonna get off, get off that. Look at these messages. I don't want to see the messages, man. If you, you know, a lot of people like look at any sort of a psychedelic experience and they say, Oh, you're hallucinating, you're just hallucinating. But my take on it is kind of whether or not it's real. Whether or not you could take it and put it in a bag and put a zip lock on it and set it on a scale and measure it your or whether or not it's illumination.

Speaker 1:          00:33:47       The exact same experience happened. Whether you think that you are in another dimension communicating with intelligent entities or these chemicals are fucking with your cerebral cortex and forcing your visual input to get fuck sideways by all this additional shit that's not supposed to be there and so you have hallucinations. Either way, the same thing is happening to you. If you took magic fairy dust and were transported into an impossible, strange land where the sky was filled with everchanging geometric patterns that are made out of love and understanding and they're coming down to you and telling you everything that you already know about yourself and telling you that they love you or you're hallucinating. Isn't in the same thing happening. The same thing is happening to your eyes. The same thing is happening to your brain and the same thing is happening. For you to sit back and to sort of interpret and try to incorporate into your view of the world, the same exact thing, whether it's real or not, so we get caught up in this idea of what's real, what is real? Is that real? Because I can hit it with a hammer and is the air real because I can't even touch that. It's like, can we measure it with modern sources? If we can, then it's real. I say, that's crazy.

Speaker 4:          00:35:05       Yeah, I agree and you know the. I've been looking at a lot of toltec philosophy over recently and they just dispose of that problem entirely. They call our whole experience the dream and it's a. it's a cocreated dream by everybody. They just call it the dream. The total is what they call it and what they say is the most important thing is not the dream itself, but how that dream interacts with us. It's a completely subjective reality. If you already think of everything as a dream, then you stop asking these silly questions about whether the mushrooms are doing this so that it's about your experience them. It's about how that translates to what you're going to be, how you're able to see the world better, how you're able to find a deeper awareness, how you're able to in what their worldview is. Be the warrior hunter that hunts what they call the parasite inside themselves. Same thing that Steven pressfield calls resistance. They call the parasite hunt. That part of yourself that self sabotaging, that's fearful and and that's what they say is the most important, is getting yourself to those states where you're aware and you can interact with the dream on your terms, set your intent, use your powerful belief to make the dream a dream of heaven instead of a dream of hell,

Speaker 3:          00:36:16       and the idea that your gonna fall into some sort of a situation where if you have a psychedelic experience and it fucks your head up, that maybe you're not going to be able to come back and maybe you're going to go crazy. That that's a real possibility and that's something that people need to consider before they fuck around with anything. If you have a hard time with regular reality, don't, don't go doing any drugs. That's when you want to try that shamonic breathing shit. Try to work your way up to that. Totally. Don't just take acid, you know, because if you take acid it will last like a long time and if you're freaking out, like part of psychedelic experiences are the ability to just let go and it's very hard for people to do and one of the big things when you hear people talk about like bad trips, in my experience, one of the big issues is people letting go and letting the experience take them there because you will try to resist it because one of the first things that any psychedelic experience exposes is your own flaws and inadequacies and a lot of people

Speaker 4:          00:37:26       do not. Yeah. I think it was Bob Marley that said it was the mirror that reveals you to yourself. Yeah. A lot of people don't like that. No, because you're creating. You're creating an image that isn't true. Image you want to project is not what's going to appear to you in the mirror. Unless you've done something like this, doesn't have to be a psychedelic experience. A flotation tank can get you that meditation, if done correctly, can get you there, but the psychedelic experience goes with the earth mover and it just takes tons of dirt off of the path. So you see the mirror way quicker to bunker buster. It is exactly. It's just gets right down through. That fucks you up all your mountain of bullshit that you've covered yourself with

Speaker 3:          00:38:05       that. That's what I think leads to a lot of bad trips for people. But you also have to consider brain chemistry. You know, there's some people that need medication. There's some people where their brain's not working so well. And if that's, you don't stack mushrooms on top of that. I would say that that's probably not the best way to go. I think that's important. Whenever we talk about psycho dogs, we're talking about the good aspects of it. But then you hear about like, that dude from pink floyd that lost his marbles, and

Speaker 4:          00:38:32       especially with the synthetics, you know, you'd that seemingly acid and some other different, um, you know, some of the other different Kenneth Chemical Monikers, like a Dr Sasha shogun would create and his lab or something like that. Seems fine though. He is fine now, but he has the right attitude. I think with the right attitude of the, the key is, is to witness and allow. You got to be the person in the movie theater, eating popcorn, watching what's happening, you know, kind of subjectively or objectively. I mean, just like, oh, that's interesting. Oh, snakes eating my organs. Oh yeah, that's interesting. Oh, going down a vine, the thorns and having my genitals eviscerated. Oh, that's unpleasant. But no big deal. That's the attitude you have to take during those horrible things regardless of what it is. Because if you don't, if you try to fight it, it's going to win.

Speaker 4:          00:39:18       Yeah. And it's so easy to develop a strong ego got. Especially if you're a man, it's so easy to take yourself seriously, especially if you've got some accomplishments under your belt and you're working hard every day and you just start thinking you're something special, you know, you really can confuse the fuck out of yourself and then one of those ego obliterating experiences comes along and just exposes you to yourself or what you really are and you're like, Oh wow, who? But I almost always feel when it's over, like wow, I needed that. Yeah, absolutely. So much feel so much lighter. Better now. I can get along quicker now. Yeah. Yeah. I think going back to the archives of my history, I remember one particularly difficult experience. One of the most challenging I had, and I've had A. I've talked a lot about snakes and spiders exploding and all of that.

Speaker 4:          00:40:10       I've always taken with a grain of salt. The one that was the most, most challenging experience I've had was actually a vision of hell, where I felt completely out of any realm where there was life. Like there was not a rock, there was not a tree, there was not another living thing anywhere around and it was the deepest, loneliest, most isolated feeling I've ever felt. And that to me actually calibrated what my experience of hell ever was, is hell is not in these places with demons and fire. There's all life force there. There's the energy of creation and destruction. Hell is being on the other side of space where there is no life where there's no source where there's no nothing there. I mean a rock, a spider, anything would have been a salvation in this place that I was, that I was appearing at and I felt myself at that point trying to fight it like, oh fuck, I gotta get Outta here.

Speaker 4:          00:41:04       Make some butterflies, appear something, please happen. A color, anything. Everything was just drab and dead and I was totally alone. And that experience there, you know, if, if I hadn't been well versed in, in what you know, in this realm, on the other side, then it could have been a really. It could have been an experience that stuck with me. You know? It could have been something that I didn't allow to happen and I fought and I, and if I would have stood up and tried to change my scenery and touch my face and say, Hey,

Speaker 2:          00:41:34       I'm still alive. Hey, I'm still in life. And not actually dealt with that and not seen it all the way through. I had the feeling like that would have been something that would have stuck with me. So psychedelics are not to be taken lightly. I think you need to take the proper steps. Find someone who's experienced, you know, do something like holotropic breathing, you know, do something like an isolate all of trophic holotropic, ours, Germantic. Do something like that. Go to an isolation tank. You know, maybe we try a little weed, you know, make sure that you're cool with, with like the baby steps before you just go whole hog. And if you do go whole hog, there's something to be said for that. Just diving in the cold swimming pool without dipping your toe in. Make sure you're with someone who's just on their game and really on point and can guide you through.

Speaker 2:          00:42:16       And you can look at them. One of the most important things is to look at them and be like, Hey, I'm not going to die. Right? And sometimes you just need it to be like, yeah, you're good. And that's all you need. Like, Hey, I didn't accidentally poison myself because your brain will tell you if you're doing it alone and you get to a bad place, it's going to say, I think you might've just boys and yourself, dude, you didn't mind it. Just boys and yourself. And you don't want that voice. Especially when you're starting out. That's what it feels like mean. Do DMT. You feel like there's no way I'm coming back. Fucked up, fucked up. Yeah. I crossed into the great beyond to take a peek and they're going to let me back. It's. It's really sad that from what we know about the positive benefits of a lot of these substances, that we are forced to do it this way.

Speaker 2:          00:43:01       We're forced to. We were under the illusion that we live in a free society because it's freer than most societies, but it's still not a free society. The human race has yet to conceive of an execute a free society. It doesn't exist as far especially a free, educated, aware society that is not beholden to evil corporations. We haven't figured that out yet. We really haven't, and that's why we make movies about it, like Avatar and they become wildly popular. Oh yeah. That's the closest we can come to is our own imaginations. He, yeah, there's some, I don't know. There's a lot of people believe that you're going to have to cert have a certain amount of Yang in order to have a certain amount of yen and it's almost like this sort of evil against good is like what the human being needs to sort of propel society forward.

Speaker 2:          00:43:57       Constant struggle and conflict, which creates momentum. I don't necessarily agree with that, but it seems to be that a lot of people are lazy as fuck and if they lived in paradise, they wouldn't get laptops made. You know? It's almost like you need some. It's, it all has to be difficult for us to push further, you know, but there's enough difficulty in our own minds just getting within ourselves. Finding happiness and self love and actualization is a fucking battle already, so to say that we need this external shit just to allow us to do that is not true. There's always gonna be a struggle. I'm not saying

Speaker 3:          00:44:32       that we need you and I certainly don't need it, but society as a whole, if I looked at the human race as a mathematical computation and I looked at the amount of energy that's been expressed and the amount of effort that's been expressed and a little, why are they spending so much energy? Why they're spending so much effort? Well, they're doing it because it's trying to conquer the world junior because of trying to expose. They're trying to enforce the ape ideology on this ever changing technological world they live and that's why they're expressing themselves in these 16 hour work days. It's really that simple. I mean why? Why are they in debt? Why they owe so much money? Why do they, why do they work more than their health, let's them like what do they do in there? Well, they have to because they owe money.

Speaker 3:          00:45:14       Credit cards because they had to pay for fucking electronics that they need to keep the machine alive. Like if you looked at a completely objective outside of being a person outside of being a cog in this wheel and you looked at it from like, you know, an objective distance, you'd would say, oh, I see they're fucking building towards something and they're there in a fury. They're in a frenzy to the point where they give up their own health and happiness in order to perpetuate this process. They're either building something over there at the height of madness, you know, to a certain degree and could be that this height of madness. The whole reason why it coexists with this incredible, restrict him restriction on psychedelics and restriction on the public's access to psychedelics that they. They coexist because without one you could not have the other.

Speaker 3:          00:46:07       If if psychedelics were not illegal and incredibly difficult to come by, we would not live in the same world. We would be connected with the whole world, would realize that we are all. We are completely necessary to each other and that that vision that you had of ultimate space and silence and no color and drabness and being being hellacious because even though we have these instincts in this ego that wants us to go out there and make our name for ourselves, the reality is you are not shit without other people. You cannot you if you're alone. It's for breaks. We take breaks and you breathe and you get something to eat and watch tv by yourself and you go. That was nice, but you better get back to the people soon because if you don't, you're fucked. It's like I don't. Some days I don't eat.

Speaker 3:          00:46:53       I take a day off eating. If I feel like taking a day off, eating, it's good for you, but I don't take more than one. You know I don't take a month off. You know what I'm saying? Like that's not good and a staple of being a human being is human beings. You have to interact with human beings. We're, we're, we're most certainly a part of a process. The question is, is this process being run in a conscious manner or is it being run and instinctive manner that's been hijacked because the very instincts that we have, which we're sort of regulated by psychedelic compounds throughout our history, and we removed those compounds from the equation which accelerates the madness aspect of the human without the bio chemical and botanical sort of mediating age that's unbalanced.

Speaker 4:          00:47:42       I think a lot of things had been hijacked. I think religion has been one of the main things that has been hijacked. It is taken our desire to connect with source, with life, with God. If your vocabulary permits, you know, there's a big vocab issue, this whole thing, whatever you want to call it, that force that creates life within all of us, call it God, call it whatever you want, but there is a natural inclination that, drawing towards that, I think there's a, there's an old myth between, uh, a Hindu myth and it says, you know, Brahma and Maya were the only two forces out there in the universe and they were bored. And so mine. I said, okay, we're going to create a game. I was a female, Brahma is the male. Dad would not let any of them have sex at that point anyways, but she says we're going to have a game and the and is like, okay, we'll do that.

Speaker 4:          00:48:25       It's like first you create the world. Brahma creates the world. Then after Brahma creates the world, she says, okay, now you have to create someone who can appreciate the world and says, okay, so he creates humans and then at that point she cuts them up into all tiny little tiny pieces and he puts a little piece in each human and says, Brahma, now the game begins. The game is you are going to all think you're different and you're going to have to find your way back to figuring out who you are and so that, that idea that we're all like a little piece of something still just trying to figure it out. That instinct, that impetus to, you know, to find what we are at the very core, when you remove the body, remove the mind, get back to the soul and even remove the soul.

Speaker 4:          00:49:08       So you're just that piece of life force. You know that desire to figure out what that is has been jacked just jacked by Christianity, Islam, Judaism, which had as a sentiment of truth, a kernel of goodness and wisdom. All of these things, Islam included, everything has this kernel of wisdom and value, but then it gets hijacked by people for power. You know, people who have been frustrated, people who are sadistic, people who want to control other people want the money, want the sex. They're like the Tony Montana in a fucking priest robe, you know, they jack this stuff leaders to control the people and and it's created this massive imbalance. I think it's maybe not created it, but it certainly accelerated it and then of course the forces of greed that have been kind of a inculcated by general society and this feeling that you need more things and in all of this, this is all just fueled to create really a massive imbalance. In my opinion. It did need to be this massive, but there is going to be a massive correction. I just hope we don't go too far back the other way because there is a need for balance. There is a need for, you know, in my opinion, strength and capitalism and many of the ideals that we actually do pretty well. Um, but you know, if you go all the way completely back the other side, which is a little bit probably why the movement in the sixties and seventies failed. It was too loose,

Speaker 3:          00:50:28       didn't have enough structure, didn't have enough of the, of the, you know, the Yang part of it. It just went to yen. And the problem with creating these big imbalances as the pendulum swing gets too broad. Yeah. Um, that, that, that is a really good point, man. The pendulum swing and it's, uh, it's fascinating how every time a person gets into a position of power, there's a corruption and, uh, a deviation from the original intent and it becomes this, this sort of dominance issue. Like even with Obama, Obama has. Look, he came from, if you look at his past, he came from a single mother, uh, he's mixed race. You look at them, you say, well, this guy should understand the plight of the common folk. This guy should be, you know, someone who represents us because he grew up Kinda poor, you know, he wasn't a rich kid, but then he gets into office and he's been the one guy who's attacked whistleblowers more than any president before.

Speaker 3:          00:51:32       He's gone after the press more than any president before. They've dropped more bombs from drones than any president before. So was he for his, for a lack of privacy. He's for infringement on your rights. He's for restricting constitutional liberty. He's for changing constitutional and uh, the, the, uh, amendments that have given us freedoms in this country and restricting them to keep you safe. All the shit that we've been warned about by like our founding fathers, he who would take freed, he who would take safety over liberty deserves neither. You know, that's like an old school saying and this idea that they're going to take liberty away from you to protect you. The drones and it's fucking Obama Obama's doing this. Remember that guy that got into Egypt and you know, they were like, well, you know Egypt throughout that, that asshole dictator, and as soon as this new guy gets in, he tries to pass all these laws to turn himself into a dictator and you're like Jesus Christ and this riots in the street like, what the fuck did we fight for?

Speaker 3:          00:52:32       What is going on and what is exactly what exactly is executive privilege? What the fuck are you talking about? You mean you don't have to tell us that you knew about some crazy program where they sold guns to Mexican drug lords. Thousands of guns and those guns were used on Americans, civilians, American citizens. So the border patrol agent was murdered with one of those guns. This operation fast and furious and Obama says, well, I'm just going to take executive privilege. I don't really have to talk about that like crazy. And I'm not saying he's guilty and I'm not saying that as a president, he could possibly be aware of everything that's going on because I don't think you can. But the fact that we have some creepy get out of jail free pass because that seems like some shit that might put you in jail for what you would want from your movie hero president is to say, hey, this is bullshit. I'm going to take executive privilege.

Speaker 4:          00:53:26       The people need to know about this. This was some whack system that we had in the government. It's going to change. But no, they don't do that, you know. And in every instance they kind of push things under, just wait for people to get lazy, you know, whether it's the president or whether it's the UN. I just watched a great documentary called you and me like you for United Nations. Me, uh, it's by this Guy Ami Horowitz. And some of the things we're talking about there in the Rwanda crisis was unbelievable. So basically they had the UN, which is a heavily armed force in the area, can really regulate shit if they wanted to. They got all the machine guns, they got tanks, they've got whatever intelligence from one of the top kernels. Kim's back to the UN and says, Hey, the Hutus are about to exterminate the Tutsis.

Speaker 4:          00:54:10       We have the plan, we have the leaders of the Hutus, we can take them down, we can take them out now and prevent a mass genocide. And this was like a week in advance, sending the cable, send it. Can't. Can we do this? Can we do this? Can we stop this genocide please? These are the leaders. They're are going to get this message out. Can we stop? Can we stop? No. No answer. No a better stay impartial. Better stay impartial. Well, what happens exactly what the colonel said happens. The Hutus go in, they get their hammers, they get their machetes and they just run riot. Everybody with a tootsie identification card, whacked, right? So eventually all of the Tutsis gather at the UN, puts up a flag and this school posts the perimeter and there's hundreds and hundreds of of Tutsis that have gathered in this, in this building and they're safe for temporarily as the UN is there protecting them.

Speaker 4:          00:54:56       And then what happens? So the Hutus go around and they start drinking and they have their bloody hammers fresh on their, their kinsmen blood out there and they're just drinking in Taunton and hanging out outside the perimeter. The UN says, you know, what do we do? What do we got to do? And the message comes back in from the UN, evacuate the premises, evacuated the parents, and they're like, if we do that, there's 500 people that are going to get killed with hammers. You realize that. They're like, yeah, we can't. We can't take sides. Evacuate the premises. And as they're evacuating the premises, you see this footage. They're like hanging on. They're hanging onto the tank, please take me there asking them, shoot me, please shoot me so I don't have to deal with what the people with the hammers and the machetes and the rape that's going to happen.

Speaker 4:          00:55:39       If you evacuate us and you leave us right now, what happens to soldiers? Beat them off with the end of their guns crews out and exactly that happens. They roll into the school mass murder, mass genocide. Why aren't we more upset about that? That is ridiculous. What the hell is the UN doing if they're not there to protect those people in that circumstance, you know, and that's just an example of, you know, we pick on our own government all the time. Sure we have some certain involvement in the UN, but the UN doesn't seem any better and it makes sense that, you know, probably hardly any other government is better. We're just more active. Somehow. This system that has created people in power has created a morality where all they care

Speaker 3:          00:56:23       about is power and money and that's got to change. And how do you get that to change without enlightening people? And how do you enlightened people, you know, I mean you can't get them to just breathe, come on, do it, and we'll get you to shut up. Shamonic breathing. Everybody sit down. You got to force them to do Shimano breathing. They need the, they need the bunker busters. It's a fascinating situation because we are in this really odd time where we can learn so much and there's so much information available almost instantaneously, but yet we still are struggling with these crazy ape dominance instincts and these eight dominance instincts sort of get subverted in these large civilization contexts of one person or multiple people controlling millions and having to keep a lid on this bubbling cauldron of humanity that you can call a country and they almost all do the same thing.

Speaker 3:          00:57:20       They just. It's a fucking power grab. They try to protect themselves as much as possible. They tried to take away your rights, especially you're right to go after them. You're right to defend yourself. They want to take away your guns. They want to take away anything that makes you crazy. They want to take anything that's going to empower you and and somehow or another take away from their ability to control you. It's like, no, no. Society really wants to give people equal access to information. No society really wanted the Internet. They just fucked up and it would. It sort of snuck up on them and now they're stuck in the situation where they're trying to. They're trying to regulate and trying to sort of govern people the way they did three, four decades ago, which is a blink of an eye in terms of culture, but in terms of this society, it's a million years ago because of the Internet, so it looks so woefully inadequate today.

Speaker 3:          00:58:16       It looks so clumsy and it's so obviously corrupt. Like I would say that this civil, this culture that's growing up right now, this generation knows more about the fact that our government is corrupt and how it's corrupt more than any generation before. Absolutely. Like by a long stretch, long shot. There's things that we know about today. You know, when Jimmy, even things that were in the news, like the Iran Contra affair. I mean I remember that was when I was in my early twenties. He seen Oliver North on TV and trying to piece this together and trying to figure out. Wait, wait, wait, why? Hold on. What'd you guys do? The visa. You guys sold arms to Iran. What are you doing? Like what? The fuck is going on. And you did what you, the contras and the Sandinistas. What'd you do? You so coke in the ghetto. You guys sold coke to pay for guns. Whoa. Like what kind of government are we run in? Yeah, and I, I think so, you know, to go back to your question, how do we fix it? And I, I think the only way is we have to create a pandemic, an

Speaker 4:          00:59:22       epidemic like influenza used to be or the black plague used to be, but on the good side of pandemic of consciousness. And I think that's one of the beautiful things about your show here is that we're creating a bit of that momentum. We're catching people and then these ideas, they're contagious, you know, that's why you call it spreading virally the whole term from the Internet. It can be like a virus, truth, consciousness, awareness can spread and we're all an active part of spreading that. Each person that we bring in and say, Hey, have you seen this? You know, I remember one of the things I was, you know I showed a video about nda is just for an example that indefinite detention to somebody who was mild,

Speaker 1:          01:00:01       I don't know what that is, a national defense authorization act, which is a really scary act, has been passed recently, which has all sorts of things in there that eviscerate the bill of rights. One of them is indefinite detention where they can take someone who's an American citizen. Then they suspect them something and they can just attain them. They don't have to have a lawyer, they don't have to. Like you don't have any rights, you don't have any rights anymore. It's basically just like the king throwing you in the dungeon. Yep. And this is real shit that our politicians have passed. We've been hijacked

Speaker 4:          01:00:28       essentially. So I showed this video to someone who is mildly pro Obama, not crazy, really kind of APP. Took herself out of the old political picture and I was like, listen, this is a bill that he allowed to pass and showed her all the details about it. Basically it was a video describing exactly what you said and, and going through it in about a two minute video, she's like, oh my God, really? Whoa. You know, and at that moment you could see there was a shift there, you know, she understood something that wasn't she wasn't aware of. And every time that happens, you know, we make those little marks. It starts to spread virally. And at certain point I believe that it will get to a critical mass where the people just will no longer tolerate it and will be the majority. And at that point we'll have to clean house and they're gonna clean.

Speaker 4:          01:01:13       You know, the old power structure is going to clean. They're going to come up with some really crazy fucked up rules. And I think at the height of it, unfortunately there's going to be conflict. I think it's inevitable. I don't know what that's going to be, but it's gonna get really nasty when the movement of consciousness runs square against the kind of Reptilian power grab of the old structure. And that's going to be a trying time. But I think they'll die off or they'll die off smoothly, pull in their place that's possible. And hopefully that's the best case, the best. That's the way we want it to be. The way want it

Speaker 1:          01:01:44       to be is that the young people coming up now, the ones that are in college right now, the people that are listening to this, when they're riding their bike to school here, the ones that are gonna be responsible for running this fucking crazy machine in the future. If, if the whole world is aware what the fuck is going on, it's harder and harder to fuck people. It's just harder. And I think right now they're still able to lock down enough that they can operate in the old way. And when you see things like the, the NSA's idea of building this we, Abby Martin and um, uh, what's her name was the other gal?

Speaker 3:          01:02:20       Well David Seaman, it was his thing as well. We had him on and he was explaining to us what, what they're trying to do that there. They're building this gigantic compound in Utah, which essentially copies every email that every American citizen makes. Every phone call that you make is recorded. Every picture that you text someone, so all your Dick Pics, all those are going to be recording so that if they ever have anything that they have to bring out an Abra. Marcus, what are you doing? I'm in Florida and did you, you know, whatever. Did you fucking burn the American flag? You like, what are you talking about? Like, well we have here your emails that say that you were on your way to Florida burn the flag. We have. You get a flag he bought at Walmart because we traced your credit card. We have here.

Speaker 3:          01:03:09       You know the phone calls he made bragging about it. You want us to play them back for you and you're like, what? And you realize like, my whole life is being recorded and every email I make I have to assume now that someone's listening and reading my emails, listening to my phone calls and reading my emails. Who are these people and what? Because they get elected, do they even get elected? I mean, when you're in the NSA, do you get elected to just get hired so you get hired so you get hired and you get to be the one who decides whether or not they can look at your Dick Pics, like what? What kind of a world we live in, in where some small group of people have that kind of power with the rest of us. I can't. If someone hacks into your email, those are those people can go to jail.

Speaker 3:          01:03:50       Okay. If a regular person, some if Brian gets nutty and he decides to hack into some girl's email and starts reading her emails that she could find out about that and she could have him arrested and he can go to jail. You can do like cyber terrorism. You could do time for that, but if the NSA says it's okay and that's your Gig and you press that button which says, record all our micro markets as emails. That somehow is okay. That that's insanity, that that is the height of insanity. We're not talking about criminals here. Ladies and gentlemen, we're talking about the entire population of the United States. Wrap your head around that, you know, innocent until proven guilty. Yeah. Not so much. The idea is they're going to record all of your shit, but don't worry, they won't send your Dick pics out as long as you keep it.

Speaker 4:          01:04:43       Now imagine a scenario where what makes this particularly vial is the fact that there's so many unjust laws. I mean, if every law was perfectly just and based upon harming somebody else, then it would be like, yeah, what are they going to fucking catch me for? You know, whatever it's going to be like the only people who would get caught with the murderers, rapists, people like that. But because there's so many unjust bullshit laws like these laws around your own, you know, personal freedoms, like whether you want sexual freedoms, um, you know, what you ingest in your body, what kind of, you know, whether you want to smoke weed or whether you wanted whatever. All of these unjust laws give them so much more leveraged. It's like the church saying that, you know, masturbating and sex is a sin. Well guess what? You got a whole bunch of fucking centers then and then once you have sinners then you can manipulate them with guilt, you know, and then you can manipulate them with absolution and you can control them. But if they didn't do that, if the church was like, yeah, you just have to be a good person and try your best and you're not a sinner, you know, it'd be like, oh sweet, I qualify. So the lighter church and they'll put the bullshit of the cycle of evil and this is where it gets really screwy is that there's a good percentage of our prisons that are private, which means they're businesses that profit fit

Speaker 1:          01:06:00       off of people being in jail. And so they and the prison guard unions lobby to make sure that there's more laws that they can use to lock you up and fill their prisons to make money. So it is essentially legalized slavery. And there's a lot of those laws, especially when it comes to the drug laws that absolutely make no fucking sense. They're not based on science. They're not based on what we know about the human body in 2013, especially like marijuana laws and no ways that based on anything rational in in any way, shape or form yet it's still federal law and they can take you and throw you in there magic box where you make them money and they want to do that and that's legal. That's. That's a strange thing. That is a very strange thing to be operating like that in 2013 that people are making money off of locking people up.

Speaker 1:          01:07:00       Some of like the guy in Montana, there's a famous story of a gentleman who was in jail because he had guns as well as medical marijuana and they pass some new things saying that if you have guns and you're, you know, you're involved in marijuana, it makes it way worse because then it makes you like a crazy drug dealer. Like you're one of those Mexican narco was a hold up in Humboldt with fucking machine guns and shit. But no. This is a guy that was like a hunter who also decided to run a medical marijuana farm because he was trying to make money because he thought that it was the law. He had these local politicians, local cops come over and inspect his plant, like everything looks good and he's like, here's the list of people that I'm selling to these. These plants are all dedicated to them.

Speaker 1:          01:07:43       This one goes to this person, this is a, this is their medicine. And um, um, I'm a farmer and I'm going to be able to feed my family and make a living doing that. Now that you guys up for a possible, they might lock him up, Jeff, or 80 years. No, that's, that's great. For what? For. Is it because he's shooting? People have. No, no, no, no, no. Is it because he's a felon? He's not supposed to have guns because he's been shown abroad people. Oh, no, no, no, no. It's just a farmer. Okay. Is it because he's hurting somebody? What is the easy growing something that's bad? Oh, no, no, no. He's just growing medicine. That's state approved medicine. So they can put this guy

Speaker 3:          01:08:16       in jail for essentially a non crime first in the state. It's come. Everything he did is completely legal. His use of firearms is recreational and for hunting purposes, like this guy's not a narco terrorists, but yet they can use all these bullshit laws and arrested, probably confiscated a lot of material that they took it all. It's always we'd his money too. They come in and Jack your money and your weed and what they do in California, it's kind of cute is because Obama said that he's not going to target anybody who breaks. Only the state law said is if they break both state and federal law, then we're going to come after him or rather not federal offense because it's all federally illegal. So he said if they're, if they break the state law as well as the federal law than uh, then they're open for press is when he first said when he got into office.

Speaker 3:          01:09:04       So this is what they do. This is how cute they are. So they don't really put you in jail. A lot of the times what they do is they arrest you, they open up the place, they come in with guns, they scare the fuck out anybody, they take all of your weed and then they take all your money. They take everybody's information down and they do nothing, so it's the jacket jacket that's a jack, so instead of arresting you and prosecuting you and putting you in jail instead of doing that, what they're doing more often is just taking all your shit and then saying the case is open and they never do anything about it because they really don't have the resources to prosecuting these cases. They really don't have resources to go after all these guys that are running these medical marijuana shops because there's twice as many of them as there are.

Speaker 3:          01:09:46       Starbucks. I mean the, the, the numbers of medical marijuana clinics in southern California is somewhere in the thousands. They don't even know how many dispensaries rather. They don't even know how many they have. There are. They're everywhere. Fucking things and some of them are operating illegally, but they don't give a shit if they come in. They take all your stuff and they take all your money and some people you know, do a little time here and there, but for the most part for like really egregious things, we'll do a little time here and there for most parts. Jacking. Yeah. You know, it's for people who, you know, aren't sympathetic to the marijuana cause, which I don't know if anybody listening to this show isn't sympathetic to that cause, but presuming there were, you can take the cars out to the Ra, the whole raw milk.

Speaker 3:          01:10:27       You know, you can take that out too. That I watched a documentary called farmagedden. Same thing, gunned know agents with guns going in, locking up yogurt, freezers, yogurt, freezers, and then jacking these farms. There's like little farms they're selling to people. You got these kids saying, oh my asthma was way better when I was drinking the whole milk. Raw milk is. It's obviously way better for you all. I'll a lot of this lactose intolerance and stuff. It's because of the way that they homogenized, pasteurized and processed the milk, which is great if you're dealing with a city and you have to store milk for weeks in advance. It is certainly more healthy than getting people raw milk that goes bad. Then everybody gets sick and that can happen too. So I see why it was invented. But the idea someone could have a source where they could be. They could get raw milk and they can get it from a farm and that farm sells it to the supermarket. You know, it's all safe and fresh. It's dated, it's all good, but that's illegal. That. And not only that, they'll arrest you with guns. Guns drawn.

Speaker 4:          01:11:29       Yeah. I guess what would happen though, if the government didn't come in and regulate that, well, you know, consumers would start to look for, hey, do I want this milk or do I want this milk? And you start to identify brands or there'd be consumer watchdog services that came up and said, hey, these milks are good. These milks or sketch, you know, don't drink these milks and the system would self correct itself and instead of locking people up, it taking away whole stashes of yogurt.

Speaker 3:          01:11:56       Sandwiches work. Yeah. And what? Where's the system in effect for the pharmaceutical industry? How many fucking people drop dead every year for Oxycontin's and what? Why aren't they beating down their door with guns and trying to figure out what the fuck's going on here? No, no. Then the too busy arresting farmers for bad yogurt, right? God dammit. And by bad yogurt we mean good yogurt. Yeah, by Delicious Yogurt. It's a strange thing man. We have a strange world and it's a, it's, it's, it's all going through a growth phase. It's like a 16 year old is throwing temper tantrums because they about to become a grownup and they're not quite there yet, but they're fucking think they are. I'll fucking tell you bitch, you know, and they get crazy. It's, it's real weird. It's really weird to be a part of.

Speaker 4:          01:12:40       And you know, the fact that you have the government telling you what is good for you and what is not good for you. It kind of removes people's responsibility to take the onus on themselves to say, Hey, I'm going to go out and procure what's good for my body. A lot of people just blindly trust like, oh yeah, the FDA says it's good. Oh yeah, yeah, that's good. It's FDA approved

Speaker 3:          01:12:59       one source than a government resource at this point in time. There should be, instead of a government resources should be consumer based resources that are more effective because they're motivated by something other than just having a job. It's something they have a passion in what I don't believe in. Whenever you have a government agency like that and like God who gets that job is, I mean, are you sure that that guy is really fucking into making sure that yogurt safe or is he just some asshole with a job? You know? And

Speaker 4:          01:13:25       you never know. And it could be even good people in that system. They have to enforce bad laws. These people in all of these organizations, they could very well be good people and you hear stories of them just saying, look, I just couldn't take it anymore. You know, I'm having to enforce bad laws that come in with a positive ideal in every one of these bodies, but just the system is designed to force them to enforce messed up laws and that's, that creates a problem. But, but going back to what I was saying that, you know, when someone's telling you what to do, you don't take that onus on yourself. I think it's really. They think everybody thinks that it's really helping people, but ultimately the only person that can decide what is good or bad for you. You know, the only person that decide what's good for Joe Rogan, Joe Rogan, you know, you got to do the research, got to figure it out and figure out what's good for your body.

Speaker 4:          01:14:15       You know, you are a really cool analogy that I just recently heard. You know, we have millions of different cells in our body. We all know that and if you think of those cells is individual life forms. Then we have millions of lifeforms that are under our control and doing our bidding. Thank Leslie. They just go to work everyday and do what they're supposed to do for us and we are like their God. We are their rulers. We control their life and death. We can make their life difficult or we can make their life good. We have feeding. I'm shit. We are the gods of our body and you can almost say they work so hard and so well for us that they could almost say they pray to us, you know, whatever analogy you want to use, they're there for us and what do we do for. Yeah, exactly. The coffee's probably not nearly the bad thing that we do to them, but yeah, that makes it. That makes an impact. Cigarettes. Cigarettes should the bad processed foods that you get. No Green, no vegetables. We come from the earth. We got to put a little bit of that back. Know, put some real fuel back in there.

Speaker 3:          01:15:16       It's one of the things that people neglect more than anything. The nutrition and health and exercise. I mean, I've obviously, I've had intelligent friends that laugh that mock me for working out, you know, they think it's beneath them. I'm like, okay, by being lazy, you're, you're limiting the quality of your life and you think that that's smart. I think he's just being lazy and you just sort of justifying it with this like, you know, silly attitude. The silly hipster like attitude. There's nothing would ever gives a shit. You can do it anyway, you know, that kind of. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          01:15:48       To live like that or they discredit the value of it, but it's not just about physicality. It's about what that does for your mind. Yes. The confidence in certain situations, the ability to have that, to take care of yourself as a man, as a woman, as a human being, you know, if it messes, it changes your mental dynamic.

Speaker 3:          01:16:09       He certainly does and I, I also think that your mind functions better. I mean, you can have a really brilliant person that doesn't take care of their body, but man, would they be even more brilliant if they did take care of their body? I think they would. I think the amount of emphasis that you put on your mental function can be delayed or retarded by the fact that your body's not keeping up or that your body's sending shitty signals so your body's tired all the time he bought. He needs naps all the time. Your body is breaking down. It's always getting sick. It's always that that derails the quality of your thinking. Totally. Unquestionably, and having excess stress in your mind rose, the quality of your thinking as well, because you, you're, you're quicker to pull the trigger. You quicker to yell. You're quicker to be upset about things. You're. You're not in control of your vehicle. Right? Silly pitches, right? Yeah. People need martial arts band. That's what I say. I say we need to teach them in fucking school. I think kids, every kid in school, it should be something learn like English.

Speaker 2:          01:17:10       You should learn martial arts and it should be in grade school, Middle School, high school, College. I really think so. I think there would be way less, way less. I think the. It's, it's one of those weird things where people think that it would create bullies, but I think it would be just the opposite. The opposite. Yeah. The discipline, self respect to get. And if you're doing something like Jujitsu now, pure striking stools can create some massive egos. We've seen that, but you know something like you did, so it's very difficult to create a massive, disproportionate ego in that, you know, unless there's some cases where someone's just so good that they just beat everybody and then they get to be a dick. I guess. Especially if it's like one of those kids that grows up quicker than the other kids are like super fast twitch muscle fibers.

Speaker 2:          01:17:53       Yeah, that's possible too. But I think man, it would cut down on so much if more people had that kind of a discipline in your life. We're trying to fix the world. Somebody. I had somebody on the podcast once and we were talking about kettlebells, battle ropes, shit like that, and the guy goes, are you making a fucking army? Like what's going on here, man? He'd getting people to work out and take vitamins and shit, and then you. Then you tell them the propaganda's bullshit and they need to go on. No, we're not making it an army, but you can make your own army. You could follow our advice, make your own shit. I'm on fucking army. No time for that. Can't even say that. You say you're making an army. The NSA light goes off, blue light goes off. We're creating consciousness. We're creating a consciousness epidemic.

Speaker 2:          01:18:35       It's going to be like the. I Dunno, I don't know what color his left in these plagues. So that's the thing. That's a funny thing. I was just thinking about. You have these analogies of horrible destructive things happening on a large scale, but what's like the nuclear bomb of goodness, like nothing exists. Blowjobs in the nuclear bomb. Oh goodness. All right. It's all a gift. Yes. You're not giving anything back just coming to you, but it only happens on a one on one basis. It would need to be a massive 500,000 person at a time blow job and if there was something they could do that, that would become the analogy. Do you think that this shamonic breathing thing is something that could be taught? Like in classes like yoga classes, we can get a bunch of people to experiencing it together? I do. I think if people were willing to explore, I think you'd have to stay.

Speaker 2:          01:19:29       I think that's one method. I think isolation tanks or another method. I think a lot of these methods need to be explored and proliferated throughout. You know, throughout our consciousness as a tool, you know, it needs to be taught like, hey, you want to get back in touch with something that's a little more real, that's a little bit deeper in yourself. That's not clouded by all of the voices of the dream is the toltec say, or our emotions and our needs and our wants and when all this crap that's going on in our head, you want to tap into something a little deeper, a little more real, a little more connected to your fellow life. You know, this is one method. This is another method, you know, and then, hey, maybe for

Speaker 4:          01:20:08       some of you, here's some other things that totally obviously you know, we believe should be legal like mushrooms and then get it down to a science where you know exactly how much, what your dose is. Maybe go on a stale, get your, get your accurate biometrics combined science with shamanism to create reproducible results and an experience that's not clinical but not entirely just on the fringe of spirituality as well, and I think you could really affect people's consciousness doing it in that way.

Speaker 1:          01:20:38       What's the laws on sending people down to Peru or Brazil or to do Iowaska ceremonies? I think

Speaker 4:          01:20:47       far as I understand it, you abide by the laws of the country that you're in. You know their federal. There's no

Speaker 1:          01:20:53       federal jurisdiction. True anymore. I think there's been new regulations that have been passed that say that if you do illegal things and other countries that you can be prosecuted farm here in America. And I think. Yeah. Yeah. And I think the idea behind that, I think that what the use was pedophilia. I think it was one of the things that they use to sort of sneak that thought go into Thailand, which I agree with 100 percent. Not that I agree with pedophilia. That's not what I said. You Fox. What I, what I said was that I agree that yeah, you should prosecute people for doing that. Prosecute people that are doing that anywhere. It doesn't matter if it's legal or not, that's a fucking crime on humanity, but the fact that, uh, you, you, they might be able to use that against. You never heard of a case of that actually coming. Yeah, that's the problem. It's like the laws that are in place, you know, especially with the NDA, there's no been no cases of that either and you can't really

Speaker 4:          01:21:45       be prosecuted for doing a past substance either. So it would be really tricky to try and prosecute someone past substance, like saying like if someone says, if someone says, yeah, I did acid, you know, a year ago, you know, that is not prosecutable.

Speaker 1:          01:22:00       Dan would be fucked. Well No, only yeah, right. From then before the. I think there would have to be grandfathered in. Right? Yeah. Because it'd be interesting this new law, like if you went there now and they found out that you did marijuana and Amsterdam month ago, would they be able to prosecute you? I don't think so. Someone knocking on the door and if so why are you answering it?

Speaker 4:          01:22:25       Don't answer that Shit. I would say that, uh, I would say that you can't get prosecuted. I would hate to, you know, I would hate to deter people from going on these journeys and expeditions with that fear of mine. I just, whether the laws they're not. I think practically it's a, I haven't heard of a case of it, but I'd like to explore that and see it.

Speaker 1:          01:22:44       Sure. That the real issue would be like say if we decided to create some sort of a counseling service, we sit down with people and the decide whether or not they're crazy or undercover cops and then allow them to sign up and go to Brazil.

Speaker 4:          01:22:59       There's a, there's people who do that already to a certain degree. Um, I don't know. They haven't got, they haven't been fucked with as far as the ones that I know or anybody that I've heard of, but they could be just flying under the radar possible. Yeah, that's possible. The issue is what happens if someone actually tries to do something like that and create a service and we should, we should explore that and get some more knowledge. We're just talking out our ass, right? We don't really know what's going on, but yeah, we, I like, I like your thinking and that's been also part of my thinking is what are the ways that we can do things fully above board because we can't in consciousness recommend people to do illegal things. The risk is there. The stress of doing that is there, you know, we're not trying to do that, but we want to create a change and a lot of these changes change.

Speaker 4:          01:23:46       Creating events are illegal buyer government. So how to work our way around that. Well, some of the things find the legal psychedelic experiences breathing, you know, isolation tanks, certain types of meditation. But that's then if you want to take it farther. Yeah, go out of the country. I know in Canada, even the Boga is, is legal. I know South America, Canada, it's legal. Yeah. And in UK, Canada and UK, bogus legal. And then in most of South America I was because legal and also the church, the Church of Santa Diamond or udv and always get those two mixed up. I think there's two. There's two. They're both illegal now. I think both of us both. Yes. So that may be another way too, is really kind of allow people to become. Explain that for people don't know what the fuck you're talking about. So there's a, there's a freedom of religion act that allows you to have your sacrament, whatever that sacrament can be.

Speaker 4:          01:24:42       If it's intrinsic to your religion and there's two religions based out of Brazil that focus on the Iowasca as a major sacrament, um, and that's the union has a vigil to Lisa does, I don't know, it's in important. And then there's the church is sent to diamond, which is another one. And both of them use ios because the sacrament and they brought it all the way to the supreme court and said, hey, we want to use our sacrament to express our religious freedoms. And um, you know, one good good move by the supreme court is they, they upheld that based on the freedom of religion act and there was precedence for that based on the native American church, uh, claiming pod as their sacrament.

Speaker 1:          01:25:23       Well, you know that Alex Grey is creating his own church. Yeah. Yeah. It's just fascinating stuff. Oh, hey matt. We're in the middle of a podcast, so go fuck yourself. This is live. Got Five minutes. Yeah, come sit down. Relax. This is Eddie Brill. Ladies and gentlemen, who's a good friend from the old school, Boston days of standup comedy, who gave me some good advice when I was a young pup back in the day. Hold on and he's got to turn this on for you. And you were the second baseman on our little softball. Right? But this is my friend Dan who is a comic sub damn would

Speaker 3:          01:26:04       be breaking down the universe, but it's good to see you buddy. Yeah, that's good. What are you doing here?

Speaker 6:          01:26:08       Um, I'm running a showcase. I got this comedy festival that honors Johnny Carson in his hometown for comics were smart in town. Norfork Nebraska. Whoa. So he built this 1200 seat theater in his hometown. He loved it. And so to keep his name alive, it's like the sixth year of it. It's pretty, pretty top notch thing. Oh, okay. So you're here showcasing local comedians put them on that? Yeah. This is my. Each night I go to a different city. So I've been in Vancouver, Seattle, San Francisco, Denver. I'm here tonight. I Got Fort Lauderdale tomorrow. Oh, that's cool. So you guys isn't an 8:00 show. Is that what it is? Seven 30. Oh Great. So it's going to start in 10 minutes. Yeah, and they said you were here. I wanted to say hello. I'm good. I'm happy to see you. I haven't seen you forever. I know last time I saw you were at the Improv for like two minutes in La. I said, hey, I just want to say, hey buddy, you got to run. But before then I think it was like Boston.

Speaker 3:          01:26:58       Yeah. Lot Long,

Speaker 6:          01:27:00       long time ago. But I remember what I remember we were playing softball all the time and having a blast and the only. And there were a couple of guys who were like, we'll take it seriously, but you and I, we would dance at first base, second base. We would dance, we would sing and people. Matt Graham would be like, come on, take it seriously. I remember small group that's seen the Rogan dancing machine danced my dick off, but remember Brian Frazier, he was. He would get fucking huge argument. You were out, you were out. He made the fucking play. You were out. Yeah. People are. There's a Kagan playing third base

Speaker 3:          01:27:37       that was fun times, man, those, uh, those days for, we've, we've talked about them on the podcast a million times, but when I started in 1988, it was the most magical time in the history of standup comedy. I came along at the perfect moment and where Eddie was one of the headliners in Boston already. He was a couple of years ahead of me. There were so many great comics in that area. Is Kenny Rogers and alone? Yeah, I mean Don Gavin, Steve Sweeney, Lenny Clarke who was in Atlanta. Kevin, meaning Kevin Knox. It was these killers, killer comedians. There was. So Mike Donovan, Goldthwaite and uh, Tom Kenny. Yeah. A few of those guys who left. And Steven right there was a, there's a great documentary that a friend, his friend saw me to made this documentary about that time and he's got a lot of great old footage and they really captured what had happened because it really fell apart. And if you go back to Boston now, there's a few local comics. There's a few guys that are still making a living doing like the dicta already comedy hots and local gigs in town, but there's not this swarm of young talent like it was. Well,

Speaker 6:          01:28:45       when you. That's why you now you go to Austin and you know that's happening. That's what I'm going there in March because that's where the the comics are. Yeah. And then Seattle and. Yeah, Austin's fantastic. Denver to Margie Coil, she runs shit and

Speaker 1:          01:29:02       Denver, Wendy's place tuition every year for this festival. I at least get one or two people from Denver, so they're legit. They have a law. That's one of the reasons that I lived in Colorado for a little while. They had a legit stand up community. I'm like, I want to be a place where it's more relaxed but also has real comedy and that's, that's. There's only a few places, but Boston used to be the place, but there's a kid named Rick Jenkins member Rick, when he runs this place in Boston and Cambridge, the Boston comedy studio or something like that. It's in the Chinese restaurant. Right. And he's the one guy in Boston who's really keeping that city alive. So I go there and you know, when I do this festival, I looked for people. I go to the best comedy clubs in the best book or people like Margie Coil and say, show me your 10 or 12 best people in there.

Speaker 1:          01:29:46       You know, they make it easy for me. Well that's awesome, dude. I'm glad you're doing that man, because we need more, more young guys getting breaks and chances and there's a lot of them out there. People say, oh, it's, there's nobody good. But that's bullshit. Bullshit. So many great young men and women that are out there. And I find them all the time and they're popping up more and more now I think because of these, uh, you know, the Internet has created so many. Like Bo Burnham says, Sam. Yeah. He became a star on the Internet. You know, I met him once at one of these twitter functions. Super Nice Kid. I met in Montreal and he just tore the place apart. Became famous because of the Internet. Like literally someone found it and said, oh my God, listen to this. They sent it became viral boom, next thing you know, the guy selling out theaters, Justin Bieber, Justin Bieber, he's really young.

Speaker 1:          01:30:31       Ish. She was 15 when he was first doing. He's a great guy. It's, we live in beautiful times. Really is. And so every year I find 20 people, like I got drew Carey this year hosting and I always bring a legend like lily, I had dicavid in these kinds of people and then I find 20 of the on the cusp people who were ready to rock and roll and I bring them in and put them in a situation where they're all with great comics who were smart so that they're all, they're forced to take it to the next level. And then they working with likeminded comic. They're not working with, you know, some people who were kind of, you know, taking the middle of the road or that kind of a hacky. Right. So I went, you know, I'm doing this audition tonight, and the guy said, so, clean TB clinic, go edgy, smart, no milk toast.

Speaker 1:          01:31:14       You know, just like Johnny Carson would have had it on his show. Beautiful. If someone wants to be a part of this, if you're not coming to their town, how can they get information on it or how to be a part of it next year? It's called the great American comedy festival and the only reason I came with those words, great America comedy, Johnny Carson, Johnny Carson, get in touch with me at [inaudible] dot com. Write to me and I'll look at your link. Is it an email address they can write to us? Don't put it out there. They'll send you dick pics. I got enough of those. Eventually. Do on my own. I bet you. All right man. Well thank you brother. I just wanted to come say hi to know that you're in the middle of it and know it's so good to see you. Great to see you too, man.

Speaker 1:          01:31:54       I'm going to come after the podcast over a combined saying. Alright, sounds good. Nice to meet you. Real pleasure. Alright, Eddie Brown, ladies and gentlemen, my son Dan is how brother see you later on. Alright, we'll see you guys. Powerful Eddie, Bro. That's what it's like here in the Joe Rogan experience. Occasionally people drop by. That's pretty cool though. I liked how use doing that. Eddie was a, it's always nice to run into people that were a cool to you when they didn't have to be right, you know, and he was uh, he was always nice to me, like even back when I was a scrubbed men of character and he's just a good guy. Yeah. So fun. Happy Guy who really loves comedy, you know, so it's cool seeing him do something like that man. So are you still going to do some standup? I heard you were putting together this man.

Speaker 1:          01:32:43       Oh man, I gotta I got a few minutes ready. But it's, it's rough. It's really rough. I think my girlfriend is the only one that's heard it. She's, she's in the back and she's covered her eyes. She did one of those cat pictures or the cats like, wow, not this shit again, don't try any of my material and my wife ever. Like sometimes I'll be writing something down and she'll like, she'll go, what are you writing down? I'm like, do you really want to hear it? And just like, I don't know, do I really want to hear it? I go, okay, I'll tell you. Do you think this is funny, you know, like that, but I don't, I don't like try out shit on her. People don't appreciate that. And then the other problem is then they've heard it already and then they see you do it on stage and yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:33:28       And they probably would laugh that way. Whereas if they didn't know you were going to do it, like some people have said like they got upset at me because some of the stuff that was on my standup comedy special with stuff that I initially said on the podcast and then like explored further, but that's part of my creative process. I say something on the podcast and it's really funny. What am I supposed to do? Just let that go. No, I got to turn that bitch into a bit now. But uh, I. well that's just like, or with gold pieces in it. You've got to refine that down. Peurto yeah. With stuff. And that's the weird thing about standup comedy that people don't realize. It seems like a dude's just up there talking, but God damn, there's a lot more to it than that. There's so much extra shit.

Speaker 1:          01:34:11       It seems like one of the biggest challenges that I've ever. That's kind of what drew me to it is it seems so hard. You know, I've done like debate speaking. I've done large scale public speaking presentations, expressing ideas. Not, not difficult for me for whatever my constitution is, but to actually go up there and have to make people laugh, I look at it and say, I have no idea. I have no idea if this will cause a chuckle or they'll just be stone silent, you know? Yeah. It's, it's a funny art form because it's everybody's capable of doing it in certain like small doses. Everybody's capable of doing it like at a party or amongst friends or you can get a concept out that happens to be funny and, and a bunch of people laugh and that becomes very intoxicating, you know? But the idea that you can go and address a bunch of people that don't even know you, that are expecting to laugh, that paying money to sneak around the back and give them some landfill and they're looking for just the drink at some conversation. But a good guy to talk to is Brian because Brian sort of got in on the cheat codes because Brian was stand up comedy because Brian, when I first employed him wasn't doing comedy. He had done comedy, but he quit and he didn't do it for years and years and years and the day he went back and tried it again was during a UFC crowd in it Lanta on a fucking Friday night. Okay. So it was a gangster and it was a midnight show

Speaker 4:          01:35:44       and it's not like I had all my material remembered. It was like three, four years ago since I've been on stage and I just had to go up on there. Right.

Speaker 1:          01:35:51       I got only that. They didn't know you yet because this was pre podcast. This was pre podcast. This was like, now he has cheat codes. Now everybody knows who he is. They know he's ridiculous. He goes out there and talks about coming on. People started laughing. He said, there it is. Say you

Speaker 4:          01:36:12       about five years or something like that. I can't watch it.

Speaker 1:          01:36:17       Yeah, he, uh, you didn't eat a dick, but you had several moments where you licked the shaft and put some balls in your mouth, but you didn't, you didn't eat the deck, you know, I pulled out of it too. Like that was one of the most impressive things I've said that night because you had some moments where you did really well and then you have a dropoff bad. I was like, oh no, he's fucked. And that's the hardest thing is when they lose confidence in you and they're not laughing to bring them back and only imagine. Yeah, it doesn't ever work in black crowds, black crowds. Once you lose it, you got to get off the stage and run. You can't try to get it back because it's not coming back.

Speaker 4:          01:36:54       Yeah. I saw Brian Brian a couple years ago and he was, you were okay then, but I saw you in Austin and you were fucking good man. Thanks like I got to give you some prompts like you were seriously funny there. So it's been, it's been cool to see that

Speaker 1:          01:37:08       he's got the cheat codes but he also has a material too. He works at it. He's, he's up tonight at the ice house, but if you're going to do it, man,

Speaker 4:          01:37:16       you got to just jump in. You to jump in. I'm thinking how much material have you written? Well, I've timed myself and I have like a nine minute, seven minute, five minute, kinda three minute. I've gotten that far so I know

Speaker 1:          01:37:31       well that much. If you have nine minutes you could probably do five minutes. Yeah. You need to. Vegan material needs to be true. I'm sure. Yes. But I have nothing to trim it by like I don't. It's funny. So how do I turn that? That shit. I got to just bomb a few times. Like, Oh that sort of list you to read it to yourself. You got to listen. Like you know, comedy, you've seen a lot of comedy shows. You gotta able to sit there and

Speaker 2:          01:37:56       like sort of listened to it yourself and likes. But that's hard too, because there's some shit. Sometimes I'll write something and I'll think it's funny and then I'll go on stage and one part of it that I didn't think was funny is the funniest part. They're like howling laughing at this one observation and I thought that this other part was the really funny part. It's, it's very, it's comedy to this day is still. There's a lot of mystery involved in it. There's a lot of. It's a lot of weirdness. It's a strange art form. The challenging part for me at this point is just deciding on my tone because there's almost a persona that you bring up there. It's you, but it's you being a little bit more of this or that. Like the type of energy you bring. Some comics are kind of laid back and they sneak the jokes in some more intense and they bring a lot of energy into it.

Speaker 2:          01:38:45       Your delivery style delivery stuff, you know, you bring a lot of intensity generally in and it had crushed and killed. But then you'll see somebody else who's Kinda, I guess like Mitch Hedberg or someone like that who's like really kind of cool planet and it's like, I dunno, I don't know how to play my own material. That's wow. That's a good point. I've been doing it for so long. I've sort of accepted the way I do it. You don't really enemy. I very into like certain bits, like certain bits or like more quiet than other bits which are more frenzied. But I, yeah. Now when I write material I write it for my voice already. Nobody here that. Okay. Yeah, it is. Yeah. Yeah. This. And there's no right way to do it either, man. And I've seen guys change. That's weird. Weird. When you see a guy who starts off and he's sort of Jerry Seinfeld Dash, and then somewhere along the line it becomes Dane Cook and you're like, what happened here?

Speaker 2:          01:39:33       Like you, you like morphed man. They're just trying to find them. My Shit's weird right now because I start. My new bits are more story based bits. And then I go into these long stories that have bits in it. But then it goes into my older material, which is more just like joke, joke, joke, joke, joke, jokes per minute. Where that's. Yeah, well that's the evolution. The evolution is you first start off, I think, uh, you try to get things out of your mouth that are going to get laughs and you look at them as tools. Like there's this hammer work, you know, you're just trying to get it to work. That's the first stage. And then the second stage is, well, okay, well what makes you laugh instead of what makes them laugh? What, what do you, what do you know? What works instead of that, what would make you laugh if you were in the audience?

Speaker 2:          01:40:19       And then the third stage is how do you get ideas across and point things out that you think are funny. So like as you're moving through the stages, the first is just sort of jokes and then it becomes jokes that you think are funny and then it becomes like things that you're relating to different aspects of your life. And there's like stages of the development of comedy. I fascinated. I think for me, the the thing that that may get me to actually do it is I feel like if I create interesting enough observations, even if the comedy isn't quite up to mustard, they'll come back and be like, Oh yeah, that was interesting that he brought that point up, you know, which

Speaker 1:          01:40:54       is probably kind of a backwards way to do it, but at least it's given me something to hang onto, so if I fucking bomb I will at least make them aware of some shit they were not aware of before. Yeah. Well Bill Hicks out of that saying so even if you're not funny, be interesting. Yeah. Wow. Wow.

Speaker 6:          01:41:09       That's. Sometimes it seems like it would work, but other times where you're on a date with your girlfriend, like, let's laugh tonight. I want to go out and fucking laugh, and then you go do like a comedy show that's more like, just interesting. You'd probably be a little bit.

Speaker 1:          01:41:20       You would be. You would be. Yeah. Especially the kind of tricks that you bitches don't want to hear nothing. They want to hear poopy farty jokes. Yeah. No, it's a good point. I mean, sometimes people just want to, um, they just want to fucking scales. Yeah. Yeah. Like sometimes you want to go see a James Bond movie. I don't give a fuck if it's realistic, you know, by the way, that last one wasn't realistic at all. Far or whatever the fuck it was. Shit was ridiculous. It was ridiculous. But that Daniel Craig guys the best James Bond. I agree. He's way better than that. Fucking Pierce Brosnan. Cat. Yeah. He was the worst. A lot of these dynasties. I think you're getting better batman bond together tonight. The new spider man. Fuck that. Spiderman. Twilight, Spiderman. That's why you like it. I can't believe you're saying that. What's wrong with the news part of.

Speaker 6:          01:42:12       I don't even remember. I just remember I hated it. Is that the amazing spiderman? The Lizard? I didn't see that. I was confused. I was just used to toby. I think tobey maguire is a good Peter Parker and to make them all twilight. He, I heard toby's ICAN. Oh, I've heard it. He's a good peer for her.

Speaker 1:          01:42:28       Someone whose name rhymes with high end Helen, by the way, Brian. Kaylin will be with us this February first at Mandalay bay. Me already should fear Brian Callen Vegas socket. We're going to be at the Mandalay Bay events center. It's the same place where they do the ins and uh, it's going to be crazy. Oh, big venue. Biggest yet. Um, it's pretty fucking big. It's big. You know, it should be fun too because the Super Bowl weekend in Vegas. So we're supposed to be. It was supposed to be Diaz, Diaz, Diaz as an agent. Now he's like someone that actually booking a place. So he says he's going to do things. I can't do that. I forgot my fucking age is booked. We somehow make Columbus. I'm in this place. He's a, he's got a lot. He gets up at fucking 6:00 in the morning to do his podcast. It doesn't such a good idea from like 6:00 AM. You think that's a good idea for him? He's always up. He's up. I mean he gets up early and tweets, like in one hour I'm going to bed. It's 5:00 AM and he's tweeting and in one hour the Church of what happened now is a star. That was the last time you saw 6:00 AM from that side, Brian,

Speaker 6:          01:43:36       about the backside flights never waking up. No, not even that because they usually stay awake for flights,

Speaker 1:          01:43:43       so I don't think I've seen it in a long, long time. Years. Yeah. That's the Shit fucking existence. Getting up at 6:00 AM when you're not, you're not totally done sleeping and you have to get up. But for Joey he's done. That's when he's done. So weird. Yeah. I've seen him do his podcast a couple times, but I was still like partying from the night before. He's wide awake too. It's crazy. Gee, here's his. A national anthem rant. Did you hear that? Pull it up. Pull up Joey Diaz as national anthem because it's fucking hilarious. He was high as fuck. It's 6:00 AM going off about the national anthem. It's beautiful. That's a. that's a a guy who could change the world. He needs to be a court jester.

Speaker 7:          01:44:31       Let's try to get the guy to play the national anthem because listen to how high his voices. What is this shit? What is this evening at the fucking pops? There's a bunch of gay guys, but the national anthem with the Marines and people shoot people. What is this shit with the flag? You got a bunch of like gay marines playing that shit that trump. If I had a knife, I would throw them at you. Listened to be alive. Cocksuckers get up. This is one of the planes on the video. It looks like it should be okay.

Speaker 7:          01:45:11       Stop badmouthing your country and shit. Fuck this shit. I'm sick and fucking tired of hearing all this shit at this. No jobs at this best you want to go to. I'm sick and tired of the APP and Zbb erectile dysfunction. Get the fuck up yourself in the mirror you, but that you in American people are crying like a fucking pussy. You're a fucking American. Get bullied. People coming in because what happened to the stupid kids in the back of the class and shop teachers get guns. I want everybody with a fucking gun. You gotta protect yourself. You leave here with a fucking slingshot. I'm 50 fucking years old. You're a fucking American. Stop your crying. Fuck the NRA. Just get a gun. Get a BB gun, get a knife. Get up and stop complaining. You're a fucking American. That's what they should play at school.

Speaker 1:          01:46:25       Not that pledge of allegiance. Bullshit. Fifty cent and Joey Diaz coining the term. Get up. Yeah, to get Joyce's better. It's realistic. He's just trying to fuck white chicks. I know what's going on. Probably really successful. Especially with all that vitamin. Water money. Did you ever see that shit that happened with him? Floyd Mayweather. They had a fake feud online. No, I saw in the 24 slash seven that they were boys though. I lost so much respect for them for

Speaker 3:          01:46:50       that. They had a fake twitter feud where they pretended to be angry with each other to get attention because they were trying to. I don't know what they're trying to pump up. I don't know what a floyd's upcoming fights are. What the fuck. The idea behind it was, but a fake twitter feud between floyd and 50. So much as opposed

Speaker 4:          01:47:07       so much of that rap game is so much image though too, you know, it's, they're just really putting on something 50 is actually one thing I do respect about him is he actually wrote a book with Robert Greene called the 50th law and in it he's very honest about his calculating business approach to creating a persona that's going to sell. Well, you know, he doesn't, he doesn't party. He doesn't do all the shit he talks about, you know, sitting in the club with a bottle above. He's not doing that shit. He's back writing. He's plotting, he's planning, he's very calculated in what he does and when he talks he talks honestly about that. But to see him do some kind of public feud, it's just seems

Speaker 3:          01:47:41       cheap. Seems a little cheap. Stupid Hammond, floyd mayweather getting together. I mean aren't you guys both worth like a billion bucks? Fucking you fucking done like a couple of girls having a fake twitter feud. They probably watched beverly hills housewives land, man. We need to get that strategy.

Speaker 4:          01:47:58       They want to create some real drama. Get Floyd to fight fucking pack. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          01:48:02       Not Anymore. Not Anymore sailed. Yeah. That's sad. That one Marquez punched. Just changed, changed everything to punches the one that he knocked them down with earlier. That changes a little bit, but the end one, the big one to put them away. That was probably the most violent we've ever seen a hero get knocked out because the Tyson knockout was a beat down, but he was conscious and he was moving around trying to grab his mouthpiece and you know, the referee rescued him. He was standing up, you know, like the. If you look at like all the various times that someone was a hero and they got beat like in the prime, that was the most violent. A Guy just got completely starts. The second one would be Roy Jones jr when we fought Glenn Johnson, but by then he had already been knocked out one time. He wasn't, he didn't have that invincible. Eric. Yeah. He'd already gotten knocked out by a Fox. His name to do that. A handsome black guy. Fuck is his name.

Speaker 4:          01:49:06       I don't recall. It makes it. Makes me wonder if that, if that very questionable lost that Pacquiao had had some impact on a psychology when he was going out there, like he was a little more aggressive or something that he was really trying to prove that he wasn't going to leave it in the judge's hands.

Speaker 3:          01:49:23       Antonio Tarver Antonio Guy. Um, yeah. I think that could have something to do with them. And sometimes a fighter just has your number now. There's sometimes like they will, you know, there's that thing that they say style, make fights, makes fights and everybody says, oh, that's a cliche. And it Kinda is a cliche, but it kind of is true too. There's some guys that just have a guy's number. Vernon forrest with sugar. Shane Mosley Vernon forrest just had sugar. Shane's number. Just knew he knew how to beat him. He could beat him and sugar. Shane would beat more guys in Vernon would be if they both fought like the same guys. Sugar Shane would win more than Vernon would win. But when they got together Vernon, one twice and the way he wanted it didn't look like sugar. Shane was ever going to beat him. It looked like he just had his number and that's a strange thing with fighting and with fighting the way mark has and pack all lined up, man.

Speaker 3:          01:50:17       They were just so God damn close. There's like what his strengths were sorta overcame what pack strengths were and what Pascal strengths were, were adjusted enough to edge by. Mark has two in two different fights that Mark Marquez could take a fucking punch though. That's one of the reasons why he's always still in the game because he can take a punch and then fire back with his own shit. Whereas a lot of guys got overwhelmed by pack power, enhance speed Marquez could take it, man. He could take it. So that made him like extra day. I wonder what that is. I've tried to talk to the neurosurgeon that we have working with on it about that. You know what it is about an individual that allows them to take a punch. It's pretty interesting, you know, like what makes the short circuit easier happened, you know, the weak chin, I would imagine.

Speaker 3:          01:51:02       It's a combination of experience, experience, structure, structures, big guys like Mark Hunt who was legendary for his ability to take punches, cabbage who is legendary for his ability to take punches, big giant heads. You know, both those guys that just big giant fucking iron heads, but then there's all get some smaller Mexican box. There's a lot of Mexicans that really good chin, some reason not to generalize but just seems like that's part of the program and then some of those lighter weights I think with a lot of Mexicans would. It is also is a certain amount of your ability to take punishment is your desire to win and your drive and your heart and Mexican fighters have always been known for their heart and their toughness and endurance. Your ability to withstand a shot and come back because you're in shape and you recover. That's big, but Mexican fighters have always been known for their willingness to scrap and further their ability to take a shot and come back.

Speaker 3:          01:51:59       Yeah, and I think a lot of that has to be like a desire, a drive, and you're like, they're proud of their ability to like. They're not pussies, just overwhelming will. They don't want any way out. No way, no way out. Now looking for a way to. When you look at the great Mexican boxers that embodied that, like Julio Cesar Chavez. Yeah. Chavez in his prime was was that personified? He would bite Donna's mouthpiece and the bell would ring and he was coming after you and he wasn't thinking about whether or not he was gonna win. It was. He was definitely going to win. It was just going to beat your fucking ass. You know, he was going to India, you're hitting them hanging, hang them, handle meldrick. Taylor and him fought for 12 fucking hard browns and with 10 seconds to go and the twelfth he drops Meldrick Taylor and they stopped the fight.

Speaker 3:          01:52:42       I mean, it was ridiculous. Like he was looking for a way out. He was always trying to win and he was legendary and his ability to take a shot. But then again, frankie randall came around and had Chavez number, whereas he just had this fucking powerful straight, right. He knew how to land it and boom, all of a sudden Chavez was down and everybody's like, wow. And he beat him twice and it was one of those things where it's like, this is just a dude that has his number. He knows, he knows how to beat him. It's just weird how like how much you know stylistically how much that factors in to certain fights. Like there's certain guys where you could see them fight the same dude 100 times and they're never going to beat that guy and that guy breaks his hand or slipped a disc in the middle of a fight. You're not going to beat him. He's going to beat you. Right? Then there's Anderson Silva. This is fucking guys were. You

Speaker 4:          01:53:33       can't figure it out. Anybody that's ever going to beat him that. That was one of the more mindblowing sports events. There's been a couple of my life, but seeing him going to Brazil, Brazil, rob came with me to Brazil. We were ringside right there. While that fight happened, to see him do that is just just blew your mind. I mean, I've seen him do amazing things, pinpoint strikes, you know, great maneuvers. But the way he just did that, just saying, I don't care, I'm going to put myself, you know, he, he got, he dodged that spinning back, kick it, hit the fence, and then he goes right back where that kick landed. Like, okay, I mean you miss me there, but I'm gonna stand right here. And then just slip them. Oh my God,

Speaker 3:          01:54:12       God. It was what he was like operating on. Not just one level but several levels faster than Stephan Bonner where he could just move away from anything bonded through any punch that he threw he could roll with. It's like he, he had such faith in his reflexes and his skill of, of defense and avoiding things that he literally backed his body up to the cage and allowed to do to throw shots at him. I've never seen, never seen that. Never. And then when he decided to, when he stopped the fight, like almost immediately slammed a knee into a solar plexus. And the fights over and he just like, Holy Shit.

Speaker 4:          01:54:52       You have to imagine that was the same place that these legendary wars. We've talked about Masashi before, but that print, that place of no mind that I've been actually reading a book, which was a crazy radical book. I don't even know if we want to get into. It's called zero limits. But one good thing about it is it talks about getting to a zero state in the zero state is where there's no thought, no emotion, no anything else. The only thing left to come to you is inspiration, you know, but for an athlete, the zero state I think is the zone, you know, it's where there's absolutely nothing interfering with your training and your instincts. Yeah. And he just taps into that completely. So you know, his impulses are just right. There's no nothing blocking what he knows how to do. And he's trained himself to be the best already physically. And then mentally he's impeccable. You're

Speaker 3:          01:55:39       so confident now too. It's like with every fight that he's won in the octagon, he's like slowly moved his way into where he's at now, which is like this almost unreachable frequency. I like all these people that are trying to get to his title. You look at them and you're like, really? You really want a shot? That guy cause I'm looking at the way you move and I look at the way he moves and I'm like, I don't think you can move the way he moves and he's going to fuck you up. You know, and you know, they, they, a lot of them are talking good. You know, they're saying they want to get a piece at Anderson. They wanna get a piece of that and then you'll see them lose to some contender along the way and you're like, listen man, you got lucky.

Speaker 3:          01:56:13       You lucky you avoided that execution because the kind of execution that Anderson gives you is one of those retirement executions where you just step into ego. Stephen Bond, after that fight was flying back with Dana White and he said he was just shaking his head going, no one's ever done that to me before. I've never seen anybody do that. I didn't think anybody could do that. Was like, no one's ever done that to me before. That was humbling. It was like the guy's an alien, you know, and that, that kind of devastation that Anderson can put on you. You look at the mountain ahead of climbing to get to the level of proficiency that you saw him exhibit on you and you go, well, I can't get there. I did. My body doesn't move like that. There's certain physical limitations that certain people are just. They just have and certain fiscal advantages that some people just have like a guy like Jon Jones or you look at a guy like Kevin around them and when he was in his prime, he's one of my favorites as far as like unbelievable athleticism and speed and power.

Speaker 3:          01:57:12       Kevin Randleman when he was in his prime was just a. his nickname was the monster. It was a perfect nickname. He was a jump up in both of his legs, up in the air. It was so scary. It was such a fucking athlete and if you don't have that kind of athleticism, you are never going to be able to do the stuff that he can do. You can't move the way he moves, you just can't. And if a guy like Kevin Randleman who is this incredible athlete, dedicates himself and learns the techniques that I like, Anderson Silva learns and gets to that level proficiency and timing and confidence that Anderson Silva has and then another guy tries to get there but doesn't have the same body as Kevin Randleman. He won't be able to compete with Kevin Randleman. It's just there's, there's certain, there's the roll of the dice is not even everybody gets a different hand of cards and some people get to twos and some people like John Jones get four aces, you know, and it's, it's a weird thing, but that's just the way it is.

Speaker 3:          01:58:09       Seems like he's epitomized the body type for mma. You understand that Jon Jones? Well, both are long, long. You know, you find that for now you see it in basketball, you see it, the sports have kind of created a body type that's ideal. And I think with them you're seeing it exemplified that extra length, that extra snap reaches huge, huge. Uh, you know, I, I've always been short. So for me, fighting tall guys was always an issue. It was always like, was always like another thing that you're fighting. Trying to get. Trying to get close to them. Yeah. You

Speaker 1:          01:58:42       know, and, and developing timing. The thing about shorter guys don't like guys like Tyson showed that there's a certain amount of benefit to pink shorts because they can unload these ridiculous combinations in fast close quarters where you can't sort of like the, the tall, gangly person can't really deal with it, but the length of their arms actually becomes a disadvantage in mma. You see that with Hector Lombard, who's a fascinating specimen because he's not just this ridiculous power puncher, but he's also this massive, massively talented judo guy with giant muscles. So it's like he's this crusher who also has like the CIC grappling as well. So he's not worried about you taking them down because most likely you're not going to. So he's trying to close the distance and drop bombs on you. Did you see that fight with him and who some are porous? No, I missed that one.

Speaker 1:          01:59:33       Oh killer. What? Paul Harris is built just like A. Yeah, just like he is. So Lombard is like five, seven, 185 pounds of solid muscle as is [inaudible]. They're both like the same size. They're all built the same way, but Paul Harris can't crack the way that hector lumbar can crack. So Hector Lara just teed off on him and stopped him. But the. There's an advantage to that sort of body type, that Hector Lombard style body type, but I think there's a bigger advantage to the John Jones Anderson Silva type, but they're always be room for Tyson. Tyson created himself into an unstoppable force. You know, watching him train the old tyson training videos are awesome. Just how he would perfect that torque and that slip and then movement. It was like uncorking the most powerful force from the ground, like every part of his muscles working together. When he was throwing those hooks and upper cuts, the way his body was moving, he made himself into an unstoppable force for awhile and then you know, that petered out, but somebody could still do that.

Speaker 1:          02:00:31       There was also the intensity to his delivery that we had never seen before. Then the Tyson era before Tyson, we were looking at guys like Tony tubs and Pink Land Thomas and really like, you know, I don't want to say this with any disrespect, but there's no other way to say it. They were, they were lazy. They were just guys who were just. They, they, they really had no business being at the top of the heap in any other sport. They wouldn't have been. They wouldn't have been at the top of the heap in basketball like pink, pink and Thomas wouldn't have been an all star nfl running back. He didn't have that kind of discipline. He wasn't that kind of fighter, but Tyson was so he came along in this era, people who were slacking and here's a guy who it in work with me. I get up at 5:00 in the morning and do my jogging and the reason why I do my running at that time, it's because I know that no one else has the awake at that time. I remember him saying that and he will give me an extra inch. I don't remember like thinking like this guy is trying to get edges everywhere he can. He's getting up earlier than anybody running and he seemed running in the dark and he just looked like a muscle, just like a corded muscle. He was. He was built like unlike any heavyweight before him, except like he was like a bigger version of like Joe Frazier, like

Speaker 3:          02:01:40       a much more muscular version of Joe Frazier, but much faster, much faster, you know, like his, his ability to deliver punches. Like with speed, like there's a video of him hitting the heavy bag. It's one of the most ridiculous things you've ever seen in your life because he's hitting it like a flyweight. No heavyweights did that at the time. No one unleashed those kinds of like five, six punch combinations in satellite. Two seconds. He was a, he was the guy who came along and just said, everybody's operating at 70 Rpms. Okay, I'm going to go to a thousand. See if he can keep up. Good luck. Go, come get me. Have you seen some of those videos of like really young kids doing mma now? That's pretty dope. Yeah. This is two twins out of Vegas and uh, I've seen them hit the paths and stuff and when I saw them they were like five and I think they're probably about 10 or more, might be maybe 12 even now.

Speaker 3:          02:02:34       So they're approaching teenage years, which will be here before you know it. And then there'll be men and these guys, they started out there. They're a body has developed moving like that. Their bodies developed throwing up, you know, just effortless armbars and throwing combinations and leg kicks and shit. And their parents are super dedicated. Their parents take them to the gym all the time and they're always there with them and supporting them is pretty fucking wild there in that tap out commercial. You ever seen that commercial with the two kids? I haven't seen it, no. Let me see if I can find online because it's pretty wild. Just seeing the youtube stuff is crazy impressive. Oh yeah. And that's what Roy Mcdonald Man, these, um, these guys that are coming up now. I'm Brian, go to a Rufo brothers commercial r u f, f o Rufo brothers commercial. This is um, this is a commercial that they have for tap out and you see these little kids, they have a, they have Mohawks and they're throwing punches and kicks in the air and it's, it's, it's pretty wild looking at it. It's like everything they're doing, they do it perfectly. They're hitting the pads and they're hitting them perfectly. Throwing kicks, taking people down, doing duck unders and shit. And they like, their body is like developing, learning all these skills. And in the video Mark Coleman is coaching them.

Speaker 8:          02:03:57       Take downs. This one? Yeah, this is a good. This is it. Good smoothies. These little kids, man. I mean these are like babies. They look like they're like five and they're getting coaching by rest. His soul. Sean Tompkins, the background, one of the great mma coaches of all time who recently died. Great guy like he's ducking under there. Like this guy is holding the pads for. I'm look at mark. That's the hammer bitch. That's Mark Coleman motherfucker. He's teaching them how to take people down. Look him throwing up arm bars. They're tapping each other. It's amazing, man. Look at these combinations. Nice. Fucking five. That's so scary.

Speaker 1:          02:04:41       Bad ass little kids and if it's not them by the way, they're just one example. I'm sure there's a third of the movement. They're all over the world now. I mean people that are really into having their kids get into athletics, you know, they, they going to be a lot of crazy dads out there that want their kids to operate on the highest level. I'll take those kids. That's why you think so? I think they would. They would just dance around you and kick your legs until you gave up. I'll just hold him down. He would start coughing up these brown smurfs. They're just fucking. Hold on. You'd like fucking try to light up while you're. While you're. While I'm smoking. Yeah, so I will take. What do you think? What do you think the number of kids is that you couldn't take those kids and those kids?

Speaker 1:          02:05:25       How many would it be before you just got work? Seven seminar seven. Drove around on that. We went over this before I could take a thousand crows with a tennis racket. Yeah. I will fuck up a thousand crows with a tennis racket. I am a hundred percent convinced. Pretty big man. There's these crows at my house right now. That's fucked. I'm bringing the thunder son. I'm going to take that tennis racket. I'm going to put one of those things on so I can't lose it. It's kind of like tied around my. And I'm going to duct tape that bitch threw my hands and around my wrist and I'm just gonna fucking spin like a tornado and just I'll fuck up a 1000 crows. Set it up. There's like the size of cats. Yeah, and I'll fuck up a thousand cats to give me a thousand cats and a tennis racket. Thousand cats attack there. You'd be dead. Uh, no. First of all, they don't have any organizing skill, so they're going to go one at a time, like one of those Steven Seagal movies where they've got a circle and then dive in. Then I kinda liked cats. Don't act impacts counselor loaners and cats. One cat went in the other cats bug. Let's see what happens. There would be a little bit more clever. They wouldn't attack you and mass. This is all the cat would have to do. We've seen this video before.

Speaker 9:          02:06:43       All right, watch this

Speaker 1:          02:06:46       cat fucks this

Speaker 9:          02:06:47       scout.

Speaker 8:          02:06:52       Oh man, he's got a fucking choking it man. Oh man, I hope that flex that guy. Oh he does? Oh my God. Well this poor cat thinks is dying, man. You choking him around his neck

Speaker 9:          02:07:08       away. Good.

Speaker 1:          02:07:13       Does it get worse? It gets.

Speaker 8:          02:07:17       Cat's still not winning with the cats flopping around while he's getting strangled man. Now he's around. Get them, get them cat. And now the cat's just locked on, his leg is biting the fuck out of him. Get Him. He's basically biting them. Whereas Dick is really close

Speaker 6:          02:07:36       to his digging into cactus. Ran Away. He had to. He gave up. Can't get away.

Speaker 1:          02:07:41       Thundercats Ho. Yeah. If you want to get away in your cab by the do the Dick. That's what I learned from that video where I caught a thousand cap battle. Jesus Christ. Man. What? Why would they do that? And have it around its neck like that. You don't expect it to do.

Speaker 6:          02:07:55       Yeah. It was for one of those news stations where you're trying to adopt a cat. You know, where they like, they'll have like the reporter, you know, like this and kept it going. Live exist. Chicken Jack. Oh yeah.

Speaker 5:          02:08:07       Out of their car and killing them. That was part of this guys having fun. But that sound goes. You drop.

Speaker 1:          02:08:26       Wow. That girl, she, she, she fell out of her character right away. Is there any more annoying character then the news character person? The person who just. Everything seems fine here. We're just gonna adopt this cat. Just no real personality. It's like, look, I can't cookie cutter sort of way of, uh, of, of talking and behaving the local news anchor person like they, they want you, just all your personality just squeezed out. The most personality you have is like after some completely wacky story, you're allowed to go, well, isn't that something? All right, well, well here's, yeah, here's Bob with sports and you're allowed to do that. But you know, other than that, you have to act like your a completely robotic cookie cutter type of human being. Yeah. Here's why so many people get to that black guy who got the bug in his mouth and went ghetto. Do you remember that one? That's a good one because when black guys do that, it's perfect because when black eyes take on the black guy version of the white answer, Guy Announcer, guy from the news and then he got a bug in his mouth or some shit and he went fucking crazy motherfucker. He's just screaming engine.

Speaker 6:          02:09:37       You find that here's $100. It's only 100 and you think you get a thousand watts when this lady comes on when I'm dressing all those cats. Just fucking crazy cat lady. What is this? Yeah. She kept all these strays and she just has all these cats in her house, but where do they shit? Can you imagine what that smells like? Yeah, that's her house. Oh my God. They're gonna. Kill them is what she's called.

Speaker 1:          02:10:00       Look at her. She looks like cat enthusiasm. She looks like some of the girls that I dated when I was in my twenties, but now they're 60 Boston girls. Monster. Look, she's all dolled up for this to really get this crazy bitch ideas. You think your house smells like Piss. Hardly write. How much litter does she use in a day? 100 cats. Meanwhile they feel like they're in prison. It's like, why are we all inside? Do you have a door? Can we get outside? Can we get out of this APP? Why do you want to keep us in this house from birds? Which are you crazy? Have you heard about that? New Species of spider that makes its own decoys. No. Yeah, that's fucking

Speaker 3:          02:10:34       species of spider. Um, it's a, it's found in the pam bore pata t a, m b o Pata, pa Ta Tambo Tambo Potter Research Center in the Amazon. And these, they make a decoy out of leaves, dead dead bug parts and other scraps. And they piece together an artificial spider. And what comes after it though? Who has a jacket? Spider. That's a really good fucking question. Something has to be trying to jacket or if they're setting themselves up as bait to reinforce is so fucked though. I assume that nothing's safe. I think everything gets jacked in the rain forest. Probably. What? What is, what's safe

Speaker 10:         02:11:19       really happened on that Thursday here to Augusta high school that led to Chris Woods. Deck contrast propped up town country as fucked up town because a bug flew in and please get the fuck out this country. My little fuck. Okay.

Speaker 3:          02:11:52       Got Real real quick. The fake news. Caster voice. What is it? Those people I think are the biggest perverts because I think it's a lot like a. and this is not based on any research whatsoever, I'm just talking out my ass. But I think if I had to guess, I would say that that allow those dudes are perverted because of the same reason why Catholic priests become perverted. You tell them they can't fuck ever, you know? Then they get suppressed and like you tell these people they can't behave nutty ever. And they go, they go off the deep end. This is a restricting other emotions though. So maybe they're just really. They just lose their fucking temper. They lose their cool. Like, like that. Oh yeah. Because they're there. So like cause emotional repression, personality repression on a lot of ambien. Did you all. Lot of Ambien.

Speaker 3:          02:12:38       There's a lot of ambien. The sports world. A lot of the guys I work with take Ambien, let guys in the production on the UFC, they're always fucking pop and Ambien. They pop them on a plane, pop them in a hotel room like you guys are fucking crazy man. Ipod, new mood, mood, Melatonin. Just kind of fuck. I forget what I was going to download. God dammit. I was trying to bring these giants. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Fuck God dammit. Oh Shit. I totally lost my thought. It was about a spider. Fuck. God dammit. I hate when that happens. Now Brian fucked me up by throwing up this video of this guy. We were talking about the spider. No Amazon fucking things up. Things dying. Now. God Damn it. Train

Speaker 1:          02:13:32       of thought on podcasts is never a free flowing pie chart where you can. It's not a linear progression tree where branches are floating in the air and you've got to grab them while you can or a where you are. You're losing them. I lost that one fucking shit. Why you laughing? Fucker. Just all funny picture of what? This is a catch. Getting a snowball.

Speaker 6:          02:14:00       Oh, the cat taking stovall right in the face. He's gonna be trying to catch the ball.

Speaker 1:          02:14:07       Oh, that's hilarious. That's the things you do when you live in Ohio. Throw snowballs at. You can.

Speaker 5:          02:14:13       Okay.

Speaker 1:          02:14:15       Damn. I wish I could remember what the fuck I wanted to bring up.

Speaker 5:          02:14:19       Fuck. 'Em.

Speaker 1:          02:14:24       It had something to do with the Amazon. Had something to do with spiders and crazy shit that they're, uh, they're finding now in the Amazon. They never run out of things that will kill you down there. They're always fun. Some new shit they found in, um, in the Congo, they found a group of spiders that acts as a pack first time they've ever observed this, that there's hundreds of spiders and they make big gigantic web. And then when big shit goes in there like rats or something big enough, they just swarm it and fuck it up. That's a nightmare for me. Yeah. Know they figured out how to act as packs. It's really spooky. I think there's a youtube video of that too. Hold on. Spiders act as packs. My girlfriend is covering her eyes. She has a massive spider phobia is really incredible. It's like legit, like legit, like as strong as any spider phobia in any other human ever.

Speaker 6:          02:15:14       Does she know that? That, that couch had uh, an ESA spider eggs in it? Did it really? Yeah. Why was that? Why did you have any? I think I killed it off. I just sprayed windex on it today. I don't think that's bad right now. Her back is tensing up really hard and she's losing some muscular control. There is a few times to yourself, but it gets close. I just kidding. There's a spider. They're just next to a bunch of com. Brian pulled this up.

Speaker 1:          02:15:39       Fighters living in groups in Congo on Youtube. Spiders living in groups in Congo. There's a the first video that comes up on a google search. It's a BBC documentary that shows these fucking spiders acting as a pack. Spiders. They found a frog that flies recently,

Speaker 6:          02:16:02       like a flying squirrel. They're going to find so much shit underwater to the Congo. Africa mighty as far as to bitch is not even there. She's in a backyard right now pretending she's too pretty to be in the condo.

Speaker 11:         02:16:20       Walking all these spiders fight as creepy enough. Put these communal spiders leaving groups of up to 1500 single giant web. Look at that. That's so fucked her. She's got her head down and see it. Whenever you want to come over here and take to the nightmare. Look at what happens when they get something. They just all swarm and oh, they're super little rush to see what sticks. Maybe that math might be the size of a fucking going for a neutral spine is working together like this. It makes sense here in the underworld as whips are often destroyed by rain falling debris, animals charging through spiders do loose if their web repairs at night and I can't see me getting much rest either. Masturbating.

Speaker 4:          02:17:17       Dude, that's. That's scary. Yeah, that sucks. The fat one. There's A. There's a video on ridiculousness of this guy trying to capture a giant spider in Australia on the wall and he has like this tupperware and a helmet and he goes to put it on the thing and the thing just jumps right at his face. Bam. Hits him right in the helmet. That was some spooky shit too. Or how about a spider and some cocaine? Use this video. Joe Spider on cocaine. Spider with a whole bunch of cocaine.

Speaker 6:          02:17:44       Is it real? That's not real and I guess he just starts freaking out.

Speaker 5:          02:17:54       I think I would kill him.

Speaker 6:          02:17:56       Probably Sugar. You ever seen a spider on acid? Wait a minute. Spider is this real brand slicks enemy to me. I don't think it's animated, but I dunno if it's cocaine, cocaine, what is he doing? Oh my God. He's covering himself with sand cocaine. He's just like, ah.

Speaker 8:          02:18:14       It is that they are they actually saying that it's cocaine. If you had that much coke, the last thing you'd want to do is experiment with spiders, spider, and it was in a hooker's asshole. You'd go, yeah, maybe that's guys got real coke, which is just a spider like that. Yeah. There's A. There's a youtube video called spiders

Speaker 12:         02:18:31       drugs, which I believe they back in the day that gave acid inspires the Steve, what?

Speaker 13:         02:18:38       The spider is the most accomplished of all web building species. Recently, scientists gave these tiny creatures a variety of psychoactive drugs to observe their effects on web building. When given a minute dose of Lsd, the spider's Web took on an unfamiliar minimalist structure that didn't get much work done when given caffeine, the web structure was not affected, but the spiders behavior was whoa. Given thc the active ingredient in marijuana, the spider didn't build a web. It built a hammock where it lay all day and watch the caffeine spider go,

Speaker 8:          02:19:25       that Shit's not true.

Speaker 1:          02:19:29       That's not true. You just fuck people over with this information. That's so wrong, man. It's not true. Right.

Speaker 13:         02:19:36       I think there really was. There really was a test called cane spider. Figured building webs was for soccer, waited until the caffeine spider was exhausted. Then came up behind it and pop the cap and it's asked Mr Krzak spider spider had no place to live. It ended up in the crack web as the crack spiders bitch for more information on the crack spiders. That's so funny.

Speaker 1:          02:20:10       That's ridiculous. Did you hear about this study that they're. They're trying to do at Harvard medical school is looking for an adventurous woman who's willing to give birth to a neanderthal. Awesome. This is there really going to make a neanderthal from. We're going to make out of fucking human being. I don't know how the fuck they're going to do like Jurassic Park style. They find an old bone and they're going to get some DNA out of there and well, what's really bananas is that they're actually creating a life that is essentially a type of human being. I mean, neanderthals are essentially a type of human being, right? I mean that's the. That's, that's the definition. Okay. They're not homosapien, but they are a type of human being. Right? Like, isn't that like Homo Floresiensis? Are they a type of human? I don't know. Are they a type of primate?

Speaker 1:          02:21:00       We haven't had to cross that bridge. It hasn't come up yet. That's a slippery slope. How far back do we still have to give them the rights of people or should we give them the rights of people? We should treat all animals with respect, but you know how far back in the species chain do we declare somebody assenting it being well, yeah. Not only that, what do you do with this thing and you allow it to go into society and mate, do you allow it to have a life? What if you make a male and it starts raping? What if it goes in the UFC? What if it goes into the UFC or GEICO Christ? What if it's five feet tall? Two hundred pounds. That's what neanderthals. Wade and just chimp strong because neanderthals by the way, had bone structure that was completely different than ours. I mean you, their bones were much thicker, much heavier, you know, they, they were literally five feet tall, 200 pounds and that's just different.

Speaker 1:          02:21:52       They're built different than human beings. What would that would they allow that have to be a whole new set of Nevada State Athletic Commission? A lot of things in our society would get really kind of weird if there was another set of and b. Did you see district nine or did you like it? That was all right. I liked it. I thought it was pretty interesting what they were trying to do. If you haven't seen as a science fiction movie about this alien spacecrafts wasn't there supposed to be more of them? Yeah, I think they're going to do another one. They were going to do it. They left room at the end of it for a sequel, but it was the science. Cgi

Speaker 3:          02:22:26       animation gotten good enough where they could make a realistic movie about these, these aliens living amongst people and the way they did it was pretty. It was pretty cool about how they just sort of assimilated in sort of became a part of life here on earth that people just dealt with. The fact that these, uh, what did they call them? They called them. They had some fucking creepy name for them that pissed them off. Oh yeah. Yeah. But I mean if they went a hold and went and went ahead rather and did this and created neanderthals, we might find out why neanderthals are extinct, you know, we might've killed them off. I mean, it's very possible that human beings killed them off because we don't know what their behavior was like. But we do know what the behavior of a lot of other primates is.

Speaker 3:          02:23:10       Like we know how fucking ruthless chimpanzees ruthless baboons are. What if we know how ruthless people are, we know how ruthless Homo Sapiens neanderthals and take it to the next level. What are the fucking baby and psychos because we found evidence of of cannibalism on a lot of human corpses that they think might have been either a result of homosapiens or neanderthals prey Predator, neanderthals going after people, and then there might've been like humans hunting humans in the nfl, hunting people or people hunting them. They also know that it was one of the things that talked about with the Steve Rinella. The native Americans were rampant, cannibals and a lot of parts of this country for show or for me, for me. Really? Yeah. Especially the Great Lakes area. Apparently Great Lakes area. They were known for catching people and eating them. That's one of the things that's always difficult when you look at these cultures that you revere because I certainly revere a lot of things about native American spirituality and certain things about Mezo, American spirituality as well, but then you see these cultures in their peak doing things like human sacrifice cannibalism or weird things and they're like, well, we weren't quite there yet at some good principles.

Speaker 3:          02:24:27       Yeah. They were still ripping people's hearts out to please the sun. God. Well, the, the creation of the temple of Tlt will con is that said the Aztec temple where they killed 80,000 people in four days. They sacrificed something like 80,000 people. They were all prisoners essentially that they use to build the temple. Then once they were done, they're like, okay, cool. We're gonna fucking kill you all now. Now that we, now that we're done. So it's like on one hand you have this amazing society that's capable of creating such a magnificent structure like this huge, gigantic Aztec temple. But the other hand, they're also capable of killing everybody that helped build it, cut their fucking hearts out, chuck and them down a flight of stone stairs, thump, thump, thump, thump, thump. Next, somebody. I'm Dan Dodi, uh, one of the guys that was working on that media to show with me when we were going over this.

Speaker 3:          02:25:22       We were talking about how crazy those numbers are. He did a calculation of it. It means you have to kill someone every 13 seconds. Massive, massive obsidian, the city and knives and stab their fucking hack in your head off with a stone ax and they're killing someone every 13 seconds. It's intense. This doctor has a really crazy ideal and outlook on this to sort of justify. You can tell that this guy wants to do this. This is one of his goal, wasn't of his quotes. If you become a monoculture, you are at great risk of perishing. Therefore, the recreation of neanderthals would be mainly a question of societal risk avoidance. So he's saying that it would benefit the human race to reincorporate neanderthals into our population.

Speaker 3:          02:26:13       You know, man, fuck. Do you know what they're like? They are way more primitive than us. Where words this accepting that physically they're way more dominant than us. They probably would beat us in sports. Their bones are thicker, much stronger. Yet if we could outsmart them, but here's the thing. They had bigger brains than us. Yeah, but we won. Yeah, but why did we win? Did we win because we're the more evil. No, I wonder. I wonder what the hell was. I think that's why we got to do it. Just figure it out. I think we're more clever than them because there's also evidence that neanderthals had figured out a lot of shit that we figured out, like tool making and fire. They didn't figure out the Internet though. They didn't have guns. Dummies. Yeah. I think. I think we're on a path towards more clever and more spiritually enlightened, but it's a very divergent path that has big errors and big fuck ups and big terminal nodes that really aren't going anywhere.

Speaker 3:          02:27:09       Maybe you're just going to have people die. Were the cuts. Maybe we won and where the cuts and the neanderthals have won. Maybe they were like way cooler than us and they were just overwhelmed them with continuous and maybe you're all the shit that we point to as like problems in our society could all be avoided if we went back to being the anatomic one. That was the triumph of evil ever. Get on it. Well, this is one of the things that the guy's saying that neanderthals might think differently than we do. We know they have a larger cranial size and they could even be more intelligent than us. Wow. That is crazy. I never heard anybody say that when the time comes to deal with an epidemic of getting off the planet or whatever, it's conceivable that their way of thinking could be beneficial.

Speaker 3:          02:27:48       This guy's fucking crazy. Their way of thinking. He wants to raise a fucking civilization of neanderthals. He wants to bring this guy probably masturbates to pictures of balls. He's probably a freaks. This guy's asking a woman to give birth to a fucking new kind of monkey or a new kind of whatever the fuck it is. If it's not a human. I mean we're humans Homosapien, right. Is that the case? So what is that? So neonatologists another type of primate or is another type of is another? No, I think it was a different chain. I think as far as I recall,

Speaker 4:          02:28:22       and this is a little vague, but I think it was a different chain of evolution where that when terminated in neanderthal and another one, all the homo erectus, Homo Sapiens, they all went on another evolutionary chain. I think that's how it went. I don't think there's a direct link, but I dunno.

Speaker 3:          02:28:40       Yeah, I dunno either.

Speaker 4:          02:28:43       Yeah, interesting to think about though. And it also gets, you know, the minute you introduce, especially in more advanced cultures, like if, if there were an alien culture that would come, the amount of chaos that would cause, particularly in the religious structure of things would be earth shaking. I mean the whole tenants of all of this that we are created in God's image perfectly blah blah, blah. That and then you have someone who's smarter, Cooler, badder than us, you know, and then how does, how do you rectify that with all these major religions? I think that's, that would be the biggest. There would be a huge upheaval if that happened. Massive chaos. Yeah. What the fuck man.

Speaker 3:          02:29:26       Have you google neanderthal profile of a super predator. This is one a widely discounted and I should say this widely discounted theory, however, it's kind of fun. Kind of fun to talk about it. Neanderthal poor profile. Um, what did I google profile of a monster? The profile of the Super Predator. This, uh, this guy had this idea that the, the vision that we had of neanderthals looking just like us was really based on nothing. We don't have any actual neanderthal bodies were putting skin on them and recreating them with clay. And why would we do this and make it look like that when we might want to make it look like a gorilla or a champ or a profile. Super Predator. Look up videos, buddy video. Go to video. Youtube. What does that. Would you put butthole or Mexican in there? How are you getting all these, this mustache yet? What are you doing? How are you getting this? Oh, that's not neanderthals. Google did it. Cool. Thyra. Yeah, that's what you need. It's just any, a looking mustache and a n, d, e r t h a l.

Speaker 4:          02:30:55       that's it. Click on the first one. It's kind of cool. Go full screen on this bitch.

Speaker 10:         02:31:03       So the car, the accepted view of what the look like. A big hairy than us and with a lot of those and think thicker brow ridges. But apart from that there are unquestionably human. In fact, it's been said that if you gave the Neanderthal to shape the head count and dressed him up in a nice suit, he can easily attend Harvard, although it named rich parents. There's a couple of things wrong with this picture. First, it's not based on any sound, archaeological evidence. That's because soft tissue features like skin hair, color and non preserved the undertone. The other reason is that after studying the end of those for 10 years, I'm convinced they look nothing like this at all. I've only been remaining or throw them at us here on the end, the thought predation created modern humans. In this video, I'm going to draw on the latest archeological, genetic and forensic evidence to challenge our assumptions about what neanderthals look like.

Speaker 3:          02:32:05       It looks like something we should make a kettle bell.

Speaker 10:         02:32:11       You can see examples of this enter promoting bias in television documentaries and in museum reconstructions around the world. Men are sometimes showers quite handsome. We just want to get to try it back there. We and some of them, I believe that neanderthal males so began hunting human females mistakes really size. It really makes me mad of sexual and cannibalistic predation went on for an excess of $50,000.

Speaker 3:          02:32:48       Imagine if. Imagine if you had one of those coming after Mrs Rogan. Woo Man. Could you imagine if we were you. We recreate this thing and it does come out looking like that, that this woman gives birth is neanderthal and it comes out looking like an ape. It really tests them are fucked up black face with big gigantic teeth and knows how to use spears. I think this guy is like really quacky though, and he is Australian, which makes them extra quacky. No, there's not a lot of like super experts that people take seriously that top light that. Except for grandma on the bush, he's English, but English is completely different. If you have English, you can sell things that people wouldn't ordinarily buy. Like cooking where if you have like an English salesperson. Yeah. But uh, but Australian, unless you're selling boomerangs or some sort of a crocodile gun, you know, you're not going to listen to Australian dude.

Speaker 3:          02:33:40       He's just there to fun, loving, carefree people. They're not really the right are archeologists are the right people to tell you what a fucking neanderthal looks like. At least the way we want them to be. Yeah. I wonder if this is bullshit. Like I said, this guy's widely widely been discredited the aquatic ape theory, which had me for about an hour and a half. Yeah, that's a weird one, right? There's a theory. They're wondering why human beings are so fatty when we're babies as opposed to other primates which come out like champs when they're babies, they come out and they're looking. They look pretty rugged like right out of the gate. They got sin. You. They don't have a lot of body, but people were like

Speaker 2:          02:34:18       balls of fat and the idea was that we were born to sort of be able to float around and water and then we lived by the water. We were aquatic apes while we did live by the water. When those volcanoes happen, I think that was something that the genetic bottleneck theory, which does have some criticisms too, but when these volcanoes happen, if forced everybody to the only life source that was available at the time which was coming out of the ocean is those were the, those were the, you know, the fish and the seaweed and things that were unaffected by the massive climate change and the, the, the shit that was in the air that was causing people massive death.

Speaker 3:          02:34:53       Well, they say even to this day, 80 percent of the world's population lives near the water, which is kind of fascinating because as the water level rises, if something catastrophic happens, I mean that, that really would leave a fucking lot of confused motherfuckers in the middle. You know, if the world. It's like say if the United States and every other part of the world, everything a thousand miles in each direction was covered with ocean and you're just left with the center of the United States. Good luck. Okay. Got dudes who know how to make bows and arrows. You know, I mean for real. If you were left with like South Dakota, if South Dakota was all the humans that were above water and everything else done, you got plenty of food. Okay, but there's no more internet and you've got to figure out society from scratch, from only the people in South Dakota.

Speaker 2:          02:35:43       Just a total random sampling. That's a tough go. Good luck. Good luck away. Most of these catastrophic work tasks, Duffy's work though is the smartest, the brightest, the cleverest. They are the ones that ended up surviving or you put a gun in their mouth because they don't want to survive with all these fucking dummies trying to eat them and they're like, you know what? I think I'm going to just check out and see what's next. You know, it was a crazy place to go with Pompei and you go there and you see when the people are frozen and ash like huddling with their kids within that just rolled through and discipline just blew up and vesuvius rolled in and kicked everything in. Ash, that's a crazy, crazy moment. Frozen in time. It's interesting to see, and not that long ago either. No, no. Remember Mount St Helen's remember when we were younger?

Speaker 2:          02:36:28       Yeah, super young. That was a. That was a big one. Man. That was a. There was a Washington state and a giant volcano blew off. We just don't see enough of those. They happen so rarely were like, oh, okay. That's what fucking happens. There was that one in Iceland that fucked up air travel, but yeah, that was a little bit of a baby one. Yeah, I think. I Dunno. I think it has a big brother though that when that one goes off, then I think the last time that happened that the water froze, like really far up the Mississippi River and things got really fucked. It was like a two year winter crops failed. This was around like 18, 12 I think. So an Icelandic volcano in 18, 12 caused a two year winter in America. It's just because they put so in the atmosphere

Speaker 3:          02:37:16       that cools everything off. Can we get a big fan and fix that shit? You'd think something right below it on China. Push it. Another direction with that shine is already making the big fan to blow on us. They probably got fans, they're launching and space like a fan, but with wings and it's going to just hover fan with a helicopter blade and just hovers up there and blows. I don't think that any of these ideas work. Yeah, the natural disasters, that one thing that people aren't prepared for that they don't. You know, everybody's worried about the government collapsing. Everybody's worried about the end of the world and oh, what if a dollar is useless, which are really should worry about man, it's fucking super volcanoes and asteroids. Those are the big ones. And this, if a super volcano in Iceland can cause a two year winter in America, what happens of yellowstone blows with what happens at that motherfucker takes off that species extinction time.

Speaker 3:          02:38:15       It's weird. It's like our society is. It's so dependent upon this state of the atmosphere staying the where it is, but we have so much evidence shows that it really doesn't last and it changes radically all over the world. And then, you know, different parts of the world are sometimes covered in ice and then a few million years later, the tropical rain forest and you know, what do you do? You just, I guess you just move and adopt, moving, adapt. Rather there was a harvard, a biologist or an astronomer rather recently that was saying that he doesn't believe that he doesn't believe that we are a or he does believe rather than we're unique in that we're. We're the only life form possibly in the whole world that's like us and that our situation is so rare with our ability to have lasted this long protected by Jupiter. All the asteroids are hitting Jupiter and that our environment has been so stable for so long that it's allowed this crazy explosion of intelligence and innovation and that the odds of that actually happening anywhere else in the world or anywhere else in the universe are incredibly, incredibly, incredibly rare.

Speaker 4:          02:39:21       And then. But then you have to multiply that by an infinite, virtually infinite universe. And the fact that if you propose that other species in this virtually infinite universe just started a bit earlier and they evolved to the point where they can travel, they are going to be the ones that traveled to us prior to us traveling to them

Speaker 3:          02:39:39       and they have legal mushrooms, obviously. Maybe they made mushrooms and they put 'em on asteroids and send them our way. A little helping hand. Well, that scene a little pat on the butt. That's the theory about how life on this Panspermia Panspermia with mushrooms. There was another show that I watched. It's Morgan Freedman's show through the wormhole where this astrophysicists was explaining the infinite in that the universe is so big that there are the. The odds are that there is an exact duplicate of you what the exact cells and the exact life experiences and it's, you know, an infinite number of trillions of miles away. Like if you. You can't even wrap your head around how far away it is. But infinity is so big that it means that the world as it exists today, exactly what the exact adams in the exact order that the universe is so big that it could exist, not just exist, but exist in so many different forms that the exact creation of this earth, the exact events that have taken place all have been recreated on this

Speaker 4:          02:40:54       planet. There is a. yeah, there is. I heard that in a different way saying that your actions echo in eternity because of that same thing, because everything that you do now will be repeated just by the law of infinity by another you at another point in another time period in another universe or in the same one. So it was the idea was that your actions echo in eternity because those, those impetuses, the choices you make will be duplicated in another experience. And then that is crazy.

Speaker 3:          02:41:26       Then there's the Uber Mind Fuck decision universe scenario where every decision you make branches off and do a completely new in independent universe and they're all parallel existing and that every time you make a decision for the positive or for the negative, the entire universe is restructured around you and it's a completely new one and that will any similarities to the previous universe or just just that similarities that you are existing in these new planes that have been recreated over and over and over again and that life, much like we see in when you break the world down to subatomic particles and then break it and bring it all the way up to universes and galaxies, that the universe and it's moments are fractal as well, and they are also infinite and that in these decisions, in moments, you create infinite universes. I get so crazy, but the universe itself is so crazy. Why is that any crazier? You know, why is it any crazier than an infinite universe? Why is that any crazier than hundreds of billions of galaxies, Wyoming? It's all fucking crazy. Like you can't wrap your head around and you're like, Hey, I have 150 acres of Oh well fucking whip the shit. The Universe is infinite and what's 150 acres? That doesn't mean anything

Speaker 4:          02:42:44       to explore these topics. I remember there was a philosophical conundrum in which the philosopher says, I can prove to you that if I shoot an Arrow at a target that it will never hit the target and here's how they do it. At a certain point, the Arrow would be halfway to the target and that takes a certain amount of time. At another point the Arrow will be, you know. Then you take the next half, so at a certain that the next half point, that will also take a certain amount of time. Then you take the next half point to where it's halfway to the. That'll take another

Speaker 2:          02:43:12       amount of time while there's always going to be another half point which is going to have a time value and so if there's a continuous amount of time value in the half point of distance moved by a coworker by whatever, infinite a measurement by that logic. The arrows should never hit the target, and you start to think about that. You're like, Huh, yeah, that's fucked up. That's some hippie bullshit that hit that target. Exactly. That's what we all know has never been bowhunting. Need to get with Ted nugent and say, get out your fancy graph and watch this bitch. See Your theory sucks. A fat deck, because that's a dead deer. That's right, and there used to be in those philosophical debates, there will be people, especially in the skeptical debate. There was one famous instance where I think someone just slap someone in the face that you think you think nothing is real. How about this back and just hit one of the skeptics in the face like that was real, wasn't it? I just started fucking around with too many. Whatever got slapped away. It goes. There are too many

Speaker 3:          02:44:14       10 minutes. That means we're going to wrap this bitch up and bring it home. Aubrey. Marcus, you are a bad motherfucker. Thank you very much. My friends coming here. It was awesome. Was We went on a double date last night. That was powerful. A good times, man. And, uh, we'll uh, we'll move on with many, many new things in the future and I think, uh, I think this hunting thing is a good idea. Yeah, I think there's something to explore in that. It can be revolution,

Speaker 2:          02:44:37       at least. Gentlemen. Absolutely play. It plays out. Well, that'll get us kicked off youtube. Don't do it. So people want to check some more stuff out for me. Warrior poet.us at warrior poets, my twitter and I also put out a new video inspired by the style of Jason Silva. You can get to that@vimeodotcomslashwarriorpoetthatUSworriedaboutusorwhatisawarrior.com bringing me giant, a giant

Speaker 3:          02:45:01       video. It's really fun. I love, I think the world of feeds off of inspiration to a certain extent. Anytime you could do something like that, that is a little burst.
