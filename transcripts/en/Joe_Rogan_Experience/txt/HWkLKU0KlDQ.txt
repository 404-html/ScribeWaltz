Speaker 1:          00:00:52       on the people considered. Okay. San Francisco is a beautiful place. It's a very unusual school. Ended that corner. So it's important for a place like San Francisco to exist to be that far off the left wing trail. What's interesting about, they're really conservative up there that just conservative liberals. That's very well put there. Unbending, you know exactly what they think on every issue. There's this episode of the Joe Rogan experience podcast is brought to you by squarespace.com. Uh, I don't know if squarespace's in San Francisco, but a lot of smart motherfuckers are a lot of smart dudes up. Oh yeah. My rarer brilliant.

Speaker 1:          00:01:54       Start a business if you wanted to do that squarespace's like one of the easiest ways to do it. Unlike in the past we had to like get to know a program and like learn dreamweaver or actually try to code it yourself with html, which is so beyond my grasp. I don't even, I wouldn't even think about attempting to do that. I know how stupid I am. But with squarespace you can do it and it's pretty easy and there's a bunch of different cool designs and you don't have to even pay to try it out. If you go to squarespace.com forward slash Joe, you don't need to give them any credit card. Just go and check it out. And if you want to use it, then use the code named Joe.

Really it's, it makes it so much easier than back in the design and you can make like a really competent site and you could build an online store like super easy to do. So go check it out. You fucks got through it. That was good. Do you like that? I throw that angry part at the end. It made me legitimate even though I'm selling them something that ghetto and I gotta get my street cred back. That's what it is. Yeah. You know, folks, there's a certain amount of gross snus and selling anything and I'll absolutely admit that there's a certain amount of gross snus and saying the same thing over and over again. Go to ting and tings, a cool company and sell shit you don't believe in.

Speaker 1:          00:03:35       That is true and if I'm wrong about any of this stuff, I'll let you know as well. Like what if team turned out to be evil? You know, tim was a secret branch of the government, designed to get you more happy with your phone. People are getting discontents. 10 came along with a better deal. Calm everybody down. Another conspiracy. People on the phone. We need him on the phone all the time. Let's make it cheaper. Cheaper. Have you ever met anybody through a way? You wouldn't have to even it with somebody, but the idea like because I suffered from online people meet black people have one commercial that you see that no. What is this place for black people to meet black like a website. They're so hard. Why don't you just go to a black neighborhood, go to a bar.

Speaker 1:          00:04:19       They have a website. Well, if it's, you know, nothing wrong with being specific, you know, I mean, if can't imagine, Italians don't think so. There's got to be an Italian is looking for Italians website. This guy. Yeah, because Italians love other Italians are an Italian girl. Oh, they're the worst to the best of the worst. Be related to the savages sexually. They're fucking animals. Oh my goodness. They're fucking beasts. They're, they're like, they're. Yeah. The savages. They are savages. I liked the, I like a girl who's not like me. The liquid. We used to say she's a good kid. She's a good kid. But the last, the tiny girlfriend I had, she's like, she's likely to swing at me. No. Should we get crazy? Yeah. Yeah, that's what my friend said to me about it. He said, I've never cheated on my wife. I'd be afraid to stab me in the neck.

Speaker 1:          00:05:16       I was asleep. You know, this is a girl like del girlfriend the last. That was the last one. I was like, you though. Yeah. I was like, I think I was 21. She was great kid. Beautiful person, but they're just, wow. I keep in touch with her. No, I do not know. I do just testing you. A Tang is the other podcast. Sponsor Tang is a cell phone company that uses sprint backbone and what it does is they. They have it set up so there's no contract, so you can quit anytime you want. You buy the phones. The phones that they sell are the best android phones available. They have all the high end android devices including the Samsung Galaxy note to which is this crazy fucking phone. I've never seen this thing before. It's. It is preposterous. It's gigantic preposterous phone. It's the one that starts your car and all that does is sets the climate and the car, like if it's cold, so ridiculous. It starts your car. How is that possible? Is that really possible? And App it starts your car. Oh yeah, because there's remotes for awhile because they. They would do it like in like in Montreal called places Tom Around. I'm not ready for this yet. I'm not ready for apps to start your fucking car. I'm not ready for that. That's too much. Car pulls up. Get in Joe.

Speaker 1:          00:06:40       Google cars, they're doing that already dumb. They already have these remote control cars and they drive around the city and they drive themselves. They react to cars coming at them. They haven't even been getting in accidents. It's nuts. It's fucking nuts and I still wouldn't trust it. Well, I can't imagine sitting in the back seat, but my car driving itself, there are a lot of fucking assholes out there, Tom that drive cars. There's a lot of fucking assholes. I saw some kid the other day just weaving in and out of traffic. Speeding. He was flying past people in like a real, like arrested while he was in the wrong place at the right time, you know, he was doing the wrong thing at the right time. There's no cops anywhere by him, but with the way he was driving was like really crazy aggressive, like cutting people off and racing in front of him.

Speaker 1:          00:07:25       It was dangerous. Like he was like, he was cutting like random strangers, like off, like barely missing their car. It was kind of maniacal to walk like every now and then you just get a person like that. It's just really crazy article about teenagers that their brains aren't fully developed and there's a reason to get in so many accidents because their perception, the reactions are good physically, but they make wrong choices. Terrible choices. I was a terrible driver when I was a terrible, terrible driver. Now see me drive. Don't even watch. Could pull it off. Would you be happy if Google came along with something that you can say, take me home and the fucking robot call. That's common mind mind. If I open up a six pack, I would definitely. If you're drinking and driving and your car, your car is driving itself. Can you still get arrested?

Speaker 1:          00:08:12       If it's a very good question because you would have to. It would have to know for sure. You know where you're going, right? No, you wouldn't. You couldn't tell it to, hey, go fucking driving the wrong lane of this street. I mean, we would have to be some sort of. It would have to have a. A thing that said it couldn't do it, so there wouldn't to be. How does it know when there's a light to turn green? Has It? No one, there's a light turns red and it's going to have to be plugged into the whole system. Now there's going to be have to be, you know, if you really think about it, it's going to have to be like a wifi network or something everywhere that controls these cars. I mean they would have to have real control to to let a car go and just drive around with no person touching the and make sure that it stays on path.

Speaker 1:          00:08:58       Wow. I would think that would be really hard to trust. I mean, I don't know how you controlling it. I don't understand what's. How's it getting to it? It's got to get there from the cell phone has got to be some sort of a signal that's reaching the car. Unless the car is just a robot, a self sufficient robot, which is even crazier. That means no one is controlling it. That means it just goes on what it knows about what's in front of it with radar or whatever. It's using sonar. I don't know when it's using who. That's crazy. That's kind of nuts at the end. If that happens, that's an APP that you get the fucking take download Merera home app and you press that or your phone and your fucking car just drives you home. Why is that so weird to me? Of course that's coming, right?

Speaker 1:          00:09:40       Take me home while you hungry. That's all, isn't it? It's coming. It's coming. It's amazing how technology has advanced so much in the last five years we had panic attacks. If we forget our cell phone now I have a panic attack. If I forgot my cell phone. Yeah, and you know it's. It's so valuable for finding shit out. It's so valuable for like going on websites to read anymore because they can get the answers at their fingertips, slept well. It's not that you don't have to read, but man information is flowing so much quicker now. Like if you knew you had a question for Google, it'll be like a really hard thing to do to research the question and there was like a lot of people who developed some really good bullshit arguments back in those days and the they don't hold up anymore because of Google.

Speaker 1:          00:10:25       Wikipedia is not necessarily always right over here in the argument. Yeah, there's always a. yeah, that's a. that's a big one. People love to say that there's, but there's always gonna be people downplaying it, but the bottom line is it's no one knows everything. It's impossible and you could find some more and more things because of this. Like, this is amazing. This is a great time to be alive. This is your phone. You fucking pick up your phone. Do you talk to him? Tell him to go to websites for you. I mean, this is where we. Have you ever used that google voice? Oh yeah. He beat the shit. You press it and you say dom irrera and it'll go right to your website. Pulls up. I liked the one where you'd go call called Joe. Oh yeah, that's true. Yeah. Yeah. They go, yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:11:10       They, almost all of them also have the ability to read text so you can, you can talk to it a write shit down for you, which is a really helpful, like you ever used that? Um, that note thing on the iphone. Uh, yeah. Oh, it's beautiful. You can talk to it dom, like I can press this button and say my rare is a bad motherfucker and it literally will say, damn, I rare is a bad motherfucker. I was trying to get a porn this morning. Oh, you said it was on your phone. They'll know a direct TV and it was because it was cougars seeking kittens, which I don't know. I find very erotic. Like the older women that like young girls. Really? Yeah. Yeah. So I'm looking at the fucking thing. Wouldn't listen to my phone number. I kept saying six, nine, four. She goes six, nine, five and then I'm getting mad at the.

Speaker 1:          00:12:04       When you open up your fucking years, six nine for you fucking Douche bag. This is what you get for trying to buy porn. I know why you're trying to buy porn. It was super specific. Yeah, and I just think I'm too lazy to download it and Shit. I hear you. It's always much easier to use that credit card. Yeah, it is because they just send it to your bill. You don't even have to read the letters. Go Rogan.ting.com. And Save Twenty five bucks. It's a credit. What is the jail cell phone company with no contracts? I like to know contracts and because that's another commitment in life. I'd rather not me. Why do you need it for cell phones? That always bugs me. That's gross one. And they keep adding a couple of years. Every time you take it back to you motherfuckers. Dom irrera team doesn't do that conspiracy.

Speaker 1:          00:12:53       They also, they save you money on a bell by if you don't use, like if you use under your minutes, they credit you the difference in the next bill, they bump you down to a lower level and they credit you the difference. So it's an awesome company. The grant a, check them out on it. Dot Com is our last sponsor. If you go go to o, n n I t if you haven't been there in a while, there's a lot of new shit, especially in the strength and conditioning department. We have these primal bells now, which are insane. They're the coolest fucking Kettlebell and the history of the universe. Um, we uh, had the idea of doing kettlebells with these evil chimpanzee faces on them. And this, uh, this chimpanzee's face. Can you pull that face up? Jamie Chimpanzee's face? It just looks like he's about to fucking kill you.

Speaker 1:          00:13:46       Can you see it? Oh, I see. Oh, I love that thing because when I work out with it, I pretend that I'd have to fight that thing to the death. That's what I do when I work out. What's the fear of God into you? It was amazing how much stronger they are. The not. It's not even. It's we're so silly because they look kind of the same size as us. She gets super confused, but we are made out of Jello. Okay. And that, that thing is coated steel. The chimpanzees are stupid, strong, like we can't even get it around our head. It's, it would be so strong that once it grabbed a hold of you, you would feel so helpless. You'd feel so helpless. A 150 pound champ was like a 500 pound man. I've written one that ate that woman's face. Oh Jesus. There's so terrifying.

Speaker 1:          00:14:35       These fucking things. So to have one as a Kettlebell is the shit son and it's only 36 pounds and you're like, Joe Rogan, I aint no pussy. And I'm like, dude, I didn't say you were. But the reality is I have a workout for you that will work with that 1:35 pound Kettlebell. I guarantee you it'll kick your ass. So the extreme kettlebell cardio DVD, we sell it on a, on a.com, and we have the new one extreme kettlebell too, which I haven't done yet, but I'm sure it's awesome. That Guy Keith Weber is a bad motherfucker and it's a great way to like you forced yourself to just keep up with them. Just force yourself to do what he's doing and it'll just kick your fucking ass. I'm built like that under my president buddy. I know dumb or wherever you're in the. It's in the right underneath my layer.

Plays Good Pool. Yeah. I would get so excited.

Speaker 4:          00:17:55       I remember bringing you up thinking this is a new breed of convenience. This kid looks like a fucking tough kid. Even when I didn't know you were in the martial arts, just thinking. I mean you were funny. You were always funny. I'm not just stroking you, but remember bringing it up, thinking st the fucking kid who had problems with his mother talks about is, you know what I mean? Because it was a different. I told you this before, you're a group of comedians were like more tougher men. I grew up in a lot of like nebbishy Kinda.

Speaker 1:          00:18:22       Well I, I grew up doing comedy. I started out in Boston and that, those guys that's particularly meeting ground. Yeah, they are particularly manly. You know, who made me think that I could do it honestly, like who? It didn't make me think that the way I looked would be an impediment was nick Depaulo oh, okay. Because Nick Depaulo was great head of hair, so fucking devastatingly handsome guy who's way better looking than me and he was bigger than me. It's a big, like a football player. Yeah, he was, he was hilarious and I was like, it was a weight off my shoulders because I remember thinking that I looked like, like an athlete or something and it looked like a jock, you know, if you look at good jock, like you automatically categorized and it automatically makes you less funny. Yeah, yeah. No, it's definitely. I mean there's like, look at Gary. Gary Goldman. Yes. Perfect example. Beautiful Man to talk to. Yeah. Beautiful. Perfect.

Speaker 4:          00:19:14       He's cute. You don't like about hips? Got Beautiful. Fucking devastatingly handsome, man. He's big, handsome. One time. Kightlinger. He's Hunky. He's, I'd like to take into a prison cell. Uh, Laura Kightlinger, right? We're an Ireland. Remember? Sure. Yeah, very funny. Very pretty word. She's dressed. It looks like a fucking model and she's dying on stage and she's really fun. She goes, what happened? I go, you look too good. The guys can't laugh at you. The girls don't think you're funny because you're too pretty and the guys can't live because their girlfriends or looking at them, see if their left and looking at you.

Speaker 1:          00:19:48       Do you know Brian Frazier? Do you remember? Brian Frazier from Boston probably stopped doing standup, but uh, he, he writes, we, I haven't spoke to him quite a bit, but uh, he at one point in time was enormous. He was a bodybuilder and he, I mean he was super. He like, he's one of those super dedicated super disciplined dudes that can force himself to work an hour and a half a day and eat strictly healthy. He was fucking drunk. I mean, he was huge. Then you would go on stage with like a golf shirt on and I had a poem sign, Dude, you can't wear that. Right? And he's like, why? And I go, because you're too big. I go, trust me, I go, you got to try to stay in this. I guess I go, dude, I, I, you know, you're my friend and uh, you make me nervous.

Speaker 1:          00:20:32       Like you're fucking arms are gigantic. They had like bouncing in his arms. They were too big. He couldn't stop. He couldn't not look at them. How about Pisco? And he got, let me know those things at the carnival where you stick your head into the muscle man's body. Yeah. That's episcopal look like, yes, no, no. Brian Frazier was bigger than him. I'm telling you. Was the big no, he was. No, no, no. It's Pisco. Maybe. Yeah. But frazier was just like super dedicated. He was like crazy dedicated. Here's a funny fucking story because he, he, he's a really funny guy and he looks like baby, like an Irish guy from the midwest, but he's Jewish and he's, he at this time had like a really fucking. He's, you know, he's got a temper and he doesn't like people fucking with them, you know, he was, I mean, he and I never had any problems, but he was a at a Gig and Vermont once and we would get, we worked together up there and um, that he had a little bit of a problem with his voice.

Speaker 1:          00:21:33       He had a little bit of a cold and so he was saying to the, uh, to the, uh, owner of the club, it was like apologizing for his, uh, his voice being a fucked up. And the guy who owned the club said something like, you know what, what are you being a Jew or something? Ooh, something along those lines, like you sound like a Jew because he didn't think he was Jewish. It was something along those lines. It was like really crude and you're like, and Brian went fucking crazy. He went crazy. It was a desk between him and the guy and that's probably the only thing that stopped him from smashing this guy, but he was so scary because he was like really fucking strong. And I remember thinking like, because back then like I didn't even lift weights, like I would die. I never lifted weights to my window days.

Speaker 1:          00:22:22       I was like, I was pretty skinny in comparison. He was like way bigger than me. I was like, God damn, I don't know if I can stop him from hurting this guy, you know, because he's just so much stronger than him. He could just run right through them like a bowl. But that one thing the guy said to him like, don't be a Jew. Like what are you being a Jew? I forget, I forget what it was, but I remember like going, Oh shit, like that's the moment where you're trying to talk your friend at a doing something really stupid or the moment like, I know how you feel, I know how you feel and your right to be upset, but please don't do anything. Let's get the fuck Outta here. If you do something right now, that's going to be stupid. It's a mistake and it's going to fuck up your freedom.

Speaker 1:          00:23:03       You're going to get locked in a cage. You're not going to do this. There's now civilized people do keep the fuck away from people if you don't like them, but you don't have to beat him up. You know that. That gets weird. I, I know when you get that look that you are thinking, but you don't go into action. Remember one night we were drunk and kids came up to the pool hall and one kid just fucking lit you up and I just looked at you at the. I know he ain't going to lose it, but this kid has no idea that fucking dangerous. Well, he was. I remember what you're talking about. It's just drunk men. Yeah, I mean I couldn't imagine what it's like to be a woman and deal with the drunk man wanting to hold you down and fuck you in the same type of like you would just run into people that are just.

Speaker 4:          00:23:46       The name did not like that when they're sober. I don't know. I mean some people just have a problem with drinking. They just get weird, but when you're around him, like aggressive drunk dudes. It's so unfortunate. It's like, oh, what a fucking predicament. This has got to suck to be a check. Then they start repeating themselves and. But I always say, look, the law, it doesn't bothers me a little bit, but at least it's not threatening like it as to a check. I really always think about that when I see those kind of really drunk, Douchey guys. It's gonna be a terrifying thing to have a guy you know want to hold you down. Fuck you. It is. It's got to be awful. Tell me the story. Tell me the truth. That's terrible. I can't take it anymore. My back's killing me when you were saying that thing about, you know, it's kind of fucked it that still around, isn't it?

Speaker 4:          00:24:33       Yeah. Well, you know, I with my God daughter living with me, I can't sleep unless she's home. You know what I mean? And like honestly my Godson, he's closed blood. If he got blown at a party by the kids' mother through the Party, I'd go dad that much. Tell me about it and don't read it. Don't wrap the lady out here. But you know what I mean? It's like, it's so different with girls. It's totally different. It's totally different. I was thinking of something you said before about when he said he was, the guy was Jewish and he didn't know how you're part of your culture, your party background. I was married to a Jewish woman, right. And I one day I said not meaning it in anything, just my own ignorance. I said, yeah, maybe we can do. We can do the guy down. And she said, that's really insulting. I go, why? And she said she explained it to me. So then I just start saying, let's Christian that motherfucker down just to, just to bring it back on myself. That's funny. <Unk> frazier

Speaker 1:          00:25:28       got mad at me for using that expression of that guy. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I mean they get mad at me, like threaten me, you know, we were friends, but he's like, you know, that's really a rude thing to say in Atlanta. But I was like, you know, I've always said it. I never thought of it. I didn't even think of as a bad thing. I was like, you know, guys got gold chains on always Guinea and ended up, yeah, no, you want to get some money on jus the guy down it. I didn't think it was bad to be frugal. No know

Speaker 4:          00:25:54       I never connected the two. I never meant it as a set it. And then I saw that it was obvious once he said, I was like, yeah, I guess that is pretty insensitive. Do you know that they, they got a guy today, 95 years old who was a Nazi at the one of the camps, 95 native rest of them. I think you think he's gonna get life, but, but seriously it's. Did you see it and say that's a terrible thing for Karma? That tech. I lived that large and Tina, he had 95. That was a big thing they said. He said he would. Yeah, they all went there. He said he was a cook at the camp concentration camp. God. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          00:26:37       You know what's scary about the Nazis is that that that shit was not that long ago. These guys are still here, still alive. So most of them are still. Well, that's why I think about when, when Mel Brooks did the producers how fresh that was. I mean, how fucking ballsy was that. Don't be a dummy. Bah Marty. Come and join the Nazi party. Remember when they were doing the goose step dance. You remember the movie and I was thinking that was in the sixties and the war didn't until the forties. 40th five, seven. I think it was. It was. It 47, so I thought it was 45 or whatever. It wasn't that far back and he did this whole thing about Hitler. It was fucking hilarious. And total balls. Oh yeah, no, it was 45. It ended malpractices. Bad motherfucker still is. Still is. Apparently Brian Callahan knows him or knows.

Speaker 4:          00:27:28       Oh No, no. It's Fitzsimmons fits fitzsimmons. Taoism says a guy just fucking hangs around because they don't go to a coffee shop and talk to him. I met him in the street, like a super personable guy. Just a real nice guy enjoying life. His fucking son is a bad ass author. His son is the one that wrote that World War z movie. Oh yeah. Yeah. His son wrote the book, which I guess a lot of people. I haven't seen the movie yet obviously, but a lot of people are pissed that they deviated from the book. Sometimes they do that, but uh, yeah. It's his son's band as author. He did two of the funniest movies ever. Young Frankenstein producers blazing saddles. Three to three movies. Movie Young Frankenstein was fucking hilarious at the time. He was a. He was the man, I mean if you went to see a mel brooks movie, like there's really no one to compare it to today because he would act in them.

Speaker 4:          00:28:27       He would. I always had to sing or something like I saw high anxiety. Yeah, they was singing like a lounging land singer. He's got high anxiety and he goes it each time you are near the idea of Zion. So fucking stupid. Mel Brooks was a genius man. He was a powerful, prolific genius. He tells a lot of really good stuff. At the time was him and woody allen kind of like in. I don't know. It was more silly. Yeah. That's pretty fucking silly. Yeah, yeah, sure. I love the one where he's playing the cello and I'm marching band billy has to run up and sit down for a couple of bars there. Take the money and run. If you've seen a mel brooks history of the world. Yeah. Oh yeah. It's funny, man. It's beautiful stuff. It's beautiful stuff. At the time, like I was just, there was nobody.

Speaker 4:          00:29:20       There is nobody else like that. Making movies like that. It was like you heard it was a mel brooks movie. You knew you were. It was a certain standard. Yeah. Comedy that you're going to get. It's great stuff though. They could never make blazing saddles today. No, they couldn't. Just political tubes. Racially charged. Yeah. I mean there could never be an all in the family today. It's true. Yeah. I don't. I don't believe that. And it's sad. It's sad that people would, you know, the good thing is, look, it sucks that people like that ever exists, that there really could be a guy like archie bunker that's at racist. Yeah. But it's still fun. My uncle was like that. We had family members that were like that. There were people that were worse in that by the way, like way worse than you wouldn't even give black people credit for being good looking.

Speaker 4:          00:30:03       You know what I mean? Like if a black woman was beautifully go, that's a white nose. She got a white note. You know what I mean? Like she, he bring up for white people are beautiful and like that's fun, but it was real. You know what I mean? He hate, he hated like, you know, cause I was a kid, I grew up with the Beatles, he hated the Beatles. He hated like anything rock and roll that was ruination of the world. Well, you know what time I think I used to wonder what the fuck that was all about. And I think what it really boils down to is that people have these weird natural tribal instincts. They have these weird tribal instincts and they belong to a tribe. And whether that tribes being a republican or would that tribe is listening to classical music, you know, wherever the fuck it is that they decide this is where they draw the line.

Speaker 4:          00:30:50       This is where they stand. It's a tribal thing. You know, it's, it's a weird deviations of our need to form groups, you know, so we'll get upset about shit that doesn't matter even a little bit. I try and not be stuck in any one area. You know, the only thing I was thinking, I don't even know if this is funny or not, but where's, what's gonna Happen in the rock and roll hall of fame in 15 years? Like when there's no groups left and it's like, rap music is dominant. Hey, you know what I mean? Like, because they're going to be like a motherfucker. This motherfucker minimally. No, not like any rap music. I do kind of like. Well, I mean I like, I like what's snoop? Snoop is great. I think I like m and M. I love some of the music. What would you like by m and M on itunes?

Speaker 4:          00:31:38       Yeah. I couldn't imagine seeing dot Merera I get brought up to date. What do you want to lose yourself? You lose yourself. Yeah. So that's fucking great. In the beginning is great. And uh, just, you know, when you get one chance in a lifetime, don't blow it. Yeah. No, that's a beautiful song. Yeah. Now he's a bad motherfucker. I'm an alum and I liked the one mama never meant to hurt. You never met. I'm cleaning out my closet is pretty fucking great. Fucking songs coming out soon. Does it really good for him, man? He's brilliant. Yeah, I think he doesn't like to perform. I heard that. That was a problem that doesn't like to go outside. Well, you know, I mean then yeah, I'll fucking famous, don't do this. You know, he got so famous. I mean he got crazy famous. He got famous to the point where it's probably probably fucks with your head.

Speaker 4:          00:32:22       Yeah. We used them. I was thinking last time we were shooting pool and you're very good with people, but the guy got on your nerves because joe was just, we getting tired and we both, both of us were kind of tired and you said I'm a fucking wreck in the balls. He wants you to take a picture. She was like, that made a, there was no good tie. The poor guy. I mean he was, you were nice to him anyway, but I just knew you weren't in the mood for. It's just drunks in that guy particularly. That was no big deal. Yeah. That was just, you know, someone was just enthusiastic and want to take a picture. That's all good. It doesn't bother me at all that what bothers me is that the drunk thing where you know, the drunk close to your face, that clunky, repetitive, they grab you.

Speaker 4:          00:33:08       I really liked that. Grabbed my neck again, I go for the I'm, I'm cool with everything, but the drunk thing and if it seems like you're drunk, it's like, Ooh boy. I don't know. He drunk to. How close do I get to a stranger? You know? He'd never seen me drunk A. I've seen you drunk as soon as jack at the laugh factory. Really? Yeah. How long ago? At least an hour ago. An hour to go and I think he's seen me drunk. Yeah, it was. It was months ago. Many, many months ago. One of the last. I mean I've only been at the laugh factory and maybe three or four times over the past decade. You're not going to come back? No. I would come back Wednesday night. Show mine. I'll do whatever you're doing. If you're doing shit there, I'll be happy to do your fucking balls with them. I'd be happy to do it because they are likely to do the half hour at the end.

Speaker 4:          00:33:55       Then we have the interview. Yeah. That was fun. You had a great crowd. It was. There were smart people, you know. That was a. That was a fun crowd, but I've been. I've been to the laugh factory. I sent like four or five times. One of those times you were drunk. You motherfucker. I was drunk. What stage? No, no, none unstable. One time. One time on stage. I was drunk because I said something and then when I realized I was drunk I said something to go know what the fuck you talking about? He would say like in an attacking way, they like confused and I realize that. Fuck you. He gives me an Irish coffee. You can't give an Irish coffee with half that. There's so much whiskey. The coffee's cold. Oh, is that what he did? Yeah. And I'm taking flight training to have them look up to a damn.

Speaker 4:          00:34:39       So what does that like five tanks? Probably five whiskies. Yeah. Shots. Yeah. At least that links my balls hurt. You say that like, Oh, what else makes you out to a restaurant? Lists that would. A friend of mine, you know, there's guys that make everything sexual, like whatever. And the waitress was fish was taken along and get you some Zucchini sticks. This has nothing to do with sex and when she walks away, he goes, I'll give you the Zucchini stick. Fucking. It'd be like not to do with any of the tubes that always have that I gave you want a sandwich? Yeah, I'll give you a fucking sell meat ball right here.

Speaker 4:          00:35:27       Like I said, I'm glad I'm a girl. I'm bleeding that a girl to be fucking scary. I never seen a girl. It's such a defined back. I've seen them. I've seen some big ones, but the one who came out last week, she's got an Adam's apple, who's, I forget her name, that she just went into the pros. Just the. I think her team won the national championship. Brittney griner? Yeah. When you're going into the pros for what she was saying, she. She's got like a beard on her dick. So fucking. She's so mad. She came out of the closet. Who is she? She's. She was. She's like the all time shot blocker in the NCAA, the women's division. She is like a maze is basketball, but I mean the thing is it was nothing. It meant nothing to anybody. Then the guy comes out, the seven foot guy, the twin, which he didn't tell his twin brother who was gay. Did you see that? He came out of the closet, but he came out of the closet at 34. This guy is this guy, but look at her. Adam's apple. Wait a minute. Hold up. What's going on there? That's a girl. That's a girl.

Speaker 4:          00:36:40       Sure.

Speaker 5:          00:36:43       Second.

Speaker 1:          00:36:44       So she just came out of the closet. Is that what you're saying? There's a player who plays in the NBA. His name is Jason Collins. He just came out this week in a sports illustrated. That was a big deal, right? Yeah. Was he the first gay player ever? It was the first who is actively was still might be playing, but he might not even make a team because he's 34 and he's not any good. It's like a third string center. He might've done it because they've done it for that. Maybe he would go preds crude. You're saying? Anyway, gay just to for publicity. That's what you're saying.

Speaker 4:          00:37:16       Well, I know he's gay. I can see by the way,

Speaker 1:          00:37:19       tie that like, look, we're ready to put this story to bed, but uh, we need to see soccer cock first. I mean, this might be a big publicity. You know, you should pay a cover charge to go to the shower.

Speaker 4:          00:37:33       That's funny. That's very funny. That's very funny. Bill Burr, I don't get them. I love people that say no, you know, just somebody who's jealous, you know, there's a lot of bills as good as any, anything, nothing.

Speaker 1:          00:37:46       You know, there's a real disturbing thing in comedy where people don't want other people to be good as well. Yeah. I don't know what it is, but we all know a certain number of people who have been afflicted by that voluntarily or involuntarily. Some of them tried to kick it.

Speaker 4:          00:38:03       Yeah. Well Jimmy Brogan's, one of those old bitter guys and Nice Guy, but he used to write for the tonight show, you know who he is, and he was upstairs and somebody was on stage. A young comic. He was like, listen. And like I don't get it. I go, you know what? It doesn't matter if they get it, listen to the audience, they get it. It doesn't mean everything's quality, but give them credit, you know? Yeah, that's a weakness man. It's like the why, why, you know, either like it it

Speaker 1:          00:38:28       or don't like it, but you know, to really like focus all your negative energy like that, those people,

Speaker 4:          00:38:36       they become, it's a horrible aspect to dealing with, uh, with other people. It's like when you're all in the same sort of business together and that becomes a guy who just for one reason or another just can't seem to get it together. And so they start spewing venom and then you're around them. You pick that up. Like if you happen to be working with a guy, you know, and he's like, he's just bitter and nasty, like you can ruin your whole weekend depth. David played in the invincible. He played a character like that was part of the events Nepalis group, the guy who was the football player who they based the movie on. And it was really interesting character because he was so resentful of his friend success that when everybody was cheering, you just see him looking in his glass and stern, you know, like fuck, he got something else in life and here I am at the bar, you know what I mean?

Speaker 4:          00:39:31       But at that played it really well. But it was an interesting cat because I thought about, I've seen it with comedians when a comedian get something, it's like when I, when I started out, I started out with Eddie Murphy, right, right. And I was presenting it live and I was like, I was hired for three episodes and I've ever told you that. Yeah. Uh, anyway, Eddie became a star and people would actually say to me, does that bother you? That I could. Now, do you think that if I, if Eddie Murphy didn't do 48 hours, I would have nothing to do with me. It's him. He did it. He's talented. But what is it that stops people from ever seeing that? What is it that makes people just go, fuck, you fucking knew Murphy. No frozen the movie beavin better to what? Fucking petty, petty and follow me in Cleveland. I fucking Burrito. He was the middle of, I was the middle, he was the headline. I was like, seriously?

Speaker 4:          00:40:29       We know so many of them and those stories are so gross. The I blew him off the stage stall. Yeah. And crushed. Unless they're talking about a decade and then suddenly they become cool guy. Yeah. And you're like, oh, how bad did he eat it? Uh, I, you know, I don't like that guy plates. I'll show, you know, I don't like Bobby Collins. Right? Yes. And then I like, there's only three guys I really don't like in comedy and he's one of them. And uh, I, I did this benefit, it's called rags to riches in Vegas. It's all these rich Jews in the Tang garment guys. Fucking hilarious crowd. They're all, you know, like they'll think they're funny. They're fucking. And Bobby Collins was there last year, right? And I said that. I said, no matter how bad I do, I know I'm not going to be worse than fucking Bobby Collins. Right. And they fucking cheered because he had a tough set. This isn't on the air. I know on the Internet. It only reaches a whole world of people. So it's a weird group.

Speaker 1:          00:41:34       I love that. Um, that they listened to the in Ireland. Like I told you, I'm gonna be in Kilkenny in three weeks. Yeah. Well that's one of the most beautiful things about the internet as he can get shit from anywhere. You can listen to a podcast like London real. Those guys do one from London. You can listen to a podcast from Switzerland or Iceland or fucking fucking cool. Take it so much power away from the man when you think about it. Think about like was my main man. You killed him. Yeah, it definitely does. And every comic has a podcast now. It's like, yeah, there's every comedian that I know has a podcast that funny to me using. Yeah. It's like having a podcast is like having a twitter account. It's like having an act. You can have an act, but it doesn't mean it's going to be that good.

Speaker 1:          00:42:19       No, but that's true. But it also would like, it Kinda, it's like it's another part of your act sort of, you know, Jamie and I were talking about that before, before you came in and I asked him, it was kinda awkward, but I had to ask them, Hey, do you have eye makeup on? It's just a beautiful man. It's eyes. Nothing, nothing. Not that I was like restaurant on them. I'm just saying like glance by, uh, his eyes look like he had makeup on. It's just beautiful. It was beautiful. The um, the idea that you're, you're, um, podcast is a part of your act. I mean it's like, it's uh, when you're doing stand up, you know, one thing that you're selling almost more than anything. It's like a point of view. It's like one of the beautiful things about watching the guys that you get your lock into the waste thinking and he'd go, oh, I see what he's, you know.

Speaker 1:          00:43:11       And then he started laughing. But you're, you're, you're locked into a point of view. You know, you figured out a way to lock into his point of view. Well, it's cool to do something without your act, you know, people get like, you know, uh, I told you not to struggle, but you were, you were because of the power of your podcast and your popularity, you were by far the biggest act we've had on as far as numbers went. Wow, that's awesome. We've had a lot of good guys dot Merera live from the laugh factory podcast Jamie was on today were really good. You're so well. The thing about you is, hey, we'll just give you each a little massage. She always will and celebrate each other. You just, uh, you know, you're the real deal. So you don't bullshit things. You don't fake things. It's really dumb.

Speaker 1:          00:43:57       I rarely they're talking. Some people for whatever reason, can't do that. They get weirded out if they're doing an interview or they, they, they have that hard time. Just completely be in themselves. But you don't know. You don't have a punchline every fucking sentence. Well, you know that, but there's a lot of guys who don't, you know, they get nervous. You thing I love about you, dom, is that you stayed, you always stayed true to stand up. Stand up is always the big thing for you. No matter what you did. Like he would occasionally do a TV show or you know, you'd like, it'd be great if I got a series, but you know, I'm a stand up comic. That's what I do. And you've always loved it and you're always writing new shit. You're always improving. I still love you still love it. And you still come up with new shit all the time too.

Speaker 1:          00:44:39       That's like so important. It's so, it's such a, um, it's like a, it's a rare little sort of group of, of, of people that we know that like really, really love and appreciate the artist's stand up. Does fuck does. Fuck already does. It does. Yeah. Yeah. I went on after Brian the other night at the laugh factory. Hey, terrific sense. I'm busting busting the crowd and say some nice to follow Brian because he sets the bar so low or whatever. You know, he starts hollering and made from upstairs. They know we're fucking friends. I wouldn't do it like, you know, like when I host a show, I said the true sign, I don't like a person so if I give them a straight nice intro, if I'm being nice, just give it. That means I don't like, I don't have time for. And what people don't understand too well if we bust each other's balls and it's really like a pleasure.

Speaker 1:          00:45:31       It's fun. Yeah. Like if you say some stupid shit about me, if I say some stupid shit about you, we enjoy it. Of course. Like we make each other laugh and some people don't see that. Like they see like two comics busting his balls and they think like oh they are asserting dominance and hurting each other. No, they're having fun. And the fact that they can do it to each other, you know, and it's part of being a comic. The busting balls thing is a part of being a competent. Well when you said something a couple minutes ago about the guys who seriously talk about themselves in comedy, like, you know what I mean? First of all, I'm not bragging, but I was incredible. I read them, he couldn't follow up anytime. They should have a music act when they have to make, just to comedy. The lydian stand.

Speaker 1:          00:46:16       There was a guy that he shoved, her name may remain nameless, who already had a website. We were on a podcast or a website and in his website Id, uh, it had a whole shopping college about how we blue dice off the stage following who would that be? Oh, I don't know, but the fucking silly is shit I've ever read. I was like, okay, what are you talking about? Like one of the things I like about the ice, there's nothing phases him Wednesday, he doesn't give a fuck. He did that special he, he aired that, that two CD special called the day the laughter died and he went up, essentially went up or danger fields in New York unannounced. No one knew he was going there. And if you've ever been to Dangerfield, danger fields. When I was a kid, when I first came to New York, I fell in love with danger fields.

Speaker 1:          00:47:06       That was my spot in New York City. It was the nightclub was an all time nightclub. It was off the beaten track. They give you a half an hour. The crowds were very small except like weekends and like sometimes like prom shows were like pack there, but you, it was, it was where they filmed the Rodney Dangerfield, hbo special. To me that was, it was, it was Mecca in New York. You know how I went there all the time, but you, you had to work with some really fucking crazy people. Who is this Scottish guy who was the bouncer owner, whatever. Jimmy, he was a character. He looked like he was sitting down and we understand that he was so squad. He was a brick house falling ball. He was a brick house. That guy was gigantic. Don't get a fucking left for folk sick. He was a power lifter. That dude, he would like grab people and throw them out.

Speaker 1:          00:47:59       There was a gentleman until someone wasn't a gentleman time, you fucked up. Like he noticed he was a big guy, but he was like deceptively straw, right? He would do crazy weight lifting things. He had, um, like cement buckets, buckets, buckets, yeah. Yeah. He had them filled with cement and he would do exercises with them. He did power lifting, did a lot of crazy shit. That guy was stupid strong, but he was perfect for the nightclub and he was hilarious too. He was always going to try again, would that shite activists balls, but it was warm, you know, and it's like he would do it with like a half a smile on his face and he's like, hey man, I'm just trying to do my thing. And he would laugh. He was a good dude, but if you ever got in a tussle with that guy, oh my God, he was terrified.

Speaker 1:          00:48:49       He, I saw him pick a guy up by his neck. He grabbed the gun but in the back of the neck and just hoisted him up in the air, but he's essentially doing it completely by his neck to his prom shows. Kids would come in and they would get so fucked up. Oh yeah. They were so fucked up. Do you remember Al Lubell? Yeah. A kid went on stage, took the microphone away from Alabama and blue cigar smoke in his face. Wow. It was crazy what I'll do. He didn't know what to do. I didn't want to get into physical confrontation with him and I was a lawyer. I've ever. Yeah. Yeah. So he, he, he backed away and you know, I don't remember what the, I don't remember how it was resolved because this was Jesus. This was like 1991 or something like that and then empty to anybody they ever come on stage with you?

Speaker 1:          00:49:32       No, no. You know, I don't. It wasn't his fault, it was just a kid who was like really fucked up. The kid was really big. It was a big football player looking kid who's just a really bold. They were all trying to be superstars. This was like were at danger fields and it was clear that no one really had the run of the place. It was almost impossible to, to corral the crowds. Oh yeah. That's really crazy. That prom crowd is also. So there's one, it's the St Patrick's Day. It's one day everybody gets fucked up and they were tough. He was the crazy shows I ever worked in my life without a doubt, because first of all, you would work from like the time it was dark out from like 7:00, he would do shelf till 2:00 in the morning and then we get off stage two in the morning and people told me that I didn't believe him, but it was like it was good money. Less spot at the Improv used to be 3:45, 3:45 in a weekend nights. I remember having 3:30 spots. Wow.

Speaker 4:          00:50:28       That is incredible. But you know, I don't know if I've ever told you this. The first time I did stand up for money was $50 at Seton Hall. Right now I'm just fresh out of Improv, Improv group, all this shit. And I go up on stage and it girl starts heckling me. She was fucking out of her mind. So I bring her up thinking right. The worst thing I could've done. Then she's laughing hysterically and then she starts crying. Hysterical. Oh my God. Like sobbing, crying. And I'm thinking, man, it's fucking standup is harder than it looks, you know, and I don't know what to do. And then this guy, you wouldn't know this guy, he died a long time ago. Uh, he comes up on stage. He was like, he was a real pro and he just took her off, took an and found out later that her brother's girlfriend was killed in an accident.

Speaker 4:          00:51:13       So she was fucked up on pills and stuff. And it was the first time I ever did standup and he covered for me. He did. He made extra 20 minutes and all. But I, you know, like this my first fucking indoctrination. That is whole new life. I'm going, Holy Shit. Is that harder than it looks? Shit. Roll the dice. Never brought anybody up after that. That's fine. Uh, it's funny on Hart, standup really is. But then once you get good at it, how easy it is. Well, it's easy because you can take your time and you can think like, you can literally think when you're doing an act, there's wrote, it's not, you know, then you're thinking, Oh, if I lose my place, I don't have a place so I can't lose my place because it doesn't matter. You don't care if you go off and something.

Speaker 4:          00:51:58       I, you know, you gotta you gotTa always have things to talk about. Yeah. But I don't know if you don't have like, you know, you don't do the exact same act or not even close and that makes it so much easier because then you know, you're a freak and that's when, that's when I think it gets easy. Yeah. That is when it gets easier. That's why I hate doing the tonight show and shit like that. When they have it scripted of what you're going to say. It takes all the fun and spontaneity away from what's really unfortunate that that's still the thing, those little seven minute conversations. Hardest thing I do. Yeah. Especially because you, you're doing it with a stranger, you know, even if they're, I mean, who's the closest to who you're friends with at all those guys. Craig Ferguson. You mean calling in?

Speaker 4:          00:52:44       Do you do Conan? No, I do Craig and failing. So like even though you see those guys, like, you know, maybe every now and again I really liked buddies with them. It's not like no. Sit Down with them and be yourself. No, but I gotta say the thing about Ferguson, he never gets to a question and all the times I've done, I've done a show probably eight times, never gets. They asked the head of the preinterview and the producers called the segment producers and they're so worried about what you're gonna say. Oh, he doesn't know much about baseball but he knows about the football and. Alright, alright. And then never gets to a fucking thing. Wow. I had one of my most fun moments ever on television on his show because he asked me, he plugged the date, my denver comedy works and I had already done it.

Speaker 4:          00:53:27       I said, well you've got to really crack staff here. I said, I've gotten so hot they have to post, plug my dates because there'd be a riot if they all knew I was there. Right. And he goes, and then he says to me from his desk, look, we'll start over. I go and starting over and he walks over. I go, look, I got a spot at the lift factory. I got to get to. I said, I'm, I'll do. I said, I'll do my little monkey dance for you and I'll come over and talk to you, but I ain't starting over. And we had like a fake fight, but it was great because the audience knew it was real, you know what I mean? And then I went over to the panel and we just fucked around.

Speaker 1:          00:53:59       That's great. Well, he's a funny guy and he's a. He apparently does a lot of standup too, right? There's a lot of standup. Does a lot of road gigs. I know there's been places that I've been where I just said he was just there. It was going there. Yeah. Good for him, man. It's just, uh, I would, I would like to see him even more and uncensored format for hours, you know, descending guy. I've only worked with him once. He in Toronto, you know, when I really became a fan of hands. Um, when he was talking about pretty spirits to remember that. No, what did he say it was, I don't want to paraphrase, but it was right around the time when she kept running into all these problems and it was obviously something wrong. The truth is fucking tailspin. And He, um, he, he basically was like, why does everybody care about this?

Speaker 1:          00:54:44       Like you're talking about a little girl who needs help, like a young girl who needs help. And it was, it was of, I mean said little girl, well, young lady who needs help. And it was really kind of, um, it was refreshing. It was like he was, this isn't, you could tell wasn't something that was like he was posturing and he was making an attempt at saying this because he just wanted to achieve some moral high ground. It was a real like, like it felt like he has a voice, he's on television, let's see if I can just get this message out, and it was so right. It was because it was like, why is everybody freaking out about this young lady who obviously does have problems when we're in the middle of fucking two different wars and who knows what else is going on in the world?

Speaker 1:          00:55:29       Who knows what the fuck else is going on? It was like little Lindsay Lohan. Now it's like she makes the news, but it's so, so weird with that man. It's so weird to fix it. Like to somebody that will knock them down. It's so weird to fixate on individuals like that. It's so weird that. Yeah, we'd definitely like to build them up and knock them down. There's no doubt about that, but it's weird how people just get locked into that. Yeah. You know, what's Lindsay Lohan up to now? It's like once she becomes like this side show, they just. There's a market. It she, because it's almost like she becomes infected with fame then that fame but fucking sucks onto her and she needs it sorted to give her money and they need her and people like her to fuel the there, you know, the little publicity machine. It's fascinating stuff

Speaker 4:          00:56:24       because they also have an incestuous relationship. A lot of times some of these celebrities, they actually choose to get their photos taken, the sure they asked to set things. Oh. And their publicists set things up with to keep them in the, in the chatter we have. Fascinating. We had Justin Bieber at the laugh factory one night and I knew he was up there and you know, he even said a couple of things to me. I was hosting a really cute little chick that he goes out with her, forget she's a singer. I think it's Selena Gomez. Beautiful. I'm sad. I know that, but I do beautiful. But anyway, he, uh, his, his manager came up to Jamie to ask me to mention that he was there. I thought that was so unusual because you know, a lot of times like say Sean Penn comes in, it just wears a baseball cap down.

Speaker 4:          00:57:09       Nothing, not a word, you know, and his kid one, the detention. I'm thinking, how much fucking attention do you need? Like one of the most famous famous 16 year olds ever. Ever, you know. Well that's, you know, he wanted it to be brought up, you know what I mean? Like, like I get a hand for him really well. He's probably, you know, it's this thing gets a kick out of doing that. You can just show up places and people cheer him. I bet he could like do that. Just show up at a restaurant. Gentleman Justin Bieber's here.

Speaker 4:          00:57:40       That's a fascinating thing man. It's fascinating to me that people camp movie stars and didn't give a fuck about the guy who's laying in the alley start, you know. It's like, well he seems like he's handling it way better than most people would. Well, it's pretty unusual. Yeah. I mean, he's like, yeah, he says some silly things every now and again, but he's like 17 years old or 18 years old, whatever it is. You should see the girls, young girls fucking her. You can't say that. I think she's too young. She's 18. She sent. I think you got to lie to yourself.

Speaker 4:          00:58:17       What a girl. 17, 17. You know what I mean? And it's so key to sing back then. Don't forget he was only 20. I semans Christine's 16. Remember that? I was kiss those gene semans was just 17. Know what I mean? The way she looked beyond compare. Well, but this was a gene simmons was saying how he has to have to have you. That's a great fucking song. And if you say it's not a great song, I was like fuck you pitch. So that's good. That's a mature. That's how I handle it. Fuck you bitch. You can't shit on my childhood. And there was, there were a couple of sweet 16 songs. Yeah, there was a lot of creepy dudes back then. They got away with ap with 18 people died younger back then. That's what it was talking about, the Roman Empire. Joe, what it was five, four, zero people died earlier back then. It's a known fact that what people could have said before, not before. Yeah. Before Google. That's a big point right there. A known

Speaker 1:          00:59:21       fact and like I can just bullshit you and there's nothing you could say if he was good at bullshit and he'd be like, all right, you just don't want to fucking admit the encyclopedia Britannica. I read all the volumes. You don't know if you've read it. I fuck. We're in a quagmire here. I can't get out of this bullshit conversation, asshole, asshole. Just bullshitting. I know he's bullshitting. And then you find out years later that he was bullshitting fact. That's funny. Those motherfuckers, those. It's a known fact guys that talks about crazy shit. Look it up. I can't look it up yet. Imagined blend. If you were like a long time bullshit her. Like if you. You're a crazy con man type dude and you just saw just an excellent bullshitter for many, many years. What? How pissed those people were when Google came along? Oh, I know. Like all the sudden, you know, like if they could make up a name of a company, make up the name of a corporation, now you'd go, do you have a website? And they'd be like, no, we don't have a website. You'd be like, Oh really?

Speaker 6:          01:00:19       I was watching catch me if you can the other day where Leonardo Dicaprio is just like he becomes a pilot when he's 79 checks and getting money. You can't do that shit today. So I walked into a bank and they with a pilot. Did he perform an operation too or is that the one? Maybe, I don't know.

Speaker 1:          01:00:36       Yeah, the, the idea that you could like have a fake company and get people to invest in your fake company and then you get that, oh, where's that money shit that those days are. You mean you have to be really dumb. I'm sure there's people that are really dumb or get, you know, the Super Gullible, older folks are living with mental illnesses to get sucked into a weird deals and people that are trying to get a quick buck. Like the made off thing made up thing. I was personally affected by that because people I love, but a lot of people were just looking for people that you love lost money. It's millions. Millions. Wow. When you love a lot of people that are fucking powerfully rich. I know some people jumping around a lot of money around a million. Yeah. The Bernie madoff thing was, to me, you know what that showed that showed that this is a crazy system because if you guys didn't know he was cheating, how is it possible?

Speaker 1:          01:01:25       How is it possible? Because I know where Ms Scheme and there are people still collecting money, so they were. They were teased but constantly. Well, they weren't just teased. They benefited and profited immensely. Some of them made big profits, but there's other ones that lost so much fucking. Oh yeah, that guy just went baller on. Everybody just had everybody's money. I'll tuck that away and just squirreled it off. Crazy fucking sociopathic asshole. And it's just. What are they trying to say? I was handed a bad guy. He's just a victim of circumstance. Probably a psychopath, but the idea that it's possible for God to do that, that was so disheartening for me because I thought that it was more complicated and I thought it was more secure than that I saw that had to do with degree to the people to, of wanting to be quick, quickly rich or you know, and these are people that, like I said, that the guy, I know a lot of people that I care about them, but they readily admit they were looking for a quick buck.

Speaker 1:          01:02:21       Right, of course. Yeah. Well that's what he was promising. Right. And he's promising big returns to a lot of people. Right. It's just a shocking thing. Equity, how much money he was handling, you know? It's really shocking. Yeah. And then the wife's trying squirrel something away and disappear into the night, or the husband's locked up in jail for the rest of his life. Did one of his sons commit suicide? I think so. Oh, Jesus Christ it tough shit. You shouldn't just changed his name. Oh my God. Should have just changed his name. His son made of A. I don't think it was even that, that sun just realized like, no, I think

Speaker 1:          01:02:57       especially when you're a young man and you know, probably grow up thinking that your family is doing really well because your father is a hardworking, smart man and then he brings you into the business and then somewhere along the line they probably had figured out somewhere along the line if they didn't know from the jump and then the guy couldn't take it, I guess. Or who knows the pressure pressure. Yeah. Yeah. He talked about like billions, billions and billions of dollars. Right? What was the number was? It was definitely in the billions that I've heard. I think it was a known fact. Joe. Jesus Christ. It's a known fact, so no fact. This fucking guy lost more money. I'm smelling bit ski. There's a, there will tell you what Eddie Murphy was. Eddie Griffin was saying after nine slash 11, but a lot of people don't even know that they still are gold under the World Trade Center and the subways kept running 24 hours a day.

Speaker 5:          01:04:06       Oh,

Speaker 1:          01:04:09       well, you know, he would get high and just crazy shit. He, uh, he actually thinks he's like a genius and I heard him one night at the store and then who's going to argue with this bit? He goes, we got to stop giving our kids and compton guns and knives and educated like, first of all, who gives the kids a gun? He come here, Jay, Johnny, I want you to have a gun and a knife here. Go, go to school. And he said, we've got to start educating them, given pencils and papers and books like, who the fuck is not going to agree to educate kids? I don't think they need education. They need guns and knives. Eddie Griffin definitely had some crazy times, but I've seen Eddie Griffin fucking destroy. I saw him in his prime when he did his first comedy special. It was short set, I believe.

Speaker 1:          01:04:58       I want to say it was a half an hour, but it might've been even less. A lot of confidence. God Damn, he crushed down around. He fucking crushed. He crushed. And it was scary talent. It was a scary level of talent. And energy that he put out. And I remember watching him going, wow, that guy is fucking good. I remember thinking that. Like, that guy's got a lot of power in his act. You know, it's actually scary. It was like boom. It was so good. So dynamic. The way he moved, you know, the way pause expressed himself and you know, he had like moments like that that make me think like a fat guy just really dedicated himself to nothing but stand up and really went legit and went down the path. He had moments if you could recapture those moments. Yeah, I agree. I think he had some mental issues to, with the fucking busy.

Speaker 1:          01:05:50       It's a known fact that, uh, that he had a people of his ilk, standup comedian fellows. A lot of you mother fuckers go crazy to know. In fact, Damo rare. It's a known fact. Have your mental illness and you'll be in funny. It's not a coincidence. Dot Merera. Okay. It's a known fact. You know, Joe, you deal with to compare. I don't think I see these people laying in the bushes outside waiting to fucking stop me. Eddie Griffin was fucking funny at one point. I don't know. I haven't seen any in a long time. I shouldn't say isn't he? Isn't anymore. Who knows? Might be out there killing it, but I don't hear about them much. I know that he has a funny guy. I just don't want a warm guy too. He's very warm and goodheart who he is a very friendly guy. Part of his deal when he goes to a comedy club is yes to brand new sneakers.

Speaker 1:          01:06:44       You ever hear this? Oh, I've heard. I've heard things like this. I didn't know it was him. I don't know whether they're adidas or whatever it is. It's a big company and he has to have a brand new pair of white Michael Jordans or something. I think it's Nike. Nike, but a fucking hilarious. The man that guy goes, I couldn't fucking find them. If you write to where, if you have a thing where you need to wear a brand new sneakers right as you walk on stage and that keeps you like super power, that might sound ridiculous, but if you were a young guy and you grew up poor when you got a new pair of sneakers, that was like a really exciting thing. So it could be that by not wearing the sneakers until he goes on stage, like he liked, he liked a, makes them feel like with new sneakers on, like it gives them a little extra power and it sounds ridiculous, but I remember when I was a kid getting a new pair of sneakers was like a big deal.

Speaker 1:          01:07:39       So maybe for him he like kept that tradition Joe. And it's easier for him if they buy it. Why don't you buy it? Because I want to change. Um, right before I go on stage, I asked you before it came on the show. Not to be insightful and intelligent, not to have any compassion for people. And there you go. You're right. That's a good. I try to have as much compassion for people as possible, even people in the wrap, our pool game, Dom Irrera, people that interrupt, I can't believe you fucking serious here dot Merera and I, when we, when we play, like we occasionally will joke around, but John Plays very good pool and uh, I played pretty good pool and we have some fun battles. It's really fun to get excited. First of all, we play more than pretty good not to get the same a b player.

Speaker 1:          01:08:24       Now you're consistent like a. for a regular person. I'm an a player, but for a regular pool player, I'm a b player. I just don't have enough time. While you're more than an a player for regular person. No, no, no. I never fucking planning, but it ran out nine ball like you. It's done on a regular people. I'm telling you. I played a lot of pull in my life. I am. I beat. You know what? It's so funny when I'm not playing against you because I get a chance to shoot more. I play better. Oh, tighten up. And then you want to get back on the table. I can run some packages, but I can't run packages like my friends can. So like I have the luxury of knowing Max everly who's like one of the best pool player. Very well spar. Every time I go to vegas and play, he was fucking.

Speaker 1:          01:09:13       Keeps you in the chair and the guy just runs down from everywhere. He's a monster. Max Max, I believe world. He won the straight pool. A championships at the Derby city classic this year. One of the prestigious a pool tournament to the world. I don't know what he randomly be. He runs 100 balls. Yeah. That's incredible. Yeah. He's a world class pro. He's a world class problem yet. And a sweetheart of a guy. He's a sweetheart. Max Out. What a nice guy. I miss him. I miss it too. Who is that? Now we will bill your Hollywood billiards. What was the one before that? We used to go to the gym right off of Hollywood Boulevard. Across from the cat and fiddle number. Isn't that Hollywood billions? Well then we went to another place on Hollywood boulevard. What was that quote? We went to two places for years to play.

Speaker 1:          01:10:00       Second. Oh, I know what you're talking about. The boss. A club. That's the first place we went to. That place was great. That was great. That was a a former athletic club and converted into this giant pool because they had the track upstairs. I used to play on a Saturday tournament there. He said when I first moved to La, they had a Saturday morning tournament. Was like started at like 11:00 AM I made. I made good friends there. That Saturday born into the tournament. That was when I first moved here. That was a great place. Remember they had the like the track along the top event? Yeah. I remember we doubled one night. We took the girls to be and she wasn't named Jerry. Yeah. I only remember it because she was hot and that said, oh, that's. Well that's not sad, but yeah, pool was a great thing.

Speaker 1:          01:10:49       A date, except if a chick beats you check beetroots. Very depressing pool, but there's a thing about a girl beaten yet pool. That's demoralizing for some dudes. It's funny to watch. I had a friend who said, will you shoot my girlfriend because she was practicing a lot and she said to me, I'm going to kick your ass. Oh my goodness. All right. So first of all, how she, uh, she broke and I ran the table rather than. Yeah, it was fucking easy. It was those pockets like this. Oh yeah. Right. It's not like we play on the ball just about fits in. And I ran the table and I go, Eh, so much for kicking my ass. She goes, we're gonna. Play again. And Go, no. Oh, fucking it down. Saying it's over. Yeah. I don't want that kind of attitude from women. I don't like kind of attitude from anybody.

Speaker 1:          01:11:41       Anybody. I don't like braggers and I'm going to kick your fucking woman that can kick your ass in pool. She doesn't have to be rude about it. Swimming and kick her ass and pools and humiliating for men. That's a nice woman who's very polite, who kicks your ass and be like that Allison Fisher woman, you know, she has. Of course she would kicked my ass for sure. Easy. She kicked my ass. Trust me, she's way better than me. Who's the big blue is like a snicker champion and she. She came over from Europe and just dominated woman's pool. In fact, here's the. That's the real problem with pools, popularity. This woman, Allison Fisher is probably the most dominant sports person ever in any sport in any game in women's gender issue and it's not like there's only a few women playing women's billiards. There was a lot of really good players.

Speaker 1:          01:12:26       There was like, you know, everybody knows genetically drag because she's a beautiful, beautiful Asian woman, but there's like a whole gang of like top pros that would tour around the country and this woman consistently beat all of them on a regular basis. She was like player of the year, like who knows how many fucking years in a row. She won the US Open, who knows how many years in a row or whatnot. It was the US Open, whatever the W, Pba, whatever their version of like their national championship. She would win every year. Why are men better than women? Why? That doesn't make much sense, but any sense? It's just a coordination thing. It isn't, it isn't immunity. It can be overcome like women like Allison Fisher, she could beat a man playing pool cue, but she. She wouldn't be at the top pros most likely not in him.

Speaker 1:          01:13:10       It's just a few issues with spatial intelligence. There's something to, and this is like really theoretical stuff. I think something to the way the male mind interprets three d space that it is a, it's beneficial for certain things and pool might be one of them because after the break pool doesn't really rely on strength. No, and the average woman could easily a stroke, a ball about as hard as you need to, you really don't ever need to hit it really hard outside of the brake. The brake shot, especially in rotation games or eight ball, it becomes a big issue because if a guy can really smash the rack, he can make like sometimes you break and you make like four balls on the brake like that. There's that Guy Shane van boning, who's a fascinating character because he's the best one of the best pool player in America.

Speaker 1:          01:14:01       One of the best players in the world. Yeah, and he's deaf and when he plays he shuts his hearing aid off and it's not good because of that. But it is an added element. It's good because he's good. He's. He practices relentlessly. The guy's like super dedicated. He's good because of that. But he's also got this added element. We can shut that. The heat on here. Anything. He doesn't hear anything. So when he's in pro tournaments he goes into this zone. It's kind of weird. Yeah, it's kind of weird. It's really fascinating because it's a form of sensory deprivation and people have actually decided that it, it's a, it helps them so much that people started wearing like earmuffs and shit. Got Real Strickland and I know strictly he's amazing, amazing player. He puts these, these things that like the um, air traffic controllers were giant head things over his head and he plays pool with those lines.

Speaker 1:          01:14:54       Even it off with. Yeah. So the senses. Yeah, but he tries to recreate it. He puts earplugs into. So he puts earplugs in and then he puts these gigantic fucking ear muffs over the earplugs and then he plays. He plays like a man possessed the. Both of those guys, they play scary, pulls them at that level. Pool is madness. Willie Mosconi, of course I've heard of. I'm sure because he was the guy that was the big deal in Philly when I read his tray pool all time high run. Really? It's like 580 ball, so I'm like, uh, yeah. He ran it, but it was on. It's a very controversial because he ran out on a four by eight, wasn't a four and a half by nine trips of a dark I. yeah, yeah, yeah. Luther last smart guy. Who, if you ever heard that name. Yes, of course.

Speaker 1:          01:15:40       Yeah. It was a wimpy, straightforward. Yeah. Yeah, man. If there was money in pool when I was a kid, I would have become professional pool player because I was enjoying it. There's zero stricken with the earmuffs on because I was enjoying playing pool as much as I was enjoying doing comedy, but I wasn't good enough to like we talked about this. You would never have the time because you're too much of a career. It believe me. If you were on a law was a comedian, you could, you could turn pro, but if you could play for hours a day, it's so much time and so much effort and the guys that are playing that are at the highest levels of the game, there's several notches better than me. It wouldn't be like an easy thing to even like do battle with those guys who would take a long time when some nine ballgames.

Speaker 1:          01:16:26       I will. Thank you very much. So that's straight pool. A guy can sit you. There's nothing you can do. It's just too bad that that game doesn't get like it's to me, it's like a form of meditation. It's like if I can get into the zone and I can block everything else out and I can move the ball exactly where I want it to go and I know where it's going, I know how to hit it, I know what speed to hit it and it gets the right spot. This is a beautiful feeling to that. It's a, it's a. it's like a a. you're like enforcing this weird zen state enforcing this state where you know exactly how many rotations of ball's gonna go for. People don't play pool. They're like, should we shut the fuck up about pool already? Joe Rogan, Jesus Christ them for fucking pool podcast. Don't even talk about mma. Okay. Jon Jones broke his foot. You didn't say a word about on your podcast will be. I had to show you my shaky hand when you, uh, yeah, that's crazy. I got this nerve issue.

Speaker 1:          01:17:27       What did you hurt? You hurt your shoulder. I wasn't as bad. Uh, I know. I never heard anything and it's just something in the nerve that chiropractor told me. He said, you know, if it doesn't bother you, said it bothers my friends board in May. Do you stretch out or all at all? And doing fine. Yeah. You know, I dance in my house. Did I do a interpret? Modern Jazz? Do you do any athlete? All little stair climber, elliptical machine. I didn't like where you're going to tell you it is very good for the planet. What do you want a piece of this right now? And May I come on over here, let me see if I do I do the treadmill. I do. It's a shame when you can't tell if somebody ever worked that static. Do you do anything physically? That's not what I meant, but I was trying to find out what it was and whether or not you incorporated stretches, especially the stretch out your shoulders, especially stretched on the road, uh, after flights and all that.

Speaker 1:          01:18:27       And you know, that's good. Yeah. I did the, a lot of people don't start yoga things, lot of whatever I learned from the videos. That's my favorite thing to do before I go on stage. My favorite thing to do, I do yoga. Yeah, that's my favorite thing to do. I've tried a bunch of different things that feel good before I go on stage. Hard cardio is one of them. Hard cardio makes me high. Like when I really do like really hard cardio before you go on stage for two hours. I like to do like two hours before. Especially before, like it was a big show. If I want to be thinking about it, I don't want to give you energy. Yeah. It. Well it doesn't do, it just releases some weird endorphin with me or like if I do like a real hard cardio session where I just feel silly.

Speaker 1:          01:19:09       I just saw it makes me Sillier, relieves me. It relieves me of like physical tension. It just makes me sillier and I think when I, whenever I can go on stage and being more of a silly mood and the Sillier I can feel the more funny I think things are, which is the more funny and you'll get a kick out of it. Yeah. The more funnier deliver it. Yeah. When you get a kick out of it and when you're, you know, you're saying it in a way that's a, that connects with people. Sometimes it feels like too upset about something. You didn't understand why it connects with people. It has to be a and honest, an honest balance for why you're pissed off or why you're happy, you know, because it's got to be an island balance. And if sometimes you know, that weird feeling when you watch them on stage and they're acting pissed off about something, but you know, they're not really pissed off about it.

Speaker 1:          01:19:56       And how that is that mit does this airplane food. Well it's not even that, like someone like, just to just fake it, like whatever it is a fake laugh always at the same time, you know, and I can name you find people that do it. I don't even want to get into the union. You know, when someone's mad for real and you know why they're mad for real. Like you feel it, you know, when someone's mad for real, you know, when they really are upset, you know, and you know when someone's faking it and when they're faking it, it's really weird. Yeah. It's so awkward, too much of an act. And I know a lot of us, especially when you do it on stage, it's like you just, you know, you don't. If you don't realize that yet or you know, maybe you just out of sorts that night could be.

Speaker 1:          01:20:44       You're out of sorts that night and you just have a bad set. You're not in the right groove. I mean, we've all had those over the years. I love watching Joey Diaz because of the jelly is so fucking real. Yeah. There's not a phony bone in his body. That mother fucker now. He's just so pure in that sense. Like, Oh yeah, he's not trying to win anybody over. No, he's just trying to be funny to the people who love Joey Diaz. I think he just, he realized somewhere along the line that he was. He's really good. He realized he really is. Yeah. He realized that he realized that himself and he didn't give a fuck anymore and when he didn't give a fuck anymore, it's like that's when people really wanted to hear more and so all the people around him, like if he had anyone around him that didn't believe in him at this point, they all really have fallen by the wayside, you know?

Speaker 1:          01:21:36       It's took it a long road for Joey to like get recognized how funny he really is. Yeah. And along the way a lot of people had a chance to work with that guy and they didn't believe in them. I was telling people about Joey Diaz in 1998. I was like, you fucking crazy. I'm like, this guy makes me laugh hard all the time. He makes me laugh hard. I go, he doesn't give a fuck. And he makes me laugh hard. And they're like, he's to this and he's too bad. Then this doesn't work and that doesn't work and if you can't be in a sitcom, you know. My agent called me up and he said, you like Joey Diaz? I go, I love him. He goes, you want to work with them? I go, anything? We're doing the ice house, the end of July. That's awesome. Yeah, be fun. That's a beautiful show.

Speaker 1:          01:22:15       I might come and watch. You know what I will say is that I think it's 27, 28. The flavor. Remember in my, my, uh, but was weird. Mine that I can remember. Shit. I don't remember why I walked into a room like I like. I'm like a savant. What days are those? Friday. Saturday. Okay. It's not the 27th. I was running savant. Savantas didn't kick in. It could be the 20, fourth and 25th. Does that make sense? It could be that what's the last week and enjoy the last weekend is that. And there's a 31st in the first. That would be it. The 31st of the one before the one before it. Damn. I'm not even gonna be around. I'm going to be in Vegas. I want to see that. Where you go. What are you going to come on? Go to UFC, UFC gym. Doing Atlanta this week.

Speaker 1:          01:22:56       The improv. Then hilarity in Cleveland. You ever do hilarides? No, I have not. I'm looking forward to the Improv. I think I did. Maybe I did. What other clubs are in Cleveland there? An improv in Cleveland. Cleveland. Think I did. That is one of the nicest clothes to river scene. It looks like a giant cruise ship. It's got everything. It's got to fucking Martini bar dancing girls. A sports bar theater. I did a, one of the clubs in Cleveland, I think it was the Improv. I did it with a half. Ron and Charlie Murphy. It's right next to a strip club. I don't remember. Can I go by. There were markings. My life. We didn't have much time when we did this tour. I did this maxim comedy tour way back in the day with Heffron and Charlie Murphy. It was really fun at. John was feisty. He liked to fight. Did he never seemed like that with me with. We were always very friendly. No, no, not with me, but other people. Yeah, no, no. I got along with him. Great. He's a great guy. Yeah, but I mean, we were out a couple times. I think he stopped drinking, but he wanted to fucking fight. That's crazy. Oh yeah. I was probably in the buffalo demon.

Speaker 1:          01:24:07       Uh, but we, uh, we did that place and we did a different place almost every night. It was really crazy. We were out for 20, 22 gigs after the exposure he got on the uh, yes, after he won half run, one last comic standing and Charlie Murphy had just done the Chappelle show. Nice guy, fucking sweetheart of a guy. And as real as they come and a great storyteller, man, Charlie Murphy kill you in the green room. He'll tell you some stories in the green room and just kill you. He's a natural storyteller, you know, it's a fun thing. You get to bring people with the and stuff. That's cool. But that wasn't my idea. That was something that maximum and bud light put together. We all just did it together and became friends. Once we did, I was just, I didn't know either one of those guys before we did the tour.

Speaker 1:          01:24:54       So it was so lucky that they're both cool as fuck because how fraud is cool as fuck. And so is Charlie Murphy and that's how we met Tom Segura too. We were at the, um, the, the celebrity theatre and Phoenix and Sigora was the opening act and look like they would do maximum, would hire like a local act, like a local pro and they would do like 10 minutes or so before the, uh, the show would start with a half drawn and then he would either be me or Charlie Murphy and I'm the. Most of the guys were good. They were all good. But one guy, one guy was a deck, one crazy guy in Boston was a douche bag. He was crazy drunk. No his name. Every drunk. Yes I do. Okay. Well you said crazy and they all were pretty good but. But Segura just really stood out.

Speaker 1:          01:25:43       No kidding. Oh yeah. Yeah. He went out there. I mean the celebrity theater was a weird place to because it was in the round. Those shows are odd if you've never done that before. And I've done it. He went out there and just played it. He did. Yeah. And I know he was a tough fucking huge. He's a big fella. Not Anymore. No. I mean, I mean it was big. Like he's a big man, but not anymore. No doubt. Be Thin, but he was. He was. He wasn't always fat, but he was big though. He was when he would fight. Oh fuck. Yeah. And he might have a little bit of the Yale and his sister before he slugged you. Those guys were animals. Those guys like those cats. Dad, Gavin's, nox and sox was a little bit later. Kenny Rogers sin. Those guys were savages.

Speaker 1:          01:26:36       They don't get nearly the credit they deserve. There should've been a time capsule that really captured that moment in common and they did. Didn't somebody do a movie about them? Yeah. Yeah. France Palamida did pretty good was when standups shit out. Very good actually mean for me. I don't want to because it was so close to home. I guess it was much more impact. I don't want to oversell it, but I thought it was really fascinating. If you're a fan of comedy, I think it's brilliant. I'll just never forget how they didn't bury me in Boston. Tried. No, no, they did. They really like. You could tell that they had an interesting relationship and Don Gavin gave me a great intro and nobody tried to. They didn't want to burn if that's what you mean. Like they didn't think you were a dick. They all loved. Yeah, that's good.

Speaker 1:          01:27:19       To me. They would. They would think some guys were dicks though. Yeah. And they were green light them. Oh yeah. Because that was like a freight train of comedy. You couldn't fuck with that if they greenlit billy crystal. They did that to Richard Lewis. Richard Lewis hid behind the stage for the audience left. There was these guys, man, and he was one of them that uh, for whatever reason they believe that generated. Well. I'm a little bit of billy crystal, but more Richard Lewis. They, these guys generated a lot of hate. Yeah. At a certain certain Comedians, like certain community. It's like we're like this guy just fucking funny. He's not fucking funny. You know, I heard like club owners say that. I was like, why? Like obviously some people like them, like he obviously has like an audience, right? You gotta like it's from his movies more than a stand up.

Speaker 1:          01:28:11       Oh, I don't know about that with Richard Lewis Lewis. No, no. I thought you were talking about billy crystal and Richard Lewis definitely stand up, but for whatever reason, there's certain people that will love to hate that guy or disrespect is comedy. It's like everybody's got different tastes and that's so hard for some people who are fans of standup comedy to realize that's why there's no best standup, but not always. They know best standup. You're crazy to look for it, like don't even look for it. It's just just just enjoy what you enjoy because it's subjective. It's not objective. Like if there's the 100 yard dash guy because the fastest guy wins. You can't argue that. I think that their guy was fast and there's some guys that all they want to see Gaffigan say anything African says. There's some guys and gals that Gaffigan fucking for whatever it is, he hits their frequency and for other folks it's a towel, you know, and whatever it is it is, and you can't get upset that some guys I could tell like I don't even see it.

Speaker 1:          01:29:12       I didn't see it relaxed. Don't concentrate on that. I know. You know, you just relax. Don't get angry. People love telling me that thing cooks not funny. It was like, okay, relax. It's like you. You don't have to think he's funny. Apparently he made millions of dollars because somebody thought he was funny, so I get too much pleasure at other people. Sucking that is a problem. That's a weird thing with people. They get this weird pleasure out of other people sucking. I don't know what it is. It's interesting though. It's a, it's a weird little side effect, a little heater side effect. It's jealousy. It's a combination of a lot of things, but it's so bad for the person who thinks that that's what they don't understand. Like it's just a massive distraction, you know? So it just takes away so much energy from your own life because instead of concentrating on this other person, you should be concentrating on your own shit and if something bothers you, you should find a way, if at all possible.

Speaker 1:          01:30:08       And that's of course it's some egregious offense or a crime or some, some sort of sin against man and nature. Find some way to turn it into a motivating factor for you. If you feel weak because you see some guy like you know, I dunno, name your fucking book Mogul Bill Gates on TV and he's got a billion dollars in his underwear. You know, and you feel like you can't even fucking pay my student loans are figuring out, figure out what, what the fuck you need to do so that you become so successful. You don't worry about Bill Gates anymore if you don't have to be as successful of a bill gates, but become enough of a person who figures your way through the net of civilization to the point where you don't have to worry when maybe for everybody has their own gradient. For some people it might be just making a living is good enough, you know, for some people it has nothing to do with how much money they make.

Speaker 1:          01:30:58       It has to do with getting their fucking mind right. You know, go into either go into a shrink or doing some yoga or going on a mushroom trip, figure out whatever the fuck you need to do to get your mind right because it doesn't matter how much money you make or it doesn't matter anything that else is going on in your life. If you don't have your mind right. If you're not thinking about life, clearly you're gonna, you're gonna. Make some Shitty, stupid decisions. So you're gonna, you're gonna. Be annoying to almost everybody around you. You're going to fuck things up left and right. Get it together, bitch. Hey talking to me. Not that you don't know, you know, never are you a so you're going to this defined sasquatch going to find. So we talk about that. Yes we are. We can can't talk too much because it is top secret, but for my new Saifai show, very soon in the near future, I'm going to go searching for sasquatch and very peculiar and particular location that has been known for a high volume of sasquatch sightings era.

Speaker 1:          01:31:52       Was there a particular forest that he frequents perhaps is the same? I can't say whether I've said too much already, but we will be camping and will be. We will be getting our freak out in the woods. I don't think I'd want to go camp and Joe. Yeah, maybe not. I'll tell you when I get back whether or not it was worth it. What didn't you go somewhere with Carolyn? Yeah. We went hunting in Montana. Notice I said hunting with no gi. That's because I'm a hunter. I say it so often. It just flows off the tongue. He lived by my railroad. I make my own eyebrows. Oh, that was a. Did you ever see that Bo Jackson Jackson thing, but he makes his own arrows. Oh, does he really? Yeah, he's fucking crazy. He's like a mad man. Hunter and fisherman, right? Yeah, yeah. Yeah. He's a real outdoors calibrator and he's sitting there and that's his favorite thing in the world.

Speaker 1:          01:32:45       Well, it's very fun. You know, the people don't want to hear that because they don't want you going out there killing animals. They take call. Wow. You can't say it's fun. You say that you call that fun man. What's rewarding and beautiful and it connects you to nature and it's very humbling and it's also, you know, it's a really intense thing like making your own, getting your own food, you know, going out and hunting your own food is very intense. I don't, I don't think everybody should have to do it, but for me it was a, it was pretty intense. I like five star restaurants, like being upgraded me to these. All these things are good as well. Yeah. I just, I'm too lazy. I don't want to like pick up a tent. I feel you. I feel you bro. I'm not into it all the time, but say you like it, but I don't like it.

Speaker 1:          01:33:33       No, you just do it. Just I just because I don't like, it doesn't mean that you went to one with Brian. He must've liked it. It was cold as fuck. We're camping out in the middle of the snow in Montana in the middle of freezing weather. It didn't snow. It did rain one day though. You know, it's miserable. But uh, I wanted to experience it, you know, I thought it'd be, I think we're so far removed from being in the wilderness that to have an opportunity, especially with like expert outdoorsman to go out into the wilderness for five days and be like, I'm going, you know, this is going to be wildness. Ari Shaffir Niagen and salmon fishing. We're headed up to the great white north of Alaska. Was trying to get a date in anchorage. Yeah. To go salmon fishing. You get a date in Anchorage? Yeah. We're gonna go, uh, hopefully, uh, go catch them.

Speaker 1:          01:34:22       Fucking salmon time. I pull those women's sector giant monsters. Crazy fucking fish. Fish. She doesn't have a quickie or, and how hard it must've been to eat fish back before people figured out rods and reels and spears. Chili fucking hard to get a fish meal. What do you get a deal? You gotta grab it with your hand. Stupid. Well, the idea, the them swimming upstream, there was so many of them. You could like bad amount of the air. So ridiculous that that was the choice for survival, that they would go all the way upstream back to the river or back up the mouth of the river at the brightest fish. Well, that's nuts that they live in fresh water and and they also live in saltwater. What a crazy animal. Brackish water. Wild fucking animal. Is that a real thing that's been going around this thing with human like teeth?

Speaker 1:          01:35:11       It's called a sheep shed sheet. She said fish. Sheep said fish. Yeah. It's all over the Internet. Yeah. Fisher. Weird band. They're out. They're pretty thin water and shit. Swimming around. I watched the show today about a paddlefish. Paddlefish is. It doesn't have any bones. Some weird prehistoric fish that lives in. I think there was the ozarks or something like that. I forget what they were saying that you can't even catch them with like bait. The way you catch them is by having a line with a bunch of hooks on it and you just drop it down and keep pulling it up, but keep pulling up, trying to snag something and that's it. If you snag it and if you snag it then you just pull it up to the surface but you never like legitimately catch whenever you just got to snag one. I never heard.

Speaker 1:          01:36:00       It's still a way to catch them. Yeah, they're enormous and they have no bones. They're so weird. There are some sort of weird prehistoric fish and the way they got them, it's so strange. They make an incision and then they pull out the spinal cord. They eat them. Yeah. They eat everything. They in this row of of these animals is apparently very much likes sturgeon row, which is what caviar is, which is worth a lot of money and so in order to make sure that they didn't allow a market for this stuff to develop, even though it's legal to kill the animal and legal to eat the animal, it's only legal to possess it's row on the dock. You could only either have it on your boat or on the dock, so you got to either eat that row or throw it out because you can't take it with you because you can develop a market for it.

Speaker 1:          01:36:52       You can't develop a market for it because then the animals road would be worth too much and they would worry that even though you, you know, you have a certain number that you can kill and a day and eat. Like they say it tastes good. They say it tastes like pork as they're saying. When they. They grilled it, they said it because like a lot of people have an aversion to eating it because it's a strange. Like. It's almost like they have prejudices against it because it doesn't have any bones and it looks like it's a fucking billion years old. It looks like a crazy dime. Swordfish. It's missing the keep discovering new species. The. Have you ever heard of the snakehead fish? Yeah. Those are a real problem. They have snakehead fishes in fishes. Is central snakehead fish have been spotted in central park central park.

Speaker 1:          01:37:32       Yeah. Thanks for finishing my sentence. Yeah. This they've invaded in central park at a fuck. They get there. Somebody had to bring them. Yeah. That's what, that's what's going on in have water for a couple of days. Which is the scary part. They walk. Do they walk the walk? Did you ever see that? A special about the Congo where I think that's where they live. I think where they live isn't the Congo. Um, it's the then into Asia and Russia is what this says. Is that what it is? What this article says? They're probably right. I mean, I'm sure I'm wrong, but there's a fish like it. It might not be the snakehead, but this is. There's a video. Let me see if I can pull it up on youtube. It's a BBC Congo, and uh, I've talked about it before. It's really a damn shame that this video isn't like one of those, um, you know, those mother earth or a planet earth DVD setups, whether they're super easy to get everybody knows about them.

Speaker 1:          01:38:25       Right? That's like, if you want to see some cool shit on nature of the planet Earth series is, is amazing. Well, the BBC One, the Congo one really should be just as fascinating to people. It's really sad that a, that for whatever reason that that video is hard to get ahold of. But in one of the scenes there's this weird fish probably similar to snake head gets out of water and start to walk in and you're like, I can't believe this. It's his walks over to another puddle. Then jumps in you like, you literally can't believe what I'm seeing it. Like this is a dinosaur is fucking thing. Just did some dinosaur shit. Wow. I mean, we're literally seeing life evolve. That's what I mean. That's like the beginning of that, right? The ability to come out of the water and walk on the ground to better water. Holy Shit. What a freak. You fucking snake fish thing, whatever it is. And they call it a snake fish. Oh No. I wonder what it's called in the Congo snake. Snakehead fish. Um, the Congo is apparently like one of the densest, densest rain forests in the world.

Speaker 1:          01:39:39       Yeah. I don't know what the fuck that, that fish. It's called naked something else.

Speaker 1:          01:39:44       But um, if you get a chance to get ahold of that documentary, I think it's just called BBC Congo. Let me Google it real quick. I think that's what it was called. There's something coming up for mystery fish of the Congo, but the video won't play. Well, there is also those ones that you've already watched a show. Um, river monsters. Yeah. That guy is bad ass. He's a fishing motherfucker. That guy went out in the wooden canal. I used to think nothing of that show. I say, Oh, there's the guy fishing. What's the big deal? No, this guy finishes how the locals fish. He got an this wooden boat. Okay. With like a hundred hooks in it and they were in this like tipity top one, but, and they're dropping these lines in for giant catfish. So at any point in time something could fucking grabbed one of those lines and hold those, those fishing lines and who knows how many hooks are flying in that guy's direction. And actually people have died from that. Like one of the people in this tribe died from that. He got caught on a hook and dragged underwater. Like that guy is legit. And this is the other thing that he said while he was there, there, um, one of the people are the main people in their tribe that chief disappeared.

Speaker 4:          01:40:55       He was gone for a whole day and they were seriously worried and because they believe in bad spirits and bad omens, they believe that he had caused the chief to disappear. And if the chief didn't come back, they were planning on killing him. They were going to stone him to death. But thankfully the chief came back and everybody was elated because like, but he was like, you don't understand how close I came to dying. Like they would have tried to kill him because they felt like he was a bad omen and he created, even if you didn't actively do anything to the chief, he created the bad luck that made the chief disappear is fucking canoe, motherfucker. What's that joke? It was a stupid joke. But a guy, uh, is captured by these savages and they're going to eat him. Right? And he said that, I'm going to butcher the joke, but I just loved the punchline. And he goes, well, what are you going to do with your skin? They go, we're going to make a cannula out of it. And it grabs a knife. He goes, yeah, you're fucking canoe. That's harsh joke. That's a tough joke. That's a tough job. A from a tough neighborhood. Joe, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. It's a non factor.

Speaker 1:          01:42:11       Did 90 percent of all queries come from your town to have the best one is only two types of things and come from Oklahoma steers and queers. Somebody was the first guy to say that, believe it's some mothers anymore. Guys still live there? Yeah. Still live. There ain't no. Well you can't. You can't call him fag and no more. What else? Thought and revolution. Queer seems to roll off the tongue easier. He's sending like the main Larry the cable guy to the meeting. Larry the cable guy. Larry tights am telling you to suck my dick real quick.

Speaker 4:          01:42:58       Here's how bad my taste is. There's a better manager or agent. I would be Dan witness's name, right? Great Guy.

Speaker 1:          01:43:07       Yeah, he's a great guy. I've met homeboy. I was trying to talk him out of the Larry the cable guy was that was basically trying to talk about it, but the life of a billion dollars. I sit down. I love this character is strong, but you know, you're like your old character better. Uh, I dunno diamonds still pretty well, but it'd be you fucking wrong. Will you fucking wrong. You have to say it twice for rarer bad advice. Stama river coming down on me. Joe. He the wolf has then a guy. Has a guy ever become like really good that you didn't see coming. We saw them in the beginning and Whoa, this guy's fucked because we know. I'll tell you who these killing really good. That was that I

Speaker 4:          01:43:52       was more surprised because he was so shy. And Brian Reagan. Oh, Brian Regan's. Every fund. Yeah, but see Brian, I knew him since the beginning. He was like 19 year old kid, 20 year old. That was an MC and he was just gracious and deferring and not silly at all. It was like a steam. It's like a classic, like tonight show stand up. But none of the, you know, the, the, the ghoulies like all over the place and the character, you know, he's fucking brilliantly funny.

Speaker 1:          01:44:20       He just knows how to be funny. It's his style to his, like his style of being funny. So he's got his own. Brian Regan. Yeah. He's like one of the, just like a few guys, like maybe three or four guys that are like squeaky clean, but that everybody agrees are awesome. It used to be Hedberg, Hedberg dot. Everybody loved Hedberg. But what people forget is if Hedberg was squeaky clean. Really? Really? I loved that. Brilliant. It was brilliant. He was a really an all time great for me. He's one of the few guys that I was to this day. I'm like, listen to his old stuff just to laugh if I'm at the airport or something like that. I still love him. He was on. Remember full frontal comedy. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

Speaker 4:          01:45:02       And the Hedberg was on. I remember one line he said, uh, uh, no matter how much I practice tennis, I'll never be as good as the wall. The Wall is relentless. Like he took like an old expression and made it a really funny bit playing tennis ball against the wall. Like this fucking guy's playing tennis ball against the wall. You never go. When he told me he turns it into like one of the best bits ever. Fucking brilliant. I was just in his home. I go, well, one of his towns, Austin box gone. He's from Minneapolis listening, but he did a lot of comedy in Texas, but I met him in Houston, but they really are big fans of his down there. Yeah, he was awesome, man. He was beautiful. It was really great and finding great standup. It was really fucking funny. What time have you offered me coke at?

Speaker 4:          01:45:53       At, at a, a party in Montreal and he's such a nice kid, you know, I go and I said, I don't do coke. He goes, I'm sorry. I know. Sorry. Fucking generous. It's basically go up for me a $200 sweater. No, it's nice. It's. Janice just said, I don't happen to do it. I'm not. I'm not judging it. He came up to me in Rochester, New York we met for and he was so proud that he was only drinking beer. You know, he wasn't doing drugs. He said, no. I said, so basically you're bragging to me about only being an alcoholic kind of. There is such a giant difference between

Speaker 1:          01:46:30       those drugs and all the other ones. The opiates and those are the. I saw a commercial the other day for a some sort of clinic for opiate addiction. Just talking about, you know, how easy it is to get hooked and all the different people that are hooked and don't want to admit they're hooked and they're showing you the examples of I would like to it I'm serious. I would love to do if there was, you know, I mean if there was, it was so dangerous, but I love the feeling because I don't want fucking. I don't want to be high. Like I don't want to be like meth or anything. Speedy cocaine. Yeah. That's scary. You already know. I don't even drink too much coffee, but fucking mellows. I like, I like to be nodding off, throwing up. It was a sense of music all of a sudden I think already I saw. Yeah. You get to the root of things. What do you like to try heroin now? When you like to know what the feelings. Like I don't trust myself. I don't trust that I wouldn't like it. Yeah. I don't trust. I don't trust anything. This is my rule and I don't tell anybody what to do ever, but that's not true. Why am I lying?

Speaker 1:          01:47:40       I'll tell you, don't do it. Um, I don't fuck with anything that's addictive. I don't fuck with anything that can get you. You don't even like coffee because coffee can get, you know, I take weeks off upon all the time. Yeah, yeah, yeah. All the time that's fucked up. The only time I. I'm absolutely smoked pot. He used to be before Jujitsu, but before isolation tank, I'm almost always do it before that or before writing a lot of time to do it. Before writing. It helps you. Well, yeah. I like to. It gets me into a nice groove. It helps me release my current grasp on reality. I just think when you get an opportunity to look at things from like coffee doesn't do that. Coffee sort of inspires movement inspires me to act to me, to have energy to start things off. But for me the best inspiration is like a mental inspiration because inspiration where I could step away from it all and see it from a different perspective.

Speaker 1:          01:48:40       So that's what a lot of times we're getting high does for me allows me to just like move over to the next window. You know, I've been looking at things through the window of sober sustained reality. Let's move over and look at things from the. Oh look it over here, but if you're kinda high and you relax a little bit, you realize this is kind of funny. Really. And then he start poking holes in things instead of. I don't get funnier at all with alcohol. I, that's the only thing I ever do, but it's one Martini will get me funny. Yeah. Two martinis. Not so funny. It's really a big difference. I mean it's really a bit. It really, it just slows me down enough where I don't feel that fucking, you know. And keep bottom. Oh yeah. Well I can do one is, yeah, like a little bit of a buzz, like a tiny little bit of a buzz. It's kind of Nice to nervous. You get nervous at all? No, I get the only time I get anxious at all is if someone I know is going to be there. Like maybe. But that makes me like usually performed better. Yeah. I'll, you know, I'll be a little bit sharper. I'll try. I'll be a little bit more alert, which is everything, right? Comedy clubs give me a

Speaker 4:          01:49:48       theater sometimes 2000 peoples a lot. For me. It's weird. It's a different sort of experience. I did a trap in Atlantic city and it's the only 2000 seater that I do that. That has so much a meaning for me. I've done them in Canada than. But like my family's there. My friends are there. It's my home and that's a little fucking. That's where I get a little bit, you know? Yeah. I filled in my stomach was a lot of fucking human beings. Stands in $2,000, bucks a lot of materials to an hour and 10. Yeah. Yeah. It's fun though. Snow, better Gig on the planet. So fun. I've done so many different things, but there's nothing like the comedy. Nothing like stand up, nothing like that either as a, an audience member. Like I like a lot of things. Obviously. I like a different sports and like mma and uh, I like going to movies, but I like going to see a really great stand up.

Speaker 4:          01:50:45       I learned. Yeah, it's fun and laugh and be separate yourself from it. I did get excited is still I like when I see someone who's really good, I want to go right? Yeah, yeah, definitely. Oh yeah, a hundred percent. I was left back to the other night and it's funny because it was the comedy store first and I didn't feel like I, I canceled Friday, never cancel. I was just beat. I and I sent, Bill Burr said something that I had been thinking. He goes, I just don't have anything to say tonight. I don't feel funny. I don't feel like going on. And I thought I got it builds saying it, you know, somebody I respect so much and I always find that the comedy store, but by the time I got to the laugh factory I was juiced and ready to go and I loved it because it was, I'm seeing all these college students laughing at me and you know, it's very young crowd and there was four slash 20 year old girls right in the front.

Speaker 4:          01:51:35       I go, when would I ever get a chance to talk to you? I'm like three feet away for 20 year olds. I said you came up to you at a bar last pops, you know, before I report to the manager and it was funny. It's fun, man. I'm still driven by that, that, that ego with showing off in front of pretty girls. It's really that. How much of a factor is that in your factor? It's, I mean, I get a kick out of it. I get a kick out of making them laugh and you know, tough guys, something fucking crack. Like a guy who looks like a gang member, you know, I see him in the fucking just get the whole gang member dodger jacket. So just like little challenges. Yeah, that's part of the fun of it for sure. I just think it's amazing when you can translate to other groups, you know? I mean let's face it, if I was fucking stuck with Gumbos my age, I'd be dead in the water. You have to translate, you have to go across generations. My favorite is old ladies that laugh at me in that grade is my favorite and they see them fucking crying. Like if you see like a girl, like sometimes they get college could have come over to grandmother,

Speaker 1:          01:52:46       see them both laughing at a joke, you know, the first time in her life to do, you know, a seed be amazed. I mean, especially because the old ladies today, they'll like, you know, they were around in the seventies, eighties, you know, and now they're in the sixties and seventies and coming out to comedy clubs like they have pretty God damn good sense of humor. Yeah, right. They didn't grow up in an innocent depression. They didn't grow up in the depression. That's a difference between, you know, our parents, parents and, and these people that are coming up today. Yeah. It's a more relaxed bunch. I grew up with Jimi Hendrix. Yeah, there's, I, I've, I've had a lot of like older gray haired folks come up to me after shows and. Great. Beautiful. Yeah. That's awesome. So there's no reason to not just enjoy yourself and have fun.

Speaker 1:          01:53:30       Like, oh, this is like, we have a lot of self imposed restrictions on the way we view things and the looseness in which we approach things. And a lot of it is just because people have to work, you know, they have to be serious because they have to work all day Shitty fucking jobs all day. It's hard. It's hard to. It's hard to really have time to step back and make fun of it all and step back and look at it for what it really is. Some weird temporary state that could end at any minute. Yeah. You know, it's gotta be a weird thing to be a person who's an old person. It's just locked and rigid and set in their ways and not seeing the end coming like a God damn freight train just rolling down the track and they're just going to get philosophical with rogue act and Conti fucking fucking energy in life.

Speaker 1:          01:54:17       We know a lot of folks like that though. I think it's funny the guys who won't talk, you know, don't they don't talk a certain way in front of women and yet they have no idea that the group of women are fucking pigs. Talking about fucking sucking cock. And Alicia. Yeah. There's some guys that are just. There's other boys club guys. Some guys don't want to know either. There's some guys that don't want to know that women, like some guys want like really innocent fantast choker women. Well, maybe they just want to find that one girl from Wisconsin came here and hasn't been spoiled yet. Tom Or mary ever think about that. Yeah, I did. All right. Okay. Okay. Don't jump down. Don't get fresh. Do you ever hit the whatever happened to give me the business. It gives me the business that ever happened to fresh.

Speaker 1:          01:55:06       I think we should bring that back like don't get fresh. I think that is a nice thing you can say to be. Jamie today is running a podcast. He was holy Christ. Why do you let him on the podcast? First of all, I thought he wanted to come. Very. Summit was on your beautiful man, but that's a terrible idea. He was. He was doing a filibuster. I said Jamie did. He would tell you. He was telling the guests to shut up by. Listen to me. I've been running the laugh factory in 1975. I work. I work for the. Hold on buddy. He kept saying, the pressure shut up, I have a guest on and tell them to shut up. These are fucking guests. He was brutal. So many people. That podcast I did with you and him, they were like, please don't ever bring them.

Speaker 1:          01:55:48       It was like the majority of the comments. I was like, who the fuck is that guy and why is he on with Joe and dom that tells you what they said to they go, we think you're not the majority. I made that up. We think you're funny, but you got to lose the little Mexican, the quantum, a little Mexican boy. Why are you blaming this on Mexicans? He's, he's Iranian Jewish Israel, but what a fucking character that's being really shitty at being racist thinking he's Mexican and it's like, you're racist. You just suck at it. You even suck at being a racist. What do you do the fucking Mexican, like defeat. Even Bobby, listen to me when I was in a small country a long time ago. Yeah, that sounds exactly like a Mexican I hear, but they listen to me. Listen, I've been working laugh factory since 1976.

Speaker 1:          01:56:40       Every year was sooner. He gets younger when they came over here by dad. Listen, I was six years old. I came by myself, by the microphone. I sneak them in my underwear, like, come to Medica. Silly Bitch. Those buddy. Hey, he's still kicking man. Still supporting standup if it wasn't for guys like him. People that own comedy clubs, they're all crazy, but you have to be crazy to own a comedy club. He loves it. He loves comedy and he loves the. This, a few people that like, um, they drive comedy in this country. You know Wendy from Colorado from worse. She drives comedy in Colorado, but a story, she was a waitress. She ends up owning the club. She's awesome. She's a beautiful person too, but she's drives comedy in Colorado. Like she was one of the reasons why, like when I wanted to escape to escape from La, when I was looking at a place to go, Colorado was one of my choices and one of the reasons being that she has like a real comedy scene there.

Speaker 1:          01:57:38       It's like a legit comedy. Says, yeah, she's got opened microbes all the way up to headliners like local headliners and she works. Those guys like she has like a whole like rotation and you know this, you're allowed to do 10 minutes and here you allow to do 15 minutes and she develops comics. She has open Mike Nights. A lot of people forgot about open Mike Nights. Yeah, Jamie still hasn't. It's beautiful. You have to have them. Yeah, you have to have them. There are so important. It's the problem is a place like la where everybody thinks they're fucking funny. Yeah. You know which everybody's socks in the beginning, but some people suck to the point of no return. You see it in soccer. That being gay was terrible. I didn't. You were awesome. No, I wouldn't say it was awesome, but I think I didn't suck because I was already over my nerves because the acting.

Speaker 1:          01:58:21       Oh, okay. You know, I mean I didn't, I didn't have much of an act, but I don't think. I think I always could bail myself out. I don't want to sound like a jerk off and send it in seven, but I'm sure I would think I suck. I don't, I'm not the biggest fan of money today. So I was very socially anxious before I did stand up. But I also was able to teach martial arts and uh, because I had taught so many martial arts classes, um, I had like a little bit less fear of talking about we should have had, or at least you're doing public speaking. I had conducted a class. I took many classes, you know, this is what I was doing for a living. How far did you go and martial arts? When I was 19 I was teaching taekwondo at Boston University.

Speaker 1:          01:59:07       I was a black belt, but I was a windows black I think when I was 16 or 17, so probably 17, somewhere around there. And uh, I won the Massachusetts state championship like four years in a while. Yeah. I want a couple of other. So good for your head to get hit. No, I mean the emotional head. Well, it was for me, for me at the time it was big, but uh, the teaching, it was really satisfying watching people learn things. That's what I, I learned. I really love sharing things and I also learned that in sharing like teaching techniques with people, I really concentrated on my own techniques, like a, I think a lot of my kicks and a lot of my movements got even sharper because I was teaching them to be, but like it was breaking them down and showing them how to do them from scratch and then have like a few people.

Speaker 1:          01:59:57       There was this one girl that I trained, she came in as a white belt and then she got all the way up to, I don't want anybody to get mad at me, but I believe it was yellow, green, blue, red, black. I think that was a thing. She got up to blue which was a pretty, you know, pretty high and I'm means you're starting to compete against people that are there. Other dangerous they can kick in the fast, you could get crazy. And she won this tournament and I was coaching, so I coached her from the time she was a white path all the way to the till the time she was like, that's cool. That's amazing. Yeah, it was amazing. And she was a young kid. She was in high school and uh, she was, uh, she was really talented. She just knew how to listen and she knew how to listen and she knew how to do.

Speaker 1:          02:00:38       Like when I, what I explained she could like and she was like super focused. It was really interesting teaching someone something and seeing something like someone completely dive into something that you, you appreciate. And watching them get better at it. So rewarding to be able to pass that on. I always used to remember like my instructor, um, when like there was guys that were really good in the class and they did something really good, you know, whether it was a sparring demonstration or whether they, uh, did a drill in the bag or something like that. He had his beam of joy in his eyes when he saw you do it really well. Like, you know, like when you really take it, know he would get excited and like that, like you could see it as like, I didn't understand it then, but when I started teaching I realized like there you, you're taking part in someone's joy by helping them create something by helping them create these movements and figuring out how to do these movements correctly.

Speaker 1:          02:01:33       That it's not just like learning how to kick, it's like it's like tapping into this, this area where you have control over the whole package. Even for just a brief moment and he doing that. Like there was a phrase that they had from the taekwondo, a brochure when you signed up that I never forget. Said that it was a vehicle for developing your human potential. So like that's, that's how I thought of it and that's how I would teach it. So when you were teaching that you like, it's like I had an opportunity, I was felt like I had an opportunity to show somebody something that can change their life and I'll show you what changed my life. I'll show it to you and you can do it too. And it'll change your life to you. You will literally become a different person. You know,

Speaker 4:          02:02:17       I taught fourth grade and now those kids are grown up and that's really cool because some of them told me it was the best year of their lives. They come to see me do stand up. Oh, that's amazing. Very cool. Will you teach and what grade to you know everything but oh, fourth grade is different than science. Everything. I mean, yeah, it's different than what you did because you went to people who had like an interest and a love for something. And when did the explorer you were, you were doing. But mine is different. They had to be there. So my thing was self doubt, self esteem. I figured I can't teach these subjects are going to come and go in their lives, but teaching them self esteem and some of the most rewarding things where like I had this one kid who was real shy, he was so shy.

Speaker 4:          02:02:58       He was real tall and he was embarrassed by it. And he would stay in the car and the cloak, cloak room, they'd call it a, you know, we're all the coats and they just stay in there. It won't come out. I go sky, Sky King because he was a space cadet goes sky, you got to come out, you can't stay. I can't let a kid just sitting, you know. And by the end of me just like work in his self esteem and all. He was in the middle of the class, just what everybody else waving his hand. And his mother came up to me and she was really touched by it and told me that I changed his life and you know, that kind of Shit's cool. And now I got a couple of the girls come to see me and she goes, one of the girls goes, Ms Dot Turner or why did you let us do so much stuff?

Speaker 4:          02:03:39       You know, like I said, because you were smarter than me. I said she'd go with me. I said, look, you know, I, I had more knowledge because I was an adult. But you know, kids love of you have more brainpower to me. I know I wasn't dumb. I was smart enough to know that I wasn't. That's why you ran the class. Know what I mean to say you were an easy teacher. That's where he talks real easy. I told them at the beginning of the year, I said, look, I want this to be the most fun year of your life. Only you can mess it up. I said, fucking awesome opportunity. That must have been. And I said, I want to go to the gym. This is one. I was playing basketball. I said, I want to go to the gym more than you do.

Speaker 4:          02:04:12       So the. We were going to have a party every Friday afternoon. Well, I would have. We'd have like kids that would do break dancing and stuff. And Really? Yeah, it was. Whoa. That's awesome. That was great. Did you ever try to pitch that as a sitcom a no, but somebody else had an idea for a couple times. It would be hilarious Sitcom. It seems like a natural. Yeah. You as a, as a funny teacher because you really did it. It's legit and if you really stop and think about it, that would be like for a kid that's like one of the greatest rolls of the dice. A kid can get for a fourth grade teacher at Dow. Rarer for you. Fourth Grade Teacher, she still calls me Mr Herrera, she, she's 26 years old or 26 when I say whatever, and then she calls me Mr. I rarer right and I go, Theresa, first of all, you're taller than me. She's always hot blonde. I go stop with the Mr. either call me dumb because I just can't call you dumb. That funny. Like she's got you got me down as Mr. that's good.

Speaker 1:          02:05:08       That'll keep you from being a dirty bird. Whoa, Whoa, whoa. Stay away. Dom known as since she's a little girl. Let him talk. Call you ms dot rush. Trying to establish boundaries. Somebody said, why are you so young? I go, because I can come on. Oh Geez. That was one of my favorite bits that I mean it wasn't even like a. It was like almost like an interstitial. It was fun to do it in between. Just to kill. Come up folks. Give a little, get off your high horses. Even jokes that were killing you would throw that ever. Nathan Lane? Nathan Lane? Yes. It was like a musical, but a bunch of them. He's great. He's. He lives in New York.

Speaker 4:          02:05:52       It was in the producers. I shouldn't even say cut your fall. Anyway, he used to give me. Houston had a great. His great memory and he wouldn't. I would do that. Fritzy Anderson character and he would remember she goes, get off your high horse because I would go. Your high horses. Come down up here were exalted mountains, retreat for your fatigue. Plateaus. Come out folks out and it was just so much fun to do because it was so physical and loud and was like, we used to kill my voice. What do you call a dog with no legs? Not In, no matter what you call me. Hey, come in. Where did I lose you?

Speaker 1:          02:06:26       Hello? Yeah. Having characters that you can just bring back like that. So it was fun. That was a fun

Speaker 4:          02:06:32       character. It was just like, oh, it was a conglomeration of every lounge mountain comedian I've ever seen. You know, like the sappy songs. I write the jokes to make the whole world smile,

Speaker 1:          02:06:46       you know, that kind of guy. I had a nightmare last night, I guess it was last night that I bombed on stage in a hell Gig and long island. Wow. Very specific. Oh God. Because the long island was a. I did a lot of hell gigs in Long Island. Yeah. You've done brokerage and governors and did the nice places too. But I also did fast eddies and Huntington. I didn't know that. That was, uh, it was when I, my manager, I got my manager convinced to let me be dirty because Jeff, whichever looked at the beginning, you picked me up and I was a scrub. He picked me up. I was an open mic or we'd been together forever. He's the best he is, but I love him too. He's my friend, you know, just a manager. He said the best manager and I love them. But, uh, in the beginning, you know, we were still trying to figure it out.

Speaker 1:          02:07:38       I was only like 27 years old, I didn't know shit and maybe you should be clean like that was back in the day where everybody should be clean, you know. And I'd done some clean sets, do, like he asked me to do what I think I, he asked me to do one clean set for him. So I did a clean set at like, catch a rising star. But then we went to um, um, uh, the, the place that was way out. Was it east side? Yeah, east side comedy club went out. I did a settle there and then we did a set at this fast Eddie's place in this fascinating place to live. And there was a dude named George Gallo and if you remember him, he was onstage and he, it real physical act and he was doing this thing where he would do a reverse shit with a banana to, I guess he would like put the banana, like fully formed on his lips then suck it back into his mouth or something like that.

Speaker 1:          02:08:23       And he called the reverse shit with a banana. And so Jeff, I'll never forget, he looks over at me. He goes, you don't have to do this, I'm going to get you out of this. And I go, no, no, no, no. I told them, I go, these are my people. I go, trust me, we're going to be fine here. I know how to make these people laugh. And so I went up and did my gig material because I did so many hell gigs. That's when they started being dirty again. What was the one he was convinced he gave in watching that one set in this crazy nightclub? Like it was the end of discussion whether it should be clean. He goes, okay, we just got to concentrate on, just go all dirty. So he said he's the best. Having a guy like that, a as a manager just takes all the worry out of like career and handling things.

Speaker 1:          02:09:10       You know, like you've got a relationship like that with God. You love the guy like family and it's also your manager. It's really alleviates so much, you know, is the best. So Shandra, they're the best, but I just got so lucky that I met them, you know, just like cookie faces out there and a lot of crazy fucking people in show business. I mean how many looney toons managers that we met, how many people off the deep end, how many people did fucking swindle people and wound up stealing money or owing money are embroiled in controversy every other year. Lenny Clarke got fucked, fucked. So did, uh, so did Jerry Seinfeld. He got fucked around as well. A lot of guys did. Some agents stole hundreds of thousands of is I. Oh, I'm not getting dirty sacks of shit. It's funny business. We're, I'm Tamera. You and I have known each other for a long fucking time now.

Speaker 1:          02:10:07       Yes. We put another 20 years, 20 years of nine ball to think I'd be a little better. A lot of fucking pool dot Barrera concentrate on his stroke. We still going to shoot tonight, bitch. Come on son. I got two hours. To me, that's all. That's all you need. Two hours. That's what the doctor ordered, son gotta.

Speaker 1:          02:11:01       No, it's for dogs and cats. Go Fuck dogs and cats. I'm kidding. You know. But uh, anyway, so then I get a call the next day I'd been wanting to go to Atlanta and uh, but Friedman called and my agent and the funny ball Bud Friedman's opening this trait.

Is still be a part of a fun thing to still be a part of it.

Speaker 1:          02:11:43       Is that my cleveland the following we got to tell you and hilarity. Then I'll be in kilkenny. If you're a standup comedy fan. I don't think there's ever been more funny guys around than now. I don't think so either. I think it's one of the this. Yeah, there's so many good people. Men, women. There's so many. There's so many funny checks. I think it's more funny chicks now than ever before. Ever before. Yeah, I know Sarah Silverman the other night. Man, she fucking. She's delirious and Schumer. I think they rank up with the funniest checks of all time. I don't know. Amy's work. Bonnie Mcfarland does as well. She's fucking hilarious. She's hilarious. She's very smart. She's a very smart person. She sees things. She points out things and you, you know, they make sense. You go with it. It's hilarious. She was. Yeah. You ever heard the podcast?

Speaker 1:          02:12:29       She gives me anxiety. She tortures him. That's torture. So it hurts my feelings. Like rich did shop to shut the fuck up. Just pleased rich. Well, she's hot or smarter. I'm just saying that. It's funny. That's funny. Podcast. The best comedy coupled by far is a cigar and Christina Pedensky. Christina, you don't know her. Thomas Girls. Wife. Dude, that chick is fucking funny. We did one of sand Tripoli shows, you know Sam Tripoli Naughty show and Sam Tripoli's. Naughty shows. He's never seen him. He does. He shows the Improv and they're not just comedy. There's like all kinds of craziness to it. Stars. They would like. They played some thing where if the guy got the question wrong, the porn star beating with a belt. So this chick is like beaten this dude's ass with the belt and everyone's screaming and going nuts in there and boom. They bring Christina Palicki onstage and I was, she's very pretty, but she's not like a porn star looking chick.

Speaker 1:          02:13:32       She was like a very pretty regular trip. So, um, she goes on stage and by the way, don't ever asked me if my wife and my friend's wife is hot. That's rude. It's put you on the spot. You son of a bitch, it'd be you. She's very pretty, but you handled it well. Said she's pretty for regulatory. So it wasn't like she was selling sex. She was just selling funny, you know, she was going up there and being funny. I mean, she, she doesn't, she dresses like anybody. Nice is. I wouldn't say it was bad ass.

Speaker 1:          02:14:02       Try to be as respectful as possible. Mr Mayor with all due respect. And uh, anyway, she goes up there and I'm thinking, man, I just meet her right? And she's with, she's with Tom and I'm just like, you know, she seemed so nice now for sure. She's going to go eat deck up there. It's going to be terrible how you follow the guy just beat a dude's ass with a belt. And everybody was screaming. How do you follow it? I took his pants down. I want to say yes. I want to say at the very least, like his underwear was. He had his underwear on and they beat his ass with a belt. Like he got fucked up. I dude got hurt anyway. Um, she crush crush. It just grabs it, makes fun of it, makes fun of the whole situation. Relaxed gets two that gets to it on her own due time.

Speaker 1:          02:14:44       Just controlled the whole room like a pro. It's so nice when you see that and be like, oh, she knows what she's doing because there's nothing worse than befriending someone. And then you know, you've never seen them before and you know, it's like those, those weird popping nights at the improv where, you know, like a lot of times, like on those Wednesday and Tuesday night shows like this, some of the people in the crowd will be supporting the guy who was on stage and they bring like 10 people with them. Right? Yeah. You never know.

Speaker 4:          02:15:13       I brought a girl, didn't bring her there, but she was, she lives in Chicago and the laugh factory was in Chicago and I was doing it. She asked me if she could do some time because her family's there. I never even saw on stage. She's hot. Thank God. Not only did she bring her family, she put a shitload of people and she did very well and she's really hot. Wait a minute. She's good. I wouldn't say she's good, but I mean she's probably not like an Kristina's Kristina's class. Christina present split. Uh, she did very, very well. I mean, she's a newcomer, you know, she's really, really green. But I mean, like all it was, was just like me going, yeah, you're hot. Fuck, I'll do seven minutes. What do I care?

Speaker 1:          02:15:52       You know, who impressed me the most? Uh, doing like a pop into like that little aster, great Chicago theater down there was 3,400 people there or whatever the fuck it seats. It's more than 3000. I don't know how many would say it's, it's more than 3000. She destroyed

Speaker 4:          02:16:08       that kid and yeah, she's good. She was funny on the podcast too. There's so many

Speaker 1:          02:16:12       finally fucking people today. This is crazy time. Crazy time. They came back, you know, I mean, fuck yeah, I did better. I think it's better than ever. I. Yeah, I really do like Kevin Hart. I mean, I'm think about, uh, Brian Cowen, nick. I mean Jim Brewer, uh, Bill Barber, David David. Tell Dave, Chappelle. Chris Rock, Louis C, k, m a s, tosh.

Speaker 1:          02:16:46       Just stop right there. I mean, look at how many guys are dealing with there. I mean. Oh, hey Patton Oswald. You can't forget Patton Oswald. He's one of the best.

He kills me. He has a traditional standup. He says he just makes fun of standards. It makes fun of. It's. Yeah, like he does. So when he bombed, he does better than when he's doing good. Yeah. No, he's the funniest bomber ever. He's awesome. Yeah. He's, he's quite a character. That guy. Yeah. We, we live in good times. This is a great time for comedy and you know the fact that everybody has a podcast now. I think he's awesome. I just think it's one of the most amazing things ever that all these different people have something that connects to the act, you know, like you get to see the person, like instead of just seeing the jokes on stage, you get to see the unfiltered human being. You know, you get to see them fuck around with shit. Talking about serious shit. Talk about not so serious shit. Boss balls. Be Silly. It'd be a little ting. So little this little that is it wrong.
