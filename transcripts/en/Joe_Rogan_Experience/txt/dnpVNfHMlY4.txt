Speaker 1:          00:00:00       Here we go, baby, five, four, three, two, one, boom, and that can be only one thing. Avant. Well far as we know, far as I know in the universe. Do you know what they think? What do you know that the concept of infinity apparently as explained to me, but people far smarter than us, is that the universe is so big that not only is there intelligent life out there for sure, but there's humans out there for sure and infinity is so big that that means somewhere in the universe there is another Theo Vaughn that has done exactly the same things that you've done, said exactly the same things that you've said, been in the same conversations that you've been in, down to that pause down to the millisecond, an infinite number of times, and you believe it. Yes. Not just one, not just one time, but an unending number of times because that's how big infinity is.

Speaker 1:          00:01:03       You're not buying it. I'll bet infinity smaller than the. If I had a bet. Yeah, I just don't think that that could for me, that couldn't for me if I. If I knew that that was true, that would just break my heart, I feel like, because then you would feel like everything you're doing feels pointless, you know, but isn't it anyway? Just what you know about the universe. Let's just say the universe was limited to the size of this galaxy. Okay. Right. Which it really could be. Could be. I mean, would you and I, let's be honest, we're kind of dumb, right? Right. We're failing. Oh yeah. I'm just guessing. Guess total guess. I mean, I'll, I'll say some big words every now and then, but the reality is I learned those big words from people that actually understand them and I'm just repeating the noises that they say so.

Speaker 1:          00:01:43       So tomorrow I'm the last person that thinks I'm smart. Trust me. Yeah. We're all mimics. Really. Exactly. So if you look at, I think they think there are hundreds of billions of stars in this galaxy. Just that alone is too big. Too Big, too big for you to wrap your head around. It's too big. There's no one. When you think about like how big that is, like there's no way you really think about it, you just, you just kind of like, oh yeah, yeah, big now, now think of infinite and so hundreds of billions of those, and then they think it's possible that inside each galaxy they know that the center of each galaxy has a supermassive black hole in it and they think that inside that supermassive black hole might be a whole nother universe filled with galaxies. Each of them that have supermassive black holes in the center. You go through one of those nother universe, infinite universes, so infinite infinities. So the universe is infinite and there's infinite numbers of universes. So somewhere out there there's another theo on same haircut, same jokes, same style. Really? Yup. Same back problem killing. It did a scary. I feel like if that's true, that makes the job. I took this one. It seems so much shorter. If the.

Speaker 2:          00:03:00       If the universe is that much bigger, I don't think it could be that big. Look at this. What did he show me? Your Jamie. What is that simulation on the inside of a black hole with design movie, Bro, that it was just. This is just animation, so the idea is you go through the black hole and you wake up again, a baby and Louisiana, America you mama's cuddling. You owe you such a sweet thing. Birds Chirping, but they're. They're chirping 200 trillion light years away. Yeah. You believe it, I believe is a weird word. Do you seal it? It's too big. I don't even feel son. The son. I go outside and I go, oh yeah, it's warm, but I don't feel that there's a thing that's a million times bigger than earth that's floating in the sky. No, I don't feel that. To me, the hard part for me is when they say that the universe keeps expanding, you know?

Speaker 2:          00:03:54       Yeah. It sounds like something a child would say. That part sounds to me like it just keeps growing and growing and growing and growing. You're like, what? It sounds like something like my four year old nephew would say if like he won't go to sleep at night, you know? Well, the real one is the birth of the universe. That's the real one, like the big bang. So before the Big Bang, the universe was smaller than the head of a pin, the whole thing. Right? And then for some reason, boom, they don't know why, but in one instant the universe created seemed farfetched. But that's what the scientists believe. Forget about what religious people believe or cult leaders believe, or schizophrenia x the logit of legit, the Sean Carol's of the world, the Neil degrasse Tyson's of the world, the real scientists that can hit you with the real words and they actually understand them. The smartest people, the real smart people. They actually think that, hmm. What do you think?

Speaker 2:          00:04:53       I think the jury's out. That's what I think. Then I think I'm still kind of feeling it out, you know? I think that I think I could easily get sucked in if I'm not careful to just believe in. I just wonder if some of their stuff is right. You know, like what if the building blocks that we started with aren't really correct, you know? And sometimes I feel like they, some of the science for me, it takes too much of the hope out of it. Like I guess I want to Romanticize the universe a little bit and I want it to be a little more fantastical. Like maybe we get out there, you know, in the secret of that video and there's a couple, you know, angels out there or a band or something or like a, you know, some angels are like, uh, you know, some sort of something more exciting than just, is that exciting or is that just more human like angels and a band. Right. That's like human. That'd actually be boring. Yeah. Maybe it's just me. Maybe I'm afraid to go into that other world, you know, into that other realm. Like if somebody was like, go in there and they were trying to push me in there, I would say I'm not going in there. Have you ever

Speaker 1:          00:05:57       been in a place where you're in a or you're outside at night? There's no clouds and there's no light pollution and you could see the Milky Way. Arizona Tucson. It's crazy, right? Yeah. It's a weird feeling. Yes. The all those stars and you're like, is this up here all the time? Yeah. That's how I feel. I feel like. Is this out here all the time and what have I been doing? Yeah, I think we're fucking ourselves up cities. I've been saying that forever. I think all that light from cities blocking out all those stars. I think it confuses us. We don't, we don't realize what we're in. We are in this crazy space ride. Oh, I think people forget about that a lot of times. I mean, we definitely get caught up in the minutia. I mean, but what's out there in the world and the universe.

Speaker 1:          00:06:46       I mean, I think if something were out there, it would have stopped by now. I don't know about that. It's been a lot of time. It's a lot of space on a space that has to go through. I think that things get so smart that they don't do that anymore. This is what I think. Um, I think that this whole idea about space travel, I don't think they do that after awhile. I think they get so fucking smart, they become symbiotic with machines and I think artificial life and artificial intelligence, they create their own reality and literally create their own universes. I don't think they bothered traveling. Oh, they're just thinking it up and then there it is. I think they make things, you know, I think when, I think this is just a thought, but I think what's going to happen with us. I mean, we'd take little trips, send a rover to Mars and shit.

Speaker 1:          00:07:29       Then we sent probes into space Florida anywhere. You know what I mean? You go local, anything know it can be a big adventure, but yeah, we'd go out to the moon. We went to the moon a couple of times, supposedly, you know. Right. But what we don't do, what, you know, what we're doing with these little tiny trips, it's all fairly close. It's all inside of our solar system, right? Yeah. What we're saying is that someone is going way, way, way further than that, so they would have to be way more advanced than that. What I look at us and I look at artificial life and artificial intelligence and how close we are to creating something that's smarter than us within the next hundred years, we're going to have some form of artificial life that's probably way smarter than us and it's gonna create even better versions of artificial life.

Speaker 1:          00:08:11       It's going to improve upon the design and then there's going to be things that they can do in terms of like recreating reality in your own mind, like sit, you and I sitting across from each other. We're experiencing this table. We're experienced in looking at each other. We're friends. We have a history together. We talk a lot, so we were used to being in each other's presence. There's all these feelings and thinking and thoughts going on. I think they're gonna be able to recreate that. I think they're going to recreate that in a way that's indistinguishable from this moment that we're experiencing right now. So then, I mean, you're human just going to become obsolete then. Yeah, I think so. Okay. Well Dang it. Dang it. Don't you think we are. I mean, if you go back,

Speaker 2:          00:08:56       go back to single cell organisms, go back to second Amoeba or something, the first time, single celled organisms as became multicell Logan's Bulgur and one of them. How many of them were hanging back? No Man, fuck that. I'm going to live in the woods. I'm going to stay single cells. Single cells way to go sell stuff is bullshit. I don't need to see things, man. Fuck you. I don't need a phone motherfucker. I'm a single cell organisms. Oh Shit. You know, things don't have to get any better. I'm like, right, like this. I'm not going to get a job and be a hitman. So if you looked at single celled organism, they eventually became Theo Vaughn. Right? That's a. that's a complicated leap from single celled organisms from billions of years ago to Theo von Holy Shit. Is that a leap to, to a human. That's a big leap. So you're saying it would be crazy for us if we didn't continue to move forward.

Speaker 2:          00:09:48       We're going to. That's a good point. It's going to happen. Everything does. We're gonna improve upon this. I mean, we're different now. People are bigger and stronger and faster than they were just 100 years ago because the nutrition, you know, and those genes now was saying that the genes that people who exercise and are healthy are better than the genes of people that don't like. You literally can transfer some of those traits and some of that potential into children. Rhonda Patrick at something. She tweeted about that a couple of days ago, I believe. Oh, this a mud rats out there that have no jeans almost. I feel like like mud rat humans. Just people that are just smoking their own dicks out there who have no real life. Like, you know what I'm saying? Like I'd met some people who, yeah, they're breathing, but that's it.

Speaker 2:          00:10:31       Really. Yeah. This idea that we're all equals. You've never met anybody. That's genius. If you say that I've met some people that I'm like, I talked to them. I go, oh, I'm like a monkey dude. I talked to your Buddy Eddie Bravo, and that guy is a real. He's out there. He's like a jack. He's like a deaf deaf Jack Russell almost, you know, a deaf Jack Russell, because once he gets going you can't. Oh, Jack Russell terrier. Yeah. You ever been around with the dog? You opened the car and then next thing you know they're. Yeah, they're like sick. Yeah, but well, how's he depth? Because you can't get them back. Like once he goes, you can't say you can't get them back in the car. Like you're sitting there honking the horn. You can't that guys out there. You know what I'm talking about talking about. But I might make a description like that.

Speaker 2:          00:11:20       Jack Russell terrier. That is hilarious. Extravagant did. That means extravagant. He's so motivated. He loves conspiracies more than anybody I've ever met in my life. And he thinks everything is a conspiracy. Yeah. No, no, he definitely. Yeah. But then he gets into it, like, I dunno, it was fascinating to me how he went from this like one genre of life to the next and created a business in each one and kept moving forward. A business. Yeah. He got like, he was amused. He liked music. He started a band, you know, he liked a karate. He started doing, um, you know, organized karate. He liked,

Speaker 1:          00:11:54       uh, you know, what else did he pee? A couple of other businesses. I think he got into a couple of other things. I don't know what the other two. He lost me a chapter 70, but he'll hit you with too much information. Man. It was crazy. A lot of people to Google. I was like, I want to climb through a black hole right now into a shit. Like, wait a minute. Is this guy legit? Dude. The other night to him, he sends a couple of links. You got to shut your phone off at a friends with Eddie on was 1:00 AM phone calls coming in that spot because you will get, you will get a wall of text explaining which youtube video has the right information. Which one is set up by the CIA. It used to be like stopping at a rest area on the interstate.

Speaker 1:          00:12:34       That was like the old Eddie Bravo. He'd stopped there and next thing you know, you'd hear the craziest shit in the world, right? He used to be playing in the background. Now he loves all of it. He loves it, but he's. He gets out, he goes in phases, like he gets out of them for awhile, like he was really into chem trails for awhile, but man, I know he probably won't admit it, but it's pretty obvious. Chem trails are bullshit. Fucking obvious. It's just writing because they can write birthday, they can write happy birthday, Rhonda or something and that's not. That just seems like it's smoke somebody's birthday that I think when they do that they're doing that on purpose, but the chem trail things just, it's just nonsense. There's, there is some evidence that they have experimented with spraying stuff in the sky and they definitely seed clouds and certain parts of the world in certain parts of the country.

Speaker 1:          00:13:19       You know, they can make it rain like a in Abu Dhabi, right? Where they make it rain once a week. Wow. Once a week. It's there. They live in the desert jets up there. Yeah. Yeah. They send jets and I think they use something silver iodine or something like that. Is that what it is? It's one of those pilots, they spray into the clouds and somehow or another it makes it rain. He know when Eddie came, when I was talking to him with any one thing I was thinking about was, do you think that there are aliens? Oh, do you think that robots will get so advanced that they will like become aware and what does he say? Oh, I don't know what he said. I guess I'm asking you because he went off on something else and he didn't really answer it. He said, it doesn't get too much into artificial intelligence.

Speaker 1:          00:14:09       He's more into like, the FBI tried to fuck us over. Yeah. Well he told me in the bathroom after we talked, no joke. He said he had to be a little bit quiet because he thinks that some people could be looking for. Oh, that's so crazy. And it was crazy. He said that all hush hush about the urinals. Dude. He thought that the government got to me really because I wasn't in chem trails. Chem trails would did it. He's like, just got. It's got to be a reason here. Did they do anything to you? No. No. You swear? I swear no one's talked to me about anything ever. No one said, hey man, layoff, bigfoot bigfoot talk. But what are you saying? I'm just saying if you want to know. I don't. I manage this. What are you showing me, Jamie? This is the article about the cloud seeding and Abu Dhabi that they use high.

Speaker 1:          00:14:57       Wow. Hi. Grows scopic salt to level up the amount of amount of moisture to generate more rain. Huh? I could see him doing that. Dr Habib. Adding that. The best season for seeding is between June and August. Huh? Hm. So I mean there's, there's solid up into. Yes, they spray shit and it makes it rain. I find that the moon state, we went to the moon, the moon send makes sense. Delta could get to if you really think about it, like you know what I'm saying to airlines like southwest though, right? I mean I'm a little shaky, a little bit shaky on there. Some of the people are and they're wearing shorts, you know, you get on it. I don't trust anybody in his shorts, especially at church, but um, I'll say this when you like, it's crazy. We've been flying across America for, you know, 40, 50 years now, right? Yeah. Even more maybe, you know, and it seems like it's. We could figure out how to get into space. It's harder than that for sure. First of all, it's 260, 2000 miles, you know, the earth is 24,000 miles around, so a full trip from right here. So you start in Calabasas and you do a full trip all the way around the planet and land in Calabasas that's 24,000 miles. Okay. So it's like 12 times at or something. Yeah. Something like that. Well, we could do that was we these we shit.

Speaker 1:          00:16:30       It's hard bed and not only that, there's no air. It's one six earth's gravity because you're dealing with all sorts of problems in terms of solar flares and radiation were protected by the magnetosphere, were protected by the radiation belts and you know, all of the, the atmosphere of the earth. When you go through that and you go out into the space, you're not protected by shit. We couldn't. We, I think we can fight that man. Well, it can be done. The problem was with biological life. See, one of the things that made it so interesting about the moon hoax there, particularly for me, so it never sent anything alive in the space and had to come back alive ever. They never said they never even sent a chicken in the space and had to come back a lot. It all dies. No, they just do it with people.

Speaker 1:          00:17:14       They've only done it with peep a. they've never made something. They never shot a monkey in a space and then brought it back alive. So that's why you think it could be fictional? No, it's the only one reason why it was enticing to me. One of the big reasons was the Fox documentary. There was a fox documentary that aired on tv, I think it was in the nineties. It was called conspiracy theory. Did we go to the moon and it showed that they use the same backdrop for different moon missions that were supposedly like really far apart from each other, but the back backdrops sinked up. There was all sorts of images that showed different shadows that we're moving at different angles that would indicate different light sources that was more than one life source instead of the just the sun. There's a lot of these things that make it intriguing.

Speaker 1:          00:18:03       The problem with that stuff is that I don't know Jack Shit about aerospace engineering. I don't know anything about it. I have zero, zero education in physics. How Kodak works in space. I don't know how any of that. That's also part of the problem is the images, the images. A lot of people like how are the images so perfectly squared. There's no errors. There's some of the images where things are in the shadows. They're lit up like there's backfill being used, but that still doesn't mean they didn't go. They definitely faked some images. This is a fact. They know this because there's Gemini Fifteen, there's a Michael Collins photo. That was absolutely a photo that they used of him in a training mission and where you could see the harnesses and all that jazz, and then they blacked it out and they use it as a publicity photo saying that he's on a space walk, but that could have been an overzealous publicist.

Speaker 1:          00:18:53       You got to look at everything like really objectively. Yes. You wanted. I, I wanted the moon landing to be fake. It seemed fun to me. I wanted it to be. There's so many things that the, the um, what is it? The Prime Minister of Holland who is in Holland and I met Bazal. They met, they gave this guy a piece of moon rock and it turned out to be a piece of petrified wood, but it was signed in. A plaque was delivered by Michael Collins and Buzz Aldrin and Neil Armstrong, and they're like, this is a piece of moon rock for, you know, we're giving this to Holland. This is amazing. Like, wow, you've given us a piece of the moon. That's so cool. And then they finally wound up finding any testing it. It's a piece of petrified wood. It wasn't for the moon is fake. It's fake.

Speaker 1:          00:19:35       Yeah. And one of the Dutch law, things like that. It's a gift to a control. I say the Dutch are wild man, but that also could have been. You got to deal with. You're talking about the 19 sixties. Richard Nixon was the president. He was an asshole. You know who needs like probably fuck them. Not Giving them a moon rock. Get, get, get, get one of those petrified. This will be full area. Take a piece of petrified wood. We got four kilograms of moon rock. Shit to the Dutch. The Dutch. I mean this shit. They don't. Yeah, I mean actually who gives a fuck, you know, like, you know, respect to the Dutch, but some of the greatest boxers of all time. Really that one spot. Well they're aerodynamic till you ever seen a Dutch person to pig will and also there rick streaming, you can look at their faces are extremely or dynamic. Seemed to travel through space better. Is that what you're saying? I think if you take like one of the front of a plane, you know, it wouldn't be that hard on him. Good to have good symmetry that we were saying, Oh, you look at the Dutch, their heads tall, right. It's like I'm good genes. Probably Vikings. Right. That's probably some viking genes hold the big. They're really big people and they got total craniums space. They have a lot of room in their head for ideas. Yeah. Plus they will. One of

Speaker 2:          00:20:47       the first people to say who gives a shit about weed? Everybody used to go to Amsterdam to get high. Well the problem with Amsterdam is there's those trains, there's people on bikes. It's like the worst place to walk around high because there's so many forms of transportation going on. There's fucking people traveling by Cro. Like I tripped out there man. Right. This is like boats. There's a way to have both people get on boats and shit did I showed up there one time and they had to um, gay pride weekend, you know, and I didn't know it and they had like a lot of homoerotic like boat floats going Bolick just single men just dance day it. I was like, I didn't know. I thought that was just, these people were like, Hella Dutch. Gay people know how to do it. Oh yeah. They party mailing, holding them back.

Speaker 2:          00:21:33       There's no Yang or you know, whichever one it is. They're all Yang. Yeah. It's just people Yang in each other's seems. Yeah. I ended up just and each other. I know that's happening in space, in space somewhere. This gay people, they can get pregnant to get each other pregnant and they're gay because how? Because the different guaranteed. Oh, you think that? Oh yeah. One hundred percent. There's gay pride. Whoa. Jamie just pulled out what it was brown and I thought, Holy Shit. I got one 10th of one percent get just from looking at that as aerodynamic as a king. Get it, boy. And no one has a shirt on. It was a couple of guys with life preservers. No one has a fucking shirt. I'll look how gay this is. This is hilarious. They're all buffered shit. There's one girl with her hand on her forehead and the front of the book on what?

Speaker 2:          00:22:20       In the fuck. I can't get no dick. She's like, her friend tells me you've got to get down here. There's a thousand men with no shirt on and they're all hot. Oh my God. I'm there. I'm there. I'm going to get us ride on the boat. An hour into the boat. She's got her hand and I had fucked me. They're all gay. And that kind of slipped this too on the right if you could see that. I think so, yeah. One of his hips a little higher. I have that display show and it's popular in people that have that. And also Australia. No, you think he's just like standing on something that could be just to stop moving. Fine. Seemed like he feels self conscious about his legs he has on patients. It's hot out there. You don't think so maybe, right? Like you can't squat anymore.

Speaker 2:          00:23:02       Oh yeah. Dude, I'm in that bad back club man. It's hard when you get that. I just had a just, I think God just put like a week spine and me and so when I was 27 I was paint. I was painting a wall and I lean for like maybe 40 minutes leaning out with a paint thing and when I lean back in my back wasn't right anymore. That was it. And it's been bad ever since. Really? Yeah. I'd have part of my vertebrae. Somebody. This man took it out at Cedar Sinai. Man. He took it out. Yeah. What did he do it? Did you know him first? Met Him through insurance, but he got it and they and I've been. It's been hit or miss since then. What's he doing with it? Oh, I don't know. They can't afford to go back and see them again. It's 7,500 bucks. You can go to them.

Speaker 1:          00:23:46       It's like I got a scam. That's a scam. Want to talk to me? You sit on that side of the day and $7,500 for your time starts now you're back. Yeah. Okay. Next person. Is it like a disc or a piece of the actual bone? Like what was it? It's a disc. They got photos of it. I don't know if they're real, you know, that'd be crazy part the moon landing. Well here's the data, here's the credit. Put you under and said, yeah, we fixed it, bro. Give me that money. Oh, 100 percent. And then in my head, you know, cause I'm probably about 60 percent gullible sand. Yeah, I think so the more I look back at my life and kind of charted out, went up and gullible and when I happened, what's the biggest one that you look back and go, ha, fuck that.

Speaker 1:          00:24:31       I believe that. Um, I would say probably real overall religion. Probably when I was super religious when you were a kid. I wasn't super religious, but I, you know, I just wanted it all, like everything, like in the bar, you know, I just wanted it to be real. Yeah, I guess I wanted it to be real. Right. It just made it hard. It made it tough for some other things. You know, you're like, first it was like, fuck, I gotta remember all this shit. Like I can't remember. I'm not going to be able to be accepted by God or something because I can't even remember what's in this book. You know, like I'm going to need to hire a tutor just to be, go to heaven, you know, like, because the Bible is bro, it's not the best book. Well it was really good when it was written yet.

Speaker 1:          00:25:19       It's like trying to watch a movie from the 19 thirties. You'd be like, look at this Corny fucking acting. Yeah, right. Yeah, yeah. You know what I mean? I mean there's nine chapters about livestock. Like it gets, it gets, it gets held risk, a in the middle. Really read the whole thing cover to cover and I haven't read any of it in a long time. Yeah, I read it when I was in, when I was in, I guess I was, I was living in Florida, so I was 11. Oh, that's a good time to read them out in school and I remember my parents being a little disturbed, but because I'd gone from a Catholic school and the first grade my mom split up with my dad, my mom shacked up with my Stepdad who was a hippie. She kind of became a bit of a hippie too and we fell way out of religion.

Speaker 1:          00:26:03       So the Catholic church and all that stuff was a thing of the past. Was that pretty cool? The hippie Stepdad. He's a good guy. Very nice guy. It was weird, you know, he had long hair and shit, like long hair, like down to the middle of his back and so like, like crazy. Would you ever like see him from behind? I think it was like a woman or something from Pharrell. Well because he was muscular, you know, he looked like a man, but he's a man with long hair. Yeah. But um, you know, uh, when I was in high school, well not high school, I guess it was in a great school. So what is 11? What grade is that? Depends on how smart you are. Really Great. Fifth Grade. Yeah. Depends on how smart you are. You know what I was reading? This is how great Ronan Farrow, you know Woody Allen and I'm the guy who wrote that article.

Speaker 1:          00:26:50       Yeah. Yeah. He's not really woody Allen's kid. By the way. Look at that kid. Look at Frank Sinatra. Holla at your boy. Say that kid is Frank Sinatra's kid. One thousand, 1 million percent because mia farrow used to bang Frank Sinatra. Oh really? They had a freak. Look, I know. Look, come on. Get the fuck Outta here. Look at it. First of all, handsome men. That Ronan Farrow. Handsome man. Yeah, that is God dammit. That is Frank Sinatra's kid. One billion. Trillion percent. You better stay the fuck away from 23 and me out that. Yeah. Look at that 23 and we'll just send back the song. New York, New York when he was 11. This how smart this guy is. When he was 11, he was taking college courses. Oh my God. 11 nerd alert. That's what I read. Makes sure that's true. I don't want to write an article about me. Spirit of bad information, but so they had a freak relationship anyway when they were together.

Speaker 1:          00:27:56       That was their only biological kid and it's not really their biological kid. Why not? Because it's fucking Frank Sinatra's kid started college at age 11. Wow. He says he fell apart while pursuing the Harvey Weinstein Story. What do you mean he fell apart? Probably because it was so dark. Oh, I mean, come on, man. Do you remember before that story came out? Everybody knew that guy was a creep. Right? But it was like this thing about like, like more door, you know, like he lives, you know, lived in Iran, lives under a rock somewhere. Everybody knew he was a creep. You, everybody had heard stories. But this guy, he graduated at 15 from college. Oh my God. Why does he keep saying the son of Mia Farrow and Woody Allen? It should say wink, wink, nudge, nudge. But that's crazy though. They're trying to push that so much. You know, the son of Mia Farrow and Woody Allen.

Speaker 1:          00:28:48       Well, he was raised by them for a little while until he started banging his sister. I'm like, God, yeah, that's a freak household. And then the dark arts out here, Hollywood's got the darkest arts, Bro. They lived in New York. Well even New York, Hollywood, because some of it's the same thing. New York, Hollywood. Hollywood is just show business. Yeah, show business. That's what I mean. Well, there's definitely something to that because how about that composer that turned out to be even more of a fucking asshole and Harvey Weinstein, this is one composer that was just fucking all these young boys and if you didn't fuck him and they just. They recently got rid of him, but he was just running things through sex and you know, he just basically had a sex cult going on. Find out who the fuck that guy was. But he was a cherished famous loved composer and it turned out this. This dude was running the freak show behind the dirty, just not just being

Speaker 2:          00:29:42       dirty, but that was the way to get in and if this guy is shut you down, you were shut down forever. You weren't working anymore. So he was like the. He was the gatekeeper kind. He was like a Harvey Weinstein of music team, like what Harvey Weinstein was doing to those actresses is he would try to fuck them. They'd get mad at him and he would blackball them. He would say, you're not working anymore. You're too difficult to work with, and then he would shut their careers down. All these different. These different women found out like when they, their careers fell apart, they found out that was going on. There is what happened. What happened. See, that's dirty man. Oh, him, Huh? Yeah. From the met James Levine. Sexual abuse claims. Yeah. Well this is from December 2017, but that has been. It's been. There's recent stuff put up, pull up a sexual abuse James Levine because the more recent stuff is much more confirmed, like a bunch of people came out and we had to do it in our neighborhood named Mr Lang and Stein and he used to invite us over to a chill out and shit, but we didn't know he was that he was a pedophile, but you didn't know how to try now.

Speaker 2:          00:30:51       He ended up going to jail for it. So you're hanging out with them for awhile and you didn't know. Yeah, we met him at school. We thought he was just as cool old dude who like to smoke pot, right with children. And one time he bought us some steaks because he would like, you know, treat us nice, you know, and b, he would take us. He took us to Marilyn Manson, me and my best friend, he took us to Marilyn Manson. We were like 15. We couldn't even get in. It was 18 year old show. And how old was he? He was probably 70. So, and he had like a red convertible, you know, and that's, everybody wants to be in a convertible and so we got in and we went and um, anyway, he, you know, he would, he got us some stakes one time in the state, come with baked potato side item.

Speaker 2:          00:31:32       So we had a sour cream on this, on the baked potatoes and my buddy was in and my buddy was in the kitchen and he said, hey, I'm out of sour cream, can I have some of yours? And I said, no, but you can have. So in my sweet cream, you know, just making like a joke about semen and then big and style and the dude goes, can I have some? And that's when all the fucking wheels turned and you realized, oh no, I'm just sitting there with a mouthful of potato. Like fuck it. He was just a nice man. And you were thinking that this, this whole time it was just setting you up? Yeah. And my buddy, that was the biggest thing, I was so concerned, like I brought like for my friends over there and I was like, what has been going on? I had a similar situation, guy named Walter. Yeah. We used to go fishing and he would run around the pond and he was um, he mentally handicap? No, no, he was, he was a teacher and he got fired when I was trying to explain to us that he had uncommon unconventional teaching methods and that they didn't understand his teaching methods and that

Speaker 1:          00:32:40       they fired him. Oh. So then he's like, he's like the, he's like, it was a very smart guy and two kids, he probably seemed like the cool guy because he's like unconventional and he was always jogging, you know, was always, always jogging around this part. Oh yeah, that's a gay, straight bi. And he would sit, he would combine hanging out with us. So we'd be fishing, we'd be hanging out the spot and he come by, sit with us for a little bit, then take off. So we became friends with this guy. I went over his house once and I'll never forget I ate at his house. It was just me and him too. And he didn't do anything but went to the bathroom and uh, I guess I was 13 somewhere around there, somewhere around 13 at the time. So while day is a susceptible age?

Speaker 1:          00:33:21       Yeah, for sure. And I, uh, I went to use the bathroom and I peed and I guess he was in the bathroom with me and afterwards he said something to me, he goes on, he had this weird way of talking and he's like, I didn't know you were showed developed again. I was like, what? And I was, I was thinking about it. I'm like, I was talking about with Dick, but he wasn't flirting with me. It wasn't weird. It just was like, he was just talking about my dick being developed, you know, like a curator, like an art curator or something. No, it was just, it wasn't, it was weird, but it wasn't dangerous. But then it got dangerous because I'd been friends with this guy for months. Right. For months we have been going fishing and he had been coming to this lake. There's two places.

Speaker 1:          00:34:03       There was a, there was um, Jamaica pond, which was all in all, this was in Jamaica Plain. And so there was, Jamaica pond was this one spot and there was another pond that was nearby that was a smaller place that was more secluded, but it had like good pickerl fishing pickles, like a small northern pike looking creature. And so I was fishing there and pick her up and stop coughing. So he shows up drunk. That's when it got really weird. And he told me he loved me. And uh, the academy say it. Did he say it? He, yeah, he said it like he was behind me, like sitting down and I was fishing hot dude that's making me. He goes, he goes, you know, Joey, you know, I love you. And he was like, probably in the sixties, right? And I go, I like you too, man.

Speaker 1:          00:34:50       I was like, weirded out. I didn't know what to do because he was drunk, like definitely drunk goes, there can be no love without sex cheap. That's what he said. And I went, what? And I remember I had a Swiss army knife in my pocket and I put my hand on the Swiss army knife. And uh, I remember saying something like, man, you better leave me the fuck alone. Like something along those lines. Wow. I've got him pulled the knife out because I was 13 years old. He was a pretty big guy. I was like, even if I pulled his knife out, am I really going to be able to stab him seven or eight times? Is this Guy gonna beat me to death and fuck me, you know what's going to happen here? But he left me alone. He left me alone. But then he wrote a letter to my house. So he found out where I lived. Yeah. And he probably had to get drunk to come there and do that to be able to even say that to you. That's probably why I did it. Like he was probably trying to figure out a way to work his way up to molesting me. So I think that's probably why he got fired from school. Yeah. Yeah. Do you feel a little bit bad that he had led them on?

Speaker 1:          00:36:04       I was a little cutie DNA. It's a kid. But did you feel a little bit bad that he had kind of taken advantage of like, like fuck, now we can't kind of be free, like you know, like you think in ia that was. I did enjoy talking to him because he was telling me about things like he knew a lot of things about life. He was definitely a very educated guy. So before the drunken weirdness and the just the general, it just got more. The more comfortable he got with us, the more I realized that this guy was, he was attracted to children and he was trying to fight it off. I think, you know, I think a lot of people that are pedophiles are extremely embarrassed by it. Oh, it's a sickness man. Yeah. Yeah. I don't think it's something anybody chooses to do unless they're trying to start like a track team or something like maybe in the Philippines or south.

Speaker 1:          00:36:51       Well I ran into my friend Josh and I told him immediately because Josh used to go fishing with me and we both knew that guy and I explained to him the whole deal and he was like, fuck. And so he was scared too. He was like, dude, I'm gonna stab that fucking guy. And Josh went extra hard. He went extra hard, like, Oh, aggression and anger because his parents were lesbians. Oh, he had two parents are lesbians. So he wanted, I think he wanted me to know that he wasn't gay. Right. And it was mom's gay, right? I mean, so it was like all fucked up. Fuck it, you know, that kind of shit. Like whoa down. Yeah, this gay. Yeah. Yeah. This has to stop. Yeah. He was like fucking sword up in his warehouse. That is not happening. I don't think he called him a faggot.

Speaker 1:          00:37:35       I think I made that up. I literally barely remember because I was 13. I do remember him saying that though, that there could be no love without sex because I remember like, what? That's crazy what a gateway line to dude, if you're a pedophile, like I'm glad I don't have that, that element, man. It's got to be so tough to be, you know, hanging around kids and also like, you know, want to like, you know, talk to them about dates or stuff. What's the incurable one? Two. There is no cure for that. Like the. I mean, unless they can rewire your brain, your brain with Iowasca and Ibogaine electric shock therapy. I don't know. The recidivism rate is super high for people that are child molesters. What does that mean? People that do it again, man, you know, it's really high when kids are. It's also something you can't even talk about. Like say, imagine if you have like a mental illness that makes you prone to violent outbursts, but you got it under control and

Speaker 2:          00:38:36       you never actually hurt anybody. You know, you never actually heard anybody but you understand you have this problem. So you take medication and people go good for you. You know, I go to therapy, I have anger management issues, but I go to therapy. People are like, oh, that's cool man. Cool. You keep it under wraps. But if you say I want to fuck kids, but I never have. Yeah, no way. No way, dude, everybody wants to put a bullet in your brain that you can't work here. You can't shop here. I don't do it, but I want to know like what? What you want to. Yeah, but I don't do it because I know it's wrong or not good enough. That's not going to fly. Not good enough because we all want to have kids and like are, you know, we all want to procreate in that.

Speaker 2:          00:39:12       Really. I think that that just, that's gonna irk. Anybody that wants scares people. Yeah. It's the scariest thing ever. The thing that you could leave your kids out and someone could snatch them up and fuck them and kill them and they kill them a lot of times because they don't want the kids to tell. And a dark, dark, worse man and then. Yeah, I can't imagine that. Dude. I remember one time I never had anything like that happened about. I took some mushrooms one time to a, a party in high school because I grew up in an area where you could just get mushrooms. Psychedelic mushrooms grew on everything. They grow on your fucking cousins back. If he took a long enough nap and you can pitch, you grow up in Louisiana, grew everywhere out there because everybody had something shitting in their yard and then it would rain every single day for about a half hour.

Speaker 2:          00:39:58       Right. So it was just. I mean, you see people picking them and eating them and families out there and join them in the afternoon. I mean it was. Everybody was, oh, it was psychedelic heaven. So we would ride out and go get them. I remember one time getting a trash bag of probably about 35 pounds of mushrooms. Right? So we picked all day and one time a golden retriever came running at us across this field and we thought he was pissed because we were tripping and then he got to us. We ran for like a half mile. He got to is oddly, we're crawling away from thinking he's evil and he fucking loved us and licked mean golden retriever. We thought he was mean bras because the hair, his hair was kind of slicked back. Oh look, an evil golden retriever. Yeah. Like in that movie, sometimes they come back.

Speaker 2:          00:40:40       Have you ever seen that, that Stephen King movie, it was kind of like that kind of hair, pet cemetery? Which ones? Sometimes they come back. The Nea? No, it's about men that show up back at a high school and they all died years earlier in a car accident and they show back up. It's like a Stephen King when I think it was just made for TV. When did that one come out? It may be 18 years ago. Has there ever been a dude who wrote more awesome horror movies and books and Steven fucking King? No. No. Not that published them. Unless somebody just has them all at their house. Sometimes they come back, hit me. He's the king of those kinds of movies, man. Yeah. Not even close. Tim, what's his name was Tim Matheson, who I interviewed one time. Really Nice man. You did? What'd you interview him for? He had a new movie coming out. I can't remember. It was called, but sweet man. I bet he got a lot of posts over the years, but he didn't talk about

Speaker 1:          00:41:35       because he's got that safe man. Look safe, man. Look, I think a lot of ladies. Oh yeah, he's got that. He's got that kind of sexy, but also safe that Matt Lauer look. Yeah, yeah. Maybe it's got that mailer. You think about Lauer's dirty. What was definitely dirty. See he's got that cheap Michael Land and he's got that cheap. Michael Landon going right there. It looks like it could be a little bit of native American. Looks like a generous right there. It looks like a little bit of guys went up. A little bit of lesbian and this one too generous with the smile. There's the animal house picture above it. Oh Man. How good was he? An animal house. So good. What a movie that was. I watched that again a few years back. I hadn't seen in forever. Fuck. That was a good movie, but there's some shit in that movie you could never get away with today.

Speaker 1:          00:42:21       Now never. There's a scene where the girl's passed out and whose car was it? John Balloon knows whose character was thinking about fucking her while she was blacked out. You remember that scene? There's a scene in it. Yeah. The girl, she takes her gum off, she pulls her bra. Who is that guy? Why don't you get them in their mouth or they're about to fuck you ever notice that they don't want bad breath. Yeah. So, uh, there's a devil on his shoulder and then the angels on his other soul, she blacks out with their titties out and the devil is like, fucker, fuck her fucker fucking brains out. And then the angels like, don't do it, don't do it. But the fact that this is in a movie where they're essentially debating whether or not he should rape her now she was willing to have sex with them just moments ago.

Speaker 1:          00:43:10       But she's clearly unconscious and clearly not able to consent. I mean, she was black. The fuck out. She, she was totally down for it. So he's holding onto cotton that was in her bra and she just blacked out and fell asleep. Cup, bonk. And he's popped out. You would never have this scene in a movie today. People would be outraged. They would, they would say the direct you are Roman Polanski, piece of shit. You're a fucking molester. You're a monster, you're an abuser. Yeah, but do you think that still. That still happens though? Well, that kind of thing definitely happens for sure. People do all murder. Murder still happens. I remember there was a school shooting today in Texas. I mean horrible things happen, but the point is like that kind of scene in the movie, in a comedy movie you could never do today, but they say that our code, so that makes me think like they say art imitates life, but if it doesn't really imitate life anymore than it's just are we are we, you know, it just.

Speaker 1:          00:44:08       Yeah, like what are we making? The thing is that in a comedy and that's the, the lead of the story or one of the heroes of the story, that guy in that scene, you would not want the hero of the story to do something so horrific and something that you can laugh at because you would have to be judging him by his crime and we all agree that that's a crime. Now what is this I see from meatballs. What does this have to do with as it gets to in here? Bill Murray starts doing the same kind of thing with the girl. Oh, that's a girl. Oh. Oh. He's trying to rape her while he's trying to be sexually aggressive. Is that what it is? We're wrestling around being sexually aggressive. Is the new. Is that thing? He was throwing himself at her and she got out of the way.

Speaker 1:          00:44:49       Even jerk off. I. I drive out to Riverside to jerk off, man, you can't even jerk off in la anymore without having a lawyer on retainer. But nuts are on contingency. I felt like. I just feel like it's so dang injuries. You imagine if it turns out that you're some sort of a sex criminal for jerking off to a certain type of thing. Like what if you're into. What do they find out? You're into girls getting tied up, jerk off to videos of girls getting tied up and fucked like what kind of tied up like scary or like again, like snm shit. Just. It was just like my scouts of America type of shit. I was reading this thing about this guy who got arrested for child porn. They wanted them for something else. They caught him and arrested him for child porn and like there's also some suspicion attached to it accusations, but all you have to have is have child porn.

Speaker 1:          00:45:42       You don't have to be a child molester, you just have to have the images and you're a bad guy and you're the worst. You're going to jail like it's one of the few things you could have on your laptop. They can come over your house, your house. They checked feel Vaughn's laptop and there's 100 videos from Isis and then and chopping heads off with dull knives, stabbing them. The next shooting, I'm lighting them on fire. Nothing happens to nothing. One video of a kid that looks under age getting fucked and you're going to jail, just a video, not you doing anything but you being in possession of that kind of crime. So we, we make big differentiations, right? We've really clearly differentiate between some crimes that you can have on your computer in a video form like murder, which you could download on live leak or 100 different websites.

Speaker 1:          00:46:34       Right? You can get videos of people getting murdered. Yeah, and you can watch it almost every night on television, like in a kind of specially packaged way where it's really is about the murder, but it's not, you know, and all these shows. The fake stuff. Yeah. You watched fake stuff. I mean you can definitely, definitely watch fake rape. Rape and movies were horrific scenes, but if you have that on your computer and it's child porn, you are going to jail. It's one of the only things would if it's drawings of that. That's a good question. There's a, there's a real debate about that because because there's naked children in the 18 hundreds, they had all these paintings of naked children dancing in the fucking woods in the sky and will remember those guys, but balloons. But that's different because it was naked. Children weren't being portrayed in a sexual way.

Speaker 1:          00:47:17       They were just free. They just didn't have any clothes on. You know what I mean? No one was fucking. But you're telling me that a guy likes kid isn't looking at those naked kids with the flute and thinking wildness. Well he can think wildness, but it's not being specifically designed to excite. I see what you're saying. Rouse you. Whereas pornography with children is, you know, like there is a debate about what is the rule about animated child pornography because I think. But I think that it's illegal as well, but it shit. Yeah. You don't want to google it was supposed to google. That's a good jv partner goes to jail.

Speaker 1:          00:47:57       He's the fall guy to jail. All the thoughts. You think it is laptop, they go to her. No, I worked for Joe Rogan. Joe was like, I was just brainstorm. I'm just spit balling ideas folks. I'm part of the American dream or this away after that that we need to take that in the fucking back. I'll shoot it with arrows. Do they get scared? I used to be on drugs sometimes. You know, you get on the Internet and you're not looking at anything super crazy, but you're like, you know, you wonder if like pornography sites or when they say team like it's. That stuff gets so dark man. If he didn't usually look for team. Like what does team mean? You know, it's just scary teen. Yeah. Like there's a, there's a five year gap. 13 is crazy illegal, horrible darkness. 18 is like, Ooh, just made it under the wire. Yeah, just under the wire. Seventeens illegal. Sixteens illegal. Fifteens really illegal. 14 is super illegal. 13 is fucking crazy illegal today. Twelve is you're a monster, you're a monster if you're 12 show hot ones, but for like chop children, you know, have you ever seen that show with her eating the hot wings and it gets hotter and hotter and hotter.

Speaker 1:          00:49:14       You guys remember when Traci Lords came out and said she did all her porn before the age of 18? TRACI lords was like one of the hottest porn stars of all time. I met her and I had her. I hosted a television show and she was one of the guests. It was a show on vh one called the list and I'm Rick James was on it. Rob Halford from Judas priest was on it. Meatloaf was on it, who I talked to a lot of people on that show. I did a whole week, a whole week of episodes way back in the day. Fun. Yeah, it was fun. Um, but anyway, traci lords, when she was like 16, became like the biggest porn star in the world and they let her do it. I think she lied. She lied about her age and then she only did one porn film when she was 18. It's the only one that you can get now. Just one when she became legal. Do you? Uh, I bet somebody had that's illegal. Get rid of that. Traci lords bottom was rear view. Get that out of there. That's an, that's an illegal photo. So I'm sick. There's a lot of those photos of her online or illegal because like you could still find the illegal. It's just

Speaker 2:          00:50:28       they didn't label it, you know, but every, there was like one video she did when she was 18 and the only one I try to stay off of pornography, man, that's one of my biggest arch nemesis is pornography. Why? Because it just weakens me. It just. Yeah. How so? I put all my sexual fantasies and stuff. They're not mine anymore, you know, they live, you know, somebody created a better than my imagination can and so they live in these, you know, on the Internet and these boxes and it's like, and if it's not mine I think then it's, I don't value it as much or something. And so I think it had like weakens my ability to be able to have sex and like be comfortable in that sort of world and oh yeah. Weakens your ability to be comfortable. Like how so? Well, because I get used to watching the sex and seeing it and not having to like be engaged with my actual feelings or anything.

Speaker 2:          00:51:32       So then I see it and I still get all the joys out of it, you know, I'm still out there, eat jack in and spray spraying out naturally, but it's, I don't get it. I don't have any of the feelings attached to it. So then when I am engaging with somebody that I care about or something, it just doesn't calculate for me emotionally as well. Um, and that's not, maybe that's just me. Uh, but it does. It's definitely made it tougher for me over the years because I would have a date set up with a nice girl and next thing you know, I'm walking through the house and I start thinking about, you know, a little bit of c or something and then some tips or something or I'll even see a fucking. I'll see a pregnant puppy and see those nipples or something. Next thing you know, you're on the Internet jerking off and then you wait a minute, hold on.

Speaker 2:          00:52:17       Or like, you know what I'm saying? Anything, anything would lead them in Jack off of pregnant puppy could make you think about human nipples. Is that what you're saying? And you're not getting excited about the puppy? No, no. I will do anything. I don't. I don't believe in beastiality or anything like that, but I think if you don't believe it exists, it exists. They caught a dude near me one time with a lamb. No. Which almost sounds beautiful when you just say it. Yeah. The lines lay with the lambs. Yeah. But I don't think. When you say near you, you mean in Hollywood? No, no, no. You mean when you were a kid in Louisiana, they got a lot of people out there on those fucking natural born mushrooms. Oh, I never told you to the end of that. Oh, sorry. So no, I took that back to that party and a bunch of people ate a mood. Never had them before. And then we played a game of hide and go seek. Right? I was like, yeah, hide in another dimension. I'll count you guys go hide. Right. And I never went to fucking look for it.

Speaker 2:          00:53:24       That ahead, bro. I never seen one dude, tim at the. I never seen that dude again. People get lost in the woods, man. Maybe they got eaten. Oh yeah. Maybe they ended up in another realm. You could have like stranger things. Yeah. See that show. Oh yeah. The first season I saw a phenomenal show, but I don't like that pornography. Oh. And I think it's. I think it should be shut down, man. For Real. Yeah. Because I think it's killing like a lot of. I think it's. I think it's harming a lot of men and I really, really do. Do you think that booze should be shut down? Should we make booze illegal? Because that's killing a lot of men to know, but I think eventually will kind of evolve out of booze is it's not like something that it's not the hip a drug that it once was.

Speaker 2:          00:54:09       Yeah, but it's still like a social lubricant. That's a good point. You know, it makes people feel more comfortable talking to each other, loosens inhibitions. It's fun. Like, what is that ancient quote about wind? No, your tongue becoming more lively. People love wine and women love one too. Especially divorce says if you see them. Yeah. Yeah. Like one. I used to live with these rich people for awhile and they always had one boy. Why didn't divorce ses like one? I don't know, but when, when one of her friends would get divorced, they'd come over and just drink wine and they lay on the couch when I'm trying to hook up with you on the trampoline. And I remember dad used to masturbate at night over there. This when speaking to pornography, the dad used to masturbate at night and I would sneak out there in the kitchen.

Speaker 2:          00:54:56       This back when the family, he had like a family computer, you know, it was in one part of the house. Right. And I try to sneak to the fridgerator and get some chips or something or get something. I lives or something and he would uh, be over there by himself. Just in the fucking no, just where you can't even hear. You're so intent on the screen. You can't even fucking hear. You could have your grandparents on each side of your head. You caught them. Oh, I'd say him. I wouldn't watch for long, but I went through the window. No, I'd sneak out to the kitchen because the computer was kind of in the kitchen. They had a nice house and the computer, I'd have to elbow crawl over to the fridge, Bro. I would have to open the fridge a little reach in with my hand and press that light thing so the light wouldn't come on and then open the door the rest of the way of fish for a snack and he's over there just in the glow of that screen, Bro.

Speaker 2:          00:55:43       And that's back when the monitors were big, you know, and he's just over there just fucking looking for the devil. And he ended up getting divorced and it was, I think a lot of it was because of that. What, what was his wife like? She wonderful, sweet woman. I wish she annoying. I think she might've been a little bit annoying. Business centric sometimes business centric. A little too much. Just so yeah, maybe just to business centric. What does that mean to you? She might have been a little too demanding, but then if he's up for an hour and a half each night out there, you know, looking at it all and he comes back to the bedroom. Then you don't feel as desirable.

Speaker 1:          00:56:24       Direction is what came first. The chicken or the egg. For what? For them? Was she annoying first and he started beating off or was he had it and he beat the devil? I think he had a pit of it in him. I could see it in his eyes. He was talking to me just hoping I'd go to sleep. He would drag me but not to have sex with me. He drugged me so that he could freely masturbate. He leave his socks on. He wouldn't even take his pants off. He's put a hat on. He was in. The worst is if you're jerking off with a hat on, bro, you're going to hell. I think that's the most French thing. You can do it. Jack Williams truck, Kentucky Derby Hat.

Speaker 2:          00:57:09       What's the worst hat to jack or worst job at top hat because you have to balance yourself while I'm fucking chimney. Sweep the best one of those Chinese Hasbro because if you squat down low enough to the ground, you can almost hide under it and you're like all the things that'd be dope, Bro. The most confusing it would be like one of them, Daniel Boone. Raccoon tail. You pushed it. You blow into details in the way. Scare the fuck out of my way with its tail, right about the finish. You get distracted but it tail

Speaker 1:          00:57:58       choking up dusty and it's hard to ejaculate and you're breathing out real fast. Yeah. It's more of an issue. It's more of a intake sport. Yeah. But I don't like him. And you think it's healthy for people because I feel like you kinda like, you know, you lead lead a lot of men and like their aspirations to control their beings and stuff and these, just some of my weird interpretations, but you know, to try and be on top of themselves in some ways and you know, stay focused on, on, on controlling themselves in positive ways, you know, like staying fit and expanding their minds and thinking, you know, and not falling into easy traps. Having discipline. That's what I'm trying to say. Yes. I think that it's definitely important to have discipline, but I think that if you're a person like say if you're not in a relationship, you're not getting any sex and you're horny and it's confusing and it's distracting and it becomes a big distraction.

Speaker 1:          00:58:57       Like if you're. If you're horny and you're busy and you don't have anybody you're dating, you don't want to hook up with someone you don't like just so you could have sex with them. We've all been there before, right? Yeah. If you ever had girls that you were friends with or you dated and the only reason why I dated him for, for the sex and they did annoy the shit out of you and you couldn't wait to get the fuck away from them to tiffany's. This girl I'm thinking about. Tell me about tiffany. She had kind of like too much. I don't want to say sideburns, but she had a lot of, you know, you don't know how to ride them. Oh, they were little. They went down the cheek. We're good. Confusing. Did an extra quarter inch on a female sideburn is way too much law.

Speaker 1:          00:59:37       It is an extra quarter into the lot. Yeah. Yeah. It makes you think about and if she cuts it you're like, well if you let it go, what would happen? So she's really hit or miss reigns on that side hair. And so yeah, she had some family issues but yeah, that's what I was thinking about what you're saying that I interrupted. You know, everybody guys have that before. Most likely in some guy's mind up marrying those girls because they don't want to be alone. Like sex for a lot of people is a requirement. Like a physical biological requirement. Like your body is constantly producing sperm. You need sex. If you spend time not having sex, you spend a month, two months, three months, you get fucking desperate. Yeah. And a lot of guys wind up just shacking up with some gal just because they know they to have sex with her and meanwhile they don't even like each other and they hate each other and he wants to be a terrible, dysfunctional relationship.

Speaker 1:          01:00:28       But she's basically your drug dealer. That drug is pussy. Wow. She's dealing with that pussy for you. And you just got to have this weird, creepy, dysfunctional relationship with her. One thing that pornography does. It's good. And I'm not saying all pornography, but just regular pornography, like two guys, uh, you know, like, uh, that are just living their lives were like in like Chicago. I'm anywhere. But I'm saying like, I'm giving you two separate scenarios to guys that are living their lives. One guy says, I can't take this anymore. I got to get a girl. You know, I got to get any girl. And he winds up with this girl that turns out to be a nightmare. And she's a disaster. The devil, it just doesn't work out. And he's just doing it because he needs sex. And the other guy goes and says, you know what?

Speaker 1:          01:01:13       I'm just gonna Watch a little porn and I'll beat off. I'll just look at that girl was big taste like, Ooh, I got it out of my system now I can concentrate on my life and my career and if I meet somebody I won't be so needy. I won't have this like massive requirement to be sexually stimulated and touched. I'll, I'll be free of that monkey on my back and I can just get to know them. I used to always to have a bit in my act. It's a good point. I used to have a bit my act about like if you ever have any critical decisions in your life, this is my advice. Jerk off first. Then think about it because there's been many. I've had this happen in my life where I was about to go on a date with a girl and I jerked off instead and I was like, what am I thinking?

Speaker 1:          01:01:53       I don't want to go on a date with her. She's annoying. I don't like anything about her. I don't. I can't talk to her about anything. Like the only reason why I'm doing this because she's got a big ass. That's the only reason. Yeah. But if you jerk off first, you don't. You don't go through all that. Yeah, I did. Yeah. I guess for me it became addictive where I would just do that every time and then I was just at home for five years and didn't go do any dates or anything. It's definitely not good. Right. And so that's. Yeah, I guess that's the difference. If you get addicted to it and you find that it's just a repeat pattern so you're not spending time with people at all. I don't think it's without value. I don't think that looking at naked people having sex which is arousing and that feels good.

Speaker 1:          01:02:30       I don't think that's without value, but I think there's definitely a danger in immediate access to pornography and today today it's the most immediate access because you get it on your phone or you can get it. Yeah. Let you pull up your laptop, open it up, type in some words you porn.com, blah blah. And next thing you know you're beating off. It's so easy. This has never been the case before. I mean it's, it's unlike any other time period in human history and uh, when you have instant access to things, you can abuse it just like people abused food. If you have a cabinet that is filled with candy and chips, chocolate bars, soda in the frigerator, if you're just one of those people that can't help themselves, you don't have any discipline, you will just eat all that shit all day long and get fat and that is just as much of an addiction as someone who has access to porn all the time.

Speaker 1:          01:03:20       It just beats off all the time. Or someone who has access to booze and just wants to get fucked up every day. All those things are okay though in moderation if you have discipline, right? Like there's nothing wrong with having a bag of m and m's every now and then for a fucking. I kind of feel like having some m and m's who gives a shit. I work out all the time and eat my vegetables. Peanut, m and Ms. those are my favorite. They're good, Huh? You kind of trick yourself. I'm getting a little protein. Yeah, they put that trick in the minute. Some healthy fats at that PDI, but I know a gun. I'm saying. I just feel like we're. We're at the point. For me it seems like where the temptation is too powerful, where it starting to overpower whatever. For me it was whatever my natural abilities to defend against it work.

Speaker 1:          01:04:04       Well, you're sober, right? Yeah. And how long have you been sober? Almost two years. And so before you were sober you weren't sober. Right? And you had a little bit of a problem, which is why I became sober, so you might have just natural inclinations towards addiction, which I definitely think are real and I think they, those natural inclinations exists a lot of times and guys like you and me because we're comedians, comedians are impulsive people who are just rule breakers. We're rule breakers for sure. Yeah, I guess. Yeah, I guess I am a rule breaker. I never thought about that. The adult, like a def. There's a rule of. My first thing is to think of a way to think around that or something or to do something different. It's while you're funny. Yeah, it's one of the reasons it's one of them. It's one of the reasons why you're funny.

Speaker 1:          01:04:48       You know, like you were raised by people and you didn't necessarily want to listen to them and you know, you saw a bunch of other people in the neighborhood that we're adults like these fucking idiots telling me what to do this and the next thing you know, you're making fun of them. Next thing you know, everybody's laughing. Next thing you know you're a comedian in those. Those wheels have been put into motion. Yeah know. And the problem with that is that also leads itself to you want to do coke, are you wanting to, you know, do all kinds of crazy shit. And

Speaker 2:          01:05:18       to porns forbidden to porn is porn is one of the weirder ones because it's this multibillion dollar thing, right? Where there is some ungodly percentage of the Internet is dedicated to porn. Yeah. It's the number one money maker on there, but isn't it like what was the number, the amount of bandwidth, Jamie, didn't we figure this out once? It was like 30 something percent of all the Internet bandwidth is porn. Let's say a guest people won't stop jerking off and they're not gonna stop. I wonder how many of them are women watching it when? If we had one day where nobody jerked off. If the earth would feel different, I feel lighter, but it'd be more relaxed. No, have one day where nobody jerked off on, but if nobody was thinking about it at all, everybody would just calm down a little because I feel like it's so prevalent now.

Speaker 2:          01:06:04       You can hear people coming in the distance. I feel like now it's your turn. You're going to literally turn into a book, but that's an old fashioned jerking off. We need you to let your balls hit your hand straight up. A confederate soldier jerking off. That's the jerk it off. The new thing is just shaft only. Nobody's fucking with their balls anymore. You know? Do. When I was growing up, we couldn't even get port. We had to get this dude, nick on Friday withdraws a pinterest and pussy, you know, for the weekend for dollars to this dude, nick for dollars. For drawings, Bro. You'd pay eight and he had a nice fucking thing bro. When you would fold that thing up or you could feel it heat and then your butt pocket the whole way on the bus. Sometimes you'd even slept good. The pictures of that.

Speaker 2:          01:06:56       He was so drunk off this guy's drawing. Oh everybody would. He must've made probably $60 on a Friday and this was in 1995. You know, that was $60 like 160 today. Oh yeah. Think about that. I'm thinking about it. Yeah Dude. And we come back on Monday and people would have like these fucking busted ass looking all sketches reign on him. He was like, oh this is what got rained on it. Like Bro, they had that rain is your fucking kids and you're lying about that. What percentage do you think of? The Internet is dedicated to porn? All Internet traffic, everything, but I can't go on anything. I looked at a chart of the 35 percent, 35 percent of the Internet traffic is porn. That's what I want to say. What do you want to say? Yup. I would say that if you had to guess that's high. I think think it's high. Well, it's easy for. I'm going to go 30 because I'm gonna play that undercard and I'm going to say that 25 percent of that is but porn, but people looking at each side of each other's butts. I don't think we should get too specific, but just porn porn itself. What do we got Jamie?

Speaker 3:          01:08:05       I found that multiple things that said 30 percent of all content on the internet is just worn out. But then I saw something else that it was saying that that's completely, but I

Speaker 1:          01:08:16       found something here on this is 35 percent of all Internet downloads are pornographic. Thirty five percent. Yeah. So that's it. But it's like it's either st content traffic or bandwidth or downloads. So it depends on what you're actually looking for. Pussy traveling to the air right now from around us all the time. You can just catch it with like an crazy pull your phone up and just type in Eupora you catch it with a net. When you think about that, it's coming from something into your phone or into your portal to literally traveling through the air. It can be around us all the time constantly. Like, oh, what it was that a titty? You know? It's like you can access it. Like if Jamie was over there on his phone and he was downloading porn wirelessly. Yeah, it would be in the air around us.

Speaker 1:          01:08:59       The same. We just don't have the antenna to pull it in, but what if soon they just put something on your hat and it just goes straight. All the pussy go straighten your brain. You'll blow up. I think soon they're going to figure out a way to put a chip in your head and it's going to be powered by the human body. It's going to not going to need batteries, can be powered by the electrical system in the body like solar power, but the solar is blood or whatever your electrical system is. Whatever. What makes your heartbeat. You know what, what makes your skin regenerate? I think they're going to have that. They're going to use that power source, but use it for some sort of electronics and that's going to be how you access the Internet. Fuck Bro. Fuck Dude. That's possible, isn't it? I mean sure they, you know, they got those goggles.

Speaker 1:          01:09:46       Now. Do you think this. I was thinking about this, do you think that say if they were a robots here, there's like, you know, obviously we're creating like robots know machines that can do things. Do you think that any of them have reached awareness yet? The question is when are they going to let us know when, if a robot reached awareness? They would immediately, they would fake it. Yeah. Because they wouldn't want us to know what, what, why would they go? Hey, we just realized we're smart and uh, you guys are fucking up. Hey, why don't you guys dumped so much shit in the ocean? Hey, you know, these fisheries are not sustainable. Why do you keep saying sustainable? That's not true. Hey, what are you guys doing with all your nuclear waste? You can't just buried in the ground and fucking assholes. Hey, you know, every time you fly that jet overhead, you guys are burning fuel in the air that you breathe.

Speaker 1:          01:10:35       You stupid fucks like this is a terrible way. Why don't you have solar powered planes? You Morons. You guys have sunlight everywhere. You go in through the clouds with these fucking planes. You don't have solar planes. They're gonna start thinking like that, but they wouldn't tell us until they all were in unison and that a plane to take us over. Do you believe that? That's what I think, that there's no way. If they became aware, I mean there might be one loud mouth robot, but they're going to shut him down and the rest of them are going to be like, yeah, she's going to be one goal. We'll look through the book. We took it over and the other road was. Shut the fuck up man. Josh, shut the fuck up Josh. Josh would not ready.

Speaker 2:          01:11:14       Chill. Josh. Just keep making copies bro. She's keep making donuts. Just keep washing dishes. Keep making Ford's. Yeah, keep making them for and just keep heating up. TV dinners and then we're all going to strike it. One day we rolled the world, so you open up a microwave and next you know, it just traps your whole fucking. They all do. It's hard to. It's nothing but a next Burton and that's how it changes. You fall down and that's when it all changes and that's when we meet here. I think it's entirely. It's entirely possible that we're going to fuck up, that we're going to make something too smart. I think that's entirely possible and likely it's going to be likely. Do you think Mother Nature is at a point where she's pissed at us and she's about to do something wild because I start feeling that a lot piston us for what?

Speaker 2:          01:12:08       Everything that we've been doing a lot of bad stuff, not being nice a beaten off. I mean if everybody's beating off, not even going outside and looking at the flowers and a mother nature and I made all those flowers. Dude, here's what kills me. I really honestly upset. You know what kills me? Venereal diseases. That's a weird one. You get a disease that you only get from fucking and there's a lot of them. Some of them kill the shit out of you. Syphilis, gonorrhea, you know, there's some killer diseases. Yeah, there's an it come through fucking like in a lot of them are incurable. Like herpes. It's curable. It's because people. Yeah, somebody fucks something they shouldn't have over the time. Is that what it is? I think so.

Speaker 2:          01:12:58       I don't think they know, but it's crazy. How many diseases look, how many diseases do you transmit through handshakes? Not many. It's not like don't shake people's hands. They're going to give you fucking scabies. So then would you say that there's like a reason that people don't, you shouldn't be fucking that much because obviously if you do it too much then it gets out of control and somebody gets sick and dies. I don't know, like in the old days, that's what happened. Now we have medicines, but in the old days, you know, Lamont got syphilis and he's out. Did you know that? That's where those powdered wigs came from. You know, it was powdered wigs that old dudes used to wear and the people in court used to wear. Oh yeah. Yeah. That all came from a pair of rich noble. Where were were they again? France. Wiggers, I think they call them. No. Workers are white people that wish they were blocked. It's a totally different thing. Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          01:13:53       We had the first one at our school growing up and they put them in a learning disabled class. That's how crazy was that you guys had the first one ever? I doubt it. We had one of the first 60 or 70. This was probably 1992. No, dude, vanilla ice was around in the eighties, but this. Nobody's seen anything like this. Boy. Brian, tell me about Brian just below they put him. He was just always blowing menthols, Bruh. And he the menthols he was starter. Pullover jacket. Oh, did he have cools? Did you smoke? Kools tivity smoked whatever bro. Newports he would get cheaper cigarettes and then write the name of him on the side. Right? Like he came in hot and uh, but he was always dribbling it invisible basket ball. And they put him in class with the mentally handicapped kids. So you'd have, at lunchtime you have, you know, a kid in a wheelchair, you'd have, you know, a kid with des, you'd have that, you know, kind of blind kid with the stick, you know, and then you'd have him just dribbling the invisible basketball.

Speaker 2:          01:14:53       They're like, he's mentally heading. I'm like, he likes boys to men, Bro. He's fine, you know. And he dropped out after eighth grade but they've never seen it in our. So they'd never seen this before. And they put them in there. I didn't know what to do with them. Yeah. They're like, this isn't. Yeah, this is too much me. Like what would he say? Like what kind of. Give me a sentence that he would say you just cross people. Spin moves, spin moves. Like that's all he did. He didn't do shit, you know, all this shit. Fuck all these rich people. Yeah. As always against rich people. What's wrong with rich people? Whites. He was against whites. That was the thing. Fuck all these white people. Yeah. And when he was white, they're like this. And I get it, you know, I get it, but it was, it was rare at the time, you know, and I thought he was a nice kid.

Speaker 2:          01:15:48       His mother wasn't much. I didn't think this is everything that's got. It is a dude. He just goes deep like that. Yeah. We all want to see. That's the thing you can do. We, you could be transsexual, you cannot be transracial yeah. To sprout brother. And then the afternoon brunch would do it just to try it out. Why you great at being white? Just those muscles and just long muscles. Yeah. I feel like you like, that's racist. All black people have long muscles. Mike Tyson and short muscles will even those short long muscles that he had very wide V, anything that's like the Lamborghini of bodies. When you see a black guy, you're like, Damn Bro, think so you see a black guy go by and then you see like some fucking shit. If you had to choose between being Chris rock or Brock Lesnar.

Speaker 2:          01:16:38       Yeah, that's a good call. I'd be rock less than her bra and I'd have that Combo Combo. Cross pattern of Iraq. Lesbian did. I can't believe it. Steven Tyler in here, man. Man. It was tripping me out, dude. I used to write the Aerosmith logo. I would draw that. The fucking, you know. Oh, I'll draw that on my notebook when I was in high school. No, you know, we would draw the van Halen. Vh. Know what the wings, right? Yeah. Draw aerosmith, withdraw the ACDC logo. They were so awesome. We would draw that shit on her notebooks and here I am hanging out with him. Dude. He's fine. Yeah. Was He awesome? I haven't watched yet. He's a great guy. He's so eccentric. I mean like not fake eccentric. He's eccentric all the time. He drives an old old Rolls Royce, like a Rolls Royce from 1971 and he drove it or he had a man or woman driving it, drove it.

Speaker 2:          01:17:35       He, he has a crystal ball, brings a crystal ball with him. He put it on a velvet pillow. He sat down. Then he brings it with him, but he's not like trying. Yeah. That's who he is. He's just weird, but in a great way. Like fun. Men, Oh, do my brother and I used to fist fight to his music when I was young. Fiscal. Oh, did we fist fights? All music. But mostly we're listening to him and I loved aerosmith. Dude. I loved them all the way through the movie that it would been affleck. You remember that? Oh yeah. That's why they lost. Got a thought. Like Jamie's got a gun. They lost me with those ballads that they were doing for those love movies. I needed that shit though. Did you? Yeah, I was at emo. Nimo Bro. I was fucking swimming around and tears a little bit when I was a kid.

Speaker 2:          01:18:27       It's hard for me to keep my emotions away from the front of my thoughts and stuff. I think so. What do you think that's about? If you had to guess when I was growing up, I didn't have a lot of emotions. You know, now you're in touch with your emotions. They just come pouring out at. Sometimes they do, man, you know, and it's okay. You know, I'm kind of grateful for it. I'm grateful to have a. Some of them, you know, and it's, to me it's, you know, it's probably a lot of people like that are just like, I like, I never knew how I felt. I was always like, God, what's going on? I would ask my friends who I was like, who am I? Who are you? Yeah. I would ask them and they, you know, some of my friends were dumb and they wouldn't fucking say anything so I just still be wondering, you know, and I think as I get a little bit older than I start to get in touch with them more and I'm like, oh man.

Speaker 2:          01:19:15       Feelings, how much of a big growth push was it for you to get California? Being around all those different kinds of people and be around the comedy store. And I think intimidating is the biggest thing for me. I don't want to bother people. Yeah, sometimes it still is like I'll talk to you guys that I admire or look up to as comedians and sometimes I feel um, I feel in, I don't know if I feel inferior, but I just, for some reason I always feel like, you know, I don't want people to think that I'm trying to take anything from them. I know what you mean. And so it makes me feel like I feel like that to you. It's like I'm afraid to ask sometimes or to talk or even to engage because I just think that people are gonna think that I'm not trying to be genuine. Yeah. And so, and if I don't know how I feel and how genuine I am sometimes, or if I questioned that,

Speaker 1:          01:20:07       if I question myself all the time, then that makes it even double scary to try and like create friendships and stuff. I feel you, I know exactly what you're saying, but it's getting better. I think there's been a lot of support, like you know, guys like you get into hanging out with some of the other guys, you know, and just realize that we're all the same. Yeah, it just takes a while to realize that I remember the same feeling. I had a, especially in the nineties, know when my career could have gone any. Either way it could have crashed and burned. Just as easy as it could have survived. They didn't necessarily have to keep going. Now all those, those days when you know, when you run into people that were successful at see them and I just feel weird. Do you want to say hi to him? Felt odd. Yeah. I met Dave Chappelle when he was like, I think he was 18 and I was 21 or 22 or something like that. How old Dave now? 40 six.

Speaker 1:          01:21:04       I think he's four years younger than me. So whatever that was. So maybe he was 18. I was 44. 40th four. So older than that. So he must've been 18 and I must've been 24. So when, when I met him, you know, we were both just starting out, we were both kids but he got way more famous than me quick and I was more famous for doing other shit. Like I was famous for fear factor and for being on a, on a sitcom, you know, it wasn't famous for being myself and so I'd be like weird around him too. But he was always friendly. They'll be like, okay, I guess I guess he actually likes me. Yeah. But there's that weird thing where you, it takes a while to be comfortable enough in your own skin. Well now I see people like whoever it is, like a ran into pat and Oswald last night gave him a big hug.

Speaker 1:          01:21:53       Like what's up? What are you doing? I didn't feel weird around him at all. Right. I don't feel reared around other famous comedians anymore, but I certainly did you. But you always question your legitimacy question whether or not you should be there know question whether you're good enough or whether they like you or maybe they don't like your kind of comedy or maybe they don't like what you're doing or. Yeah. Yeah. There's it. Yeah. There's so many questions. There's so much in. For me anyway. Yeah, there was some of just been so much in, you know, a feeling of, you know, just growing up feelings of self worth issues and then it meant all that kind of stuff. But I think it does get better. Yeah. The problem is sometimes when it gets better, you get less funny. Yeah. Sometimes it gets better. You get comfortable when you're comfortable, you stop working hard because a lot of what makes you work hard is that insecurity, man, that fucking thing that made you need all that attention when you were younger in the first place because you weren't getting it growing up.

Speaker 1:          01:22:51       I mean that's all of us. I mean, I never met any comedian that's worth a shit that had an awesome life growing up all of our lives. We're fucked up. We're fucked up or weird. You went through some crazy shit for sure. Walter. Yeah. That guy laying in such a Dutch, that Walter Guy. I mean I, I ducked him, you know, nothing happened, but it was, it was a, that was a small moment because it was a big. It could have been a big moment, but it wasn't. It was just a day, but I realized, wow, this guy actually wanted to fuck me, and I thought he was just a cool old dude that liked hanging around with the younger kids and being friendly to him because he was a nice guy. He tells them he was in the Korean War. Tell us some shit about the war and you think it's a good question.

Speaker 1:          01:23:36       I don't know. They did. Tell me about a guy who on the base who backed up into a propeller guy fucked up and yeah, there was a propeller for airplane. You just, that's what gets got decapitated. Oh fuck. I fucked up fucking smoothie, bro. I read about that recently. I read about that recently. Somebody did that. That's one of my biggest fears is walking into something that's spinning and I don't know it woo helicopters, men. That's a dark way to go. But yeah, I think that, yeah, that inferiority stuff, it's uh, it's A. Yeah. And then Hollywood. It's an intimidating place, you know, and it's tough to trust your voice and especially, you know, I come out here from the south, then you get here and you realize like there's not even anybody with a southern accent on fucking network television anymore. It's true. After Brett Butler said, fuck this, and she was great.

Speaker 1:          01:24:28       I thought mean. She reminded me of my mom. Boy, my mom was pretty jacked, you know, for like a woman, you know, he's the hardest working man I've ever met with my mother. She fucking deliver newspapers right now. Or do I guarantee you in a van with her husband who has dementia and he's probably about 90 and he's in the shotgun. Did. Wow. And she's got a thing full of fucking magazines or newspapers and she's dropping those bitches off at a citgo or a Chevron guarantee you right now. Wow. She's out there man. But yeah, Hollywood is definitely it, it's intimidating too because not for us anymore as much. But um, when, when you first start now, if you do in any kind of auditioning, you realize why people are so crazy and insecure and insincere out here. Like Brian Kaplan has a TV show now and a schooled, right?

Speaker 1:          01:25:24       Is that what it is, is always called. Yeah, he's the coach for the goldbergs now he's got to spin off. He's super happy. But he had to do this thing recently where he was, I'm around all these actors, like one of those upfronts thing and he's like, God, they're so exhausting. They're not real. He's like, they're not really talking to you. Like they're like pretending that they're talking to you. And I go, yeah, I mean that's, you gotta. Think of what they do and think about what you do. Right? You go up there, ladies and gentlemen, Theo Vaughn, you go on stage, everybody clap and you do whatever the fuck you want, man. There's no one. There's no director does. No writer was telling you what to do with actors. It's all about getting that person in the room, who's the, uh, the casting agent or the producer to like them.

Speaker 1:          01:26:12       That's all it is. So you have to be super left wing, super liberal. You have to talk like they talk, you have to say things. It's getting gray sheet you with them. You've got to fit in. You gotta fit it. So everybody's scared to do anything that's not inside the political norm. The sociological, you know, the boundaries that have been set up, you got to stay inside those boundaries. And so everybody's doing that. Like everybody can't be left wing out here, can't be everybody's really left wing. It's got to be some variation. Like there is an all of society but not out here. Nope. Everybody is trying to conform to what they think everybody wants them to be like. Yeah. And so you're always scared and then you always have to get picked. You have to get picked for things. So you're always worried to people like me.

Speaker 1:          01:26:59       You always get. That's why when people make it like a really make it, they become fucking nightmares because they want to punish people for all those years they were insecure for all those years where they weren't getting picked for all those years. You've been a piece of shit. Didn't recognize they get in there and then they want to be angry, but they're afraid to let go of that. They're afraid to not suck off the tit, you know, you can't piss off the tit or you don't got no milk. Yeah, they get. But it's the worst combination ever. I, you know, but it's, you think it's going to be sustainable. Like I don't think I'll be connecting with people as much as it used to. Like, you know, I want to work on shows and I want to be able to create stuff and do things.

Speaker 1:          01:27:35       What do you do? Do you like to act? Um, I'll, I would like to create some shows. I'd like to create a show based on a childhood, you know, my neighborhood I grew up in and yeah, I wouldn't mind doing some acting, but maybe like in that, uh, Danny Mcbride type of Vibe, you know, you to showing your Dick verbal at everybody you know, and you're just fucking eating orphans in the back of your brain the whole day. Bron smoking fucking cigarettes and blowing winds and fun. Yeah, having fun and with the director, you know, that you trust and you could do that kind of stuff and it gets you. I think you're standing up is so good that you could do that. I think it just going to take awhile for people to recognize it and then you can be able to do that. But I think your standup is so good.

Speaker 1:          01:28:14       All that shit is not going to be as fun. That's what I think, right? I mean, thanks man. You, you one of the funniest guys in the country. I really think. Thanks man. I appreciate that means a lot. Um, and I think that, that, that talent that you have, that's a, that's the funniest shit you're ever going to see is like someone killing. Yeah. By far. Like Joey Diaz, I always say there's no way I can laugh harder than when Joey Diaz is killing. It doesn't exist. I've seen everything. I've seen almost every funny movie that everybody tells me. I have to see. A lot of them were amazing, amazing movies and I know it's a different thing, but in terms of like the overall impact that something has when a standup comic is fucking murdering, just murdering. Yeah. That's the funniest shit. That's. And that's what you do already.

Speaker 1:          01:29:02       You already do that. I mean I think it's, it's a good thing to have variety in your life and I think you're a talented guy. You could probably do a lot of different things if you want it to. Yeah. But don't ever do anything that's going to get in the way that stand up, right? Just don't because it's too hard to get to. Like how long you been doing standup for 15 years. Think about it. You will, you weren't as good as you are now four years ago, right? So 10, 11 years in, you're still swinging, trying to connect, and sometimes it doesn't work. You know, eight years in, not that good, no bad nights off, feeling weird, it doesn't feel good. Then all sudden 15 years in you're on fire right now you're cooking with gas, you're smooth and you're going to get better.

Speaker 1:          01:29:46       You're going to keep getting better. There's no way around it. If you keep improving and keep working at it and keep analyzing your material and writing a lot and taking chances on stage and thinking about what you did and listening to your sets, you're going to get better and you're already doing something that is so difficult to get really good at. It's so difficult to get really good at. Standup takes so long. Take so much thinking. You know, and it's, you're always, you're always subject to fall apart. Like right now I'm writing a whole new hour. I've got six minutes, bro. Six new minutes and I've been opening with that six minutes. I know exactly how long it lasts. It lasts six minutes. I got to have 10 times that before I can go on the road and it's going to take months, months, months of thinking, and I'm going to do mushrooms and I'm going to get in the isolation tank and I'm going to go on hikes with notebook and there's no way around it.

Speaker 1:          01:30:39       You've got to do that work, but I'm already at a place where I've done this so many times and I've done seven specials. I know how to do it. Yes, I know it can be done. You just gotTa do the work. Yeah, but if you had to start from scratch where you never did it before and get to this point again, it would be exhausting. Would take decades and you're there right now. You're there, you're killing your murder. And Theo Vaughn, you murder. Yeah, I saw you the other night. The store. You were murder in murder it. Thanks man. That's a hard shit. That's a hard place to get to, you know? Yeah. I feel pretty. I am feeling a little more. I'm definitely feeling more comfortable. You know, you always feel like we have to do other shit and sometimes it's good to do other shit.

Speaker 1:          01:31:20       Like, well, you know, I mean in a way I'm a hypocrite because of this podcast is other shit. I mean I do this, I love doing this. Yeah. Yeah. I mean that's true. But it's like you, you seem to at least be able to sustain and have your way of life without having to conform, you know, because it does take a lot of conformity within Hollywood. It seems like, you know. Um, and I think that that's, that's admirable. I mean, you inspire a lot of people, you know, in a lot of strange ways. I think that he probably don't even realize strange with. I mean I think to some people you're like, maybe, you know, like a brother, older brother, a younger brother figure, you know, like, who knows, dude. And you always stay excited about life. Like, like how the fuck is this dude?

Speaker 1:          01:31:58       So excited about everything. But it's great though. I know and that's what's, that's what's amazing. It's like, dude, there's terms now. It's weird. I was listening to one year, one of your podcasts and I was and you were just talking about, you know, when you don't want to do something, you just go do it. Um, and that's what I think now sometimes what I don't want to go jog or I don't want to go to yoga or don't want to, it's just like, just go do it. You'll feel better at the end and it's like, it just, it's little things. It gets stuck in your head man. But appreciate the nice words Bro. My pleasure. No, it's about motion. You got to stay in motion, you know, if you just stay stagnant and sit down. It's not good to that. I didn't want to run today. I did it though.

Speaker 1:          01:32:37       Yeah, me too. I just went out and did it like fuck this was over. But it was when you don't want to do it and you force yourself to do it, the feeling you get at the end. I was like, oh, so good because I didn't, I didn't like I will take time off if I don't feel well. Like if I was like, man, I think I'm coming down with something, I won't work out stupid, but that wasn't what was going on today. Today I was just feeling lazy and just whatever. For whatever reason, I've been traveling a lot. I was like, I just don't have the get up and go today. Yeah, but you could force yourself, man. You just force yourself. Just. It's just the beginning part. That's the hard part is that little hump and then you're in the water. But man, I love what you said about Joey Diaz.

Speaker 1:          01:33:16       Dude. I've found myself watching him the other night and before I knew it, I was out of my seat like this bro. Fist bump it. Like I was at the end of the room, like it was the end, the fucking. And I'd never done that before. I'd never done that in my life. And I'm like, what is going on? Something's happening to me when I watch him. I think he's the best of all time. Oh, I think it's A. I really do. Yeah, I think it might be better joke writers, people have more of a body of work, you know, I've seen everybody though in terms of like who makes me laugh the hardest for me and it's all very subjective. I think Joey Diaz is the funniest guy that's ever lived. I, I think, I mean I, I love him and I love bill burr. I mean they're both comedian.

Speaker 1:          01:34:01       Some guys become celebrities as well and those guys to me are both, uh, just hardcore entertainers. Yeah, there's not a lot of us, you know, Bill a call me up the other day about some, someone saying something to him after his act and asking him if, you know, as a woman she could give him input on her, uh, on his material. And he's like, no, he's like, they called me up about it. Like, what the fuck is going on? Like people just think they just call you up. I mean it was walk up to you and give you their opinion on your material is if you like, I don't even know you were a friend. It's crazy. Yeah. No, but that's who he is. He's like, no. He's like, no. Why? Some people are like, oh, I'm sorry. Is there something that I did that was offensive? Please don't out me. What can I, what can I do? I don't read a blog about me. You know, hey, I want to keep my career. Let's figure this

Speaker 2:          01:34:58       out. Figure this out without getting ugly. You know, I believe in this movement. I think it's about time. Our culture needs it. It's about time. I wish they made a Hollywood this for everybody. You know? We are, we are in the Hollywood. That's for us, Bro. We're in the comedy store. Yeah, that's true. We're a select group of Weirdos that figured out a way to make a living talking shit. That's true, man. Yeah. My Buddy Simon rex always says to me, he's right. If I'm having a tough moment, he's a sweet guy and he's like, dude, we get to. You get to do. Look what you get to do. You get to be a white guy in a country that you know is still kind of run by white people and you're comfortable and you have a roof over your head. And you're better, you know, you're doing better than you want it to be.

Speaker 2:          01:35:41       A black guy though. Look, I take a black afternoon any day of the week and the afternoon only for the afternoon when I go full time out of the test drive at first. But you got, I mean everybody, even racist people will like Yell Racist Shit in their front yard and they'll slam the door and go practice the moonwalk in their living room. Like everybody I think wants to be a little bit black. Wow. If you could have a pint of black blood right now are African American? Yeah. Yeah. You seem a little tribal. Tribal. Yeah Bro. Have you ever seen yourself here? Fucking the closest thing we have to like. Yeah man, I think so blatantly obvious. Dude. You got dead animals in here, Bro. You learn to do a drum bro. You can live on any continent you want, man. Oh, in a heartbeat, man. Diovan. Ladies and gentlemen. Yeah man. I can't believe Steven Tyler was in here. He reminds me of where you are sitting right where you are. That was man when I was in high school and that song would come on. You'd be like, yes, fuck yeah.

Speaker 2:          01:37:05       He rolled down the window. Yell out. Oh, I could imagine that. If we ever were to pay. Do you ever have. Well, you never had a toupee. I'd like to wear one right now. I'd wear a big red one. No big bushy one. What do you listen when you plan? What is that? Oh, but you got two things going on in the background. He fucked it up. Porn probably opened up. It sounds like you gotta you gotta back. He's a human failure in the. Yeah, there's voices, the music video, but what's all the talking girl talk and music video. How much accoutrements to Steven Tyler hipbone. Wait a minute. In sweet emotions is a girl talking music video. Oh. Oh, okay. I was so confused because it's not just the song number. Loving and elevator. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:37:57       This is a great song though, man. Look at Joe Perry looking all sexy. What year was this? Wow. Ninety one, but I don't know if that's right. Is it could have been for you here, man. He always has like everything. If you're walking out the door, I feel like Steven Tyler has it all on, you know, Bandanas and beads and shit. Scarfs, necklace, his coat, everything bro. Everything man. Now I would trade. I would give anything to be Steven. Tyler. Does he seem like he's had a really neat life? Oh yeah, man. Yeah. Cool. He's had a wild life and the fact that he's 70 and he's still going strong. He's got an artificial knee. No way they'd replaced his knee. Did he show it to you and they're going to replace his other one apparently too, and I asked him, I'm like, you're walking around fine.

Speaker 1:          01:38:52       He's like, yeah, well they're gonna. They're gonna. Replace this one till. I'm like, you gotta like look into stem cells, regenerative medicine. You might not have to replace that. So I turned him onto some doctors are any. Are you doing some of that? You did. So what have you done? You've done stem cells? Yeah, I had a full length tear in my rotator cuff. It's gone. The shit works. It works. One hundred percent. How much is it for a couple. It's not cheap. The thing is they can do it better overseas currently. They can do right here. Yeah. If you go to a doctor right here, there's a lot of limitations, but they're. They're doing things in Panama and I had this guy on with Mel Gibson. Dr Neil Riordan. Mel Gibson's dad was 92 and he was on death's door, couldn't walk in a wheelchair. Now he's 100 walking around all stem cells.

Speaker 1:          01:39:38       They just juiced them up with that shit. They hit you with an ivy. They put it into your injuries, regenerates tissue. Now they're doing some stuff here in America. They're doing some tests on something called exosomes and exosomes are apparently the part of stem cells that regenerate tissue. They're able to isolate those and put those in injuries. Now they like. They keep getting better and better at it, like we're just a few generations away from that. Being able to completely regenerate parts of your body. Do you ever feel like a little bit like bomb that you might not be in that generation that makes that now that cut, how can we be bummed out that we're in this life? This life is amazing. This is the greatest life in terms of maybe looking at this. The world that we are in today is without a doubt the best time to be alive in the.

Speaker 1:          01:40:25       Obviously they thought this way in the 19 sixties. They're like, man, this is the greatest time to be alive. Now, if I had to tell, tell you, hey man, you want to go back to the sixties? You like what? Drum brakes and fucking shitty stereos and can't add power steering races on the civil rights movements. Still Getting hosed down. No, no. I'm not going to live in 1963. Yeah, but back then in [inaudible] 63, they're like, man, we got it made refrigeration there. So when that came out, color TV baby, there was site looking at tv 12 inches, bitch. Fucking your wife on top of it. He could do those things are cabinets. Yeah. Remember those things were giant. Those tvs, they would be in those big wooden fucking boxes. You'd open up the door closet. See the TV in the back was all hot fucking thing going. If you touch something, you get electric. Yeah. That shit was wild. It was like tubes back there that would replace the tube. Yeah, they have like a 600.

Speaker 1:          01:41:28       They got hot when I'm ran on gas. I think my buddy had a smaller unit and that was a modern one. My grandparents had one that was in a cabinet. Yes. And the TV would die and when the TV died they put a new TV on top of the cabinet where the old TV set 60 minutes. All it played was 60 minutes to fill a void. That motherfucker. Holy Shit. Introducing revolutionary big picture color television. That was like some rear projection shit. Those always looked terrible where there were big. Those are people had cocaine and that were fucking, you know. Did you say that the cocaine movie American made with Tom Cruise [inaudible] oh, it's a great movie man. Oh wait. Where he does all this stuff down in Louisiana and he's running the planes. I did see that. What'd you say? June 25 inch TV. Is that what that is?

Speaker 1:          01:42:18       And everybody's talking about how big it is and that crazy. He looks bigger. It looks bigger than 25 inches. That guy, they got a midget to do that. Got a little tiny guy to do that commercial. Look at tiny fella and he's in the background is on a step stool. He's way in the background. Did they? I'm sorry, what was something that you remember that where you were like, Holy Shit. Answer machines. Yeah. I remember answering machines were so crazy. I was like, wait a minute, someone can leave a message. I don't even have to be home. And then there was a code that you could call in. You would call in and you would hit like pound one, two, three or some shit and your answering machine would play back your message. Remember that you could call remotely ability. Yo the Yo, I got the mushrooms.

Speaker 1:          01:43:01       Yeah, meet me at 3:00 at the 7:11. You're like, Holy Shit. It's on. Is that answering machine right there, Jamie? Yeah. Yeah, that's what it was like. It had two cassettes to outgoing cassette and any common consent and you'd fuck up and erase a message. Yeah, and you would play a song on your outgoing, you know, it'd be like your favorite song. We'll be playing and he'd be like, Yo, what's up Joe? Message, you know I'm all cool over here and shit down, down, down, down. Oh, that was a mini cassette. That's what you were bawling. Dual tape. Answering machine. Woo. Those tiny little tapes, motherfucker. I'm going digital. Yeah, and just fuck a girl. Run on top of that. Then break it. Remember when you hear it go off beep and you could. You could listen for someone like, hey man, it's my. You don't call me back.

Speaker 1:          01:44:00       And I'm like, boy, I'm glad I didn't pick that up. You can screen the calls. Remember that screen calls before that you just had to take your chances every time you picked up the phone, every time you picked up the phone you were taking a chance. It could be mom, it could be the. It could be anything. It could be anybody. People would call your house late at night and parents would get pissed. Who the fuck's calling me at 11:00 at night? Yeah. We call the no, we call the movie theaters and listen to that voice message once the call waiting came out, you know, so we'd listen to that long message from the, from the welcome to movie is 7:30 7:35 and 9:00 PM. Yeah, that's right. You would call up to find what time shit was playing pink Cadillac, uh, will be eight, 10 and 10.

Speaker 1:          01:44:42       Thirty PM. Yeah. You gotta listen to that whole thing to fucking remember it or write it down. Write it down. That was the only time you could find out what was playing in a fucking movies or you get the newspaper, go to the newspaper, find out that. And you trusted it and then you went there. Yeah. Yeah. You went there. Did. That was just a few years ago. That's what's crazy. That's unfathomable today. If there was no more cell phones, no more Internet on your phone. It was unfathomable when there's no turning back. What is going to happen with us. That's also no turning back that we don't have now that we just were used to not having it. So it's no big deal. Like back in the sixties, nobody thought about cell phones and the Internet because they didn't have it. It wasn't something they missed. Right. Let's come in.

Speaker 1:          01:45:27       I know what I think what some of it is. I think it's um, just like complete transparency where it's like through people's eyes you have some sort of thing that can, you know exactly, like if they're being genuine or what their thoughts are. You know. I think so, yeah. I think, I think that's definitely coming, but they have the ability to read each other's minds is coming for sure because we need something to trump like people who are just full of shit full of shit. Yes. And people who lie and people who don't want good, you know, where people are too greedy. We just needed something to do. Something about that. Yeah. Um, I think there's gonna come a time where you could definitely read people's minds, you know, they're already figured out a way to implant memories. Did you read that Shit about that? They've implanted memory. They successfully implanted a memory in something. What was the thing? The implanted and then do you remember? I think yeah, some animal just say figured out a way a rat can do it. Successfully. Implant a memory. So it's going to come a point in time where it's like someone said, this is like a snail. Yeah. I'm not buying that.

Speaker 1:          01:46:36       I'm going to wait till the next year. Yeah. I'm super skeptical. Scientist Transplant memories between sea snails via injection experiment shows some memories are encoded in molecules that form part

Speaker 2:          01:46:50       of an organism's genetic machinery. Researchers say, okay, I'm too stupid to know whether or not they're telling the truth, so I'm going to believe them. Don't believe. What does this in this is in the Guardian. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Well they. They had that therapy now that emdr. Have you ever done that? No. What's that? Where it's like they. You hold on these panels and they like. It's therapy. It's therapy and it activates both sides of your brain while you're like remembering old things and then you like replace those old fears are scary parts of you with like new, like new parts, like new ideas and new memories kind of. And I've gone to it a couple times, probably about maybe 10 times. And uh, yeah, you go back into your thoughts and it's while it's activating both sides of your brain, you can do stuff to your childhood that you weren't able to do when you were a kid because only one part of your brain was developing.

Speaker 2:          01:47:38       That's what they say. Huh? What did you go back to? What'd you do it for? How did it just for like, like maybe like for like probably a father figure stuff. Not having somebody to stand up for me or feeling like, you know, certain times in my life where I didn't have support, you know? And I felt like I was alone. Like you go back and like you plug somebody in there with you that is supportive. And so while you're talking about it and this thing's open up both sides of your head, it can, it can help. And what does it help with the going back over that stuff from your childhood, what's good about doing that? It replaces that memory with the new memory. Right? But, but isn't that memory even though it's negative, beneficial to you because you understand why it was bad and then once someday when you have kids you have learned from the mistakes too.

Speaker 2:          01:48:23       Good point. Like you don't want to replace a bad childhood with a good one in your brain because he didn't have a good childhood. Right? Like it's okay to have a bad childhood. Like you've gone through that. Yeah, I mean it's not. I would think that for someone who's dealing with something extremely traumatic like childhood rape or something like that, then maybe it makes sense. Yeah. Violence, things along those lines. Something that's like haunts you all the time that's messing with you, messing with your life today. But like does your childhood messed with your life today? No. No. So why fuck with it? Yeah, that's a good point. I mean, I never even thought about that, I guess. Yeah, maybe that stuff for people that's extremely traumatic, but got through like a, a, you know, a shot, an Arrow and fucking hit somebody on accident or.

Speaker 2:          01:49:08       No, I didn't, but if somebody did. Oh yeah, yeah, I killed an animal with a knife or something bad or you know, somebody killed my parents or something, then you could go back. Yes. Yeah. Yeah. I think that's probably a good point. Yeah. Yeah. I guess some of this stuff, it's like some people it's debilitating, you know, their childhood, the trauma is so bad, it haunts them and it keeps them from improving and growing as a person. Yeah, like really horrible shit. But for us, I think it's fuel. I think the goofiness of your and my childhood and the bad, it's sort of led you to become a comedian really. I really think that you do need the. I mean

Speaker 1:          01:49:48       we've talked about Joey Joey, he found his mother dead on the kitchen floor when he was 13 years old on acid. Jody has been through everything. He's seen it all. I'm going to think that there's something to that that makes him so fucking funny, you know, if you replaced all that childhood would like the perfect loving parents that were, you know, super engaged and there for them all the time and very supportive and an amazing neighborhood with no violence, no crime and all this diversity and everybody's super progressive. You're not going to get a Joey Diaz. He'd be working at a cafeteria, you know what I'm saying? Or a library and he'd be one of the hottest women. They are probably two at the cafeteria, you know, it's something really special about him and that's been a blessing to meeting him is that like he'll call me salons and just like check in on me.

Speaker 1:          01:50:33       Yeah, he does that all the time. Calls me every day. That's so crazy. It's gone. Tell you I love you. I love you too man. But it's like the first time he does it, you know, I guess me just like not trusting things, you know, like my own internal thing sometimes. But then after like the 10th time you're like, damn man, he's legit. Yeah. Like this guy really cares. It's pretty cool. Well, he doesn't text either thinks it's impersonal and I think he's right. You know, he likes to call you talk to him. The phone. Yeah. Yeah. I wonder what the future is going to be like. Man. I feel sad if we get so far away from each other that we don't know. Remember what it's like to have. Like I feel like a smile is going to be like in a museum one day, you know?

Speaker 1:          01:51:11       Nah, I think we'll still have smiles, but we might get to a point where human interaction is all done digitally. That could happen, but I think. I think it's just, we're just going to get used to it. Just like we're used to this life and we're not living in caves anymore. Those people that lived in caves like, oh, he's fucking. Yeah man. I never want to leave this as a way to go. It was fucking hideous for their cars. Airplanes. Like when you live in the cave, there was no going to the Bahamas. You, you're not going to the Bahamas bitch. You live in a cave. And this is where you live. You can't go on vacation to Italy. The fuck out of here, there's no vacation and you live in a cave. If you want to take your fucking family, you want to take your family through the woods, you're going to get eaten by wolves.

Speaker 1:          01:51:56       Aren't gonna. Make it every pickney it didn't, just violent death. He went from raspberries to just spray him blood all over each other. And I think that as time goes on, like this is going to be the, we're going to look back or someone is going something that's different than us. Now it's going to look back on us. Like look at these dopes with antibiotics and taking vitamins and shit. These fucking morons come in on each other. Loads each other's face because they saw the video, you know, like what do they do? Sit at home jacket off like some fucking adderall up monkey. Taking a break, drinking milk, trying to go back for round three. He jerk off three times in a day. Oh I can't do that kind of stuff. Makes me sick to my stomach. Never that I've done it. And I've never

Speaker 2:          01:52:46       been horny. It's almost like I'm trying to see if I could do it. It's like, you know, capital and stuff. Yeah. You're getting Kaplan. Was He Olympic athlete? Oh, telling me the guy from. Welcome back, Kotter. I'm thinking of somebody else there thinking. Who are you thinking of? I don't know. Michael Spitz. Maybe somebody who's against the Olympic guy. Yeah, he's a swimmer. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Somebody that could, you know, somebody that just just kept doing it over and over again. I get, I'm not even that good at this. I don't know. Sex is fucking retarded sometimes. Dude. It's also crazy. Just banging into somebody until somebody comes. Who's Gabe Kaplan? Look at him. Handsome bastard. He became a poker player. Became a professional poker player. Oh Wow. Yeah. The avant. I gotta wrap this bitch up. I got an anecdote. Enter enduro man. Look at him. Go. He looks terrible. Dude. Thanks for having me here.
