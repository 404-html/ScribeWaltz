Speaker 1:          00:00:01       You know, we're early. I got a tweet this Brian, because we're early. So while we're on the air, I'm going to tweet because at the beginning of this shit, no one's audit. Anyway. Who's the first sponsor? Uh, why don't you talk about, uh, your, your, your website. Why don't you plug desk squad. Dot TV, Brian.

Speaker 2:          00:00:19       Okay, I'm doing this. Hey Desk. Got that TV. We do a bunch of podcasts. We did one with Kevin Pereira. We deal with Dan Tiara, mine. We do it with a bunch of people and they have different podcasts. Comic book, podcast, video game podcast, and you can find them all@deathsquad.tv. We're also going to be at the Avn, uh, next week with Sam Tripoli's Naddie show. And that's Thursday night. And you to get it in on that. You just get one of the AVN passes at that vinyl. It's a new nightclub. It's going to be fun. We're gonna have a lot of people there and we have live shows all the time. We have them almost every Friday here at the ice house. Uh, we have, um, we have a new one that's coming up at an Improv later this month on Melrose. And so good death squad. Dot. T,

Speaker 1:          00:00:55       lots of fun shows. Really funny comics always. Um, if you, if you see him on a desk squad show for sure they're funny. And uh, the, the t shirts that you see everybody wearing those desk squad, cat tee shirts, those are also available on desk squad diff. got.tv. I say that, that goes Christ enough. Um, and uh, so go there and support and uh, also were brought to you by [inaudible] dot com that's o n n I t don't go to oh and it because it's a totally different company and a, I dunno, it's like they like cell banks or some shit like that. But uh, what we sell, we sell manly shit son. Okay. Kettlebells, battle ropes, extreme kettlebell Carrio DVDs, hemp protein vitamins and supplements, all essentially stuff that I use if we find out there's anything really cool out there, we tried to sell it.

Speaker 1:          00:01:40       Um, that's, that's a, I think a good philosophy to have. One of the newest additions is the BLENDTEC blender. So when you might've seen online blending I iPhones, you could literally can blend an iPhone with this thing. It's, it's amazing. Uh, but it's fantastic for a, for shakes, for protein shakes or Kale shakes or for bulletproof coffee. Neil degrasse Tyson does not know about the bulletproof coffee. We'll have to educate him. It was very important stuff. But, uh, all that stuff is available. Uh, like, uh, the, uh, the, the upgraded coffee, Dave Asprey's stuff we found out about it, so we started carrying it. It's awesome. Killer bee honey. Why killer bee honey? Because it sounds cool to have is the only reason to have, I'm sure it's no better than regular honey. In fact, it's probably worse than regular honey, but it sounds gangster as fuck to have killer bee honey in your house.

Speaker 1:          00:02:27       So that's why I have it. And that's why we sell it. And it's a, a company that is a, is as ethical as is possible and still run a business. There's an all the supplements, there is a 100% money back guarantee of the first 30 pills for 90 days. After you buy it for 90 days, you can try it, try whether it's Alpha brain or whether it's shroom tech. You can read the science behind all of this, all of it and on it and if you have any questions about it, there's, there's, there's always someone who can answer questions about that on, on, on forums, but the most important thing is if you don't feel like it works, you get your back. You don't even have to return the product. No one's trying to rip you off. Use a cone named Brogan and you'll save 10% off any and all supplements. All Right, that's o. N N. I T. Brian. Cue The music experience.

Speaker 1:          00:03:18       Without that it would not be official. Neil Tyson, thank you very much for coming on here, man. This is an honor. This is a blast. I think the universe is going to explode. You are for sure the most requested podcast guest ever in the history of this podcast. So Brian and I had been doing this for three years and we have come full cycle with your appearance here today. I have, I felt the magnetic force of your fan base pulling me in. You share, that wasn't what the Mayans were talking about. Should that wasn't the universe aligning. I was so happy when I saw you do this. Uh, I forget what the interview was, but someone was talking about the alignment of the stars and the galaxies the first time and you're like, no, it happens all the time. It happens every year. I told my friend Eddie Bravo, who's a beautiful human being, but he loves himself a conspiracy theory.

Speaker 1:          00:04:06       He loves that. When I told him, I go, dude, Neil Tyson says it's bullshit. He goes like this. Oh, okay. Well, yeah, probably bullshit. I don't want the authority of my academic pedigree to be what makes it bullshit, right? I mean it's, it's, I want you to, I want to give people, I want to arm people intellectually so that they can then deduce that there's nothing to it. So when someone says planets are going to align and earth, there's going to die, I want to encourage them to ask, how often do planets align? And then you get the answer every year. So you don't even have to do the calculation. It's that shallow. I'm sort of a interest in a subject where it only allows you to regurgitate the really juicy shit you heard about the planetary alignment is, which is so dangerous because when people, when people are bullshitting, which is most of the conversations we get into, we don't get into serious academic discussions with people who've actually done the homework.

Speaker 1:          00:04:59       He just bullshit with a dude at work and he's like, yeah, I heard the fucking planets are gonna Align. And just like, I don't even know what's going to happen. And you're like, Whoa, what? And you go back to your cubicle shitting your pants, calling his eye. The planet's gonna fucking align to something going to happen. That's gonna. I, I tweeted recently that if you're really successful at bullshitting, it means you don't hang around enough people who are smarter than you. That's a very good point. That's a very good point. Um, you know, I think one of the cool things about you and your approach to science is I think it's very refreshing that if someone doesn't know something, you're not condescending about it. You're, you're very enthusiastic about distributing the information, but you're not casting a judgment while you do that. And that is something that I think has freaked a lot of people out about really intelligent people or scientists or someone who talks about anything where they have no experiences.

Speaker 1:          00:05:52       This is a sort of a condescending sort of a caring of that knowledge that you don't have. You make a really important point. And I, you know, there's the anti intellectual movement in society and, and I don't blame them entirely for feeling that way because we all know people, I have many colleagues where you try to hang out with them and they make you feel bad for not knowing what they know. And if that's what, if that's your, if that's how you interact with people, why would anyone want to be that? It's a problem of associating with shitty characters. Like they're like, they're not fun to be around and unfortunately you're associating something that's incredible. Like the, the, the actual measurement of the universe itself. You're associating that with annoying people. You've got to detach the content from the deliverer of the information. I dated a girl and she loved, uh, Duran Duran.

Speaker 1:          00:06:42       Okay. What else? In high school and uh, you know, after the breakup, which always has, and every high school relationship, that was eight 80, very eighties. I remember it was like, Fuck Duran Duran, man taranda rents sucks. I could not enjoy their music because I associate it with this young, late, oh, you know, psychologically scarred. Fuck myself. I couldn't enjoy hungry like the wolf, bad boys, all those classics. I removed them from the menu because this one chick, but that, that, that can happen with music that you actually would enjoy. Well, forget about like mathematics, right? Right. If it, yeah, if it happens with, with that, it can happen with everything up the ladder from there. Right, right, right. You are your very important, I don't know if you know how important, like the cool guy scientist is. I can't tell you how many times. So I have evidence of how important that is.

Speaker 1:          00:07:31       I can't tell you how many emails I've gotten or like tweets or they say, people say that there's a guy who's like seriously geeked and his girlfriend is not interested in him and he says what he does and then shows her videos of me celebrating the universe and she says, Oh, is that what you do? Oh, they resurrect the relationship because she then sees the potential for watch the guy can do. That's fascinating. Wow. Yeah. It's like by any means necessary, whatever it takes, whatever it takes every takes to stimulate. So I'm happy to glue people back together if that's, if that's what it, what matters here. Well, you were the very most important person when it came to the 2012 movement, because I was talking to Sony knuckleheads. I had a guy on the, remember Pinchbeck I was on the show, it's something's definitely going to happen.

Speaker 1:          00:08:20       It's like he's quoting all these reasons why things are gonna happen. I'm like, people love them. Some end of the world. I mean that's, I was at a party and the person learned that I was an astrophysicist and walked up to me and I hear you're an astro fan. I said, yes is, and tell me if this is like a year ago, right? Uh, here in the rule is going to end in 2012 and then I explained why it's not. He walked away dejected and I said to myself, what, what is like there's some people are only happy when they're sad. There's a thing where people are trying to uncover mysteries and it becomes more important, the actual mysteries of the universe itself. And you can do simple statistics on this. So for example, the world has been here for like billions of years and you think it's going to end in your lifetime.

Speaker 1:          00:09:05       That's awfully humoristic of Youtube. Yeah, that's pretty bold. And even if it does, your world's going to end eventually anyway. I mean, you're really, it's so silly to delink fixate on. So what I think the most effective, uh, encouragement I gave people during the, the, the Mayan non catastrophe was I said, all right, between now and December 20th just convinced the, your Mayan catastrophe people to sign over all their assets into your name. That's what's really crazy. Very simple. If they don't do it, they don't really believe what they're saying. They don't believe you get fabulously wealthy. They're not going to give you that cash. Yeah, no one, well, I'm sure some people did go nutty and like set up shelters and the desert and go underground and all that. There's a lot of people that went nutty. Well, every, I, I've, I did a little research on this about every 10 years.

Speaker 1:          00:09:56       Somebody comes up with an end of the world scenario and you keep in mind that end of the world scenarios, no one says the world's going to end in 150 years. Right, right. It doesn't work because you can't get gain adherence to your cult that you're building. It's got to be kind of immediate but far enough in the future so that you can prepare but near enough so that you're not going to forget about it at any time. And it's really good if you can base it on some old shit and very few people can read and everybody thinks that the old folks really understood the universe when in fact they did not. Well, they understood the little bit of it. But to say that they knew more about the fate of the cosmos than modern day astrophysics, you must've flunked your math class, your physics classes or something to think that way.

Speaker 1:          00:10:36       I don't understand what goes, what's going on in those mines. It's the same sort of thinking that the same thinking that wants to uncover mysteries and conspiracies. There's uh, there's, it's a weird excitement too, like hidden things. Now you are a moon guy for awhile. Listen, my, my issues with not believing that people went on the moon. A lot of it had to do with a friend who had an uncle who worked at Rocketdyne and uh, this guy was convinced that there was no way to do it. He was an engineer and he said they were so far away from doing it that the fact that they did it and they did it seven times. But I since looking at it, that the weight of all the evidence, I reserve the possibility that some things were horseshit based on a lot of photographic evidence that they did fuck with.

Speaker 1:          00:11:18       Well, here's the Gemini Photo, but here it is here. Here it is. If you look at like the fuel that was loaded up into the Saturn five rocket, you can calculate where that fuel could take that rocket. It's to the moon and back. So it's not going to the Piggly wiggly in the Saturn five. No, I'm a retard it. Listen, if, if anybody has any real sense, they would look at it and say, there's no way that that was a hoax. There's no way, but it would be harder. You'd see people think it was actually hard to get to the moon. Yes. It was hard. It was hard, certainly. But it would have been harder to hoax it. Yes, it today. But the thing about hoaxing things back then, the thing that was so compelling to me was that hoaxing things back then was really sort of way they did it.

Speaker 1:          00:12:04       I mean that's how they got into the Gulf of Tonkin. That the horror stories. Yeah, there was a lot of fakery going on back and you're faking news. The height of the Cold War when there was a lot of reasons why I, I, I thought some fuckery was afoot not and especially all these goddamn documentaries. Okay, so you say you felt justified just because of the landscape in which other things had been happening, Dan and visual stuff like that was the decade where we lost confidence in our government. That was well for good reason. I mean it was proven with Watergate and it was proven over and over. No, about the Gulf of Tonkin incident over and over and over and over. It was damaged. And the idea that they were able to do that in 1969 but haven't been able to repeat it since, of course, makes it even more delicious and it makes him even more conspiratorial attractive.

Speaker 1:          00:12:50       Um, and then the fact that the, uh, the rock that they had given to Holland turned out to be a piece of petrified wood. You know, there's a lot of weirdness to, to the moon landing conspiracy. And there was a lot of, not just the people that were alike that admired it, but it was almost like a religious thing. My friend called it a technological Jesus. He said that if you, if you, if anything is scientific, you should be able to question it and someone would give you an answer. But there's a bit of a motion and attachment and pride with certain historical accomplishments. Like one of them being the moon landing, that forbid people from actually questioned went beyond science. It wasn't, it was a cultural achievement. Every Clinton's quote, what was it? Clinton Clinton wrote a book. Um, my life went in, man, not George.

Speaker 1:          00:13:37       Let's build a guy who was the president, can George Clinton, that's the other guy. That's his opinion is equally valid by the two. Very different Quinton's yeah. Uh, I'll find it here for you. Was it in his book? My Life? Yeah. I was in his book and it was a, it was, it was all on the, um, uh, the, the time where when it happened he was working with a carpenter. So, well, why you looking at it? I, well, the way I reflect on people who say we didn't go to the moon, I say what a compliment it is of our emerging culture, technological culture, that they're members of our society that are so impressed with what we achieved that they can't believe it. Well, yeah, I take it as a compliment that people stand dumbstruck Austrac that it be, it is beyond their cat capacity to believe it.

Speaker 1:          00:14:26       I don't think it's beyond the capacity to believe it. I think if you had shown them, you know, uh, documentaries that didn't have any of the stuff that was in the shit that I saw, whether it was we did the moon, did we go where there's another one, a funny thing happened on the way to the moon, whether his show over and over again, all this fucked up footage and it's very confusing to a non scientifically minded person. You can get on a long downward spiral. And this Quinten Clo, that Clinton quote, this Fox with me, just a month before Apollo 11 astronauts buzz Aldrin and Neil Armstrong had left their colleague Michael Collins, uh, aboard spaceship Columbia and walked on the moon beating by five months. President Kennedy's goal of putting a man on the moon before the end of the decade. The old carpenter asked me if I believed it happened. I said, sure. I saw it on television and he disagreed. He said that he didn't believe it for a minute. That those television fellers can make things look real that weren't back then. I thought he was a crank during my eight years in Washington. I saw some things on TV that made me wonder if he wasn't ahead of his time. Yeah. Look a mess. It's horrible quote to hear from the president of the United States. If you're a confused young man and you think we may be didn't land on the moon, you read something like that and you go, what the fuck does that mean?

Speaker 3:          00:15:45       People in total give the government way more credit. Well, for organized behavior then they actually ever deserve. So I think they believe the government killed Kennedy. And I think a lot of people believe that if they did that they could kind of do a lot of things. Yeah. I mean so, okay. But you know, science is going to move on while you're arguing that and so yeah, that's what we, there's a point where you just say, all right, I got to move on. That's the other thing that makes a conspiracy so juicy is that science didn't move on when it came to man's space landings. That was the end of the engineering of it. Yeah. It was the political will if money at that level. Right. And, and, and what's, what all conspiracy theories have in common is that there's a point where you have to bridge a gap in the absence of actual data and assertion gets laced upon it to satisfy the, the claim that it's a con. It's a conspiracy theory. So you say, well, well, uh, they say, well, this is true. And that's true. And the only way they can both be true is if this is covered up in between. So, so somebody always has to say there's a coverup when it, but when there's actual knowledge about the world, nobody has to talk about covered up information. It's just there and writ large and ready to be absorbed and embraced.

Speaker 1:          00:16:59       I agree with you. The, the reason why the moon theory is so juicy for people is because there's so much of this stuff that you could point to. And so much of it that looks like evidence of Fuckery,

Speaker 3:          00:17:11       you know, whether it's the, we'll take for example, the, the assertion that the photos from the moon lunar surface, since the moon has no atmosphere than a daytime picture. If you're there in the daytime and the moon, you see a full night night sky of stars, even with the sun in the sky as well. You don't see stars in the daytime on earth and not because they're not there, but because the atmosphere is a glow with scattered light from the sun. If you take away the atmosphere, the sun will still be there, but the sky goes dark. That's what the folks get when they go to the edge of the atmosphere and the calling that the edge of space. But when you get to the edge of the atmosphere, the atmosphere is no longer between you and the rest of the, and the stars revealed themselves just as they would at night.

Speaker 3:          00:17:53       So everyone knew this, so you'd see these photos from the moon and there's Neil and buzz and the land air and there are no stars in the sky. It's just dark and they'll say, see, it's fake butter and these are people who never taken photography. All right? If you are exposed for the bright reflective light of the astronauts and the lunar surface, that camera exposure even in the hassle bladder that they carry to the moon and youth is too short to take in the dim light from the stars of the night sky. If you turn the camera to the sky a much longer exposure with sensitive film, you'll get the stars. But then you overexpose the stuff in the foreground. So photography one o one answers that question, but huge websites given unto this. And so what that told me was that people simply wanted to believe that it was a hoax and then made all the information fit that need without actually caring about the scientific truths that with any evidence would disprove all of what they were thinking.

Speaker 3:          00:18:59       So at that point I said people just believe what they want. And so my task was not to debate wound hoaxers as an educator. My task is to get people thinking straight in the first place so you're no longer susceptible to the the kinds of thinking where you become selective about the data that you choose to believe or you get. You get duped by someone who's exploiting the laws of physics for their own financial gain. Excuse me. They're exploiting your ignorance of the financial, of the laws of physics for their own financial gain. So I see science literacy as a kind of vaccine against all of the world around you that would just simply take advantage of your, your goodwill and good nature was certainly with,

Speaker 1:          00:19:44       with things that can be easily explained like you're talking about the light and the, the, the setting of the camera, all that. That's what they lead with that. Then I explained that, oh well then, okay, well then how about, and they start going down a list and you know, I'm done. Time to go to dinner, you know, so that that is a huge problem where, you know, and certainly when I watched my first documentary on the Fox Moon, the Fox one when the moon landing, it was a big with the moon did we go and there was all sorts of compelling evidence that was really weird, like photographs from different spots in the moon, but they had the same backdrop, you know, and you know, and using the, you know, this idea that they had done these inside some gigantic sound studio and when you see something like that on television, you saw like Brian O'leary, who was a, a an astro. And once again it's on TV. Yeah. Of course. Authority built into the medium and then talking to this dude's uncle or a him telling me is what his uncle said. Actually it's just, it was such a, you know, it, it's one of those things where you go, okay, we know they lied about this and we know we lied. They lied about that and they lie about things. I'll get them in line. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:20:49       They'd have to, the government have to lie as well as 10,000 scientists and engineers. I mean, think about, think about this. Just think about this. We knew more of just if there were ever a state secret that the government wanted to keep, it would be the behavior of President Clinton's genitals. Okay. But that got out, that got out and only three people knew this. Three. All right. You're going to hoax a moon landing by telling 10,000 scientists and engineers to keep it secret for 40 years. That's not how humans behave. What was it? Who's who was, was it lemony Snicket who said, oh, I forgot who the author was of this quote. He said, the only, the only way you can keep a secret between two people is if one of them is dead. But that's not true militarily. I mean, we've, we've kept kept big secrets for long periods.

Speaker 3:          00:21:45       You can keep sure, but really delectable secrets don't, don't last you. I can keep a secret that there's a bunker that I'm going to run to. Sure. But to keep a secret that like aliens landed and there are DNA experimenting on it that would get out. That's what people do. Stuff lesser, less lesser stuff than that gets out. Well you like when you hear things about like area 51 and like the Robert Lasar interviews. Have you ever had any of that stuff? True. Requires that you say someone is keeping something a secret. So you know, and I've lost buddies capable of keeping secrets not on that level. Oh No. Oh my gosh. I completely disagree. I think that keep secret. Wait, wait. Yes. I mean the one, the quote with the one has to be dead. That's an exaggeration. But of course, but beyond a certain number of people, the conduct of human beings, if the secret is really juicy and really, really tantalizing, uh, I'd, I, I think the 0% chance that that's likely, I disagree.

Speaker 3:          00:22:45       There'd be diaries and there'd be like people telling their families, you know, like we didn't go to the moon and the no, look at the secrets that get out. Yeah. That they'll listen, listen to, I mean, for sure. Most secrets get out. However, I absolutely think it's completely possible for people to keep secrets. Actually that's a, it's an experiment that you can't conduct, right. To say cause make a fake. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. The statement, most secrets get out for all, you know, that's 100% of the secrets it could go. Yeah, you're right. It's just a simple untestable fact. We'll do it. Don't you have any secrets in your past and you got away with, sure. A lot of people got away with some secrets. Yeah. But I didn't tell it to 10,000 people and say keep it a secret. Well, the idea is that if you're talking about NASA, the ideal about the moon landings where they said it was compartmentalized and you know, the, the, the big one is that Stanley Kubrick was the, um, there's actually a documentary, a fascinating documentary. Again, fucks with my head because as I've always said, it's terrifying when you too stupid to know who's dumb. And that is often where I find myself

Speaker 1:          00:23:46       when I'm watching these things. And there was this documentary that was a all about the different sort of, uh, techniques that Kubrick we used in 2001. And how he changed pioneering. Yeah. He had changed the way you reshot gigantic scenes by, uh, some new process called the, something about front projection. I think that was basically what, what the, the, the name of the process. And then he showed all the evidence of front projection footage in the moon landings. And again, you're fucked because you're sitting here and I don't, you know, I'm looking at this, I'm like, okay, well who's right here? Is this, what is, have you ever seen the video of the astronauts on trampolines? No. No. I never thought in my life that I would be in the position to have a real astrophysicist watch a ridiculous video. And so I want you to pull up astronauts on trampolines. Bring this up. Okay. He got to see it. It's beautiful. I don't think I've seen it. Um, it's astronauts and the, the conspiracy is that they are either on trampolines or they're on some sort of a wire harness because of the way they're moving and that they're moving behind the, uh, the Lunar Rover. And that's to hide either the trampoline or hide the, the movement of their feet, like the way the shot is positioned and it's a motherfucker. I, this one drives me bananas, so shit playing. I'm checking it out and watch this.

Speaker 1:          00:25:15       Doesn't that look bad guy? He just got yanked up in the air. Look, check this out.

Speaker 4:          00:25:20       380 pound guy. That's pretty good. This fell down. Look at this. Come on.

Speaker 1:          00:25:43       I mean obviously if you're a, a person who's not scientifically inclined and you're prone to conspiracy theories, guilty of both, and you see something like that, you go, what the fuck is going on there? Is that really the moon? Or they're really jumping around like they're on trampolines. It looks like it guys getting yanked up by wires on the moon. Well, I'm just saying you look at the trajectory of the Saturn five rocket, so that's nice. That doesn't mean a person was in it. When you watch that. Doesn't that look weird though?

Speaker 3:          00:26:10       Well,

Speaker 1:          00:26:11       okay. You're saying if you don't know what the laws of physics would be on the surface of the moon, one, six gravity. And when you're watching this, doesn't that look weird to you? Okay. So I understand. And

Speaker 3:          00:26:19       the, the house susceptible one can be when you're confronted with, uh, what is given as evidence. Yes. Yes. And, and, and, and if I don't otherwise come across that way, I am sensitive to that, right. To, to, to, uh, I'm, I'm, uh, if you don't otherwise have the tools to analyze information, then then one is susceptible to all manner of forces of thoughts that go on around you. And like I say that, but by then for me, it's, I don't have the energy to fight all of that, but I just, I just teach people to how to think about information and then I walk away and then they, they make a life of the vote for, with it, whoever they want. But they're there. They've got intellectual defenses. And so, uh, so that's how I, the other people who take them on head to head, you know, I like Michael Shermer big skeptics and more power to him.

Speaker 3:          00:27:17       He's got the patience and the, he's got good at analogies and goodwill and he can present to you the evidence that that psychological evidence of why we're susceptible to this. He's got a whole book called why, why we believe weird things. You know, I mean, that's uh, it's, it's, you think it's weird to look at the video and think it's looks odd. It'd be weird if you otherwise knew what it looked at. A 33 story rocket filled with fuel launch from Cape Canaveral took several orbits around Earth, went to the moon, took pictures from the front side of the moon, the backside of the moon, images from the surface of the moon. A week later it comes back. An aircraft carrier goes into the Pacific to pick up a, a capsule out of the ocean. People get out of the capsule, get on the spacecraft. The president meets them.

Speaker 3:          00:28:07       Life magazine writes profiles. That's all emotional, but it all built it. Do you get to a certain plot just saying it builds and then someone shows you a video and says, well maybe all of that didn't, you know, that was all fake. Well, you know, the idea is not even that at all. Didn't happen. A lot of the, the, the idea of proposing the cubic documentary was that the footage was fucked up and then they made a lot of extra footage and then a lot of what you see is faked footage where they were worried that they weren't gonna be able to do it. So they decided to fake it and som to see if they could fake it. That there was two schools of thought. Okay, that's a whole other thing. That's all I'm going to go. But they just, but they, they needed a movie director to help out the, the view.

Speaker 3:          00:28:45       Well, they see, you ever see the, the Michael Collins photos, and these are really annoying, but I'll show them to you where this was a Gemini, Gemini 10 Joan, I tend spacewalk but it wasn't really a space walk. It was a simulation and they just blacked out the background and used it as a NASA uses it is like press clippings. So when conspiracy people get ahold of that, they go, ah, it's probably just they needed a photo. They didn't have one. The fucking guy really did a space walk, uh, you know, and they just decided to just say, just do a little fuckery. Just say, say the guy's walking around space when you closest photo on the shelf and then pre Photoshop. So that's quite a free photo. They painted it. Right. So like you, you see something like that with your knowledge of physics and with your understanding of vacuums in zero gravity, that doesn't launch completely straight.

Speaker 3:          00:29:32       It's completely looks totally normal. Well, yeah, it depends on how, how quickly they return to the ground. I mean, these are, you have to sort of judge that. And, uh, so, uh, but you know, I'd want to see more, I mean, it's, this is a pretty tight shot and other things wanted to look at how far away the horizon is. The course earth is smaller, the moon is smaller than earth. So, uh, I want to save dust was kicked up. And does the dust fall at the slower rate that the astronaut falls? I don't see the dust in this. So I'd say this is not enough information. If I thought it was cold presented today, if somebody, because you can't, you can't put wires on dust. Right, right. And, and, and, and suspend the dust and have it descend as slowly as an astronaut bounce.

Speaker 3:          00:30:14       Right. So you mean like the Lunar Rover for dust? Well, yeah. Or what any, every time they step the dust came up. So, so you'd look at all of these cues and there's so many cues that would happen naturally if it actually happened that you'd have to think up and get perfectly to, to fool an expert who knows what they're looking at if they know it. That's why it had been easier to simply go to the moon than to fake all of that. That's my point. This is the one where it looks like the guy gets yanked up by a, why are we were seeing this? Check this out. Oh, that's on the ground.

Speaker 3:          00:30:52       Yeah. He fell forward. And just back up what people, I think especially, uh, people like myself would have to wrap their heads around, I guess is that this isn't just a vacuum, but it's also a vacuum and one six earth gravity side dealing with a completely alien environment. How much, so how much do you weigh right now? One 91 nineties. You packing it in there. So how rude Neil Tyson, just send them fat. Don't let me show you my six pack on the Budweiser on the side of the table. How rude. Again, this is damaging to my confidence. Uh, so yeah, so you have muscles to accommodate your hundred 90 pound. Fuck yeah, I do. All right, so it's shit. So now, so now let's add a 200 pound pack on. You backpacked, and now you weigh 400 pounds, right? Right. Well, he said three 35 but I'll give you that. Okay? Yeah, just round. She sits around the set. Let's get big round numbers. Okay. So let's say you now weigh 420 pounds. You're slugging your way. You're sluggish here on earth, right? I put you on the moon, your muscles that normally are accustomed to 190 pounds now are now are carrying or maneuvering,

Speaker 5:          00:32:04       r, r, r, r, r, r,

Speaker 3:          00:32:10       uh, lighting, manipulating, one sixth of 420 pounds, which is 70 pounds, right? Imagine how awesome you would be, how awesome you were. [inaudible] 70 pounds. If you have this musculature and you weighed 70 pounds, you'd be superman. You couldn't crack an egg dough. You'd hit people, they'd laugh at you and you know, you would be super, may have to have a really good tech. You have pop up, you would just on your toes, you'd, you'd jump to the ceiling. So it's cool.

Speaker 1:          00:32:40       So what, what I'm, what I'm confusing is what would happen in an earth's environment. That's your life experience. So this is the bias you bring to it. It's an understandable bias and that's what makes the world that the moon and other worldly place. So 70 does down seats that literally you literally could spring up as if you are pulled by a court. Good luck club. You could swing better because the court has to make you feel like you're 70 pounds, but now you are 70 pounds so you just, you just do it. I really enjoyed mythbusters version of it. Um, they, they went into depth about a flag waving and I thought it was really fascinating to watch when the, where they actually created a vacuum and had the flag wave in a vacuum. And it's a, it's weird because it doesn't, you know, we have an idea in our head of what it looks like when a flag waves, well that's obviously the wind moving that flag, but there's wind here, there, there's, there's nothing, there's zero atmosphere.

Speaker 1:          00:33:33       Now when someone would run by a flag in zero atmosphere, does it create any wind? Israel? Nothing. So if a guy hops by a flag and the flag blows in the breeze, what's causing that? Is that a faked footage? It depends. Video, yeah. Yes. If you walk by a flag and no, it's not, has nothing to do with zero g, it has to do with no atmosphere. Right. So you walk by a flag, there is no breeze that, that is left behind you in the work of your steps. And uh, depending on how much air you displace things next to you might, might respond to that. If there's no atmosphere, no, there's no way to get that information to the flag. So no that up, pull it up. Flag blowing in the breeze. I'll, I'll tell you the video. It is what you have here is with, with the American flag that set up there, there's sort of residual stiffness to the flag.

Speaker 1:          00:34:25       There's residual stiffness to the, to the, to the beam that has to hold the flag otherwise. Right. Hang Limp. Yeah. It was a shaft through the top of, exactly. There's a famous quote by Arthur C. Clarke who, uh, and at one point I had tweeted this where he said, it's in space where there is no air flag cannot wave. So maybe space is not a place where flags belong. Whoa. Yeah. Apollo 15 is, this is the, the one, um, it's really fascinating because they stick it into the ground and then the dude hops by it. And when he hops by it, it wiggles in the breeze. Like there you can see clearly that the shaft is just stuck it in the ground. Yeah, exactly. No, no. I'm saying the shaft is in it and it's, it's in place and it's still sort of reacting to the environment. Sure. Now Watch what happens when the guy gets behind it. Now he's sort of moving along and he gets in front of it and when he hops in front of it, the flag follows him. Like it, it goes in the breeze. How long is this video? No, his nothing touches anything and pull it, pull it ahead. Well, if it does move, the evidence would suggest that something touched it. Right, right. So something she is, how close his foot is to the base where the video is. Keep going. Okay. Keep going. Get it to the part where the guy goes around.

Speaker 6:          00:35:49       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:35:52       he's taking some pictures here. Right. So here's the weird, it would have been much better if we queue this up. Clute queued up to like right there. Okay. Okay. Okay. But I can go watch. Okay. Then back it up. You missed it, you back. It's announced. Where wiggling. Just get it to right when the guy hops in front of it.

Speaker 6:          00:36:07       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:36:11       Dude, you suck at Youtube. You really sucky. You told him he just, he missed it. I don't give a fuck. Jesus Christ. The guy goes hopping in front of it. Here it goes.

Speaker 3:          00:36:22       I see a wiggle in the one nine. Miss [inaudible] can you do that stuff on the screen there and an ad popped up? Say that? Yeah. It looks like a breeze. Blew it. Yeah. So possible that that's fake. Yes. So either either, uh, all of this got faked or something touched the flag that was not okay.

Speaker 1:          00:36:45       No, that's not true either. It's not either. It could have easily been that the, some of the footage didn't come out well or they fake some of the footage or that was phase two. That might not have been even real Apollo footage. No, no, no, no, no. What? I mean, that might have been something that someone made and then put it up as a goof and then everyone like me is saying, that's exactly. So here's my point.

Speaker 3:          00:37:04       So here's my point. So there's a lot of fakery out there, official and otherwise, right, right. And, and the most susceptible field of investigation to fakery is euphology ology. Right. Okay, sure. So, so here's my point or ghosts. Okay. You're looking at a picture that's relatively low quality that doesn't see the entire zone around the flag that, that you're, you don't have full information. So someone goes by and the flag wiggles. Either this was faked and there is air and the flag is responding to air or there's something, uh, and, and the whole Apollo 15 mission didn't happen. If you want to take it to an extreme to extreme limit or there's something that didn't make it into this photo. Yes.

Speaker 1:          00:37:53       That's all. It's not, it's not going to have been like as he jumped, maybe a piece of dust kicked up and read it. Precisely. But we don't see it because it's such low rise or is equipment touches it? He looks like he's pretty. Exactly. You don't have far away from it. No. No. You have no depth, depth cue. But look, the things in the ground right there. Let's see the guy go by [inaudible] you do have have depth. If you watched the whole good, it's not good to have then he's got a backpack. Yeah, it's so, so I can't lose sleep over that. Yeah. Yeah. I just, I no I don't, I'm definitely not losing sleep over it. I just wanted you to look at a guy hopping in front of a flag blowing in the breeze. A atmosphere list. Moon. Yeah. I mean these videos are one of the reasons why so. So I,

Speaker 3:          00:38:36       I sympathize with some of that. Uh, but it doesn't necessarily mean that it did no one, I mean, if some piece of footage is fake, it doesn't mean the whole mission was fake. I'm not only that, but I would say that it is so hard to fake every little thing that would need to happen. It's just, it's, it's easier to just go to the moon really. Would it be, why would it be so hard to make video footage and photography photographic footage and then release it? I'll give you another reason why you can't put the sun for all intents and purposes in a photograph, is that infinity, which means all shadows are parallel. All right? So if you, if you photograph them in the correct way so that you don't have a foreshortening of an angle, you will see that that shadows are, are parallel. Okay? They point to one point, they referenced one point at Infinity.

Speaker 3:          00:39:27       You can't fake that. In fact, that's how I know in Hollywood, if they've artificially lit a scene and pretend that it's the sun because they can't actually put their light source at infinity. And so I give, I let it go because it's Hollywood and they got, it's the pretend that it's daytime when they're filming at three o'clock in the morning when there's no traffic. That's a hilarious statement though. I let it go. I pretend, you know, I have to equate in my head, the sun's that affinity, these, these dire, they want to bullshit people trying, but you had to talk about suspension of disbelief with me. I'm like, Eh, maybe she really couldn't kill that dragon with a sword, but fuck it. I'm at the movies with you. It's like, no, I'm, I'm, I look for, you know, they can't control the sun. So one part of the scene in the morning and another part in the afternoon, the shadow is pointing in a different direction and they want you to think of just happened 10 minutes later.

Speaker 3:          00:40:15       They can't control the sun. So they fake the sun in a sound studio and you, and they have the right color, color temperature of the sun, so it feels like sunlight and it has that sort of brightness. Then you get, so I let that go. It's, there's so much you'd have to fake. I'd swear to you. It's easier to just go to the damn moon. That's how I understand exactly what you're saying. But it sounds crazy if you think that people actually couldn't get to the moon, then know that if they actually physically couldn't survive out in the atmosphere of deep space and couldn't survive the, the what? The, the, the, the talk is that the solar radiation, any solar flares, any solar activity would be instant death. And this has sort of been kind of acknowledged by NASA that they rolled the dice with with solar radiation.

Speaker 3:          00:40:59       So the people that are believing that it's impossible to get through the van Allen radiation belts, for you to say to them, what's was that it would be just his fault. It's just you could, yes. However, I don't spend much time getting through them. So radiation doses, not simply is it there, it's how much time. It's tiny exposure to it. The intensity plus time gives you total dose. Right? But these, these people that believe that no humans have ever done it before because the only people that did it with the Apollo astronauts, and there's no one's been able to do it since. And every single space station flight, every space shuttle flight, all of them are within what, 400 miles? Easily. I mean space station.

Speaker 1:          00:41:34       It's two something humble's a little higher, right? But three, six, eight miles the right. But these are the only times where human beings have ever been passed. That was the Apollo program. So for the conspiracy minded, of course that comes up. Well, no, you can't survive in deep space. No one's ever done. It accepts the people in the 60s and no one believes that today. And the reason why you can't get out there is because of solar flares and radiation, all this jazz. So if they're right, then it would be easier to fake it. As you say, they're not right because van Allen says it's safe to go through the belts and then they went through the top, the doughnut hole. But realistically, when, when people look at human beings that have actually been through the last time someone did, it was 1972 there was the last time a human being has been more than 400 miles from the earth's surface. That freaks people out. Every single technological achievement from 1969 is easier, cheaper, and faster to reproduce today. Except, well, no, it had its own trajectory. I mean in 1969 the computer was still half the size of the room. So, and that's one thing, the same computer that it's like not even an iPhone. Right, exactly.

Speaker 3:          00:42:38       Or the computing power that's in a birthday singing birthday card. So what Kubrick got wrong in 2001 in the midst of all the rest that was visionary was the assumption that the future would be one big computer controlling the one big ship. The notion of distributed computing where you would have the power of a mainframe sitting on your hip was unimagined

Speaker 1:          00:43:02       at the time. So, so yeah, things got systematically more powerful, but that's uh, I mean, uh, this was, that's a natural progression of technology that's been going on since the industrial revolution, right? That alone doesn't, shouldn't surprise anybody. No, that doesn't surprise anyone. The argument is that the up the man space flight is the only thing that has an advanced. If you watch these movies for the 1970s, they talked about 2010, my God, who's going to be space stations on the moon and there was space 1999. You remember that show? Of course. Yeah. But the reality is RFC man space ended. I'll tell you why. Money. Uh,

Speaker 3:          00:43:41       yes, that's the, that's the clean, that's the clean, clear answer. But there's a more subtle answer. All right. When we went to the moon, everyone assumed because of the way it was marketed, there was the, the, the, the, the profiles and life magazine of each of the astronauts. And you saw their families and it was, the president said, we should do it. And, and it was this grand mission from NASA, a civilian space agency and, and, uh, the world's fair in New York, 1964 was all about inventing a future. So we were living that romance. All right. What we were not reminding ourselves is that the only reason why we went to the moon is because we were at war with Russia, with the Soviet Union. That is the only reason.

Speaker 1:          00:44:29       Not at all. If you don't carry

Speaker 3:          00:44:31       that motivation with you and you're only thinking that this is simply the next technological thing to do, that when we learned that Russia's not going to the moon, therefore we have no reason to continue and we stop you, then you cry foul and you say, well, wait a minute. How about the future? How about Mars? And how about the rest of that? Well, the rest of that was not ever in the plan unless Mars had planned to, I mean, unless Russia had planned to do it. And so it was not a natural flow of what our technology would have done because it didn't flow out of our economic creativity. It came out of our urge to not die. And so when you have that scenario, of course we didn't go past the moon after 1972, we were no longer competing with Russia to do that. I understand what you're saying.

Speaker 3:          00:45:27       And uh, if I was more conspiratorially binded, I would argue that that's a, a nice, convenient thing to say. But the reality is we still kept up as far as other avenues of military, whether it's a building better bombs or faster playing. And it was all about military superiority. Of course. Wouldn't we be the first to set up a base on the moon? Wouldn't we'd be the first to, it's not necessary unless Russia does. Right. In fact, most of what we did in space was reactive to Russia. We were not the first in space. Russia was, we weren't the first ascent a life form into space. Russia was, Russia spent sent a dog. We weren't the first humans in space. Russia's Russians, we're Russians even put the first black person in space. It was a Cuban, uh, acumen. Cosmonaut the achievements in space or what we did, we got to the moon first and then we say we win.

Speaker 3:          00:46:19       And so we have re painted that error in our memory as we are the pioneers. And we did it because we explore. No, we did it because that's a nice, after the fact window dressing you can put on that achievement. But we did it because we were at war. There's no, once you understand that, it allows you to understand why we stopped. I completely hear what he Sam, but you are fueling to conspiracy fires and the people right now thinking Neil Tyson is working for the man. This is what's going on. He's come on this show. It's tried to explain things and I'm not authorized sickle way. Look at him when it's tricky facts and logic, the muddying information about history. Um, the, I agree with you, but I still see Rome. It still, it means the room for fucker. It means Mars is not in our future unless, unless one of two conditions are satisfied either.

Speaker 3:          00:47:18       China says they want to put military bases on Mars. We're on Mars nine months, 10 months after that, one month to design, build and, and, and, and, and launch a Mars worthy craft and nine months to get there. All right, that's a, China says they want to put military bases on Mars where they are tomorrow. All right. That's one way to get there. Another way we find some economic justification for doing it. We're motivated by, I don't want to die and I don't want to die poor, but aren't there like massive resources just on the moon? I mean, haven't they found a titanium entirely? So that's a frontier and space. Uh, what's the name of this new venture space? Resources, space. Resources Incorporated there. I think that's their name. I think if I've got it wrong, but they just do a Google on it, you'll find it immediately.

Speaker 3:          00:48:06       This is a group of folks, their astronauts and aerospace engineers and scientists and entrepreneurs who say, you know, an asteroid the size of size of a football field has more minor bubble rare elements than have ever been mined in the history of the world. And if you, if you, if you tow that thing to earth, there you go. The size of a football field or less, less size of a barn. So there are platinum group there. Ash. See Nature already did the sorting of the elements for us. All right there, there were, there was something called planetesimals objects that didn't quite grow big enough to become planets and then there was susceptible to being shattered back into asteroids. Uh, [inaudible]. So when you make a planet and it's still molten, the heavy stuff goes to the middle, right? Cause it sinks and the light stuff floats.

Speaker 3:          00:48:56       Well, what's heavy? Iron is heavy. Platinum is heavy, iridium is heavy. Uranium is heavy. All the heavy stuff is heavy. So nature then sorts it, the geologist calls it differentiation. It sorts it. Now you have this cosmic object that later on gets shattered. You now have asteroids made of crust and asteroids made of core material and the core material has got all the elements and all those, all those rare earth metals that we value. An industry that we value in, in jewelry, it is pre collected for us. So if you get one of these platinum group asteroids and, and bring it back to earth, there it is. It's a whole new marketplace. Need like a wonder woman jet with a net, some rolling. She was the net shit and I remember that. Or you corral the asteroid and use it for other operations in space, which is a much more financially, um, a feasible thing to do would involve deep space travel, deep space.

Speaker 3:          00:49:55       Not only that space travel or robotic way, be able to do it. You can do robots. Sure. If you, if we can perfect robot, let the robot look the best way to do it anyway. You don't have to feed them. They don't, you know, they don't want to come home after that. You, yeah. Unless we flee this planet, like unless we have to go all Battlestar Galactica [inaudible] most likely we're not going to need to send people to explore things and we have something like the rover. Well, why take a chance on human biological life? I want humans to go to Mars. I think that's a good thing to do for uh, because you build heroes that way. There's no ticker tape parades for robots.

Speaker 1:          00:50:31       They're going to be heroes. They go that far without jerking off because you're on that thing for like nine months. Yeah, the air and back and they're all being video camera the whole time. We're going to find some real heroes, see some real people that really weep the first time to get into a tent. What you might do just in couples and then you'd get rid of that problem. Then they fight. Can't have that. That's a terrible [inaudible] sex in space and new couples, what does that, what's the, that's even worse. You don't have any history together. What are the odds that they're going to work out? How many new couples stick around for nine months? That's a hard one. That's a hard one. They have found planets and our meat entirely of diamonds. Diamond

Speaker 3:          00:51:07       is pure carbon. If, if the, if anyone didn't remember that a diamond comes in like carbonated compression, right? We have five or six varieties and one of them is what's in your pencils? That graphite and very soft and, and, and that's a diamond smooth. No, no, no, but it's, it's carbon in a, uh, the lattices is layered in Vr in the smooth layers. That's slide off one another. That's why a pencil, as you touch the pencil to the page and drag it you, what you're doing is you're dragging layers of carbon lattice off of the graphite and the thought of it that way. It's actually pretty cool. That's very cool. Yeah. It's almost essential, right? Yeah. Who layers of graph, that's like a sculpture almost laid to the page two d sculpture, obeying your every command allowing you to communicate with other humans. There is a pencil.

Speaker 3:          00:51:55       What's, what's going on inside. What we call the lead pencil lead is, is just the, the term for what the graphite that's in a pencil has nothing to do with the element led. So other forms of carbon, uh, lately we discovered the Bucky Ball. It's carbon 60, 60 carbon atoms that are, that are, that make a sheet that has curved into a sphere, the shell of the sphere. And it's essentially the lattice points of a soccer ball. There's 60 of them if it's, if you do it right and then you get what we call a Bucky ball because it, it's, it's buckyballs named after Buckminster Fuller and he, you know, remember the geodesic dome. You remember those? Okay. So the lattice of this is, um, uh, is, is costs to image that what that what the Bucky, you say that again? Fall? Yeah. So the, the, the, the, uh, the geodesic domes, which, but Buckminster Fuller made popular, I guess in the 1960s, or they predated him by the way.

Speaker 3:          00:52:58       He's credited with inventing it, but he didn't, it was invented by Zeiss, the planetary manufacturers in East Germany. There were some engineers there. They invented this. But this is an aside, but I think it's a pretty cool aside. They invented a new way to project stars on the ceiling, the first optical projector and they put it on their ceiling and say, you know, this would be cooler if the ceiling were round, you know, do we have any round ceilings? No. Okay, well here's a couple of dollars. Go build one or invent one. And they invented the geodesic dome just for the purpose of showing a dome where the stars would be. And this was in 1923 it was pretty cool. That's amazing. So anyhow, so carbon carbon, so you put the carbon atoms at the, at the lattice, at the intersection points of a geodesic dome and you'd basically get a something that resembles the Bucky ball.

Speaker 3:          00:53:47       It's a new form of carbon. That's one of the forums. And one of them is diamond and diamond. The lattice is, is, is very tightly bound. So no part of a diamond will slide off of any other part. And diamond is the hardest natural substance known. And that's why you have diamond drills. You have diamond anvils and a diamond. Because it's transparent and it's also very dense. Light actually slows down inside of a diamond. It is only 40% as fast in a diamond as it is in the vacuum of space. And because of that, it bends so severely in the cuts of the diamond that you can get double and triple reflections inside. So light from one direction comes out in a different direction. Making the diamond look like it's radiant on your finger.

Speaker 7:          00:54:36       Ah,

Speaker 3:          00:54:38       pure carbon. It is the same stuff that's in coal except treated differently. W there was a man who, they, they wrote an article about him in wired magazine a few years back where he had acquired some sort of technology from the Soviet Union where they had figured out how to make diamonds. They're making them now. And I did a, I hosted Nova, uh, Nova Science. Now I don't anymore, but in my, in my tenure as host, uh, we visited, they blindfolded me because they don't want to de Beers to know about it and took me to a secret factory w uh, uh, a manufacturing plant where they're layering carbon onto a lattice. And just the way a diamond is created and there just building diamond, they blindfolded you. Oh yeah. In fact they took away my iPhone because my iPhone has the track that the, you know, the inertial memory of where it has been.

Speaker 3:          00:55:29       So that had to be turned off and I was blindfold and then we do the interview in the, uh, in the factory and we looked inside the, uh, you know, the special patented devices where they make it. Now here's what's the real weird thing about that. Oh, by the way, go ahead. I'll wait. Then I took some of the samples of diamonds that they made and went on to 47th street in New York, which is the diamond capital of the world. And I showed it to the guys there and they were pure than any of the diamond. They had been hauled from Earth. This is how ridiculous checks are. The swelling gets home. My wife says she wouldn't want one of those diamonds. Why? Because cause they're artificial. Well, so I spoke to the morale crazy that I spoke to the merchants and I said, what are you going to do if there's a flood of these diamonds on the market?

Speaker 3:          00:56:13       They said, people are not going to want them the time that he sounds like your wife. Exactly. Because they want to know that it was forged in the fires of the belly of the earth. Yeah. And not just out of somebody's back lab. And I said, okay, but you know, these are pure diamonds than anything earth is creating. Cause we can do a better job making diamonds, dinner Cam. And so for me, I take the artificial diamonds, some poor African kid doesn't have a chip it out of a rock with his good points. Very important. It's just technology replacing human labor. Once again, please. Not a winter. Good way. Does it freak you out when, I mean obviously you're very technologically minded, but when you, you realize that where these conflict minerals come from and the, the actual stuff that's in your iPhone, someone might have dug it out of a hill in a poor community in Africa.

Speaker 3:          00:57:03       I mean it's incredibly ironic. Yeah. But it's the, it's not uniquely poor as a community that's exploited for some economic gain. So, so my issue wouldn't be, oh, I'm concerned about these minerals are concerned about all the places where that's happening. So, so, uh, you know, how many lights, it is ironic that the most technologically advanced shit we have needs to come that way. You know, that that's where in 2012, you know, until they've started reforming these areas, that's where it was coming from. Getting to it. I wouldn't call a diamond technologically advanced. When I think of technology I think is my conflict minerals. I meant conflict and arrested her and lithium ion. Oh yeah. She had a cold and your cell phones. Okay. Right, right, right, right. Yeah. Yeah. So, uh, so diamond, uh, so, so yes, getting back to what started the diamonds, getting back to what started this, uh, carbon is a, is is the forthright, but fourth most co carbon is the fourth most common ingredient in the cosmos.

Speaker 3:          00:58:05       And so in the cosmos is full of places where there's high temperature and high pressure. And a lot of time and we are not, we are delighted, but not entirely surprised that there are places in the universe, even entire planets where a large part of their composition would be pure diamond. How long does it take to create a diamond in the earth inside? I, I, I'm not up on the very, uh, because the pressure matters here as well. And that you can change one and that affects what you'd need for the other. And I, I don't have that map memorized in my head, but it takes a long time. Way longer than your lifetime. So, uh, you, you, once you run out of diamonds in the earth, you're not getting any more diamonds. You're going to have to make them yourself or find them elsewhere in the university.

Speaker 3:          00:58:48       And how long does it take their machines to make them? Uh, you can make one in about a week. Whoa. Oh yeah. You just lay it down. You're done. How big is it? Like a duck? It's hard to make a big one. They make one. Um, yeah. I'm not carrot fluent, but the size of a BB, uh, so one that could easily fit in a, in a, in a, in a post earring. So that's it. They can't get a big fat, crazy charter type Blah and Elizabeth Taylor. No, no, they're not there yet. No, no. They're not the Kardashians. Those are rare. Anyway. Those are extremely rare anyway. And the most common diamonds are small. So yeah, they can certainly compete in that marketplace. It doesn't DeBeers have like the rumor is the conspiracy theory is we should play that. Here's, here's of the theme going throughout the podcast.

Speaker 3:          00:59:30       The, um, uh, the, the theory is that there's a warehouse that they keep, there's so many diamonds that they, they artificially inflate the price by, you know, slowly releasing them to the market place. Is that true? Yeah. I think there's not a pure market in diamonds when, and I think in, in the lingo of economics, if there's a market in something, it means it is traded often enough so that the price at any given moment is the actual price, the actual valuation of that, that object in the world at that time. And it presupposes that there's a full access to supplies and demand and nothing is being withheld. So, uh, yes de Beers is withholding if not to be or someone else is withholding diamonds from the marketplace to assure a circuit certain price. If they flooded the market, the price would drop. God dammit, this is rogue and he listened to this shit.

Speaker 3:          01:00:21       You don't need a real diamond. Well here's the scary parts, but the universe here we are killing each other over resources buried in the ground and in the sands when the including sources of energy, chemical energy in that case, whereas in the universe has an unlimited supply of everything. So why is it an energy? Why isn't that reflected in the budget that we put in this space? Travel? It seems ridiculous and short sighted. And, I mean, it seems like you can take all this military industrial money and say, listen, you fuckers want to get really rich. Let's get crazy. Let's go space cowboy style. And it's go Lazu some rock. This space resources company is doing exactly that. They're marketing face resources. They, they, they're targeting asteroids for EC, economic exploitation. How does that work? Or does it look like his space is eventually going to be like the homesteaders back in the 18 hundreds where you would move there and get a plot of land?

Speaker 3:          01:01:13       Are you gonna be able to claim plots of spanx currently space law, which is an interesting frontier. And, and you know, and at the UN and in other places, space law has certain rules and regulations. One of them I think is unrealistic and it has to do with the waging of war. And I'll get to that in a minute, but the other one is Leeann's space, Huh? No, it forbids a warfare, uh, uh, sort of forbid space from serving as a platform for war. But I think that's completely naive and unrealistic. And I'll tell you why in a minute. But, uh, and, and people saying what space should be peaceful, a peaceful place. I think that is naive. That's naive bordering on stupid. They obviously haven't seen thoust target cause yeah. So, so, so, uh, in in space. So the way the laws, the books now read that could change with emerging consensus. The weight now reads is you cannot own anything off the earth. However, no one can stop you from putting a flag on it and no one can stop you from mining resources from it.

Speaker 1:          01:02:20       You just can't claim to own it and require that someone else pay you to use it. Okay. So in other words, there's no private property and there's no private objects in space, but if you do acquire an object and you bring it pat, can you use it for profit that hasn't been fully explored legally yet? Yeah. If you invested all the money, I think the, the laws are going to go in the favor of free market capitalism. And this is why conspiracy theories will step in and say it's, that's why Obama's moving towards socialism, that trying to control all the resources in space, they want to pull it all those minerals and diamonds, et cetera. When the Jews and their marketplace stranglehold on the diamond industry, except the rate at which Obama's plan to return to space, Disney slow is not commensurate with that as a viable in less see, take into account the conspiracy theory to keep the elites alive forever and start killing off people with eugenics and wars.

Speaker 1:          01:03:21       There's a lot of people that, that's another very fine conspiracy theory, crop circles and chem trails. I don't know if you're familiar with either one of those. I don't know about chem trails, but certainly crop circles. Everybody knows about crop circles. I mean, come on. I know about chem trail. I don't need to introduce you to Eddie Bravo. What chem trails are is one of the easily the silliest conspiracy theories. Um, there's a something, there's validity to it. Unfortunately in there, first of all, cloud seeding has been done in many cultures. It's done on a regular open basis. In the United Arab Emirates and Abu Dhabi, they made it rain 50 times last year. Like they're doing it every week. They can. You can do it. We know that scientifically. But what they're claiming is that the, the government is spraying shit out of planes and these are not regular planes and those contracts that lasts forever.

Speaker 1:          01:04:12       Those are actually chem trails. Those are fake clouds. And there's all sorts of different things they're spraying that control the populace through spraying. What is it me? What is, how, in what way is it controlling it? So what is asked? What is the key? Too many fat. You've already gone too far with this. I had to talk to a pilot. I said, okay, like this is driving me crazy. You know, cause he was like, when we were kids, man, those clouds in the sky, when a pub plane would fly over, they would dissipate really quickly. But now they stay forever. They're fucking spraying us with Shit, man. This is how crazy people are. So then I talked to a pilot and I said, okay, what is, what, why is it, what's, how come? Sometimes the clouds go away and sometimes the persistence of contrail, it says it's amount of how much atmosphere, how much water's in the atmosphere, which varies. Yeah. Yeah. And I go, thank you. That's all I need to know. So when the jet engine flies through, it makes it an artificial cloud. It really does. It spirals up the water and the wind and in it's wake, it leaves this temporary cloud and it has to cool in order for the to condense. And if you look immediately outside of the engine, there's an interval where it is not clouded, it's completely transparent. And then it cools reaching the temperature of the surrounding air

Speaker 3:          01:05:18       and then it condenses out. But the, the levels of moisture at different, at different altitudes. So a plane will not leave the same contrail at all altitudes from near an airport up to 40

Speaker 1:          01:05:28       exactly. Just as like some areas it rains in some areas or desert. There's, there's areas of, and it shouldn't be, it should be it, but people and people get really wacky with that one. That's a weird one. When it's another one where there's very little looking into the possible answers. It's like they want it to be, they want, you want it to be, want it to be. They want it to be cancer causing things that the government sprang on us in order to lower the population numbers because there's too many of us. Right. That's why there's lithium and the water supply and Neil Tyson have you like I had this conversation with someone, I said, did you know there's antidepressants in the water supply? And I go, well that's cause people flush their antidepressants and they might pick they pee and some of it's, I go, but the amount is so tiny.

Speaker 1:          01:06:09       I go, this is nothing that you could ever late. It's not psychoactive amounts to kind of, you know that man. How do you know that? I'm like, I don't know how to, you know, man, go get some water and bring it to a fucking testing facility and you can test this. Stop freaking me out. There's enough real shit to freak me out. What drives me nuts is like end of the world. People. I would, uh, I would have conversations with them and they were convinced this mind thing and all societies all headed towards a certain thing. It's really obvious. And I'm like, do you ever pay attention to super volcanoes? Yeah. The real issues to be contended with here. Some real shit going on in Yellowstone. Yeah. Like yellow stone every six to 800,000 years essentially kills half the continent off.

Speaker 3:          01:06:50       Do you know that? We were, when we were growing up, old faithful was called old faithful and it was faithful to the clock. And then there was some geologic stuff that happened and now it will still blow, but it's not regular.

Speaker 1:          01:07:04       I saw this some graph. I don't know if they'd media. Yeah. Sometimes faithful, you know. Well, he held it together for a long time. Yeah. You got to get some credit. They had, uh, yeah, the, um, there was a national geographic piece on Yellowstone where it was right when they sort of figured out that Yellowstone was a called Damn volcano. They figured out how large it was and they were talking about the, the frequency of earthquakes and it was over like a six month period or something like that. There was 2000 earthquakes in Yellowstone.

Speaker 3:          01:07:35       Trends are what your threshold is for measuring an earthquake. Yeah. Most, most earthquakes in the world, if they happen right under your feet, you wouldn't notice it. And so because there's, their energy level is so low that they don't even get past the absorbers in your knee. You got new knees or new hips. What did you get? Ligaments. Ligaments. Yeah. Almost no matter the condition of your knees, you wouldn't feel an earthquake up to two or three. And in New York City with a subway rumbling under foot with where I live, uh, that's like 4.5 on the Richter scale. Yeah. It's something, in fact, when the World Trade Center collapsed, uh, that triggered, I made, I was four blocks away when it happened. Uh, that triggered, I paid very close attention to everything that was happening, including what kind of vibration in the ground that caused. And it was about like the a train going 30 miles an hour, uh, just below your feet.

Speaker 3:          01:08:28       So when the train goes, you feel it. Oh yeah. Yeah. And you don't, and you ignore it because it's the normal vibrations of life. So that's city living. Yeah, it's the three to three and four. So, and so you look at the earthquake accounting, there are tons of these and so they don't really matter until it can structurally hurt something. And then you talk about it becomes a news item. So, so the count of earthquakes is not interesting. You want the number of earthquakes above seven, above six and a half above five. They start getting interesting. Uh, but not lethal yet, you know? So, uh, yeah. You want it set your threshold then give me the number. So are those earthquakes of small ones like the Elson once, are they going on everywhere? It's just they're measuring it and Yellowstone. Yeah. Well some, there's more.

Speaker 3:          01:09:12       It goes, some places are more GL active, geologically active than others. Places that are geologically active where you get the occasional seven, eight, nine or seven and eight on the Richter scale or whatever the scale is called today. Uh, those places you getting these low ones practically all the time. Yeah. Oh, all the time. Okay. So freaking out about Yellowstone having 2000 earthquakes like really should freak out about 2007. Yeah, that's exactly right. And this is another one of these things where, uh, it's, it's partial information scaled up into a catastrophe scenario that feeds people's fears and that the kind of fear that people delight in, uh, people say, Oh, you don't, Manhattan has a fault line running right down the middle. Manhattan were 3 million people live and work and yeah, it does. And it's been dead for a million years. That's a geologically dead fault. Okay.

Speaker 3:          01:10:06       So it hasn't moved in a million. I don't know the number, but it's, it's dead. I mean, it's nothing happening there. We've, we've got, you know, the place swings on it. There's not, and part of it is what created Harlem Heights, which overlooks Harlem. In fact, when Columbia moved in, they renamed it. It's, it's actually called, um, they call it, uh, Morningside heights, but it's actually Harlem heights and uh, that's a raised part of Manhattan. It's a well above the lower areas where the rest of Harlem is. It's, it's, it's a cool, so at Manhattan's has some remnant geologic features. Not all of it has been a bulldoze over to put skyscrapers. That's fascinating. I didn't know that it was actually above it because of, of Oh, because of a fault. It's a fault line. Fascinating. Fault line is some of that was retained in central park.

Speaker 3:          01:10:49       They left some geologically interesting features there. Uh, but the point is there earthquakes down to level two. What were measurable there. It happens all the time in most places and they ha they happen often in most places and and practically continuously where you are geologically active and for folks don't know what we were talking about earlier when we set a called Darryl volcano. Essentially what it is is a volcano that when it blows, it leaves like almost like a crater. It leaves like a gigantic, I think it's 300 kilometers wide in a super volcano. You basically repave major land areas of earth. Do you know Venus has very few craters on it and given its age and the fact that there is no rain or weather systems that could erode them, you can ask, well what's going on there? And further analysis shows that Venus completely repaved it's surface at regular intervals that if you can pull enough lava, which is just liquid rock right it liquid rock, you pull it out of the liquified layers of the planet and put it on the surface, it'll spill out, spread around and cover up all craters that might've been there before.

Speaker 3:          01:12:04       Do you know what we see? You know the sea of tranquility? What does that tell everybody? Spot in the moon it's, it's, it's a place on the moon. It's called a c because back before we knew anything about the moon, it was a large dark area, flat, dark area of the moon. And we imagined that maybe there's water there and if there's water there, and so we, there's their regions called cs. You know what these actually are there. They're volcanic basins. When the moon was geologically active, lava spilled out but spread all over the surface of the moon as far as it could reach. And these became what we, today we call seeds and you know the CS happened very late because they have fewer craters then adjacent areas where the lava did not spill in. So you could date the surface of the, of the moon based on how many craters there are within a given area.

Speaker 3:          01:12:56       Do you ever feel like, you mean since your fascination is space quite sensitive to finish that? So on Venus where there are very few craters, when we know there should be many, that tells us that the entire surface suffers from fresh and volcanic flow. Unlike the moon with the last time it laid out, the CS is, is billions of years ago. So he's been is just constant Superbowl constantly essentially. Yeah. When you see something like the moon, which is completely covered in uh, in, in meteor impacts, it's one of the things that really sets into my mind or it gives me a reference point for time because we've, we out, we aren't seeing these big impacts on a regular basis. And in fact we've only recorded a few of them. What the recent one in Jupiter, this massive one which was by yeah. Which an amateur astronomer, right? Yeah.

Speaker 3:          01:13:47       Caught it. And the, uh, the, the blonde, there's a flash of light on Jupiter just by accident. Car. Yeah. Yeah. And then there was the other one, the one that was observed and it was a 94. Yeah. The big one. Uh, when was that? Yeah, so that one was commit shoemaker. Levy nine. Yeah. And that one, it was a comment that the tidal forces of Jupiter on a previous pass had broken that solid comment up into two smaller, but still significant chunks of content material. And it had a trajectory that was headed straight for Jupiter and we were ready for it. And the Hubble telescope was in place and everybody was aiming. And each one of these blobs of comment that fell into Jupiter, it plunged into the atmosphere and exploded with more energy than all the atomic, all the bombs in the American arsenal.

Speaker 3:          01:14:36       And so the, the, sorry, a better way to say that is it plunged with more energy than the impact that rendered the dinosaurs that rendered the dinosaurs extinct on earth. And so to get a sense of the energetics of the solar system is extraordinary. And this, so the solar system to get to your point is a shooting gallery and moon the moon, which is sitting right in front of our nose. It's our nearest neighbor that writ large is the evidence of what earth plows through daily. And we are protected by our atmosphere from most of it. And, um, the, my other point was

Speaker 1:          01:15:13       that when you see that and you see all the impacts, that there's so many impacts when you try to wrap your head around how many years, a million years is how many years a billion people have. It's, it's, it's one of the hardest possible. Our brains are

Speaker 3:          01:15:27       wired for understanding whether we'll be eaten by a tiger or lion or right, or whether you know, the space and time our minds interact with it in very terrestrial ways. With the advent of the telescope and our understandings of the laws of physics, we've had to come to an understanding of the depth of time and the expanse of space that completely transcends what it is natural for us to contemplate. And so you have to almost grow accustomed to these facts rather than take them into your heart because they fall so far beyond anything we've been trained to think about. And that's why it's so hard for anyone to believe that you can go from micro organism to a giraffe or a human being over the billions of years in the cycle of life. Do you believe in evolution? I, it's not a matter of belief. It's what the evidence shows. And, and when I'm given the choice, I'm going with the evidence.

Speaker 1:          01:16:29       And that's silly. That's a ridiculous way to live. Um, whatever the depth, the depth of time, just like a piece of rock, like the moon, where you see all those impacts, you think, how long is that? What am I looking at? I mean, how much, how much time did it take for all those rocks to fly at a space and hit that? And as a temporary organism, you being a human being who has this sort of terrestrial fascination, it's gotta be like almost like a mad race to collect information and an imp. Infinitely impossible universe. We are like mayflies in the cosmos. Yeah. And not even that.

Speaker 3:          01:17:10       Think about it. A may fly. Not even that. That's right. I think of what doesn't mayfly know of a change of seasons. Yeah. For change of years. These are unfathomably long timescales to the lifecycle of a mayfly generations. Yeah. And so under moms and so here we are. We're not for the methods and tools of science, we would have no clue about the universe of time and the universe of space that exists beyond the, the physical accessibility of our biological form. So, uh, when you, so, so interesting analogy to this I think is when you look up at a puffy cloud to you, it's just a cloud sitting there and it has a shape, but we've all seen timelapse of clouds. It's particularly rainclouds that's a turbulent place. The, the bubbles of cloud and particularly the Cumulonimbus, they're just gurgling up there boiling up through the center and it keeps regenerating and rain is coming out the bottom.

Speaker 3:          01:18:13       And that doesn't take much of a time lapsed a video to capture, uh, 10 minutes, 15 minutes. But that's not our understanding of clouds. Our understanding is that there are just these things peacefully floating there and that's just human perception versus a 15 minute time lapse video. Imagine human perception versus the billions of years of cosmic evolution than it really is a shooting gallery. We don't stand a chance when when you, you, you see the, you're right on that fella. Yup. What happened when you see the potential, uh, have hazards and catastrophes a space and you think about the temporary lifespan of the human being, does it, does it frustrate you at all, miss it as if it does it seem like, God, I'm going to miss a lot of shit. Well, there's several consequences. One of them is we don't know how to understand those dangers. If I say a killer asteroid is going to come every hundred million years, you'll say, ah, don't worry about it.

Speaker 3:          01:19:15       But when it comes, it'll render you extinct and we don't know when it's going to come between now and a hundred million years from now, do you even have the temerity to say, well, I'd better build a protection plan and on the possibility that it comes in my lifetime or in the lifetime of all my loved generation generations that follow, we, we don't know how to react. We're not wired for some thought. Let me tell you how badly we're not wired for that thought. What happens after a hurricane devastates a coastline where rebuild, we rebuild, oh, it's not going to happen to me. Oh, this is stuff within your lifetime, right? This is the, the 20 year hurricane, the 30 year hurricane, not the, not the 200 year, 500,000 year hurricane. So are, unfortunately, our brains aren't wired for this. So it's a good thing that we have methods and tools that can compensate for this shortcoming.

Speaker 3:          01:20:09       Do we have any sort of scientific plan to handle asteroid impacts to a paper? Oh yeah. We've got a total solution. Worked out in paper. Completely unfunded at the moment. And when you say on paper, is it for like you can do the engineering, you can do the engineering and, and it's, it's, it'll work. What do they, physics and engineering, what do they do? They knock it out of orbit or something. You know, if you're macho, if you're, if you're below the sucker out, that's just the loan approach, I guess. I forgot it been hawking and we came to an MMA guy here, right? Or would it Jujitsu? So though the different solutions that the problem is, yeah, we could conceivably blow the thing up. But as Americans, we're really good at blowing stuff up and we're less good at knowing where the pieces land afterwards.

Speaker 3:          01:20:56       So I don't want to blow this thing into six pieces and still have all those six pieces headed towards earth. Right. All right, so the kinder, gentler solution is to deflect it from harm's way and there's something called a gravitational tractor beam essentially. I mean, that's the poetic way to say the Saifai way to say it, but really you, you put up a space pod out there that has a gravitational field that attracts slowly, attracts the asteroid into a slightly different orbit. And if you get there early enough, you don't have to deflect it by much because that deflection accumulates and all you needed to do is Miss Earth. Now it's still out there to harm you another day. But if you get good at this, you just have, you know, just like you have the, the block protection nighttime protection force, you know, in the neighborhood.

Speaker 3:          01:21:43       Well, you'd have the asteroid protection for us and that would be protecting earth from asteroids. And Jupiter protects us from most asteroids. Right? Well for most of the things that haul their way in from outside the solar system comets, most asteroids are within the orbit of Jupiter. So Jupiter doesn't need to protect us from them. Well, we, we would want it to. It just doesn't because they know their orbits don't reach Jupiter for enough to Jupiter to bat it into a new place. But comments that come from far, far beyond the orbit of Jupiter, Jupiter's, they, when they come near Jupiter, they feel Jupiter's titanic gravitational field and Jupiter basically bends them into a new orbit. And so many of them don't even make it past Earth's orbit on its way towards the Sun. I mean, they, so these new orbits clears the space for our survival here on earth.

Speaker 3:          01:22:32       And so Jupiter is our friend. It's, it's our, it's our friend that takes care of the bullies in the school yard. Do we know enough about, uh, other solar systems to know whether or not this is a typical setup? It was our urge, given what's called the Copernican principle to say that we're not special, where average and if we're average than other solar systems should look like us because the sun is kind of average and you know, we're not on the little list planet or the biggest planet you just so you make some some assumptions. As the star systems came into the catalogs, as our techniques and methods to observe other planets in the solar system arose, we started to learn that our solar system is not typical, that most solar systems, most star systems have a Jupiter size object much closer to their host star.

Speaker 3:          01:23:23       Then our Jupiter is. So then we say, well way, well then why is our star system different from theirs? And so it's a frontier. It's an active frontier and no one is putting their bets on any one kind of solar system as being the most representative. And, and we're, we're building the catalog now. So, so the catalog that has 700 or so exoplanets in it, that's only 500 star systems met, we're, we're now building the catalogs of the secondary tertiary planets in the star systems that we've already discovered. So that's quite a lot of binary star systems as well, right? Where there's more than one son. Oh, well first, if you look up at the night sky, almost half of all the dots of light you see, if you pull out a telescope will reveal themselves to be binary or triple star systems. It is a, it is as common as the breeze in the universe with the challenge here is what happens to a planet in orbit around a binary or multiple star system.

Speaker 3:          01:24:20       That's the challenge. And is the atmosphere stable enough to support that? That would be a concern no matter where the planet is. But here's the challenge with a multi star star system as the planet orbits, maybe it'll get really close to one star and really far from another, and maybe the orbit is entangled between the two of them trying to do figure eights, that if you have an unstable orbit, you're likely to eject the planet forever into interstellar space. And in fact, data are now showing that interstellar space may have more rogue planets that had been ejected at for having misbehaved orbits from their star system than there are stars within planetary systems themselves. Blew my fucking mind. They're called rogue planets. No, no. Let me, no, I didn't even know. No, I, I'm just beginning here. So Watch. So we also know that many planets have still retained their heat of formation long after they, they've, they've come into existence.

Speaker 3:          01:25:23       Earth still has heat churning a source of energy that is not traceable to the sun. This is what creates the magma that's sitting below Earth's crust. The son didn't eat that. That's heat generated within the earth. Some is leftover from formation. Others is created from radioactive decay of elements. But we've got an energy source and our biology books from decades ago said, life needs sunlight. No, no, no, no. Life needs energy. It doesn't care if it comes from the sun and all Kanick vents at the bottom of the sea with no sunlight. For example, the the Juan de Fuca Ridge off of the coast of, of Washington is a vent in the bottom of the ocean that is releasing the heat from below and it's an energy source. It's at the bottom of the ocean where the, where the sun don't shine, where the sun don't reach, and yet there's life form thriving.

Speaker 3:          01:26:19       Their existing on a form of Geo chemical energy. It's got nothing to do with the son. The fact that we've discovered exotic life on earth has broadened the net that we have cast into space in our search for life in the universe. No longer do we need to look for the 72 degree pond in an oxygen atmosphere planet in our search for life. It so this goldilocks zone where everything had to be perfect. We've got life thriving in places that would kill us. And we are not the measure, the ultimate measure of what the conditions that life requires to survive. So now that we're looking with this very broad net, we can say to ourselves for these vagabond planets, if they still have their source of energy churning within, maybe there's life there. And if that's the case, the galaxy could be teeming with life.

Speaker 3:          01:27:16       And the fact that we're focusing our search on planets around stars may simply be limiting all that we can discover in the cosmos. So these planets could essentially be spaceships filled with life forms headed our way and they might even slam into us. Well, metaphorical space ships. Yeah. And the problem is since they're, they're homeless, there's nothing to eliminate them. So their pitch black fly into the galaxy. And now if some of the heat reaches the surface, you can use infrared telescopes that might pick them up. But we don't, we wouldn't even know where to look. Well, isn't that the thought about the, uh, the object that they believe is somewhere outside of the Kuyper belt? Is that what I say it wiper Kuyper. Yeah. Yeah, so this is an astronomer and mid 20th century who hypothesized that beyond the outermost planet, they would be sort of the leftovers of the solar system that didn't collect into a bonafide red blooded planet, but it should still, the residue should still be out there because if you're a residue in an orbit where red blooded planet exists, you're going to collide with that planet.

Speaker 3:          01:28:26       Eventually you're going to merge with the planet and make that planet even bigger. This is one of the failed criteria for Pluto being classified as a planet because it is in a zone in the solar system that has not cleared its orbit. It is in the Kuyper belt in the inner edge of it. Yes, but it is. It is. It is joined by countless thousands of other icy bodies. Earth. Yes, we plow through crap in the, in our, in our orbit, but it's, it is the ratio of the mass of the stuff we plow into to mass is like gnats flying into an elephant. All right? It doesn't knock over the elephant. It is of no concern to the elephant. Anything that could still possibly collide with us earth won't even care, will care because it'll affect the echo system. But Earth, the planet is so much more massive than anything we would ever collide with.

Speaker 3:          01:29:20       From now to the end of the solar system, we have basically cleared our orbit of anything dangerous Pluto has not. So that was a damning fact in the ruling that got demoted from planet to planet, that it doesn't have enough mass to attract all the other objects that are nearby and neither does anything else. And so it's just a swarm of comments. The Kuyper belt of comments. So now if you go beyond the Kuiper belt, you're so far from the sun. If you're going to talk to us, it would be through reflected sunlight. But he's so far away. Yeah, it's the [inaudible]. These things are really dark objects to begin with. So how do they find them? Well, it'd be hard. So it's possible you can have a big object. Well beyond the Kuyper belt. It would just be really hard to find. Um, and I can say without, without hesitation that if there's a huge objects out there, it's gravity is of no consequence to anything that's going on between us and the Kuyper belt. I just thought it was fascinating because the idea was that there was a Jupiter sized planets so far outside of our solar system or what we consider our solar system, that it was causing some sort of a gravitational effect on the Kuyper belt. Knows what you might be remembering is, uh, the nemesis object. What does that, okay. You didn't anybody remember him? Okay, now, now I'm feeding your my doom and gloom. You're doing let the record show the man's eyebrows moved up into his forehead.

Speaker 3:          01:30:46       So, um, there was an analysis of the extinction episodes in the history of the earth that suggested that perhaps they were episodic or periodic, every sort of 20 million years or so. There was a little dip in the fossil record and we said, well, all right, you know, by the way, geologists look for indicators in the fossil record and in the rock record to demark where one error, one period, one epoch begins. And another one ends. So for example, the dinosaurs croaked at the beginning, Eh, 65 million years ago at the KT boundary, it's got some other name lately. I haven't kept up with that, but that boundary, they knew it was a boundary. So they dated, they called that a different geologic, um, zone that which followed 65 million years ago compared to that which came before it and did they did that long before they knew what the hell happened there.

Speaker 3:          01:31:40       We would later learn that an asteroid struck and there might've been there, surely worse, some super volcano activity, uh, and it would've called the Deccan traps. And so there's a lot of bad stuff going on in the earth at that time. So it was a hostile to life. We lost 70% of the world's life species in that period of time, right? 65 million years ago was devastating. So, uh, the, the awesome for us because that's how we hear, right? Yeah. In fact, flowering plants, so asteroids are a friend. They reset the world. They had a fucked up environment. It was a bad neighborhood. Dinosaurs were everywhere. We bad for us. We were just wrapped. We were scurrying underfoot as early rodents. Yes. And we were just hors d'oeuvres for t racks basically. And you take them out of the ecological niche, we can then aspire to, to evolve to something more interesting than a treat, something that can consider the Kuyper belt test.

Speaker 3:          01:32:34       And so, so, so it was imagine that maybe there's an object out there that's so far away, you can't see it, but it's on this huge looping orbit that comes by the Sun every 20 million years because that's the cycle of these extinction episodes. And if that's the case, no, it doesn't hit us. It has to stay around for the next cycle. So what does it do? It has a gravitational field that perturbs these outer comets and sends a reign of comments down into the inner solar system, creating impact extinctions on a cycle of every 20 million years. This was proposed back in the 1980s but it's not an object that anyone has ever seen. It's an object whose existence was in inferred for or, or asserted based on the record of extinction in the fossil record of further analysis of the fossil record doesn't actually hold up this cyclical extinction pattern.

Speaker 3:          01:33:32       It's more, it's more erratic than that. And so you can't really, so it's, it's evaporated as a, as an idea, but it was clever and, and intriguing and got a lot of headlines at the time. I think it's the same thing that I'm, what I read, what I read was from 2010, it was something about the Oort cloud who o r t cloud. Yeah. That's a, that's a swarm swarm of comets and not quite halfway to the nearest star, but very far out there. That is the sort of the outer reaches of the gravitational grasp of the sun. This is the case. If you go much beyond that, you're gravitational allegiances uncertain and you could fall into the next star, uh, rather than fall towards the sun. The guys were, I don't know if you've heard of these guys. Astrophysicist John mattise and Daniel Whitmore from the University of Louisiana came up with a theory that said that something smaller than a Jovian mass would not be strong enough to perform this task.

Speaker 3:          01:34:22       They believe that there's something up to 25% of them. Okay? It's four times as big as Jupiter could be responsible for sending these objects in our direction. This is just a random theory that these guys put together. It wasn't completely accepted what they're doing. What? No, no, no, no. There's no, there's no known such object what you, what people are doing, and I don't fault them for it. It's creative. It would make awesome science fiction. Storytelling is, there's something you need to explain here on earth. Somebody went extinct. There were some wave of comments. There's some observation that never repeated. There's some thing you got to come up with and so you say, well, we know the Oort cloud exists. We know you can perturb those orbits and, and send them careening down towards the inner solar system and those, that Jupiter doesn't bat away like batting practice, those that get through Jupiter's gravitational shield could wreak havoc on earth.

Speaker 3:          01:35:18       Yeah. Yeah. But that's, it's, it's, it's, it's inventing a lot to explain something you don't know. Right. So it's inventing more of what you don't know. That could be true to explain what you don't write that which you don't have any other evidence to support. So it's fun speculation, fund speculation. Exactly. Beyond that to saying, oh, it's real, it must be happening. No, no. It's just let someone write a good Scifi story on it. Here's what's fun about it and this is why I bring it up. Um, most people I've talked to this about this subject to many, many people and, uh, I, myself personally, I'm not immune to this. I find it very fascinating. However, how much have I looked into the actual planets that we absolutely know are real? Not that much, but I'm worried about this fucking fake planet that may or may not exist, do they might've found another planet.

Speaker 3:          01:36:08       It's this idea of something hidden and mysterious, which is so compelling and attractive. Nothing fascinating. Psychological observation. It's a weird thing. We want to believe there's something mysterious that we don't understand and could be there, but we don't know anything about yet where there's plenty of things we do know something about, but we want to know more. Why don't you help? Yes. All right. And by the way, the universe is far more wondrous than anything we can imagine. And so, so to say, I need your creativity and you know, uh, to, to keep your life interesting. No, we got black holes that are flaying stars layer by layer. We've got, do you realize that if you fall into a black hole, you will see the entire future of the universe unfold in front of you in a matter of moments. And you will emerge into another space time created by the singularity of the black hole you just fell into.

Speaker 3:          01:37:07       He just broke the, broke the Hogan and that right there. So, so let's talk about that. All right. Yeah. You know, why are we wasting time talking about whether the Saturn five rocket, I mean, cause we're fascinated by shit that's unproven, mysterious shit. Look, I got a broken brain. Okay? There's a reason for me. You want some more cool stuff? All right. Mars once had liquid running water coursing on its surface unquestionably has geologic Marzel logic. Features that are, are, are, are, are, are Vic, the correspond in every way to the geologic features. You see when you fly over the Mississippi River, you see, you see tributaries leading to larger rivers. You see me hindering pathways. You See River deltas at the, at the end of the river basin, you see lake beds, you see all of this. But Mars is bone dry. Today something happened to the water.

Speaker 3:          01:38:00       We don't know what we're pretty sure it's sunk down beneath the surface and a kind of permafrost. My point is if anytime in the past Mars had liquid running water, every place on earth, there's liquid running water, there's life. There is evidence to think that Mara's was habitable with liquid running water before earth was. We'll see. Then you just started up another conspiracy theory. That's the Richard Hoagland Group of people that believe that there was pyramids and a face on Mars and there was civilization. I have something better than that. All right? That if Mars was fertile for life before earth, something we learned recently in the last 10 years, that asteroid impacts Panspermia. There you go. I can be strong. It can be violent enough that they can fling surrounding rocks with escape philocity into interplanetary space where they will drift until they are attracted by the gravity of some other planet and they will then fall and land on its surface.

Speaker 3:          01:39:05       If Mars was fertile and formed life microbial, though it may only have been it's microbial life that can survive dehydration, high radiation, absence of con, we have found what we call extreme of files on earth. Like I, like I said a moment ago, that that thrive under conditions that would kill us. High pressure, low pressure, high temperature, low temperature, high radiation, uh, all of these conditions the microbes would have encountered on Mars bidding, thrust into space and making that journey well, if that's possible. And if that's the case, then life on earth could have been seeded by life on Mars making every life form on earth, a descendant of Martians. More importantly, why do we have bacteria that could survive high radiation in the first place? What business does that have here beneath Earth's protective atmosphere? Thriving in places where there isn't high radiation, we have life forms that can survive.

Speaker 3:          01:40:22       What that trip through space would have subject, what a trip through space would would've, what it would have been subjected to by a trip through space. So you have it on now, by the way, life does not evolve the way anyone typically thinks it does. You're not some organism that then adapts to a new environment. No, you just die. The variation in organisms allows some to thrive in conditions that would otherwise kill you. And it's my genetic offspring that continue. Nobody adapted to anything. Nature is selecting that subset of the variation in a generation that has survival properties for that next assault in the environment. So if Mars is teeming with life and microbes are flying into the atmosphere, flying into space as stowaways and the nooks and crannies of rocks, then that population will be selected for those microbes that can survive that journey through space.

Speaker 3:          01:41:25       Does a planet need any sort of an atmosphere in order to support life or they just need water? Uh, all we know is what can support life as we know it, right? All right. I don't know if we're inventive enough to invent other kinds of life form, but life as we know, it requires liquid water because that, that is allows nutrients to move through our vessel that we call our, our bodies. And right on down to microorganisms. We all thrive and use liquid water and we need a, a heat source. And more specifically a heat gradient. There has to be a place where there's more energy in one place than somewhere else. When you have a gradient, then you can create and sustain life as we know it. Without that, there's no known way to do it. So the entropy laws work against you to make life so.

Speaker 3:          01:42:14       So your point is that these, it's possible that organisms could be growing even on asteroids then. Oh, sorry. So your point was do we need an atmosphere? Yeah. Well, Le recent evidence suggests that possibly more than half of the mass of biology, the biomass of earth lives and thrives beneath earth's surface, not on its surface. If that's the case, what's going on in the atmosphere is relatively irrelevant. If you're thriving deep within a nook and cranny of a rock my mile down, uh, you know, don't they have some air down? Yeah, yeah, there's some air. But you know, it's not cycling with what's going on in our air, you know, so the rules become broader or, or, or altered from what you would presume the life requires. So to talk about a planet being habitable, we should no longer think only of what the surface of that planet supplies.

Speaker 3:          01:43:20       We need to think more broadly about what could go on deep within its surface as well. We're pretty sure there are no large macroscopic organisms lumbering around like an journey to the center of the Earth, uh, of Jules Verne where they're creatures down there, you know, no hollow earth. Yeah. Hollow Earth. Now there's no evidence that we have huge creatures. The pressures and the behavior of material doesn't allow there to be huge cavities that haven't over the billions of years completely been filled in. When I say huge, I mean, you know, uh, you know, hundreds of miles large, no, the, the system would collapse into that rapidly and you can get smaller cabinet like Carlsbad caverns, that sort of thing. But, but nothing, you know, a staggeringly large now when you consider all the possibilities for life in the universe, which are, you know, almost infinite, right? Yeah. They're probably more ways to make life than we haven't thought of then the way to make life that is, that we know of, you know, here on earth w it would just not imaginative.

Speaker 3:          01:44:26       We just don't, uh, you know, I'm reminded of if I get a little literate on you for the moment, uh, in, uh, the late 18th century, there's a book published called Cosmo Pharaohs by um, a Christian Huggins. And he was a, he was a polymath that he was a great in math and physics and biology. He wrote a book exploring what life might be like on all the planets and listen to this reasoning. This is, this is hilarious. He said Jupiter, well, it's clear it's got an atmosphere because through a telescope you see bands of gas moving across its surface. Well, if it has an atmosphere, then life forms, they're a, would probably exploit that atmosphere the way we do because it has an atmosphere. It means it probably has rain because we get rain out of habit. Our atmosphere, if it has rain, it must have oceans.

Speaker 3:          01:45:19       If it has oceans, they must need a means for gathering, for traveling. So they would build ships with sales, and if those ships have sales, they would need rope. So they probably have him. Wow. So this was obviously extrapolation to an extreme. Right. But just it analyze that for one split second, every supposition was founded rooted in what we do as humans and there's no greater hubris than to presume that what we find somewhere else would be just like us or act just like us or have the same needs as us. I always felt that way about, or even have the same number of senses as us. They could have fewer, they could have more. Hmm. Think about how much of our lives are influenced, how much of our society is built on services that bring pleasure to our senses, our sense of touch. We can go, you go get a massage. Damn right. You can know the right place. Our, our sense of taste. There is food brought to x high cuisine, right? Our sense of hearing. Sure. We make beautiful music, our sense of sight. We make great art. So much of what we do is to satisfy our five traditional senses. Imagine if we had 10 senses or 20 I have a theory on that. It's called the fart principle. I have no understanding of how that principal could relate to this, but

Speaker 1:          01:46:50       I'm all yours. So this is why, um, if you did not have a nose and you could live your whole life without a sense of smell in the year 2012, it's very possible if you, if someone farted in front of you, you'd have no idea that this terrible gas is, you're inhaling, it's in your, no, you wouldn't have that sense of smell. Okay. So you could exist and not have any idea because gas is invisible. Okay. That's a bad example. And I'll tell you why. It's okay. No, no. I'll tell you why. Could be alien life form all around us all the time that we don't have the sense to like, it's like worms can't see.

Speaker 3:          01:47:24       So two things. So first, uh, it's a, it's a good example in the sense that no pun intended in the sense of that without, if who knows what senses were missing and therefore who knows what there is to measure in our world around us that we are completely missing. Right. All right. I'll get back to that in a minute. Regarding your FARC theory. Yes. Here's the problem. All right. The my theories of for peer review, right? That it is totally getting peer reviewed. The good. Nice. It's the right thing to call it too. It's a legitimate hypothesis. Thank you. It's out on the table now. Here you go. You Ready? It's my last, uh, one of the active ingredients in the smell of a fart is hydrogen sulfide. It turns out hydrogen sulfide is extremely lethal, is one of the most lethal gasses that exists.

Speaker 3:          01:48:16       Well, why do we have such a good sense of smell for that? Why don't we smell other get, why don't we smell nitrogen? [inaudible] well, we don't need to smell nitrogen because it's not going to kill us because it's 78% of what you breathe. Anyway. [inaudible] we have evolved a hypersensitive sense for the smell of hydrogen sulfide. If, if, if there was a gender, if you gave birth to someone who said, hydrogen sulfide smells beautiful and let's smell more of it, let's get canisters of it. If you're dead 10 minutes later, no longer able to propagate the gene that liked the smell of hydrogen sulfide. We had to not like that smell. Otherwise we would not have survived the, uh, by the way, hydrogen sulfide is a byproduct of the, the digestive activity of anaerobic microbes. That's why it comes out of your lower intestine with not only where the sun don't shine, where oxygen doesn't exist, the microbes to thrive down there, they are an aerobic and hydrogen sulfide is one of their byproducts.

Speaker 3:          01:49:35       It has been theorized that there have been places and times on earth where the ocean currents stopped. And when ocean current stop oxygen at the surface of the ocean never makes it to the bottom. So you can't sustain oxygen lifeforms at the bottom of the ocean. There are no fish. There wouldn't be any fishes down there if the ocean currents stopped because the ocean currents not only go from one place to another in the world they circle, they circulate top to bottom. All right? So it's a two dimensional thing going on at three dimensions actually. So, so if something happens on earth where you stopped the oceanic cycles, you can create a condition in the lower ocean. We're anaerobic lifeforms thrive. If they thrive, they out gas and one of the out gases is hydrogen sulfide. It will gurgle up from the bottom of the ocean, rise up near the shores, turning shorelines into the smell of cesspools. If you were alive at the time and didn't run away from that, you would have simply died from it.

Speaker 1:          01:50:44       That is all well and good. Therefore, the nose, the nose theory that if we didn't have a nose, we could all just fart and we didn't have a nose. We wouldn't have noticed hydrogen sulfide and humans would not have survived it and some other creature would be having this interview right now. I agree with you and disagree with you. At the same time, it's a, here's why what you're saying involves real people and real life adaptation to our environment. What I'm talking about is aliens that are just like farts. That's why so you gave me a crazy long winded, really an in depth explanation, but you still don't discredit the possibility that just like the sense of smell. It exists, but it is invisible. There could be many things around us that are also invisible, but we have not developed any means to detect that. Okay. You were being metaphor. She works right? Wifi. Yeah. Wait, wait, wait. So you're being metaphorical with your father sang live. No one would have had to have a known artist says, I overanalyze you are a theory.

Speaker 1:          01:51:56       That was cool. It was cool. By the way, one global warming scenario is the currents. Yes. Did you see the day after tomorrow? Did you see that? Unbelievably horrible. Yeah. That one was, was that went to no clothes. So good. It was bad when there was the cancer baby and everybody else is dead outside, but there she's surviving with the cancer baby and she's going to stay there for the kid. We, while 100 billion people are dead. It's an awesome, awesome. Let me get back to your nose. Your partner is crazy. Okay, so now here's why.

Speaker 3:          01:52:25       You're probably not right.

Speaker 1:          01:52:27       Well, I'm definitely not right. Look, it's a ridiculous idea. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. But there's a reason

Speaker 3:          01:52:32       why you're probably not. Right. Okay. Because beginning in the 16 hundreds, we learned that our senses are not only, they not fool us, they and occasionally don't work. They're not all that the universe tells us they are not. They don't have the capacity to recognize all that's going on in the universe will certainly on a microscopic level. Well, that's my point. That's my point. So in the early 16 hundreds to the important advances, uh, actually late 1500, you had the invention of the microscope and you had the invention of the telescope. This is really the first steps to enhance our senses beyond what our human biology in doubt us with. And upon doing so, we discovered things about the world that were previously oblivious to us. We discovered knows farts. When Lou, you wouldn't leave. Windhoek brought his telescope of his microscope to UB drop of pond water and saw what we were called Anna macules.

Speaker 3:          01:53:50       What else were you going to call the little things? Paramecium had protozoa thriving in a drop of water. That was a nose fart. Good con keeping with your vocabulary. That was something that previously no one had any idea was there. And my point is beginning in 1600 and with an ever improving march forward, the methods and tools of science have served to enhance our senses, increase our senses, increased the range of our senses, but more importantly, give us whole kinds of senses that your five senses could have never even imagined that our human biology couldn't even approximate. So as so, so what's an example? Um, yeah. Uh, we don't have senses to detect magnetic field at all. That's why you can sit in a Mri Chamber and sit there and you know, whistle Dixie and you'll have no idea the strength of the magnetic field that's being cast across your body.

Speaker 3:          01:54:55       We don't have sensors for it. You don't have sensors for radio? Uh, we're radio waves. What the, the difference there is we do have sensors for one aspect of the electromagnetic spectrum. We have sensors for infrared visible and a delayed sense for ultraviolet. Does that mean, oh wow. Sorry. That's pretty loud. And creative ringtone. Just like mine aren't dangerous. He goes, oh yeah. Uh, so, uh, so the point is the radio waves are part of the entire electromagnetic spectrum. We, we have access to some of that and we call that for obvious reasons, visible light. But outside of the range of visible light, you have ultraviolet x rays, gamma rays, radio waves, microwaves. So yes, we see radio waves, but that would just be an extension of our senses in the way Jordy and star Trek, the next generation had his visor though that visor allowed him to see the entire go star track.

Speaker 3:          01:55:55       I got it. I had to go there just because I had, uh, and my sideburns or star Trek sideburns. I don't know if he, uh, so he puts the, well, he, that visor enabled him to see the entire electromagnetic spectrum. If we were thusly equipped, you'd walk down the street and the microwave towers would be a blaze with microwaves and you tune into sort of ultraviolet. And if you, you think twice about going to the beach because that's the stuff that gives you skin cancer, especially people with lighter skin. If you, if, um, if you want to see, uh, what would it be? A good example if you want to see if there's a burglar entering your house, just shift over to infrared. If the burglar is warm blooded, they will show up even if all the lights are out, like the Predator. Uh, exactly, exactly.

Speaker 3:          01:56:39       It's another way to detect the light. So, so we have, so science has broadened our senses and given us senses that are human biology could not have even thought of or invented. So the notion at this day and age that something is happening on this tabletop that is eluding us, I think is just simply unlikely because we're so good now at finding things that previously, uh, escaped our notice right in front of us right now. That frontier is that the energy extremes of the cern accelerator in Switzerland. That frontier is at the James Webb space telescope where we're going to look at the earliest formation of matter in the history of the universe. These are the extremes of our measurements of nature today. The biological limitations of human beings, uh, the birth and the death. You know, the fact that we are all born and we all die.

Speaker 3:          01:57:39       Do we apply those to the universe for a reason or do we know that there was a birth? Is that, is that 100% sure that had before the big bang there was no, but there was something. So do we know that? Yeah. So we don't know. We don't know what happened before the Big Bang. So that's my first and highest level answer to you. That doesn't mean some people don't have some creative ideas, but the only real answer is we don't know. And we have top people working on it. All right, so now some of the creative ideas are quantum physics, which is the most successful theory of physics there ever was. Quantum theory tells us that the early universe may have been a fluctuation in the laws of physics, allowing other fluctuations at the same time so that we are, but one bubble of many comprising an infinite set of bubbles deserving the retrospectively obvious name multiverse.

Speaker 3:          01:58:47       The multiverse theories a scare the multiverse. And so if there's a multiverse then, then we're just one bubble and this multiverse is just churning them out. Some of them by the way, who were on a one way expansion trip. Other universities, the laws of physics might be slightly different with a condition. The initial conditions might be slightly altered from ours and it would expand it and we collapse. They'd have a big squeeze at the end. Some universities might might be created without any matter at all. So you have a universe with no one to contemplate it. We happen to have a universe with a matter and energy within it assembled and achieved consciousness. So a universe where there's no matter at all, but it's infinite and self comprised like it is the universe. You can't get here from there. And not that we know of, but that could be a way we might be able to invent the multiverse transport kit where you leave your universe and enter another other.

Speaker 3:          01:59:44       But I don't recommend that because if the laws, if the laws of physics are even slightly different, the charge on the electron, the, the mass of the neutron, if any of these are slightly different than everything that holds you together, all the physical laws that come together to make you, including all the forces of nature, they would just completely collapse in the existence if you stepped into the zone of this other universe where they take on some other form or shape that we can't even imagine. So yeah, I don't want to, I, I, you know, that's when he flipped. You send in a probe or something, but you don't send yourself. So that's why I joke about this half seriously, that if an alien comes to visit, I want to make sure in advance that they're not made of anti-matter. So I flipped a coin and that catch it.

Speaker 3:          02:00:38       If they don't explode together in isolation, then I'll shake their hands. So let him mad. I say welcome to Earth. When they explode, just touching the ground then. Ah, yeah. Well they might have hover, hover, glide or something, you know, I don't lie. Well, plus they're touching the atmosphere, which is matter. So, so if I meet him in space, let's say [inaudible] and you shake hands, everybody dies. You completely an island. That's correct. Yeah. So that's what happens in our own universe. Imagine, uh, some other universe. There's no telling. How are laws of physics would interact with each other. So you ask what's before the universe? It may be the multiverse, but now, now, now when you played that thing, I get nervous. So there's, there's good, there's cogent physics reasons to think that there's a multiverse and quantum physics. It takes us there. There's also good philosophical reason to think that there's a multiverse because in our experience, discovering the cosmos, the universe never makes anything in ones when we thought earth is it.

Speaker 3:          02:01:40       No earth is just one of many other planet. Well, the sun is, but no sun is one of 100 billion stars in the galaxy. Well, the Milky Way, and I know there's 100 billion other galaxies in the universe. Well, the universe, well, we'd been there before, right? Right. Am I going to say there's one universe? I'm a little, I'm all Stanley. Isn't there? Just one university? We'll get verse consisting of billions and billions of infant. I'm getting there. So what's, so watch the vocabulary, right? So we have this one universe, but I don't want to think there's one universe because of the trend line says differently. All right, so maybe there's this multiverse. Well that just continues to push the question a little deeply. If the universe never makes, if the, if the, this entity never makes anything in ones, then why would it only make one multiverse takes us. So then, so, so maybe there are multiple multiverses.

Speaker 3:          02:02:44       Okay, so that would, so, and then it's turtles all the way down as they say. So, so we, like I said, we don't have a handle on it yet, but we have, we've solved other origin problems because what started this was your question about birth and death. There's a time and we didn't know how the earth began. We have a good idea of that now and how are the, how the moon foreign, we've got that, how the sun formed. We got that. No, we weren't around 5 billion years ago to watch it. But you don't need to be, they're very clever ways to know what happened in the past. Geologist had been doing it, but you know, ever since the field was born, you have, there's a, there's a record writ for geologists in the rocks telling you where they've been, what temperature they were exposed to and how long they've been sitting there.

Speaker 3:          02:03:30       We look at the sun. No, we can't go back in time with it, but we can look at other stars. We, we look out in the galaxy. There's so many stars, but catching some being born but catching others dying. We're catching some in orbit around each other and we're seeing some that don't exist anymore because by the time they're light reaches us, they've already faded out. There'll be some of them that in fact at this instant, no longer exist and that information has yet to reach us. That's insane. And by the way, that happens several hundred times a year. We observe what are called supernovae stars that ask you about stars that explode. We watched them explode and we date them from when we see them explode. But hell, they'd exploded long ago, depending on their distance, if there are thousand light years away, they exploded a thousand years ago. It was, you had no knowledge of it until today.

Speaker 3:          02:04:17       There was a fantastic documentary on hyper novas and it was so mind boggling because they went back to the birth of the discovery of hyper Novas. And when they initially were theorizing that it was warfare in space, I'll tell you what that story was. So in the 1970s after the United States and Russia, the Soviet Union signed a test ban treaty where you couldn't test nuclear weapons on her surface. Uh, we, you know, there's the old military, uh, Credo Trust, but verify. We said, all right, we'll sign this treaty, but we're gonna keep on eye on you. So we got together the engineers and the physicist and we may, my, my brethren of the day, uh, invented a telescope, a kind of detector that was sensitive to gamma rays. That's one of these bands in the electromagnetic spectrum, the highest energy band for which we have a word to describe it.

Speaker 3:          02:05:10       Gamma rays, by the way, that's what Dr Banner was exposed to that made a, Oh, don't you think I'm not aware. Big, green and ugly. So actually that's not actually what would happen to you if you're exposed to Mac, but we'll give the comics of the, the, the scientific latitude. So, so you have this, um, so, so, so what happens? So they launched this detector and you know, seven, eight, nine, 10 times a week, this satellite with this detector on board detects burst of gamma rays and the Pentagon scrambled and they said, you know, what's, what's going on? Are they actually detonating these weapons? And they looked at satellite, other satellite, secondary, tertiary information. So he union was silent. There was no evidence of any nuclear testing at all. And that was the birth that day to the day of the publication of that paper that reported on these daily bursts.

Speaker 3:          02:06:05       That was the birth of the field of astrophysics called gamma ray astronomy. And we now have other gamma ray telescopes out there studying these. They are explosions and they're happening at the edge of the universe. And these are the sorts, the, their sources are of what you're hyper Novae. We needed a word bigger than supernovae and we, these are the biggest explosions known in the universe. And so we call them hyper Novi and the amount of power produced by a hyper Nova. Oh yeah. It's extraordinary. What, uh, what matters more than that, it's a lot of power is that it's very focused. It comes out in two beams, one in one direction and one in the other. And if we happen to be in the beam, that's, that's all she wrote. Yeah. If there were a hyper Novi anywhere in our galaxy, everybody's done in the entire galaxy and it was being towards earth.

Speaker 3:          02:06:52       We're toast, literal and figurative. Literally around that kids, there's $100 billion stars at least. Right. And this galaxy. But most, I mean a hyper, no, it was a very special and rare kind of star. And we times a day, we now well know in the universe. Yeah. No, eight times. Eight times a week. Eight times a week. Yeah. Yeah. Between 75 times a week. Once a day in the entire universe. Wow. So, so, so that, that's, but that tells you how rare it is. It takes 150 to 100 billion galaxies, each with 100 billion stars to give you hate. Are these a week? Yeah. So by the way, there's an interesting way that this will render us toast. So the first rave of gamma rays, we'll take out our ozone layer. The ozone absorbs high, high energy radiation. That's what PR protects us from. Uh, it's what absorbed most of the ultraviolet from the sun.

Speaker 3:          02:07:47       Otherwise, ultra is hostile to life, to life on the surface. And we wouldn't be life as we know it if without this ozone layer on earth. All right? So, so if, but you can overrun the ozone layer. The ozone is oxygen. It's o three, right? The air you breathe has o two in it. The molecule [inaudible] ozone is both three and ultra violet photon comes in, slams into o three breaks it apart into o plus o two. There you go. It ups, it took the, the ultraviolet light out of the, out of the picture, it's gone. That's why protects us. Okay, so if there's a gamma ray burst, more high energy, photons will hit us. Then there are oh three molecules in our ozone layer. So they all hit and they break apart the o threes and it's like the first wave of, of, of a cat.

Speaker 3:          02:08:46       What are the cavalry who the first ones on the, in the battle? Um, the first they get all shot up, right? I mean in the old fashioned they run in, they get shot up. Okay. The first way it comes in, we'd protects us from some of it, but in overruns, the ozone layer, the rest come in and basically starts breaking apart the molecular, the complex molecules that exist on earth surface. That's how high energy the light is. And generally we think of life as complex chemistry and the most complex form of chemistry we know, and so we would not survive that. That would be an extinction episode for all life on Earth and now what? Now if you, you could burrow underground, that'd be cool. Go there. I wouldn't want to, I'd rather just stop. It's just too much to ask to survive something like grab a beer, get out your lawn chair and watch it come like anything you want to survive.

Speaker 3:          02:09:39       It seems like you have to sort of give in to the reality that the greater good of the universe will be fine. It's time for the rats and roaches to rise up in ourF or whatever. Then it's like our own consciousness is so strung up on the idea of staying in this form, you know, physically alive and keep this thing, whatever. This is going right. Because of our survival instincts, it really sort of confuses and it dilutes the whole idea of perception that the universe itself is not just infinite, but infinitely fractal. Yeah. Well No. The average life expectancy of a mammal species is about 3 million years, and I'm sure there's some of us out there who are thinking that we'll live for billions of years and and planet hop and star hop, and then there are people are saying, well, we better learn how to terraform Mars because earth is about to be completely messed up. And those folks I think are misguided in their, in

Speaker 1:          02:10:34       their thinking. Can I tell you why? Sure. Please. It's not who doesn't want to terraform Mars. Okay, that's they did. They did it on. I got kids, another planet to visit. That'd be fun. Vacation, vacation spot. I have no issues, but don't do that. Be Close. You want another place to live, to escape the fact that we're destroying our own earth. All right? Did the environment and the oceans and the atmosphere. Here's why is every very simple argument. If we have the power to convert Mars into something that looks like earth, then we have the power to fix our oceans, our oceans, and our own atmosphere, right? If you see if you have the power of geoengineering, you don't have to leave the planet, your arm turn another one into earth and move there. The fixer earth. Yes, thank you. It seems like just a step in the stage of innovation.

Speaker 1:          02:11:24       As long as human beings have access to energy, we're going to figure out how to get energy from pollution and get energy from this going to be with the massive amounts of progress that have been made just in the last 200 years. I always like to describe to people if they really have a hard time wrapping their head around it that 200 years ago if you wanted a picture of something you had to draw it. I'll just stop and look at that. Great, great observation. It's such a small amount of time that a massive amount of stuff has happened and if you stop and think about what we're capable of like [inaudible] man, who knows? I mean, I don't know the answer to overpopulation. I don't know the answer, but I do know that I would've never figured out why Phi on my own. I would've never figured out how to send a satellite signal.

Speaker 1:          02:12:05       Who the fuck even understands what's going on. When you get online, it's just think about what's going on in your car's gps. Right? So it's talking to a satellite and mixing your location on earth surface with information that's in the later versions of it on your car, updated from the Internet about what direction the traffic flows on a street you happened to be driving on and whether the Dunkin donuts is open late. Yeah. As long as there's money in fixing the environment, we're going to fix the environment. Well that's the challenge. The trick is to make it so that people can actually find some benefit in a capitalist economy. That's, that's the driver of it all. Yeah. It pushes things and it also, you know, it leaves a lot of bullshit in its wake and a lot of pollution and problems that, I mean, I hope we figure it out before we eat up the rain forest.

Speaker 1:          02:12:58       I really do. But if we don't, we could probably make a new rain forest one day. We could probably figure it out. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, it's a fucked up way to look at things like, well figure it out, don't worry. But I think the doom and gloom analysis of we're doomed. There's no way we're going to, uh, we're gonna run out of food. I think that's kind of a silly way to look at it too. I think it seems to me that if you fly over just the United States alone, God is a lot of space to do shit. Yeah, that's correct. And if you wanted to do some shit on the moon or on Mars, he could kind of do it in Nevada as well. You know, you could find some spots, Utah and nobody's

Speaker 3:          02:13:32       there and you could put up a dome and grow some vegetables. What happened is earth keeps warming. So the news that last year was by far the longest that the warmest year ever by far a 2012 the warmest year on earth. So if that want warm as here for, since when, uh, I, well, I didn't read the full depth of the article, but certainly the warmest on record, right? Is that we've been keeping records now warm. The earth has been, but, uh, not since like Jurassic, right, right. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. In any time that, that it would have been concerned about this. And so if that's unstoppable for whatever reasons, political, cultural, economic, whatever, what that will do is simply redraw the map of what does Arabelle and what is not in the world. So we'll live in Antarctica, it'll read, distribute, uh, where, where we think of as the heartland and the, the wheat, you know, well, we know about the, we know now about Greenland and underneath all that ice there.

Speaker 3:          02:14:33       Yeah. Stuff that, the climate that once was, I mean, there's a day when, uh, earth had no ice poles and no, no ice caps at all. Well, there was a day, just 15, 16,000 years ago that half of North America was covered in ice. I liked the way he said, just 15,000. I'm Craig Lawson in the version of the universe that was silly lives. And, uh, there's good evidence to say that Earth had the early earth had, was complete snowball where the ice caps were so large that the north ice cap met this south ice camp at the equator and it's called snowball earth. When was this? Very cool. I forgot the exact time that they've been. It's, it's geologist plus, you know, some, uh, w if you look at the history of the sun or the sun wasn't always the same temperature. So you have to fold that into what's going on on earth at the time and what the Greek, the state of the greenhouse effect is on earth.

Speaker 3:          02:15:23       Because that also influences the, the, the tracking, the, the, uh, how, how high the temperature is versus what earth is doing with the energy it received. When you're a snowball, most of earth, the Sun's light is reflected rather than absorbed. See that. And so that's how you can get a runaway snowball, right? So the ice caps grow a little bit and they said, we are, this is like global climate change. And the other direction, the way worse, right? It grows a little bit and then less sunlight gets absorbed by the earth because ice is white. And so it freezes up a little more. Oh. And then even less sunlight gets kept and then it freezes up a little more. So you can have a runaway ice ball just as you can have a runaway greenhouse. That's incredible. That's, that's interesting that, that these two possibilities exist.

Speaker 3:          02:16:14       And the glacier is when they melt and they create water and the water acts as a reflector and the light goes to the water and melting glaciers quicker. And so for example, if their, if their greenhouse gas is dissolved in the rocks are in the oceans and they're happy and nobody's disturbing them, then you maintain your atmospheric temperature and the energy balance of sunlight hitting the earth. Some getting absorbed, others getting other, other parts getting reflected. But if you tip that balance, by the way, that can shift, that's not a like a razor edge balance. I mean, there's no slop in there. Uh, restorative forces exist. But if you go outside of what a restorative force can give you, then you overrun the capacity to bring you back to any place where you once were and then you get a runaway phenomenon. And so you heat and when you heat something, it out gases, right?

Speaker 3:          02:17:06       If you heat your soda, the Co two comes out of it. It doesn't stay in. That's why we'd like drinking cold carbonated beverages. So if you heat earth then and greenhouse gases are, are dissolved within it, then you start releasing those greenhouse gases that makes earth retain even more. Heat makes it hotter and it makes it hotter even more greenhouse gas has come out. And so you can imagine a situation where you have a runaway greenhouse where everything goes really hot. Is that where we're at? No, it's everybody do. We're not. Runaway Earth has been this hot before and has recovered from it over time as much longer than anybody's life lifetime. That's another problem here. Right? Earth has been much harder than this. It just was much hotter before humans are much more stream. Yeah. Before human history. Yeah. And so, and we have great evidence for this.

Speaker 3:          02:17:58       So the issue is not will earth survive. It is whether we as we have set up culture and civilization and economies and, and it's all been set up assuming a certain constancy of the conduct of nature and if we now become a force in that in nature's equation, creating a cycling of phenomenon that would normally have taken 10,000 or 100,000 years and we're doing it on a scale of centuries, then we better be prepared to face those consequences. Much like your analogy of the clouds in a timelapse fashion, the idea of living by the beach would be so fucking ridiculous. If you ever saw the, the actual like Pangea change into continental. Send me the last bit. Yeah. Cause that's like why would you live near the water? What are you crazy? But that's 80% of our population. Right? Exactly. Yeah, yeah, yeah. On because cities are based typically near water, soft water sources on river mouths or, or were transportation was useful in the days before we live in New York City, in Manhattan, lower Manhattan. Are you concerned about like sandy and the impact that it had that this might flood zone a and zone Aa was four blocks from me, from my zone, which was zoned. See, I walked four blocks, five blocks away and oh, should tire underground parking garages were flooded. Cars were bobbing out, up, out of the exit doors of these parking garages. Have you thought about Utah or maybe perhaps not Colorado mountains to stay because if you plan for the end of the world, I'm going where you're going.

Speaker 1:          02:19:28       I'm going to call you up. Dude. You better be straight with me telling me where to. Hi,

Speaker 3:          02:19:32       tell you a cute story. A friend of mine, Rick Binsel, who's, uh, who's at a planetary astronomer, uh, he also created the risk scale for judging the likelihood of an asteroid that's recently, recently been discovered. He created the risk scale that will tell you the likelihood of that hitting earth. Okay. Now he and I like to drink wine when we're together. So he has, so if, if he's thinking that an asteroid is gonna come one day, what's the first thing you ask him about his wine collection? What's the first thing you ask him? Uh, what are you going to drink? Exactly what bottle of wine and you have that you're going to pull out the day, you know, the asteroid's coming. So he was thinking maybe he could attach a little, a little a sensor behind that bottle. Okay. And it goes into my place and other friends of his, so

Speaker 1:          02:20:18       pose that bottle out, I'm red light starts flashing and you know, cause he would be the first to know this. It's his calculation if it gets sent to the media that gets sent to the press. Oh, okay. Um, speaking of calculations, I have to talk to you about the conversation that you had was his, the men, the man's named Claude Shannon was that the guy knows talky, but what is the name Claude? Well, I'm trying to remember what the, uh, the scientist's name that was discovering or that, uh, was talking to you about the discovery of computers. A computer. Oh, Jim Gates. Gym. Yup.

Speaker 3:          02:20:53       Professor, uh, Jim, uh, Jim Gates. Oh, there's a professor of physics at the University of Maryland

Speaker 1:          02:21:01       in College Park Correcting Computer Code found in the computations of quantum physics, physics.

Speaker 3:          02:21:07       What the fuck does that mean? Yeah. So he found an, I don't claim expertise in everything he said. I had him on a panel. Uh, we have an annual, uh, an annual, uh, uh, event at the American Museum of natural history. That's my day job there as director of the Hayden Planetarium. Uh, and, uh, once a year we have this panel and I bring on my colleagues who are active on the bleeding frontier of some topic and I put them on stage and we all just fight about who's right or is there enough data where and where is, should I believe you should I not? And so it's the annual Isaac Asimov panel debate and it's designed to, uh, to expose an aspect of science that the public hardly ever sees. They usually see that the perfectly written paper and the news report on it and everything is tidally discovered.

Speaker 3:          02:22:00       They don't see the bloody bleeding edge where the fisticuffs. Um, come out. And so on this particular case, he, uh, Jim Gates, uh, discovered that there's a certain in our representation of the universe. Quantum theory, yes, yes. Uh, in, in, in, in the way we have come to understand the universe and our methods and tools deep down within that is necessary a code rit in Zeros and ones that is a s a particular kind of error checking, uh, algorithm that we invoke daily and the movement of data from one system to another and it's called a checksum. Or you might've seen that in an error code. If anytime an error dump happens on your screen, go look in there, you'll see the word checks on him in multiple places. It's one word checksum and it's a way to, it's like the idiot check on did this bulk of data get through this portal.

Speaker 3:          02:23:02       All right, so you know, you're looking at that sort of the gross thing you can check for, you know, how many total bits were there? I don't know if they're the right bits, but I know how many total bitch should've come. So let me check for that. So that's the kind of thing you do in a check sum. So he asserts that this exists deep within what we need to represent the operations of nature at its deepest, most fundamental levels. It is the matrix re deep and so, so all right. So that's so I, so I was astonished by this and I paused and actually there's a youtube video of me in gas. I'm interrogating him and, and now I don't know that it's seen peer review yet. I've got a [inaudible], he's a friend of mine so I can just call him up. But uh, for before you start getting excited about it or bent out of shape about it or disturbed about it, you wanted to see peer review and that the level of expertise in that analysis is above my pay scale.

Speaker 3:          02:24:05       So it's got to go to peers who do exactly that kind of mathematical physics. And if they come out with a consensus and they agree, then I'm good to go and I'll, and I'll invest more energy and coming to understand it. But for every correct idea of how the universe works, there's hundreds and in some cases, thousands of ideas that end up in the trash bin of creative thinking. And so, so I, I have to allocate my energies and my, my, my budget of time. And so it's intriguing and um, and I'm happy to know that it exists, but to take it beyond that and wax philosophically poetic about it. Maybe over a beer at a bar, but no, not, not in an actual setting where I'm talking about science. So it's, or maybe when you're hot, you know, it's great. It's great fodder for conversation when you think you're being deep, right? When you get done with your chem trails talk, that's, I'm talking about computer simulation.

Speaker 8:          02:25:00       The universe is on a hard drive. The multiverse is on a backup drive, like a raid drives. Oh, the, all the backup drives of the multiverse. That's why it doesn't have all the information as the same universe because it only takes the base so it can like back. He's going to make you dumb. If you keep going to him, he will propose some things that will ruin your brain. The computer simulation has been

Speaker 3:          02:25:24       bandied about in a bunch of different forms. And the idea being that one day we'll have infinite amounts of processing power and we will be able to create a reality that is indiscernible from this reality. And once that is done, how will we know when we're in it? And could we be in it right now? And this is sounds like more high horse shit nonsense, but this is being bandied about by some of the smartest people on the planet. Yeah, I remain unconvinced. I mean of what I've read. And you're talking about basically Kurt's while in the singularity, no, not necessarily, but it's, it folds in, so sort of requires the acceptance that the day will come where our computing power in our storage power because it's growing exponentially with Moore's law. It doubles every 18 months or so in capacity and speed and, and all the metrics that matter when you're doing. Uh, and when you're an information technology, the hypothesis that one day we can just upload our entire brain into her computer or a computer can simulate your brain in some fundamental way. Then what do we need you for if we can now just simulate it. I mean the here in La, the actor's version of that is they've just digitize your body in every angle, doing everything. What do we need you for

Speaker 1:          02:26:36       exactly what they don't and we need to get rid of most actors. They need to be outsourced. I don't think the actor's union is happy about, they can suck it. They're unnecessary humans for the most part. Some of them are beautiful and they're the, for every Samuel Jackson, you got a million Douche bags. That's reality. So that flawed institution would you say buddy? He said blue, blue cigarettes. I'll Stephen Dorff. You ever seen those ads? No. Proof of this. All La. There's a broad spectrum of intelligent life on this planet itself and you need to see the ad for blue cigarettes. It's a black and white ad where Stephen Dorff is telling you how cool it is to smoke electronic cigarettes. It's the second douchey is commercial that's ever existed. The first is Brad Pitt's Chanel number five commercial. Have you seen, I've only seen the stills and all of that.

Speaker 1:          02:27:25       You want to become a dumber person for a few more. I can show you that can make you dumber, not just slightly dumb or like 1000000th of 1% dumber. Oh, we're running out of time. Just let's show him that we'll end with stupidity. Listen, man, you're, you're a brilliant person. Thank you very much for not just being here, but for what you do. You know, even Mrs Rogan was excited that you were on the podcast today. It's a big on science as you can tell. She wants a real diamond. Tell I'll word mixed animal, smuggle one out under blindfold for, let's see, what else would I can do? Your, your passion for knowledge and your passion for distributing it. And it's, it's so infectious and it's so fascinating. And I got a lot of Twitter messages today about you coming on and a lot of them were from people who said that you ignited their passion for science and you made them pursue specific career goals. And I got to do, sent me this message about who's an engineer. I became an engineer because listening to you, I'm

Speaker 3:          02:28:19       deeply appreciative of, but let me pose that and let me analyze that in a slightly different way. I already know that the universe is an extraordinary place, but not everyone else does. So part of what I do is serve as a conduit between the curiosity in our culture that is embedded there, even if you forgotten it, because I know it's within us all because it's there in all of us when we're children, Aka, you're a bad motherfucker. I do is park the curtains for people to recognize the awesomeness of the universe that is there with or without me. Well, you have a beautiful way of looking at it and I really appreciate your humility in that, in that respect. Um, but it, that perfect storm of personality and knowledge is very rare and I just appreciate you for being who you are. And I thank you very much for being on the can I just say, you know why I'm out?

Speaker 3:          02:29:15       I'm in la now because we're, we're beginning to shoot the old things through the applause in the corner. We, we are, we are creating the next generation cosmos. A Cosmos for the 21st century. Yes. The Carl Sagan time with them all over that. But that was from 1980 it's been 33 years. So we're doing it now. It's gonna be another 13 episodes. It's cosmos, a spacetime Odyssey. Is it PBS as well? No, it's not. PBS would have a hugely larger market exposure because it's going to appear likely in primetime, but we're not sure that yet, but it's going to air on Fox. Holy Shit on Fox. A strong. That is, that's amazing. God, that's going to be so good. We've got Seth macfarlane, who's our, it's sort of broker, he, he brought us to Fox. I had, I became latter day friends with him and he's a fan of Cosmos and he loves Carl Sagan.

Speaker 3:          02:30:06       He's a fan of my work. He's a fan of wheat to hubs. The lead, a powerful Seth Macfarlane, the council. Those conversations I've had with him that perhaps some counselors conversation of, he came to it, Neil, I got to talk to you. I said, let's have lunch. We have lunch. He asked me all these questions about the big bang and the cosmic microwave background and the early universe and I said, okay, you're, you're good now. He said, yeah, I'm good. And then three months later there's an episode with Stu. We went back to the big bang and I get a full card credit at the end. His science advisor, no, I was like lunchtime entertainment for her, but it was like a science advisor episode. One of the greatest things about creating this podcast has been the opportunity to have these kinds of conversations. I could've never corralled you and said, hey man.

Speaker 3:          02:30:51       Yeah, I know the conversation. The guy who hosts the UFC and fear factor wants to sit down with you for three hours. He'd be like, yeah, tell that dude, I got shit to do. But the fact that I could pick your brain for this low, the fact that you even have this curiosity and it's and you've nurtured it in your fan base is great. So great to be on your show. Thank you. So I really, really appreciate it. And you can follow Neil on Twitter. It's a n e I l Tyson on Twitter. And follow him, you Fox and let them show them some love please. Uh, thank you very much

Speaker 1:          02:31:20       for being here. Thanks everybody for all the messages on Twitter and Facebook and all the various comedy shows, speaking of which this weekend, this Friday night, two shows, uh, here at the Ice House in Pasadena, eight 30 and 10 30 with a Ari Shaffir. You comment, you want to, you want it. I might not be around my house and posting lined up, but I'm me and Ari will be there and we'll probably have some other local guys, whoever's in town, I think Callans and towel. I'll get him to come by. But uh, we're here. We're going to have a good fucking time. Um, thank you very much for coming by and watching our podcast. Thanks to on it for sponsoring it. Go to o n n I t use the code named Brogan and save yourself 10% off any and all supplements. Also, thanks to death squad.tv though the Brian Red Band Empire and uh, go there and you can buy one of those cool cat tee shirts and you can also find out what podcasts he has and when they're going to be there and what, what shows they have coming up as well. Always great comics, great. A lot of like previously unknown local guys that, uh, Brian, uh, gives a shot, uh, uh, at a big exposure and a really good, really good comics. And tonight after this podcast is over, he has one of my favorite podcasts, uh, on the Internet today. It's a pointless with Kevin Pereira, and that will be a also available only on death squad on iTunes. And who's the guest today?

Speaker 9:          02:32:43       Uh, we got, uh,

Speaker 1:          02:32:46       Mike. Yeah, Mike. Hey, Kevin. Prayers here, Ladies and gentlemen, science bitches. All right. This podcast is over. Go Fuck Yourself. We'll see you soon. We love the shit out of you. I love you more than you love yourself in the multi-verse. Finches.
