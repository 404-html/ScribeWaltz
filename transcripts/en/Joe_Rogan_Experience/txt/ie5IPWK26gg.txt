Speaker 1:          00:00:06       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:00:09       Well good.

Speaker 3:          00:00:18       Yes,

Speaker 2:          00:00:21       we're back. Ladies and gentlemen. Look, Greg Fitzsimmons is right in the letter of Santa Right now plays, it's not too late next year. So always next year. I was thinking about Santa with uh, the elves. Isn't there a funny metaphor that like he's got all these little elves working to make children's toys for no money. And then you think about our toys do come from China. That is kind of fucked up. But Chinese people weren't elves, dude to children. How rude their children are making the toys, little else children. That is kind of fucked up. Yeah. The whole idea of getting a bunch of people to work for

Speaker 1:          00:00:57       way less than they would ever make here is kind of a weird accepted thing that we have as far as like our items, our electronics and the things that we love. Like almost all of them are made by people in another country working for shit money.

Speaker 2:          00:01:13       That's NAFTA, man. We opened it up. So what it is the WTO to trade organization, he has basically, you know, they used to be slavery and with slavery you paid, you paid the help, nothing or very little and a, you had to house them and you had to feed them and you have to heal them. You go to a third world country, it's slavery, but you don't have to deal with any of the overhead

Speaker 1:          00:01:34       Yo. Cause they don't really care if they own you all the time. They just care if they own you enough so that you show up and do what you have to do. Exactly like the, the idea that you're just free to wander around and quit and come back. But if you keep them in economic slavery essentially always going to be in slave.

Speaker 2:          00:01:52       Well that's a mark Saturday that capitalism depends on a, a, a certain percentage of the population being hardcore Unemployable's so that you can always say there's somebody else.

Speaker 1:          00:02:03       Ooh, that's weird. It's weird because I like the idea that people can do whatever they want them to do with their life. They can, they can make whatever choices they would, they would like to make. They could take on whenever, any job they want. But it's, it's strange when you think of someone who's so far ahead of the game, like some Warren Buffet type character, not him. I don't know what kind of business he owns. Sam Walton, some dude, some what's make up some fucking billionaire character. Right. Who decides he can make x amount more per year if they open up a shop and Guatemala and they just close up that one they have here in the states, a little too pricey. This one's going to make us, you know, x amount more on the dollar. Yeah. And probably he will never even know what is it.

Speaker 2:          00:02:48       He will l it's a fucking, it's another zero and it column and in one of his and it, and it crazy thing is, is that, you know, I don't know, I'm not super wealthy, but if I, I would really

Speaker 4:          00:02:59       be thinking about a different agenda than making more, you know, you really feel, look at the people that create, um, you know, an economy within their own country or within their own community and a, at the same time live the life that they deal. Never fucking eat that money up anyway. And look at you. You got your own little in your little economy, you've got a little podcast coming off of yours and you got people that work for you and comedians that you bring on the road and you know, it's, it's everywhere.

Speaker 1:          00:03:29       It's almost like, you know, I hate that expression that Obama used when he was running, when he was in office about small businesses. You didn't do that alone. He didn't do that by herself. Right. But the reality is his point was, was right. And it's, it's right with everything. Like, you can't sell iPhones if no one shows up for work in the factory. Right. If everyone goes, fuck you, you can't pay me 25 cents an hour, fuck you, then we don't have iPhones anymore. Yeah. But because we know that these people were poor, not we were not, we don't have any iPhone factories, but because they know these people are poor, they can continue doing that. Yeah. That's so weird. Man. That's so weird. They're jumping off the building so much. They have nets around them. You look at that, right? He didn't know that. Nah.

Speaker 1:          00:04:15       God, dude, the Foxconn factories are terrifying because those people live there. They have dormitories there, the eat there, live there, asleep there, and they have nets all around them. And this is where it gets really weird. You know, there's always gonna be people who on the hardcore right will always argue towards whatever's like economically best for the company. Yeah. They'll somehow or another come up with some justification for what kind of damage? Tapping an oil well do or oil spills or, or this kind of shit. But this guy said to me, he goes, well, you know, if you look at the numbers, it's actually very similar to the number of people that commit suicide and overall population because you've got to look at it. There's like 500,000 people working at this factory. Yeah. Or some crazy number. I just made that up. We should find out what the actual number is, but it's some nutty number like that. You're talking about thousands of people, olfactory complex. It has a half million people there. I don't think it's a half a million. I made that up, but it might be 50,000 whatever it is. There's so many people that work there that there the amount of people that are, that commit suicide on the job or correctly portion to a normal city. Right. Which is okay, I get it, but how many people killed themselves at work?

Speaker 4:          00:05:30       I was going to go down.

Speaker 1:          00:05:32       Okay.

Speaker 4:          00:05:32       It'd be at my job. I'm taking a couple people with me. I really think suicide is the only reason I would kill, kill myself is that I want it to kill some other people and I don't, I don't want to do the time.

Speaker 1:          00:05:44       God Damn. That's what a lot of people do it when they know the Jig is up. Yup. Let's put that gun in their head. I just that feeling roof.

Speaker 4:          00:05:54       Imagine that moment before you committed suicide. What was what's called high? Your heart rate would be pacing, dealing with your own mortality. The biggest question,

Speaker 5:          00:06:05       and we both know people who've done it right. You know, I know two people that I know. One guy that did it pretty well, I knew him pretty well. He was a really nice time. It was really disturbing. It really hurt. Like you know you, you hear the seven was in such pain, they put a gun to their head. You're like, yeah, I really liked that guy. Like that's fucked. Like I dunno what tipped left or right. It is a chemical makeup or his life's, you know, situation and circumstances, whatever it was. But God damn, that's a, that's a sad, sad thing that the game gets so far gone that Gillette, there's just got to pull the plug. I just going to flip the board over. This is, this is never going to work out

Speaker 4:          00:06:47       because the instinct to not kill yourself is so strong at the pain that would make you do. It must just be something you can imagine.

Speaker 5:          00:06:56       You know, I've talked to quite a few people now with what you would call it, depression or have had depression and overcome it or have had any sort of mental issues and had to take medication for it and overcome it. And I just think we vary so much ma'am. I think human bring our minds and what we could go our norm, what makes us happy, like whatever, whatever your state is that what you need to achieve to get out of like the muck, like the, the, the down feeling, what another person needs to achieve. It could be very different, right? Yeah. You know, it's just like everything else. Like people that are tall, people that are short, freckles, whatever the fuck it is. We vary so much that we gotta be really careful when we like look at like, yeah. Wow. How could he do that? He had such a good life. Like you might've been good life for you on the outside, but that guy was in like some sort of chemical hell all of that,

Speaker 4:          00:07:48       huh? Yeah. With the x theory or maybe doesn't have much to do with the interior. I mean if you talk about the statistics of people committing suicide, I wonder if it's not about the same and the lower class as it is in the upper class.

Speaker 5:          00:08:00       I wonder, you know what I mean? I don't, I don't, I don't know if that's really the factor because I think there's quite a few people, like they said, Mexico is one of the happiest countries on earth and it was also like not a very wealthy country and staff community. Yeah, there's, I think there's, there's a benefit to that that we don't recognize because we're so wrapped up in the idea of community money accumulating dollars that we forget. Like that's only part of wealth. Like the really intelligent wealth is keeping the vibe good as long as possible. Whether it's happiness with friends, happiness with coworkers, happiness with what you do for a living, pride in, in your accomplishments, whatever the fuck it is that it takes to keep feeling included in a group of people. That's huge. That's huge for everybody. People have always wanted to deny that. Everybody wants to be the rugged individualist, but that's too,

Speaker 4:          00:08:53       well, that's our, that's our whole mythology

Speaker 2:          00:08:55       in this country. It's the, you know, the guy riding off alone into the sunset. That's America. That's the cool guy in every movies to go. Doesn't need the chick. Right? You never seen with a buddy. He's got one black buddy and that guy dies in the first act. Somehow or another, he just gets on a horse and it's like, I gotta go. It just gets on that fucking horse. Did you see that commercial? And I would rarely quote a commercial. I think when it's funny, but it's like this chick and she's saying goodbye to a guy and a, it's a hell. It's an insurance commercial and she's in like a big prairie dress with a bonnet and he's the real cowboy and he's putting his hat on and he's like, uh, I got to go off into the sunset and she's pulling it like, no, no. And then he rides off towards the sunset and then he just falls off.

Speaker 2:          00:09:39       It's just so fucking immediate. So funny. Um, yeah, but that's it, man. Being being loners, um, is, it's an important thing. I think as a, as Comedians, obviously that's a solo craft. Podcasting is, you know, a solo craft, but at the same time to feel part of a group and I think like you and I have both gone to the comedy store, uh, it's become part of our lives. Mine for the first time, yours for the second act. And it's like a great feeling to be doing your solo thing, but you're surrounded by other people that have the same background and are following the same path and you know, you really feel very included there.

Speaker 5:          00:10:18       Yeah, it's a really good vibe. It's a, it's a way better vibe. And it was the first time I was there. Yeah, like I really believe is the Internet. I think the Internet has inspired more people to try stand up that were on like maybe the right frequency to be to become a comic. They recognize in their own personality all the shit that we talk about that's wrong with us. They're like, oh, maybe I'm just a comic. Like maybe like I might be able to do that. I make people laugh at work. I might literally be able to do that. I think more people were inspired by that. And then also when you hear a bunch of comics doing these podcasts, talking about comedy like as an art form and what's involved in it and you kind of get a sense like this guy described it to me and he became an open miker and now he's actually have a working comic.

Speaker 5:          00:11:01       You started out doing it from hearing us talk about it on the podcast, but doing comedy like I think he said like two and a half years now, but he said it's like taking a master's class in comedy. He listened to the bill burr and talk about how he writes jokes it listening to Greg Fitzsimmons talk about the differences treatment, his act now and his act then where the errors are. He'd get Joey Diaz talking about like how we learned to let go and how he had fear when he was on and always worried about people accepting them and one day he was like, fuck you. And I remember that turnaround for Joey. This is radical turnaround. When he was always really funny offstage, we had a hard time being funny on stage and then it was like, like 99 somewhere around that 98 99 boom. He figured it out. Yeah, just like out of nowhere. Right. He went quicker than I've ever seen anybody go from having a hard time on stage to destroy. Yeah. Like I remember he gained a lot of weight coincidentally at that same time. That was how

Speaker 6:          00:11:54       didn't give a fuck he got, yeah. That's when he went from like 210 pounds to like Mike over 300 pounds, like in a year. But God damn was he funny. Yeah, he, I've seen it happen with guys and uh, you know, like Jim Norton, man, he haunted the, the comedy cellar and those clubs for a decade, you know, 12 years something before he got any real traction. And then when he, when he found his voice, I mean the guy's, he's just fucking great. He's phenomenal. He's a really good comic man. I saw him in Austin and it was a good thing for me to see because I was doing sets that maybe we like too long. Yeah. And he did like 55, 50, 55 minutes and just murdered. And I'm like, that's a good amount of time because you don't get tired of a guy, you know, like, I know when people are tired of hearing me talking, you're going, but you always feel like there's this borderline between wanting to give them their money's worth and just like, even a great movie sucks after three and a half hours, you know, or whatever it is for comedy, an hour and 10 minutes or whatever the number is.

Speaker 6:          00:12:52       Yeah. But seeing him, uh, in Austin was great because I hadn't gone to like a show, like sit down and watch a show in a while. It always been like, I'm at a set, oh who's on, you know, oh Bubba buzz on, Oh let's go peek in real quick. But to sit down and watch the whole show, his whole set was really fun. Yeah, it's really fun. It is weird to sit down. Like I just was in Vegas with some friends and Steven Wright was playing, sadly. I said, fuck man, we was it. It was great. He was great. Dan, you know, he was doing a lot of new shit and just, you know, everyone was high of course, and it was just this perfect match. And then he hung out with us after the shelf for a while. I told him, my friend, my friend got so baked, he fell asleep during the shell and Steven came out and he goes, how'd you guys like the show? And I called my friend Dan fell asleep and stay right. Could not stop laughing. And he's like, cause he's, he's been on my podcast and he's just like, I in all the years I've done this, I've never had anybody like throw somebody under the bus like that.

Speaker 6:          00:13:54       And he just kept talking about it for like 15 minutes. I had some funny thing look about what people don't want to admit. They were asleep. All right. All right. You know I fell asleep during your show. If you fall asleep, you been up for 72 hours. It's the first time he sat still in 72 hours and Steven right. If you're going to like that, that's a, that's not like a Kevin Hart, like lack of explosion. Yeah. Steven Wright is the guy. Yeah. You know like I used to work in a fire, hard drink factory. Couldn't park anywhere near the place.

Speaker 6:          00:14:29       He was like the first Twitter, you know, his comedy was Twitter call like easily. He would have been a monster on Twitter if he put just those jokes on Twitter. Yeah. But then they would, you know, you would ruin the bits. Yeah. Maybe he should go back and just take all the Shitty, never put out and just start tweeting it because you know, that guy doesn't tweet. You probably doesn't give a shit. Well, didn't he write it? He was tweeting a whole book. Oh really? Yeah. He was doing this weird thing where he was tweeting a whole book, 140 characters at a time. That's really cool. I love that. Yeah. I, yeah, I think you would write like a new hundred and 40 characters every day. Oh, he, oh. He wasn't just like he wrote it and he was releasing it. He was actually, I don't think so.

Speaker 6:          00:15:12       I think he was doing it like, how was he doing it? How many tweets a day was he doing? It probably had a limited number of tweets who's doing every day. Yeah. Explains it on Conan. He explains it on Conan. We can't play that though. Would get in trouble. Yeah. But whatever it is, uh, he tweeted a book. He said, fucking Weirdo. That's amazing. He's the guy, man that changed Boston comedy. That was the one guy that changed the whole scene. It, at least if you listen to a, like the guys that grew up during that time and that France Alameda documentary when standup stood out. So great documentary. It's really cool cause it was like the generation right before we started, you had to really let us know that like how lucky we are. We got like you and I've talked about this before, but we came along at the perfect time like ever in the history of comics.

Speaker 6:          00:16:02       That made me now, now it's pretty God damn good time. Yeah. There's not a lot less money that me and you are making money right out of the gate. Hey, we got a car. He got his 50 bucks kit. There was so many satellite rooms. Yeah we could, we were living in Boston and we could go in any direction. There was probably two or 300 rooms. Yeah, right between Boston comedy between Sherry Hirsch, between um, pill. He downs. Paul Barkley. They all had like Boston comedy. Barry Katz, his organization had married 50 rooms problems. They had so many rooms. So there's, I mean, may maybe exaggerating saying hundreds, but it was more than a hundred rooms all around this area. And so we could just go to a different place all the time. They always needed comics. And if you were, if you were a good comic and you were reliable, and again, if you had a car and you would pick up the headliner, you would literally call a guy like Mike Clark and he would fill seven weekends on the spot in one phone call and then you'd call a Barry Katz and he'd fell seven weekends.

Speaker 6:          00:17:06       And like, you know, in, in, you know, a week, you talked to five agents and your year is booked six nights a week. And then all you got to do is play softball, go to the movies and drive to the Gig at night. That's a lot of guys fall into that. Mike Clark had some of the craziest fucking gigs. Dude, I did a restaurant for him once. I was the one opening week and it never happened again after me. It was, it was one of the clubs. It opened and closed it, uh, because I told them how it was set up and he agreed that they couldn't do a show there. I was like, you just literally can't do a show there because you do standup at a lounge. First of all, nobody told these people there's going to be stand up. So they're sitting there waiting to get seated. It was the biggest seafood and like

Speaker 5:          00:17:50       this part of the Cape. So there would be, you know, this giant fucking like room where people are seeding, waiting for them to call their seat and they're now no shit. So when they're calling their seat and their name or their, uh, their name and their, you know, Johnson party of six, they're doing it on the same microphone as you. So you're on stage, you're on stage. I'm onstage. And uh, it became a joke after a while. I'm like, this is like truly hilarious cause you'd be right up and I'm telling her Johnson party has six, your table's ready. Johnson party of six. You're table's ready. Johnson Johnson Party of [inaudible]. And you're like, oh my God. I mean, I'm not joking man, because they're not even in the same room as you. So they have no fucking idea. No, no, no. It's a big place. So like you're in this giant lounge area with these families there. You're talking about blow jobs and these families are like, what the fuck is going on? And then it's surreal. It's surreal. And in the middle of your act, just right in the middle, out of nowhere, there's six birds and Johnson party of six. Your table's ready. It was the worst. It was one of the, it wasn't, it wasn't the worst cause the people were friends.

Speaker 6:          00:19:07       Lee, you know the magic. Just go back to that same place now and you know, it's the same restaurant with the same PA system, the whole thing. Bring cameras and film your one hour special with, with them. Come project.

Speaker 5:          00:19:22       Try to work around this. Work

Speaker 6:          00:19:24       the Johnsons, they're heading into the family. Hey, nice jacket. Well you know what, if people knew you were filming though, they would come up with stupid names and it's just so solar. You yell out their name. Take my current party of six. You're table's ready, Mike Hunt. They would probably hate that kind of comedy out there. Even no matter how famous you got, there's like a really conservative part of the yeah, yeah. The Cape is very family. It's very Norman Rockwell tight. Yeah. Right. And they leave the Cape. And my friend dated this girl from the Cape, but she, she became a, a whore and a crack head. He, she was as sweet, like preppy girl from the Cape, came from money, moved to Venice beach and all of a sudden she was getting skinny and they'll send, she had a herpes virus on her lip and he got it from her and then, and then, and then he found, I think he found an ad, like she had the newspaper with the classified section where she had put an ad is back before the Internet for herself and she was selling herself, selling herself. And then she came by and so they broke up and she came by like a year later with another dude. She weighed like 90 pounds. Wow. Having the Cape on the Cape, man. Well, there's a lot of sheltered people up in that neck of the woods. It's beautiful though. Oh, it's great. It's so nice. In the summer, especially in the, there's something about

Speaker 1:          00:20:48       it. It's just so gray and the water is so unforgiving. You know? It's the something Cooley, but even being cold walking around the beach and the winter was always weird for me. I enjoy it. You look at the trees and with no leaves on them and they just look strong. Everything is strong because it's just getting battered by wind and cold and it also like, it gives you this sense of cycle that I think we miss out on a bit of here. I think the cycle, the seasons is much more normal than no seasons and what we're doing is we're all sort of adapting our, our like perceptions of nature on this really unrealistic spot. Yeah. You know, as power and fucking never rains stalled out. I mean it gets kind of hot for a while, but just go near the water. You'll be fine now.

Speaker 1:          00:21:34       You need it. You need the cycle that's in my house. We celebrate my wife's menstrual flow change clothes like fall, we'll go fall and then fall colors. He had fall colors on her timber on her September dripping. Did you see that? Um, I don't know if this is bullshit or not. Somebody said to me on Twitter and I looked at, it was about to get in my car. I was like, what? It was something about women that don't want to be forced to wear maxi pads or tampons. I think it's bullshit. So they're just going natural. They're just doing natural flow. Like the literally in your face about their period blood dripping out of their underwear. They don't give a fuck. They just wear it like fluffy socks. I think they just let it drip down their leg. I mean, it might be bullshit. I might be getting trolled right now because I just looked at it like, really briefly take a look at it.

Speaker 1:          00:22:24       They're young, Jamie, and you tell me with your discerning eye, I could see that because the tampon that that's the way you stick inside, right? The tampon. Yes. Gregory. I didn't get confused. Um, the tampon causes toxic shock syndrome. It can if you leave it in, right? Is that what happens? I don't know. I didn't even know it was help catalyze the movement. Oh my God. This is real benefits of sustainable menstrual options. What does this sustainable, I'm really tired of people using that word. I think the people that use the word sustainable and the people that use the word handcrafted should get together and go fuck themselves. I'm tired of both of those terms. All natural. You're sustainable. What are you taught? What human beings devour the planet? Stop with your sustainable. Yeah. Oh, this is better. It's better for the environment. One dump truck of waste per person versus a few desing reusable pads.

Speaker 1:          00:23:16       Reduce pollution. They're reusable pads. Hold on a second. BARF. Could you imagine you're, you're cooter is blowing into this fucking wad of cotton every, every month. You're scrubbing out the bacteria in the blood. It's all intertwined and all the fibers of your coach area of your underwear. Man, get the fuck Outta here with this. Listen we live in 2015 if we, you still use paper to write down on you, we can afford a little cot in the plug your clam with. Okay, I'll kick in a few bucks for that. I'm on board. I mean they, yeah, there's a few things that we'll look at that picture. Hold on a second. Pull that picture. Becca, what did it say? The Stat, oh my God. I just, it says disposable Tampon Pad user produces a dump truck of menstrual wastes in their lifetime and it's showing you this giant fucking dump truck, which probably doesn't have only tampons in it but

Speaker 2:          00:24:12       that would be great is if every time you throw out a Tampon you had to throw it in your truck. Every woman gets one truck and once it's filled

Speaker 1:          00:24:20       kill you. Yeah. You have like a year lead dump of your, your tampons. Like for a year they have to stay in your backyard in a big pink barrel. Just dogs barking from all over the neighborhood. Yeah. You know how you have like trash? It's like one color of the recyclables, like Brown, like lawn, lawn trim is good stuff is bro. Yeah, everybody has different, it would be like once a year they pick up your soiled menstrual plugs. That's a weird thing with guys being scared of menstrual blood. I've never really understood that. It doesn't bother me at all. I mean, not a little, not even a little bit. I don't get it. It doesn't bind. I mean some do. It's freak though. I had a friend and he would fucking be like, I'm never buying a chick on her period. Get outta here. I'm like, so your girlfriend really wants to have sex. She's on her period. You wanna have sex story. He's like, fuck that and I want you to own that shit. I think it seems

Speaker 2:          00:25:10       better. Woo. Greg is dirty. Like we were. Well dirty boy. We were down to Florida one time, me and a, you know, Mike Gibbons, my buddy Mike and this other guy, the guy whose girlfriend became a hooker's, matter of fact, and it was a, uh, there was a water slide park and it was, it was locked. And we got through the chain link fence and we went in and my buddy turned the water on. It was like a real rudimentary roadside waterpark and we started going down the slide in the middle of the night. It's like fucking, you know, midnight and a, I remember thinking like, I would not have had that much fun during the day. And I think that's what menstrual sex is like, you're not supposed to be in there. So it's like a, it's a special treat.

Speaker 1:          00:25:50       That's a special treat, but a lot of girls are horny or when they're on, they're pretty, oh yeah. Oh yeah, that's right. Would you push back? Let me ask you this in all sincerity, because I've debated this myself, would you, um, if they one day figure out a way to manipulate human bodies in, in such an incredible way that they can actually turn you into a woman, like turn you back into a woman back into Greg again. Like would you try to, would you be a woman for a Doris? Yes. For a whole day or how long had you held on just do it for a week. Would you take the d?

Speaker 2:          00:26:27       No. No. I would do the woman that I would definitely masturbate. Relentless Lake. You'd stick something and I would go to some spas. I'd go to a lot of spas are women are walking around, okay, what about

Speaker 1:          00:26:37       this? How about this? What if here's, we went, we're going deep. What if you, they figured

Speaker 6:          00:26:44       out a way to manipulate genetics to the point where you could become your wife and your wife could become you, like literally become you and then fuck you. Would you agree to that?

Speaker 3:          00:26:53       Okay.

Speaker 6:          00:26:53       And No. No Way. You wouldn't let your wife be you and you'll be your wife just for a day now. No. Why not? Cause I could never look at it the same way again. But it's her. I don't want to be inside there. But there's so many seat, little, little secrets that women have and there's things you wonder about their soul and what they're really thinking when you're talking and all those little subtle things. I don't, I don't want that. Uh hmm. I see your point. I want to know that. That's beautiful. You're a man of like, you love romance mystery. Yeah. That's beautiful. I love my wife. I'm not even talking about your wife. I think in everything in life. Yeah.

Speaker 6:          00:27:34       50 shades of gray. There was in the book, there was a Tampon sex scene and they took it out in the movie. How dare they, the movie made a trillion dollars movie cure the deficits. Right. I know. It's fucking crazy. Why do you think it, did you think you think guys went, like, did, did women dragged our men to it? Or is that just women going? Mostly women, I think probably. Right. And, uh, psychologically if I had to analyze with all due respect, and this is again just my opinion, I think the reason why those like savage type sexual scenarios like savage, lustful, crazy things, they'll ball gags and spitting in your mouth and you know, look a lot of the crazy shit that seems to excite people unexpectedly. You know when you talk about like the average American woman and then you talk about them.

Speaker 6:          00:28:21       I don't know exactly what 50 shades of grey hairs, I'm just talking out of my ass, but I ran was a lot of like time you read the whole thing. Well I was hired to do a parody of it. Oh, so I read it will tell me because I would assume that it's like a lot of like choking and abuse really light. It's light. Like the funny thing is is there's no, I described it as if you had a seven year old and you showed them nothing but porn and then you said write a story.

Speaker 6:          00:28:48       It's so inane. There's no fucking story. It's just a, it's an excuse for a rich guy to completely humiliate a college girl. And when get off on it because he's so beautiful and wealthy and, but there's no, nothing happened. I mean, I don't want to ruin the ending. I don't fuck it up. Spoiler alert. Literally nothing happens in the, everybody knows already. I don't think they care. It's just, it's just the same kind of shit you'd see at Cinemax. I think there is a, a lot of women, I think there are a lot of women that don't feel sexually attractive. They don't like, they don't feel like anyone ever feels like that with them like anyone has ever overcome with lug desire to be with them. They look at themselves as like, God, I wish that was happening to me. And they developed this like intense need for romance. It's like the classic story of Romance Novel Readers.

Speaker 5:          00:29:42       Like what do they look like? It's usually like an overweight woman. Like that's what a lot of people think about when they think of someone who reads romance novels. What comes to mind? Not necessarily true, but the idea being that like for a lot of people like that is so attractive. This, this, you know, this crazy, maniacal, passionate, little, even disgusting, an abusive situation between a guy and a girl. Cause there's so much lust there is like lust and depravity and they're missing that. They're not getting, you know, they're not getting anybody that wants to be with them and touch them. That's like a fundamental need that people have that we kind of ignore a lot when we're looking at like social trends and the way people behave, like the fun, there's a fundamental need that we have to touch each other. Like it's 100% necessary. Like if you, if you take people and you give them no contact with other people, they literally go bananas. We need to be around each other.

Speaker 4:          00:30:38       I was hugged sad people. Oh. Like if I meet somebody and they just seem really sad, I not right then and there, but the next time I see them I'll throw a hug on him. And it's amazing to see the change. They fucking like you so much.

Speaker 5:          00:30:50       Yeah, man, I've told the story, but just in the nature of, uh, this, uh, discussion, I got it. The first job that I ever did in Hollywood. That's stupid hardball show. I had the situation where I came out here to not have any friends and uh, I was out here filming it for like two weeks and uh, didn't have a girlfriend in La. I didn't know anybody. So I just go to the comedy store and go home and we have this scene that we were doing with me and this girl and she gave me a hug and she didn't even give me a hug, like a sexual hug. It wasn't like I was a track, I mean she was a very attractive, but it wasn't like that. She was like, aw, she came over, give me a hug. And my whole body just tangled, like not sexually because he'd been in love.

Speaker 5:          00:31:38       Like I felt love and like I felt like a warm hug from a, like God damn. And I realized right there immediately I was like, I need this in my life. If this is something like if you don't have your, you feel dull, you life feels dulled down. Yeah. And unfortunately, whether it's because of genetics, because a diet or because of fucking fill in the blank where some people just aren't that attractive to other people and then that's not a politically correct thing to say, but that's exactly what it is. And so they're super excited about someone being excited about them.

Speaker 4:          00:32:10       There's an app where you can hug people where people meet, they meet out in a public place and they have here look it up. They meet in a public place and they just come. They say hello, they hug and then they walk away. Oh my God. And it's worldwide. That's insane. That is so insane. And I heard the guy getting interviewed and they were like, well, it does it sometimes. Like then lead to Saks like you would naturally think. He's like now most people just, they just wanted a hug. That's why they went on the APP. That's all they wanted. Wow.

Speaker 1:          00:32:40       Yeah. That's going to end badly. Well, my son, yeah. Oh yeah. Yeah, that'll cuddle. Curious. Free App makes it easy to score. Hugs, cuddler. Aw, that's cute. And that hilarious. Hugging People's Nice. It's just the problem is there's a lot of like overly needy people out there. A lot of crazy people out there. A lot of them mean people out there, a lot of insult people that will insult you just to get a rise out of you. And that's just the world. And girls have to deal that way more than we do. Like it's the worst thing in the world when you see a guy hit on a girl and then the girl refutes him and you know, fuck you bitch, you know I didn't like you. And you're like, that is disgusting. That's like, you realize like guys like that are the reason why chicks her fucking weirded out by dudes. Yeah. You know, someone who hits on you and then when you say no, they get angry at you, they all of a sudden like from, I want to fuck you too. I want to hit you. You know? And that's something fortunately we don't have to deal with.

Speaker 2:          00:33:41       Yeah. It's uh, I mean, he can see it. It's an insecurity. Obviously the guy, the guy got hurt and so he lashed out with anger.

Speaker 1:          00:33:48       It could be that for sure. I mean it certainly, I think there's a lot of factors. I think that's, that's a big part of it though. Definitely. I think the other part of it is that like, I think for a lot of men it's like very frustrating to try to figure out how to get someone to choose you over, you know, x guys, x number of competition. Yeah. I mean you're losing, yeah. I mean that's the reason why men dressed the way they dress. I mean, a big part of it for them is like to try to look good. You know, like guys who were the right watch are guys who have the right shoes or guys who were like a really slick jacket. Like you're doing it to look good. You're doing, I mean, that's why you're doing it. You're doing it to be more attractive. You know, whether you're doing it for yourself or you're doing it for your business images ultimately for yourself, you're trying to be more attractive

Speaker 2:          00:34:38       and no matter how attractive you are, you're trying to be more attractive because you're trying to, you know, it's nature. You're trying to attract the best mate that you can get.

Speaker 1:          00:34:48       It's crazy. The guys will, some guys will go like all out liquid diamonds and shit and to like giant watches would crossed it and diamonds and they know like, look, I am only going to attract dumb hose. Yeah, that's it. That's what I'm shooting for. Right. You know, and they'll like walk around with like giant golden crusted or diamond encrusted necklaces and shit off.

Speaker 2:          00:35:15       Yeah. They could pull it off way better than we can. Um, you know her at certain cars, you see a guy pull up in a certain car and for some guys that makes sense. You're like, yeah, that guy belongs in a Porsche and they see another guy and you're like, you're,

Speaker 1:          00:35:27       am I going to say you're not supposed to be in a Porsche? Anybody who really likes a should be in a Porsche, but Porsche, no, but want to be, no, you shouldn't be in a Porsche. Right. You should be in a Porsche. That's a Porsche, is it? Yeah. That's what you're supposed to say. Porsche. Yeah. There's still a lot of people that are like car journalists like Chris Harris who calls it Polsh is a Porsche though. Is it Jaguar? Jaguar? It depends on what country and this is American mother. Fuck American Jaguar. Good American. Now you minium Jag. You are Jag. Yeah. That sounds like you're cursing somebody out. Jag. You all y'all. You Jaguar Fit Simmons? Yeah, I gotta. I gotta get that fucking Mustang. I saw one yesterday. New Ones. And they wait for the new ones. Yeah, they're coming out 50th year anniversary. This is what you want.

Speaker 1:          00:36:24       You want the GT three 50 don't fuck around. Do not pass. Go the Shelby gt. Three 50 coming. It'll be coming out very soon. Gregory. How much? I don't know how much. Stop with the money. You're going to live forever. Stop. You make good money. This is what you need to do. You need to get 500 American naturally aspirated horsepower under your balls. Yeah, dude, it's doing Newburg ring times like low, low numbers, man. They look like spectacular results with this car. It's like got independent suspension for the first time in a long time. For mustangs. Like they had it for awhile and then they went back to the live rear axle. I guess I don't know enough about that, but this new suspension is supposed to be incredible. This car cars coming out soon, son, don't fuck around or get one of those. Challenger hellcats.

Speaker 1:          00:37:11       I drove one of those in Denver. Has the visibility out the back of that good enough? No, it doesn't matter. Nothing's coming up behind you. Look, get that fucking car. Oh 16 Shelby gt three 15 I like the back. Good Lord. That mixed my fast back to fucking American car son. That's, that's real American muscle, but like super sophisticated. Now they're making these cars like this car where they're American muscle meaning like stupid high horsepower. V Eight awesome sound rumble. But they handle that car fucking handles man. That's how much money do they spend making that roar sound right? You know, they got all kinds of acoustics experts and on that Muffler we'll, you know, accident. They probably do. I think so. Especially the Shelby has that awesome deep throaty like bubbling up in the morning. Yeah, they sound so good. V Eight sounds always the best. Like you can have a beautiful VC like Porsche's are sixes flat six. They sound really good too. But that sounds the best. That American v eight rumble. It's just so fucking ball draining. That's uh, something about that engine sound for whatever reason actually stimulates testosterone in men. There's been studies dial. I'm sure that's insane. Absolutely. The sound of an engine, it's like a lion roaring. You probably hear that and

Speaker 1:          00:38:35       you gotta grow some. You've got to grow some balls fast. Yeah man. If you had lions all around your bedroom, I bet you'd have so much testosterone. Imagine if you slept in like you had this like super thick wire cage, like really fucking fic where lines definitely can't get through it. No Way. And that's your walls and your, the rest of your house, like all on the outside, there's an outside wall way, way out there. But most of it is a lion sanctuary. Yeah. So where you live is like the outside is like a house, but the inside, like where it faces the line sanctuary is all wire mesh and it's all around your bed. So it's like your walls are insulated with lions and you walk out there and then you sleep. You walk out there like a long path through this thick wire mesh and you sleep in the middle of the line sanctuary. And periodically throughout the day they release animals for the lines to chase and kill in front of you.

Speaker 1:          00:39:38       You're brushing your teeth and you see some poor giraffe stumble out, look left, look right, and you see them run towards it and take it down like fucking Christ. You hear ball and snap and one of them's got the neck and the things flop around. I was trying to kick in a town, its guts apart and you're 20 feet away and your chest is rumbling noise. Allow raw. You can barely hear it over your electric toothbrush. Yeah. Oh, ripping apart some giraffe right in front of you. Fun splatters on your face, fighting each other over chunks of meat swab. The new male comes into town, there's a fucking bra and, and you're just getting manly. You're either shrinking from it and becoming a complete pussy or you're growing hair on your chest and you're going, you would look like in Armenian bodybuilder. That's what you look like. Just hey, Harry thing. He'd get angry. You're not even working out. You've never lifted a weight and your ribs. Your body's just prepared for death every second of every day.

Speaker 1:          00:40:49       You just hear that roar in the middle of the night. Plus you're inhaling on that. Fair owns that. They spray it up the whole time. They probably piss on your fucking cage. They'll probably spray your cage. You probably going to have to call in the maid and shows the Lion Piss. All of those things up. The Fairmont's. I just want to take a nap. I'm, you know what? I'm not getting pissed on tonight. I'm putting up the shades. I'm just, you know what? I'm not avoiding the lions. I just don't want to pee in them. I can handle the lions. I just don't want to Piss it on my head while I'm sleeping. It's it. Yeah, they will. They will piss on things. Right, like a regular cat does. Well, especially after they fight and they spray the area cause they just one, it's fucking weird to watch man was like what does that even coming from? Yeah,

Speaker 5:          00:41:34       you got an extra hole back there. Like what is that? How's that work? Cause they spray out the back like out of their ass. He has some kind of little gland back there. How bizarre. Yeah. Like they have almost like an extra dick, like a d, an extra like a blow hole and their deck. Well it's, I guess it's like pre semen, right? I don't know where it comes from. I'd never thought about, I had a cat that used to spray to really? Oh Man. I had a feral cat and at one point in time, um, I had a great veterinarian. Luckily Dr. Craig, unfortunately he died, drunk driver hit her man fucking, he was the nicest guy. He was hilarious. Like a really funny guy. Loved, loved, loved animals. Anyway, I had this feral cat and when it was time, like most of the time I could pet him, but there was occasionally times we tried to pick him up.

Speaker 5:          00:42:21       He'll fight you to the death, just fucking freak out and run away. And I had to get him to the vet because it was time to get them fixed. He's just pissing in my fucking house. Seems like we'd pick up his back. They like, is it the pickup is back like his ass and his tail and he would just see it come out. You're like you little motherfucker. And when I trapped him in the bathroom, he was just spraying everywhere. Dude, just spraying. But I never looked at where it came from because that was in mortal danger. Like I was trying to figure out how to get this little guy in a basket. What I did was I threw a blanket over him. I wrapped him up in the blanket and then I stuffed the blanket inside of a laundry basket and then I carried him out.

Speaker 5:          00:43:01       I carried him to the vet in a fucking laundry basket place. He's like going crazy like that. He was going bananas. He was going bananas. He's trying to kill me. He was trying to kill me, but he was my buddy. It was the weirdest thing and no one else could even touch this cat. If you came out with my head, he might house, he would run from you, but he would sit in my lap. I could pet them up, I can pick them up and once I started petting him, he would perse so loud. But it was like the person like never got touched. Like once, like he, it was the weirdest thing. He would go from work. I'm scared of everything. You pick them up dude. It's all right. It's all right.

Speaker 5:          00:43:36       Like a and really loud per like the poor guy, his whatever months of his life where he was wild before I got ahold of them. She has fucked his head up. Like trying to maintain in your home. A feral cat is a very unique situation. Taught me a lot. Did it, did the behavior change after he got neutered? He never did. Behavior never changed. No. I mean it, he was always cool only with me. That's it. No other people. That's it. He liked my cats. My cats and him were very close and he would hang out with them. Everybody was groovy, but there was no other person who was allowed to pick them up. He just wouldn't have it and he wouldn't have it sometimes for me, like he do. He knew me from the time he was a little baby and I had them for at least seven or eight years.

Speaker 5:          00:44:22       How did you find him? My friend found him. Yeah. Her and her boyfriend were living in this apartment and underneath it there was like a cat that had given birth to a bunch of kittens. And so like she kind of freaked out like, oh my God, these poor little things. They're wild and they're hissing and people. So they set traps for them because they were like, you know, they were, well they would go out to their car and there's like this litter of Kittens, like living under your house. Like it was really depressing time. Yeah. So her and her boyfriend decided to trap him. Trap the cats and you know, they were a little demons man, just fucking spotter in. And then you realize like, man, once you, if you're that fucked up from like that, like first couple months, like your view of the world is that dangerous. I mean, you literally a wild industry, no one's petting you. You know, you're not getting little can of tuna in front of you. Oh, do you like it? No, it's full on instinct. You're eating bugs, reading anything that moves yes.

Speaker 2:          00:45:16       Fighting other cats to get to the,

Speaker 5:          00:45:18       yeah. And you know, your parents are trying to bring you back food. You're barely staying alive. And so he goes from that to all of a sudden he's hanging out with me in my house and he's eating cat food. You know, it was get cat food every day. You can't believe the food's still here every day. You know, it was really weird to see will he overeat if you leave out food? He's dead now. But, uh, he uh, didn't overeat. No, he, he, no, he normalized to the point where like walking around the house, he didn't look like it was constantly in terror, but if you got too close to him, he would be like, what the fuck are you planning? You know, it's like, it was when he was by himself, he was fine. Like he was cool. It was just chill out and who you catch them like signing himself by the window. Everything was groovy. It's on people's got too close to him. You just wasn't, oh, would never was. Totally. Sure. Yeah. No, it was totally sure.

Speaker 2:          00:46:06       Here, reminded me of when you talked about grabbing them in the laundry basket. Do you remember back in Boston? You were out one night with Jennifer and I was home and I swear to God on my father's grave, this happened. I rented Batman Blockbuster. Uh, and I put it in and I'm sitting at home and I'm watching it. And then, uh, all of a sudden I see this shadow and then I turned my head and I see another shadow and I look up and there's a bat flying around the apartment. And I'm like, what? And I'm scared shitless of bats. Like it's like my thing. And it's like ever since I was a kid, my aunt had this bar near her and they had bats and they would be telling me they were fruit bats. And if they bite you, you'll get rabies and you'll die.

Speaker 2:          00:46:50       And, and so, and we would always be outside playing tag at night and I would fucking, bats would fly by and I'd freak out. And, and so I'm alone in the apartment and there's a bat flying around and Batman is on TV. And so, uh, all I knew is they go in your hair, which I think is like not even true. So I put on a baseball cap backwards and I had on sunglasses and a tennis racket suck. Glad in one going in my eyes, he's going to go from that. So, and I'm running around the apartment swinging at him. He's taken off, he's like, you know, he's just, they're erratic, the way they fly. You don't know where they're fucking going. And this goes on for like 10 minutes. And then there's like a standoff on a waiting and then I hear you coming up the stairs and you came in and you opened the door and you go, what the fuck are you doing?

Speaker 2:          00:47:37       And I got this a bad in here. And you just, you just grabbed the tennis racket out of my hand. And he walked up and he was in the window and you just bashed him once and he just went down and then you just walked over and you had take out in your hand and you just went into the kitchen and started eating it. I'm standing there with sunglasses and I, Ana, I remember that. That's hilarious. That's hilarious. I probably wouldn't even killed it if you weren't already trying to kill it. I think you, you might, I call the animal people to come get it

Speaker 1:          00:48:06       because it looked like it was stunned. Ooh. He was actually dead sick. Oh, you mean once I hit it? Yeah, no, it was done right. Yeah, I remember I killed it. Yeah, I remember. I'm like, I'm not going to have this thing software. Yeah. I don't remember what I did, but I remember it was some hitting involved. I'm pretty sure it was the tennis racket could have been. Yeah. I mean you were fearless. I was like, fuck man. I don't like, I don't like baths, but I do know that on very rare, very rare occasions, bats I've rabies. Yeah, it's very, very rare. So like same thing with like squirrels. Very rare they have rabies, but I'm not taking any fucking chances. I'm not getting rabies. Dude, get rabies. You have some crazy shot they put through your stomach and he can call in retrospect. Probably could have tried to save the thing. Throw, throw. But it might've been sick too.

Speaker 2:          00:48:55       Yeah, I didn't want to loan him. There was a lot of bats.

Speaker 1:          00:48:58       Neighborhood in Brookline. The other were raccoons too. Right? Remember lot of raccoons. Yeah. Here in la, you get rats. They're everywhere. The Hollywood hills, apparently it's especially bad. Yeah, they're filled with a Mo. There probably isn't as many birds. You know, you don't see hawks flying around that much. You should see a lot more hawks that, and they're, they're not around, so they're not killing the, uh, the Vermont. Well, it's also unfortunately coyotes too. And people hate coyotes. And I, you know, I'm not a fan because they will kill your dog right in front of you. And they would bite children if they could get away with it. Oh yeah. There's been many instance. I mean they don't have like rules, they're just, they're opportunists. And if you have a three year old and it's wandering around naked, a coyote lead it, it's just mean it's a fucked up thing to say because most people don't leave the three year olds alone.

Speaker 1:          00:49:41       But you know, coyotes are creepy, but they do keep rat populations down and they'd learn. There is a balance that has to be, unless we're going to kill all the rats to like, we were just going to be the executioners and fucking natural world. Like when it doesn't work like that. So when you force coyotes out of neighborhoods, which I agree with, it's a, it's a two edge sword. Yeah. Cause I don't want coyotes killing my friend's dog. Yeah. That's a sad thing. There's a, one of the guys that, I think it was one of the guys that worked on fear factor, I forget who it was in his neighborhood. This lady was walking her dog in Brentwood in this fucking coyote came running up behind her. She said she just heard click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click. And she didn't even know what it was and it just snatched her fuck a dog right off the leash and ran with it.

Speaker 1:          00:50:22       Yeah. Just crammed it right in front of her. She screamed, she let go of the leash. Coyote ran off with their dog. Wow. Killed it right in front of her. Brazen. That's brutal. Yeah. So I would rather have rat traps out then those little fucking conti dog's eaten monsters. Yeah, they'll eat dogs, man. I mean that's, that is shit. You're on the Diet because I guess our coyotes related to wolves. Are they? They're, they're dogs. They're all dogs. Right? So everything comes from wolves because you gotta think if you can, if you come from a wealth and you're now coyote, you're, you're pretty bad ass. And then you see an Americanized, like a small dog. They are not very tough. Yeah. You probably don't even see it as the same species as you. That's just an easy soft lunch. Well, it's fucked as the coyotes are actually so clever that they will get dogs to think that they're their friends.

Speaker 1:          00:51:14       Like they come around and hang out with them the right outside the fence. Yeah. Like my neighbor has this little dog, he has a Beagle and he says the coyote comes out and the dog starts wagging its tail. Like, look, my friend is here. But meanwhile they're Kyle. He'll eat that beagle to beagle thinks everybody's like him. You know, at four o'clock in the afternoon the food gets put into a bowl and his tail wags and he waddles his little fucking Chubby Body over to the bowl and he eats. And meanwhile outside, it's just things ribs are showing and it's gets big long face. Just design for snatch and shit up and it's like, ah man, come on outside and play. Hey, I'm your friend, Mr Bagel. I like you. Come on man. Did my dad look at my tail? Look, the door's open, man. What?

Speaker 1:          00:51:57       The door's open. Should I come? Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. Come on. Just who's your nose, you should know is open to talk. Come on. Just grab them. There's fucking run with them. Poured bigos wasn't playing golf recently in this, uh, coyote. We just came out on the course. Just looked at us. Didn't, wasn't scared at all. You know, they're, they're slippery because, you know, I'm not saying I hate them. I think there's something beautiful about their existence. I don't want to do it, but there's something beautiful about this. This animal that lives like just adjacent to civilization, intertwined slightly, occasionally dips into their world and steals a cat. You know, last ones to leave the party. You see, they've got one of my chickens. I watched it watch a jump over the fence with my chicken. Yeah, yeah. Recently it was, it jumped over this like I had a fountain and it jumped onto the fountain and then right over the fence I got the fountain right up, like one of those little portable fountains with the chicken in his mouth.

Speaker 1:          00:52:57       And just boom, just right over ice mail down about 10 times before I had a chicken in one of the, not in the regular pen, but in another box. And it was a, when chickens brood, you have to a, you have to take them away from the rest of the chickens. You gotta take him out of their box, you're going to force him to sit on a perch for like usually a day or two and then they calm down. They get out of it. But if you don't, they'll start picking their feathers off. And what it is is like females in the natural world of chickens,

Speaker 5:          00:53:26       they want to fuck a rooster and they want the egg that they give. You know, they've make an egg almost every day, but most of the time those eggs are unfertilized. So the exit we eat are unfertilized eggs. I didn't even fucking know this. I was in my forties I thought that all eggs could be chunked chickens if you'd just laid on them, which is really retarded. I, I had no idea that chickens just lay an egg every day. Whether or not they're pregnant or not. I just, how do they know which ones to sit on? They don't mean, you know when you leave the eggs there, some of them they'll like, I guess like some of them sometimes they'll peck away at their eggs, no, eat them and you have to like make sure that they don't do that. They're really stupid man. They're stupid as fuck.

Speaker 5:          00:54:06       But when they get broody when they get broody is when they think that somehow or another one of these eggs, even though there's no rooster, is going to become a baby. So they sit on it and they don't want to get off of it and then they start pecking at their belly and fluffing it up and it gets ugly. But you can fix it as long as you catch it early and catch it early, you just put them on a perch. So it was a smaller box and the coyote got under it and smashed the bottom of it and stole the chicken. It's fucked up, man. Clever little cunt. You ever get attacked by a chicken ever? They never bit, you know, but if they did, that'd be the end of their life. That my rules. Right. I'm just kidding. But deal. You don't, you don't raise them to eat them?

Speaker 5:          00:54:45       No. No. They're like little pets. The pets, their pets that make food. I feel bad. I was more sensitive to the loss of your chicken. No, I mean I would, I would do that. I named chicken. Yeah. I don't, my kids do. I don't. I'm like, I don't have any desire to eat these chickens. Like they're cool. I like having him around. I like, uh, I like eating their eggs, but it's so really weird thing that by other chicken from the grocery store, like I'll go to the grocery store and buy chickens. He's completely murdered, fucked up chicken. You don't get to ever look at its face. You know, you don't have to cut its neck and see its last blood jump out of it. You don't have to really recognize what it is you're doing and you're eating a chicken, right. You're just letting the supermarket supermarket hit man. Take care of all the dirty work for you?

Speaker 4:          00:55:34       Well, it's almost like we've got this hamster that's in a cage in our house, which is really to me the saddest thing in the world because he's alone and nobody holds him. My daughter picks him up like once a week for about 20 minutes tops and the rest of the time he knows on the bars to get out. And I just think like this is the most pathetic existential existence this thing lives in and I hate that we have as a pet. And then we had a mouse that was loose and we set a trap and I was like, this mouse, that hamster are a fucking chromosome apart and why don't we hold and pat and give a little a

Speaker 5:          00:56:07       bath and a little fucking butter dish. And the other one I'm trying to snap his neck with a spring. Well, how about squirrels, man? I mean, squirrels have this free ride in the road and community. Nobody hates squirrels. Yeah, everybody hates but squirrels. All they had to do was get cute. All them do. Listen, just stay an herbivore. Don't go eating animal protein and gross out in pretty girl big fluffy tail that looks cute with did a little tail show. I do little tail show and they chew and a little nuts and everybody thinks their cute little kids walk up to these wild rodents and they'll give them nuts. Could you imagine this? You saw your little kid walking up to a fucking rat. How much you'd be terrified, but they're there. Like we were so confident in their behavior that will just walk up to them, give them peanuts.

Speaker 5:          00:57:00       I to love our ice, love squirrels. We had him where I grew up. I used to feed him all the time. Give him a little peanuts. There's a park in north Hollywood that you could go to. And um, the squirrels, apparently people have been feeding them forever. So they come up to you when they see you, they're like, you, you got something. You got something for me. And I watched this one dude, this old Chinese guy, he, he laid down on a blanket. You had a bag of peanuts and it would just slowly like reach his hand out and squirrels would come over and just take it from him. They were so confident. Yeah. It's just Greg. I mean he's holding a peanut. They've just taken it from him and they just step back just a little bit and they would eat it. They didn't worry about him or they're just a rodent.

Speaker 5:          00:57:35       The got cute. That's it. I mean is this fight going back to the wolf? Like the dogs that we have today are just the wolves that were able to be around man. They were able to chill the fuck out, grab some scraps. Man liked him cause he was protection. Yeah. Wolf like the mad because he was giving him food and he, but he, but it weeded out the vicious ones until they got smaller and cuter and we crafted them to be the little lapdogs we wanted. The crazy thing is how short of a time it takes to do that, to change these animals. Like we don't know how long it took before wolves became dogs, but they did this experiment. They do well, it was listening to this podcast on radio lab, I forget the name of it, but it was about wolves and they did this experiment on, I was about dogs with dogs and they're wild nature, whatever the fuck it was.

Speaker 5:          00:58:22       But they did this experiment with foxes where this guy was raising foxes and whenever he would go towards like the cage where the Fox Fox were, if the foxes were um, scared of him, if they like feared him, if there was any like aggression towards him, he'd killed those foxes. So the only foxes that he let stay alive where the foxes that were actually like happy to see people. And then over time they did this over a period of like 10 years, they literally changed the way the foxes looked. They changed the way their face look. Their face became smaller, their bones became more petite, they became different colors. They're cheap. They're, their colors changed their, their overall, even the males, their bodies became much more feminine and they became domesticated like in 10 years to the point where you would go near the Fox cage and they would wag their tail and like whimper to be near you.

Speaker 5:          00:59:20       Like they wanted to be near people and they were in a fucking for factory essentially. Wow. They're killing these things. And this guy recorded all this stuff and did these, these studies over the period of like 10 years changed the foxes that he had changed them. And George Orwell buck was just something about the reaction to adrenaline that some of these animals didn't have the same reaction to adrenaline that did the same, uh, response to seeing strangers. And that those, by favoring those, you sort of domesticated this animal like very quickly. And the idea behind it was they were trying to make an analogy towards people like that were kind of doing that with society. If you look at the way people used to be, like there was some study recently about um, uh, hunter gatherers and the difference between their bones and our bones, their bones were much more dense and cause he's, you know, as people were working from the time they were babies, I mean they, they just never stopped like picking things up and climbing hills and like they were constantly at work.

Speaker 5:          01:00:22       But we're becoming like more and more fragile as we sit at desks all day and sit in our car to get dark desk and sit on the couch to watch TV after you're done and then read a book in bed. I mean fucking were falling apart. We're like mush and that, you know, when you really think about that, like that's kind of very similar to what is happening with those foxes. It's just a matter of preferring one type of behavior, not breeding with the other ones. And they think their premise was about like the best way to eliminate like war and eliminate all these different negative aspects of our culture would be four. And people said this for people like that, to just people stop fucking them. Stop fucking savages. Stop fucking all the people that want to go to war. Yeah. I give as as a, as a rule like all across the world, if women just stop fucking all men who want to go to war.

Speaker 4:          01:01:20       Well if you think about it and stay with me on this cause it's a little dark. But if the people that are natural soldiers, they are going to war and they are dying without breeding as much as the guys that, that are afraid to go to war. Right. So in a sense there is some natural selection. If that is a gene, if there is a gene that makes you more, you know, uh, likely to, to want to go to battle,

Speaker 5:          01:01:46       um, that kind of makes Hans someone's car alarm. Isn't that hilarious? Like back in the day, car alarms were like something that anybody took seriously. Oh my God. Yeah. There's a car alarm going on. I bet this is a crime now. It's like asshole, you know, is in the back or the front

Speaker 3:          01:02:07       front.

Speaker 5:          01:02:08       Yeah. You go take a look at it if you want. Just make sure it's not one of ours. One of our hardest moves. Somebody hit your car and that's why the alarms going. Yeah, that is possible

Speaker 6:          01:02:20       is in the back. Oh, then don't worry about it. Fuck these people with their gun. Remember those ones that would do like different door. My, I remember in a way I lived in little Italy. This fucking Cadillac got tapped and it played the theme from the Godfather.

Speaker 7:          01:02:40       Nn Nnn, Nnn, nnn.

Speaker 6:          01:02:46       That's hilarious. I remember everybody used to have that one alarm. That one type of alarm.

Speaker 6:          01:02:57       Yeah. That you'd be like, fuck somebody who was always so many bumping into it. Whether they were parking and they do used to go. They used to go for way longer. Now usually people are near their car. They, it's almost always somebody set it off by accident, which means it usually stops pretty quickly. Yeah. But back then it would go on for 10 15 minutes and you'd be going out of your fucking mind. You're sitting there trying to write it on your computer, whatever death. Yeah. Those things are fucking distracting shit. When they came along with noise, reducing headphones. Dot Is, that was a beautiful thing to be able to sit and have. If you had like noise reducing headphones on right now and you could totally filtered that out. Yeah, most of it. Well the Mike's probably didn't pick up on that. Do you think they did?

Speaker 6:          01:03:39       Yeah. If some of these like got headphones on. Yeah, but they could hear it. That was pretty fucking loud. But those Bose ones, I mean I've got a pair, I've had the same pair but it this way, I've had them long enough that I got replacement. You know the rubber padding thing in the middle. Yeah. I was in a Bose store and I was like, Oh fuck you can buy replacements. Cause I, I had stopped using it because they just wore out and I popped in some new ones. I haven't, I swear to God, 10 years I've had these things. Wow. They still, I don't think they make a better version. It's like one of those products, you know, they make a, they make a year of it like the Honda Civic and like 1982 it was like a perfect fucking car. Yeah. There was a bunch of cars from that era that are like, to this day, like they're becoming like really valuable.

Speaker 6:          01:04:17       Like Volvo DL land cruisers. Yeah. They're t those old Toyota land cruisers. Yeah. People are taking those Land Cruiser is still the old ones that looked like jeeps and even the newer ones like after that and they're fixing them up and selling them for over a hundred thousand dollars. What? Yeah, no shit. Yeah. There's a company called icon and a day they make incredible cars, man. I mean it's like you're talking about very, very expensive shit and I agree. I mean, it's not necessarily something that I would buy it because it is a lot of fucking money and uh, but they take these like Broncos and they take it old bronco, they take the shell and they completely redo it with the highest end components, like the best suspension possible. A completely modern engine, you know, with like 400 horsepower, they take a coyote engine from the 5.0 Mustang. So it's a Mustang gt engine like this crate engines, beautiful engine. They stick it in an old bronco. Those really cool old, I love those body. You got to see it. Pull it up. The convertible

Speaker 5:          01:05:18       ones, icon Bronco, pull up the silver one cause there's a fucking silver one that if it doesn't make all this money for the non five, well it's not just the body, it's the engineering. Like this guy. Um, I forget his name. I think Jonathan Ward, I think his name is the guy who is the uh, the lead CEO. Whatever the fuck he is president of this company. Just leave that thing on there for a second so I can stare at it. Good Lord. That's beautiful. Look at that fucking truck kind of long. That Hood is God. Damn, that's a fucking work of art man. It's like something you played with as a kid and dreamed of driving. Yeah. Like when you think about a regular truck, like regular trucks are cool, you know, hey, you know you got kids, you want to pile them into an Escalade, that's cool. But if you see that thing driving down the street, I mean that's like some mad Max Apocalypto wonder ride. It's a cool west side car too cause it looks like you could take it on the beach. You could take that on the beach. You can take that wherever the fuck you want to go.

Speaker 4:          01:06:13       Well that's what I think about is when the shit hits the fan and it's going to, in La, obviously there's going to be some type of a terrorist strike or there's going to be a poisoning. Easy, easy, easy. Greg Fitzsimmons I want to have, I've a Prius and my wife has a Toyota Highlander so if I want to get out, I know the way out because if I, if I live in Venice, I'm the last one in line for the 10 for the four or five for the Pacific coast highway. We were the last ones to leave la, like lock up on our way out. Everyone's a front of us. So I think, well you got two options. One of them is to jump on a boat. Like you gotta be able to Jerry Rig. It's something simple. Little fucking motor boat go off to Catalina Island. Waited out.

Speaker 4:          01:06:55       The other option is like, cause when I was a teenager, he used to ride motorcycles on the power lines because wherever there's power lines, they have to have a a path cleared underneath it so they can serve as the power lines. So if you drive dirt bikes, he always know if there's power lines is a good trail underneath it. Wow. So if you want to get out of La, you, you get on one of those power lines, but you need a truck like that. You need something with like a lot of clearance. Big Fat wheels. Dude.

Speaker 5:          01:07:22       Do you want to live? If the apocalypse hits like okay, lists their stages, the apocalypse power goes out. Apocalypse, that's going to suck. Yeah. Especially if it's in July. People are going to be hot as fuck. No one's gonna know what to do. People are going to be camping out in the beach cause they can't take living in the valley and the, in the middle of the summer there's going to be some shortages of food for sure. It's going to be some looting for sure. You cannot pump gas cause they're all electric pumps going to be a real problem until they figured out how to get the power back on. And you know, there's been situations in other parts of the world where power in a modern city has been off for weeks. Like Toronto apparently had some crazy ice storm in the 90s and you know, it was like fucking zero below 10 below zero, something like that. Horrible, horrible weather, you know, Celsius. Whatever they do up there. And these people had no power for like two fucking weeks. And in Toronto, Maya in the middle of the winter so that he could happen in La. Man, if it happened in la in the summer,

Speaker 6:          01:08:16       it can get ugly. Quick Stat would be one that's like one kind of apocalyptic. I can handle that. That's not that bad. But the real bad ones, like super volcano, earthquake, asteroidal impact, those are the big tsunami tsunami, tsunami zone. You probably aren't because the way the bay is shaped, you know, you've got, you know, from the Palisades down to whatever, Manhattan beach is all one half circle basically. And Venice is in the center of that half circle. So as the water is rushing in from a tsunami, it's all getting channeled into one opening, which is Venice beach. That shit's going to come straight down Venice Boulevard, take everything out. The canals, canals of the underwater. That's right. And it's canals, canals right through the city. Get out now, get out. Now actually we, we moved up the hill. We moved from Venice to Mar Vista, which is about a mile, but it's straight up hill. The people that live on the beach like right on the water or bold is fuck bold is fuck. You have to have some either some mad loot, whether it's like house number five, you know, CEO of Q tips or some shit.

Speaker 6:          01:09:27       And his house is shaped like a cue tip. And the servants were placed with real cotton every day. Oh, that would be it. Q tips mad because people are not going to stop using Q tips and there's no like nobody wants the generic ones because the generic ones are like they get flat qtip stay fluffy shit. Who's the asshole that makes those qtip fake Q tips with plastics. Yeah. Cut the inside of your ear cause you dig around the fucking cotton falls right off. She get us now you got a cocktail straw in your ear. Now they get the real cute tips is like one of those again going back to like the 82 civic or uh, it's just there. They made perfect products in St Louis. Just you nail it. You got it. Walk away. Walk away. Walk away. He know certain cameras like a, I don't know what kind of camera you got but die of the uh, those old cannons.

Speaker 6:          01:10:21       The original like first generation Canon video cameras, they were high eight. They were beautiful pieces of machinery. That's, I have one that I still use to this day. Whoa. Yeah. I mean, if you've got really good shit, it does the purpose and does it a really high level, you, you essentially could just maintain it forever. That's what they've been really doing in Cuba with cars. You know, if you go to Cuba, you look at their cars, apparently a large percentage of them are American automobiles from like the fifties or sixties big ass car. It's crazy and beautiful and in really good shape. Oh yeah. I think that's what that guy's doing with those icons. He's just taking these old cars and just putting the best components on it and building, you know like what it could have been guys from Europe come over here and they buy muscle cars and they just shipped him right over to Germany, double it. They're worth a lot of money in other countries. Yeah, there's a flavor. Those

Speaker 5:          01:11:13       things have to those American muscle cars at like the best engineered cars. My opinion or like the Japanese and the German and some of the Italians, they have some amazing engineered cars, but like the coolest cars, there's no question like just straight cool 69 Mustang rolls up 10 just shut the fuck up. Everybody shut the fuck up. You have a Ferrari and a Lamborghini, you doors open up like wings stop. Just stop suddenly pulls up one of those Eleanor mustangs and those 67 gt five hundreds just like good Lord. What a beautiful car that is. So simple. They just nailed it. Yeah, like those core vets like give her a c those Corvettes from like like 1968 69 that that the sting ray car, beautiful fucking and the wide tires and the wide backend rumble. That engine,

Speaker 6:          01:12:11       it looked like a lion about to pounce with big back conscious and just,

Speaker 5:          01:12:16       they just nailed it. You don't know what drugs they were doing when they were designing cars in the 60s but they just fucking nailed it. Right. They nailed it over, over and over again. Barracuda's Ma, I mean everyone, they'd be creating these fucking masterpiece. Yeah, they're getting back to that now for sure. Like the cars look better today than it did for a long time. But I would really like to know what the fuck happened, what, what happened in like the 1980s where things went so bad? Like I know there's peaks and valleys and a lot of things, but in American automobile design it doesn't make any sense.

Speaker 6:          01:12:49       Yeah. And at the exact same time as when the Japanese cars that are coming out, just when we need it to be at our best to compete, we suddenly just, I don't know what the, you know, the factories where they, I don't know. I bet there's probably two versions of the story. There's the pro union version and the con Union version. Yeah. Oh, I'm sure there's a lot of people that blame the unions. I mean, it's tough because I just talking to somebody who's very pro union yesterday and I, I'm very pro union, but I'm starting to slip a little bit in some ways. Like, I'm, I'm in the writer's guild and I'm very, you know, I walk the walk, I walked away from a deal so I could walk the picket line and my dad was in the radio union after for his whole career.

Speaker 6:          01:13:27       That's what left left my mom a pension and I, and I believe that there should be a living wage for people, but I also think, God, how do we fix these fucking corrupt procon engines? Like what? Corrupt, broken engines union wise, you mean like things like, well, construction, certain, you know, a kind of shield, something. It's really gotten to the point where you're just getting squoze from every direction and it's adding, it's adding, you know, I, I'd rather see another guy get a job then see the union just absorbed that much more money. Well, any times you have your bureaucracy, bureaucracy, anytime you have a large number of people that are involved in something that really only needs a couple people, you know, I mean how many people really need be involved in going over your construction plans or how many people really need, I mean, yeah,

Speaker 5:          01:14:16       once you establish environmental parameters and shit, like things like people trying to fix their house up or something like that. Like how many people really need to be involved in this? Like are you hiring a contractor? Does the contract and no one is doing? Yes. Okay. Well we're good. Yeah. Like let me just get the fuck out of your hair. Yeah. Like what do you, unless you're doing something dangerous and we're just going to assume that everyone's doing something dangerous now there's a lot of people are getting paid off too. I have a friend who is trying to get a house built and uh, they're dealing with this, a commission in this area, this particular area. They're trying to develop a house and they've literally been told like, you have to like Greece wheels. You have to like to get things moving to get things approved.

Speaker 5:          01:14:53       Do you have to like get on people's good side? Like there's saying thanks to these people like to indicate that I came that you might monitor by these people, something you might want to bribe them. You want to be friends with them. He, the closer you can get to these people, the easier they'll lube this process of like what? This is so bizarre because it's like they have power over you. This is not like there's real clear parameters. This is how we operate. Regardless of whether or not we'd like you or don't like, you know, there's like this, like this little wiggle room going on. I mean that's essentially what corruption really is, right? It's wiggle,

Speaker 6:          01:15:24       Bro. It's like it's never, nobody ever states it as corruption. Nobody ever says black and white. I'm bribing this guy. It's just I happen to take this guy out to dinner. Well, it starts there. Well, well, was that the difference between him going with you and going with somebody else? Very likely. Well then that's a bribe. That's true. Right. And in a lot of ways, I mean, you should be able to hire whoever the fuck you want if it's your money and your job. But when you're talking about something like a union that's involved and construction are unions involved and you know, coastal commissions, those type of things know where people are deciding whether I like the groups of people that decide whether or not this happens to or that doesn't happen. Yeah. Yeah. Things get real weird. Man Can, is ridiculous. Apparently. Like, you know, uh, they tried to build a high speed railroad or they did build a high speed power and the you the, not the unions, but uh, you know, the different, um, levels of bureaucracy within the government and privately we're squeezing everybody to the point where the project was 10 times as much as it should have been.

Speaker 6:          01:16:27       And then the train started crashing because they were trying to save so much money. They're putting inferior parts in. Yeah. That's where the argument for unions come in, right?

Speaker 5:          01:16:36       Cause it's not a, um, it's not a black and white issue. Like I definitely think, look, we're talking about Foxconn and all those people that are being forced to work for such a horrible waves that jumping off roofs, you Kinda, you gotta establish like a living wage. You got to establish if people are working for you and this is a valuable thing they're doing for you. Like you have to pay them enough so they could feed themselves, clothe themselves like you can't. So like in the in and then, you know, healthcare and all the different things that are going to come up. I mean, you're a piece of their organization and they're, they're demanding to be recognized as a valuable piece of the organization. Like you can't have all the money. Like that's what it is. You have people working for you, you need to pay them.

Speaker 5:          01:17:17       That makes sense. But it's like whenever you get a group that is exploiting these, uh, these laws that are in place to protect people, like that's when shit gets weird. Like my buddy was in the automotive industry in Detroit. He was in the auto workers union and he was telling me like how crazy some of the contracts were and some of the gigs where they had this thing where you would both work, you would have a two man contract. Like meaning that this was, uh, this not a two man contract, a two man job, like this job to run this machine. It really only took one guy, but they would, the union would require two men. So you guys get two guys get jobs. So you, you're both, you would do four hours a day, like you would do four hours in the morning and uh, I would come in at noon and I would take over and uh, I would do the job for the next four hours. And then you go to the gym, you go fucking have lunch. You literally would work four hours a day. Yeah. And that's what they all did. And they all were making like 150 grand a year. I mean, it was crazy money. He was talking about how much money these different workers were making. It's like, you know, if you got to a certain level, like you got benefits, you got this. It was like super expensive to keep all those people employed at that.

Speaker 6:          01:18:26       Not only that, but for that money that you're paying them, you're also paying a 13% into the union which pays for the benefits so that you know, if what, what's $50 an hour to that worker actually costs the employer. You know, what's 12% of $50 six, six, $7. Something along those lines. Does it matter that I need to break down that uh, no math? No, I don't think, I think your listeners get it. Yeah.

Speaker 5:          01:18:53       I think unions if used correctly or a a nice sort of insurance to people getting paid a fair wage and getting treated ethically and having, you know, money distributed in an ethical and fair way. There was no problem with anything is things don't always go the way they should.

Speaker 6:          01:19:13       Best case scenario. Yeah. It's almost like you got to start over again with the unions. You got to get the, like the Teacher's Union is insane. You got women in there. There was a woman that a women, there's melting, dare you know you met this one woman though that works at my kid's school and she had liquor on her breath and she was like just ignoring the class and reading the paper and like they couldn't get rid of her. They just, yeah. It was just impossible to get rid of her. There's so much you have to go through. We'll 10 years. A weird thing, man. And I had this professor after three years as a teacher. That's it. Three years. Welcome to the jungle though. You got to survive three years. Yeah. Yeah. Especially in La. He deserve it. Ooh. You get through three years of working in La, babysitting kids, your gray hair. The women are balls. He's just beaten down. Yeah. Ulcers and shit. Fucking how many kids brought a gun? Just class today. It's a weird world, man. It's a weird world. There's so many haves and have nots in this world.

Speaker 1:          01:20:08       I don't know. Doesn't seem to be any solution or anybody reaching for it. But that might be the one thing that's ever going to level anything out when it comes to unions. Yeah. I mean having, having groups of people that uh, are all behaving in an ethical way, having them in a, in a large number, like whether it's a, you know, a big group like the actors union or whether it's a carpenter's union or it's just, it's fucking really hard. It's really hard to get people all together in a group like that to act ethically, to just always be cool to always do it

Speaker 4:          01:20:40       gray. I mean, unions just split apart. There was the writer's guild east and the writer's guild west, which effectively, you know, destroy the power of either one. There was aftra and sag, which are both actors. Unions have, should it, they're finally combined now, but it should have been, it should right now should be the DGA, which is the director's guild. The writer's guild and the actors union should all be under the same to end a Yahtzee, which is like the technical guys should all be one union because what they do is the studios, we'll line it up so that they, uh, the contract for the actors union comes up in January every two years, but then they set up the writer's guild to renew in February every two years that they make them off here. So that way you've never got everybody, uh, lining up against you want a union contract at the same time the, and they can, they can, can everybody do what kind of disagreements or they have like when you have disagreements and like the actors union or something like that.

Speaker 4:          01:21:37       Mostly it's digital downloads, which is a battle that everybody lost, you know, that that should have been, I mean, I just got a residual check on a TV show that I did and I got, first I got the check for the reruns on TV, the cable reruns. Then I got the one for digital online. And, uh, the one on cable was like 1700 bucks and the same usage period on digital was like $13 and it's like probably more views digitally than it was on cable. But we gave that away during the last strike. Ooh. They weren't looking down the road. They were really fighting for network and cable reuse. CIJ and they weren't looking at the, missed it. Yeah. Netflix, all this shit that's taken off. We're barely getting a taste.

Speaker 1:          01:22:20       That's crazy. Yeah, they miss that. That's a big one. It's the whole future. Wow. That is so nuts. Yeah. But what, but there's benefits to having a union. Like what, what do you, what do you think are like the primary benefits of,

Speaker 4:          01:22:33       well I've had my health coverage cause I've been in the writer's guild for like 13 years straight, so I've had my health insurance paid for. It's amazing coverage, low deductible, low premiums. It's like I think I pay like 250 bucks a quarter or something crazy and I'm paying third 13 grand. I pay, I was, I was in the Union for 12 years out for one year and I'm now I'm back in again. And that one year that I had off, I paid $13,000 for my family. So that's, you know, that's a lot of money right there. And then you get the residuals to come in, which is big and um, you don't get abused, you know, you have certain, like you get meals you get, um, they can't, they can only work a certain number of hours. I mean, there's not too many people that dig in on that, but the spirit of it is there, you know, producers know that they, if you're in the union that they're not going to, I've worked on both sides of it. I've worked non union jobs and as per, as a producer, not a writer because I can't, but I've seen the hours that you work and how you writer's guild jobs, you get, you can take an hour for lunch

Speaker 5:          01:23:38       and you also get treated in a pretty commensurate way. Right. You know, like when you're in a, a sag TV show or something like that. I was like, it's pretty across the board or was professional like as far as like, you know, you've got the craft service table, this is where your dressing room is, you know, you're out by x amount of times, you have a 12 hour turnover. Like they have all these rules they have to follow by those rules. When they go over, like they get all bummed out. Like everybody gets pumped out. Yeah, it's a super expensive. When they start going over time

Speaker 4:          01:24:08       and money, money talks, that makes them get, there's no way, like most shows shouldn't take more than eight hours to shoot, you know? And instead it takes 15 why do you think that is? Because everybody wants to brand whatever it is that they're putting into the project. You know, if you're the hairstylist, he want the hair to look perfect. If your, you know, the, the set Kai you want, you, you need an extra 20 minutes to do this as opposed to if there's penalties, it's like, no, we got to fucking go get it done and then we're gonna move on. So I think with cable there's usually not a strong hand on the, on the, uh, on the wheel as much as there is an in network shows where there's somebody that's a show runner that really has to answer to the studio and say, no, we are done at 6:00 PM that's it.

Speaker 4:          01:24:52       You know, maybe they go an hour long. But I work on cable shows where I worked on one and it was a [inaudible] wife, tiny and her ghetto fabulous friends. Oh, what'd you do on it was a panel show. I was a, what was I on that? I was the head, I was the show runner on that. And uh, they came in and we were supposed to start taping it. Four o'clock started at 7:00 PM because they all were getting their hair done and it was a cat fight. The next night we're taping again. Supposed to be four o'clock taping seven 30. Wow. Yeah, it was fucking money. That is, that's a lot of money. You're paying everybody just for three and a half hours. Right. And then you're going along, which means now you're going into overtime wages on the other side. So

Speaker 5:          01:25:39       there's many good things about having a union. So many good things about them. Oh yeah. Yeah. Some unions that are fucked, man, there's a, there's a big dispute right now with the UFC in the culinary union and the Culinary Union is the attack the UFC and make all these like websites and posts and they have like stories that they, uh, they have people write about how horrible the UFC is because they want the UFC to give up a station. Casinos

Speaker 1:          01:26:04       owns, uh, the UFC, the UFC is owned by [inaudible]. They own station casinos. They owned the UFC and they own a 22 casinos. And if those casinos went union, they're not union or non union. And I guess I'm, I might be speaking as school here. I don't really know. I believe check this, that the workers don't want it to be union. Like they voted against it because they didn't want to pay the wages. But if they did pay the wages there, ha. I guess they're happy with what they make. I don't, I pay the dues, the dues, but if they did do it, the Culinary Union would make some insane amount of money every year. Millions dollars every year. Yeah. So what they do is they have this like smear campaign, like constant smear campaign about the UFC and they hired politicians and one of them, I actually just got busted, one of the main guys in New York that they had supposedly that had been a roadblock to getting the UFC legalized in New York.

Speaker 1:          01:26:56       UFC is not legal in New York still. No, still to this day it's illegal in New York state. The reason being because of corrupt politicians and all brick goes back to the culinary union trying to keep the UFC, uh, it like trying to turn the station casinos into um, union casinos. Right? So they're spending all this money and like getting people upset about the UFC and making all these nutty websites. And anytime anybody says anything fucked up, anytime anything goes wrong, the color and union was ditch jumps all over it. And they're just trying to muscle the UFC and to relinquishing control of these casinos. It's a, that's allegedly the story. Obviously I don't know all the details so I should probably say for legal purposes, this is how it's been told to me. Yeah. But ultimately you know that if there's a lot of money to be made and you've got some organization that relies on keeping strong numbers of members, they're going to be, you know, financially motivated to try to make things cheap.

Speaker 1:          01:27:54       I had a buddy was in the teamsters like when I was a kid and I was like 21, 22 years old. He was a, in the end he, he would uh, work the docks, he would filet fish all day and he had a dent in his hip and the dent in his hip was from his hip pressing up against the fish filet table all day looking at a dent, very like one hip was like dented in and be like, you're an adult, your radios ducted. Cause he just leaned all day and leaned all day and he always smelled like fish. Oh always smelled like fish. This poor bastard. I don't mean to laugh. I mean the guys making a living, but when a life, yeah, totally. Shit. He was a, he was my boxing coach and so he would, when he would rub this, uh, like Vaseline stuff on your face and stuff called Abilene so that like punches when they, they hit you, they slide, they don't cut you. Yeah. The leather doesn't cut. You see, he'd rub this stuff all over your face. You just smell fish, fish and Abilene and he'd just be rubbing it. He, so he was filleting fish and training as a boxer. Yeah. He's one of the craziest guys I've ever met. He, uh, he got his finger bit and often a street fight and they replaced it with his toe and they curved it permanently so he could still throw right hooks,

Speaker 6:          01:29:02       crazy Irishman, Joe Lake, which tell the big toe, uh, they took the second toe, not the big tub with the one next to it, I guess you don't use, you don't use that. I guess you don't need it. Just strengthen up those last three babies. Keep that party role on with no toe. Now. I mean, the thing is, if you think about a finger, each one individually is dealing with things but your toes, it just, that you don't even really need. And we could get rid of toes at this point. No, they do help you. They help you with movement, with movement and you know, like they're, they're adjustable. I, she had a balance yourself. Like you need toes. It fucks with people when they lose a toe, they lose a lot of, uh, their ability to move around. Yeah. It's not the same. I used to caddy for this guy that, uh, something happened to him in Vietnam and uh, his feet were paralyzed, so like his ankles work but like is from the ankle down.

Speaker 6:          01:29:53       Everything was just fucking dead. And this guy walked, he walked like he'd have to almost bring his knee up in the front every time he'd stepped forward. Like ski boots. Yeah. Almost like that. And then he would, uh, he'd hit the ball and it just, it never could hit it straight because you need, you know, you need balance. But the guy fucking loved golf. He played like two rounds a day. Do you have to caddy for him to be all over the course? Look over this guy's fucking ball. Fucking numb feet. That's so weird. What a weird ailment. Dead Feet. Oh, I guess probably happy. That was it. Yeah. Right on all the shit that could go wrong. I know. I know a dude who broke his toe really bad and they told him he couldn't do Jujitsu for six months if they were going to fix it to or they can amputate it.

Speaker 6:          01:30:36       So he said cut it off. No Shit. Which tell a, I think it was like the same one by my success. Which toes are in each story? I think it was the one next to the big toe. Yeah. I might be wrong. One of his toes. If you had to lose one toe, which one would it be? Uh, that little. Hmm. That's a good question. I was going to say that free loader toe right next to the little toe. All right. Fuck it. The ring finger. Yeah, toad doesn't it does nothing. I never paid attention to until, yeah, look washed out tow a million times in my life. Never looked at it twice. Do you go look at my pinky toe? I'll check it out cause it's weird. I look at that tiny little nail. Go leave the stupid nail. You know, I'll look. It's like a clipping of another now.

Speaker 6:          01:31:25       It's not even it's own nail but the little toe next to the pinky toe. No love gets no lo. Do you get in there and individually watch your toes. I used to it now. Now I don't give up. You got no, no desire slapping on the top. Slab it on the bottom down. I wash my feet, you know in between. I'm always doing stuff barefoot. Yeah, like I lift weights barefoot. I do kickboxing, barefoot. Jujitsu's barefoot. It's all barefoot. You got to get in there. You also got to make sure you don't get athlete's foot like athlete's foot is what you, when you get that, those cracks underneath your toes, like get the base where the the ball

Speaker 5:          01:32:00       of your foot reaches the bottom of your title. Like that gets all dry and fucked up and cracks and it hurts. And a lot of that comes from your toes being dirty. Yeah. It comes from like weird fungus getting in there. And apparently this is the same, like the same as ringworm. Like athlete's foot is kind of the same. Fungus is ringworm. It's just in a different spot on your body and Jock itch all same shit. Yeah, that's right. Jackets, just athlete's foot. Yeah. It's some fucking funk growing on your dick boy. Yeah, right. Yeah. God, I would hate, I would hate that. It's important if anybody's listening to this though, if you do have some funk on you, um, whatever you do, don't use antibacterial soap. Don't ever use that stuff. If you use antibacterial soap, soap, I mean, unless you're a hospital, you know, pay worker, you're a, you know, a doctor or something and then you should use it.

Speaker 5:          01:32:49       But there's stuff called um, defense soap that is a, a probiotic. It's a, it, it discourages the growth of bad bacteria, but it promotes healthy bacteria and it's all like natural oils. They use like um, eucalyptus oil and tea tree oil and it just like staff and ringworm and all that stuff. It's really good for grapplers. That's why it's called defense soap. They made it for grapplers, but for anybody like for keeping like healthy skin flora that, and here's a big one, dude, this is really big probiotics. Fucking I drank this shit all the time. Yeah, you telling me about that? So important. Yeah. Yeah. These are organisms like live organisms. You take them into your body and literally strengthens your immune system like acidophilus. I was reading this thing where they were saying that acid off lists they believe can discourage when you touch things like say if you touch something and it's got some sort of a funk on it and then you accidentally touch your face.

Speaker 5:          01:33:44       Well, if you're taking healthy doses of acidophilus, apparently acid office will resist the introduction of new bacteria. They're like, Whoa, whoa bitch, what are you doing here? What the fuck are you doing here? Whereas if you have that antibacterial, so your skin is like devoid of even healthy bacteria. Yeah. Does healthy flora is just as important, like you can't like strip it off. It's just as important to keep the healthy flora as it is to get rid of the bad shit. Yeah. The um, uh, somebody, so we told me I was reading an article about bacteria and it's like there's a pretty big percentage of your body that's made up of bacteria. Yeah. It's huge. Like the amount of weight and your body's like 12 pounds or something of bacteria. This is the way I saw it explained once. It really rang that number up. But it's a lot. This is the way I saw a scientist explain that. So I'm pretty sure he's correct. He said there's more eco lie in your gut than I've ever been. People ever. Wow. Whoa.

Speaker 8:          01:34:41       Yeah.

Speaker 5:          01:34:43       Yeah we did. It's just sitting there while it's doing, it's working like it. Healthy stomach bacteria is like very important for digestion. That's what you're getting when you're absorbing like these Kombucha is and shit like that. You're changing your, your gut and there's a lot of studies that are trying to link that to autism and they think that autism and poor gut bacteria in the intestinal tract, bacteria, it might be an issue, the inflammation factor that inflammation might cost or it's all sorts of distress throughout the entire body. Like as a, you know, the, the symbiosis of your stomach, your digestive tract, your circulatory system and your brain, all of them together being affected equally that this digestive disorder might also fuck with people's heads.

Speaker 2:          01:35:27       Yeah. Yeah. I got my guts fucked man. I fart soft shits pain. My Gut is wrong. Well, how's your diet? Diet's great. Really fantastic. So what the fuck? I think I got GRD when I was in Florida like 20 years ago and I never really got rid of it ever since I got it. I've had gas, Johnny are you get that from drinking water? The animals shit in right down to Florida. They don't have fresh water very much in Florida. So what were you doing? How'd you get it? Just staying in a hotel. Me, me and my wife. She got rid of it. I never did. You got it from all hotel? Yeah. What? Yeah. How the fuck did you get it? Because they don't have a lot of groundwater in Florida. They fucking pump all that shit in from out of town. So like the tap water cave, you chop water gave us GRD.

Speaker 2:          01:36:15       Jesus fucking Christ. I went on like three different cycles of, I figured it was tetracycline or something to the point where the doctor was like, you can't keep taking this and it should just, it should equal out. And I've gone back and it never has. Oh my God, Dude. That's insane. I've been far to once we've been in here by the way, that wouldn't do it. Thank you. I appreciate that. I would fart. Um, it, I did fart in an elevated recently and the, someone did the running leg hand in, opened the doors and they came in and I just looked at him like, hey, it's an asshole move. Mine was an asshole move, but you don't open up elevator doors on somebody, so let's take a ride.

Speaker 5:          01:36:54       So because he shoved his arm in the elevator door.

Speaker 2:          01:36:58       No, I had just farted and then I saw the hand come in. It's not, you don't like people showing the hand through. I don't think you should do that ever. Unless it's like if you're in a parking structure in Santa Monica, that's six stories and there's like one elevator. So it comes every 12 and you could stick your hand in that. But if I'm into like an an office complex and there's like six banks of elevators or a hotel, you don't stick your hand in the door. Wow. But what if the guy's in a super hurry? He can wait for the next elevator. I'm in a super hurry to always have sim. It's looking for excuses to fart on people. Take stand. Is that what this is yours? This is just an excuse to force it on people. Well the other thing is if you put all, forget that I'm, that it's valley parking somewhere. Like if I go to the comedy store, I always forget and I'll fart before I get there. And I was like, Oh fuck, sorry doc. So

Speaker 5:          01:37:48       does Giardia like you saw a noticeable change from the way you were?

Speaker 2:          01:37:51       Oh yeah. Immediate, immediate damn fuck no, it's way better than it was, but it's still there. I got to watch what I eat. Like I'm lactose intolerant now

Speaker 5:          01:38:02       my friend Steve or no, he got Giardia and then he got trichinosis so she to from bad beef, but his was for bad bear. Oozes from eating a bear. But apparently he keeps it for life. Like they kill it in your stomach, like it lives in your stomach and then it, it goes like it migrates into your, your muscle cells and it hurts like a fall. She have like agony, like muscle agony. Like you're in pain. Like your back hurts, your shoulders hurt. They can't kill that. They just plant spores in you. So essentially this rude of crazy, the shit that's in your stomach that's gone. But the stuff that's in your, your arms and your legs and your, your tissue stays there for the rest of your life. Those spores, like if you ate him, if you were in the of the apocalypse came around, you've got to cook them 260 degrees, 160

Speaker 2:          01:38:50       hall. Let me write that down. One to 60 bill. Oh, speaking of which, by the way, can I plug some dates fall again? What'd we got? Addison, Texas coming to see you folks. February 28th. March 1st. Yeah. It's not a great room. Fucking room on the second floor and uh, it's just a perfect shape. It's been around forever too. So it's soaked with laughter. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Speaker 5:          01:39:12       Like the, the different sets that have been in that room. That's a great room. Addison, Texas, they still have the piano bar right next door. Oh yeah. That's a great

Speaker 2:          01:39:20       a hand job shack to right around the corner. How dare you, I didn't go. How dare you even know. No, I walked past it and I saw this guy who was loitering out front and he just kept like walking back and forth and I was like, why is this guy hanging out in front? And then I looked over and it's, and it was like a, somebody told me that you can net Tel it's a jack check because if it has a neon footprint on it, those are the jacket that's like a sign that it's a happy ending place. Really. That's what a certain comedian told me. I don't know if he's right, but isn't that like a reflexology thing? That's what they want you to think. No Shit. Yeah. So you go in, they rub your feet, just jerk you off. Have no idea. I didn't even touch your feet. If I had a choice, if I was going to do what I would say as long as I'm in here, you know, let's get the feet gone first.

Speaker 5:          01:40:06       Yeah. Some people like get weirded out about people touching their feet, only not into it at all.

Speaker 2:          01:40:12       I like women's feet. I enjoy looking at women's face.

Speaker 5:          01:40:20       Well when they're attractive, you know, I never attractive. It's great. What is it about that though? I mean, if not, I'm not asking you personally, but what is it about like, like why would a guy give a shit about a girl if it girls toes took a hook turn and her feet are all but like what? Why? What does it even affect us? Like why is it more desirable to see like perfect toes, right?

Speaker 2:          01:40:41       I mean it's just me. My personal thing is I believe it shows they're evil. They're haunted hammer toe equals haunted you, but she will kill you one day.

Speaker 6:          01:40:54       At that time you'll be sleeping. I'll send, you'll feel this little hook going around your trachea and you'll look and you'll see an ankle. Can you imagine if people were that transparent where the way their hands looked was like how deadly or nice they were? Yeah. So if people had beautiful, smooth, clean hands, you never had to worry about them. They're all knuckled up and fucked up after wine number. Her sisters had those nasty fucking feet. He couldn't fit in the shoes. That's right. She was the original foot fetish. Worship Goddess shoot was, but maybe she was just a part of a narrative. That's been going on forever. Like the Chinese people with their binding bindings. Yeah. It's the craziest shit of all. That's crazy. That's so frightening. But it's totally logical if you go back, I mean if you put it in context of going back, you could show wealth by saying it wasn't just the aesthetic of small feat.

Speaker 6:          01:41:40       It was also saying my bitch doesn't have to work. I can bind her feet. That's how much money I have. Good Lord. Yeah. Yeah. She could never work. Work in the fields. That's why Japanese people were fucking hats and sunblock and gloves because in their culture having fair skin is a sign of wealth. Wow. Right. Once you know in some cultures are trying to bleach people, like Filipinos are really getting into glutathione, which is I think it's like an amino acid or something like that. Some nutrition. I mean I, I take it actually it's like really good for your liver, but they, they're taking this stuff and through some injection process that I don't totally understand. It makes your skin lighter so they want to be like, maybe they're darker brown Filipinos. They want to be light because light, lighter state. That's what Michael Jackson did.

Speaker 6:          01:42:27       No, Michael Jackson had what I have. He had vitiligo. Yeah. If you look at my hands like you see these spots on my hands, I'm just a white guy so it doesn't look that freaky. But if I get a tan it can look pretty freaky. Like all my knuckles, like trauma areas are big areas that get it like knuckles because you know anytime you get cuts, scratches sometimes that can turn to Ville. Lygo I have to put like a, an ointment on it to keep it from spreading. Yeah. But um, plus you, your hairy so it just looks like patches, a hair on your knuckles. But Michael, but I'm a white guy. Again, it's not that much of a contrast between the area where I have pigment in the area where I don't have pigment. But if you're black, like Michael Jackson was when he was young.

Speaker 6:          01:43:08       It's super traumatic for a lot of people. Some people freak out, they have like some really good remedies for it now they've ointment that can pretty much stop it from spreading. And they have these poobah treatments that they do that re pigment areas. They're pretty good at it now. But the Michael Jackson days, they couldn't do shit. You know, I'm the opposite. I'm so fair that I try to, uh, I try to darken like on the weekends I put a black shoe Polish on my face and I go sing. Do you leave like a white thing around your mouth so you don't fuck your food up? I'll eat some pattern down. That's me flooring.

Speaker 6:          01:43:44       I'm also, I'm going to be at the helium comedy club. Oh, I forgot what we were doing. March 6th and seventh. Uh, don't forget Denver comedy works. I think it's your favorite club in the country. March 12th through 14th. You just rattled off two of my favorite clubs in the country. Helium and Philly is fucking amazing. Amazing. And uh, the comedy works where it did my last special rocky mountain high did that to calm me down was so great. It's the best club ever. Yeah, it's the best club. It's just so perfect. I mean, there's a bunch of the best clubs ever. You know, there's like five or six of them all over the country. Those are two of them. The top five right there. And then the Hollywood Improv, which is definitely up in that, uh, rankings. That's a great spot. March 21st that's a fucking great spot. The Hollywood improv is so that's such a good fucking room for comedy and such like a high level room.

Speaker 6:          01:44:35       You go there, you see Judd Apatow working out and you know, I mean you're there all the time. There's so many good comics there that's a, that's a fucking showcase spot man. And they run a tight, they keep it on time for the most part. You know, if they had a Arsenio hall dropped in one night and he did about 35 at the top of the shell on announced. And I spent a, I don't know, 16 at my 20 minutes shitting all over Arsenio Hall for going along and they, they have crowd fucking went crazy. I think he tanked it. Oh, did he really? Nothing like starting to show off with a tank and going, you know, over your five it dropped buys five minutes. That's all they were giving them. Yeah. Well that's not good, but I don't know, 10 minutes. What? What was his playing?

Speaker 6:          01:45:18       It was supposed to do any, hey, are you listening to Arsenio? Whoa. Throwing it down. I know that dude. He's a good guy. He's a very nice guy. I never met him. He's a very nice guy. He left before I started. I talked to him, um, really recently about a social media stuff when he was doing the new version of the Arsenio Hall show. They took over social media, like it's Facebook and it's Twitter and I'll let you, they asked to do that now. Like there was a, I was doing this one thing. They asked me to do that. They wanted to go over my Twitter. I go, fuck you. Like what? Are you crazy? But we're going to tweet for you the fuck you're going to tweet for me. Yeah. Like, no, you're not like you want to start a Twitter page for the show. Will you start that and then you can tweet from that.

Speaker 6:          01:46:00       You're not gonna tweet from my personal Twitter page just because I'm on a show. Like the idea that you have to give it up. Genius in the Digital Marketing Department brought that up in a meeting and they went, sounds like a good idea Phil. Will you imagine you have to be such a whore that you have to give up your Twitter page? Like get the fuck out of here. No, can't, no, you can't have my Twitter page. If you want me to tweet stuff, send it to me and I'll tweet it if I agree with it. Yeah, but you can't take boot for him. He didn't even think about it. He just, he like didn't think that it was a big deal. It was just like Yay, cool. But now he's trying to get it back. Like he was struggling to get it back under his own control after show was canceled. No Shit. I was like, this is ridiculous. Wow. They like, they own your social media presence, which is worth a fuck load of money. Yeah. Like, what if you did a project for, you know, name x production company and

Speaker 1:          01:46:50       in the project was they can tweet anything they want from your social media sites, Facebook, Twitter, Instagram. They can tweet anything they want. They're going to get put out anything they want. They would just release commercials all day. Yeah. I mean, imagine if that was in your contract and they just started putting out like, there's a tide commercial on your fucking Twitter feed tied. Got My clothes smelling fucking amazing breakfast Simmons. And then there's a video and you're like, watts, yeah, I can't believe this. And then you call your age and like, Look Greg, it's in the contract. He's like, Oh my God, I'm retired. And they like Mecca. It's funny, it's about the Greg Fitzsimmons show. It's funny, but it's also product placement. Yeah. He'd be like, oh no,

Speaker 4:          01:47:31       nobody can really write a tweet for you. That doesn't sound like it's not you. It's kind of like, because it's so tight, it's like it really has to be your wording. Yeah. You would have to get somebody who really knew you well. Like I put out, when I put out my podcast, I have my producer put out the tweet because he's the one that uploads it. So then I know that as soon as it uploads, he just sends a tweet saying, uh, so I, I give him a blurb to write ahead of time so that when it goes up, it's written. But sometimes if I don't give him one, he writes it and it just immediately, I don't know what it is. Like something subtle. You can just tell it wasn't sent by the person that it says it is. Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:48:05       Well you get a sense of someone who they are, when you read just their posts on a message board or you read their Twitter feed, you don't get it all. But if you're reading 140 characters a day, over a long period of time, 140 characters, a tweet rather over a long period of time, you kind of get a sense of the terrain. You kind of get a sense of the way people phrase things and say how angry they are. Oh yeah. That's a big indicator of anger. You could find out some fucked up shit about people just by reading their angry tweets. Yeah. Like what are you getting mad at? Dummy? Yeah. Like Jesus Christ, like this person away from your fucking life

Speaker 4:          01:48:43       and just everything's like, I have to watch myself. I can get bit or, because I think it's funny to write something that, and I'm not really being bitter. It's just like it's the easy path to a laugh better. Yeah. And then I looked back and I go, wow, that was 12 bitter ones in a row. How the fuck do I look right now?

Speaker 1:          01:49:00       I uh, follow several people that I think are idiots and uh, one of the things that I really enjoy following is people that are not very bright, but they give a lot of advice. Yeah. Like people are not very bright, but they're, their Twitter feed is always advice. Like what you need to do in this world is go for your dreams. And like you read their Twitter, you're like, oh, okay. I think it's an insight. It's an insight to like someone's struggling for sanity insight to someone trying to like find, find sense in the world with this doll. Nine volt brain.

Speaker 4:          01:49:35       Yeah, it's def. It's definitely the access to giving people information has outweighed the ability to supply it in an equality way. There's just, there's just like, I even feel it. Like I can't, I can't tweet every day

Speaker 1:          01:49:48       sometimes I just don't really have anything to say. But you know, you feel like I should put something out today and then you write something and you go, what if I could I write that for that was stupid. I liked taking news off of Twitter. I think it's good to do. Yeah. Yeah. Cause I think some days I don't have shit to say. I think taking days off, um, you know, I was talking about this the other day we were, we were talking about stand up in this way, that taking days off standup, taking weeks off, stand up. I think it was Collin was talking to him, we were talking about how if you go and go and go your act, it's really tight. Everything feels really good. But when you take like a week off and then jump back in, the enthusiasm just cranks back up again.

Speaker 1:          01:50:24       You know? I think that's the case with pretty much everything in life. If you do things too much, you'll lose your perspective. Like you lose like what it is about that thing that you really enjoy. Like yeah, you need little breaks. Hey, your bit at big can get a lot stronger when you, when you walk away from it for a little while and you come back and you go, oh, I didn't even get why I wrote that bit. That's, that's what I was originally thinking. It's about this. Yeah. You tighten it up and you realize that like for me, you know, you make a lot of choices throughout a bit. I can go this way or go that way. Sometimes you just get to clarity when you come back to it to see that you were, that that was a, you got a cheap laugh off that one time and you thought that was part of the bet and it wasn't.

Speaker 1:          01:51:04       It was just a, it was a, you got lost for a second. You got to come back? Yeah, I have a bit that I just added to another book that I abandoned years ago. Like I had it and then I lost it. Like I had it for a while. It's like very strong bit and then I fucked something up with it or tweaked it wrong and, and it just got too complicated and I was like, well there's too many jokes similar to that. My, I'll just put aside and I put it aside for years and years. And the other day I was on stage, I was in the middle of one bit and I started thinking about, oh my God, that fits right in there. And like a glove, it just slid into place and crushed. It was like almost like I was holding, it was a wedge that I didn't have a gap for.

Speaker 1:          01:51:45       Yeah. And then all of a sudden, oh it's right there. Yeah. And all its liabilities were out the window. Cause it didn't like it as a standalone bit. It didn't have an ending. It's like, but when I shoved it in the middle of this other bit that already had an ending, he just made that bit way better and you didn't have to work on it and fine tuning it already done that work. It just needed a place. That's why I think standup comedy, like spending time just going over your act is like one of the one things that we all could do more of. I did this thing with Ari where I went over a shiny happy jihad, which was CD I put out in like 86 or something like that or a 2006 rather. And um, when we went over it, we're talking about why you did this, why he did that.

Speaker 1:          01:52:26       And I really hadn't thought about a lot of it and listening to it for the first time in all these years. Like I don't remember the jokes. So like a few of them I remembered, but some of them were really making me laugh. Like I didn't, I never had heard them before. Even though there were mine, you know, I could be completely forgot them and going over it like that, like made me like super fucking to go to stand up and I got on this like real rampage over the next few weeks after that there really helped me and it made me think like, man, that's probably an aspect, um, of comedy that we don't like to do that we probably all should be doing sitting down, going over all of your act, going over to your note, what's going over all the different bits and is this the right order for them? What's a better order? Why don't we try this order tonight? Why don't we try this for the first show and that for the second show. Well that's just nice

Speaker 4:          01:53:11       that when you go to a club and you worked there for three nights as you got two afternoons where you can take your sat and listened to it the next day and think about it and then give yourself some time to write new shit. And you know, you really have nothing to do except focus on your stand up for, you know, two straight days. Then you come back to La and you gotta you go on at the Improv or somewhere and people are like, wow, you got like fucking lot of new material there. That's good. And like you wouldn't have that if you were just working in town.

Speaker 1:          01:53:38       Right. Or if you were, you need to have to be really disciplined. Yeah. Really disciplined to make sure that you're just going up and doing this. Is this 15 minutes is going to be all about blank. Yeah. It's just a fun, fun fucking thing to do, man. Yeah. Still after all these years, people who don't know, we started out together like within a week of each other. Right. That's crazy. Yeah. Dude, we're only shy 25 years old as fuck. Yeah. We're all this shit. Remember when you were a kid and you thought of someone who was 47 you're like, what's Eh, 47 that was beyond marriage. Like Middle Ages, 40 dead man. Yeah. I remember I was in high school and I had a thing for Madonna. I found that Madonna was 26 it's like God damn, that bitch is old. She's 26 good Lord. Yeah. Yeah. I used to like older. I always liked older women. How old?

Speaker 4:          01:54:31       Well, when I was, um, I guess, I guess when I was in like ninth grade, I fooled around with this girl that was a senior, but it was like, you know, she wasn't doing it because she was turned on by me. It was just like I hung around or a lot and she was like, throw me a bone. So she let me see your tits and stuff. But then when I was like 19 I dated a woman who was turning 40 that summer. It was like a whole summer long romance. Whoa. She is this big corporate lawyer. Very successful. And I was living out in the Hamptons with my brother and another guy and like this shitty, it was a one bedroom just flee written. You woke up every day covered in bites and they had a two bedroom next to us, her and her sister.

Speaker 4:          01:55:08       The Palumbo sisters and they would, uh, they had this beautiful two better with like top shelf liquor and they were Italian from queens and so they would, they'd come out and they would cook pasta and chicken cutlets everything all weekend and we would just move over there. My brother was hooking up with one sister and I was hooking up with the other one and then we would just like fuck around and eat and drink and then we'd go dancing with them at night and then they'd leave on Sunday night and they'd give us like all this Tupperware with all the leftovers in it that we'd, we'd survive on for a couple more days. Then they come out on the weekends. Oh, she was the greatest. Wow. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          01:55:44       40. Huh? 40 years old. You were 19. I was 19. How was her body? Good. Good. You know, Italian girls the age, well at Brown skin tight. Was she getting off a big divorce feet? No, she was a workaholic. Thanks. She was know she was a corporate lawyer. She was big time and a lot of money. Was she on top most of the time? Yeah. She took control. Wow. So yeah, she'd ride it. Yes. She'd hold the base and then it was all, it was like hers all up to her. Wow. Standard shift. She fucked you. She fucked me. Whoa. I pushed back and she'd yell at me, Whoa, you don't move. Whoa. You Little Shit. You spit in your mouth. You're in high school. Spit my mouth. Stick her feet and that's where the foot thing, she would stick her feet. Oh, cut. Nah, we allow it to be on top.

Speaker 2:          01:56:34       Oh yeah. No. Look, I was an adult when I was 19 I was an animal. I couldn't be stopped. I just, I just was so horny. I was so horny that when women finally let me start having sex with them, I would ravage them. I would just, I my hands, I was, you wouldn't see me laying with my arms by my side. I didn't care for having sex for an hour. I was still working. I would grab a nipple. Fucking fishhook hands were moving all the time. Can I get one in the asshole that night then? I am. I'm checking. I'm going to check the oil, check it every time. Get Away with here. How far can I push it on every single encounter. That was my emo. Wow. Yeah, you're an animal. Then they stop you when you go. All right. That's the line. We don't cross that till next time we try it again.

Speaker 1:          01:57:20       If you thought about the difference between you as like a 12 year old or 11 year old and then puberty and then riding the furious waves of pure beauty, which is what I call like 16 1718 yeah, like those years, like into 19 even though like by the time you like figure out how to stay on the wave, the wave of hormones that your body starts producing and how different you are, your observations on life are like when you're 10 you don't give a fuck about ass or tits or feet or high heels or the way a girl puts her lipstick on. But when you're 17 you're jerking off to magazines. Like you're taking magazines, you're beaten off on the girls' pictures, on magazines. Like look at naked bodies, you're fading off

Speaker 2:          01:58:03       and all. I can just remember going into a white noise space where nothing else mattered. I was jerking off and the world shut down around me. It was just so intense. It was like, I guess what somebody would feel like if they went in like heroine. Nod. It was so like all encompassing.

Speaker 1:          01:58:23       Yeah, it's a drug. I mean your body's trying to reproduce. Your body's trying to give you all these fucking neuro chemicals. These feel good juices to pump through your body. Serotonin and dopamine and love and oxytocin and calm. Hurry up, calm.

Speaker 6:          01:58:42       Ah Good. We, when we reproduce and the eggs break open, the little kid comes out screaming. You're like, how the fuck? Cause they tricked you with that come juice. That's that feeling that you get when you just, oh, rub my balls. Oh, that's how you make a person that's sweet relief. It's this weird biological trick. Isn't that amazing? It's the most, it's the most intense, incredible thing you do and it's also the most intense, incredible feeling that you're having while you do it. And if you don't smoke pot, you don't even know what sex feels like. You think you do? We'd make sex feel so much better. Hey, what did you think of that article I sent you from the New Yorker about the, isn't that wild? Yeah. Explain what it is. Basically, you know, all the testing that they did on mushrooms and LSD back in the 60s.

Speaker 6:          01:59:32       I mean starting, I think they started and let like the forties right? Well, Gordon Wasson was the guy who originally started bringing mushrooms to the Western world. Who was the one who started, I think it was a life magazine. They publish some shit about him or some shit about, uh, his, uh, his, uh, trials to Mexico's travels to Mexico and his experiments with magic mushrooms. I think that was, I think that was in the 50s yeah. So, so they did all these studies and then obviously the CIA did all the LSD studies and the fifties and sixties, they're mostly fifties, I think. And then all the sudden they outlawed it and they just said, bury that data and it just disappeared. You cannot find any of the testing results that they did from back then. And so they lost a lot of good progress. And so this New Yorker piece is talking about how suddenly scientists are getting the green light from major universities.

Speaker 6:          02:00:24       Harvard and Yale and Boston University are all funding studies to look back into what he called the drug and magic mushrooms, psilocybin, psilocybin. And what they're doing is they're doing control testing, um, and they're giving it to people specifically that have terminal illnesses and helping them deal with the, you know, the, their mortality, literary that they're going to die. And how do you wrap your head around that and how do you deal with the depression that comes with that and they're giving them the mushrooms and they're having, their 70% of them are having mystical experiences like God, like experiences and then they are holding on to it. It doesn't go away. They are walking through the rest of their lives realizing that all is love. They said that's the, the common thread that runs through all of them is that it's all about love. And they get that in their head and they die with it whenever, you know, if they last another year or two years, they don't need another experience on the mushrooms to get back to that place. It stays with them. Well, I think if you were at a real transformative period of your life, I mean that's the biggest transformation ever, right? Going from life to death, the ultimate last trip that we all take, you're probably like super

Speaker 5:          02:01:39       emotional and very engaged and I would imagine that under that kind of stress and that kind of like uncertainty, a mushroom trip would be even more profound. But if you have a, a real powerful psychedelic trip and it doesn't change your, your complete total view of, of reality, he probably just didn't get a high enough dose. That's all it is. I mean, I know I've talked to a lot of people who've done mushrooms and they loved it. They had a great time. They're like, oh my God, we were on the beach. We were so silly. We laugh for hours. It was so beautiful. It was this amazing experience opened me up to the way the world was and made me feel like they probably had that wonderful experience. They really probably did. But the difference between that kind of experience and like what they're giving these people in these, these trials, like you give people like five dried grams of psilocybin mushrooms, that's like a big breakthrough dose and you have this overwhelming like incredible visionary, like transformative experience that most people don't get to.

Speaker 5:          02:02:41       Like the DMT experience is supposedly the most intense that of all the psychedelics at, of all the Wood Mckenna used to call, like the center of the Mandalah. If those all, all, all psychedelic experiences vary, whether it's Payoti or mushrooms or, um, you know, sage, which is, um, um, uh, what is that fucking one that everybody gets at grocery stores? It's still available. Salvia, Salvia divinorum. It's essentially like a sage plant. They all like reach some different psychedelic state. But the center of the Mandala of the craziest one is the dimethyltryptamine experience. And if you have the dimethyltryptamine experience, like I said, it's impossible to look at the rest of reality the same way again because you always know that that's, that's in your head last very, very short. It's only like 15 minutes. No, but I'm saying how long does the effect, it depends on how much you entrench yourself in the the common threads and themes and pathways of everyday life.

Speaker 5:          02:03:41       You can jump right back into everyday life and it doesn't last very long at all. It's like this unbelievably profound loving experience where when it's happening you, you, you just feel overwhelmed first of all by the truth in these entities that you're encountering, like how much they know about you, like how much they know about who you are and then the reality of like that might not even be entities. That might be you. It might be, there are many use that encompass you just like there's billions of eco lie living in your gut. There might be like various streams of consciousness that are almost like entities that exist in your mind at any given time. And you might be tapping into these and turning these two 11 when you're on a psychedelic, it might be what the psychedelic is really doing is introducing you the potential of all the chemicals in your mind if like optimized and it's one brief burst of love and color and and, and just geometric objects, patterns, just representing

Speaker 1:          02:04:38       imagination at its fullest, wild Liz, wildest, most open flower. And then that might be what's happening when you're doing these things. But regardless of what the actual, you know, whether it's both or neither one, the experiences themselves, they changed the way you view the world because you know that that's possible now where you never knew that that was possible. You always felt like everything in my life, you know, if, if I, there was a scale from the worst experiences I've ever had to, the best experiences I've ever had. Everything is sort of categorized. So it was like, well, I know what it's like to be scared. Well, I know what it's like to be in a car accident. Well I know what it's like to get a blow job. I know what it's like to play football. I know, you know, you know you have all these things and you say, well I have a pretty good idea of what life is. And then you take three hits off of this little vaporizer piping

Speaker 3:          02:05:28       and

Speaker 1:          02:05:28       he looks like crackling, like burning plastic and you see this chrysanthemum looking sort of like the flower of life. You know, that flower of life that's described like you, you a, you see it in a lot of like ancient Hindu art. Yeah. It's um, it's a geometric pattern and um, this flower of like you, you see this flower of life, Dmt, DMT. Oh yeah, for sure. Almost everybody sees it or you see some version of it, but the things that are, you're seeing are happening so fast. It's so diff in, they're all, they're never the same thing. Look, you look at something and they become something else. Like instantly, constantly, always changing. So you never can really lock onto anything. Everything is constantly moving and morphing and looking at you. And sometimes he's like gestures and they're giving you the finger. And then they disappeared, which won behind these fractal psych clones of geometric patterns.

Speaker 1:          02:06:19       It turn it into flowers that turn into grass. They turn it to babies coming out of vaginas that turning to you, they're turning to handshakes and hugs and love. And it is insane. And it happens for about 15 minutes. And when it's over, just knowing that that can ever happen. Yeah, it's just a matter of whether or not you remember it. Well, they said also it, it deals with depression. It helps people with depression a lot. And I think it's maybe that when you're depressed for long enough, you literally forget what it feels like to feel good. And I think that by giving you that intense of a good positive experience, it makes you go, Oh yeah, I'm supposed to try. I'm supposed to, you know, achieve that in whatever means I can, you know, whether it's exercise or you know, sex or whatever it is that you've just stopped doing because you're so depressed, it gives you the inspiration to try to get back there. Yeah. And it also, it's like a really intense form of love. You know, that's a weird way to describe it. But the psychedelic experiences make you feel loved, not to everybody. And obviously, I mean, you have to Redo it and do it. Cause some people have mental issues. Some people, regular reality is slippery already. Yeah. They probably shouldn't be doing anything right. But the people that do do it, that are in a good place when they wind up doing it oftentimes experiences like profound sense of being loved. How is it who

Speaker 5:          02:07:35       you do it with? Very important set. That's what it said in this is they have people that walk you through it, that are professionals at guiding you through this kind of experience. Yeah. That's super, super, super important. Um, uh, like a lot of those indigenous tribes that do these a shamonic rituals, they have like very like rigid sort of ideas of like, this is what we do. We sit down and we're all going to like, you know, we're all going to talk, we're all going to drink this liquid and this guy's gonna blow tobacco. Small can play the drums. And it's like slowly going to come on. And it's like orchestrated. Like they're, they're setting this up and this guy's going to sing. And these guys will sing these things called eco rows. And these eco rows are these songs that they sing that accompany the DMT experience.

Speaker 5:          02:08:21       So when you, when you smoked DMT and you listen to these songs, you see these things dancing, like as they're like, I'll play it for you. I've played it on the podcast whores. Now, if some of these native places to take the, uh, others, a lot of parents, there's a lot of them, dude, oh, I cut into my phone. There's a lot of these fucking tours. They're doing it all over the place and they're doing it. You know, some of them it's not good to because there's going to be people that are capitalizing on those situations where, you know, they, they're just profiting. Of course selling cell phones, recording it. Yeah. Yeah. I got it right there. Oh, it plug it in. No, I'll just play it on the, the, the thing here. But um, I think that uh, it should all be legal. I think you should be able to do whatever you want to do as far as a, you want to, if you want to run around and you want to have a good time and do mushrooms or drink whiskey or you know, whatever it is, whether it will scare you used to be, I'm sorry, I was going to say, but when you see these studies coming out about the benefits of it, you just, it makes you feel bad that all these people were kept from that for so many decades that like there's a lot of people over from 1970 when they made mushrooms illegal and Lsd and pretty much everything to 2014 that's horrible.

Speaker 5:          02:09:41       That's 44 45 years. While these really beneficial plants have been illegal and for no fucking reason, there's no reason that makes any sense. Yeah. It's um, man, it was, it was the Rockefeller laws, right? Is that what the someone, someone, I don't know who was responsible for it all, but there was this sweeping illegalization or sweeping prohibition act that covered shit. That's not even psychoactive. There's like they just started marking things illegal like a bunch of, they didn't know exactly what was legal, what wasn't legal, but they lumped shit in like everything that was scheduled one, there's all nontoxic nonlethal drugs that are scheduled. One, like a giant percentage of them, which is crazy because that just shows you, this is a giant problem with the way they're classifying drugs still in 2015 marijuana

Speaker 1:          02:10:34       federally is still a schedule. Right, right, right. It's fucking same as currently. Ridiculous. Same as, yes. Same as cocaine. Well cocaine and then heroin is scheduled to write because I think they have medicinal uses, you know, because opiates they use for painkillers and there's medical cocaine. Oh, I'm going to make sure that I'm right about that cause I think they might've changed.

Speaker 4:          02:10:57       Well that was the whole thing that uh, black people feel like is that, why is it the crack is schedule one and cocaine because crack is for black people and cocaine is for white people as the, uh, the interpretation,

Speaker 1:          02:11:10       which is unbelievably racist. Yeah, right. There's the issue. It's heroin is one. It used to be two, I believe. Now it's one and coke is still too, which is fucking bananas. But look, psilocybin, psilocybin and LSD and masculine. Jesus, is there a danger with the psilocybin? No, you can't freak out on it. Yeah, you could definitely freak out, but you come back. Well, hopefully. So there is a boss. If you get that close to the abyss, I mean the experiences that you have in those things, if you have a weak heart, it would probably be incredibly taxing because a lot of people feel like they're going to die. They relive their entire life. They look at themselves through this really intense introspective vision that freaks him out. You know, the, the, the harsh introspective aspects of a lot of these psychedelics really bother some people. And if you're like barely hanging on, if you're, you're like on the verge of a heart attack, it could push you over the top Adderalls schedule too. I used to take that shit. Well that's legal now. All that shit they could prescribe. Look at all that stuff. There's a lot of stuff.

Speaker 4:          02:12:15       Yeah, there's a lot of drugs up there. Look at all those drugs. They were, they did a special on 60 minutes last night about, um, that they, they think they have a cure for the, uh, uh, Ebola virus. It, I mean, it worked. They only had like seven batches of it and they gave it to seven people and they were all cured, but that they, Dave knew about it since the 70s, but it's taken them this many years to develop it because none of the pharmaceutical companies can make a profit off of it because the government wasn't buying it. They weren't really, you know, actively, you know, they, they were looking for a cure, but not really putting any money behind it. And so, but in order to make this cure that you have to like take fucking thousands of acres of this special kind of tobacco and uh, they have to soak it in this chemical and all to come up with like a dozen doses. Wow. It's crazy.

Speaker 1:          02:13:09       That's so strange when, when you think about what these indigenous tribes have been able to do with these plants, that's when it gets really strange. Think about the fact that they've figured out like a big percentage of the pharmaceutical drugs that we use today. Big percentage of them come from like rainforests. They find these plants how they fund a lot of play. Like they're constantly searching the rain forest for different properties of plants. They think that one day they're gonna come up with some plant that cures cancer. They're going to find it in the Amazon. They use him for a lot of different purposes, which is, you know, weird. These people figured out some of them on their own, you know, the Iowasca thing, they figured that thing on their own. They figured out how to blend plants and make a drug out of it. Like they figured out how to boil it and the whole thing. They use a pot and they boil it and it takes hours. Yeah. They all figured out a way how to do this, which is

Speaker 6:          02:13:58       just lot of trial and error. A lot of stuff. They tried to, somebody died from and they went well, shut that one off. Like the, the knowledge of what you can eat and your neighborhood. Yeah. Fucking super important. Yeah. The Wong, the wrong little stripe on a frog and you're dead. You know the wrong little, you know, little spot on a bug. Yeah. It can kill you. Knowing how to plant the seeds in a way that makes them grow correctly and had a burn out the forest when it needs to be burned out. How's just in Yellowstone and there were tears talking about how that, you know, that the native people used to set fires, they just, they knew the schedule to rotate, burning the FTF forest out so that they can get super fires.

Speaker 9:          02:14:41       And I did the ashes. Where was that? It? Yeah, it was the sound that you listened to and you're fucked up on DMT. I wish I could describe what it looks like, but you see the song when you're, when you're under the aim for once you actually see it, like the song takes place in three dimensional form that gives a dancing thing. It's not just a sound, it becomes like a dancing object to your mind transforms the trip. And do people describe it similarly? But they say, yeah, but it's,

Speaker 1:          02:15:21       it's hard to describe. So I think they're saying something similar, but there's no real words for it. Like the, like everything that I've said, the way I described it is really shitty. It's like that you can't really do it or you don't, there's no context for the experience. The experience is so weird. There's no context for it. So it doesn't, it like if you described it and I listened to your description, I'm like, I guess we were in the same place, but it's not like, yeah, there was this tree, you remember there was a tree and had a broken branch and it laid over it. Oh yeah, I remember that. It was right near the fountain. Yes. And it's not like that. Like you would be describing it to me. I'd be like, okay, maybe complex geometric patterns floating in and out of existence. Constantly morphing in front of you.

Speaker 1:          02:16:02       It's all love and understand. I guess. I guess you were at the same spot, you know, is there a seven 11? What did smell like? It smell like Bumpus yes. Bump this. Oh we were in the same spot. Yeah. You know, you could talk about like, oh I went to the ski lodge. You know, you walk in, there's a big moose in the wall. Oh yeah. Yeah. I've been out of spot. You say, you know all we did LSD. What was it like? Oh it's just, I spend an hour staring in the mirror and uh, I watched my entire life from birth to that moment on fast forward. Yeah. Okay.

Speaker 4:          02:16:36       That's it. Cause you're not going to jot it down while you're doing it. It'd be great if they come up to technology where they can videotape what you're imagination is going through while you're tripping on something. And then show it and major theaters around the country.

Speaker 1:          02:16:48       That's one of the things that someone in mind, they've been, Mckenna again was speculating that one of the best ways to deliver, um, a psychedelic trip to someone was with virtual reality and figuring out a way through like CGI imagery to reproduce the effects of the trip. Like the, the reproduce what you're saying. Yeah. If they could get the technology to that point where they could, someone could go to trip, you know, do mushrooms or do DMT trip and then figure out a way to reproduce that.

Speaker 4:          02:17:21       Then you would take the drugs out. Somebody could just watch the trip and feel the trip. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          02:17:26       Yeah. That it could be possible that it could be done that way. He was, it was totally believing it can be done that way because there's people that said they could do it with yoga man. There's people that say they can have full blown psychedelic experiences. She'll loosen nations, visuals, transport it to the center of the universe and dancing with angels the whole deal. And they do it all through yoga.

Speaker 4:          02:17:45       Yeah. Yeah. I know with meditation they, certain levels you can get to. I mean, I do very basic TM. I've been doing it for like six months, but I do it twice a day. Yeah. What made you start? Um, everybody I've talked to that had done it had a profound experience with it. You know, their lives are better. You know, you guys like, you know, Seinfeld, it's done it forever. And um, a lot of comics that, uh, that I like, we're doing it. What do you do? It's really simple. It's a very unguided meditation. You just kind of sit in a comfortable place. They give you a mantra that you do and you're not tied to the match. You're not like repeating it over and over again. And that's all you think about. It's more of like, it kind of leads you, um, it's sort of the way they describe it as.

Speaker 4:          02:18:26       It's almost like it's off in the distance and you can hear it, but you're not, it's not your whole focus. And then your brain can go wherever it's going to go. You can go into little daydreams and then you can gently notice that and pull yourself back to the mantra and do that. And you just let yourself go with it. And it's very nonjudgmental. You don't ever judge where your mind went. You don't snap yourself self back to it. And then, uh, and then it ends, it feels like it feels like five, 10 minutes and 20 minutes ends. I set my alarm and then you just feel totally rested and centered and stress is gone. And like my baseline of depression has been so much higher since I started.

Speaker 1:          02:19:05       You mean the baseline? Meaning like,

Speaker 4:          02:19:08       like I get depression and this helped me a lot.

Speaker 1:          02:19:12       Oh, so you're not saying let like the Depression is higher

Speaker 4:          02:19:15       now? I would say that the bad, the bad part of the depression, the level is higher. Right.

Speaker 1:          02:19:20       Um, that's, that's really fascinating. And what is the mantra? Like, what'd you say?

Speaker 4:          02:19:25       Well, they give each person a different one. I, I'm, there's x number of mantras. I don't know how many there are, but they assigned them to you. Like what? Give me an example of what a macho like ohm is like the classic mantra. So it doesn't have to be a word. It could be like, oh, it's a sound. It's always a song. Yeah. So He'd just sit there and make the Sanskrit. So it's different. Sanskrit sounds

Speaker 1:          02:19:45       TM is t like transcendental meditation is all Sanskrit. Right? Wow. And so just sitting there going home.

Speaker 4:          02:19:52       Well we know it's all, you don't say it, you don't verbalize it in your mind and your mind, you do it. But it does have a resonant sound because they see even mentally there's some kind of reverberation that goes on.

Speaker 1:          02:20:02       So this just doing this has raised like whatever depression that you do get, it takes a longer time to come on and it's, it's less impact.

Speaker 4:          02:20:10       It doesn't stay, it doesn't stay. And I don't go down as far as I did. And that's probably the chief reason I started is that I'd read a lot about it and it said that that's one of the main things, you know, anxiety and depression can be tied hand in hand. I don't expect, I don't think I experience anxiety as much as just, you know, my family has depression. My, you know, everybody in my family's got it. And it's just something that, you know, you can, you can medicate it, you can exercise it out or you can, you know, there's a lot of different ways to go at it.

Speaker 1:          02:20:38       That's a weird way, um, that we have to regulate the minds like to manage the mind, but just taking a thing like a, a sound and rolling it over in your mind over and over and over again. And it's almost like a cycle, like a cleaning cycle.

Speaker 4:          02:20:53       Yeah. It's like stopping the cycle at stopping the cycle of thoughts that are nonstop in your mind. It gives you a break. It's almost like, it's like doing a cleanse. It gives your stomach and you're calling it a chance to clean itself. So twice a day you're stopping that site. And that's the thing that I find with it is that I get bored of the cycle. Like if I'm going through my day, I'm having a cycle of thoughts like anybody does. And you don't notice that it's a cycle until you stop and it's all that's in your mind and then you go, oh, you're fucking, that's boring. We've already thought that you kind of let it go and it goes away.

Speaker 1:          02:21:28       That's that. I liked that idea of a cleaning cycle like you, you introduced like a cleaning agent for 20 minutes and you a nip all the buds and parcel the problems and settle it all down. That make sense? Because me and my worst in my life, the one I've felt most out of control and my wife are doing the wrong shit or you know least in control of my emotions. I've always felt like I was on like too much momentum. Like I couldn't stop. Like I was like the, the momentum of all my past acts was like overwhelming me and I was just running to keep from getting run over and like something like TM or for me it became a martial arts and then later the tank, the tank helps a lot to just get into that space where you just let it all go.

Speaker 1:          02:22:18       And once you do let it all go, you could start fresh. Right. But when you don't get a chance to do that, it seems like you're constantly dealing with this phone. What's connected to that thing that you got to take care of you. You didn't clean out that thing and fucking this guy wants to meet you because you're supposed to do that thing and it's all done. It all builds up to the point where you're, the anxiety is oftentimes just the data, the sheer data that you're dealing with every day in life. Whether it's emotional shit, whether it's memory shit, we, it's work related shit or family related shit. It's like fuck.

Speaker 4:          02:22:45       And your thoughts all go to, they all go back to, I mean not to be Friday in, cause I'm, I, I'm not Freudian, but there are, there are aberrations in your thoughts in terms of how we perceive ourselves and what external events, how we identify ourselves based on external events. Like, I didn't get this job. That means, well you can, you can control what that means is ways of having, you know, cognitive changes where you stop yourself from thinking what you thought from being a child and having a father that beat you or even something more subtle, you know, things that affected over time, the way you connected external events to how you felt about yourself. And you can go in and you can just buy by repeating, you know, no, that doesn't mean that, you know, that just means that this, this happened like power of now. It's like you don't, you don't, uh, you know, a thought is not a reality. It's just something that is flowing through you and you can notice it and you can comment on it without internalizing it and going for the full ride.

Speaker 1:          02:23:47       They say that's one of the things that people have the hardest time with when it comes to, uh, suffers. People that are trying to overcome the abusive they have when their a childhood that when they were in childhood because that abuse oftentimes like defines them. They feel like they're a shitty person for have been being abused. You're damaged because you've been abused and you'd just sort of define yourself by this abuse that you've suffered. Yeah. Where you can't look at the bright side of things like you, you look like it's always bad. Things are always going to happen to you. It's like if you've defined yourself in some way because of the abusive side.

Speaker 4:          02:24:21       Oh, you even caused the abuse because you're bad, right? Yeah. You could have, there was a reason why I was beat. It's my fault. So then when anything bad happens in your life, you go back to thinking you caused it.

Speaker 1:          02:24:32       It makes you think if this psychedelic Lez legislation of the 1970s if it never had been passed and if these 35 years since that happened, if people had been allowed to explore these things and come to these conclusions and try to figure out like what, what are, what are the beneficial aspects of the way we behave and the way we think and the way we sort of qualify and quantify life's meaning, whether it's financial or whether it's family, like what did what, what, what's really smart about this and how much more could we have done if people were doing mushrooms, doing acid. So much more thinking would have taken place on these really people could say they're frivolous, there's just, these are distractions, but they're not, you know, these are, these are these ideas and concepts that you develop when you're either doing psychedelics or meditating, anything where you're involved in sort of an active assessment and resetting of your consciousness, whether it's yoga, meditation, whatever the fuck it is, tanks, size, isolation tanks. We will you doing is you're allowing yourself time to reflect on what you're doing and whether or not it's beneficial and what can be changed. And if you don't have that reflection time, you oftentimes don't change unless you fall completely apart and you're forced to change. Yeah. That happens. A lot of people they have, that's what they always say about drug addicts. They have to hit rock.

Speaker 4:          02:25:54       I forgot to hit bottom mean anything gambling, you know, and you were always shocked by people's bottoms. Like, you know, you look at somebody who just keeps fucking up like, you know, Brittany Spears when she was really going down the rails, it was like, hasn't she hit bottom yet? No, not even close. Yeah. And then there's other people like me, I had a pretty shallow bottom. I quit drinking when I was like, I dunno, 24. And uh, I started drinking when I was probably 12. So I drank for, you know, a decent period of time, but like I wasn't blowing guys for a sandwich. I was just feeling like it was controlling my life. I was feeling like this is something I'm going to when I'm feeling sad or I'm going to when I'm feeling stressed or would a was definitely the relationship to alcohol I had was bad cause my father was an alcoholic, you know, he died at 51 and so I just knew I didn't want to go down that path.

Speaker 4:          02:26:45       So I had what you'd call a shallow bottom. But you know, just to see other people where it just can get, it can get so extreme. But that's the only time you really change. And so for me, I think changing it with a shallow bottom meant that there was so much more baggage that went with it. You know, that, that I was bottoming out with feeling that I was dependent on something and I wasn't, I couldn't be myself fully because there was a part of my psyche that was locked up in this thing and that was enough for me to go, I got to change. I don't want to live my life like that.

Speaker 1:          02:27:16       You did a young man, I remember when you did it. I remember it because I remember you were almost like, like you had remorse, you know, that you had to do this. Like I felt like there was almost a sadness about you, about the having it like, fuck yeah, I can't do this. I just can't do it. I'm sorry I'm going to miss it. But it's over. Yeah. And you just, you just stopped. You know, you didn't have to fucking join a what? All these other comics. There's a million comics that were in a, and they were all like, they had this like real weird preachy thing about them too. They look at, you drink in the chick there had, they were really annoying. You know, you didn't do that. He just stopped drinking. You stopped.

Speaker 4:          02:27:57       Yeah. And it's, it's, it's funny because Boston Aa in Boston is a very intense thing because the city with the same power they drank with, they got sober with, you know, they would rage with sobriety. Yeah. And you know, and look, God bless him, the people that used it and it worked for them, that's fantastic. But for some of them it became like two meetings day and you know, you've got three sponsors and you, and it's like, you know, that's great, but uh, you know, move, move

Speaker 6:          02:28:22       along a little bit here. You get a little caught up in this thing. Well, it becomes their culture. Yeah. The culture of sober people. Yeah. That's a big culture. A strong culture. Yeah. And if sy, again, like for some people it's life or death. It literally is, those are the stakes with the meetings. Oh yeah, man. And also it's a good launching pad for a lot of comics. Oh yeah. Get up and do those meetings. He tells hilarious stories, wicking up shit face stuffed into a laundry machine and you know, they have these ridiculous shit, their pants stories as crowd of all time. They're all sober, they're jacked up on coffee. They love it. And they know what the fuck you're talking about. Yeah. You know, they're having a good time. I remember going to some, they was just saying, I think it was called like Miskiw par.

Speaker 6:          02:29:02       I don't know why I remember that. But it was in Worcester and the Aa community gets together and they do these conventions where they had like, you know, a thousand people coming from all over New England staying in his hotel and just having meetings. You know, the 9:00 AM there's a 1212 o'clock step meeting and they'd all go and apparently everybody's fucking everybody because they got all this energy to channel and burn off and so it was just hypersexual obviously very social. I mean, what's more social then you sit down in a meeting and the person next to you go, how you doing? 12 years sober. Hey, are you doing, I'm great. 10 years. Bula he did. Somebody does a motivational talk. You clap, you laugh, everybody has a coffee halfway through. What a fucking great way to meet people and now you're just like you normally you would go get drunk and pass out and instead you're awake and jacked up on coffee and you all have something in common.

Speaker 6:          02:29:54       Yeah. Talk about your sobriety, where you're fuck drunk with your cock. People love little groups. Yeah. Part of a nice little group that everybody else is trying to run marathons are marathon runners group together? Yeah. Oh, we're all owners of Dotson's. We're going to get our dots. It's all a little doggies. Look, your bull Godson, they meant Dotson's cause it's fairly group people that own dogs or those old to 40 zs. That shit. Yup. I was a little Japanese sports cars. Those were fucking bad ass. But those little groups of people, man, no matter what it is, they just, people love being dug by. You ever go with dog park? But he's shitting me. Same people every day. And you know what they talk about why they hang out? Dogs. That's all they talk about. Oh, I got a Corgi. Mine's half Corgi. Half Poodle. So it's a cook.

Speaker 6:          02:30:44       She is such a Pomeranian. Let me tell you, she's such a Pomeranian. Sometimes she looks in the mirror and she thinks this is another Pomeranian she barks. It's adorable. But she's protective. I mean you look at the size of her, you wouldn't think she protects. Oh, she becomes an animal, becomes a bear. You'd be able to hear that. Did you ever see best in show? Oh yeah. That was great. Amazing. It was awesome. Nailed it. They nailed that culture and they didn't know a subtle enough way, so it was just ridiculous enough where you want that would never happen like you go. That could fucking totally, yeah. Yeah. Those people, that people that are really in then no matter what

Speaker 1:          02:31:20       it is, it's always funny. Yeah. I mean even the US, like the way we talk about comedy, I'm sure people think

Speaker 4:          02:31:25       it's hilarious. Yeah. You got to have something because, and I think as you get older, the more you want, cause I think you, you don't realize when you're young and having a shared history about something is going to be so important than the nostalgia of it. They, the, the self identity of it. And so as you get older all sudden, like you got guys, now they're, you know, just rejoicing in the fact that they're geeks, that they all watched star wars when they were kids and now they get together and they talk about it. When they were watching star wars as a kid, they felt like a fucking gig and they weren't necessarily sharing it with anybody. They were quietly watching it again and again and then crying in their father's basement. You know, there wasn't like a solidarity about it.

Speaker 1:          02:32:01       No. And you remember when, um, like comic books used to be like for losers? Yeah. Like when I got rid of my comic books, I'm over the girls. Danny was like, good, why do you need, um, why'd you have, I'm still here 21. I'm like, I only got rid of him cause I'm fucking broke. I sold them to eat, I missed them, I missed all of them. I collect those for a long fucking time and I sold them for like no money and I remember what it was, but I had like these boxes, you know, I had like three or four boxes fill with comics that I'd collected from the time I was like 15, no Shim. It probably even the earlier, no way earlier because I had a couple of them from the time I was like 12 that I, I really started collecting when I moved to Boston.

Speaker 1:          02:32:42       But before that, I guess I had someone San Francisco too, but the point being I'd have, I'd have him for a good chunk of my life and I would open the plastic bags and pull out the fucking hulk and we like different episodes that were like valuable. This one's worth five bucks. Right? You know, like old x men and punishers and I love those fucking things. But you were taught that you were like a loser, like you're clinging on to some childhood stupidity. Now they have comic con and a million people fly from all over the country to hang out in San Diego and they all wear costumes and shit.

Speaker 4:          02:33:15       I noticed those magazines would be worth a lot of money right now, probably high it. I had all the mad magazine starting in 1975 I had a subscription all the way through pro. I'm probably like three, four, five years and I had them all. And then my mom just tossed mall out while I was in college,

Speaker 1:          02:33:32       cleaned out the attic. Gotcha.

Speaker 4:          02:33:33       Devastating. Cause it's like you, I used to actually go back and read them. I thought they were hilarious.

Speaker 1:          02:33:37       Those old mad magazines were fucking brilliant. Yeah, those were good. My parents bought those when I was a little kid. I used to read them in a toilet. They used to, you know what else they had? Our crumb, my Stepdad was into our crop. Oh Shit. Yeah. You ever read yes. Comics. Yeah. I've read that in the fabulous freak brothers. My stepdad's a hippie and uh, when I was like seven, eight years old when we all started living together because it was like seven, uh, I got introduced to this weird kind of comic books. They would leave in the bathroom, the fabulous freak brothers and the San Francisco. Yeah. Yeah. That's what I was living in San Francisco from like seven to 11. No, but I mean, I think the artists there that San Francisco, right? Was He

Speaker 6:          02:34:18       out right? Yeah. Archroma San Francisco. That a documentary. Yeah. Yeah. Really cool. He was a weird model. Still is a weird motherfucker. Yeah. Wow. He lives in France and he moved to Paris or something, but as images, like he would draw these women with these ridiculous enormous acids and like men would be riding them and shit. It was just very strange fetish and like seeing that as like a little boy. I remember thinking like, why, who is this weird fucking kind? Why is he drawing these people like this? Yeah. Yeah. The fabulous freak brothers was a big one. Like there's all that, there were a lot of like hippie comic strips, all black and white comic books that were sort of designed for adults. It was very strange stuff. He, yeah, it was very, uh, it was very, like, you could call it perverted, but it was actually just really raw.

Speaker 6:          02:35:07       It's like, it was like, it wasn't dirty. It was just graphic. Yeah. It was just like, and, and resonated. It seemed kind of honest like watching this weird fucking guy with glasses are crumb like his version of himself that would do like riding on top of these women that with z enormous asses and high heels and they, it was very strange, but you could tell like for him this is like this wild fantasy. I got to see that movie again. It was really good shit insight into, you know, a really extremely creative artists and all that weird demons that, that flow through his brain that may come or, or angels, whatever it is, make him create his very strange art. Trying to think if there's anything like that today. I mean there's, there's all this cartoon is like adult swim kind of cartoons that are a little offbeat, but they're nowhere near as Ra's this stuff.

Speaker 6:          02:35:57       And I think that if you did it today, you'd be accused of being massaged. Oh yeah, no, his stuff was definitely had reached, you know, a lot of racist overtones, but it was, that's what I mean by it was raw. It was honest. It was like, no, this is how this guy thinks he's writing. There's something that you could appreciate about this guy is unadulterated putting his thoughts on, on paper. Yeah. Let's Google our Crum racism and then look at this. Bam. Oh yeah, yeah. I mean he's doing total blackface images like Jesus Christ, but he was like a hero of the counter culture at the time. Oh yeah. Like he did a lot of like, oh my God, look at this one. Shit. I mean, these are really fucking racist man. Holy Shit. But they had a sense of humor to them that you had to be, you had to be in on the joke. I guess if you just looked at it from the outside, he would just be like, what the fuck? Kind of hate mail is this. Wow, this is weird. This is weird to see. I had forgotten how racist some of the shit was and how weird some of it was. Like there's him and this woman with these enormous horse like legs, like there was so exaggerated the size of their asses and legs. He was the first big ass

Speaker 1:          02:37:16       guy way before j Lo way before any, any of these people. He was like the first, he was like really into giant asses, but he also had like really cool like political shit, you know? He had like, here's one of him riding a woman. Look through that. How strange that at the legs? Yeah. Yeah. He would ride these women that were in cutoff jeans. Jesus Christ. This is a famous one. The True Amazon low center of gravity wide hips strong back. He like had these weird fetishes about thick, powerful women that he would ride.

Speaker 6:          02:38:00       What did we to sex life wise you think he was, he must've been paid prostitutes. Uh Damn. Well who knows? I wonder if

Speaker 1:          02:38:06       tell us he was to get them on your podcast. Yeah, I bet he doesn't do podcasts. I mean, I don't know where even is. I think he is in France or you think he's on Twitter? I'm going to say no.

Speaker 6:          02:38:21       I'm going to say that if you got in touch with him and you said, I'll come to you. I want to talk to you. I'm a big fan. He wouldn't give a shit if it was a podcast, whatever. I bet you that guy would sit down with you. Really? Yeah. That's my guess.

Speaker 1:          02:38:33       I would say just the opposite. I'd say he's just some fucking weird guy likes to hide from people, but I might be wrong. I mean one way, just signed down. I think you'd be kind of introverted. Some of it is her drawing a blank with Robert Crumb's, a guardian article. Some of his work is pretty striking, but he's hardly worthy of his current status is God of the literary underground. Wow. Is it? People are upset.

Speaker 6:          02:38:55       I wrote, my sister used to work at an art gallery in New York, the Alexander Gallery, and they had an art crime exhibit and I remember asking her and she said, no, he didn't come. He was a huge like month long exhibit. Yeah. He probably doesn't want to deal with all the weirdness that he must get from these kind of strange images. If you're, most of the images are like women with big giant acids and huge legs, tree trunk legs, and a lot of them have dudes riding these women like people would get upset at you. Those would be uncomfortable moments by you making me look at this. What is this? What is the obsession with women with giant ankles? I think they put him, I think they used to put them in pen house.

Speaker 1:          02:39:33       Really? I think so. Hmm. This is really interesting. Keep on trucking. That was his shit. Yeah. Yeah. I mean he was like a part of that weird hippie sub culture of like the late sixties and the 70s. It's a strange time to be alive, man. These are the first people that were really kind of, uh, experimenting with Lsd and cannabis was like, oh my God, some of these are so racist. I can't even look at them anymore. I am upset. Craig foot sevens. I literally can't look at them. I'm looking at the penthouse.

Speaker 6:          02:40:05       Yeah. One I would have around, uh,

Speaker 1:          02:40:09       the house with the kids. Well, I think people now they look at the content of it, that kind of what that guardian article was about. They're like, Hey, yeah, this guy was kind of fucked up. Like why are we making them out to be this amazing artist? But it is amazing art because it does something to you. It gives you this reaction, you know, it's, is it necessarily all good now? But it's, it's art. Like this is a very, this is a very unique individual viewpoint. Like this is this guy's viewpoint and that's, that is art. You might not like it, you might be weirded out by it, but it takes weird people to make shit that strikes you. And the way that this guy's work strikes people.

Speaker 4:          02:40:43       Well, arts turned into something that people are supposed to agree with and, and you know, and it's supposed to not offend anybody and that's the opposite. Art's supposed to shake it up. It's supposed to challenge, I mean, you think about punk rock and now it's almost like folksy when you think about old punk rock. Yeah, they have a Mohawk and they peer stuff and they jump up and down. But when it came out, it was anarchy. It was at a time, you know, when it came out in London, it was about, you know, there were, there were strikes going on at the time and there was riots going on in the street and you know, punk rock represented something that was really fucking scary to the status quo.

Speaker 1:          02:41:18       Yeah. It wasn't just your mom won't buy you a car and now they called Green Day punk rock. It's like, are you fucking kidding me? When Green Day was shitting on Justin Bieber, we're not fucking Justin Bieber. It was like, Oh God.

Speaker 4:          02:41:30       Oh, did they say if you have to say that you're not punk rock?

Speaker 1:          02:41:34       Yeah. I mean, there was something where they're getting them off stage early. Do remember that Jamie? Yeah. He freaked out and he said, we're not fucking Justin Bieber. I think he probably apologized to Justin Bieber after that. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          02:41:44       I, no offense, like green day's a great band, but they're not punk rock.

Speaker 1:          02:41:48       Yeah, they're okay. They're an okay pop band pop band. Yeah. It's not, it's not my style, but they have some songs that I like. Sure. Yeah. If I hear them, I think they're enjoyable. Right. But it's not like this is like our chrome was like really essentially like punk rock comic books. He, a lot of the racist stuff that he did, he wasn't necessarily being racist as he was highlighting like how a racist would view something and doing it in a very shocking way. Like I don't think there can be a, I don't think I've ever read anything. I might be wrong, but I don't think I've read it. Ever read anything that indicated that he was actually racist?

Speaker 4:          02:42:28       No. No, I don't think so. I think he was actually a big liberal. I think, you know he lived in San Francisco, I believe. Yeah. But I think it was a lot to do with just being a boy expressing himself. He was, he kind of had arrested development and he was in the same way that when I was 12 years old, the pictures that I would make would probably be in the wheelhouse of the shit that he was making. He just made it much better. And he did it as a man, but to, but to put big pussy lips and nipples that are, you know, four inches long. Like that's what you used to write. He's, I think he was just expressing that.

Speaker 1:          02:42:59       Yeah. Well also I guess what he was doing, um, with a lot of his images there, they were racist pop culture images from the 1940s so he was reviving this very type of imagery

Speaker 5:          02:43:12       that was really racist. And so the real question, the argument in this article on a hood, you tell it, who did, who did utilitarian.com um, the argument was whether or not it was ironic and or parody and like, whether it's enough to absolve him of doing, you know, these images of re reenacting them or recreating them. Hmm. It's interesting. It's interesting because it's kind of, it's revealing like a very specific style of racist cartoons that they used to do. And in doing so, he's like, you know, he's highlighting it is showing you like, hey, like this is, if you're normal and if you're a reasonable person who, who's not racist, you're not going to get racist feelings from looking at this. What you're going to do is you're going to say, wow, this was like how people who are racist think it's not gonna make you raise.

Speaker 5:          02:44:08       You look at like a, you know, chaplain was doing Hitler, you know, f troop. You know, you're, you're depicting the Holocaust. Yeah. In a way that brings some humor to it and brings a different angle to it now. And he brought, he had humor in his pictures. Yeah. You don't become racist by looking at racist shit. Right. The idea is effecting developmenting, developing minds, developing personalities, children, adolescents, like showing them racist stuff and let him know it's okay that can plant racist seeds. But once you're an adult, like no one's gonna, no one's gonna like make you racist. Like if you're Greg Fitzsimmons in 2015 and you see some, some fucking ridiculous racist, racist imagery, you're not going to automatically become racist. Right. So the real concern is like, are we protecting people from these hat tire images because we're worried about the impact of them or because it's offensive, it's offensive to some people and it's only going to be offensive to some people until things even out.

Speaker 5:          02:45:04       Like if you do ridiculous racist versions of white people, I think it's hilarious. And I'm white. You know why? Because white people were ahead of the curve and if it evens out to the point where black people and white people and Chinese people and everybody on such a fucking even ground and that racism is completely preposterous, but the racial differences of each nationality is allowed to be highlighted in brutal fashion and nobody cares. Yeah. Like if you like Richard Pryor sold to white people, the idea of mocking white people, hey there fella. You know the white motherfuckers at work would, you know, like, and we laughed. Your Mama Bitch, my mom was a great old cow. Yeah. You know, like you could white people never got offended by that. Oh, never. Never. It's like awe. Very cute. But there's a lot of jokes like you're not even allowed to joke about certain people on stage, like at all. Like any joke about them is racist, this is racist or homophobic or it's whatever, fill in the blank and that's ridiculous. Like that's ridiculous. Like the joke about Rosa parks and they got a lot of shit about

Speaker 2:          02:46:10       it. Someone a joke, whatever it was. Yeah. They something like he was, she was just to tie, she was too lazy to move to the back of the bus or something like that and it was like a fucking blew up. It was a black comic. Hmm. I don't know if it's cat willy. Nah, it wasn't Katt Williams, but it's a, would it be, what do you think about Leslie Jones? What's he's doing fucking great. She's just a, she's going to be in the new Ghostbusters movie. Who's Leslie Jones? You know her from the comment? Oh, you know what? She probably left the Commie. Still refer you came back. She's black chick. She's tall. She opened for a cat. Williams for you?

Speaker 6:          02:46:44       She's a killer. Okay. I don't know her. She's really, I've seen her on TV one.

Speaker 2:          02:46:50       She's, she's a big funny, great check and she's a, she struggled for fucking 1520 years doing standup, I dunno. 15 years maybe. Good for her. And then she got, she got an a on SNL and she's just blowing up on SNL and that's just got Ghostbusters.

Speaker 6:          02:47:08       Wow. Ghostbusters with all checks. Is that what it is? Yes. Oh, cast. Okay, good luck with that. Yeah, that's going to be a different angle on that new new remakes of movies. There's just, it's hard to get behind these remakes of movies. It's like, you know, and we're going to flip the switch. We're going to do Cagney and Lacey with gay men. Yeah, yeah. We're going to do, you know, not Cagney and Lacey. What was the one where they went off the fucking dumb and Louise, they read the film and Louise, the gay man. No, no.

Speaker 6:          02:47:45       He did best in guys holding hands, driving off the cliff and it driving across the country, just blowing guys in rest areas, just blowing guys and shooting women, women that don't want it to be gay. That gone down. And then they're running shoes. No, let her run first because it wasn't, wasn't telling the Louise like some guy did something horrible to them. The way that guy was Brad Pitt. Oh Shit. That's right. Right. That's when it was a young, sexy. Aw, God dammit. He was good looking man, man. Oh, the tits on him. That was perfect. That was a great movie though. That was like the first chick buddy movie where the chicks were gangster. Right. You know, this was a few of those moments where the chicks were like super fucking bad ass in a believable way. One of the best ones was pulp fiction,

Speaker 2:          02:48:34       pulp fiction and kill bill was just as bad ass.

Speaker 6:          02:48:37       Or how about this? Maybe even better. What was the, not, not pulp fiction. What was the one with Kush Christian Slater that, uh, turns turn around aunts dude. Yeah, she was great. Come on man. What's her name? Patricia or cat. Is it Patricia Arquette or the other one? Well, there was two movies that were similar. There was patty Arquette did one. Uh, and then, uh, what's her name? There's a David Arquette. Patricia Arquette. It was a trip. She was the one in true romance. Yeah. When was at Gamble Fini

Speaker 1:          02:49:08       and her have that fucking crazy fight scene or was it John Madsen? Who Was it? Who else is in it is Gandolfini in it. That's all it says for the cast. Dennis Hopper. But who uh, no, there was somebody that got in that, that it was getting a Fini. Yeah. Again, the Fini beats the shit out of her and she eventually kills him at the end and it was just so wa cause it was like believable. She was talking shit while I was beating the fuck out of her and then she eventually kills him and it's just so wild and primal when she does and she's all fucked up and beaten up. Like you really felt like she had been in a fight and just killed this. Fuck did, it wasn't like a Charlie's angels type thing. It was so real. It was so real bozo with Juliette Lewis, natural born killers that was pretty natural born killers was amazing.

Speaker 1:          02:49:58       Yeah. I want to get her in here, man. We, she said she would do it too. She said she would do the podcast. She's a comedy Fan, right? She didn't have a lot of comics. She's a fascinating person and she believes that like Tom Cruise is a victim of like propaganda when it comes to like anti Scientology propaganda. I would love to hear someone who's like a happy scientist. She's a psychologist. Hardcore. Wow. Unless she doesn't want to talk about that. Do you had at Scientologists? Not before. No. No. It's curious how much they want to talk about it. I just have one neighbor couldn't shut the fuck up about it. Right. He loved it. He was telling me about how his wife was going. Clear. Yeah. She was spending 50 grand turned clear, 50 grand. When you know what happens when you're clear, you're no longer negatively affected by outside influence.

Speaker 1:          02:50:42       Gregory. That's amazing. It's incredible. Fixes everything. 50 50 just pay up. Probably going to be some math outside influences cause you're going to be broke. You Go, this guy wanted to buy a piece of property and he couldn't buy it because his wife was going clear. I'm not kidding. He was talking about this piece of property. He wanted to, you know, it was like adjacent to his, his property and was thinking about buying it but he couldn't afford it because it's trying to get you to a meeting. Uh, no. Nope, nope, nope. Explained it to me. Tell me how much it benefited him but it wasn't proselytizing. Thank goodness. Wow. That would have been ugly. That would be Dang Dong, Mr Ogun. Oh you're in there. It's me happiness. Your happiness awaits its clarity. Its at the door. It's your choice. Go with clarity or with none.

Speaker 1:          02:51:28       The coast is clear Gel. Don't they like to use like acronyms they have to, they use abbreviations or whatever it is for like all these different types of people. Suppressive people. They have all these different like things that they call upon when they define like various aspects. Negative people that you're encountering in your life that disbelieved the tenants of Scientology. Yeah. There's like orgs, orbs, something. I read a book about a written by the niece of the guy who is the head of Scientology. She broke out. She talked about being a child slave. Like they literally separated her and me while her uncle is the head of Scientology. So she had juice, still took her away from

Speaker 2:          02:52:06       her parents and senator when all child colony where she was raised and then brought to Hollywood. So to live, they kept moving around. Every time she gets settled in, they just uproot her, separated from her brother centered a fucking Florida, Sandra de la, the desert. And she talked about how the kids built the entire colony that they lived in. They did all the, they would just put them out to work every day. They work like eight hours just weeding and gardening and building fences and all this crazy shit. And they would get schooled for like two hours a day. And it was mostly Scientology schooling. What's the name of the book? Uh, raised by you remember the woman? Hmm. I get the worst fucking memory. I can look it up, Jamie. You'll find it. He'll fire and it's, I got to read that and it just tracks how, you know, then she, they, they don't want you to procreate because babies are a burden on the church.

Speaker 2:          02:53:05       They want you to work. They want to create worker bees and they discourage the, you know, how much does someone like Tom Cruise have to pay? They pay 10%. I think it's tithing. Yeah. It's probably like a 10% tithe Straw. And they got some videotapes. If you don't want to pay or, you know, the, they make it worth your while to pay the benefit. You, they, they throw rose petals wherever that guy walks and this and they're a publicity firm. They, they, they, whatever you want changed about your, uh, uh, p is this the book beyond belief? Yeah, that's it. My secret life inside Scientology and my heroine escape by Jenna Miscavige. Yes. Miscavige and Miscavige is the name of the guy who's the head of Scientology. Wow. Yeah, that's crazy. I mean, it's really crazy that she wrote it because she was, when she left the church, she was threatened by, I mean, this is her fucking family. And they would come down and like threatened her, threatened her, uh, her brother who was still inside the church, threatened her mother. They don't fuck around.
