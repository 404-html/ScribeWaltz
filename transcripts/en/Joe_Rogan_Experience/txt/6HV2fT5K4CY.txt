Speaker 1:          00:00:16       Okay. What?

Speaker 2:          00:00:38       Huh?

Speaker 1:          00:00:41       Cool. [inaudible]

Speaker 3:          00:02:16       ladies and gentlemen, brothers and sisters. Lovers and children. Dana d mom does in the house. Give it up for Dana. Dana and I are e pals. We tweet each other back and forth, but this is our first time actually meeting each other in real life. Cool. You're very funny. You say some funny shit on Twitter and you said you had a really fun thing where you broke down this Jennifer Anniston. Uh, again. Uh, what's his name? Adam Sandler movie. It was really funny. Yeah. If you haven't seen it, you can get it done. It's on youtube. On your, what does it, does it say just don't go with it. Just don't go with it. Yeah, I'm really funny and really like you, you, you know, you broke it down like comic would break it down like how ridiculous it is. First of all, I thought it was hilarious that you said that Jennifer Aniston was the human equivalent to okay.

Speaker 4:          00:03:06       Meal meal like perfect. That is absolutely perfect. Nutritious. I would've said grilled cheese sandwich thing. I would have called her a grilled grilled cheese, grilled cheese sandwich truck. You don't see an oatmeal track anywhere? No lines. I would give her more credit with meals. What I'm saying, I think you being a little unfair. I will. I'll give her a little more than oatmeal, but I know what you're saying. You know, I'm wondering, I got this no love for Jennifer Aniston. She's just a chick trying to get some money doing her acting things, viral smartwater video and she's trying to like be with all the youtubers and like make a viral video to go smart water thing. She ain't hurting anybody. Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:03:52       It's easy to get caught up in hating someone for no reason. And she's, she's not somebody. Well why her Jennifer Kell go after Kadafi Kadafi is going to leave her dash, go off the car, gas, you know, NASA. Do you feel about that? But then you know, I mean it's also, you know, if you live in a glass house, don't throw rocks, like live your own fucking life. Who gives a shit? But you're right. Her stuff, what she's doing, it's all like, God damn bitch, don't you have enough money? They want to do some interesting now everything you fucking do is like the same. Goddamn Laurie. You know those romance and did the worst date movies ever. Because if you, you're going on this date, if you're a guy you're already giving in to the fact that you're doing whatever you can to fuck you're, you're gonna, you're gonna pretend to be someone you're not. You're going to like, I would never ask a check to go see some crazy fucking stupid werewolf movie if they weren't into it. You know what I mean? I would've never, but women can ask a guy to go see some wonky ass date night bullshit. Jennifer Aniston. God Forbid Sandra Bullock movies. Those motherfuckers, Huh?

Speaker 4:          00:04:53       Sandy [inaudible] Mars. Every little sandy you love. Say that because of what happened to her. Yeah. I was just gonna say exactly why. Right. I was going to bitch about no strings attached to cause Natalie Portman. You have an Oscar, but still making bullshit like no strings attached. Poor me. I'm the most attractive person ever. Me and Ashton Kutcher were going to have no strings attached sex. Boom. They can fuck anybody anywhere, any day of the week. A new person every single day, and they're going to make a fucking hat. Yes. Oh, we're just going to be friends and have sex and it won't get complicated. I wonder what's going to happen? Well, do they fall in love?

Speaker 3:          00:05:34       You're the girl. You have to understand what happens. She, she's sitting around, her agent calls them, this is what we have for you. It's a big movie. It's blah, blah, blah. Everyone's all hyped on it and next thing you know, like I've read for shit that I really, I'm happy I never gone. He could just get talked into going in on these things. The next thing you know, you're in an office. Next thing you know you're signing the papers. Next thing you know a movie set and you're doing this fucking terrible movie. You know boo hoo cry for you. No big deal. But I'm just saying they're just, they're just out there doing their shit. She looks fantastic

Speaker 5:          00:06:02       pregnant. They should do that movie though, where it's like, it's sold like that where you know exactly what's going to happen. They're going to fall in love and cheap, but then it's actually like he murders her.

Speaker 3:          00:06:10       Larry's his body, like an alien. He only wants her eggs. That would be a good idea for a movie trailer. I saw, um, uh, what was it called? Um, bureau. What the fuck's it called? Adjustment Bureau. I am so behind in movies right now. I don't even know what this is. God Damn decent. It's a based on a Phillip K. Dot. Dick novel. So it was really weird. It was really trippy. I like really surprising. Like I thought it was just going to be a s uh, a typical dumb movie and it was, there had a lot, there's a lot of dumb elements, but you kind of have to have some dumb shit and a lot of movies. Just to wrap up a complicated premise inside of two hours right now you've got to have some one guy that's that thing. It's also like, what is his motivation when he's ridiculously in love with her and you know, barely, you know, well why is this going on? Really? Wow. I mean C'mon really, I mean your dwell on this shift three years later because it's meant to be and it's all written down somewhere. It was fascinating. We went about it

Speaker 4:          00:07:05       wrack my brain over back to the future and that's like from 1985 and I'm like still things bother me about it so much like the time or almost nothing. The rape part like so we've been back to the future. Yeah. Beth tries to rape Lorraine and that's right. And the alternate future that really don't have them like wash his car, the stuff like, you know, it's weird in that time you tried to wake me up. Great. I like, I like it bothers me some really. I never even thought about that. But yes, that again I do take a lot of medicine, kind of hone in on that kind of stuff. What about the rapes?

Speaker 3:          00:07:41       I don't remember anything about that movie. I, you know, I'm, I'm finding as I get older, like I've definitely used up hard drive space and deleted a lot of files because I would watch movies now and it's like I never watched it before. I watched a simple mind the other day, the, the uh, the Russell Crowe movie about that genius mathematician, Beautiful Mind, simple mind, beautiful minds and it was fucking great. I had no idea what was going to happen. I literally didn't remember the movie, but I know I've seen it. I'm just, I've known amount of space. I got no space, man.

Speaker 5:          00:08:09       That's what, like that's social network. That's what's going to happen with that movie to me and like 10 years, like it was a great movie, but that's not a movie you'll remember at all

Speaker 3:          00:08:17       are so many movies, man. If you really stop, you know, it's like, and I was going to ask you this because you, you do porn. Like why the fuck are they still making porn movies? There's just no way you could've seen them. All right? There's no way you need a new one if you're really just beating off. There's no way, unless you're fixating on very specific actresses, which a lot of guys do, but if you're not, if you're just beating off Jesus Christ, that's when I seen them all.

Speaker 5:          00:08:40       That's one thing I've noticed though. It is the characters. It is you've, you, you like a certain actress and you start wanting to see it. Like before horn was always to me porn was jacking off, but then I never really got into characters since like Twitter where now I'm following people on Twitter and stuff that now I'm starting

Speaker 3:          00:08:56       to get them though I wouldn't see a movie with that person. And Yeah, so I see that now that Twitter is helping it at a little bit. Yeah, that's, that's, that's definitely what's become a mean. It's become that with comics as well, you know, it's like people reaching out and you, you develop like your fan base and then you all communicate with each other. And then I guess when some dudes walking off too, it's like much more personal, you know, are more fun. Kind of feel like they own you a little bit, a little bit disconcerting. Did people get douchey with you because of that? Like I'm a fan. Like I demand this

Speaker 4:          00:09:25       even like today coming here, um, people are like, uh, it's Joe Rogan going to fuck you. And I'm like, I'm a person. Like, you know like you have your thing. Isn't that when you're done that in the, you know, it's just like this isn't a movie. This is real life and you have your real life and outside of comedy and your podcast and MMA stuff and TV and movies. You have your own personal life. Right? Me Outside of my Twitter feed, my bath aid, but my bathtub thing like what's your mouth? I just spend like five hours a day in the bathtub.

Speaker 3:          00:10:01       You just sit around the taking not get clean enough or are you one of those? Oh all I've done so much porn constantly. Just never ever cleaned. Do it on like a Webcam or something? No, I just like, no, I'm looking bad to be in the tub. You should do it on web cause there is there a psychological thing there or are you just like to do it? Yeah, just comfortable. Just feels good to be on the top.

Speaker 4:          00:10:20       Yeah. I'm not wearing clothes and gives me from eating, taking food in the Bathtub is growth.

Speaker 3:          00:10:28       He's get an isolation tank that's part of the cat man. That'd be awesome. When the cat in the hat comes back. That's where he starts trouble each cake in a, in a tub. See that's where it's all done properly. That mother Fucker, those little kids in trouble almost and then he pulls it out with magic at the very end. So yeah, most people don't eat in the bathtub while you're up to date with your cat in the hat. Shit son. I have a two and a half year old. I know she loves the cat in the hat and I love reading it. Like I get all enthusiastic about it. It's fucking great writing. That's a cat in the hat. Especially the cat in the hat comes back. That one is the shit medicine Shel Silverstein yet. No Man. What? Just like walk in and get that.

Speaker 3:          00:11:04       You will fucking love it. It'll be great. You will read that shit as a kid. The chat and the hat seems awful. Psychedelic magic kind of has got a crazy hat and magic. Fuck Michel Silverstein. I'm not about, I'm not interested in man. You're talking nonsense. I'm telling you about something awesome and you're telling me about something else that I have no idea what it is. Very similar. Let's talk about what's awesome. I don't want to hear about the chivalry. Chad the how does the shit son, he's a cat with a magic fucking hat. He pulls his cat off and there's little cat, a little cat a pulls his hat off, there's little cat B look at, see and it gets all the way down. A little cat Z and little cat Z has volume and you don't know what the fuck loom is, but boom fixes everything.

Speaker 3:          00:11:45       And when it gets down to the little cat z with the fucking shit hits the fan. When the cat fucks everything up, he gets to the tub dirty. He gets pink shit out in the snow and on the $10 shoes and on mom's dress and everything is a fucking disaster. And he keeps pulling out little hats so other cats can help them and they just fuck shit up. Worse and worse until it gets a little cat Z and little cat. He's got the reset, reset switch. He pulls out, boom and boom, just bang. No matter what and you look at Czi is so small, you can't even fucking see him. He's not visible to the naked eye. Okay, so they're going macrocosm on your ass band. They're going quantum physics, right? That's how bad ass cat in the head is so fucked. Your stupid. What was her name again?

Speaker 3:          00:12:28       This is shell silver's. Shel Silverstein construct the cat in the hat's car. How about that? That's what I got to say. I need to, I need this. The cat naps is a shit. I need to have some kids because I haven't read this shit in a while. You know when you don't have kids. The idea of reading kids cat and that story sounds like fucking painful punishment. People. I've, when I've been in the position where I didn't have kids, where I looked at people at kids like, oh, you trapped fucked. Like, oh my God. Oh, you're doomed. You're stuck to that trip forever. There's no way not to. We not to. It's normal if you don't have kids. That's how it's supposed to be set up until you have them. Of Your own, you're supposed to like to, to complete your mission in life. Like your, your motivation and your goals are to be as uninstalled as possible.

Speaker 3:          00:13:11       So when you see entanglements and other people's lives, you recognize them as disgusting things you never want to see in yourself. That's why like you see, like if someone's acting like an asshole or someone's acting selfish or jealous, those feelings that you get from seeing, they'll be like, oh, it's so gross. That's a message to you that's you're supposed to learn from this. And you're supposed to never ever be what that person is. I guess they're there for you. And when you see people with kids, if they're not yours, you get to this a screwy message. You get this message of all, look at this poor fuck. And you think about all the worst aspects of all your relationships and how you know you could possibly be entangled. Some other person. And then there's a fucking kid wants stop crying at all you're doing. But when you have them, all of a sudden it's like, Whoa, there's this little human and they're your little friends.

Speaker 3:          00:13:52       And it's you like, it's not really another person. It's a part of you that's become its own individual. You love it literally more than you love yourself and then reading to them and playing with them. It's fun. It's fuck. It's like you've got this little pal, like she makes me laugh all the time. She shows me her dumps. She takes these giant shits. They're fucking huge. They come out of this little tiny body. Can't believe how big are shits are. You should start twittering. It's her twin. No Way. It would be jerking off to my baby shit. If they fixed that, they fixed my cock. Oh, of course. There would be at least like five guys. If you showed how big your baby shit was, what else could I fit in that ass? They were thinking about stuff in their kid's poop today, Joe. Exactly. There's at least one guy who's going to say that, but she thinks it's hilarious. She goes, I just made a poop log and poop is what she knows is funny because it's funny coming out of a two year old, so that's like the Goto word.

Speaker 6:          00:14:52       Yeah, no. Whenever you know. What does it smell like? Poop. Everything smells like poop. Like she'll say everything smells like poop and laugh. That's awesome.

Speaker 5:          00:14:59       You gotta get, you gotta get her in on it. There's a show called a venture time. I highly recommend it. It's like a, it's like a trippy show for kids, but if you're an adult you will fucking want to get high and watch it. Amazing. Yeah. Really? Yeah, it's the next Maria Bamford on it. Steve Agee said that he did something on it, like a bunch of really talented people. It's really cool to flapjack a flapjack got canceled, so now he's on it too. Fucking awesome. Would you ever do a cartoon voice? I think, I think that would be one of your ideal things. I think I have, but we did it. You did a family guy or American dad or something like that, you remember?

Speaker 6:          00:15:38       Well, I did it. Yeah. I did a cartoon voice on family guy and I did um, fuck what else I had done with the little kid. Shit. I feel like I've done something before. I've read some books or read some books that we became like books on CD long time ago with Mario Lopez. Oh no way. Yeah. It was kind of fun man. Cause you're reading a Kid's story and re yeah, it's hot as fuck. Um, and I always remember like, you know, like how much I was a little kid to like listen to like a sat of someone tell a story. Right. It was like fucking cool. It'd be tucked in bed and you hear some really exciting story, you know, so it was fun. It was fun doing,

Speaker 5:          00:16:15       speaking of Lopez, you remember when we had Alison on she, she was a extra behind Mario Lopez and she was just staring at him like she was like the terminator with this really evil, well she's done it again, but this time she did it even better. Like at the beginning they like high five when they come back from a commercial Mario Lopez and her, and then she immediately goes right back into the character and she's just staring at him down and looking, but she overdid it. This, she might, she's overdoing it this time. Just acting. Be Crazy on TV, so it's middle of what is going on with that chick. Exactly. Exactly. The first time I met her

Speaker 6:          00:16:50       and she was a Brian, she's very nice, very nice person. First Time I met her I'm like, dude, is that girl angry like what's going on man? I feel like, did I upset her? Then I say something rude and I'm like, I don't even remember. I remember interacting. She's got this mean face, but then she's super

Speaker 5:          00:17:03       yes, because the person that every, she just gets lost in overthought I think. You know, like she's constantly, you know, just thinking about things and then

Speaker 6:          00:17:09       she looks angry. It's called winning, winning, winning, winning. It was Charlie Sheen. Meme was hit a, it's turned a corner. Turned a corner. I watched the podcast and also this is not fun anymore. There was, there's two, there's three now, but there's two different versions. There's one where he actually tries to do like a talk show. It's very strange and it's very cocaine because everyone in the room is like all happy and laughing at nonsense and there's this one guy who won't stop playing fart sounds. It's like, you know, he probably listen to the Howard stern show up twice and you know and said, oh well this is probably all it tastes fucking fart board and this guy's blown off farts in the for no reason

Speaker 3:          00:17:50       whatsoever. And Charlie's like reading off Cue cards, just trying to have those synapses fire in some sort of a reasonable and understandable sequence cause it just cocaine madness in that brain. His brain is ravaged, dude, he's got blow out holes in walls and water's leaking out. No one knows what the fuck happens. Your brain, when you blow seven fucking gram rocks, you're, you're snorting them and smoking them for years and years. He's fried. He's barely trying to keep it together. What if this is all a set up for a movie? It would be a million fucking this movie. Yeah. I mean maybe not. Maybe not. Maybe the best way. Never ever be on Charlie Sheen Bandwagon. Fuck him. Why? Why is he there? I Dunno. That's the best way to get people mad. I think it's just to be like I'm not into what you're into. Fuck. You actually have not been watching or following any of it.

Speaker 3:          00:18:45       I feel like I, there's no reward in that for me. But there was a real board and following it, there's a reward and studying it. Like he's some fucking Lewis and Clark of cocaine and whores, you know, he's like out there in the woods and you know and shit in the [inaudible] been around for very, very long time, but no one's been able to rock it like 2.2 mil Olia about two mil a week is how you discover something new. He's got radical amounts of money, syndication money. And when you have that kind of money, that's how there's dudes show up with briefcases and shit and you know, and there's 50 girls in the room. He's, he's doing it, he's doing other level shit cause you're not supposed to get that rich and still have this crazy appetite for cocaine and horse. You, you're not supposed to be that open about it.

Speaker 3:          00:19:29       You know it's supposed to be that public about it, but that's what, that's what's crazy is that, that's exactly where TV's going. This whole shit is supposedly supposedly this is the realist you can get for reality shows. Now it's having a use stream channel and seeing somebody's about to die except maybe you know. Oh yeah. The whole thing is fucking fake something and directed by Shel Silverstein and this is going to like the next biggest movie ever. Dude. It's fucking, it's so scary when you look at his body and its face like the latest ones, the latest two. It looks like he hasn't eaten or slept in days. Like his skin is loose on his face. He looks like an old man. Yeah, I'm, it's because he's lost all this weight. How old? Look at them. It looks like older than me and I don't know.

Speaker 3:          00:20:14       I know I don't look like I did when I was young. I look at myself when I was young and I'm like, wow, how weird is that? Like that's me. I'm decaying, you know? I'm like, my body is morphing and changing, but I look better than that dude. Yeah. That looks like Hugh Hefner to Hugh Hefner right there. Yeah. That's an old man. There's like a 60 year old man, by the way. We're looking on Ustream that he has his whole, all his videos and channels. Uh, his name is w y t r on Ustream. And uh, this is Wy TV, Bro. TV, you know, here's the, I think that's just one of them that's on, I mean I think you can, you can watch

Speaker 6:          00:20:48       the actual Charlie Sheen went on Charlie Sheen's channel. This is the guy who was a re re competent. Oh. It looks like, but this one almost has a million views, so yeah, this might be it. Okay. Maybe it is it, but, well, here's what disturbs me. Look at it. The pointiness of the shoulder. Look at the bones. Yeah. That's weird. He's dying. He's dying. Yeah, that's, that's real. You know, he's dying and he's winning. Yeah. He looks like he looks like Steve Jobs right there. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          00:21:11       Oh, livers. Friends playing. Yeah. Maybe that's what it is. Maybe that's why is all this horror. Isn't his house there? He's like Madison or Oregon. I'm on Zubich Charlie.

Speaker 6:          00:21:22       I used to say that about Dick Cheney. Dick Cheney probably has like seven secret service agents but only six are real circuit service agents. One guy was just some dude who's got his blood type waiting, harvesting Dick Cheney to die so they're going to cut this dude open like a fish harvesters. One guy behind them with a truck with ice in it and it's ready to throw the heart in there while it's still beating. What blood type are all those whores? Do you guys know what you are? Okay. I don't even know what blood type I think I have like a cat blood type or something. Okay. Oh positive. Positive. [inaudible] is the only one here that's not high. She was scared. She didn't want to go deep. We'll nervous.

Speaker 4:          00:22:00       I am a little nervous. It's very hard to be. Same Room with people who are professionally funny because not funny. I could just fucking open my ass and like accepted huge cop, you know and then everything will be okay. Things will pan out for me. Everybody would like you. Yeah.

Speaker 6:          00:22:18       Hello. Say Well I'll wait to go. Yeah. Cause I can fall back on just, you know, being pretty enough. You don't have to worry about anything. Just be yourself. You don't have to be funny. You don't have to be just right back to you because I like to be in. You are, but you know what, no more than you have to be like the, the beautiful thing about this podcast for real is that it's like a conversation. You know, it's like when people get a chance to see is it's like you get an in on, uh, an interesting conversation, you know? And so just for yourself, so you're all good. That's enough to just be funny. But you are, you are funny. And if you haven't seen that clip, it's very funny. Have you ever thought about doing comedy?

Speaker 4:          00:22:51       Um, I don't know cause it's kind of hard because I'm like already socially, uh, social and marginalized by being a sex worker. And then people kind of expect you to be like sexy. And then I already had this conversation with Brian about female comics and how it's like, that's already, you're kind of a run down on the ladder because you, you know, my boyfriend, my period, my cats, you know, kind of stuff. And it's really hard to get out of that. It's uh, that is a business. It's very hard for women and somebody like me coming in, uh, like being pretty and being a porn star and you know, being like having a dirty mouth or whatever, I feel like I'd be kind of painted into a certain corner of being expected.

Speaker 6:          00:23:40       How can you be painted more than you are ready? I know. That's why I'm so as a porn, how could do and be in a female comic, which is, I mean arguably the general consensus, it would be a notch many notches above on the social ladder. Like how would it possibly fuck you up by being funny as well as doing what you already do. Maybe I'm just afraid of failing to be that right.

Speaker 4:          00:24:04       I mean it's, it's very intimidating. Like, I, I do like your comedy bits for videos and stuff like that and people can have always call me cause they need like a, a pretty girl or a naked girl or someone will do a full frontal and whatever and I could explore and I get jokes and stuff like that. But um, you know, I don't know if I can just be like, here are my series of jokes and then try to like change it from, you know, I feel like it would have to fall back on being a porn star for the basis of my comedy, which is something that is kind of counter productive to what I do as a porn star because I sort of market myself as a girl next door and a normal person, you know? So it'd be like folded in on it.

Speaker 6:          00:24:48       No. Would, I really don't think it would because you would just be yourself on stage. I need that.

Speaker 5:          00:24:56       That's fine. Maybe we're not the same light, I think. I think what you said or you know, saying, I don't know, I was going to help you just reading your tweets. I think you're fucking hilarious. And even if you just took, what I do is I usually think of a tweet that I really like and then I've tried to write a little story around that tweak. Is that pretty much is the meat of the goal

Speaker 6:          00:25:15       are, or though, I'm sorry, what was that? Opened that up so we can see what we're seeing. We're, we're doing just in case. Yeah,

Speaker 5:          00:25:20       but that's like the meat of a joke, you know, like a tweet it tweet. It pretty much is the best part of a joke usually, you know? So I think you'd be really good at it. Just based on your, on your,

Speaker 6:          00:25:28       what a tweet is, is just 140 characters. Just writing material, you know? It's just, it's, it's just, and, and not, and not, that's the beautiful thing about it. Sometimes it's just whatever the fuck you think about anything. You know, like I was talking about like I, I made a tweet last night that I was watching this Charlie sheen thing and then he sounds like hunter s Thompson [inaudible] boys, you know, he's got this crazy nutty Gonzo thing going on. I'm like, wow, this is weird. Like now I'm stuck. Is that like a drug thing? It's not like you just go too far over the edge and you just, you know, everything's firing all fucking goofy. Is that what it is?

Speaker 4:          00:26:02       Well Charlie Sheen has been famous pretty much all his life and he was like born into a famous family too. So I mean that kind of sets you back a little bit to begin with because you're already scrutinized and being watched pretty closely and you're in a bubble because you're rich or poor from the moment you're born basically. Yeah.

Speaker 6:          00:26:20       What standup comedy makes you do is be real as fuck. You can't fake it. You can't pretend something's going on. It's not going on. And what's happening is happening. And when you're talking about something, you better be actually thinking about something or those little animals out there are going to smell it. But I know and it's not going to work

Speaker 4:          00:26:37       like me. Fucking happy heckler. I'm no worse. Yeah, you heckled Mike Young. I know it so funny though.

Speaker 7:          00:26:44       It was entertaining to like the 11 people that were there. Well listen, Mike Young needs it. He needs it just as long as you don't do that to anybody. Good. And don't do it. Just calming. Sometimes we bomb when we're trying to work something out. Like when you are working things out, I'm sure you can. I'm sure you, you, you just felt insulted by what Mike Young was selling. I know that feeling miserable. You can, you can, you know, guys can go down a bad road. It's loud.

Speaker 6:          00:27:27       You can come do a Joe show tomorrow if you want to do a five minute set of reading your Twitter. Where do a show tomorrow. Yeah. Um, before I, even this weekend is comedy and Magic Club. Um, so, uh, this a Friday and Saturday where the comedy Magic Club in her most of the beach and uh, tickets or there's, there's still some left but not much. And then next week, Friday night we're going to a, Gotham is beating me and the wild Jew and a at Gotham at a nice feeling, a flashlight, the alien. And that's next, uh, next Friday night and then Wednesday tomorrow sounds, sounds comedy hall. And how like Tom Segura, Christina and a lot of people licensed Lessinger either to, a lot of people are going, it's going to be really fun and that's a great place to fuck around. I came up with two new jokes last time I was there really just on stage.

Speaker 6:          00:28:15       Yeah. That's awesome. Because it's such a little intimate environment and everyone knows that. It's like you're there for that, you know, it's like everyone knows that you're there. I do my material but I'm really there to do my, I want to entertain you, but I also want to like go down crazy roads to see what happens completely free ball. And you can't do that in a big crowd. You need to do that in like an 80 seat or in 90 seater, then you just, you really know what's funny and what's not. You can't get off any tricks and an intimate environment are really small room. You can't get off any tricks. It's like it's either funny or it's not and it's very truthful, you know? And you could do that. I'm telling you, you can do it. So when you're, when you're talking about not wanting all these other things, like not wanting to be, to me, you've already managed to avoid that in the most demeaning job possible.

Speaker 7:          00:29:00       Yeah, seriously. I don't feel like it's that demeaning. I think that there could be forced fuck anyone. Yeah.

Speaker 6:          00:29:07       Judges, judges, anybody, the son hurting anybody. If anybody just not hurting anybody, whatever you're doing. Wow. How weird. It may be.

Speaker 7:          00:29:15       What makes you happy? I'm brainwashed or maybe I need to be rescued or maybe I just, I was raised in properly or you know, or I'm still going to be heat then or something that I'm just, you know, I need the right person to slap some sense into me because big damage

Speaker 6:          00:29:30       for most people, that's the case for most people in your business, that's the case. I mean, it's not an irrational reason for them to think that it doesn't account for all variability. There's a, there's a lot more variables, variabilities, there's a lot more variables. It doesn't count for all of them. And there's people can be, you know, into all kinds of things for no fucking reason. And to say that it's all from abuser. Yes. So you were happy, you were happy growing up, happy for her.

Speaker 4:          00:29:54       Yeah, very. You know, mom, dad, brother, cats, everybody

Speaker 6:          00:30:01       just really open about sex in your house. Like how did you become? So,

Speaker 4:          00:30:04       uh, I don't know. I was like, I'm weird and I've always been weird. Like I asked my mom what would I like when I was a kid and she was like pretty much exactly the same way as you are now just shorter. And I was like okay. Then like it was kind of neurotic, silly person for a very long time and I never had like any sex talks with my parents. I think at a certain point they were like, it's really normal to experiment with sex and drugs but you probably shouldn't drink. And I was like, well I'm going to go get drunk. Cause if my parents think that drugs and sex are cool, they must suck or be nerdy or whatever. Like I they, I kind of went Alex p Keaton on them.

Speaker 6:          00:30:42       Right. Little little flip man. That's something you got to really be aware of when you're raising kids. You can't just tell them what you want them to do,

Speaker 4:          00:30:48       right? No you don't.

Speaker 6:          00:30:51       Yeah. You gotta kind of figure out a way to trick them, trick the little monsters and yeah, that's right. Yeah. So you just gravitated towards the alcohol to be a rebel.

Speaker 4:          00:31:01       Yeah. I was like, have like a really bad drinker when I was younger and I went through phases where I would not drink at all, but then like pick right up and like be a drunk person until I was like 23. Wow. Yeah. I was just like, ah, I didn't and like sex. Oh, I mean I wasn't like super interested in it. Like I had boyfriends and stuff and like my parents never tried to make me feel bad about sex, but the men that I was with always dead like

Speaker 6:          00:31:26       that made you feel bad about it.

Speaker 4:          00:31:27       About like having how many people I've had sex with or like what I'm into or whatever. And I would just like, I always found it to be pretty strange. So I guess like my parents raised me to have good, um, ideas about sexuality but really like wasn't really pant like laid out for me in any way

Speaker 6:          00:31:48       for men. You know, you want to know how many partners because then the likelihood of her leaving you becomes assessed. Like how long are you sure.

Speaker 4:          00:31:54       That is such a sensitive thing to say, which I think is really interesting because I think that a lot of people would say, you know, you know, and to see if she like a whore or slutty or if she was like disease or whatever. Okay.

Speaker 6:          00:32:06       She's gonna get me herpes. There's that too. There's that. She's not special.

Speaker 4:          00:32:09       That's pretty, yeah. Pretty interesting.

Speaker 6:          00:32:14       Yeah. Well what the fuck is your, your uh, a comp. You're, you're an accumulation of all your experiences, sexual or wherever the fuck you want it. I mean, maybe you may miss, the only problem is it becomes like you find out about like trains that were run on her and like how many times damn bitch. Like how many gang bangs? Three. Fuck, you know, and then you start thinking, how can I ever think that that's what sex is special between us? You know, how could I ever think that, uh, that this is, uh, this is

Speaker 7:          00:32:42       real worthy of my love. Real Shit. Yeah. It's not what I seen in the movies. You know, it's not what I see in Sandra Bullock's movies. Sandra Bullock never gets a train run on her. She doesn't go to work and get fucked. Me asked me to come home and want to cuddle with you so she could fucking do whatever now. No.

Speaker 6:          00:32:57       Yeah. Not for a woman. She can go full on vanish. She's, she's one of the verge of vanishing already. She's 40 years old, 43 years old or something like that. She is very cute, but you're not going to want to see her. And she's 60 in a romantic comedy about alone trying to find her way and she coached a bunch of black guys that are playing football and she learns. Yeah,

Speaker 7:          00:33:17       like in the blind side movie, she was a little bit of a like a mom, not like a girlfriend or sex a boss.

Speaker 6:          00:33:27       It's so funny how we identify with someone who's going through some crazy stripe on television. Crazy crap. She didn't deserve that. She seems nice enough.

Speaker 7:          00:33:35       Yeah. But I do wonder why she was married to that Jesse James and that seems completely tattooed all over the planet. What is that about? I never really understood that. Is that like a, they both enjoy cocaine or something or he's a charmer

Speaker 6:          00:33:47       charmer. There's some guys that are charmers and I think, uh, he was very obsessed with being famous. Listen to me, I'm like, Okay Nancy Grace,

Speaker 7:          00:33:56       what do we have here is a charmer. He is a bullshit artist and he's getting this girl to believe him. Now we have a dead baby in Florida, which talks about this a dead baby in Florida. Nancy grace is on that shit. You'll look for this story on cnn.com you will find nothing. Whoo. Here we have the mother come home from war boss cigarettes with the baby in the car now. I love it. She hates the Anthony so much. Casey Anthony killed her daughter. Kaylee. And why was she seems cool, but no, but like the thing is she's not like ever trying to present herself as like an impartial news part. Like and Casey Anthony, they will figure out the truth about you cause you murder your baby. Well, he's like I said, that's totally bias. Well, she's not alive. She's not supposed to be a news person.

Speaker 7:          00:34:50       She's like a discussion person. No, but she's a former prosecutor. I guess the interesting part of her case, she's got to figure it out. That's a crazy thing is like when she's, when she's talking about tiger woods, like, whoa, Whoa, Whoa, settle the fuck down. Hooker. I thought you were all about dead babies in Florida. What are you doing about black athletes that like the fuck like really? You're gonna, you're gonna spend three weeks working on black athletes that want to fuck. Like really? That's all. Who are these girls? Where do they come from? How did they get his phone number? Well, Nancy grace. Grace with love. So black cock.

Speaker 6:          00:35:28       If anybody could use some black caucus, Nancy grace, I could see her enjoying it. [inaudible] I paid for that. I could see her enjoying it. I can see her getting stuffed. Somebody who just finally fucking treating her like she's really sexual and hot for the like the first time at 2030 years. Oh, she'd get into it. Big Man. Dango Ebony sward

Speaker 4:          00:35:48       that's the word. Yes and no sound. Annunciated the w s ward. Oh, here's a dead man. [inaudible]. See that's fun

Speaker 6:          00:35:58       colony right there. That's timing. You could totally be standup comedian there. You're good. You could totally do it. I'm telling you the same real comics and comics and porn stars are very, very similar. We all come from some fucking weird our ways where we didn't get what we were supposed to get where a young and there's a hole and you know you fill that hole up however you want with jokes.

Speaker 4:          00:36:20       It's the same thing. There's room for both. My whole, yeah, I'm telling you could do it. You could fit hands in there and shit. People didn't clap. You got five minutes tomorrow at Sal's comedy hosts. Oh my God.

Speaker 6:          00:36:33       You don't have to do it. No pressure. You don't want to fuck. Look what happened with her with drinking. Do that dude. You can't push her in a direction. She's going to push back. We're going to take your bullshit.

Speaker 4:          00:36:44       So he says, yeah man, he's just fucking trying to trick you. I saw the funniest photo of you. She has, by the way, she has a accessing with trainees like she like is addicted to trainees. I sold one of his big black tie, seven to like seven to seven, four or something. He was giant. I look at you say she was that kind of huge girl. She said funny. How was it? She was that even a turn on that? I just thought that she was like really owning her shit. She just like work in the room like it must be fucking like I'm five eight and I feel like I'm a little bit too tall and you know, under five, eight. Yeah. I kind of like a trainee. Like sometimes I'm in touch with my inner training, inner training, my masculine side, my masculine feminine side.

Speaker 4:          00:37:31       They've a your boner. It's a fem bone on bone or Lesbos. It depends what it's for. Yeah, I dunno. What does that look? Are you guys talking about why but is a terrible time to get your balls caught and your pants and you have to adjust? This conversation is going on my like the last thing allows anybody to think that I'm getting a hard right now, but I'm shifting my balls, pant, Federer moment or I'll put a black bar over there talking about like femme boner or something and I'm like, God damn it. I didn't have to adjust my boss. Uh, looking terrible timing. I'm very obsessed with Rupaul's drag race. I've been watching it for all three seasons and I really like the drag drag queens. They used to hang out with drag queens a lot when I lived in group session. Just you find it cool or interesting when people are just really being themself, right? Even if it means like dressing as a different gender or whatever, it's just because that's like what they feel. Right. It's very ambiguous and I really like that. Why not, right? Yeah. Why the fuck not like I used to go out and like pulling drag looks with drag Queens in Florida and P and I like blended with them because

Speaker 7:          00:38:36       they thought you were a big woman, a dude dressed as well just as a dude dressed as a girl, some pretty next level inception type of shit. It was the next level shit. Yeah, your hands are too small or too small. No Dude, you were really one of those people that were supposed to be born a woman, you know? Wow. That would be the worst. So it's way better to be a woman who looks like might be a tranny. Then a dude who looks like a woman

Speaker 4:          00:39:05       that are like the like girl, like a gin. They're like jeans are just messed up and they just ended up with a deck but they're like really more woman. They have like a whole different, like if they want to do trainee porn, they, it's a very niche and that they look more like women than like someone that may be started transitioning later in life and it was more masculine and so it opens their door to like be like the best transsexual prostitute or a porn star or whatever. Like they could really like cash in on that. You know, people you

Speaker 7:          00:39:35       really want to do to make their sex, like an issue going to be the best possible to compete. And who's the best training? Yeah, they've like training yours. Bailey Bailey. Jay got the best transsexual performer followed the trainees, trainees follow me and I followed them back. And I think they're just hot girls. They're probably just happy that someone accepts them. You know? I figured anybody except the Joe Rogan. Exactly. I think there's a broad spectrum of human behavior. There's a huge spectrum and all I care about that fighting stuff or like fucking stuff and we're teaching people real values. Well, I mean that's what this, this thing is about. This is just a conversation. Yes. You know, we, we, we, it's so easy to judge people valuable. What's the good confused and we would naturally gravitate towards teams. And if you're not on team dress like a guy, all of a sudden there's something fucked up about you.

Speaker 7:          00:40:40       But if you're a fucking guy who really loves dressing like a chick, who the fucking mind, who's anybody to say there's something wrong with them? Why not? 80 girls dress like guys all the time and you never have a problem with it. I mean, I don't want to dress like a woman, but I don't give a shit if you do really strikes hot Hilary swank, Hilary swank, and I think she's hot. I think Hillary's is, I got, if I've heard dude say that they think she looks like a man, I'm like, I dunno. Maybe you need to get a certain amount of man in you. You mean to be a certain amount of masculine to appreciate a beauty like Hillary swearing, which is a little on the manly side. You need to be more dominant, more masculine than her. Yeah. You don't want to be like a frail man and you want to Fuck Hillary. Swank shall mount you and ground and pound you. I am actually probably more masculine than Hillary Swank. The person I would have to the two of you together because

Speaker 3:          00:41:34       when you see someone in real life, like people always telling me when they meet me, God damn, you're so fucking short. I never thought you showing. No, it's true. Five eight but on TV, yeah, but on TV, you know, you look big, you know you're on television. Then these people meet me and they're like towering over me and they're like, well, you know, like you meet a guy, he's like six four and like, oh, I thought you were fucking taller. Like you don't know what anybody's like until you actually meet them. I mean, you'd have to, you'd have to like see like I've met celebrities that I thought were like these big people and there's these little tiny people and look at Conan O'brien. I never knew he was that tall. Very tall, very tall. Which I'm sure it makes it awkward when he does his show because he's a tower is over all these people and he wants to be unassuming and you know, you know it's, it's, it's, it's interesting thing.

Speaker 3:          00:42:13       So who's more manly? You are Hillary Swank. She would have to be sitting right next to you. Cause when she did million dollar baby and she played the boxer, she's like pretty fucking manly. All right. She was, but she was yoked. Do you remember that? I couldn't work out if I didn't love not working out, but she already knew she already did it. So I'm pretty sure she's more masculine than, you know, look, if you were together right next to each other and shape doesn't mean they're like masculine the fuck it doesn't. Yeah, it does. It's all directly related to how difficult it would be to rape you. Yeah,

Speaker 5:          00:42:42       exactly.

Speaker 3:          00:42:43       That's what it is. You look like you'd be a tangle, like kind of. Damn. I couldn't even get hard to fight, fight for my life here. If a man feels like you could just absolutely run away with you, like grab you and

Speaker 4:          00:42:55       tortured people on their balls. I don't think I would have any like problem like trying to like punch someone in the face or rip their eyes out or kick them in the deck or something. I, I've been like very aggressively sexual towards men and shame them. So I feel like that would be an advantage of our rapists rapists out. Nobody tried to rape me cause I can kick your Dick and balls.

Speaker 3:          00:43:16       All I'm saying, why are you trying to get people to rape me? You know your followership don't Rape Dana please. And if you're thinking about it, please stop thinking about it. What I'm saying is that's when a woman becomes a manly looking when she looks how diff. Very rude. Very right. It's so, it's so inconsiderate. I wanna fuck you. Even if you don't want it.

Speaker 5:          00:43:41       This girl I was talking to the other day on a, she sits, she was raped twice and I'm like, I'm like, which one was the better one to break that down, write that down. That's a bit like if you had to choose one, which one was, you've got to do that tomorrow night at south 100%. That is a bit, no doubt about it. That's really funny.

Speaker 4:          00:44:02       I think it's really funny. The bts of porn movies, they'll try to be like, when did you lose your virginity? And some people just full on. I was like how old were you?

Speaker 3:          00:44:12       Yeah, the behind the scenes. Oh that's one for our size. I thought you were sitting like a message board, like a bbs bulletin board.

Speaker 4:          00:44:25       Like the little behind the scenes but it's just people are like, how old were you?

Speaker 3:          00:44:29       They show you guys like Duchenne and cleaning up.

Speaker 4:          00:44:32       I always try to trick people into like watching me p and Douche and stuff cause they're not really supposed to film like peeing because like the distributors have like a problem with it. Well my bloody getting on people. Some places I've seen, but um, I did a movie called girls lie for vivid, all directed by you MCI and it had a girl taking a pregnancy test and she peed on it on the toilet and they can show it because it's like in a medical environment. Yeah, like a normal environment. Like pp goes in the toilet, not in Dana's mouth. I saw that's what you think. I saw a guy pissed in someone's mouth live. It was really funny. I think it's funny, I think it's more hilarious than anything that, you know, somebody like they want to jack off to the movies and I want to see naked people and they want to see some weird shit. But then also kind of like when a laugh, I think

Speaker 3:          00:45:23       it was a, there's a guy that used to do it called extreme Elvis and he, I met him, I met him. Yeah. He's buddies with Doug Stan home and Doug was opening up for him at this bar and the guy goes up there, he's fat as fuck. And he's a really good singer. Like he's really good and the band is tight, you know, it's not just a bizarro show. And then the guy takes his clothes off and he goes, Michael Salus, I'm a complete micro Phallus. I mean it's like to the point where people are laughing hysterical. I believe it's still up on my website. I believe I took a picture of his dick and he's pissing in this woman's mouth. He goes, who else drives gangs? Purse, let's go. Goes. I do. I do. And she gets her knee and I took pictures of the whole thing.

Speaker 3:          00:46:00       I told you I took pictures of them pissing in her mouth, pissing in a glass. She drinks the glass like is fucking crazy. He comes off stage and he's in the crowd and some woman tries to stick a beer bottle up his ass. You can like pee on cue. Yeah. Some woman tries to stick a beer bottle up his ass and he goes, that's the wrong holes right here. Get it right here. Like he helps her stuffed as beer bottle up his ass and she panics and just drops the bottle. Or she panicked, like she thought she would stick her beer bottle up this guy's ass and he would freak out like, Hey, what the fuck? Right. But he goes, you can get in the wrong hole, honey. It's right here. I'll guide you in there. And he starts helping her. I stick a fucking beer bottle up his asshole.

Speaker 3:          00:46:36       But that sounds like this guy's real ready to go. Yeah. So I run into him and I think that's art. I run into him, Paul Provenza show, ah, I run into him at the Paul Provenza show and now he's no longer extreme albus and I think he's like clean and sober now. He used to get hammered as fuck before he did that show. And you know, I was talking to him, I've met him before a while ago, like at the bright spot or something. And I was talking out in the proper vendor show about a guy that I used to know who was a male feminist. That's how he would describe himself as a male feminist. And it was just, it was just as like really sad, weak guy. And yeah, it was very savvy and he was this guy like this really like a bag of Jello as a human being. He was just like, and eventually she left him and so anyway, I was mocking this whole idea of like, how the fuck could you be a male feminist? And after I get off stage, he goes, well, I'm a male feminist. And I'm like, oh wow. I would love to debate you on that.

Speaker 6:          00:47:30       Like we should do some TV. I'm like, you just said it. You just said exactly what I said. Like, uh, the, a fleshy ball of Jello with a micro Fallis and you're a male feminist. Well of course you are. You have to lady. Well basically, no, no offense, you're, you're a bad motherfucker and what you do when you do that crazy Elvis thing. But like, you know, talking about being a feminist, like be whatever the fuck you want to be, but you can't tell me it's not ridiculous. You're, you're, you're like really into the female of the species. Like you're, you're really like thinking of them first. Like, what the fuck are you talking about? How about being a God damn human. I'm going to be in a human across the board sexually, whether it's male, female, gay, straight trans, who gives a shit? How about being across the board? Not a fucking feminist. You dumb ass. You can't defend that, but you only want to help

Speaker 4:          00:48:14       women. You only want to promote women. You fucking weak, bitch. That's weak shit. I don't even call myself a feminist. I wouldn't say. I would say like, I'm not, not a feminist. Things I can get on board with and whatever. But you know, there's so many different waves of feminism that people will come behind you and just be like, Eh,

Speaker 6:          00:48:32       is this grouping everything together? Stupid at the beginning? Yes. All groups are stupid, you know, all of it. Yeah. Were you looking out for what I mean, you can't fucking fix the world. I mean, there's some things that you have to have. Like you have to have some sort of a, uh, an a group that's there to investigate claims of racism when it comes to jobs and stuff like that. I mean you have to have some groups, but as possible. That's good. Sure. Dominated as little as possible, as little goddamn groups as possible. Yeah. That's the key. You know, people get on fucking team mentality mode and they start just going after it almost team Stroup. Oh, more tune queer, you know, Oh, I'm on this, I'm on that. They can't help it. I like it. I like it all just everybody's got to lighten the fuck up, Right Dana? Yes. Isn't that the key to this world? He does say that we'd cook could fix the world probably for real. It sounds silly. It sounds silly coming from a fucking comedian and a porn star and a a video comedian. Real

Speaker 4:          00:49:32       obviously. Yeah. Maybe people listen to us because maybe we were a little bit more

Speaker 6:          00:49:36       formed. I read this post on a message board the other day about this dude who talked about he had smoked pot for the first time in like seven years and he was absolutely terrified to his core. And then it brought up all these crazy thoughts of childhood and he could not handle it and it would open up this fascinating discussion because um, you know, some people were saying that's normal. Some people were saying, well, you got some shit. You got to deal with his fucking with you in the back of your head and you're, and you're sober life. You're not addressing it. But that's why we eat is good for you. You're supposed to look at everything all the time. And a lot of us don't. We like to burry shit in the back of our hand and try not to address whatever's fucking with us. And we just turned a light on that shit. Whenever you have in your life that's fucking with you that you're trying to put deep in your subconscious, marijuana does not allow that. It doesn't allow it. So people say, Oh, it makes me paranoid. Not Know. It's making you think about the, you need to be thinking

Speaker 4:          00:50:28       about, you should be fucking paranoid. You should be aware of how vulnerable you are. The world is very fucked up. I had to like move because people were stealing my mail when I live in silver. Like I had to like move to a high security building. I couldn't feel, I knew where you were. Yeah. Fans like that's, and I was like, I did think I was paranoid, but I was like, no, these people are for real, like know who I am. And it's kind of trippy. Did you have a happy child on you think? Oh yeah, absolutely. Really? I um, my parents were involved in everything. A PTA girl scouting. I was a figure skater or they say finger skating. How does, how do your parents deal with what you do now? Um, I don't know. I don't know if they deal with it. I Dunno.

Speaker 4:          00:51:12       It's not really something that is a non issue. An issue. Yeah. Really. They're like no big deal. You're just, yeah. Having sex on film. Yeah. Wow. That's fascinating. Pretty much. Well, they also see that, yeah, you know, I have a reasonable, uh, you know, amount of following and fan base and people who appreciate what I contribute to the porn industry besides just being like, just you personally more holes in a bunch of fake hair. It's, you know, just uh, so you contribute being your personality and your assumption. Yeah. Yeah, definitely. Yeah. Um, but my, my parent's respect my decisions, which was maybe kind of a very foreign concept for most people because the people, people's parents tend to, you know, tell them what to do. And My, my parents are opposite. They told me like, were they religious at all? No, my parents are religious.

Speaker 4:          00:52:07       What is their background? Oh Man, my, my grandmother is from Germany and I don't think that my mom was raised with a religion because my grandmother was like a new agey dad do for a living, whatever. My Dad does a kind of weird shit like I, he works with at a catering company now. Um, but he was like an onsite security manager of a storage facility and he used to be a CEO of a software company. And he quit that to be a fish farmer and then he like went to like ranch cattle and Oklahoma. Like my dad is just kind of all over the place. Wow. That's Kinda cool though. My Dad is like kind of like a genius at free spirit. All, all sorts of things. But like for that amount of time, you know, he just like, yeah, he's like turbo thruster, like short change careers and your life. My Dad does all the time and my, my mom works, um, at a company that makes stuff to blow up Brown people in Florida. Wow. Wait a missile company like some, yeah, some form of arms. Yeah. It doesn't have to be Brown. We met Jackson, yellow people in North Korea. Sure. Keep talking shit talking shit. But motherfuckers, we got some shit for you. Hey, my mom has been like in her job for a really long time. A bunch of people got mad at me, people

Speaker 6:          00:53:26       MMA forum because I, uh, there was a, we were in Kentucky and there was a, some fights going on and this kid who was a wrestler, a was fighting this other guy who's a kickboxer from Italy, right? And uh, he lives in America, but they were chanting, she will suit you. And I was like, really? Kentucky? And I'm like, that guy lives in Miami. All right, we're all immigrants. All right? Everyone in this fucking country descended from immigrants and no one was here 10,000 years ago. It was all ice. You Fuck, all right, that's the whole deal with America. This guy actually lives here and you're yelling USA. And you know, people were like saying like, you know, there's nothing wrong with patriotism and you're in forcing your beliefs on other people. I'm like, no, I'm, I'm making fun of Shit. I think it's stupid.

Speaker 6:          00:54:07       You know, you're being colored commentary silly. You're yelling at USA. What did just watch these guys for their goddamn technique and their courage and what the fuck they're trying to accomplish. And the difficulty of the task is a great God damn fight, which again is all American wrestler who beat Phil Davis and Ryan Bader is bad ass fucking wrestler and this Italian kickboxer he's trying to get his ground game together. It's a great fucking fight. And he's dildos you, you if they spit all over the back of the person's head in front of them. This dumb fucking mouth breathing cock suckers how a cell and they get mad at you for being upset at it. How else did you feel about that your your time over in Kentucky? Because I, I grew up around there and I going through Kentucky was always a fun time. It always is great dude.

Speaker 6:          00:54:49       Louisville's a great city. The comedy club was fucking fantastic. The people there are super cool. The people that worked there were super cool. It's like, it's got this weird southern sort of like almost hippie thing going on. There's like a lot of like young people there. There's a lot of like open minded people there and then there's a lot of old money and then there's a lot of ghetto. Yeah. So it's this weird combination of shit scar. No, not Alexi. Not In Louisville. Louisville is the old money. It's like, it's a rare part of the south where it's like, there's a lot of like really establish like social clans and groups and social lives. A lot of money, like really, really old money down there. But a lot of educated people too. But they're on that show. The first 48 they're on that show all the time. It was getting jacked in Louisville. I got a Uverse are real dead bodies. That's so creepy. It's dark. It's really weird that you can show, um, you know, anybody getting shot in a movie, but you can't show people really fucking, yeah. So amazing.

Speaker 4:          00:55:49       Or like a, a woman experiencing sexual pleasure. It's like, okay, if it's like the dude, go ahead. But like not fan of a guy just down the girl having an orgasm. It's very not done.

Speaker 6:          00:55:59       Yeah. Right. Does it ever happen? Yeah. He never, you never said like the girl coming. So even if it's the guy, and it's usually like for Congress,

Speaker 4:          00:56:09       private parts and the girls, like on the speaker. Um, like having an orgasm. Right. Howard was making the noises and stuff. I remember that was so shocking when that came out. Like that was so, yeah. When that movie,

Speaker 6:          00:56:21       fuck yeah, that was hot. You're sitting on the speaker

Speaker 3:          00:56:24       and he's going to microphone. Yeah, that was, that was cool. That's interesting that it's not thought of as being very important if you come because it's all leftover barbarian shit and we used to hold you down by your hair and just shoot a load and you and run away. That's what it is. That's how people made babies back then. Let's grow. It is gross, but it's the reason why men are stronger than women. Why aren't you strong too? You're not strong too, so we can rape you easier. It's really that simple. There's no logical reason why you wouldn't be like [inaudible] tall. We're, we're stronger to fight off other men that want to fuck you and kill the babies. That's what we're strong. That's totally right. Strong to rape you and to fight off other men. It says you're supposed to be strong too. Why aren't you strong too?

Speaker 4:          00:57:06       Sky Is wrestle each other so they get off out of their system instead of trying to rape me.

Speaker 3:          00:57:13       [inaudible] haven't even considered Yo to, haven't even looked into this so deeply. They're scared because of social constructs. Right.

Speaker 5:          00:57:21       We had a Ras, if you're on his own podcast, had a gas that was addicted to going to bath houses or, I mean massage parlors. Yup. To get late. Did you see, did he say his name? No, no, no. All right. Okay. Do you have a mom with a mask on him yet? A Spiderman mask on. Oh yeah, dude. I almost said his name. Yeah, I know.

Speaker 3:          00:57:37       Yes. But anyways, that was close. Sorry. This is live. Maybe we should consider not having this line. Even Charlie Sheen edits to shit.

Speaker 5:          00:57:46       Uh, but so anyways, he, I never knew. Like I always heard the, the hand job thing where they say they say handhelds, but he was talking about how there's places here in la, many places that he can get just like fucking full on hooker sex. What? And he says that he's gotten to the point where he has places that has favorite places with his favorite. He's like, yeah, this isn't like an la 10 at this one place and it's $150 and you just fucking there sit there and fuck after you do a 15 minute massage. Whoa. And he says, he says and yeah, even bring out the women so they can look like the bunny ranch where they, they all call her and say hi and stuff like that. Wow. Massage Parlor.

Speaker 4:          00:58:18       Is there a thing where you can get a massage part of your sex massage at the end?

Speaker 3:          00:58:24       Yeah, like more relaxing the wind down. They give you a legit and massage and then they jerked you off at the end.

Speaker 4:          00:58:30       The massage at the end though, I'm crazy thing. Is that sterling? Yeah. Fast out the gate and then I would get like the wine down. Oh, I see. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:58:38       So you would go, wow, that's interesting for a guy. I think it's the opposite, right? Give me a massage first and then beat me off. Don't be, yeah. Yeah, cause actually beat me off. I just want to go away. Yeah, I'm done. See Ya. And I don't mean to massage. That's good. I feel good. I'm loose. He also got, when men have an orgasm, there's a fucking instinctive need that you have to overcome to just run, to come get away. It's true in real life, fucked the movies and real life. When a guy comes, I'm telling you he wants to run away. I mean you want to stay. If you will love your wife or your girlfriend and you, you know you have this relationship together. But if you don't, if you don't know each other that well, then all sudden you fucking like get me Outta here. What have I done? The snuggle. Snuggle. Sometimes,

Speaker 5:          00:59:22       sometimes if you really love the job, but there's a lot of times when you're not, there's a lot of times when you just want a raw,

Speaker 6:          00:59:30       especially if you're drinking, if you're drinking and you know that somehow or another, you've loud the alcohol and your penis to talk you into some unreasonable situation. And then as soon as you orgasm that it just becomes clear what the fuck happened. And then you want to run away, get me Outta here. So what I'm trying to say is it's way better to get

Speaker 5:          00:59:48       massage first. He loosens you up then drug. I'd be like, good, we're done. We're done here. We're done. Thank you. You also said that how he got an escort once and it was in this weird like small town. It was like three o'clock in the morning and uh, he, he, he only had two options and like on the Internet you've found like their websites and one the lady was already out doing something else, but the other one, you know like would show her eyes only and then it will like show like her leg or something like that cause it couldn't show the whole thing. And so he's like, fuck it, I am, I do this. And she had a really nice or you know, it seemed really nice on the phone or stuff. Then she comes over and it was like, she, she was just like, had to like stab wounds.

Speaker 5:          01:00:24       She like, her teeth were all fucked up and her voice sound like PJ Stansberry was like, hey, come over here and stuff like that. And he said it was so bad that like he felt like he, it was impossible to fuck this girl. So then he's goes, uh, yeah, I have this thing and I like to do, it's where you give me a blowjob, I put a blanket over you, why watch porn? And she's like, alright, you know, and then afterwards she's like, do you mind if I finish myself up? But you got me all hot and bothered and says he just puts one leg up over on and it just starts fucking masturbating. It's called skeptic tank to a rx. If you're a skeptic, take to a desk, squad podcasts. But listen to that, that's so sad.

Speaker 6:          01:01:03       Friend that has been addicted to go into those massage Polish forever and he's never had a girlfriend as long as I've known him. I've known him for more than 10 years and more than 10 years that I've known him all, all this guy does is he's a, he's not a very good looking guy. And he's, he's not built very well and he went bald really young in life and he's never been successful. Right. And just has a real hard time. He gets real nervous around checks. So he just goes, he's Asian massage place is, it just gets whacked off all the time. Yeah. So a good percentage of like, it doesn't make a lot of money. So the good percentage of what this guy makes every week goes to just getting whacked off. And then he takes them out on dates sometimes. He was talking to me about it once we were playing pool and he was talking to me about it. He's like, yeah, well, you know, I'm taking her on a date this Friday though. What you get. Oh, okay. All right. So like judge up Joe, I'm, no, no. I'm saying, do you think, is she going to be your boyfriend? Are you going to be her boyfriend? Like what's, what's going on? Like you guys get, yeah.

Speaker 5:          01:01:57       Um, romantic comedy, right. Wax Off dudes all day and then Thompson.

Speaker 6:          01:02:03       But I felt like I felt like the way he was telling me, it was almost like he had talked her into doing it cause she didn't want to lose him as a customer. Right. You know, times are tough, you know when you get that steady 700 a week coming from one dude, you know he's thinking about it. Do it himself like

Speaker 7:          01:02:20       every other day or something. Yeah. Kinda. He'd like to say fucking find a fat chick with a mustache and just be like, look, we can fuck each other once a week, but I have to get really drunk every time I do it. It's just like, okay, you can get jerked up by cute Asian girls. What are you talking about? It's ridiculous. Option. Plateaued on a higher human nature son. You're talking some unrealistic nonsense. It doesn't work that way. Right. That's right. Joe, back to you. And the traffic today is sponsored by flash lights. You totally can be like waiting for the entertainment tonight. Right now we've got you as a comic and we got, yeah. Yeah. Mary Hart got to light my legs real nice. Oh that's, you're right. It was her legs raise them up to this. He had a leg greaser for sometimes it seemed like, like sometimes it would go like Mary hearts legs were just like greasy, like she just signed Nana oil and shit like that. Yeah. Isn't that funny man?

Speaker 4:          01:03:16       Gosh, we're gonna have her own show. Yay.

Speaker 6:          01:03:19       Makes sense to you. Being a woman, being a woman, seeing like men like freaking out about body parts and zinc. Like that's all you need to like sell a car and some woman with slinky legs like folds them over and gets in the front seat. Yeah. Everybody wants to buy that fucking Cadillac. There's policy demand car. There's some crazy connection. What is it like though to be a professional woman? Like how to be a professional sex symbol? Like dudes are they, they look at you and 99% of them are thinking about sex. So thinking about sex that you've had and what you're selling.

Speaker 4:          01:03:51       If I wasn't in the business I'm in, I feel like people would probably look at me that way anyway. No. Yeah, because I'm always like, I'm trying to talk it out with my coworkers and stuff and I'm like, I think this guy just wants to fuck me because I'm a porn star. And then like men welfare, I looked at me and goes, no idiot. They want to fuck you because you're hot. And I'm like, oh, okay. Yeah. I can make up whatever backstory. Even if they've seen like uh, like a, a digital image on their computer or not. People can, like when you see a hot girl, you are, have

Speaker 7:          01:04:23       your whole, your imaginations run wild. If I worked with your team, everybody works. I would want to fuck you the whole time I was at. Right. Body works. Why would I work at I am not, I've just, this is information that I've acquired from my thesis. Is that what you said? You're being honest, but it's also very possible that he wanted to fuck you because he saw you fuck people on film. Right. I know. I've never watched, I've watched her fuck one time on film now. That's fine. Yeah. Was just,

Speaker 4:          01:04:52       you have to stop looking at me naked because we're friends now. That's just not the way that it goes. Funny. There's, there's no social taboo between you watching porn that I'm in just because we're friends.

Speaker 6:          01:05:02       A lot of people that I find important, it's kind of strange there. There's lines of the draw, you know, there's very distinct lines. Like I remember this couple that I met, we were doing the man show and this couple came on. They were talking about how they're allowed to fuck other people while they work. They're both in porn, but then off work, you're not allowed to just go random my fuck people. Right. And I was like, wow, that's a, that's a weird distinction. Like how do you, how do you figure that one out? I'll get your okay with him fucking whoever at work. But that was the other thing. Like one guy was on the set and his girlfriend started sucking this guy's Dick when the camera wasn't running. Right. He's like, Hey, what the fuck? And he got all mad.

Speaker 4:          01:05:37       How are we creating new? That's where I'm crazy is that he's like, fucking, you guys aren't even filming and she's just sucking his dick. What's up? What's up? I've actually, I've worked with people and to have the same kind of thing where it's like, uh, they can do whatever they want on camera, but the guy has to like stroke himself. He's like getting ready to go. Like the girl can't help it. Like there, it's like maybe they might be the same people. I don't know. Isn't that crazy? But yeah, it's just they're socially monogamous. Have a rule. There's a line that you draw. Well, I of fun. I used to date a guy in the business and outside of work we didn't fuck around or whatever. No. And he did some things that I found were questioning them all and he was, and he was like, there's a camera in the room.

Speaker 4:          01:06:20       And I was like, you're a fuck. That's fucked up. That's not the same thing. Right. Oh, that's hilarious. Yeah, just like one doesn't count. No, no, no. But I mean, it just, your, your boundaries are your own and it doesn't matter what you do for a living just because you're a comedian doesn't like, no one's allowed to tell jokes in my house besides, you know, just that's just not the way that life works. Right. Um, but you, if you have a, like some kind of contracts like marriage or you're, you're with somebody and you say, okay, well we live together now. So like I don't want you sleeping with other people even though I do porn for living. Do you know what I'm saying? It just, because that's what you've arranged between the two of you.

Speaker 6:          01:07:00       That's a weird thing though. Why Range? Anything? Why? Why make something that someone can't do? If you're allowing the most sacred of sacred things, you're allowing this person to fuck other people right on, on film. Why not just allow it to be themselves? Why put any boundaries just here, come here at night and, and this is where we live.

Speaker 4:          01:07:18       Cause I dunno if sex is not that sacred to some people. Maybe because maybe like the people that I work with, they don't have my address. Right. You know what I mean? And maybe that's a little bit more my privacy and my security is more sacred to me than the actual physical act of sex. That's true.

Speaker 6:          01:07:35       Right? Yeah, that's true. It's like pleasure. It's like, would you get mad every time you masturbated to the video or you know what I'm saying is why put a boundary on it though? Why put a boundary and not, not, not necessarily. I see what you're saying. What do you want to like letting people

Speaker 4:          01:07:47       Virgo and they were just, you know, they want things to be a certain way, you know,

Speaker 6:          01:07:51       in our realm of comparability. Do what the fuck they want to do and find someone who you're compatible with instead of trying to morph someone to your expectations. That's the number one problem with audible. Yeah. Meet people, find people that are incompatible with them when they try to make them fit and it doesn't fucking work that way. Right. One person is a control freak and the other person's anal and whatever,

Speaker 4:          01:08:10       they don't move. They don't want to do the thing that they've agreed that they don't want to do. You know, like it's not compatible what they've agreed like, yeah.

Speaker 7:          01:08:19       Negatives in there. [inaudible] they're compatibility.

Speaker 4:          01:08:26       Oh he that they both, you know, for what reason or another thing, it's okay to do porn, but outside of work they agree to sleep with only each other and they come to that together. That's definitely a compatibility.

Speaker 3:          01:08:37       Yeah. Good point. Yeah. If they're all agree, if it's not based on necessarily judgment or whatever, I'm not saying there's anything wrong with it. I'm just saying it's an odd thing that you don't have a boundary and someone fucking people on camera, but you do have a boundary with them doing it for pleasure on their own with another person.

Speaker 4:          01:08:56       Well, just because that might be emotional art is, or what,

Speaker 7:          01:08:59       right. It's, it's understood when you're, when you're fucking lame film. Exactly. Porn is acting and athleticism. Athleticism. What they're calling it these days. You should,

Speaker 4:          01:09:12       yeah. I'm a crazy person and you know, and it's not comfortable. It's, it's not for you. It's for the camera. It's, you know, it's, and it's hard to do something that does not feel good. Right. And Act like you feel like it feels good to, you literally get fuck sideways sometimes. It really fucking hurts it just,

Speaker 7:          01:09:28       do you ever stretch it out before shoots? You know, I do. I need to. I have like a huge butt butt hole. Mongo. Is it easy for you to Poop poop?

You, if you wanted to make warrior children, you'd be a good specimen for your children with flexible buttholes, you'd be, you have the perfect DNA for it. Yes.

Speaker 7:          01:11:46       Is it hard to, to, to be, to date people as a porn star, do you find or does, is it like more of a challenge? Yeah,

Speaker 4:          01:11:53       it depends on the person. I did it a guy a couple years ago and when we met, like he knew what I did and stuff like that and I did not want to be involved with him. And then

Speaker 4:          01:12:06       we started sleeping together after a really long time. We kind of like worn me down a little bit and then after that it was like kind of fucked up. It was, we weren't off to a good start. Um, I'll admit, but you know, I get bored too. Um, so after we like started dating or are fucking fucking in dating, he then like looked at porn that I was an and decided that he wanted to be a spazz about it and be like, I don't know, like knowing you do those types of things, I don't know. And I'm like, yeah, you already knew. But now that now you want to be bothered because you're a drama queen has nothing to do with what I do. It's just that, you know,

Speaker 7:          01:12:47       feelings were awesome feelings. We're also getting, you know, starting now, they'd be four. It was like zero feelings. I just want to fuck you now the now it's starting to cut, like love gets involved. You know? I think that's probably a Max

Speaker 4:          01:12:57       process of wearing you down. It's like I don't judge you like I think it's fine and it's like really great because you're really successful. And then I just kind of nose dived into like, ah, yeah, you do those things.

Speaker 6:          01:13:09       I think for a lot of men it's very important when they meet a girl that they're sexually attracted to, they want that girl liked them and I think that is the root of a lot of bullshit. And the guys don't even realize they're doing it. It's a genetic thing. It's a predisposition to wanting to be sexually attractive. And so they start pretending to be someone who they're not. And then they get into the relationship and then it's a couple months in and they're relaxed and comfortable and they're like, why am I with this crazy bitch? I don't even, I'm not even into this. And Yeah. Yeah. It's like there's a, there's a lot of dudes that are just trying to put it together. Like they don't have the luxury of like actually being honest and trying to like meet someone that they actually like, they're so caught up in the game of trying to fuck a chick and it's so difficult for them. Then when they finally get one they tackle or they get it in there. Yeah. They're like, ah, got one. Good. Okay. What did I pretend to be doing?

Speaker 7:          01:13:57       Do this. I'm not a fucking Vegan. I want us to start wearing the beads and stuff. You know, they meet a girl that's willing to fuck them like once every couple months. They got to work hard

Speaker 3:          01:14:12       to take it down so they pretend to be someone and not using plates. Just sex for lie. We, we do together is love. That's just

Speaker 4:          01:14:23       a movie you're making, right? Oh yeah. That same drama guy. He was like, yeah, I was like being really depressed or something like that. And he, he would like one of the lay it on me. Like, you can't live inside your own pain and I love you. And I was like, Huh,

Speaker 1:          01:14:39       get the fuck out. You're creeping me out. You can weird. I don't know where you heard that shit. Fuck out of you in here. This is something that you think, yeah, I was like, you're full of shit

Like, Oh God. It's such a, such a bummer. You know when you hear someone say some nonsense and then you have to mock them and then they get mad at you for Maka them and it all fucking falls apart. Oh, I used to date this girl who used to write poetry and it was nonsense. It was nonsense. It was, I mean it was her form of expression, but it was so clearly affected and fake and just designed to like fucking fire off all the rights and it was just so artificial, so clear, so clear that it was just a bullshit that she was slinging. It was so offensive. Or you a poetry snob though? Or do you like it just like high quality?

Speaker 3:          01:15:44       I love the counseling. You know what I love about Koski and you know, I mean it's a lot of his stores are like really dark is a little poem, but it's, that's a fuck with that guys thinking about for real. Yeah. That is his real life and switch thing on. That's all require of an artist with what inflames me is when I think someone is trying to pretend to be someone else, whether it's a human or a singer or a comedian or an actor. If I feel like you're bullshitting me, I feel like you're bullshitting me. It's offensive. Yeah. Read me. You're fucking crazy. Poetry Hooker, the felting tier intelligent. You're, you're mad at me that I'm laughing at this nonsense. That was a horror story from vit doing porn. What's, what's one thing that sticks out? Just you fucking like, just awful experience. Did you ever like say, okay, never again.

Speaker 4:          01:16:30       Um, I used to do a lot of like BDSM stuff where I was a sub.

Speaker 3:          01:16:35       That is, and I will get beat. Explain that to everybody who's not crazy. He DSM, most people don't have any idea what that means.

Speaker 4:          01:16:43       Bonded. Well, it's like sadomasochism s and M is sadomasochism. When you say a were the one that they tortured, sub submissive and dominant. So it's bondage and dominatrix. No, some shit like that. Yeah, it's like a code, I dunno. Whatever. Right. It's like being in the army. Yeah. Easy. Yeah. It's like the same things. You try to invent little short things of them.

Speaker 7:          01:17:25       oh my God. Like while in like very strict bondage and stuff like that. My God, Whoa, Whoa, whoa.

Speaker 4:          01:17:32       Challenging. You know? And it was something that was really legitimately interested in when I was in my early twenties and it's something that I thought that maybe, you know, so I consider myself to be a kind of a tough person and I felt like if I, if I've met these challenges, it would prove how tough I was. God Damn. Wow. Yeah,

Speaker 7:          01:17:50       I dunno it. Inside your pothole, what percentage of the population is ever been electric unit inside the there? I mean, they produce like the tens unit,

Speaker 4:          01:17:59       send the, I mean they're sold like as medical equipment and stuff like that. I'm sure a fair amount of people have gotten their hands on them,

Speaker 7:          01:18:06       you know? So I don't know. I don't have the numbers in front of me said, well let me stick this thing on my full battery on your asshole. [inaudible] when you're about to calm nine up your ass. Oh, iron man loads. You don't know though. Oh, I think I do have a penis. Makes the guy shoot longer, loads more experience with more penises. You don't know that. There's no more than willing to submit to you on those outfitting the entire room. Me. So how long did this whole session take? Weather electrocuting your vagina and your asshole

Speaker 4:          01:19:05       man. It was a first that called wired pussy.com. Yeah,

Speaker 7:          01:19:10       so it's all electric shooting pussies. There's a site female on female sub dom and the electric policies play like you play games, like who can take the most electricity

Speaker 4:          01:19:23       or they'll chase blindfolded and partially tied up women around with a cattle prod. That makes noise. And you could either go toward it or away from the sound, but if you go away from the sound,

Speaker 7:          01:19:33       just when I thought get in trouble, some of the darkness. Yeah, no, that's, that's where I started. That's where I stopped. Ever had your pee hole fucked. Whoa. There's videos out there of guys. Fucking girls is really small and it stretches just like your asshole. I'm very sensitive in my whole life. Don't, don't say never. You got to reach goals. You gotta you gotta of my body. I went through a phase of like piercing and stuff like that when I was younger. I did some tattoo above

Speaker 4:          01:20:08       the cookie. I do, but I'm having it removed and that is so fucking painful than any like butthole electrocution I've ever gotten. Really. Laser Tattoo removal is so painful. It, um, like agitate the Inca molecule and your skin and makes it explode. And with each treatment it just gets smaller and smaller and it grow. It metabolizes out of your body. Right? You have to wait a couple of months in between sessions just like long enough that you could forget how much fucking pain you are in. You have to go in and do it again. Fuck that.

Speaker 7:          01:20:40       I'm just keeping waterfalls. Just kissing it. Got An old tattoo. Tramp stamp. Yup. Yup. It's around my belly leading. I'm going to sleep on my right arm and I have an old tattoo up here that I have to get removed, go off just yet. Just get black black box. But it's just black flag. How much, how much worse is it than the actual tattooing?

Speaker 4:          01:21:01       So much worse because you have to go like 20 times and it mines and it's like just like a very, uh, it's like you could feel like the impact of the laser going into your skin. It feels like being snapped to the rubber band really hard. It instantly burns that it makes your skin swell up and lot. Why when you get a tattoo, it's kind of scratches the surface of your skin. When you get lasered, it's like effecting the color inside your skin. So the blood kind of seeps out like a sponge.

Speaker 7:          01:21:31       No, I'm going to, I'm going to wait for technology to get a little bit better. He just turned me the fuck off. Don't do it. And thinking about cooking my arm like that, I'm like, what am I doing? Like that you could damage your skin, right?

Speaker 4:          01:21:44       No, I mean it's safe. It doesn't scar. Doesn't know that. I mean that's the purpose of it being such a long, slow process. I mean, you could just cut it off if you wanted to, but I wouldn't say that that's the best idea ever.

Speaker 7:          01:21:56       Right. So let me ask you this. And wired pussy.com calls you up next week and says, Hey, we're looking to do a shoot. And you're done with that. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          01:22:02       Yeah. I would top, I've, I've gotten back to be the dom. It's a portrait girls from snapchat because I feel like I can confidently say I know what I'm doing and I wouldn't do something to somebody else that I haven't had done to myself, but I know what it feels like. I know. And if they're not a bad ass bitch like me, then they don't get to fuck me. Would you ever do far porn? Yeah. Yeah. For all the time and my movies in your movie, it's just like when you get fucked in the ass, like your butt is open and gaping is like the big thing where they want to see, they want to see her lower colon, they want to see it all in age 13 I don't know why people like it, they just do and I, you know, and just whatever. So like the air, it goes into your calves out and then you have to kind of fight it out and not look I far like I'm eating can of beans like a Hobo.

Speaker 7:          01:22:49       Right, right. My farts on fire accidentally ever sprayed?

Speaker 4:          01:22:53       No, no. I think I've, I've accidentally peed on people at work and then be like, I'm squinting or whenever. And I dunno what is squirting exactly. Is it really when in the movies, girls like shooting. All right. Obviously you can see it coming out of her pee hole. Right? I'm, I'm assuming that a lot of people that watch these movies don't know what a vagina looks like or anything and they don't know that where the, all the liquid shooting out of the girl's vagina area or her, her love zone or whatever nerves call it. Yeah.

Speaker 7:          01:23:26       But isn't that he, hey, but hold on a second because that's where it would come out anyway because isn't a pee hole like literally like when a woman gets her testosterone treatment, it become a man. Her clit grows. I become like a small penis, Pussy Boehner and that the penis is obviously where any sexual ejaculate would come out of. So of course it's going to come out of where you pee.

Speaker 4:          01:23:44       I don't know.

Speaker 7:          01:23:45       What is it? Is it real? I mean this is did I used to date a girl that fucking juiced on me and it was like in my belly button, like a puddle and it was, it wasn't p though. It was just, it was like,

Speaker 4:          01:23:56       because a broth, you know when the woman's vagina gets moist, it's not dripping over pee hole. It's coming from inside. I don't think this is moistened it's not lubricant. That's, that's what squirting is supposed to be. And when you'll see it coming out of the pee hole

Speaker 7:          01:24:15       p Whoa. Yeah. That it was supposed to in a lot of times where you see like

Speaker 4:          01:24:19       Spiderman like trick that they do when they like finger the pussy and I like press like on the outside of the man. So he does his web. Yeah. This is like the axle Bron method. I watched instructional videos and I was like, what are they doing? And they're basically just like pushing on the bladder and just forcing people to come out. Jesus Christ. Yeah. And then just exactly what it is. Like if you had to force piano somebody, that's exactly how you would do it. Wow.

Speaker 7:          01:24:46       So that's what all that's spraying is. So there is, yeah. So girls are spraying on dudes. They're pissing all over him.

Speaker 4:          01:24:51       Yeah. Unless they have like an extra juicy g spot or something like that. Like I'm not going to say like, I'm not going to say female ejaculation is a myth because I'm not a doctor and I can't say that. I mean and you know, put these get wet and some pussies are wetter than others. Yeah.

Speaker 7:          01:25:10       We're talking to an expert here. Dan D Armaun here. 11 I'm not a doctor. Not a doctor all in. Now can you put, can you put a condom on a dick with just putting it in your mouth and doing that trick? I cannot even remember the last time I used a condom. God Damn. Wow. Do you ever worry about diseases?

Speaker 4:          01:25:25       No. I get tested every three weeks. Yeah.

Speaker 7:          01:25:28       So how do you keep clean when you're just, everybody gets tested every three weeks, right? Then you have three weeks for a porn star though. Jesus Christ. How many you don't do like, sorry. Dick's can you be exposed to like I worked with mark would twice last week. So it's like the same, same wiener, same, same wiener. Same Week. You guys develop like a relationship when you have like on screen?

Speaker 4:          01:25:52       Yeah. Uh, I mean I think the people I work with are cool. It's not like I'm like, Ooh, like I'm so horny for you. Let's do things after that. How many of them long? He's married Francesco Lay, you know, and they were fucking awesome. And I know both of them. I've worked with both of them.

Speaker 6:          01:26:07       Dudes that are in porn wanted to do mainstream things. We couldn't make it and have like some sort of a weird thing where they, I don't know.

Speaker 4:          01:26:14       It seems to be like a lot of guys are musicians and they're all like trying to get together like a band with all the other dude's Dick. Yeah. Soon as you call it, that'd be a bad ass name for a band playing and Dick Dick. I mean I don't, maybe I'm uh, I dunno. Maybe I'm just like, Oh, I'm at work, I'm doing my work things. But I didn't really ask people too much about their particular with Tyler night. Yeah. Tyler was a very good friend of mine. We were actually just both on Star Trek, the next generation. Oh really? A triple x parity digital says in revelation snacks coming soon. And that was like a bitch. He was Jordy. Yeah. And I was, she's a huge star trek fan. I'm a nerd. I was stoked. I called my dad and I was like, I'm reading for the part of Ensign Rao for the star trek parody. And he was like, that's so cool. And I was like, no dad, if I don't get this part, I'll die. Like super seriously. Like, no, I need, this has to be my part or I'm freaking out.

Speaker 6:          01:27:10       Tyler is a friend of mine from Jujitsu and he's a really good writer. Have you ever read any of this stuff? No. He's got a blog online and he's very smart. He's such a cool guy.

Speaker 4:          01:27:21       He's smart and he's very polite.

Speaker 6:          01:27:23       Yeah, he's very well spoken. He was on the podcast, but we had him on and he's a very, he's a fascinating dude, but I already knew that from talking to him at Jujitsu and stuff, but his writing is great. Really interesting stuff. And his writings about the porn business, he's got this one story that he wrote about a gang bang that is, she's like, you fucking feel the loads on the floor. Like as you're reading it, you feel like the sticky room, you feel the heat of all these guys behind him. He does a masterful job of describing this fucking incredibly Gonzo bizarre film that they're doing there. The me, you would get paid 50 bucks and you wait in line. You're like one of a hundred guys waiting to, you know, and you're jerking yourself off as you're getting up to this girl who was just covered in loads. There's loads all over the ground. Everywhere you walk there's loads, right?

Speaker 4:          01:28:08       It's just like slippery and wet. You're stepping, become everywhere, clothes, everywhere you go. There's this little signs that say slippery when wet that they have to put up around the woman. Who's the first person

Speaker 6:          01:28:21       do that. Was it Houston? Was she the first or the week before was probably before I was born because the numbers keep going up, you know, at one point in time it was like the,

Speaker 4:          01:28:28       the most people and I think she had sex with like 200 Annabella Chong

Speaker 6:          01:28:33       and she's got a, it's a fascinating documentary and like you, she's very intelligent. She's very unusual. Um, she was, uh, I think she was a student at Ucla. I might be wrong, Ucla or USC, but she was like, she's an intelligent person and she just had this weird desire to test the boundaries of, of Er, you know, acceptable sexuality by doing a gang bang film. But it was really interesting. Like it was a, it was cause it was, you know, they're really like got into her, her psychology

Speaker 3:          01:29:02       and who she is and like thought this is a complex sort of a fucking case where this woman wants to experience the ultimate taboo. You know

Speaker 4:          01:29:10       and my agent called me one time when he was like, what's the most number of coffee all back and one like one time and I was like I don't fucking care, you know. And he was like, no. How about 11 I was like hi. And like what difference does it make if I fuck 11 dudes and the same day or in pairs of you know one's two's and three's on

Speaker 3:          01:29:33       I have to like the third or fourth giant black cock. You're numb lips when started getting numb. No.

Speaker 4:          01:29:38       In your head though is 11 cock days. That same amount of time

Speaker 3:          01:29:42       when you stretch your mouth. I don't like that shit. Would that seems like it would make your lips number? Yeah, the huge mouth. I do have a huge one. It's good for my career comes in handy. Now did you know that you wanted to be a porn star when you were younger or is this

Speaker 4:          01:29:54       no, I, I did. I actually did like part of this as like a bit of a with the midnight show go guys. They did this your life. Bob Guccione the midnight show guys. What is it? The UCB. Okay. You know, how, how redneck and stuff.

Speaker 8:          01:30:10       And um,

Speaker 4:          01:30:13       I was like, oh, this is your life Bob. Guccione and, and I come out and I'm like, Oh, I've been such a big fan of you for forever and stuff. Um, because when I, with, uh, like in the first grade, probably six years old, I found a stack of playboy magazines that were in the woods. [inaudible] they were my uncles. My uncle stayed with us part time hours, you know, they were just like out in his room. And I, and I remember I took, I took one of those magazines to school all to first grade and I was like, this is what a naked lady looks like. You know, I was like such a boy. I was at a tomboy when I was that age, but I, but even then I was like, this is like what a sexy lady looks like and I want to grow up and this is, you know, I want to turn out like this sexy lady. Like that's kind of like, that appealed to me. I thought, wow, she's, she's gorgeous. She's all made up, she's, you know, pretty and naked, thin, nice boobs, you know. And I was like, yeah, that like really appealed to me. From your room

Speaker 3:          01:31:16       girls before you started doing movies.

Speaker 4:          01:31:18       Yeah. And I, and I also thought like if I'm, if I don't turn out to be this, I had like a fail safe in my brain. I was like, if I don't turn out to be a sexy lady, I would at least want to be it with one, like have one like us, my girlfriend or like just, you know, be in the presence of that because it was appealing to me and I found it attractive. Hmm. I'm a gay, I came on your show because I want to say that I'm out a big pussy Boehner and I have a placebo owner and I take it.

Speaker 3:          01:31:52       So how did you get into your first film? How did it come and get a hold of you?

Speaker 4:          01:31:57       I shoot seven years, seven years, 24 when I got in and I'll be 32 inches. Before that I was a stripper. I was a drunk stripper too.

Speaker 6:          01:32:08       And how did, what did someone approach you and say, Hey, I like the way, yeah,

Speaker 4:          01:32:11       no, absolutely not. No, actually quit drinking. I think I already told this story on your show. Maybe I quit drinking and I got fired from being a stripper and I had been thinking about applying to this porn site because at fucking machines on it, and this is how I got into the business. I just have sure like morbid curiosity of fucking a robot and just really thinking about it. And he's like masturbate in the shower, right

Speaker 7:          01:32:40       in a robot and a robot on the inner. I heard it too. Totally. And I heard it's awful, by the way. What was your experience like? Fucking Michigan. A lot of fun to talk to girls. It's fucked. Robots actually talked about it today. No joke. Really bad. It comes up all the time for the face that people feel like they can approach you and talk about fucking robot. Seems like the guy gotta be in it and you were really kind of in a nerdy thing, one of those spaces.

Speaker 4:          01:33:06       So yeah, I just ended up applying to that site. And that's how I got to do all that bondage stuff is because it's the same company ran hog tied and wired pussy and all these holes and they even have a female wrestling say ultimate surrender where they have women wrestling. They,

Speaker 7:          01:33:20       the market cornered on kinky pain shit. Yeah, absolutely. Wow. What a weird business. Zimmer by the armory up in San Francisco, they, it's basically like a castle. You know what I saw that online or on a television show,

Speaker 6:          01:33:33       whether there was some sort of an expo say on it about how much money they make and how big their businesses enormous.

Speaker 4:          01:33:38       But they also, they really improve that neighborhood. They give back to their community. They do a lot of stuff. Um, you know, they, they open their uh, Joel Court to, uh, you know, when they have parades and shit. Like people can set up their floats. They opened their, their private business to the community to do things or have swap meets inside there.

Speaker 7:          01:33:58       So Nasco,

Speaker 4:          01:33:59       it's like a crazy jungle of naked people running around and like

Speaker 7:          01:34:02       fucking right, like the people in offices, like on computers. San Francisco's

Speaker 6:          01:34:08       as a place where that would be accepted in San Francisco's, in my opinion, it's the most open minded city and the whole,

Speaker 4:          01:34:13       you'd be surprised there were in the Wall Street Journal I'm talking about like people are there, we know there's people fucking in there and yeah.

Speaker 7:          01:34:19       What does it matter? There's always going to be some people like that, but the amount of people that were sick, where do you think their neighbors came from?

Speaker 6:          01:34:26       Well that would support, it would be much larger in San Francisco than anywhere else. Of course you're always going to come across people that are very vocal that one of the fight something, but all in all San Francisco is the most open minded city, I think in the whole country.

Speaker 4:          01:34:39       Hmm.

Speaker 7:          01:34:41       Steady on that. I mean, could you imagine that happening? Sure.

Speaker 6:          01:34:44       Cargo where there's a whole block filled with people that are tying people up and fucking them with rubber robots and shit.

Speaker 7:          01:34:50       You know, that can only take place in like San Francisco. Yeah. I don't think there's any other place that could, that would accept something like New York maybe. I mean, it seems like New York

Speaker 3:          01:34:58       has a lot of fucking of the bondage clubs, New York and La, or would it be only other options? I think, and I think that'd be met with a lot more resistance in New York. La, Europe. Yeah. Anywhere. Yeah. Berlin, Budapest. Who was in, um, uh, Berlin and I turned on the television and um, no, not Berlin. Oberhausen Oberhausen and I turned on the television and there was no gang bang on TV. Just a full on gang bang. Let's just, no warning. Just flipping through the channels. Wow. The, yeah, there's 10 people fucking in a room. I'm like, wow, this is wild. Like they have a totally different attitude about it. They just show the Shit on television. It's pretty intense. What are you doing it right? Looking at, I just looked at the basis for Alice in chains died when Mike Star, I don't know. Yeah. So you don't care. He was on celebrity rehab. I don't know if you remember him. They found his body in Salt Lake City.

Speaker 7:          01:35:53       Well, Charlie, Shane lives winning. He doesn't have tiger blood. I don't know. I'm a Tanish DNA, just not a freaking rock star from Mars. Well, I guess that guy probably didn't have to pay girl $30,000 to have sex with them either. Is probably has. He's got a lot of money. Shit, I don't make things happen. He's a rockstar. Tracing is Charlie's Socom doughy like slippery sweaty guy with five kids. Charlie, Charlie Sheen. I would rather pick a rock star then like somebody has fucking five kids. But the crazy thing is the Charlie Sheen calls himself a rock star, but he's on this. I like forgot that he was like the longest

Speaker 3:          01:36:33       family Sitcom, you know? I mean it's like this really bland, you know, kind of do it out to the walk. You know? There's no edge to it. The egg, like really vanilla, you know? And it's, yeah, it's the number one comedy. For some reason I talked to my friend today, he's watches it every week and I'm like, really? You Watch that show

Speaker 7:          01:36:50       Charlie Sheen? And like a gay guy?

Speaker 3:          01:36:52       Yeah, yeah. But he's like, well, it's like, it's the exact same show every week, you know? It's like the same premise every week, but he's like, it's, it's, it's one of those shows you could just kind of watch, you know, and it's easy to watch is smooth and smooth and it's funny enough. Well, you know what man? I mean reality television has proven that you don't really need to be that funny to get people to watch it. Yeah. You just need to, people people need, it needs to come a part of their everyday existence. They get like, let's see what's going on. And ice road truckers, shit. The boys are on a slippery road. Again, it becomes an ice road. Truckers, there's a show about slippery roads. Yeah, I mean, and if that can exist, you can have a show about anything and a sitcom that's like been around for awhile. It's fairly decent. It's got a few good laughs in it, but I bet for Charlie Sheen it's like he's smoking coke and banging horse and then he's going and doing this super bland television show. I bet that built up inside of him. I bet that like made him go more over the edge. His character was pretty much himself though in the, in that show. I mean, it might've been a vanilla. She'll be, he still was a drunk guy that just fucked a bunch of chicks. I mean, it

Speaker 7:          01:37:55       was like, it wasn't, he wasn't really off his wrote a little sure. No, no, no. Sure. It was, what can he acts like? Oh yeah, you're gonna see Petunia Wall Street trolley. She didn't get out of his fucking ass off. I didn't see Charlie Sheen back motherfucker when he was young man. Does he? Yeah. He's at the office and he's like, he's like the really hot guy that's in trouble and the girls there with them, she's original nose and she's all excited about them. Yeah. What was the movie that Charlie could have kept that knows, right? Yeah. There wasn't a bad, it's just that's your nose hooker. What was the movie that Charlie Sheen shots. He was in scary. You might do three or four. Yeah. What was the move that he tried to play a played himself, but it played like him, like he was friends with the main character. Anything get a John Malcovich. Yes. John Malcovich. That was an awesome

Speaker 3:          01:38:43       a cameo with him in it. Do you remember that? No. Badly. As far as I can tell, it closes itself, I think. Yeah, I dunno. Charlie Sheen, you see platoon, he's about him on the phone. She Wall Street. All fucking good. You know what holds up dude? What? Silence of the lambs holds the fucker. Yeah, I watched silence of the lambs Hila night. It's a good goddamn movie still. It's still holds up in the basket. Yeah, it's good man. It's, it's, it's well written. It's well do girl. Dude. Fucking Anthony Hopkins was a bad mother fucker in that movie still. You know, he's become like this guy who does like these movies. It's sock. You played the Wolf Man, Dad. You know what I mean? The wolf man. Dad Demon

Speaker 7:          01:39:24       in every movie. You didn't see the wolf man? No, but there's also in Super Mario brothers. It wasn't, he was in something fucking retarded like that.

Speaker 3:          01:39:32       Even in the wolf man, which is a terrible movie. He's still like, has these scenes, these moments where he's just this bad motherfucker. He just, he just doing crappy ass movies, but you go back to silence of the lambs and you realize what he's capable of. If he gets a good script, if he gets a good part, Anthony Hopkins just smashes it out of the ball half that Mu fucking smashes it. Dude. He's so on like it crackles like it makes you nervous for her while she's talking to him like you fucking believe a 100% that dude has murdered in his mind when he's talking and he's talking to Anthony Hopkins is thinking about eating her. He's thinking about cutting up. He's allowing himself to go to some crazy dark place where he's acting, where you could tell like, that's really what he's fucking thinking about, man.

Speaker 3:          01:40:18       He could turn it on. He can go to that dark, crazy, psychotic, worst case scenario, human example. He can go there and his mind. That's the difference, man. It's just like comedy, man. It's like you, you, you have to really be fucking thinking about what you're saying. There's not just the words and the noises that represents certain things to me. I got to know that you're thinking about these things as you're saying them, you know, and that's the difference between a great performance and a performance that's just kind of mediocre and can trick dummies. You know, if someone's really nailing it.

Speaker 7:          01:40:49       I told her 22 year old actor that just got here from La. I was like acting as pretending like you don't

Speaker 4:          01:40:54       know what you're going to say next. And he got so offended and he ended up moving back to Tennessee.

Speaker 3:          01:40:58       You can't take the heat, stay out of the kitchen, bitch. Listen, if that's all that set, this fucking kid off. I bit on porn, start telling them that acting is fake. I've always said that if you can lie, you can act and if you could lie to a crazy girlfriend, you can act under pressure. It's not that hard. It's just pretending. The hard thing is auditions. Auditions are way harder because you're, you have to pretend that it's happening when you're in this really unrealistic scenario. You're sitting in his office and there's people in desks, chairs, and they're facing you with paper in their hand. They're reading off the paper and you're responding like it's really like this is just, I'm good that you like, this is just too strange. It just doesn't, it doesn't ring real to me.

Speaker 4:          01:41:37       I don't really do well on those types of scenarios. Have you done any three d movies for real? Yep. Yeah, I just did three powerhouse movies. And how did they, do they, how do they differ from like doing regular moves? Do they make you do weird angles? Like you have to spread your lips out towards the cameras or something disrobe or something. You have like sort of throw your clothes toward the camera or kind of like put like one leg off the bed, like cut and tangling toward the camera or something. So what about

Speaker 3:          01:42:02       guy shoot loads? Do they shoot them at the camera? I don't, I don't really notice. I'm like kind of like in the zone. The building, we'd have a pillow behind you. You don't want to smash your head on the headboard

Speaker 4:          01:42:13       to be like eight feet away for, for the three d effect to work. Right. So you gotta you gotta like clearly you've never seen very far away. Hmm. Never seen the distance very, very far. What about some do, what did some dude's eat like Peter North and what does that guy eat? So much sperm. So ridiculous supplements. Is that what it is? Zinc and I remember my boyfriend told me also PC exercises like the muscle that you use, like Stop Your pee. Oh right. You know like, like a key goal. Like a woman has a keigo muscle, like the PC muscles. What guys have I guess and apparently if you just do that a lot, it can strengthen the muscle and you'll shoot further. Yeah,

Speaker 3:          01:42:51       that's in it right now. Practice it. Some people just drink egg white egg whites. Yeah. It looks like loads. Loads will come out more type shit. Yeah. Yeah. That's probably the logical man. It's probably some placebo effect. Right? It's like the secret but with loads, yes. Secretly did it on your vision board you believe hello the longest load ever. What do you think is the furthest anyone's ever shoot a load? Because I remember hitting hit myself in the face once when I was 16 and being shocked that it's shut off and I pulled out and you know my, my high was down. I was looking at it last me right in the face. Don't do that. I make it rain all the time. Like I fucking why is this squirting on my forehead out of nowhere really far. Like what's the furthest anybody's ever shot a load? Spiderman was the furthest is even five feet. I would be more, I would say so I to be able to arc? No, it depends on like if there's a headwind how long your Dick is. Cause he guy like you know, some giant Dick John Holmes type would have a massive advantage. Yeah. He's got a six inch reach advantage. It's like John Jones as long arms loses some pressure going through with that launch mood. I like the way you're thinking scientifically. Yeah. I like

Speaker 4:          01:44:03       but maybe a shorter barrel

Speaker 3:          01:44:06       you got it makes sense. Right? Like a 38 special but it seems like a rifle would be much more accurate. Right? Yeah. Here's a little tip, by the way, if you put it a little bit of green again, just the bumps out with like Saint Patty's Day, you know Saint Patty's Day, this is awesome. St Patty's, they put a little bit of green of food coloring, render dick before you have stacks. And when you shoot out it actually is green. Yeah, that's good. And what if you make a baby and it's fucking looks like the Hawk baby cause I could asshole. What have you ruined the baby? What if it gets to the SPERMATOZOA and the spermatozoa get some crazy green signal and shoots it into the egg and some under the kid becomes great. How would be fucking awesome? I wonder if it's ever happened before. I mean, I mean if any, not that, but I mean if anybody's ever like done something where like the kid came out of funky color because of that. Yeah. Hmm.

Speaker 4:          01:44:49       The fear that people will probably been tricked to think that like maybe a white woman having a half black baby

Speaker 3:          01:44:56       recessive gene back in the old days. Right. That's the story of Jesus. Right? I mean the story of Jesus most likely is it marries a whore, right? That's the story of Jesus, right? Immaculate consumption. Right? It's come on bitch. Yeah. What kind of crazy shit is this? But back then in the biblical days, you just had to accept it. Maybe she was raped by one of those strong men. Maybe she'll want to rape her. She asked you dressing like that fucking robes. I see you wrote it, but she got a dirty ass too, and back then the only lived to be like 30 days. You got to get your rapings in. Why you could, oh my gosh, this is horrible. You guys listen, you had an electric charge inside your asshole. This is horrible. Oh, it's very so as this conversation, yeah, we've all agreed to be here and so these people who have agreed to today, I don't know, 2,360 of them right now are regretting it.

Speaker 4:          01:45:48       Oh, you guys

Speaker 3:          01:45:49       cool. No, that's cool. That's a lot of people. It's actually going to be a lot more than that one. She wanted to hold thing watching this right now. You've done other podcasts before, right? You've done some do you do Marin's to death squad

Speaker 4:          01:46:00       Marin? I just did a the Nerdist podcast.

Speaker 3:          01:46:03       Oh, see you're, that's what's fascinating about you. It's like as far as like girls that are in your business, you're much more known for your personality than any of the other ones. And I think a lot of it is those videos that you do, you know where you break the Adam Sandler video, you're breaking things down. Yeah. Like what else did you have a mail bag? We read people's emails or respond to them. I space

Speaker 4:          01:46:21       when I, when my space was before it was like just a spam graveyard. I would get like this really super heinous hate mail that was so just so many different levels of wrong and rude and misspelled and English and English. Yeah. Just like really mean like I have you get fucking cancer in your brain and dive aids cause you're a whore and you should accept Jesus in your life. And it was like, that makes no sense, right? Jesus Christ

Speaker 3:          01:46:50       would not fucking waste his time to wish me dead of AIDS and cancer. Like try to help you out. You Fuck Jesus Christ. Ignorance as well. There's a lot of that out there. You know when you're allowed to be anonymous. It's a very unknown, normal situation. It's an unnatural situation in human behavior. We're supposed to like we, we, we get rewards and we get pleasure and we get all this from interacting with each other. But when you're interacting with each other completely anonymously through like wires and it's all ones and zeroes, dude, I get it all day. Get it every day on Twitter. It was always some douchey due to so something and I'm just block them like I'm not, I don't have time. I'm not gonna argue with you so we can't spare followers and have 237,000 something that I would rather have one that falls me.

Speaker 3:          01:47:41       That's nice. Let's say 280 million people want it to be cons. I would stop being on Twitter. You know? It's fun though. The, the cool people way, way, way outnumber the shitheads. Yeah. And like you get like really cool interacting. Like last night I wrote on Twitter that that Charlie sheen was reminded me of hunters Thompson, the way he's talking and I said we were right outside of Barstow and the drugs began to take hold and then I got like hundreds and hundreds of tweets of people quoting hunters Thompson lines from the book. It was fucking great. It was really good. Let's get down to brass tax, how much for the ape and they just kid just kept coming over and over again. I'm like, this is fucking awesome. Like this is like a really interesting thing to interact with like minded people.

Speaker 3:          01:48:23       I have a message board and I want you to be a part of it because you would fit in like a fucking love. It's a great message board and it's all psychos and Weirdos and your moderator board. It's on Joe Rogan. Dot. Now we'll make you a rock. I'll make you a moderator for sure. We need more women. We only have like a couple of women moderators. I've got to make sure that you can, you can handle it. At first, you can't snap and go crazy. Yeah. You can't get a mortgage to people. It's not worth it. But when people are Douche bags, I send them to the retard room. I have two rooms I have like, well one is like the main, the main forum you can go to. There's a combat sports for flick MMA stuff. And then there's a, um, uh, a regular forum and then there's a podcast form and then there's special ed.

Speaker 3:          01:49:01       And Special Ed is if you're a douchebag, if you act like a shithead, you're stupid. Yeah. You want to insult people all the time for no reason. Get in the fucking toward been dummy. Yeah. But because of that, we've established a pattern and accepted like levels of communication and everybody's really cool there. It's a fascinating fucking shit. Yeah. And fascinating fucking shit comes out of there. You know, there's so many interesting, there's this story that I read on there the other day about these new fun guy that they found in the Amazon rain forest that turns ants into zombies, takes over the ant's brain. Horrible. Anyway. Well that's why they're there. They're there to to keep the amp population of bay. This fungus grows inside of dance body wires right out of its head, grows out of its head after it's dead was

Speaker 7:          01:49:48       a amp juice out of it. It also causes other ants to cannibalize. They cannibalize each other and the, there's four different types of them and then when one bullet ant will find that this fungus has infected, they will have their own way and take a deep into the woods. Even in the jungle. No, it's like they, they know what the fuck does. A fascinating shit on life narrated by Oprah Winfrey. Really. I think the, I think that was, it was like the generic version of planet earth. Okay.

Speaker 6:          01:50:14       Badass bitch. I was watching, I watched the Oprah network fascinating to me. I watched it the other day. Yeah. I got a TV in my gym and I was working out in the gym. I was on the window and I was watching the Oprah network and I was watching her. She was just that. She was considering whether or not you should have Nadia [inaudible] on our show, whether they should help her and they decided to get someone to come on and help her financially help her answer. Interesting. No, it's interesting. Elixia into Oprah like how she talks and how she thinks like you get behind that woman like she's like, she really is all about reaching out and helping people be the best person they they they can be and love. Like that's really what she's into it, right? Like it's so easy to criticize her. It's so like the Cliche, she's on TV all the time, you know? She's, it's like she's an easy target but when you look at like what she does, like she is bad mother fucker. Yeah, sure.

Speaker 7:          01:51:04       Oprah is like, everyone would hate the shit out of her if she was like with the amount of money that she has, if she was, if she was like being like Charlie Sheen is, people would be like fuck you, you black bench. I got this bitch life. Imagine if she was talking about that rock star. Like, I'm like a freaking rock star from Mars with my friends. If anybody's a rock star from Mars, it's Oprah. You know what I mean? She has some man that's just like in the shadows and shuts his whole that God isn't even talking less spoken to Steadman sits around and waits. He waits three paces behind her and he doesn't say shit unless she asks him a question. I bet Oprah has a very big area anymore. Yeah. I don't think they are. Kale finally forced it out. Yeah, I think that full Gail. That's the, that's the rumor, right? That's what's up. That's cool. I mean the, the Odin station has like a bunch of gay friendly,

Speaker 6:          01:51:58       they had a great show the other day. I was on the Oprah network and it was all about transsexuals. Yeah. It was a very eye opening man to look into it. Cause I have a friend whose son is, uh, becoming a transsexual. Um, his son is about to change from Amanda to a woman. And it's really strange because it sounds about the change for a man to a woman and his son is like into girl still, so sun is like becoming a lesbian. Very, very bizarre. And he's going to go apparently, I don't know if he's going to go through the operator, I don't know what the entire full story is, but they had this whole show dedicated to it and they had some kids, I mean there was a boy that was like a little boy. Okay. He looked like he was like seven or eight years old and he was wearing a dress and he wanted to be a girl know and I'm like, whoa. Like

Speaker 7:          01:52:43       does the younger you start, the more convincing you be if you

Speaker 4:          01:52:46       just avoid going through the whole male puberty thing, you stand a chance of being a more convincing women after your transition.

Speaker 6:          01:52:52       Yeah, maybe. I mean if you can really be sure of your choice at that young an age, but it's God, you talked to the parents and it's like very convincing what they're saying. It's not like it's so easy. If you're a normal gender oriented,

Speaker 4:          01:53:05       you're like seven years old and you're like, I'm challenged, I'm transgender. It's not a phase. It's not a fucking,

Speaker 6:          01:53:12       I agree with you, but who knows if it's a part of what's going on as you're young and then as your hormones kick in as you become 18 and 19 maybe. See, no, I'm just a gay man. You know? Maybe. Maybe it's like that simple. Maybe like you have transitioned straight man. Right. What I'm saying is I don't, I don't think you should really necessarily be fucking with your hormones until they settle in. I mean, I can understand someone being a grown adult and saying, okay, I want to be a woman. I've faked this long too long. This is what I want to do. But when you're a child, shit, I don't even know what the fuck I was gonna I mean, God, could you imagine if you had a chance,

Speaker 4:          01:53:44       you know, like that's probably normal for straight dudes. You know, what, if I turned out to be like a completely straight person, I probably wouldn't have been like lusting over nudie magazines and like showing them to people and being like thank you have to cut a little gay change like a little gay gay girl. When you were talking about

Speaker 6:          01:54:02       children, I think you have to account for change, you know, I'm not saying you should completely dis this, you know, just credit the idea that this is really a girl trapped in a boy's body, but I'm saying you have to account for changes like as far as like adding to their body and stuff like that. Seems like a really radical choice. And one of these kids was like 10 years old,

Speaker 4:          01:54:20       crazy medicine and their kids and there's like whatever, you know kitty pro. Right. You know, which is another fascinating good. It's better. I think it was, would it be better if a child was like, I know this about myself and instead of like some going, my kid is unreasonable. Like because they let the TV babysit it and then pump your kid full over the lend because they're hyper, they're just maybe undisciplined.

Speaker 6:          01:54:43       They used to live down the street that was riddling up their kid and it was [inaudible].

Speaker 4:          01:54:46       That's probably fucking your kid up more than listening to them when they tried to identify their sexuality or their gender, right?

Speaker 6:          01:54:51       The kid was on a bad kid there. The parents were terrible. They were terrible. A parenting and the kid was lost and the kid always seemed to me like they just wanted someone to tell them what was up, give them a hug, tell them what was that they did. There were two of the most lost kids ever because their parents were a fucking holy wreck right here. Would yell at each other in public and it was just a disaster. And they started picking their kids up and it was like I was living next door to zombies. It's like looking at us like did the Zombie, but these people have been taken over by spores, I mean that those pills might as well be the fucking spores that Jack those ants. Right. The same thing it just takes, so it's a chemical thing that happens to a kid where it takes over their brain, rewires it and makes them think and behave totally differently. And then all of a sudden these kids were like these little slap jobs on base. I was like, wow, they don neuter their fucking kids brains. Yeah. Yeah. You know, it's fucking crazy. Crazy how easy it is to have that sort of, that, that sort of power to just do that to your kids. I know to another person, I know his kid

Speaker 3:          01:55:44       is not fucked up and he's got his kid on some sort of riddle and shit because his kids too active

Speaker 7:          01:55:48       cause his kid is fucking alive and they're older. They didn't have the kid until they were like in their 50s they adopted them. They can't keep up at all. So they have this fucking can't medicate it. We want to treat him to the stove, whatever kid is nothing. It's nothing wrong with this kid. I've talked to him. He's just a wild little motherfucker.

Speaker 3:          01:56:05       Sure. You know, and so what are they good? They got him all pilled up. It's like, all right, good luck. What is, how many generations? If we had of people that were pilled up like this though? Oh, forever. No, I don't think so. We're social engineering mean PROZAC came into to mind when I was a, I believe when I was in high school as well,

Speaker 7:          01:56:20       first time in the first war, that was like institutionalizing people in the body. Lobotomizing people in shock. There should be like a blue iris. Right. But she was never normal after that, but it's never reached extent to, but the lawyers get, she had electroshock therapy repeatedly. Oh Wow. Didn't know that. Try to cure a porn.

Speaker 3:          01:56:36       Yeah. A lot of people don't know who blue irises. She's on the Howard stern show, like an old school porn stars and what she did and she passed away. She passed away. Yeah. Yeah. But this is a difference between the few people that are so completely out of control that you need to be institutionalized to people that don't like their job. So they give you a pill so you don't feel like shit at the end of the day every day. Because there's a lot of people that are just doing that. They're physically not healthy, their diet sucks, they don't exercise and they do a job that sucks and they wonder why they feel depressed at the end of the day. I mean, it's real simple. You don't need Prozac. You need a new fucking life. I mean, that's what you need to do. You need to eat to figure out what the fuck you really want to do and realize that you're only here for x amount of years, so the more time you spend not moving in the direction of your actual interests, the more you're going to fucking hate yourself. You're going to be depressed. It's just natural. But they don't say that. They give you some fucking pills. There's a lot of people that need those.

Speaker 7:          01:57:28       Totally shutting Robin take over Charlie's shit. That's why I joined our call. Oh, you want to do, you want to be and you can totally, that might be something like that wasn't water

Speaker 3:          01:57:41       funny checks and you're totally invited. Yeah. If you want to be in our call at anytime, definitely are called is a deal is just don't be a Douche bag. It's so simple. I don't know kind of one of bags. Will you do our little, but it's natural. Look at what you do. Look at how many people are yelling at you. Look at how many people point at you and sending you shitty emails all day. It's national to be on the defensive and start fucking with Jennifer Aniston.

Speaker 7:          01:58:06       I think it's so funny cause Cha Chelsea handler was like Angelina Jolie is a current because you're like with Jennifer Aniston. Oh really? I was like, Oh look at Chelsea handler's sticking off with Jennifer instead. I'm like Chelsea forever. Oh my God.

Speaker 3:          01:58:19       Since the early days of a, I wrote one of the, um, the reviews of her book, her first book was a my horizontal life. Yeah. She's a, I'd love party girls. To me. I think the party, it takes every kind of people. If this is on, can the people do, when are you going to get her on the podcast? We needed to get in front of way too busy. I wouldn't even ask her. She's got a sitcom going on. She's got some sort

Speaker 6:          01:58:42       of a reality show going on about her show and then she's got her show. She's way too,

Speaker 7:          01:58:47       it's already a show show, but she's got a show. I mean that's what it is. Why not? Fuck it. She's got an interesting people behind the scenes. She wants to showcases it, including our friend I really good friend Eva. She's on that show from Denver. He used to work [inaudible] assistant. I thought, Oh yeah,

Speaker 6:          01:59:06       he was the best. I love that check. I haven't talked to her forever. She was this really cool trick that worked for the Denver comedy works, just super on the ball and super friendly. She used to take us to media like one of the nicest people ever and then became friends with Chelsea and she was just such a diamond. It was just waiting for someone to come.

Speaker 7:          01:59:21       Malonga Scoop Robert. Like I told her like if she moved to La, I would give her a job as an assistant. I'm like, you're the coolest chick ever. I've never even thought about having an assistant because it seems so preposterous that you really, you can't wait. What the fuck? You got a business manager. You also need the assessment. You could, you'll get me a latte. You get Outta here. That's ridiculous it for her. I would do it. Just the two year old. Get Your Latte, watch what happens. Come back screaming and covered in burns. Two year olds, load, dishwasher. Sure. Mow the lawn. Have Fun. You know, get 'em a riding mower. Right. My brother loved that when we were a kid. My parents bought me this thing so I could mow the law. I could ride at, I can drive this thing. He was so, he was actually working well. We love done mowing the lawn. There's an aesthetic sense of pleasure and sense of accomplishment, like you've created something visually that's pretty, it's kind of an art form. I used to work for a landscaper. Did you? I fucking hated my hardest.

Speaker 6:          02:00:29       I only worked for a landscaper for a whole week and he let me go because I kept burning too many lawns. What I mean is that you fuck up, you don't know how to new use the lawnmower that well and you scalped along and I scalped a couple of lawns and he got mad at me. It was hard fucking work and what it paid pretty decent for what it was. But you worked every God Damn Day from six 30 in the morning. You showed up at work and you work till three o'clock in the afternoon and there was a gang of fucking house system Mo. You had a whole route of houses and you got to mow their lawn and chop trees down. Shit, it's backbreaking fucking war and everybody's a douchebag. You working with mostly like there was like a few guys that were kind of cool, but there was a lot of like, you know, there's a lot of resentment to anybody new that was coming along that might possibly take this shitty job away. It was real weird man.

Speaker 7:          02:01:14       Terrorism, junkyard dog type of Shit. Labors and hard man getting a job

Speaker 6:          02:01:18       as a laborer in any sort of realm construction or that's one of the most, the best ways to get motivated to get your shit together as a guy. Get a fucking job carrying bricks around all day and you know, get a job where you realize what work really is. When you realize what it really feels like to be exhausted for $5 an hour, $5 an hour, and you're carrying bricks all day. I have

Speaker 3:          02:01:40       no idea what that would be like. Ever worse. Yeah, but it makes you, I think about that shit all the time. If I ever think about like not writing or ever think about not working out or not getting the tank or anything like that, I don't think about working on a construction site and carrying bricks and cinder blocks and bags of cement. I'll think about a hard, that wasn't like what I have to do. I just gotta get up and work at something awesome. Just get up bitch. You know, it's like this is a lot harder things you could be doing if you don't have that experience though. Some fucking terrible thing. You know, like for you when you were done with all the electrocution is up the asshole like going to regular porn, it must've been like, God damn, this is a cakewalk I'll have to do is blow some money.

Speaker 4:          02:02:15       Well yeah, no actually there's a little bit of a transition that's happening in porn right now where uh, they're kind of going away from that. Like my blonde wife is getting fucked by six black guys to like more of, wait a minute, why are they stopping as well? That's been phased out now. Like man, a cheeseburger at a, at a taste. They're making parodies. They're making romance movies that are like Romance, Romance, novel, like Romcom type of, how many vampire points are there? A lot. They did true blood parody at new sensations. I mean the twilight parody they made, I dunno, they made a parody of absolutely everything.

Speaker 3:          02:02:56       Yeah. Some dude on my message board as an Avatar parody and it's a girl. She's got the Avatar of face and she's getting her mouth fucked. Yeah, and that's his, his, his avatar. Yeah. They're going to do a new avatar is going to be underwater. You heard about that? Should I lately? Have you seen the preview for this new movie where it's a bunch of chicks with guns on the poster? Sucker Punch? Yeah. Yeah. What the fuck? I haven't seen the preview it, but those posters look amazing. Watchmen. Ish. Yeah, same director. It looks complete fantasy, you know, crazy comic book type. I liked that man meets, you don't need to be a movie to be realistic. Like when people go like, why do you like like fantasy movies and monster movies with my kids. That's what I want to be entertained. I don't want you to depress me with some real story about a girl's parents get killed in a car crash.

Speaker 3:          02:03:40       Like stop. Stop pissing on my parade, Dude. Show me some monsters and some lasers and some spaceships and aliens. Did you ever see Scott Pilgrim? Did you ever end up? No, I haven't seen it yet, man. Did you see it? Yeah, I rewatched that the other day. Fucking loved it again. That is just a fun fucking movie. Really. I don't know if you would like it though. I don't know if you would like it, but I was like, they don't even like each other movie recently that you liked it. I didn't like, can you even think of one? Uh Oh ma'am. No, I didn't really love enter the void. But yeah, I wasn't in the end of the void, but that's also because I've actually done DMT and I'm like this is the representation of it as soul. So simple. And it was, there was a lot of problems with that movie, but I just thought it was cool with the visual effects. Yeah. What I thought was cool was the first person perspective. I thought that was really interesting. Yeah, I thought that was, I felt like I was really that guy, you know, if you really got into it. I mean I like seeing it through like almost like a video game with first person shooter perspective. Yeah. I thought that was kind of cool. And there's parts of it I liked, but it was just too much.

Speaker 4:          02:04:38       I didn't see anything that was like Oscar movies. I didn't, yeah.

Speaker 5:          02:04:42       No, I think king speeds. Is that about Martin Luther King or what the fuck is that about? What is it about? It's about a dog,

Speaker 3:          02:04:48       the barks and the fog named king ice. Where's the biggest fight card? It's a talking dog. Maybe Brian Roberts. The rottweiler. Yeah. I don't know what the fuck. It's fine. I don't care. I want to see, I don't want to see any movies. I'm waiting for cowboys and aliens. I don't want to see any movies that are real. This, this um, movie that I saw on the adjustment bureau. Totally. Science fiction. Crazy fucking man. Good, good. Give me more on that. Give me more fake shit. I don't want to see real shit. I know this is not interesting to me. Like here's a relationship that they had yet. Maybe if you want, throw me some crazy godfather type gangster period piece where it's not today's reality. So can I can get into that kind of, it's a long time ago. Reality, you know? But I don't, I'm not into any real movies where people get depressed in real life. Like stop.

Speaker 4:          02:05:31       I don't even watch movies that have people in them anymore. I just stick to just say animation. Yeah. Like in that Mega Mind Three d movie, Tina Fey was like really hard as the curt tune. Right. And it was just like, cool. I can like think this girl's really super high instead of like the sticky, like I'm, I'm not hot Tina Fey. Haha. I wear glasses. I'm not hot.

Speaker 3:          02:05:53       Right. First Co animated movie that I ever saw that was an adult movie was wizards. Did you ever see what it was great man. I had it on DVD, like really kind of recently. I T I can't find it. I was looking forward to my house. It's a Ralph, what is his name? Bach Bach Ski. Yeah, the guy. The guy's name. The guy that did def dealer. Right? No wait. Am I thinking of somebody else? I don't know. It was just really cool science fiction, sort of futuristic animated movie. You know, they don't, they don't do too many of those, but they're pretty dope. When they do like, do you ever see heavy metal? Oh yeah, absolutely. It's bad ass. I love with that chicken. That movie were you? Yeah.

Speaker 5:          02:06:31       No. It's even funnier or awesome. Or is the heavy metal, uh, inspired a south park where they did it did don't like pretty much heavy metal style cartoon and like the whole animation will look like that. Do you ever see that episode? Fucking it?

Speaker 3:          02:06:44       No. I need to catch up on South Park's man. I heard that they're going to do a Charlie Sheen, a parody, which I cannot fucking wait for. Of course they're going to, they couldn't not.

Speaker 4:          02:06:54       They love making fun of people. Did the best at it. Are you on that? No, I haven't been. I think they made fun of you on that. Maybe.

Speaker 3:          02:07:00       Maybe. No, I don't think American dad has. If they did, I would be honored. As long as they weren't too cruel. Please. Gentle. I'm a gentle soul and a big fan, but what they did, the Crossman Sia was the most ruthless shit I'd ever seen in my life. They beat him to death with a baseball bat and shoved frozen fish sticks in his necklace. So awesome. But they were broken down like

Speaker 4:          02:07:19       I know it can be a comedian. That'd be funny.

Speaker 3:          02:07:23       It was this the most ruthless takedown I've ever seen. The Kanye was even funny to the gay fish. Their genius man. The fucking, how about the Tom Cruise trapped in the closet? Shit. Yeah. God Damn Dude. They, they, they break everybody down, but they're the past man. There's nothing like that. So we all agree. Didn't win. Didn't they get, um, didn't, what the fuck's his name? Isaac Hayes. Didn't he? He was the one he used to be the chef or is it as a case? Yeah. Didn't he stop doing it when there was some sort of a show on Scientology? Yeah. That is so crazy. Isn't it fast?

Speaker 4:          02:07:54       It was okay when they made fun of everybody else's lifestyle and religion forever. He, he now he's dead, so fuck you. I the case

Speaker 3:          02:08:03       maybe. Maybe it wasn't even that great. Dan is here. Mom surfaces. At the end of the podcast, she shows a true colors. We're going to turn it around. Dana, we're going to put you on a positive path. I'm going to be a successful standup comedian. Ouch. I'm going to be a year from now. We're going to be looking back at this moment and then what? I did the podcast, that's when it all fucking came together. Yeah, you're supposed to be a comedian. It doesn't let you be goddamn invulnerable up there. Everything that you've done and how you've exposed publicly, you should be goddamn in vulnerable up there. You got to be a goddess. You have control and dominate. This is the d, the beginning. Today we launch. It's so hard to heal. Better way to end this fucking show. Uh, we will be back Thursday with a young and talented Andy. Dick will join us on the podcast. He's doing it from this studio. This is Rogan is not excited about Auntie Jackie House, so we might have to, but he has been sober for like four weeks. I don't know. Oh yeah, we'll do the thing about Andy. See you just never know when you're gonna run into it with whiskey on his breath,

Speaker 4:          02:09:05       you're like, fuck. He was at the Avn awards. He got tossed out. Right. Was He fucked up? I don't know. I saw him and he was just like Wednesday raw or whatever. So he was hammered. Oh, that's right. I guess I can only assume like we were doing some kind of a mirroring exercise. Andy Beck and I were doing the exact same thing.

Speaker 3:          02:09:22       He talked about it on the Greg Fitzsimmons show. He talked about it on Greg Fitzsimmons is a serious show. Yeah. And he said, you know, that he just got out of control and it was like the wheels fell off at the end, but it was a great time before that. But then it looks so bad when people are looking back on it. Yeah. One other thing, he had a really,

Speaker 4:          02:09:38       we got to pay attention to what you're, what you look like. People know who you are, you know, basically if people know who you are. Yeah. But once you, I an addict, you know, but I go like, am I, are both my shoes on or like am I, have I said anything offensive or or anything to anyone. Like how am I controlling myself? Like when you're partying? Yeah, yeah, yeah. I drink like five whiskey drinks and I was wearing a gown and like I waited until no one was around and I took my dress off and the mirage or the pumps parking structure and I threw it in the back of my car and went back to my own hotel naked. I like just put on whatever is in my car. You carry clothes around with you and just all the time. Yeah. You never know. Well we were like in Vegas, so you know, you got shit everywhere. I'd have like a baseball hat and experts just like a where I slept. I slept in a bowling alley last night in Canoga Park. What I had, but it's a long story.

Speaker 7:          02:10:35       What's Andy Dick?

Speaker 5:          02:10:37       No bye bye bye. It was so great because I had, not only did I have wore a coat because it was cold kind of cold. I had sleeping bags. I had airplane pillows from traveling so much and it was her. She slept in a bowling alley parking lot of bowling alley. What the fuck, Brian? It was great. It's just good night, huh? No, no. I actually didn't even drink last night is I think young lad. It's and love, I think. No, no, no, no, no. It's not even that. No, no. It wasn't even that.

Speaker 7:          02:11:02       So it's some girl had bowling alley. No long story. It's young love and a parking lot. That's when you, you don't mind sleeping outside

Speaker 5:          02:11:12       when you're in love. Yeah. But

Speaker 7:          02:11:14       practical when you're in love, Dana, I'll have to tell you that. I'll never experience it. I mean, they were right.

Speaker 3:          02:11:24       Those motherfuckers, it was all right. Ladies and gentlemen, this weekend, Friday night and Saturday night, we were at the comedy and Magic Club next week, Friday night at Gotham in New York City.
