Speaker 1:          00:00:01       Yes, slow down Twain, slow down. You have an orange watch. You are a fucking, what is the orange thing? I've always been attracted to orange. I grew up in Colorado, so the broncos orange is always been around me. Ah, so the favorite uninjured hurdle at the time was Michelangelo with the orange and then a really no other fighters or gyms. We're using orange, so I wanted to make sure I did my own thing. That is your own point. Yes sir. Orange. I mean it's like I absolutely love orange, but I see some orange at the store or a crowd of people. I see what warrant. Sure. I'm, I just goes boom. Right. If there's a fruit bowl, there's an orange right next to a banana. Orange grabbed the orange. Tj, what is it like being around this guy? Oh, it's intense, man. I limit, you know, life's full of energy.

Speaker 1:          00:00:40       You know, you can't be calm around him because he's got enough energy for both of us, you know? Yeah, no, he's, he's a mad man. We worked out today and he's in the middle of like training. He just gets excited. So it's hit this past year. I love it. I don't ever have to do road work because of this guy, you know? I mean we hit Mitts for so long and so hard that I'm in too good a shape already. You know? That's interesting. Like all the footwork drills and everything. I never really thought of that. Like you probably don't have to do road work. I it'd be too much. I have, I do too much training as it is. If I'd started doing roadwork, I think I'd overtrained myself. That's, that's fascinating. What you have to kind of regulate that, huh? Like there's, there's a, a standard model that like a lot of fighters fall and roadwork is a big part of that.

Speaker 1:          00:01:18       But do you think that with all the stuff that you do, if you did that as well, it might be too much. It'd be too many, too many hours put into the day. I'm just too tired by the time I get home. Or I'd have to say, I mean I could do it on the out of camp, you know, just to keep my mind right and kind of get some zen going. But during campus too much I, I train too much to be able to have to have to run as well. It's funny because everybody's got a different sort of way of doing it. Like Jeremy Stevens was on the podcast recently and one of the things that he was saying is that he really ramped up is running to the point where that, what he was saying is that having like this like long endurance base really helps him and fights because he knows that he is always going to recover.

Speaker 1:          00:01:55       You can always push further and harder. To me, he seems like it kind of fighter that does need to build on the cardio anyways. You know, I feel like each person's body is gonna react differently to training and I'm someone that has endless cardio. I feels like when I'm fighting and training. So I need to stay more, a little more fast twitch and I'm always putting size on instead of losing it. And I feel like Stevens has been trying to drop weight and get smaller and it helped with his weight cut. I'm sure. Yeah. I think it helps with his weight cut her Bra. But I think with him it's also like a mental thing too. He wants a break guys. Like he's such an aggressive guy. Like that's a big part of like it's training. It's just being able to like have those extra gallons and the gas tank.

Speaker 1:          00:02:32       Absolutely. I mean I think that's what, it's kind of hard. It's hard for me to run because of my mind. So crazy though to like, I'll go, I'll, I'm all over the place. I would rather hit mitts and be aggressive. I'm too too aggressive of a person I guess. But we were talking before the podcast about our friend campaigns just ran 200 miles and we're like, that shit is not good for you to no way. No Way. That's not good. Your body's not supposed to do that. It might be good for his brain though cause he's so fucking crazy. Like, he needs to know that he can do something like he ran for 78

Speaker 2:          00:03:00       hours. That's why I want to hunt with him. Cause I, I just know it's like my dad, my, when I grew up hunting, we'll go hike a hundred miles in a week to go, go out the back country and have a backpack and sleep out in the middle of the woods. I just feel like that's how cameron hanes would do it, you know, just as hard as possible just to just to do it. Yeah. My friend Adam Green tree from Australia came over, flew over to America last week, went to Montana and then hiked some crazy amount of miles into the mountains, uh, camped out when in deeper and deeper cause he kept encountering wolves and Grizzly bears camped out there, shot an elk. And for the last four days has been packing out this elk by himself. Wow. Four days. So if you've never shot an elk or you ever seen an elk before, folks and elk could weigh, you know, somewhere around 800 pounds, which is probably around 400 pounds of meat that he's packing out.

Speaker 2:          00:03:55       So four days of a hundred pounds on his back. When we are in your hiking, you can't carry it all. You got a quarter it out. So not only say you hike five miles with some of your back, you had to go back and get the rest of the Elta height that five miles again. So you're hiking the same trail, a trail, you know, two, three, four times depending on how big Dell, cause you know when you're quartered out. Yeah. And he's pretty sure he said he hiked 12 hours. So that could easily be, you know, who knows how many miles at high altitude, I'd imagine a puzzle. So he's got a hundred pounds on his back for 10 hours. 12 hours a day for four days in a row. Yeah. That's an engine. That's a workout. I feel like there's, I feel like there's nothing better than that. It's so primal hunt with a bow out in the middle of nowhere.

Speaker 2:          00:04:37       Especially, I mean by herself. That's crazy. Well y'all, he'll also, you could get them on instagram. Adam Green tree bow hunter on instagram. He documented at all, you know what the instagram stories. So he was there. There is a, and a dude met him up there, a friend of his, a hiked through the night to come and meet him up there and help him I think on the third or fourth day. But uh, he's got all these videos of him up there in the mountains. That's an awesome picture. Yeah. It's just, it's just so cool because I mean, he's just out there survive. Look at this. We're looking right now for folks at home listening. We're looking at this tent that's covered in snow, the grounds covered in snow and uh, this is where he's been living for the past week. And that is the high country because when you're a public land, most countries don't or most, yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:05:24       Most countries don't have the same sort of public land set up that we have in the United States. We can just go hike into the mountains and camp out and these national forests. And so, uh, he, uh, took advantage of all that and he's up there. Oh, where's it savage Australia. Oh, okay. Okay. That's right. Yeah. All you have to do is come to Montana. You buy a tag. I think attack for an elk is 1000 bucks. And you know, he's up there with a, a pistol because there's bears up there. So his, his, uh, his kill site, a bear came in on his kill site when he came back. There was a grizzly there and there's a lot of grizzlies in Montana. Um, uh, Mendez

Speaker 1:          00:05:58       was just up in Alaska and got an awesome Mousse and a, his story's pretty cool too. What? He got a real big moose. And then over the night and camp, a grizzly bear came in and tried to take his moose off and took a big chunk out of its neck. Yeah. So it is his whole story of what he's got going up there. It's pretty cool. Yeah. Went on an awesome hunt and she'll hold wow. Look at that thing. Yeah. So we're looking at Chad Mendez is it says a 63 inch do it yourself. Alaska Moose Hunt is now live on his youtube channel, 63 inches, the width of the horns, which is just insane. That's insane. That is an enormous animal. So if an elk is 800 pounds, that's probably like 1500, 1600 pounds. That's an enormous animal.

Speaker 2:          00:06:40       And he goes through guided hunts, right? Yeah. He just guides. Yeah. He guides people. That's his passion. Yeah. That's what he wants to transition to after he's done fighting. That's where his passions at and he's extremely good at it. So no reason not to. That's cool. Well, here's a question. He got popped for some supplement thing. Like one of the in a lot of people were getting popped for tainted supplements. If you buy things in the store, there's a lot of supplements that you get like at any, any nutrition store that have all these, uh, like if they're not steroids, they're peptides. There are all these things that sort of make your body produce more hormones that are real legal by Usada. And, uh, he got caught for that stuff apparently. Is that what he got caught for? That they proved it. That it was a supplement.

Speaker 2:          00:07:22       Oh really? Yeah. Oh cool. I haven't really asked them too much about it. It's a bummer. That's good. At this level you have to be made. It would be mindful of what you're taking into the body. So especially with the new guidelines. So it's just part of following the rules. Can't go in the Cajun. I poked some way, but go. I didn't know. Now there's so much going on with the supplements now you have to make sure you put it in the research and investigation. Speaking in your body. I poke in. Did you see that picture of Travis Brown's finger knuckle deep into febreeze over dooms eyeball? He didn't even say anything in the fight right there for doom. I don't remember seeing Verdomme Call Hall. I don't remember. I did see that jump, that jump psychic in the beginning of the hand on his trainer like crazy.

Speaker 2:          00:08:01       It was a cool, without that fight there was cool. It was a cool fight. Well, it was, it was a bomber to me to see Travis fight like that, because I remember travis earlier in his career was just to look at that picture. That is fucking insane. Esther, Esther Lynn from all elbows on Instagram, put this picture up and, um, she's an mma, a photographer. She takes awesome pictures, a picture. And this is insane. I mean, it is literally knuckled deep in his eyeball. It just, it's hard to look at, man. It's just, Oh, my knuckle though too. Right? There's middle knuckle. His finger has disappeared in the eyeball. I don't remember him stopping or saying I poke or anything. I don't remember either. Let's focus. But there was a bad one earlier in the night with Jimmy Rivera and a Uriah. Yeah. That was a bad one. And Jimmy Rivera after the fights that he couldn't see, he still couldn't see.

Speaker 2:          00:08:51       He's like, he said, he couldn't tell what color things were out of his right eye. Yeah. Fucking I blokes, man. Pride gloves, Huh? On the gloves. A little bit of a car to turn there. And that opened all the way. Sorry. No, I think you're right. Yeah. Most of the time, this is what I do. I obsessed about marshmallows to making things better. Someone's got to do something because the way things are going, we're just so many guys are getting, I go so many guys getting damaged eyeballs. It's just, it's not worth it man. And it seems like we're waiting for something terrible to happen. You know? Like look at Michael Bisping, I dunno. Bisping's came from a kick though. I feel like it might've come from vittores kick. What was it that or was it in practice? I don't know. Do you think it was in practice?

Speaker 2:          00:09:32       I think he detached his retina a couple times, so I think that's why it is the way it is. I think he's heard it multiple times and it was kind of where it, because it's not completely fixed. I think they fixed it enough to where he can fight and then when he's done fighting they'll probably fix is I completed these, what it seems like what they did is they stuck oil in his eye. I don't understand it, but one of his eyeballs apparently has oil in it that's protecting the retina. So that's why one of his eyeballs is black, like, you know. Yeah. I was wondering what was going on with designs. That's why. Yeah. One is black and one is his original ICO, which I'm not sure what it is, but it's very strange looking, but it's just, he's a fucking savage. I mean, he didn't even consider retiring.

Speaker 2:          00:10:09       He's like, Hey, yeah, stick some oil in there. Let's get going. We didn't reckon do put an eyepatch on. Let's do this. Got To get back to the gym mate. He does push it. That guy comes to fight. He said Animal Michael Bisping is the middleweight champion of the world. And who saw that coming? He did. He did. Yep. I seen that opening and uh, and uh, luke rockhold to instagram videos leading up to the fight. I seen the same thing his trainer saw. Really? Yeah. He was leading it back. He was telling me weeks before the fight that thinks he was doing, while he's hitting Mitts, dropping his right hand all the time with his left cross and kind of leaning back and kind of shoulder roll and, and whatnot. And Duane called it out a couple of weeks before the fight that he saw openings. You know, he didn't say he was gonna get knocked out with it, but he saw some openings there, you know, is there, I mean that's, it's pretty simple. We can see where the openings are on that one for sure. And uh, I remember after bisbing caught him and his trainer point Adam, and I'm not quite sure what he said and left him, but he was for sure saying like, see, I told you, I told you I like that one. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:11:04       Yes. Yeah. He's a good boxing coach. He understands the game. I got respect for that guy. Um, but it's cool to see something you've trained multiple times come out and actually work. And then when the fight and then the title fight. Ooh, that's, that's nice. That's rewarding. And along the lines of like what we were talking about today when we were working out is there's so much depth to this sport. There's so many options and there's so many possibilities that to the outside or people look at it, it looks brutal. You see that I poke and you're like, oh my God, this sports should be illegal as much. Correct. But to a person who really understands and watches it and appreciates it, it's like there's so, it's like this crazy language that you have to learn with all these different words and all these different ways of putting together sentences.

Speaker 2:          00:11:47       And I like to use the language analogy because I'll give, you're talking to someone and they only know a few words and want to yell at you, but you're like some Sam Harris type dude who can just has an incredible language and you're just so eloquent. He spin them up like a web and they don't really don't know what the fuck to say. And that also happens in a fight when a guy has a very simple, like real obvious game. He does a couple of things and he does it well as long as you engage him in that same sort of simple, obvious way. He's got a chance. But when you over flood, I'm like, Dwayne, this Duane was showing me this switch series that he works on, which is really amazing. Really, really interesting stuff. Thank you sir. But one of the things I noticed is while you were demonstrated to me, because it's so unusual if forced my brain to hiccup for a second ago. Oh, okay. And if that happens in a fight, you're Foxville oh right. Oh yeah. 100% those little hiccups. Right. Those little moments where your brain is overloaded because it's got to think instead of just react because you're doing something unique

Speaker 3:          00:12:48       thinking inside the octagon, you're going to get caught, you're going to be in trouble. It's, you need to have a completely clear mind and just kind of react to things. And for me, it's just been kind of having fun out there. You know, the more fun I have and the more loose I stay, the better I'm going to fight. If I go in there with a game plan and thinking of what I want to throw in, what to watch, watch out for what he's good at, what he's not good at, then I'm going to be a little bit slower. You know,

Speaker 2:          00:13:09       we were talking about your fight with dominick Cruz that you seem so emotional like you want it to kill that dude like you were. So I mean I definitely want to kill him. You know it was so hot. I mean it was obvious you were, you were head hunting as opposed to like one of the things that I really enjoyed about what your first and your second fight with Hanan Barao but your first fight with Hanan Barao was like, here you are fighting for the title. And he was like, you're on a sparring session. You were just so loose. Like right away you can throw every, there's nothing and attention to what you were doing. Everything was like flowing and I was like, look how well he's responding to the pressure. You were having a great time out.

Speaker 3:          00:13:46       Yeah, exactly. Not, not thinking about it, you know. And like you said with the Cruz thing, I want, I wanted to finish him. I want him to go out there and put a point on it. And uh, you know, things you learned from those are, those are the small mistakes you learn from it and you change them up next time and you, uh, come out there a little more level headed and uh, you know, play his game. That kind of like you were saying, you know, he, he's a point fighter, you know, and if you go out there and let him point fight you, then that's what he's going to do, you know? Um, so you've got to be able to react to how he fights it and change it up a little bit. And that's why each training camps a little bit different. And you learn those

Speaker 2:          00:14:14       things, you know, when you go and watch a fight after it's over, do you see openings and you're like, shit, yeah, that's called regret.

Speaker 3:          00:14:25       Sorry. Yeah, 100%. You'll, you'll see it in the, uh, you'll all get, I'll start sweating because I'm getting mad that I didn't do something correctly. You know, like in the end of the first round, I was watching the fight against Cruz and I had a double leg locked up so deep and I just didn't finish it. And that could have changed an entire, the entire fight, just one take down the beat. In the first shot I was all the way deep, hands under his butt perfectly. I just stand, pinch my elbows to finish it. So I went to lift him and he slid right through my arms. One difference I had to make was pinching my elbows and you know, it

Speaker 2:          00:14:52       changes it just one of those things in the moment. Isn't it fascinating how like you have to train perfectly and then you have to just let everything go automatic. Yeah, that's exactly it. You just, you hit the nail on the head is to train everything perfectly. Now it comes down to quality reps, but then what's a quality rep hitting in that? Getting here or getting them to take down, not getting taken down, things like that. Right. So now it comes to the, the point of adapting to the athlete in the scenario and what's correct. Again is making sure they have high success with that technique, whatever that technique may be. So just putting in, putting in the time that reps till it comes out fluidly and there's no longer a thought, but the instant reaction. Well and also having the right coaches to give you that information and can give you that high level technique because there's so many people out there that are talented people, but you see their game just doesn't evolve.

Speaker 2:          00:15:44       It just hits this level and it's sort of like the level that their coaches are capable of taking them to and then they don't go any further. And in that code you have to believe in trust and that coach will take you to that level of someone. I mean, someone can be telling you the exact thing you need to do, but if you don't trust and believe that guy, if he doesn't get it through your head the right ways, then it's not going to make sense. You know, you're not gonna, you're not gonna do it cause you don't believe in it. Well, I think it's amazing what's going on right now with MMA that people who are casual people like, um, perfect example, the other day I was at my daughter's school and one of the dads came up to me and this dude was just a new fan.

Speaker 2:          00:16:21       He'd only been watching mma for the past year and he was just rapid firing questions at me and he was obsessed with it. He's like, I was never into martial arts when I was a kid. I watched a little bit of boxing and he's like, but man that UFC has just got me hooked. And he's like, one of the things that I love about it is how many different ways of fight can end. He's like, it's just, it's so crazy. Like you'll, you'll watch a fight and then all of a sudden the guy's getting choked. Just like what happened? And we were going over this, uh, about it. And this guy was a real smart guy. I think he's like a hedge fund manager or something like that. But he was obsessed with all the possibilities, you know? And I think casual fans are starting to understand now that this is a very intellectual pursuit.

Speaker 2:          00:17:02       If you don't have a strong mind and if you don't have this full range of options and possibilities inside the octagon, you're most likely limiting yourself. Agreed. Agreed. I see that. Yeah. Possibilities are nice when you change things up. And again, like we said earlier, confused the brain, get them thinking about something else and then you do something else. So that's always nice. But I think right now we're seeing like, um, there's a, there's a pack, right? There's like the standard pack of, of athletes that are doing things in a certain way and then there's a few that are moving away from the pack and they're expanding the potential of MMA. I think you're one of those people. No, I appreciate that. And I think you for sure are one of those coaches and there's a few guys out there I know you don't like to hear, but dominick Cruz is one of them. He's also doing it. And we were talking about him today that like his style

Speaker 1:          00:17:50       is so fucking odd. You know, like it's technically not sound actually, but you know, but he uses it the right ways. He's got awesome timing. Yeah. He's got great cardio, he's got a great Chin and then you can get away with the bad things he does. Cause he does them for the right way for himself. You know, I don't necessarily think you can say it's technically bad because he's so fucking successful. Yeah. And he knows how to do it. I just think it's not standard. You know, like he doesn't like we're using Ramon dekkers as an example. He does not throw kicks and punches like Ramon dekkers. But what he does do is he throws him like Dominick Cruz where he's moving like a pendulum back and forth and it's, footwork is so weird and he's overwhelming your mind with possibilities. And he doesn't do the same thing twice.

Speaker 1:          00:18:33       He mixes things up so well that he's a tough nut to crack. Did he? He, he's tricky. He is trickier than I expected for sure. But the, you know, a piece of that, again, game planning is the talks up to the fight to get them emotionally invested and then it becomes a bit trickier to find the head. Right. So that's the goal. When you were, when you were leading up to the fight, he was talking so much yet and you could tell that you were getting so upset, but that is a big factor in fights, right? Because fights are so emotional because it's one of the only sports in the world where your health is on the line. Like literally like this the option, it's not like you might get in a car accident when you're racing cars that that's a possibility. But the goal of MMA is for you to fuck up someone's body.

Speaker 1:          00:19:15       Yeah, absolutely man. Um, the other thing you had with him too that makes it pisses you off so much is that he'll attack anything and just talk about some of the, doesn't even make sense just to talk and talk louder and faster and not, I'll give you a chance to talk. It's like a high school girls just bickering at each other. I think that's what pisses you off the most, you know, cause he's not even actually making a great point. He's just making it and making it louder. Voice. Very articulate. Yeah. It a good good analyst because of that, you know, greed. So my technique, if you get a chance to find him again for the title, I bet which you're in line. Yeah, right. Obviously, well you lost a very close decision to him and then you beat hot felon, Sun's out. Which in my opinion was a, we were talking about this today was an excellent example of how far you progressed because you guys had a really tough fight the first time you fought.

Speaker 1:          00:20:00       It was a close fight. This fight was not closed. He just ran away from him and he ran away with the, uh, the fight rather, not run away from him, but rent. I mean, you were just, it was a clear victory. It was like you're just were so much more technical. There was so many more options you were presenting to him and he was basically the same fighter that he was back then. Maybe slightly better. But you're all way better fun. I appreciate him and we, we've worked hard. We've long hours where it's really hard. Um, you know, it's crazy how the, like you said, the sport works out how quick things can change. You know what I mean? I could be on 11 fight win streak right now and a split decision loss to have fail since sal. You know, I thought I won that fight. A very close fight with dominick Cruz that I felt I want as well. Those two fights go my way. I'm on 11 fight win streak. You still have the belt, you know, known as hopefully one of the greatest comp pound fighters in the world. You know, and we have stuff for sure.

Speaker 2:          00:20:48       What's interesting right now too is this new rule, a set that's going to go into place in January, you know, a where they've changed this whole thing about down fighters like being able to attach it down. Yeah, good call. You have to have four points down now. So if you, yeah, if you put a hand down on the ground and someone kicks you, that's, that's totally legit now. Which I think it's long time coming. I think that's a, I'm a little bummed out that didn't give her of the 12 six elbow but you know, whatever, which is one of the most ridiculous rules cause that's really not going to hurt you anymore than me putting a shin across your face, you know, like crazy or getting neat in the face and crushing your skull. Yeah. That stuff happens all the time and now you're going to take away an elbow and you can't even really generate that much force with, I don't feel it's not more forest.

Speaker 2:          00:21:32       Yeah. I mean I think there's way more forced than the elbow that comes down the side. Cause it's more like a punch because you'll get your whole shoulder torques into it. Your shoulder dropping down is a weird movement. I mean, I guess there's some guys like Anderson Silva or you know, yachts and Cli or some badass tie fighters that can generate ridiculous power with that. But I don't think it's any more than any other kind of elbow. Absolutely not. No Way. It's just some of the rules I think are a little bit archaic I think. I think we all agree though. The the, the, the gloves. Yes sir. Probably like if there's going to be like one thing that needs to be changed, I mean it would be really nice. We could all get together and figure out a way to make it so there's less high pokes and here's three experts in the field right now.

Speaker 2:          00:22:11       We're all saying no pride style gloves would be an example or like the shadow gloves, but anything that it doesn't allow the hand to fully open. Fuck they own pride. Just use those goddamn gloves. Those are the sweetest gloves too. I love the pride gloves. I collect all kinds of fight memorabilia. Yeah. I'm all over the place now. They're dope man, by the way. Show everybody your, your wallet. Oh yeah. I'm a boxing coach. Whitman who is by far the most technical martial arts I've ever come across. He took a, an old fight glove and a worth. The cameras are there. Made me a wallet out of my glove. Yeah, I saw it on. So dope theft is nice. He uh, he makes all my, uh, my punch punishments but type has met my belly, showed my leg kick paths, might kick shield. I'm super impressed.

Speaker 2:          00:22:54       I was always impressed with trevor as a cost. Some get a picture so I'm going to put that he's just, he's just an engine. I mean I'll take that same skill set and put that into martial arts or to developing technique or drills. That's the same things that you did that same information to running a successful business or whatever it is you just said. Detailed guy. Yeah. It's uh, it's, it's just fun to see someone do something that's unique, Huh? So colors, you guys are in Colorado now. You moved to Colorado full time, you know, how much different is it live in there and what is it like now? Also your, your training at altitude all the time. That actually made a huge difference that even taken to account when I first went out there when I was cross training and I was going back and forth from my camps going from Sacramento to Colorado and always going back out there, it was so tough and, and somebody will get affected by that to do differently. You know some like Joseph Benevidez doesn't get affected by it at all. I feel like that Mexicans,

Speaker 3:          00:23:46       he never gets tired. Mannequins don't get tired. I don't know some racist things to say but in a positive way. Tell you I'm the Mexicans have a fucking incredible gas tanks and Joseph will come up, he'll be gone in Vegas, we'll come out and he'll train exactly the same for me, when I go to altitude, it messes with me big time, but I feel like I get the effects from it long, long term. When I'm done with the camp, like I felt big differences when I trained at w train at altitude, when I'm done with my camp, after I've been up there for six weeks, I'm in a camp and you come back down to sea level. When we first started hitting mitts that wherever we go, it just feels awesome. You know, sea level, you feel like a superman, right? Yeah. It's crazy how much of a difference it makes.

Speaker 3:          00:24:23       Have you ever tried one of those altitude tents, those things that people sleeping? I have tried it. It's so hard to sleep in it, isn't it? Yeah. It gets hot in there and then it, and then your body doesn't recover as well. You know, if you're sleeping, that's really high altitude. He mean anything higher than we're at. If just even a real high altitude, it's hard for your body to actually recover overnight when you're actually supposed to recover. You're supposed to, you know, have your testosterone built up when you're sleeping and oxygen getting to your muscles and recover over the night. And if you're sleeping at high altitude, it's really hard to do that. You wake up more sore, you wake up more tired and it's hard to recover. Interesting. So what I had heard was that the best balance was training at sea level, but sleeping and living at altitude.

Speaker 3:          00:25:01       I heard that as well. It seems like it wants to go back and forth all the time. That's what I heard when I was in school. You know I was a kinesiology major and I was really into exercise physiology. They said train low, sleep high, you know, so that your body, when you're sleeping and hanging out, you're rebuilding all these red blood cells, but then your threshold or working out at sea level, you can push it so much harder. So your body's used to go in that hard, you know, but you, you're training in lack oxygen, you can't train as hard. So I mean that makes sense to me. But then when sleeping in and out to do 10 I feel like you can't recover until you're acclimated. Once you're acclimated, you can recover because you have more red blood cells in your body. But until then, I wonder if anybody does it where like you live in San Bernardino and then train up in big bear and just keep going back and forth

Speaker 4:          00:25:42       and then sleep Tito's thing for awhile. He lived up there though, right? First Tito, you still live up there for his camps. He was one of the first MMA fighters to incorporate that, you know, boss Oh, Boston, Boston puffers, heavyweight title. Uh, he came to Colorado for his camp for its fight against Kevin Randleman. So I sit there Rutan so, cause uh, there was a promoter in town that would hold shows. They were called the lone wolf invitational and uh, he had a couple shows and then I think it would be his third show. Boss was there. He was just the special guest. So then the shows after that, we're now at the boss Rutten invitationals but when he was there, he would, he would be a special guests of the show and then he would do a seminar the next day. Then I'd fight on the show and then do with seminars. That's how we, uh, came together and, uh, he noticed the effects of the altitude and then sweet, just his next camp there.

Speaker 3:          00:26:29       I wonder if there's a difference between like when, when I think when they're studying how athletes perform while they sleep at a high altitude and train at low altitude. I wonder if there's a difference between the intensity level that MMA

Speaker 1:          00:26:44       requires and the amount of like, I don't think there's a sport in the world that requires you to train as much as mma because there's so many different things you have to work on or as hard. Like we just share with a lot of nfl players with Lauren then Dow, uh, and, and Denver, he trains a lot of denver players and a lot of guys come for before they do their combine and come and train with them. And you just kind of realize like how much harder your shrink conditioning is and how much harder you have to push. And that's just one workout, you know? And then maybe they're going to do some football drills and whatnot and we're going to hit meds and do some grappling and wrestling. And it's, it's a very tough sport to get ready for. I mean, I really don't know if there's many that are as hard or harder.

Speaker 1:          00:27:21       That's what makes it fun, Huh? It's fun to watch. You know? It's really kind of crazy when you think about like the 10 minute rounds a pride had and how difficult five minute rounds are. Well, he definitely needed, if you're a grappler, I mean, who the fuck is going to beat Damien Maia if ever rounds, 10 minutes. Good point. Yeah, you're going to be worn out. That guy's a backpack is such, he's so on another level right now. That's one of those guys. It's so good at one thing, but he's, but he's, but he's incredible at it that he can get away with it. Most guys can't get away with just being good at one individual aspect of them and may, but he's one of those guys that he's just so dominant at Jujitsu that you can get away with it. That's the, the theory too, or the concept is he's really good.

Speaker 1:          00:28:00       They were in, they could choke while a few submissions obviously. Right, but let's say you're, you're just Ninja at the in. They could choke. Now that's your one technique. Now everyone's aware of that. So I got to do was just have different entries for that rear naked choke. Right. So different entries and then obviously you finished the submission. But as far as the striking concept, the same techniques or combination, just different entries in different exits. Right. Again, that same technique itself. Yeah. There was a few guys who have just really excelled at one particular technique to the point where it gets ridiculous. Like remember cody Mckenzie was catching everybody with that. Mckenzie [inaudible] callback. Yeah. Ski Team. He came and showed it at Alpha male thing. It's crazy, but you got to be built for it though. He's like perfectly built for his arms are long, skinny.

Speaker 1:          00:28:40       Well, uh, then there was Paul Sas. Remember Paul says like the triangle 12 fights in a row by triangle and everybody knew it was coming. He couldn't do shit about it, but you can get it. Yeah. You can use that to your advantage though as well. So I was helping Matt Brown train from Maya and uh, I didn't like how he was approaching the fight that he was so worried about what he was going to do. He's like, he's going to do these take downs, he's going to take her back. He's going to do this. Like he was so entrenched in what Damien Maia was going to do to him in the fight rather than worrying about what he should do, what aspects He should take to the fight to stay away from his game instead of really what he's going to do. So, you know, you can use that to your advantage if you're a fighter that's so strong at one thing, confused someone and get them so worried about what you're going to do, that they're actually thinking inside the fight rather than reacting and just doing what they're good at already. Cause if Matt, if Matt would have fought, I feel like the way he should have in that fight, he could've picked Damien Maia apart maybe. Yeah, yeah. Oh No, he would've got fucking grapple fucked again maybe later on. But yeah, that's my hope and thought at least. Yeah. Well I'm a big map brown fan, but I'm a be Zoe and Maya fan as well. For me it's, it's weird,

Speaker 2:          00:29:41       you know, because I'm a fan of a lot of guys and these guys oftentimes fight each other and it's just like you just got to appreciate the event and appreciate the results. Sure. Appreciate the sport. It was one of the cool things about mma is that there are these outliers like this one trick pony, like Damien Maia. But what a fucking trick. I mean he's, I mean he can strike and Damien striking has gotten leaps and bounds better. It's one of the reasons why he's gotten so better at applying his Jujitsu is because he's so much more comfortable with his standup is distance is very good. Now we understand striking really well now, but that Jujitsu, it's just so next level making it happen. So he runs through a guy like Carlos condit like that. Yeah. Or out graph was Gunnar Nelson grabbed his gunner Nelson that easy and you know all them.

Speaker 2:          00:30:24       Yeah, just Malden, like you said, at another level. For sure. And also goes to show you how fucking good jake shields is. Oh, you're right. People sleep on jake shields. Jake shields beat him in a, essentially a grappling match, you know, and a lot of people forget, you know, Jake shields was always a guy who kind of struggled with a standup because he wasn't like a explosive guy who's just sort of like comp awkward. His standup. Yeah. Awkward. But again, he beat Tyron Woodley the fucking welter weight champion. The world lead them in essentially a standup file. So of Nate Marquardt. Yeah, she'll just smile with his grappling. He, he's coming out the muscle farm, worked out with us and showed some technique and his top game is just so ridiculous and he's strength. It's just all about is positioning the weighs on you. It's, it's so tough.

Speaker 2:          00:31:06       I mean it's, it's a chest mass freshman chess match for sure. Yeah. He gets slept on, he's fighting Fitch now. They're going to fight in the world series of fighting. That's a very good fight. Very, very interesting fight. That's interesting. We have bought both ways. I was wondering about Fitch. That's good to see him back in there. Here's a fuck per wall. Right? I don't know when the last time he tested positive after he fought pal horace. Oh, did he? Yeah, I thought it was knee got hurt a little bit of that too, but he tested positive for elevated testosterone. Oh Wow. Yeah, I have that. You got to follow the rules and the guidelines. Rules to happen. Yeah. But back to like styles. It just, is it just so interesting that there are so many different styles and there's so many different people like wonder boy, he's a one trick pony and the other direction, you know, just his fucking striking.

Speaker 2:          00:31:50       It's just bizarre. And his style is like really a karate based, almost like a sport karate style. But it's incorporates the movement in the operating for a longer distance and he likes to draw people in to get them extended before he catches himself. So he's like a Cobra. Exactly. Is Movement like his back and forth pivoting off the waist. But he also, he does another thing that fucks with people is that front leg. Yeah. His front leg is so nasty. I keep when he fought Hendrix, he hit when a front lake side to the body and you could see Hendrix got leg stuck by, it was a hard shot and you're like kind of acknowledged it and then he got roundhouse kicked in the face with the same foot like right away. Zohan in her face all the time. It just never stops. Funny to me, a dream fight is Damien Maia versus wonderboy. The complete opposite style. That's a dream fight. I want to see what the right, it's like, I feel like now what we're watching two with Damien Maia is also, we're watching this master who's 38 Oh, you're right. Good point. Yeah. He's still, well he's, he's up there for the competitive ages, but he seems as healthy and it can happen. We said 38 me forever.

Speaker 2:          00:33:02       It's one of those things where you got to wonder like how much more sand is left and that hourglass means it pulled the radica tour trick just fine until he's 50 yeah. I mean fuck randy almost came out of retirement for fade or oh nine he was thinking about fighting. What am I saying? That just as an old fight fan? Yeah, for sure. You got to think about that. My other two being 38 and be able to push it that hard still is it his style of fighting, you know, he's not getting hit very much. He's on your back. You know, his training's probably that way as well, and so he's able to go a little bit longer rather than someone that's going to be in front of you and slug it out. Yeah. Good point. He's definitely taking less damage striking wise over the years when Judas stat on him, when we got hit 13 times over the last four fights.

Speaker 2:          00:33:40       No. Well, yes. And like the like it just, that's in most of them are the Matt Brown fight. Yeah. Oh Wow. It's just fucking crazy how like technical he is when it comes to his Jujitsu. Yeah. Yeah. That's why you don't play Jujitsu. Right. So we've got to punch him in the face while he kicks like nate Marquardt did. Yeah. Well nate caught him early in his career too though. Still striking up game. Yeah. Yeah. People sleep on nate Marquardt too, man. You know, people forget how God damn good nate, especially in his prime. And you watched that tyron Woodley fight when you fought him in strikeforce. He looked really good. Then you have a nation that he hit him with was like fucking a video game. Yeah. Yup. He was sharp. That's when he was working with the Trevor Whitman. He's back with trevor as well. But his name again, trevor is by far the most technical detailed, uh, martial artist instructor that I've come across in, in any field.

Speaker 2:          00:34:29       He really makes it breaks things down. And I hear Shane Carwyn is making a comeback as well. Yeah, he's a free agent. Yup. So he can go wherever he wants. Interesting. Wonder where that's going to go. Good. Nice thing. Is he training with trevor as well? I'm not sure. I don't actually spend too much time with trevor, but uh, hopefully if he's smart he should. He will. I know he's really close with the wrestling coach me at least, or bullying. And I've been hearing it from the Easter that you know, he's a free agent and looking about getting back into working out and seeing how his body holds up to see if you know how he's going to push it and what's gonna happen. Yeah. He has some pretty significant back injuries. Right? Yup. It was his neck. Right. I think is, you know, you gotta think that guy played football at a high level for a long time and all that crashing big dudes smashing into each other. Those guys are freaking nature's man. I can't, that's so crazy to be able to be that big and that fast 230 pounds is run into somebody who's standing there. It's not good for you. Yeah. I definitely not good for you. You want to stay healthy, that's for sure. Yeah. Cause it goes back to uh, keep keeping those same rules in line when you're training that the goal of the training is to get better, right. Not to hurt each other. So just making

Speaker 1:          00:35:38       sure you're taking care of your partner. And learn to use this time to improve and get better and better. I get the better you get and so on. Yeah. And if you can get a good camp like that where everybody has their ego in check and you all grow together, that's mass. Yeah, no egos there to learn and get better. Overall, it's something that I've had to obviously work on too because I'm so competitive and I want to be the best all the time. You know? Even in the gym, no matter what, I'm like I'm pushing like I want to train harder than you. I want to be better than you. And so that's something that we need doing. If I had to work with and I've always had to work on it, you know, I just kinda got to, you know, stay, stay, control the fire.

Speaker 1:          00:36:09       How do you control yourself when it comes to like the amount of work you do? Do you monitor your heart rate? Do you check? Like do you have any sort of markers that you checked to make sure that you're not overtrained? I know a lot of guys do it off their heart rate. It's a good way to do it. Am I just kind of off the field for the most? So how am I waking up in the morning and how am I feeling? Am I eager to go train? Am I eager? Just still feeling like I'm the best in the world? That's kind of like my body lets me know mentally of what I should be doing, what I should. And it's taken a while to learn that I wish I would've known this during wrestling cause I, I, I believe I messed up my wrestling career in college by just pushing too hard for too long and red lining my body.

Speaker 1:          00:36:42       So it's all just all feel now and I kind of lay out my, my whole camp that way, you know, I know what days I'm going to do three practices, what day I'm going to do one and just kind of go off a feel, you know, if I need to rest the whole weekend or just rest Sunday, it's all if just my energy levels and how much I'm willing to do. Do you, do you have a nutritionist or, I do. I'm perfecting athletes. I'm actually teaming up with them now tune. We're doing programs for little kids and for wrestlers as well. Cause the wrestling, the wrestling world does not know enough. I mean they've cut weight for the longest amount of time, but they just do it the wrong ways. But yeah, perfecting athletes has helped me out a lot with my career and they actually have been able to boost my hormones with the way I eat.

Speaker 1:          00:37:18       You know? And that's how so, um, so my, my a nutritionist Michelle, she used to be a fertility doctor and she's real holistic. She's into acupuncture and doing all that. And the, the, the, the foods that they're feeding you are the right things for your endocrine system and boosting your testosterone and making you just a healthier human being. I mean, if you eat and live healthier, your body is going to produce more testosterone and live the right way. And that's what they'd done with me. And what I've heard is that more fats like eating more fats, good fats. And I've seen it in a lot of different athletes, especially athletes it fall, start falling ketogenic diets that ramps up their hormone production because fats are a precursor for hormones, so a lot of coconut oil, a lot of Avocados, saturated fats from healthy meats, especially like grass fed meat.

Speaker 1:          00:38:03       I feel like you can't get enough of it. I mean, if you're working out as much as I am during camp or even just working all the time, like you can't get more, the good fats are one of the best things for you. Yeah. That's the other thing to take into consideration when people talk about athletes and people talk about people that exercise and are fit and want to follow a healthy diet. There's such a different caloric requirement. For someone like you who's training, what do you train two or three times a day? Yeah, two or three and just to switch it up, sometimes I'll do one j one harder line. Just depends where I'm at. But yeah, I'd say on average three times a day, so your body is just a blast furnace. It's hard for me to hold on to weight. You know, it's, I had a try, I got to try as hard as they can to keep my weight up.

Speaker 1:          00:38:41       So when I'm out of season, like right now I'm trying to lift his lift heavy and stay as big as I can. And then when I get into camp, you know, change it up while I'm doing that. A lot of hypertrophy right now, let of hypertrophy training, I'll get closer to campus or doing more strength training. And then when I get in camp like closer to my fight and do more power training. So when you say hypertrophy, like what kind of training? Like what? Like like dead lifts? Like what kind of stuff? Yeah, I mean I'll obviously I'll do delis and stuff, but it just, it all depends on the reps you're doing really and how much weight you're going to do. So if I wanted my approach, if you have find a weight that's hard for me to do 10 to 12 times, you know, that's what's gonna make my muscles build them like higher reps and start building size.

Speaker 1:          00:39:18       And then when I want to get strength, I'm going to start doing less reps, you know, around like six and that's hard to do at six and then that's when we started building more strength. You know, power is uh, you know, three quick hard explosive, you know, dead lifts and cleans and stuff like that. Breaks in between sets. Yeah, all depends on the brakes as well too. Yeah. So when you're getting down to one 45 or one 35 rather, how difficult is that for you? Like what are you walking around at a during camp and walk around like one 50 I usually show up five days before my fight at one 52 I usually train what I'm going to fight at. So I walk into the cage one 51 53 probably I'm training like that my whole entire camp five days before the fight and Wayne one 15 and then I just lose it all with waterway.

Speaker 1:          00:40:00       So that's not that much. Not at all. And it seems like a lot to poke people listening probably, but we know guys who are losing 25 30 which I think is too much. I think that's not healthy for your brain. That's too hard to recover hydration on your brain. You know? Have you ever thought that if you didn't do the hypertrophy training and you didn't do all the power training and you just did more robotic, like you might drop down to one 45 naturally and then might be able to cut to one 25 yeah. Yeah. I mean I thought I could make 25 I mean it's definitely wouldn't be fun and I don't really, I don't really want to have to, but yeah, it's definitely something that I could do. I mean, you know, I'm trying, Heidi mouse needs a supervisor. He does man. And I'm a huge fan of the guy too.

Speaker 1:          00:40:39       You know, he's so good that I would love to fight him and I, I do feel I have a really good style for mighty mouse too. So, cause I know he's talking about doing a superfight. He's, I mean it's, he's in a interesting position because he's really essentially cleared out his weight class. I mean, he's fighting Wilson Hayes and Wilson's a very tough fight. Fight the winner of the show that the benefits of just, it's a bit of me just, just a wrapped up filming a show with the, I think, uh, do meet you supposed to fight the winner of the show. I think you're right. But what did I read too? That way he was supposed to fight, but he got hurt and pulled out of the fight and now I think he's supposed to fight the winter. The ultimate fighting, sir. No, I think you're right. But I read something today. I forgot about that, but I read something today about him fighting Wilson. So maybe it was just a, an older article or something like that, or maybe it was confused, but my point is, even if you fight is the winner of the show. It good luck to those guys. Yeah, good

Speaker 2:          00:41:34       luck. You're fighting a fucking human buzzsaw yeah, yeah. He's on another level again, cardio punching from all angles. Yeah. He's good man. And he's, in my opinion, one of the best examples or the best example ever of a guy who has so many possibilities. His language, the language of fighting his language has the richest vocabulary of any fighter. I mean the way he fucked so hutto up in a clinch with those knees to the body like that is it. Who does it better than that? I've never seen a guy did good break a guy down better with needs to the body like that. You'd have to go to Anderson versus rich Franklin. Oh Nice. Good call. But that was like almost like a more brutality oriented thing. I mean when Anderson did it was just grab a hold of you and just rag doll you with with when he was doing it, when mighty mouse is doing, it was almost like, like it was crazy to watch. It's like Jesus Christ, like these things are coming there. They're landing like that. The vibe, he's firing them off like with no hesitation. There's no wind up, there's no exertion. Everything seems effortless and they're there. It looks like he could do it all day and it looks like a real fucking problem when you're in there with them.

Speaker 4:          00:42:38       Well, what are the, I think I'm assuming make sense is Matt Hume, his being his coach who's obviously the wizard, right? Very intelligent in the fight world, but with the background of pseudo missing weight, so much attacking the body, assuming that maybe he had a hard cut and maybe ate too much to drink too much and attacking the body as far as the game plan. So it was very smart of him. Then also, obviously he did it with the correct timing and accuracy. So yeah, it was good. So who to really struggles to get done in 25 that's what I hear you look big on the show. I filmed a little, yeah, I just did 25 huh? Yeah, I, I find that, yeah, he may be,

Speaker 2:          00:43:14       I mean maybe like the exact example we're talking about with Tj like that maybe they were like very similar in size.

Speaker 4:          00:43:19       Just decided to go down there and AH, good call. Yeah. It just doesn't have the correct, maybe not the correct path to actually make it happen. If he's actually missing weight, they needed to get, I don't know what his deal is. Lesson a long time. He did a few struggles in the past but to, he missed a couple of the UFC weights, Huh? Yup. Yeah. And they made him fight at one 35 that's spotify at one 35 and then the showed them that he could make 25 again and did it and then because he's going to be fighting that, but it'd beat us now and I'm not sure when that fight is, maybe December, but the at me, this is coming out to Colorado in about one week. He just texted me the other day and he actually bought a condo in Colorado. Susan be training with us full time until the fight and that's nice. But maybe this is a very creative martial artists. We and him, when we train, we flow, we create a whole bunch of new rhythms and paths and patterns. It's good. I do. I love it as a martial artist finding the next level of the game. It happens a lot with him. Also at Tj, it's fun to work with that level of athlete just to play with the game itself. Overall, expanding the level of martial arts. That's where I'm, I'm fascinated by what's the next level? Where are we at? What can we create?

Speaker 2:          00:44:20       Yeah. Benevidez is also one of those guys that if you saw him like in a silhouette, if you couldn't see who he was, if you couldn't see any detail but you saw him move around, you would know it was him. Yeah. That's good. The way he holds his hand, the way he holds his hands, like

Speaker 4:          00:44:32       everything cause you've got a very distinct, oh, he's one of my favorite people in the world, man. I love that dude. He's such a character man. We're really just spinning kicks and stuff. He's got him, dude. What do you got here for notes, dude? What's going on? It's made just for me to slow down and make sure I take my time and uh, yeah, that's my main thing. Let's slow down and think I get so wrapped up and just getting it. I put myself into fight mode when I talk and I just got to make sure I'm being calm and being collective and making sure I'm getting the points and the messages across with with what I'm doing. Because now obviously on the podcast, this podcast has helped change my life over the years. And I'm sure you get this all the time, but you'd literally help change people's lives for the better.

Speaker 4:          00:45:10       And I thank you for that and thanks for having me on. And for us it's, it's, it's bad ass, but uh, to use this type of properly to help influence others and not to try to tear anybody's name down, but to help uplift and inspiring and help people become better human beings. That's what I felt my messages on this earth is to help people become better in my vehicle. My tool is martial arts, so I love it. Whether general fitness or training, the highest level Ninjas to compete for the belt. It's my service back to the world to help make sure we're all together. Well, it's interesting to see you really flourish as a coach too, because very few fighters who I'm here taken to it the way you have, where you're not only will you a very good fighter and an excellent fighter, but you've, you've surpassed that as a coach.

Speaker 4:          00:45:52       That's really rare. I feel that. I agree with that. I appreciate that. Um, I just put my time, energy and my, and my ocd ness in to developing others. Like that's literally what it is. I'm obsessed with it and there's only one way to be great. It's to be obsessive, you know, and then to have, you know, a fellow ninjas like Tj and Benevidez to play along with, with this tool of martial arts to see what the next layer is. I love it. You mean I need this level of dedication and athleticism in order to do that? So, uh, because of them, I'm at the level that I'm at. So it's a win win. Like every relationship should be, read the notes slow down, like every relationship should be, it should be a willing, not, oh, not a one side of the path. So, um, you know, not long ago Tj asks me why I'm always so hyper and excited and loving life.

Speaker 4:          00:46:36       It's because his goals are my goals. Like one of my dreams is to see him with the belt again. Like that's something that I obsess. I was to make sure he's wearing the belt there. It's in its proper place. So, and same thing for benevides. I would absolutely love to have been a vsp wearing the belt. So, um, for me to help others become better brings me a lot of joy in it. And I loved that. Isn't it funny that that passion and that intensity and focus has a negative connotation? People call it OCD. We're weird with obsessed. Yeah. Yeah. It works for me. But it wouldn't mean, but why, why is that like necessarily negative? It's not, yeah. For, well, I, for me, because I have so many things going on, there's so many other elements throughout the world with my wife, my family, and my business.

Speaker 4:          00:47:14       I'm lucky and I'm blessed that everything in my circle, my bubble works with each other. Well, because I mean I take my kids to go and train, my wife goes and trains people asking me this quite a bit. Are you going to have your, your kids fight? No, I'm not going to have the fight if they choose to, I will support their path, whatever that is. Whatever their passion is that it was a support that where they do have to train because it look at it as a form of insurance. I'm not always going to be around to protect them and want to make sure that they can handle potential confrontations if they, if they can, if they need to by either talking about it, you know, turn to diffuse a situation or if it does come to come to a physical confrontation, they can handle themselves properly.

Speaker 4:          00:47:50       But just being healthy and happy and confident with your walking your talk and be able to help other people. That's what I make it. Sure. It's mandatory that my kids do train martial arts and my wife as well, El Guapo just texted a sensei car. Man Carter is definitely going to find out bossy. Yeah, little boss. So my, uh, so I have my daughter Jade, my little boy Duane Ludwig and then my third child is Carter boss led but we all refer to him as possible. I'm a little boss, he's the man. So since uh, since everyone's my main, uh, my most influential martial artist to make an impact on me and uh, he's changed my life with what he's done for me is carrying his passion in my martial arts journey and then he's the first guy to take combinations and put them into one coat.

Speaker 4:          00:48:36       Great boss. Ruben is here. Bas rutten, ladies, gentlemen, former UFC heavyweight champion and of the baddest man that ever lived. Thank you for coming. Have a seat time. No seizures. I know Carter is going to fight just cause how aggressive he is. I remember like the first time ever go into Dwayne's house and watching his little two year old, two year old pride stomp his dog. He knows what a pride stop, isn't it? Price doubling the dog. We have big, big huge pit bulls. One of them was so a move but two year old kid stomping a pit bull. That's what people have a misconception. Pimples being bad dogs, but they are known in the past as nanny dogs. My kids can actually physically rough up my pit bulls and they don't care. They're big enough. They're strong if they're composed of and they're females.

Speaker 4:          00:49:23       So they just, they're just about it. The female that does definitely helps for sure. Yeah. Don't tell them this story, uh, that uh, you pretty much went naked then I heard from your wife yesterday separating the pedals. So, uh, uh, the two dogs did you have two females? Two females. That's all good. Yeah. So the story would prove your point. Crack. Uh, I'm about to hop in the shower and my wife tells me the dogs are fighting out back. So I grabbed my towel, I wrapped around it. I run outside to separate the dogs cause they'll fight cause there's the neighbor's dog barks and they'll bark at that and the bark at each other. Then they start arguing and fighting. Right. So I anyways, they went outside with my towel on to get the dog separate them. While I'm separate in the dogs, the towel falls off. But I still have to separate the dogs and the neighbors behind me. Now it's a show boom. And they have, they have to get together back naked. Just rolling with the dog and separating them and making sure everything is good. Uh, I'm not sure. I'm not sure what his wife looks at me now and it's a little bit strange. [inaudible] she does it. She doesn't know. Uh, it's always nice to

Speaker 5:          00:50:28       feel wanted. That's a sad scene. Separating each are fighting pitfalls. It's funny now he's flopping around this shit. Oh yeah. That would have been good. Although it's a joke now is I'll stay at the dogs fighting to go rip my shirt off. Now's a good one. I had two females. It fought to the death. Oh, that's right. Yeah. I heard that mom was a dead dog in my living room. Not Good. Yeah. How was the other dog was healthy or it had some fucked up. She was fucked up. I put her down after that. She killed another dog too. She was crazy. And then a rescue dog. I got her a little too late to my rescue. I got her when she was about nine, 10 months old and two you'd already been indoctrinated into the world of violence. Oh, I see it as much as I travel and move around.

Speaker 5:          00:51:08       I want the pit bulls there cause no one's in there breaking in my house and they pit bulls and my wife happened to the gun and everything so we're good. Or if they do it, they're not going to have a good morning guys. Yeah. Yes sir. Yeah, there's and females are like super protective. She, they both the more yep. Yeah, yeah. They genuinely love our kids. Yeah. But females together like date just there like chicks together. Like try, try having two wives. Good luck with that shit. But to get it to the restroom. Right. That's what they do. Go together and stab each other. Just, just something about females. They just, two men can, they get together and one of them will decide or two male dogs, one of them will decide like, okay, that guy is the king and I'll just fucking cower when he growls at me. But females dade fucking, they never decide who the outfits, they just go, Nah, that bitch got lucky last time. We're going right now.

Speaker 6:          00:51:57       It's women. It's all the time with women. If you think about it, well my wife goes to bank for it. She went out with the other women. They all this always stressed like, oh, so and so has cancer so and so is this with us, with guys that never comes up right here about him? He got no, we are like Barney. Yeah.

Speaker 5:          00:52:15       So much sorrow. That is so true. Women always want to tell you who's sick, who's got a problem. Oh, she's got chronic fatigue syndrome.

Speaker 6:          00:52:24       Oh, they read on the Internet. Oh, I have a headache. And they read it and you're like, oh, this could be cancer,

Speaker 5:          00:52:29       right? Oh yeah, all the time. My wife says it's good. My wife, she's on point with stuff. She's good about that. Good positive stuff and last down and take care of the family and she, she's good. She's programmed herself wisely. I feel well they say that there's natural sort of evolutionary path that women get together and talk a lot. Like that's one of the reasons why gossip exists so much with women because women would be gathering food and talking and that was one of the ways they figured out who was full of shit and who wasn't. They had where's the men would be out hunting and he'd be like, shut the fuck up. Oh, interesting. Interesting. Yeah. That's why men value. We'll also why men, they value quiet men who know when to be quiet. It's important. And also they, they don't value men who wear shiny shit and are really loud and have a lot of junk on and stuff like that because those assholes would get in trouble.

Speaker 5:          00:53:20       They would fuck up hunting parties. Interesting. I I agree with that. That's right. But it makes, I read it. Yeah. Women are programmed to do more things simultaneously at the same time. That's why they can really take care of the kids. But he can do anything. We don't, we just have one focus and that's it. That's why I went to military and women. I always think it's a dangerous thing. And the reason I'm saying in dangerous thing is because the natural inclination for a guy is to protect a woman. You know? So if something happens, everybody wants to automatically, that's an instinct that's built into the guy to protect a woman, which could of course make a big trouble in the integrate. Right. And I said [inaudible] to treating them as an equal on the battlefield. That's it. Yeah. Protect them. Well maybe trading wool or take that away.

Speaker 5:          00:54:03       You know, if they train like a guy, then they go, okay, my wife is down. So see, I don't want to break it down. Show fight. She fought me. Can't play too rough with the kids. I go see her looking at me watching over across the gym. I'm like, Oh shit, she'll come on, fuck me up. And she's, she's, she's awesome. But why was the keeper? Well, it's strange times because we're, we're asking women to take on a lot of the traits and characteristics of men, you know, it's, uh, and uh, some of them want to, and I understand that, but some, for some they feel like they're required to, and I don't necessarily know if that's what they want, you know, I just, but I think society wants a woman to be a breadwinner. They want women to contribute and compete with men in the workplace.

Speaker 5:          00:54:51       And a lot of ways in a lot of women want to do that tail. Lydia? Yeah. And then you like, when you see that and then when it comes to the military, it's very difficult to say like, oh, women shouldn't be on the battlefield because then all of a sudden you say, well, what are you sexist? You know, but, but it's not traditionally a female open option. Yeah. If you, if that's a path you want to go ahead and go ahead. I want to be made. You'd be, you will have fun. Yeah, I get that. I mean, there's some women that I think would probably gravitate towards killing people. They'd probably think it would be a lot of fun. Well, if you're a feminist then also when you see a spider, don't let us get rid of the spider. They all want to play power.

Speaker 5:          00:55:23       Power that there's some of them, you know? No, no, I do everything myself. I said, well that's your job right now as well. Yeah, I guess so. Why was the reason, something about Arachnophobia where they were thinking that Arachnophobia which is a fear of spiders and a bunch of different like snake phobias and much different phobias might literally be the memory of your ancestors. Like someone you know in like someone your ancestors know, died in front of them, got bit by a spider or they almost died and they got bit by a spider and that shit is just hardwired into your DNA that says some people see a fucking spider and they can't move. They freak out. It doesn't make any sense. My daughter freaks out when a wasp comes by. She'll just freeze. I'm like, Holy Shit, I got to go pick her up or swap the for the wasp away. We have lost in our area so that Kinda makes, she just freezes out, fly around. You don't know where they're going or what. My daughter's got good foot work. Did you ever hear him say that? She does. That makes a lot of noise. Like meditating, flying in front of Michael. When you meditate

Speaker 6:          00:56:24       they come and fuck with you. I look, I opened my ass. This guy came back twice. What's up and he's right in front of me. Here he goes. Maybe sends to your ci for sure. Three Mil. Is that Sensei? Sorry, is meditating in the yard?

Speaker 4:          00:56:46       We're just talking about [inaudible] before you arrived. As far as um, I went to go back to this, but again, he's the first one that I was aware of that actually did elevation training when they came to Colorado. So I already said that. But also with what he did is he took combinations and then chunk them together. Hence numbers like four. If you say four in the root and system is Jab, cross, Hook, cross. So again, it's that same idea of taking the combination and checking it together. Because if I would say jab, cross, Hook, cross, that's a lot more time than me just sing for. And that concept is what it took to continue the, to develop the system and just the idea would be able to communicate with tj on the paths are in the cage with limited time, just calling simple commands or combinations so we can actually make sure that the fight, so taking place, not getting too sidetracked, he knows he's got a really interesting system is a Mark Henry Mark Henry Trains Edson Barboza and Frankie Edgar. He is a fantastic trainer. Like one of the most underrated guys in the business. He, Rashad Evans told me that he will name combinations after his daughter like Rashad. I saw that like certain things and they changes them with every camp, with every camp that change, the names change. So no one's ever gonna be able to pattern you then never the other corners not going to have any fucking idea what he's calling out

Speaker 6:          00:57:56       Tyson. He used to change the numbers all the time because they would have a number system, but then every time he would change the number. So nobody could pick up too much shit. If you change, you're going to chase you up or always having,

Speaker 1:          00:58:10       oh he's be so lost. Yeah, always adding. He's got a system. We do an online system. We do his own academy, which he teaches, you know the basic stuff. I mean boss, we've got a boss Combo. We do, you know, we got my combo, stuff like that. We'll put it online and, but then we always switch it up. So each camp, my combo might be different, you know, but if he completely switched all of it up, I'd be law. We already do too much as it is. I'd be lost. Yeah, we did the boss come today. What I'm trying to like when you're trying to remember all these different things and put them all like the Ramon dekkers, there's like 50 shot.

Speaker 6:          00:58:44       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:58:46       the decors like stuff like that. The Tyson and the deckers. Those things kind of tie together that you're doing things you're supposed to do naturally anyways. Like you know, you're returning with the same punch in slipping and then rolling into the body and kicking inside than kicking the head. Those are supposed to come together no matter what. He's just making it a combo. So once you stop, stop thinking about the common way, you just naturally start to do it and putting in reps with the Tyson, he's fallen the hooks up with coming to the body and then the upper cut. So it's kind of stuff that ties together and it's a lot easier to remember. It has to flow, has to flow natural intuition boss before you got here, we were talking about the level of mma right now. So fascinating because there's so much depth and people are getting so much better and there's so many different styles and it just seems like such an exciting time right now for MMA.

Speaker 7:          00:59:28       It is. It is really exciting for me. The first big change that happened in mma was that everybody knows in shape. Finally, you remember we had to all these guys running out of gas. I got it, dude. That's like being a painter and half a can of paint to a job or run out of paint. I'm sorry. It's the dumbest thing. Go run a hill. One guy one time told me, I said, yeah, but a heavyweight there shut gave Valasquez and he goes, yeah, but he trains really hard

Speaker 1:          00:59:52       also. He's Mexican. I looked at him like, are you kidding? You're just giving the answer. Just train really hard. And there's a science behind it now to you know how to train when the train that hard and which ways to do it. How do you know how to make your body bigger if you need to or faster if you need more endurance that train that way. So I mean it's just like all these other sports there is coming up real sport. You know what to back up my Mexican theory, uh, I talked to crazy Bob Cook and crazy Bob Cook's said came, we'll take like a month off or two months off, get hurt. You know, something like that has to rest up and injury, not trained, come back and now work everybody. Not Fair man. That is not how we were talking about Gilbert Melendez. Another one. Fantastic cardio. A lot of Mexicans have crazy fucking cardio man. I always had good cardio. Just might just be a little hard to, he has a good cardio cause he doesn't calm down. If he shows up here early for the podcast, he's out in the parking lot. Shadow boxing, you know what I mean? He's not, he's going to stay sharp. Scare the neighbors. That belt back that got us in his phone hanging out like little wayne for whatever he's got to do to happen. He's always doing something. Always crazy.

Speaker 7:          01:00:58       But it goes to up. But the thing with Duane is when you hold focus, which a typist for Dwayne, you cannot say, oh you cannot take a break for five seconds and say listen, it makes sure that you do it. He goes, hey, he wants to keep, keep going, keep going. Hard to hold time. I said guys, step back dude, this different now. Okay, just relax constantly is in my face. You know he wants to go 100% all the time.

Speaker 1:          01:01:20       Hi. He does that to me. Holding me like I'll be hitting mitts will be going for like an hour, hour and a half. I'm just like, you know, dead tired. So my faints and my fork have gotten so good cause how much he's in my face. He'll come at me at nonstop wanting me to throw combos and I am so dead tired, I'll faint and move. You know what I mean? Like give me some time, let me read, let me read, you know, good cause of uh, developing your skillset and martial arts as a whole. So it's a purpose to it. We're talking about how interesting it's been, how Dwayne has transitioned so well and to becoming a trainer, you know? Was that a challenge for you going from being a great fighter to being a great trainer?

Speaker 7:          01:01:58       No, no, it wasn't for me. It's always been like I'm riding shotgun, you know, each show or for Fritz what it meant to be. If we're talking about if a, if a student fights, I'm more nervous than the student at that Modena would be when I would fight for myself because then I'm in control. So no,

Speaker 1:          01:02:15       but sometimes it's difficult if you don't have the right student. Right. If you, your student's not responding

Speaker 6:          01:02:20       and they call. Yeah, it's very hard. It's a watch, you have dose, you know it's, but a lot of them don't. A lot of these fighters don't listen to their corners still til this day top fighters. I mean you hit a corner constantly screaming. They don't do what they're doing. They think they can see it better, you know. But once there was a trust, you know, and and, and there was always a good trust between Dwayne and myself and the same with him and Tj then he knows what you're seeing. That's probably going to work, you know, and that, and he will do it. Like if I would say four to Dwayne in a fight, it will come out less than a second later. I really just shout for Papa, Papa Echo mouth right away if you, if you could enhance my voice when he's fighting.

Speaker 6:          01:02:59       It's a video game. He does. We need to get a bull horn listening, get a bull horn. The UFC shallot bullhorn. I did that and UFC, I brought a mega phone because nobody was screaming and they actually put it into contract after that that you could watch my fight against go suck here. Short combinations because I figured in Japan they're quiet right here. Everybody's going to scream. I'm not going to hear them. So uh, avi, Avi Rubin's the old owner of the Beverly Hills Jujitsu Club says, I'm going to bring a megaphone. They go, yeah, that's a good idea. That is a great, what about just like a tube, like a roll of toilet paper or something like that? Up a piece of paper. Yeah. Could that work? I'll try it. One of those guards, cones I always go to when I seen him, the reason why I brought that up about a training fighters is because there's a, there's an interesting parallel between you two guys, both great fighters and then both wind up having great students.

Speaker 6:          01:03:52       You having Dwayne as a student and Dwayne now having t j's is getting in a bunch of, yeah, I mean there's, there's a lot to that. There is, you know, but, but it's all connection and that's what everything in life, you know, once there is a connection that is, if people, you know, if, if I don't care for him, you know, as he's not a good guy, you know, and that's what some fighters also, they come in to just work out, they're gone again, you know, they don't build a relationship. And once that happens it will, it hurts. They're fighting, I guarantee you that. Yeah, I'm sure. And for fighters it's really a problem when you build a relationship with the wrong trainer and then you've got to leave that guy and you know, you have this tight bond with someone who doesn't really know enough.

Speaker 6:          01:04:29       That's a hard one. That's, I've seen that many times. And when they leave, people get super butthurt. It gets, it gets to be a real problem. But for, for the, if it's real, it's real. And it's always say, you know what I said to my daughters, he said, what do I tell the guy said, just tell the truth. You know, can't go wrong with it. Truth. It's the guys. Sorry. You know, it says like on inside of him and me, I would say about a certified all he that kicks that sucked or this sucked. And they say, yeah, but what if you're going to get him on the show? I should, I'll say the same thing. And if he tells me that I'm wrong, he can't say because it did suck. You know, you've got to just got to be honest. There's nothing he can do. Yeah. It doesn't mean they suck as a human being. Not just means that in that moment that was the wrong thing to do or they didn't execute it properly or, you know. Yeah. And then I have to be on point too, as far as the trainer with the, with the fighters and coaching, if I gotta make sure I'm calling the right commands at right time as well. And that

Speaker 4:          01:05:18       goes back to the relationship that you have and making sure you have that connection

Speaker 6:          01:05:21       when you also have to know your fighters capability. Exactly. When you have a great race horse, you know, it'd be, everything becomes so much more interesting because you have all these options

Speaker 3:          01:05:31       [inaudible] you're going to have so much mental behind it too. Like Twain knows how to coach me to, you know, like not everyone responds to negative energy. Not some people will respond to negative energy, right. Like Danny Castillo, you got to tell Danny could steal, like you're doing that like an idiot come on. Different things that you know, and he's like, okay, yeah, he'll do a better with me and Dwayne. Someone where you know, you know, I've got to pump the guy up maybe a little bit, tell him what he's doing right instead of what he's doing wrong. You know, so you gotta know how to coach each fighter and once you build that relationship, like bosses talking about and you don't let it go. Yes sir. There's very few things that are as painful as listening to bad corner work.

Speaker 6:          01:06:04       Yeah. Oh, that's fun. Oh, you gotta hear it went down to his live around the corner, cross blue cross. I go, he just went. You don't want him to throw a right hand right now, you know, let him keep that here so the liver is protected and I go, yeah, that's an idiot. Exactly. Who does that? Right. Did you watch the fights this weekend? Yeah, I did. What did you think about steep an hour, man, that was crazy. Crazy, crazy. De Three or four large punches you gave Darwin there on an inch there. All exact at the same spot. It's got really good position. Yeah, just stopped him and he got hit heart. He waved it off, but that's the Tina. We know. 11 guillotines. I believe that he had to be dry and tight once he pulled me in a one time I said, I want to feel it.

Speaker 6:          01:06:47       I go, Whoa, this is a really tight guilty, but he got out. He's in the, he's a freak athlete. He really is and he's a very likable guy. He's awesome. He has deep is a good guy. When we were talking about his composure. Yes sir. Yes. So composed like in Brazil when he fought for Breeshia, when he's wanting to stare down, he's just dead faced. He's got his own dead face. It's not like a fade or dead face or cane dead face. He's got his own dead phase. But those guys that can just stay completely calm, you know, in that incredible environment of being there in Brazil, 45,000 plus people screaming for Fabrizie over doom when he just shuts his lights out

Speaker 4:          01:07:23       with our own or main battle. Right. It's being able to, to control ourselves and he's looks to have mastered that ability to control his own emotions and make sure he's directing the energy and the right path. So Steve Bay, good job. Grasshopper,

Speaker 6:          01:07:35       that motherfucker to see if someone got into his head the way like you and dominic were going after each other or the way connor got into all those head. Right. I guess that was a masterclass in fucking with someone's head. Absolutely. Connor took Aldo completely out of his element or he was just so frazzled by the time they actually met each other inside the octagon. It was just, I think we had the overeem and a steep, it is just same as home and, and a Raji, you know? Rousey's intimidating. Everybody, Eh, the way she is. And she, when she started at the stare down, that's when she lost it because she realized holly didn't care at all. Right? She was just there. I'm going to hurt you. That was at as the same as everybody's intimidated by

Speaker 7:          01:08:16       overeem. And you should be because he's a monster. But I think open could see in his face already, he's, he's not intimidated. This guy has absolutely no, and then when you fight a guy like that, that that little voice starts playing in your, in your mind when it gets bad, you know? And that's why maybe we saw these crazy things of running away, you know, which I, I say it's a good thing because I said the same thing against conor Mcgregor, but you know, for a big, huge heavyweight, it doesn't look good. You know, and now you, you set yourself up more as a victim because he's following you in tech. And that all is an input in your, in your own brain. Because now you start telling yourself, oh, I know everybody thinks I'm a, I'm hurt or that I'm afraid of. Am I afraid?

Speaker 7:          01:08:53       I'm even know there's the whole doubt thing that goes on in the mind. There's always these two voices. I say the one voice wants to quit that the other voice wants to go. Right. You know, you're a really bad situation. And they say, okay, call it quits. Gullah cuisine. And then some of the other ones, I don't know. No, no, no. Wait, wait, wait. We're not going to, no, no. Let's just, let's just see what happens. You know, and then suddenly you come out of the situation. I was, I was about to tap in my second fight and, and, and, but then the audience started cheering for him and then my ego took over. I go, okay. I get out of the situation and then 30 seconds later and knocked him out to the need to deliver, and I go, okay, this is the last time I'm going to think like that because the bat boy stay away from the bad voice.

Speaker 7:          01:09:29       Yeah. Focus on what you can control and that yourself. Right. Do you ever use any psychological training? Did you ever talk to a sports psychologist or anything like that or is they're all self taught? All self taught, but what I did a lot is talking to myself and people might laugh about that, but I'm very honest to myself. Like people say, oh you nervous to fight? No, no, no. Why not? What can happen? What can really happen? He's got to knock me out. Matt's going to be hard because it never happened before, but if it happens while I'm not going to feel it, apparently you know you're going to go down. Submission is the submission. Is that really so bad? I'm going to tab so what is so really so bad? Well, the really bad thing is listening to all the crap that older, the not so good fats are going to tell you afterwards is social media, but if you just scare you, remember the last time I told the story from in the room, if you take a fighter and and who's normally a nerve is final.

Speaker 7:          01:10:16       This is what I tell my students who are nervous when they have to compete. I say, okay, imagine now the guys right here. We put you in the room, we locked the door. Nobody can go in there. You guys fight. And when you come out, you're not allowed to say who want to lose. Did you? Do you really care if you, if you would lose it? He goes, no, because everybody can lose. I said, well, that's the mindset you should have when you go into a fight. That's my mindset. You know, winning or losing, I'm gonna win. I'm gonna do everything in my power to it. But if I lose, so what? You know, we're human and we come out of it. I say, you make you overcomplicate things, certain combinations. When I said it's a four and then I, I do four punches to the head and then I say I'm going to, we stayed with this combination.

Speaker 7:          01:10:53       The only thing we're going to change either heights, so now I'm going to say for you to the four points, it's a left, right straight, left hook, right straight. I'm going to share. Okay. Body had had had, no, you're the first one has to go to the body. Had had, had body, body, had hat head, body, head, body had buddy. I mean now you can make like 12 combinations from just a four punch, you know? And but some people when, when I tell it to my students sometimes they overthink it. They go to, oh no, I said no, just in body hat do the same combination. But they start thinking, oh that's the liver shot that no, that's not liver shot to the body. Just, you know, keep it simple. And once you can keep it simple, it's much easier to, to do.

Speaker 2:          01:11:29       Well, it's one of the things that we were talking about earlier. It was the, the amount of fighting that is mental and the amount that is your attitude and how you feel about things and how you go into things and just your enthusiasm. Like Travis Brown, we were talking about Travis Browne, who earlier in his career was this fucking stone cold killer. I mean he had all his crazy footwork. He throw a lot of kicks and memory. We knocked out Stephan's true that Superman Punch, right? Yeah. God Damn. He was so unpredictable and wild. I was like, this motherfucker's can be the heavyweight champ. I just give him out, give him some time. And then he moved to Jackson's is training and a great camp, but he just doesn't seem, I mean maybe as a few losses in a row, he doesn't seem to have that fire in him.

Speaker 7:          01:12:11       Did he lose when he was at objections? He chased Kemp's, yes. Started losing after you change camps most of the time. But that's what I tell people, like my stretch routine and every time when I say this they, they, they ask me what it's just routine. I do the same stretch of team as I did 23 years ago when I started. Same routine. And the reason is it never got me an injury. So if it's a winning combination, don't break it. And it's the same with your team. If it's a winning combination, do not break it. Once you bring, how many fighters do you see changing camp or firing as a trainer of firing the manager or somebody who always helped him and suddenly they started losing you. You broke the spell or whatever you want to call it, the mystical thing that was going on that was working. Don't break it. Why would you,

Speaker 2:          01:12:53       yeah, but it's so rare that you find the perfect person. Like if you're with Johnny mcfuck stick in Columbus, Ohio, and he's a shitty coach and you've been with them forever and you've got this weird bond with them. And then for Rasa, hobby wants to train you. You're like, God damn.

Speaker 7:          01:13:07       Yeah, but what do you do? And everybody runs into bus route and right off the bat, sorry, all my students, I say, listen, I teach straight down two times a week. Go anywhere you want any gym. I don't mind guys. You want a spar without a guide to go anywhere you want. But the problem is if you have that guy we were talking about it doesn't know anything, he's going to be butthurt. He's going to be okay. You cannot no go. You cannot go. But a good coach will say, go just straight everywhere. If he can find something better.

Speaker 2:          01:13:33       Perfect examples. Duke Roufus, who's a great coach and Pedis Pedis started training at Jackson. He just wanted new looks. You want a different things, you want to mix things up, and he had some great times.

Speaker 7:          01:13:42       That's, he also cares about Anthony Pettis. He cares about his career. He wants him to grow, and so he's like, yes, please go do this new stuff. Every time I went up and trim, if Rasa Tristar, he loved it. He loved the idea, go up there, get some new looks good. Yeah, it's a new technique grow, you know? Those are real friends. It was a real people that care about you and they want you to have the best thing in your life. I said, Dwight [inaudible] cabs, she got show. Yup. Yup.

Speaker 2:          01:14:06       Well there's a small handful, maybe a half a dozen or more of really truly

Speaker 4:          01:14:12       elite camps right now. You know, there's American top team of course is is a few that you could go over, but of places where you're really kind of can't go wrong, it's really just a matter of finding the right combination for you too. Right? I mean, some, some camps are more grappling heavy and you might be back a more of a striker. We've seen that happen to, you know, the guys just kind of get the wrong formula. It's the thing, if you're a great striker, go to a more grappling oriented camp. That's what I always say. You got to striking. That's what I decided. Okay, this is it. Forget about striking three times a day submissions. That was it never lost again. It's just doing what you're not comfortable at and do that a lot and make sure you get comfortable at it. Then that's it.

Speaker 4:          01:14:50       Wonderboy is great example of that. You started training with Weidman who was a great wrestler and it just completely changed his confidence and his stand up and now he's so loose standing up, you're getting to see the same wonderboy. That was, I think it was like 57 and [inaudible] was a kickboxer. Amazing, crazy like that. And you see those skills now because good luck taking that guy down. Correct. You know, he's, he's getting mauled by Chris Weidman all time. Weidman, who is a big one, 85 yeah. You know, there's so many levels to mixed martial arts, so many areas. And we could obviously take the, the three easy ones with the striking, the wrestling and the grappling, right? So with those now, what's your style? What's your skill set? And now with that being said, you've got to make sure you're getting with the best people in those three areas or something that we could take in the fourth account, which since I said earlier, is the conditioning aspect now.

Speaker 4:          01:15:38       So there's a lot of pieces of the puzzle and you can't just go to one guy, he can't just go to a boxing coach with the boxing coach isn't really familiar with mma because things are different as you point out today with the distances, right? And then using the switches because of the further distance. So you've got to make sure you have the correct people that understand the mixed martial arts game. Because if you go to an expert, cried the guy who doesn't understand where me, that's not going to work no matter how much you guys love each other. It's not gonna work. You have to have mma in the mix. Wrestling coach doesn't know how to strike. Yep. He's not going to learn how to close the distances with punches, the build time, time your takedowns, he's going to want to grab a hold of you and move you around to shoot on you.

Speaker 4:          01:16:11       You know? So yeah, we might also not understand where you're in vulnerable positions for submissions. Like a lot of wrestlers are still shoot that double with the neck on the outside, you know? And I mean they just haven't figured the distance out or the difference in the, in the technique out. Yup. Agreed. Yeah. That's why I love this, this tree on this lineage because I'm taking what since it has done as much as I can. Then what I've done and then adding that up and I'll pass it and Tj is way, and this is a direct line of lineage of martial arts information that's been expedited and it's, it's, it's awesome to have an actual march start family and just keep passing on the knowledge. It's fun for me as a martial art nerd, it's also interesting because Tj has that wrestling background as well. And then I think that's a big factor in his success because he's incorporating all of your techniques and your techniques and then on top of that you've got that elite athleticism and then the wrestling base. So you've got awesome take down defense and take downs. And also I really firmly believe there's something about wrestlers that fucking grind of dieting and starving yourself and yourself and

Speaker 3:          01:17:10       the mental toughness that breed that you know, you get from certain wrestlers. It's like it's off the charts. I've still to this day, never done anything harder than wrestling. Even with all the aspects of martial arts and fighting like fighting to me is it's just a lot, lot easier than a grind of a wrestling season. You know, I rest of the cal state fullerton where we started way too. Or Lik I said, I overworked myself and push through a ninth month season. Being completely strict on everything. My Diet, my, you know, I can't go, I'm not going out and having fun with my friends because I'm wrestling and then wrestling every weekend and just such a hard practice. Like, still today we do two days a week like restaurant practices. Like, damn, I don't want to get ready, love wrestling. I'm gonna have to go really hard. Like man wrestling, I've done it.

Speaker 3:          01:17:52       You know, it's tough man. And it definitely does breed mental toughness. And then you're learning how to compete on your own every weekend. When you're training a team elevation, you doing wrestling practice, are you doing strictly wrestling? Are you putting wrestling shoes on and you're doing like full on wrestling? You like a competition between your, your teammates. Are you doing that of we do that as well as we'll do it even may wrestling as well. You know, there's different forms of it. But yeah, I'll go through my wrestling shoes on and we're doing matches, you know, it depends on where we're at. We'll do situations and yeah, we're doing full on real wrestling practices. Is there a benefit to having wrestling shoes on though? Because you're not going to fight with them on your defense will become way better if you wear shoes. So it's so much easier to get out of a take down without it.

Speaker 3:          01:18:31       You can't like a single leg, you should not get taken down in a single like anyone may. If you do your, I mean it's so easy to slide your leg out on a single leg, but with a wrestling shoe on, I can't, I can't just go to that easy defense. I have to use my hips, have to cover his head, I have to use all these positions that have a better defense with my shoes on. So it's a difference between like grappling with g Nogi is or that kind of a thing. Yeah, I mean I, so in college I shot high singles, that's what I shot at shoot a high single and got tried to turn and kick out catches shoe and then take us back and MMA guy turns and kicks out all the time. So high single eggs not going to work anymore.

Speaker 3:          01:19:03       So yeah, I mean like with, with the G on, you can't get away with certain things. You can't just slip out of a, a submission can just slip out of an arm bar and roll out of it. You actually have to have the real technique of getting out of it. If this guy is so good at it, you know, so yeah, it's, it's learning you to do the defense the right way instead of using the cheat moves. You know? That's interesting. Does it, um, was it, would it be okay if you did it with no shoes on and your opponent? I did it with shoes on because that way you would have the slipperiness of being careful wrestling against the kid that I knew it was coming in from like a college and he's really good. I am not wearing shoes. I don't care. I'm not going to wear it.

Speaker 3:          01:19:37       She was like Chad Mendez, like one of the best wrestlers in the world at practice. He'll never ever wear shoes. Now he doesn't, his defense is ridiculous. He just pushes you off his leg. Like the way he'll stand now too is because he'll only let you shoot a single day cause he knows how easy it is to get out of it. And uh, he'll, he'll never ever wear shoes again. Wrestling ever since grappling though, don't you think the, the, the injuries, the twisting niece come from shoes wearing shoes because a lot of guys, they do it on the wrestling mat and that's still okay because it might slip a little bit about as soon as you step on the judo mat, which you're planting

Speaker 6:          01:20:08       your feet and then with upper body motion rotation, something's going to twist because a lot of injuries happened with wrestling, right?

Speaker 3:          01:20:14       Yeah. You've got to get better. You've got a bit of traction. So you gotta know. I mean, I got to know what you're, I mean, I've wrestled my entire life positioning with wrestling shoes on and stuff, but I think it creates better habits to have your shoes on while wrestling. You know, cause you're not going to be able to get away with the, we call it a stinky lake where you just whip your leg out. You know, if I have a grip and it's what you want is to grip above your knee. But as soon as I get your grip below my knee just by pushing it down, I'm out. I'm just sliding my leg. It's gotta be a similar situation to wearing gloves, right? Like when trying to limp arm at a certain positions you have and you kind of, it gets, it's really hard to finish two clubs on any kind of grappling we do at elevation is with our gloves on. You know, cause I'm catching certain moves and risks. I can risk ride differently. Um, I could chokes are different. I can't cite it as easy behind your head. You got to learn all those things with, with gloves on as well.

Speaker 6:          01:20:59       Some people think that it would be a safer sport without gloves. Probably going to be less whole bloody lot more blood, more grown up my bloody, that's the thing. The guts and everything and to breaking hands. Yeah. But you would learn a lot more effective striking look, you really couldn't just unload on a guy and just hit anything.

Speaker 3:          01:21:21       Ross, I was up training with Tristar. He's like, Hey, I recommend at least once a day, once every other day hitting them back with no gloves on, you know, get that proper technique of no one had a hit, something with no gloves on. So you don't have that padding and protecting. If I've got a 16 or a 10 ounce glove, I'm able to just go away on my bag and punching as hard as they want it. I don't have to punch. Right. But if I don't have gloves on and I'm hitting that as hard as I can, I have to hit it correct. They have to have your right knuckle policemen to put it on that bag.

Speaker 6:          01:21:44       I mean that's what a lot of karate and traditional martial arts guys believe. They believe that those gloves are actually giving you the soul sort of false sense of, of your abilities, you know, cause your, your risks are all wrapped up. Your hands are all wrapped up. You know, you get the question, how many times did he break his hands in a street fight? All the time. Mitch blood green because they perfectly tape his hands up and training and then when he had to it has to hit without on the other side, you know, hitting a bag and but because if you do it wrong, like if you're hitting a bag, bare knuckle, because I had a guy who told me my, my coach is really good coach because she lets us hit the back until our hands bleed. I say you'll coach is an idiot.

Speaker 6:          01:22:21       That's what your coaches, because if this happens for weeks before to fly, I'd guess what's going to happen every single word, God, when you hit, you're going to reopen the cuts. It's going to hurt every first. Oh for your workout, right? Yeah. So yeah, if you do it perfect and the impact of spirit, but as soon as she hit and you slide a little bit, then you shave a knuckle love. Well four weeks before the fight, that's not going to heal anymore because you have reopen it every time. One of the interesting things about MMA is how we're still kind of learning and there's no right approach for everybody. Everybody's approach is definitely the approach for Damien Maia is going to be different than the approach for wonderboy is going to be different than your approach. And it's, it's so difficult to figure out who's right. I mean it's really based on the success of the past. Well, if we take away the gloves and turn into wonder

Speaker 5:          01:23:06       boys kicking with Damien, Maia is grappling. If we take where the gloves, well there'll be a lot more chill, a lot more jokes and a lot more kicks. You got to take away the gloves. There we go. Yeah, I mean it'd be, it's so much easier to sync. Chokes in so much harder as defend, you know, change up the commands. And then now when it comes to like if you look at football or baseball or any professional sport, they've pretty much have protocols that are very similar. Like most teams have pretty similar protocols as far as like training and how they, how they prepare their athletes. But with mma it's wildly different. Like in how, who, how, who decides? Like for you, who decides what when you're doing strength and conditioning, when you're doing hill sprints, when you're doing sparring, like how do you guys work that out?

Speaker 3:          01:23:50       I find someone that I trust completely and then uh, work together with him for my striking in my mma with Dwayne. It's something we team up together and think of like, what if I do this? What if I do that? And it kind of make a perfect plan for myself, my strength conditioning coach learning and Dow, I believe in him completely of watching him train athletes and peak in meet the right way and how I feel personally. It's all trial and error. Um, you know where I'm at right now. I trust in every single coach that for different aspects leaser bowling for my wrestling. He's been around the game for so long and knows how fighting works that I'm going to trust him and my wrestling techniques and help him pick me apart. You know, Elliot Marshall's meant Jujitsu coach. I really believe in Colorado at elevation fight team with me and Dwayne, we really got got a pretty, pretty good to figure it out. But someone's going to come in and have a different mindset of what they want to do. And if it doesn't work for you, it doesn't work for you.

Speaker 5:          01:24:36       Yeah. It's just, it's the trial and error and the learning as you go along. It's so interesting because, you know, you lose a fight and then you go, God, what, what did we fuck up on? Where, what do we need to do better? Yeah. And then, you know, maybe, you know, you get that Joe Silva call like, Hey, you know, uh, we have a fight in eight weeks. You Ready? Ready to take it? So Sylvia called me when I was up on a ladder doing electrical work in the mountains to fight in two weeks. And it was again, Jonathan Goulay. So, uh, I said, uh, sure. I take the fight and then I'd text boss right away or I call him and say, all right, can you train me? It's like, sure. His, so go out for a week. So yeah, going back to the point where I worked at West, is Keto in history ever.

Speaker 5:          01:25:13       You got it. Well, you got to fight for that money ever. We had a fight for that one. Yes sir. Mr Rogan, how many people were hating on him having the fastest Kaylin history? There's a lot of fucking debate. I was like the referee that it's wrong. It was, it was a wrong call. They were saying it was like 11 seconds or something like that. Sure. Like Bull Shit. That was six. We played it over and over and over again. It was fine. No, it's, we were working on that exact technique does point down the jab moving overhand right in the back with Sensei and and just just ripped it out, ripped it out and

Speaker 7:          01:25:42       it was so fun because I'm leaning over the cage and I'm saying Dwayne is going to come up straightforward. I want you to step to the side and just knock them out. You will hear me say that, repeating it over and over. I say, I don't know what because every time I have that I have one time I said he's opening for the right location and then the guy over through the right log, you get out. How do you know what? They have no clue. Every time it works with us or against boulevard, we knocked him out. That combination. We weren't

Speaker 5:          01:26:04       get the dressing room before Bomani. I mean it's all the time we'd Goulay for some reason I go, he's got to come straight out. You just move out and just don't do anything. It's Kinda data chunking. You've seen so many fights, so many people you have to see things and you don't even know what you're seeing. Just like, oh like you know how sometimes like you'll see a guy like I call it all the time. I'll see a guy lifted his heel up and when he said about throw right case. Yeah, like you just know for whatever reason twist a little bit. Yeah. Then the funny part is when he does a backache, nine out of 10 times, the other one throws a backache. So I always thought I'm going to do this on purpose and hopefully when he makes them on I'm going to catch it.

Speaker 5:          01:26:40       Then I'll go do this too. It's crazy when people throw back. Well, like the, the probably the most ill advised back heck of all time was Chris Weidman versus Luke Rocco. Maybe the most that called. It's called at the moment. What do you mean his corner? Call it at the moment he called it, I think maybe it's here's luke had been knocked out by veto with a wheel kick. So maybe I'm just guessing that Chris decided to throw a wheel kick, but it was like you could see it comment, it wasn't fast and if you don't know 100% how to cake, I said don't kick and he shouldn't have done that. It was way too slow and they saw it coming off. A memory of that though when, ah, be toward Belford did it? Um, I think I remember correctly rockhold was against the cage. Correct? Cause he's all circle off.

Speaker 5:          01:27:29       Yes. He was aware of the cage. Now weidman's back was against the kitsch. I thought he was close with the cage then luke was in that fight. I don't believe so. No, I believe he was moving. It was a belief. It was the same thing. He was moving towards rockhold on, I don't remember that direction, but I remember the talk them through it before and it was the first time I'd ever seen him throw a wheel kick. He threw it right before against rockhold and missed and they threw it again and landed them. Nice. Yep. TRT Tour.

Speaker 5:          01:27:58       He told me before, he says, boss, my kicks should go to be getting a really good right now, somebody out with a spinning back kick to the head. I said, go for it then. Then he knocked him out. So Vito has had so many hand surgeries, I believe he's had a sucker off for enhanced surgeries. He's broken his hand so many times that I think he just started concentrating more on kicks, you know, just see that made a big difference. This is going back to a patterns and seeing people that the hill up, you know, they're gonna throw something. Well, figure out what they're going to do. But then that same theory is paying attention to what combinations and what techniques actually land and then chucking those together and making those, the system. So just being, having, going back to the language and the vocabulary of high percentage combinations, drill them and wrap them out. So just it's not too bad. Yeah. And know how to really deliver a technique before you attempt it. Like the first time I ever saw Cain Velasquez for a wheel kick ever was in the Travis Brown fight and it looked fucking perfect. Cause like what does this guy have been hiding this forever? Like he never threw a wheel kick and all of a sudden it's a perfect, we'll kick. But it's probably because he had practiced them this and drilled it to the point where he's got it down. It's like all right, time to the wheel kick. You

Speaker 6:          01:29:02       had a lifeline. He has a lifelong martial artist in his corner, however you're going this. So I'm sure he's seen a million back kicks and can correct him on what to do properly rather than, than what he's doing wrong. But it's just, it was, it's interesting when you see a guy like out of nowhere. Yes sir. Hold technique that you've never seen before. Hi. Hello athletes. I can show tj anything. Right or watch videos and see something. He could pull it off right away. It's a great visual learner. I'm a great visual learner. So sensei is like, I can learn by watching papes and watching somebody do something. I can just mimic it. So and Tj, so consensus. It's just the way it is. I wonder what the next technique that we're going to see that we couldn't believe someone's pulling off inside the entre.

Speaker 6:          01:29:36       Yeah, it really close line with disclosure and elbows to the, to the, to the collarbone. I saw some of the Atlanta close line recently do that. That's fine. It's going to be over. I saw someone do that and I was thinking of you because you've talked about that so many times that like oh your bag. They attached to a US both on to twitter feed, right? It wasn't turned to somebody. Yes. Is it close side, but the coolest nine if you really do it, they can cover up with their hands but you're still going to hit him. You loop around and your rope around to the back of the head, which still outside the Mohawk still illegal pudge. Oh yeah. I know her feed is completed and Eagle, he moved his head and our didn't move his head and it's his fault. Well also, you know, Eddie Bravo and I had a conversation about this, like when you hit a guy with a head kick a lot of times is landing on the back of the hat.

Speaker 6:          01:30:18       Yeah. A lot of times the food, it's coming over the shoulder a lot of times, like the, the foot is impacting the instep is hitting the back of the head before anything and nobody's ready for that impact. Everybody in fact ready for the sites and to the front, uh, which, uh, Tyson, he hits hooks. He was always the smallest guy, shortest guy. But he would hit his hook almost to the Becca, a hat. Here's which was so short at that, you know, you, I always say, do you know, just hit yourself really gentle and to be, but the palm and the back of your head, your brain is simply not ready for that. Yeah. I'm one of the best head kick Kaos I've ever seen that came from the back of the head. Was there Nesto who's versus Maury Smith? I did. You ever see that?

Speaker 6:          01:30:54       Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Jamie find that because it's such a crazy combination. The way host gets his leg up there in the middle of a clinch and Maurice I believe, picks his knee up and host comes over the top and down behind his head. Sexual judge era style. Yeah. He just did a seminar kicking over to defense. Yeah, right there and it's like what you say before is say you take a punch it and put it on the head. You're going to let me just hit the punishment. Like if you have your hands up, it makes no sense. Yeah. Having your hands up. You think the guys protected. Now don't punch him. Put your hands up. Let me punch you. Let me touch your hands. Right, right. I've always got a kick blocked my kid. Come on. It's a misconception of people when they put their hands up, but this is what goes on. If I want to hitch Kikuyu into hat today, she put your hand up. A normal person automatically thinks the power of the kick because he sees his defendant, but if he just would not care and just kick as hard as she can on the defense, you will kick them out and it just got to knock them out. Let this last weekend we saw a Yancey Madeiros fraud. Sean Spencer's Spencer blocked the kick and he took it right to the, to the head. Check this out real quick. This is a Maury Smith versus Ernesto

Speaker 5:          01:32:00       who's play it, play the whole thing so he could see that the combination seat, boom, he does it in the clench with the knee boone's add edesa rumbled, deckers kind of style and I like the push and the cake that ahead. He started with that at all. It was able to bring it up in a round like that too. It's crazy to realize he was in the clinch, a block to shoulder, almost his hand down for him. Yeah. It kind of guides his hand out of the way. So was kicks in to come up and lay me in the head. That's also where like flexibility is so critical, like there's no more important thing when it comes to kicking technique. Then flexibility, because if you don't have the flexibility, your body's all stiff and it doesn't move. Right and you just can't. There's no, no one's going to do that unless it, you're flexible.

Speaker 5:          01:32:42       Yeah. Got a stretch. Can I do the stretch your routine? It was such a good guy. This who is that one Croatian do? They kept knocking him out. Yeah. That fucking guy hits the animal. They know his gay was the first gay porn champion. He was announced. That's right. Yeah. It's not the k. He knocked him out yesterday. Yeah, his muscles also, when you see it, he's like different kind of muscle. It almost looks like it is very strong. Know there's some dudes like that. Yeah. There's a long time for him to do to break the ice with me at a, suddenly he came to me and he goes, you're a funny guy. But if took like four times of meeting him, he was, he had no clue what to expect. That's a hard part of the world. There is a hard part of the world. I'll probably talk to relax. You got to be on guard the whole time. I think to this day, the greatest stare down of all time was cro cop versus vandelay and vandelay would mean mug everybody and it would work. He looked at Cro, cop and Cro. Cop looked at him like, motherfucker, I'll cut your head off. It was like, oh, he's dead.

Speaker 5:          01:33:51       The second fight, that was the second fight. But in the first fight, I mean you never saw the eyes of a killer more than than that, that one time. Cause I mean, I mean he was ahead of an anti terrorist squadron and Croatia. I mean, but you see I go back again. That was defended late, always intimidating somebody. And now you have suddenly a guy who does not care. He's not only that, your strong suit is striking and you're taking on one of the most explosive structures to ever compete in MMA. And a guy who, you know was a legit k one level striker. Yup. But he would say, you know, it's interesting how that, that style really worked really well. Like here it is likely the stare down, look at Cro cop, they get fuck it stared out. I mean that's God damn terrifying and I'm leaving and they're legit as fuck. He's not believing in vandelay very much. But it's interesting because Cro cop was successful in k one but he was never the elite of the elite. But his style, that explosive one shot style translated so well to mma. Whereas maybe like Ernesto style would not have translated that way because he was more technical,

Speaker 6:          01:34:58       set things up more. What I show, no single kicks. I always say, because they can be countered and I always say, are you kick like Mirko Cro Cop? Because if you then kick really hard on the defense, you're buying yourself a little bit more time because they, you force them to block it. But some of these guys with the left kicks, if they're the, they're the orthodox, they can't kick. I say take the cake, whatever it is. You're going to give you a rashy. I mean, he's not going to do anything. It's they're going to keep muscle. Just counter the cake. Well, when cro complicates of full blast Gig, you're going to be forced to block and then you can counter, which buys him a little bit of time to get out of the way again, that tells tj and his last ride of the sensee. I'll just wait for the kick in step in until the cross time him on the way in.

Speaker 6:          01:35:34       There's levels to everything, right, and there's levels to kicking and Edson Barboza switch kick is yes. That's one of those things where I watched that and I go, what the fuck? I'm never seen anybody switch kicked that fast. Quick, which is inside leg kick. He can win a whole fight with all benny. The jet, a spinning back kick to the body. Oh, he's back into the body one. It gets Fujiwara. I mean I saw it at the of his kings of the square ring. When you see him, you can hear the impact on the bud. It goes, you see the guy crumble. Benny. The jet was sad motherfucker. The best American kickbox forever. Yeah, he's a bar without a doubt. One of them told him and then I would say Rick Rufus, such a pioneer too. I mean, you know shit. He was doing that back when there was really no one at that level.

Speaker 6:          01:36:25       I mean he was at such a high level. It's such a while due to again Mexican, native American. It was dizzy. Oh is he? Or maybe a mix, but I'm pretty soon cause he's a come out with the headdress. Blinky Rodriguez, who was his brother in law was Mexican. I saw him in Holland coming in. He was fighting spotting. He wants Bong. It was a big bike guy. Strong, strong kickboxer and Ben, he never fought with low kicks and spying is murdering him. And the first right, everybody's for spying spine go wgu going and he gets loci. LOCI cause I don't know how he stayed in the fight, Benny, right. The second five second route, he starts coming in a little bit and there was five frauds. Five to the time because Thai boxing and a third two out and now better jeff starts coming back and suddenly spunks that spitting out his mouthpiece because he needed an extra break and I need it again.

Speaker 6:          01:37:13       And it did it again. And then it was like rocky versus Ivan Drago you. So literally the whole audience changed from being for the Dutch guy to be for betty to jet because they realized this guy is so tough. But he keeps hanging in there and then betty jet stopped them into forthright. It was the craziest thing. People were going nuts. If you spit out as a mouthpiece, he wants spunk. Everybody. Whoa. You know, he wasn't doing heroin. It was the coolest thing I've ever seen. Did you watch glory this weekend? No, but I heard it was really good. Right? And waste and wilderness knocked out Simon Marcus. Oh Wow. And Marcus was lighten them up early in the fight. Light a mosque. He's like 44 and two right. Mark has showed that though. Three of them right now. Yeah, he lost to shilling and that crazy

Speaker 2:          01:37:56       fight where they went that extra round. And schilling knocked him out with a right hook, which is just, it was an insane fight. That was the tournament too. That was the first fight of that tournament and Schilling for two more times after that fucking crazy fight. But the, uh, the wilderness fight, Simon markets was lightened him up, man with Moy Thai and wellness is more of a boxer style and he was moving in and he had some, some success with combinations, but then he caught him at the end of the round a way that with a shot and uh, Simon mark was kind of playing with them and lowered his hands, was smiling and he got hit with a couple of shots and the referee gave him a real questionable standing eight count. And the, the, the commentators are screaming, Joseph Valtellina, he was screaming like, that's ridiculous. They shouldn't do this. Is that, that's not a, the eight counts. No good. He wasn't about to go down. There's no standing eight count and kickboxing. Like why did they count them? Like they're saying that the, the ropes held them up. Then the next round wellness just fucking dropped him legit and hurt him bad and then dropped him again and then finish them off

Speaker 6:          01:38:53       for Uber. I'm looking forward to him fighting Butler December 10th right. God Damn. That's going to be nuts. Badr Hari is one of the scariest motherfuckers ever walked the face of the planet. I have no clue how he's still out of jail. Out of jail. I guess he's got money. It ain't cause they said it was maybe going to be in Morocco. I go, don't do it in Morocco. Do it because if you beat him, that's got to be a problem, I think. Yeah. Yeah. Didn't he rob a bank, right? No, no, no, no. Let him beat up Morocco, but okay. Okay. Sorry. Brass knuckles. I, my story is better

Speaker 2:          01:39:34       beat some guy up at a nightclub where he stomped his shin, the, they held a guy down and he's allegedly stomped on his shin and snapped it in half.

Speaker 6:          01:39:44       Yeah. That's not being a good person, you know, and like Tan and I think that's what he was going forward. But I don't think so. Stories like that. Do you have many of them from him? That's not good. Not Good.

Speaker 2:          01:39:57       Obviously I'm a huge fan of MMA. I think the Nima Amaze the most exciting sport in the world. But there's some things that you see in kickboxing that you just don't see in mma because there's no threat of the tank down. So you see these wild technical exchanges and in my opinion, we need more of that. You know, it just is not enough. There's not enough eyes on it. Just don't think enough people are paying attention.

Speaker 6:          01:40:18       Phenomenal show glory. It is phenomenal now. That's why I don't understand the numbers have a why he's not, not many more people watching it. And especially the guys who are complaining about not understanding mixed martial arts. Well, the punch you can gigging, everybody can understand that. And like 85 or 85% knockout ratio. Yes sir. Yeah, it's a great show.

Speaker 2:          01:40:38       I Love Glory, but I like lion fight better. I like traditional ties. I just feel like glory would be even better if they just went more Thai. Because why? Why take away elbows when widen. Why no elbows? Ah, I'm not a big fan elvis just because of the cuts cuts too easy.

Speaker 5:          01:40:53       Um, but then also limiting the clinch time cause the crunch time can be boring. Right. So I think like the k one rules are more, I liked the Cuban roles or Gloria rules better for that aspect. For the handpiece fight, but or just a in the clinch keep abos but in the clinch, just a don't allow them to play around, play around as long. See, I understand what you're saying about elbows, but part of me is like, look, it's a striking contest. Why would you eliminate one of the best weapons in striking, which is elbows and lion fight has these, I mean, look, they get caught up like for sure. Like do you see Gaston Balano since on one of his face Ninja, he gets cut the fuck up. His opponents cut the fuck up. They're blasting each other with spinning elbows. But it's fun as hell to watch. Yeah, definitely fun to watch. I'm not trying to be in there anymore at all.

Speaker 5:          01:41:39       Much easier just to quit coaching Tj and coaching the guys and teach them martial arts and evening what I want and hanging out. I totally respect that. I just think like as a person who appreciates the purity of the art, I just feel like there's no reason to take out those clinch battles and there's no reason to take out those elbows because the guys who are good at those clinch battles, you know, they just start fucking blasting each other with knees to the body and it has a significant tall and then the elbow battles that they have inside the clinch. It to me it's a, it's a really important part of the world. Stand up striking. I see that. Yes sir. Agreed. We had a, we were talking about earlier, 600 euro. He just did a seminar at my academy and he showed us really cool clinch elbow knee techniques.

Speaker 5:          01:42:21       It was nice to get it from an actual pure Muay Thai fighter to see his look and his perspective of what can happen in the clinch knot. That was, that was eye opening. It was cool. Yeah. I think if we didn't have those guys, we wouldn't know that we will. We would have only the level of striking that we see in mma. And I think, you know, when you go and you watch like, uh, Ramon dekkers fuck, you know, you watch like him in his prime and you realize, okay, this is possible. Like there's, there's levels to this fucking thing. Oh, Jordan mean, right. Yeah. His elbows. Oh Man. Retired hired.

Speaker 6:          01:42:54       Yeah, no, he's coming back. He is, I heard, yeah, I talked to his father was a, it was the Boston then this the most so, yeah. And uh, he told me he's going to be back here. He's a black phone interview, right? Yup. It's Paul as a fucking savage. There's a picture of him on his instagram page is like fifties pucker. Yeah. Jordan is a very, very talented guy. But um, he had so many fights, you know, as a young man. I mean, I think there's only 24, 25 and he retired. Right. That's what I tell everybody this because they start competing too young. He competed when he was 15, 16 years old. They have to lie about his age. You know, you're going to burn out. You shouldn't do that. Everybody's asking me. I'd met this a girl now in a Phi Zalea 12 year old Jenna.

Speaker 6:          01:43:35       Um, it started the following year. I sent us to a whole bunch of gear and stuff, you know, I said, because she says, watch me, I'm going to be the next Ronda Rousey. So I go, Hey, I want to say that, but it's, you know, it's the training. It's uh, I, I told her start sparring maybe when you're 15 years old, wait with that, because your brain is still everything through your nerves, you know, at that age. And it stops at 14. Just give it two more years, you know, till all the connections are there. And that may be start sparring by competing. I would just wait, wait for competing. Don't go in this early, do Jujitsu, wrestling, do all that. But striking to the head, I think they should wait with that. Even even doing those things at a young age and you make sure they're fun.

Speaker 6:          01:44:11       You know, like I almost got burnt out in wrestling in eighth grade. I wanted to quit. I want to be done with the rest of this too much. It was just because every weekend I'm competing in that. I'm so nervous as a little kid, I'm putting so much pressure on myself. They're like, I got to win this term. I got to do good. I like my dad was my coach. I wanted to impress him. All this stuff, you know, it's like eighth grade. I was almost just gave it up, you know? But you got to learn to learn to have fun with everything. As long as everything's fun, like you can compete, do all that stuff. I mean obviously kickboxing's little bit different because you're going to go in through some a brain trauma. But what, even with the wrestling and Jujitsu, make sure it's fine if you've got a little kid that wants to do and a or a little kid that wants to get involved in grappling and wrestling.

Speaker 6:          01:44:44       Make sure it's fun. You know, go in and practice playing some games, news and things as well as learning technique and cause little kids will get burned out way too fast because we hit it as striking a lot, right? Aka to let striking to get injuries and injuries down. How many times should we spar whispbar two times a day. Do we ever get injured and we go, if people watch, they go to go, oh, these guys are crazy, but we know exactly what we hit, where we kick it. It's all about sparring partners. Now if you decide to your great part, sparring partner doesn't show up and you get somebody from the club somewhere. Yeah. Who has this? We at you doesn't. It's not as professional. Yeah, you get injured, but I never been injured. Inspiring and we give bus route and settled down. But same with you.

Speaker 6:          01:45:31       You'll never get an engine. We will explore. What did you think about cowboys? Serone deciding no more sparring. He doesn't spar. He just does drills. You're talking about that and look sensational. In his last fight. He looks at a station will, because he's still, he, he still was sparring before that, you know, it's closer, but the fruit of your stairway, it's like a lawler. He said he never spotted. Finally he started sparring. He started sparring. Any became much better. See, I look at that. I think your reflects his knee. Reflexes need to be tested all the time. If you're going to fight, well then you're going to have to fight in training because that's what's got to happen. Unexpected things, unexpected techniques. You know, you need to be prepared for that. If you just spar, you don't know what I'm going to throw at you. You get three show lies a counter on my right straight. Well what if I set it up as a one, two instead of just the right straight? Yes.

Speaker 4:          01:46:17       With that being said, sorry. Um, is, is if we're talking about sparring, but it's not just full on fight sparring, but there's a whole level of sparring drills that you can play with the mimics scenarios. Going back to the patterns, right. And like what's a typical pattern? The Jab Cross, there were low kick learning how to deal with those things in the motion. But while you're doing that, Joel, yet to had the clear mind like you're in the fight, but know that you're going to be here to be countering the jab. You're sending somebody up with a jab, but not just going in finding guys, I don't want this to be misled where everyone's just fighting and sparring hard, but to do actual sparring drills because there's a full path between hitting myths and actual sparring and then that's the web of the sparring drills.

Speaker 3:          01:46:50       Yeah. I think cowboy also had an issue with cutting the weight too. Yes sir. Then he looks cut 70 cutting weight was just too much for him at one seven he's a fucking assassin. I feel like we're so good at the one seven and there's a lot less pressure on me at first too. You know, you got to go into a fight with just having fun and not thinking about like, I'm supposed to win this fight for him and he's going to a complete different weight class. What is there to lose? You know? And so I think that's what's helped him out a lot too. And I think he's kind of catching his groove. He looked awesome that, yeah,

Speaker 6:          01:47:15       right. The body left Duke, right. I kick, I love it. Anyone all full hits. If you sought a body shot, I dug in there. Right. And then wrap it up at the high kick. I love the, and the technique, that technical aspect that was so, there was no wind up. There's no fucking no muscle behind it. Everything's just perfect crack head kick. It was just God damn

Speaker 4:          01:47:35       as far as developing somebody a, I used to help him out when he was first training in Colorado and he was so wrapped up into his own style. I would try to say, no, do this and do that. But then I realized, look, he even everyone needs to be their own athlete. You know, you got to do what's, what's good for you. It feels natural. Go ahead. But um, and then he's just a prime example of someone you'd have to allow to be themselves, you know, but just kind of guide a little bit here and there. But you know, he went down to Jackson's and liquid. He's done. He's, he's amazing. He's such an individual trying to, we all are. Yeah. Cowboy and some other boxes. He's just, he's a fucking wild man. W have yet. Who's the weirdest guy you've ever worked with? Where you like, Jesus, I don't even know if I could

Speaker 6:          01:48:09       and help this guy a favor. Favor. Yeah. Yeah,

Speaker 3:          01:48:17       he does. But he's not going to try to learn new things.

Speaker 4:          01:48:19       Yeah. He sat in the past, so you know, I gotta respect that. And you've been successful. There you go. But the game has changed. Now look at the results. The game has changed. You have to change along with it. Like the definition of insanity is doing the same thing, expecting different results. You have to evolve. We have to let the ego go and continue to develop and train and learn. The has to happen. Would you guys had personality conflicts for whatever reason, you know, no blame, but whatever they were, you guys had. But what was, it was a great time when we were together. Like, look what happened. Look what flourish, right? Yeah. I became much mellor much better as a martial art instructor, being able to work with all the athletes. Right? Everyone, we work together, everybody rose. So it was a good time as good wind when it worked out for me to go home and do my own thing and uh, things laid where they were. Yeah.

Speaker 6:          01:48:59       You asked you about why you know him as a good coach and the reason of that is what I already mentioned with the training. He's always there. He's always there on time. He always goes full out and that work ethic he took to be a coach. He will always be there with the guys cutting way to doing everything. I guarantee you they can call you at three o'clock in the middle of the night, the day before to fight. Don't go, just give me 30 seconds. But that's it. That's it. If you have that drive and you are so focused on one thing and he just put that focus, that's right.

Speaker 3:          01:49:31       I'll be training all day long. I'll get home and want to just like relax. Vego may watch some TV, just do nothing. Right. And then maybe be like 12 o'clock at night. I'll get a text from duane like on something on my fight, what I should be doing, what should be thinking about. I'm like, yeah,

Speaker 6:          01:49:43       guys, sorry. Yeah, it does not have to think about this all night, so he's the reason

Speaker 2:          01:49:48       why he's so great. He's like you said, he's constantly thinking about it and he cares how well I do. Before you fought Hanan Barao. I was eating lunch in Vegas at the hotel. I had a bunch of my friends with me. We're all getting ready for the fights. Dwayne comes over, hey man, come on. Sit down. How are you feeling? How's your boom? Sits down and just, we're going to do this, blah, blah, blah, blah. I'm just going to stop. The whole thing is movement switches to get to the side, the whole thing. A brow browse his style. It's his style. He's going to his and he just was fucking hundred miles an hour and they're sitting there putting food on. My Mom's gone and then he and me. Yeah, that's right. Yeah. That was still got the same.

Speaker 2:          01:50:28       This is good. This is good. This is good. Boom. That's why you're so fucking good. You know? And I don't like the term ocd man. Obsessed. I've dedicated my life to the arts. I'll OCD is those weirdos washed her hands a hundred times before you leave the house. This is a different thing. This is just, it's a positive session. Yes sir. Yeah. I've dedicated my life to the arts. Oh Man. So it's fun. I love it. Yeah. Pretty much everybody at this table has, your method though is so uniquely Duane and I really love your system. I think that's so critical, is that you've taken all your stuff and you've written it out and you put it into like this system where you can really learn. And that's something that I learned from rob came into the Cayman tapes who's amazing. He has a system and it's one of the things that I learned when I, when I was training with him, it's like this guy has this system the same way a lot of Jujitsu guys have a system, you know, and it's like his, his system of breaking things down and movement and strikes that it's all like, it's, it's all uh, it has a pattern to us and you can follow this pattern as a progression to it.

Speaker 2:          01:51:34       And with the way the world is today, you can learn it all from him online. You know, like he's so good at breaking things down and build a to film it and show it to people that I can, you can go on as online academy and learn exactly what I'm doing. You know, all you need is a willing yeah. Participants. So I want to train with you is going to do the same amount of work that you are. Yep. Agreed. Yeah, it's fun. I love it. I definitely love it. It gives me thrive and passion and a purpose, you know, to put energy in to other humans and to watch them flourish and grow. And get better. And that's a feedback for me. It's obvious. It might be just doing it for myself, but it's a good service back first. But yeah, I lived to see people do good. Well I'm glad you're around dude. Cause it makes me sad. It makes it interesting. And this is such a suck, a fucking exciting time for MMA. Match is so much good. Shit is going on. Life is you. You love and doing that show though, the mma show

Speaker 7:          01:52:19       last time yet though, I heard you. When I'm on a broadcasting, uh, you're talking about the different levels of knocked down. Right. And we had herb Dean and big John McCarthy, Joe McCarthy was talking about the five levels of a nug down. You know, once you start staggering when she full back, when she crawled away, there's all different sites, you know, and I think that, I love those compensation, you know, the round table, sit down with some professionals and talk about problems that we have right now and then figuring it out. And I

Speaker 6:          01:52:46       love that. And the show all, she was great that she knew talent when I called them mcgregor in the beginning we had him on, you know, so we see these guys come on the show, but also once a while we guys are Mark Coleman or you know, or don fry. You know, I see my old buddies again. It's, it's just a fun show pass. Before you got here, we were talking about Ipos and we showed the Fabricio Werdum Travis Brown. I poked. Did you see that? Have you seen it? Yeah, I heard about it. Yeah. Fucking crazy. Like knuckle deep into different ratios. I what do you think could help that? What do you think could fix that? I think penalties. I truly believe so because if you look at pancreas, which was open and striking, we never stabbed each other in the eye. [inaudible] how is that even possible? Right.

Speaker 6:          01:53:24       So now because we are cha hands backwards because we want to hit with the palm and, and it's just a fact when it happens, it won't happen in training. Right. And, and, and especially not at that cap. Oh No, not anymore. Of course we've got a, if they come from Greg Jackson winkle, John, I would say, well my Greg John lost an eye, you know, and uh, w with a neil it wetter as it was a foot neil. Okay. Tonio but, but still, you know, pads for some money holding paths. That's what happens. Very dangerous. Yeah. No, but I think once you say, listen, if you're known to do that, uh, did it happened with you in the past? Referee should be allowed to go before there. He say, listen, when I poke I'm going to give you a red card. And I think that will, that will stop it because people are going to get more, become more careful.

Speaker 6:          01:54:06       We Red card, which in pride with costs you a 10% of year, 10% perse. I think the point deduction, I think one point every time I think, uh, you know, no warnings for an ipod because you take, I think the gloves too. But I think that if you, even if you take a point away from a guy, like if you warn them like that person you poked in the eye is still damaged by that. And so even if he says it's an accident, like it doesn't matter one point either way, even though it's an accident. What I'm saying, even if it's obviously an accident, if your fingers go in someone's eye and you know it's going to cause a point, everyone is going to curl their knuckles back even more accountable for it. Yeah. Yes sir. I see that. Yes. The gloves, gloves and a penalties or a beating.

Speaker 6:          01:54:49       I hate to believe anybody's doing it on purpose, but someone must be doing it on purpose. Some I feel are kind of aware of that. There are some tactics for sure. You know, does, I mean how often is that happening in training? I don't know, but uh, it's, some of them do look deliberate. It's that kicks into pills. Crystal Sisinsky what's one time fighting and he got kicked six times, I believe. It might even be seven. And it feels, and he goes back to the colon or the balls. Liz and I go kick him back. Yeah, that's my answer. I said he's not getting a warning, so do it back then. He knows how it feels and it hopefully he's going to stop. But Chris of is too nice of a guy. He didn't do it. There's a few fights where you go, Ooh, I got to wonder why not.

Speaker 6:          01:55:29       If that's purpose on purpose rather. Um, did you see a check Congo versus Cro cop? Oh yeah. Waylay them in the sack. Wham. Like more than once. I mean it was several, several good blows. Most of the time it's bad technique most of the times with the lead leg and they don't step open to right foot. So the angle cannot go, uh, like a 90 degree angle into the muscle and it gets straight up. It'd be, she goes, look, look, if everybody who gets kicked to the pills, I guarantee you the leg that they're standing on the toes are pointing forward. If they will point to decide, it will be okay. Well with check. I believe it was knees in the clinch. Oh, it was, I think it was just right. Yeah. A Thai boxer shoot noted. I never need anybody to build. I did once actually, but that was on purpose.

Speaker 6:          01:56:13       I guess renee, Rosie, I, if I could fight video from that, that is the best dealer. So I fight where they, Rosie, you heard about that, right? The tall guy from all a total psychopath, they say. And it does always illegal things. So we're fighting him and I'm the first ride. I beat the crap out of him in a second ride would come out and be a clinching and he bites in my ear and I'm shouting, let go, let go, let go. And then you see my knee going all the way back. Then I need him. He comes loose from the ground. That's how I knew him in the bill. He goes down and I wanted to attack him on the ground, but they pulled me off and then a core habits was in my corner. Now he brought all his friends who was like, he had hell's angels with him. And, and I had all, my boss was friends with me and they all started fighting. They throw us, they threw a chair into the ring. If bounce off core hammers says beck at leds behind me. If you see the video, man, it leds behind me. I looked behind me, I see the chair, I sit in the chair while I watched everybody.

Speaker 6:          01:57:09       And that later they cleared everybody. Everybody's throw it down because the referee took, he says, why did you do it? And I said, look at my ear. And it was a hole straight through my air. He bit straight through my year, a holding there. And then he grabbed a microphone and he announced to everybody and other, Whoa, he's got a hole in his ear. He bit his ear. That's why he did it. And then everybody calm down. Oh Wow. And did you continue to fight right?

Speaker 5:          01:57:29       No. No, no. That wasn't it. It was a hard knee. Wow. The wild, wild west. It was a good one. Eddie Bravo thinks he should be able to hit a guy in the back of the head. He thinks that when you take a guy's back, when the old days of mma, when a guy had two hooks in, you almost didn't go to the rear naked choke. He just blasted guy in the back of the head with the elbows. Yeah, that's right. But here we go again before rules. Right. Hands on. It was and so and yeah. What's his name from Holland? Like a sinker. Yeah. Judo Guy told me that guy was fucking with Enzo. Could call in his room calling his hotel room all night. So hands. I was like, oh, okay. All right. And did you see what he stepped on his face at the end?

Speaker 5:          01:58:15       Stepped on his face after he smashed him. That's what guys would do. They would take someone's back. Remember Health Gracie fought somebody, I forget who it was, but he got the hooks in and just boom, boom, boom. Right to the base of the skull and like, it's so affective though. I know. I do the same thing and keeps your spine impact right. Here it is. Here's Hanzo. Oh, nice. Oh, this is, this is a actually, okay, look at that cage. Yeah. Duct tape around it and so he gets his bags. He flattens them out and then here it comes. Boom, boom, boom, boom. Go to baby. Yeah. I mean data is the way to open up that choke man. You can't defend once someone starts raining, those elbows down and you know you can cover that shit up all you want. Now he's tapping. No, watch this.

Speaker 5:          01:59:02       Where did you go to wait, what he's going to do. He gets kicked. It gets up. It looks steps. That's right. That's my head world combat champion. That was, I think the state. Look at it. He helps him up. Hey, roll over on his head. We're pals now. People as well. Yeah. He beat the fuck out of that dude was a good one. That was I think the same event where Marillo bustamonte fought Tom Erickson and they fought. They fought for like fucking 90 minutes. It was one of those crazy fight. It was like a 45 minute fight. I think it was. Honestly, it was a crazy fight because they didn't have like an ending to those things. They didn't, you know, he just fought 90 minutes for suck up at Hawaii drowns. They did rounds. I don't think Marillo in Erickson did rounds. I think it was just one long er, I don't remember.

Speaker 5:          01:59:50       But I remember like Ericsson at the time, he's like the forgotten heavyweight. Like when he was in his prime, he was fucking terrifying cause he was a natural 300 pound go real low and enormous wrestler and he could hit so fucking hard. I remember he knocked out Kevin Randleman, he hit Kevin random and we're like, oh left hook and knocked him out. But it was like Jesus Christ, he was one of the scariest guys for his time, but just like kind of missed the window, you know, like he was really scary in the early days of MMA. Nobody wanted to fight him a month ago. Super tough man. What a great guy. And we tell him, Matt Lindland like nothing happened. I didn't tap. And they believe that a big John talked about that on our show. He said, yeah, that, that was a bad one for me because you know, I didn't see it.

Speaker 5:          02:00:41       And that's what people should understand at home. You know, dee dee, same as the referees, especially with Dina and big John just show invested. They loved the sports so much. There's so much, therefore the foot of fighters, so when they make a bad call, it hurts them as well, you know? But then to get the avalanche, avalanche of older people on the Internet, you know, come on, everybody's human. And people were talking about I believe four Colt or three Kohl's that they were talking about. Uh, her with herb dean, Herb Dean had over seven and a half thousand matches. He did. I go, I do all sound great. I like those off cody for mistakes in seven and a half thousand matches. You're doing a good job of both of those guys are the gold standard and John McCarthy, that's the gold standard. Everybody, I mean, you know who was really good before he went away for selling weed.

Speaker 5:          02:01:26       Josh Rosen, he did my last fight. He's very good. Very good. Crazy. Went away for something like that. So crazy. Well, you want to wait for selling weed, and he had a kind of little bit of an arsenal, legal Rahama, a little only 12 acres of wheat. They will have nothing wrong with that. It's just helping the world and the real problem was I believe guns were involved and that's a, that's when things, but yeah, look, you're going to sell weed illegal. You've got to be their protected. It's unfortunate. The whole thing is unfortunate, but he was a very good referee. Yup. Very good referee. Very good martial artist too. Yeah. He always tried and I sat and I respect that obviously to having people in the field who if you're going to work in the field, he should actually train in the fields. You should have just gone one day.

Speaker 5:          02:02:07       I to bring up to you, what did you think about the Travis Browne? Fabrizio Breeshia. We're doing five where we're travis called time. He got his finger jammed for Breeshia, threw a punch and travis is, travis has finger apparently broke and there's some photos of it now online. It was, it's fucking nasty. Like shows you how tough travis is that he continued with his finger was smashed and it was a compound fracture with the bone broke through the skin. That's one picture, but there's some even better ones that he released today. Well, you could see it, uh, after the fight. It was a nasty break, but so it was a weird thing where [inaudible] through this punch and he threw like one of those chocolate dell style over hands that come over the top and it landed on the fingers of Travis and snapped one of his finger. So Travis calls time, which you really can't do.

Speaker 5:          02:02:53       He's like, my fingers fucked up. He calls time like, wow, scroll up though. And you see it. The actual opening. Yeah. Here comes the boom. He says timeout. Right. Given James said he cannot do that. I Guess Marie Smith, did they stop? Did they go ahead and give me time? Sorry. Oh, that's right. You did that boss. You did that in a fight. Yeah, yeah, yeah. But Maurice, no, I d I liked that. Yeah. I kicked him in the head and then I got excited and wanted to give him another kick in the head, but I slip and a fall and to go out. Then Maurice wants to jump on top of me and I put my head up. I say, wait, and he stops and I'm getting up and I go, thank you. That's good closure trick and another one to help fetty funny anybody with the Jason to Lucia. I dropped it with his liver shot, right? And then I walked over to him. You see what I'm doing as stretch my arm above me and I wave with my head and you see him look it up to my head and then I live or kick him again. I just put my hand up and say, yeah, look at this. He actually looked there. That's good composure, right? We actually use that stuff all the time. The bird, the bird, so there's mastercard

Speaker 3:          02:04:03       sutong. He's my first striking coach. Had an Alpha male and a. When dwayne first started coming to teach at a alpha male, I was thinking was my second fight. You were there. We were in San Jose against a Hugo vianna and uh, we're in the hotel room day of the fight, just kind of hanging out, just waiting and mastered tongs just in the bed. He sleeps all day long. And then, uh, he's in the bed just hanging out. My dwayne comes to hang out with us and he's telling master, telling the story. Am I strong as I kind of like looking at him like he's paying attention but then it looks at Dwayne. He goes bird and weren't at a hotel room. Right. And doing like it looks over and look if there's a bird and as Dwayne back to start talking to him

Speaker 1:          02:04:38       again, he's rolled over on the bed and looking at the direction night and then sleeping. Look over there while I turn over and go to sleep cause I deal with the barrage of the, of the Ludwig I talking fast and doesn't understand it. So he turns around the fucking guy. He was supposed to corner Tj in that fight. She said, what's that? He was supposed to courtney you on that fight and we couldn't find the fucking guy, uh, about to walk out for my fight. And Master town's nowhere to be found. I'm like, what the hell? I'm going out to my fight. Where's the master Tong and in, so danny just corners me and after the fight I get back. You messed up. I was like, oh, tj. Uh, I go smoke way up in the rafters. So supposedly he says he went up into the rafters, this smoke his cigarette and he was too scared to get down so he couldn't come down to come corner. That's a great reason.

Speaker 1:          02:05:23       I'm in the room like the next day and I go say, well, don't wake, what the fuck were you ties and cigarettes or gambling or everything? I don't know. It's just so cold. Good fighters. Yeah, that smoked cigarettes. He was smoking while he's fine. I mean, that guy is so talented. It's crazy. I wish she, if he had half the work ethic, that Dwayne head, he'd be amazing. You know, he, he's such a good trainer. He's such a good fighter by justice. I Dunno man. He's such a freak though. Would see him in the corner with a tank top on and the gold, bunnings and sunglasses. Loving light side. Yeah. Big smiles on face. Suns out. Guns out. Yeah. Yeah. Big Ass belt buckle. And he would make sure to be in the camera for the decisions. He's like position himself so you can see him like he wants to be a superstar, you know. Isn't there like an issue with him gambling against one of your fighters against her favor? Apparently so. No, no, not [inaudible]. This is from the hills

Speaker 4:          02:06:19       Barao in New Jersey. It was both. It was me and Tom and I, and no one knows if this actually happened, right. But uh,

Speaker 1:          02:06:29       allegedly

Speaker 4:          02:06:29       he gambled on borow to beat Faber and he's cornering faber. Like what the fuck man. I go to New Jersey at the corner of my eye. I do two seminars. They, I get up super early, do two seminars before his fight, come back if I do everything I need to do. And then after the fights, uh, which apparently he gambled against favor. I'm leaving the hotel to go, I got to get up super early and take off to go back home and, and I'm, and I'm walking out down the hall and he's got a track record of hitting people up for money all the time, tongue and uh, easy an addict. He legitimately apparently has a problem gambling and not budgeting his shit. Right. So anyway, I fly to vague or flight to a New Jersey, do two seminars, corner. Like I'm just, I'm working my ass off.

Speaker 4:          02:07:10       I'm leaving the hotel after the fight now and the next morning and he's following me down the hotel it, oh, Dwayne, Dwayne, uh, uh, uh, uh, can I have a little bit of money and I'm like, and then I like I gave him the Cro cop stare. I was like, no, motherfucker. I got up early, came out here and work my ass off to seminars cornered and do what I needed to do while you were sleeping in. Don't ask me for money, motherfucker. Like I got genuinely mad cause he's just being lazy ass and asking me for. So, um,

Speaker 1:          02:07:36       I told him no, it's like that pool when he says you're the world's worst best friend, you know, he put it when you bet against him at the deadpool, but on the positive side master, Tom's a bad ass. So bad man. He's such a talented dude. Yeah, I know. It's, I think he is one of the best guys in the world. The holding mitts. Yeah. I wouldn't say he's like super structured and going to like, maybe it's like his understanding of English, you know, you can't like break something down. Like this is why you should do it and tell me like why I'm doing things and when to do it. And he just kind of shows you, he makes you do it on the mits without even you knowing it. He makes you do things you're supposed to do the right way just by holding him and having a very limited, limited vocabulary.

Speaker 1:          02:08:14       TJ A lot. Oh, here's my first trainer and I, I picked up on a stand up very quick with him and I think he's a great trainer. He's just an addict. I just got nasty Moitai tall dude. He's so, yeah, very good tie. And He's good. I love the guy, man. It's a problem. And when people would get that gambling bug, that's a scary book. That's the first Korea. I never did a good bug. I mean if you got a trainer, this betting against you, I'm as bad as it gets confirmed though. So master talking was coaching out in Texas. He's at a gym in Texas and that's when this, when Dwayne first got here, so masterone was kind of with her. I'm kind of mad and just kind of laughed and that's why we needed a new coach, you know, that's why I brought Duane in.

Speaker 1:          02:08:51       And then when favor was going to fight, Braley brought it back for eight weeks for his camp and he's out here training him. Favorite went in that fight with the herd. Hamstring and message. Chung knew that as well. Like he tore his hamstring a little bit and went into the fight, little injured. And so when my strong went back to Texas, he was bragging that he made $5,000 cause you bet all this money that favor wasn't going to win the fight and then it got back to favor because favor new the the trainer out in Texas. And so it came back to when we found out about it and you know, allegedly who knows if it's really true, but message was bragging about it, you know, that hurts. Well that's awesome guy. Yeah, you love him. I mean I love the guy, you know, and if I would come to find out, he bet against you. That's, that's rough. You know what if we gave you four one five and give you four but like that's what he's supposed to do. Listen dog, you know, and I know that you came into that fight a little fucked up. So like here's a taste. No, given the majority of it, right? Not even half most of it, but he still won 1000 bucks. People Gamble, product problem. Don't do that. I know.

Speaker 1:          02:09:50       Cause he had nothing to show for it afterwards. He guarantee went and gambled it somewhere else. I mean, he, when he was coaching it off from in the beginning before it ain't got there. I mean, he's making good money, you know? I know he's, he supports his family and stuff, but he should have had been a lot more well off than he was, you know? But he's in a, it's an addict. It's a serious problem, man. It's like you wouldn't have actually think that it's probably, it's, it's a serious problem. Goes back what I was telling my guys I'm doing for myself. You're going to create habits. Let them be good habits and I got that from Sensei. Pretty good habits, right? Yeah. Your habit is train like a motherfucker and teach like a motherfucker and get obsessed with that. I don't get obsessed with Black Jack. I invest in other humans. It's, it's weird once you gamble because you need it. You always lose trust. I enjoy gambling fights. I used

Speaker 5:          02:10:34       to do it all the time. When I first started working for the UFC, I would gamble on fights and then I was like, can I get in trouble for this? I was like, I wasn't sure. I was like, I'm not, can't affect the outcome.

Speaker 7:          02:10:43       You should. You should mention it before to fight. You say, I put my

Speaker 5:          02:10:47       money, I'm taking more enticing. People get mad at me though. Who the fuck bro? Right. Yeah, but what the fuck bro? The best is one of the time when Diego see you dig, oh Sanchez when a fight and then at the time here you're going to interview him. He's like, Hey, you told me all this weird before and you're like, yeah, you're weird. And then he was like, just got quiet because he tried to call you out, but you're like, yeah, that's a bad thing. Fuck. Have I seen this view before? He fought Joe Lowe's on and you will see 200 he was doing an interview before Joe Lozan had like this whole like hadn't been planned out. It was almost like a freestyle rap and put it on his instagram. It is one of the funniest interviews I, I wish I remember exactly who did it. He's so odd but awesome. Yeah. Awesome.

Speaker 7:          02:11:34       And a good thing about him, a long time ago dish before the ultimate fighter, this guy would send me video tapes from the East Coast and we did a note and he says, boss, I okay, this one I won, but I still can you break it down where I have to work on. And I would write everything down and send it back to him. And then I show him on the ultimate fighter and the later I met him in an in an elevator, I say, man, you always used to send me to take. She said, yeah, thank you very much. But you see, I really appreciated about a guy like that.

Speaker 5:          02:11:59       Yeah, no, he's uh, he's a really, really dedicated guy. You know, Diego Sanchez is a fucking warrior and he's a guy who's one more third rounds of fights where he lost the first two, the Martin Kampmann fight. I'll never forget his face was hanging off of his skull and he's chasing Martin, Kevin and Mark Hammond, who fought a one 85 was a big fucking guy for one 70. And daigo is just, I just run it out of a mask of blood date of the Jake ellenberger fight. The end of the fight. He's on Ellen burgers back. Beaten the shit out of them. That's right. Lost the first two rounds. Comes back in the third like a fucking savage. If every fight was a hundred rounds long, Diego Sanchez might be undefeated Mexican.

Speaker 5:          02:12:41       Fantastic insurance. He always had a crazy car. Do Donald Trump. That's good alone. I mean think about who had more endurance and Julio Cesar Chavez, right? Well yeah, you're right. But then people fail to mention that he trained a, it was in Mexico City or it's 7,000 feet elevation people. If you don't, don't take wine and his fights, a lot of his fights were there as well. Yeah, that's a good point because a lot of people don't realize how high Mexico City is. I didn't know until the first time I went there. I just did a fucking elliptical machine there and I was like, Holy Shit.

Speaker 7:          02:13:13       I said it. I said it to convalesce cause it'll know show are you going to go out like three weeks ahead because of the elevation? And he says, no, we will. Uh, do you think that's a smart idea? Because you should be training there. When I trained for the rental and fight at the Colorado, Colorado did, but my first week days, nine days were

Speaker 6:          02:13:32       really not nice. They were not fun. They, I mean I got tired so fast. It took really a while for me to get into it.

Speaker 5:          02:13:38       And Colorado is 2000 feet below Mexico City, which is correct. A title fight there.

Speaker 6:          02:13:46       Do you remember the second shoot? What's the second shoe of seed there with everybody? When everybody ran out of gas?

Speaker 5:          02:13:50       Yeah, it was the first two U of c's were in Colorado. Oh, the first one to make nichols. And then uh, the uh, uh, the, the other arena downtown. I forgot what she said with Joe and Mark Hunt in Colorado. Yeah. Yes sir. Yeah. Almost died. They both almost died though. There's only one way to prepare for that. So you have to be in that Lma because you literally have less red blood cells. Period. Does that Taco guy who's an endurance athlete who lives in boulder and he told me you have to live there for three years. He said to get to reach the full potential. He's like for free with those guys. For you when you were talking about bikers like or triathletes or something like that, like for them, every last second is in, because you're doing the same activity over and over and over again. It's not like fighting where your creativity, your explosiveness, all these different things come coming in a factor. It's just biking. You're just biking, you're just running. You're just, you're just swimming. These are the things you're doing and so every little second, every little ounce of extra endurance. So the optimize everything in that regard. And he was saying to really hit your full potential, we need to live at altitude and train an altitude for three years. Okay, so lifted trains are nice. Yeah, I see that three years. Wow.

Speaker 6:          02:15:00       Yeah. Well full potential go from the 99% that you had at one year at to said that after three years, you know, it could be like that as well. But I understand what he's spending threshold. If you have like only 10 days or two weeks to train high altitude, I almost would say don't do it because she'll first week it's going to be the worst week. You can't think straight. You know, you, it's, it's better to just stay. But if you have to fight at high altitude, always go there beforehand man. I'm telling you three, four weeks at least.

Speaker 5:          02:15:28       There's the, uh, the first bank center, which is right by my academy that a couple of UFC is there. When you walk out of the dressing room, there's a big metal sign on the wall and it says, uh, extreme elevation. If you, if you feel light headedness or dizzy, please rest to drink water. So that's what like the fighters see as you're walking out to the cage to that biggest fucking science. So it's my fault there. I was like, yeah, yeah. It's crazy for people who don't live there to take fights at altitude. It really is. Yeah. Especially with fights. Fighters can't afford, like if you're training for a fight in Mexico City, you can't afford to go anywhere. I mean if you, if you're on the undercard you making, you know what's like the lowest paid guys in the UFC males is eight eight. It's crazy. It's crazy that I got to, you got to get on the o two trainer, they get those lungs

Speaker 6:          02:16:09       then that will, that will help them a little strengthen him. Yes sir. For sure. Yeah. Because a lot of people say, oh this part of that, you know, it mimics high altitude can't, you cannot. It doesn't do you. Oh you have to wear it like eight hours a day, you know, but otherwise it won't. But it makes your holy spirit towards schist system much stronger and it's easier for you to pull in

Speaker 5:          02:16:24       when you're talking about your own personal o two trainer where you put it in your mouth and you, you have like different on to write

Speaker 2:          02:16:30       stronger. Yup.

Speaker 7:          02:16:31       The stronger with a guy who was a trainer, the scientist behind to Usain Bolt, three out of gold medalists on track. I feel to actually, um, uh, dominick Cruz as well as training there. This guy's a higher Iq and then freaking Einstein hat he has like over 25 medical journals that were very, when it's proven that only inspiratory training works. So what, what, what happened was he, he did and um, uh, uh, review of, of, of my competition and

Speaker 2:          02:17:01       that was not explained what this thing is to people that are listening that don't know

Speaker 7:          02:17:04       it's an, it's a device that I invented because I was, I was an asthma patient and I realized that after an asthma attack for like a weekend better eight days in bed, I would resume my track and field and I would, I would break my running times and it always bought, I, it puzzled me why, why am I stronger after an attack? This is crazy. The medicine medication. And then I realized when I saw, I went to the doctor's office and I saw a poster on the, on the wall, but a pair of lungs on there and it showed where it's inflamed, uh, when you have bronchitis and, and, and what happens is you think as a kid that's effected in the lungs, it's not, it's in the air pipes that go to the lungs. So that was my Aha moment. I realized, Oh, I've been working out in my lungs unknowingly because I'd been pulling air through that infected hole.

Speaker 7:          02:17:46       So unknowingly I made my, my whole lung system, my inspiratory system stronger. So why don't I come up with something that controls the air intake and that was it. And then finally I started though. You got it. I started making it. And it's a very simple device. It starts with a whole of 15 millimeter millimeter. You start training with it and once you feel that you get the same air as you did before, you go to 14 millimeter. And now with this guy, what this guy does with it. Because when my, my lawyer called me and he said, listen, did you read that review about our competition? It's horrible. They, they, they, they slammed this. I say, I know because they control the area in and out. It's not a good way to do it. I said, contact that guy, I want to send them a note to a trainer.

Speaker 7:          02:18:24       And when he contacted him, he said boss would do a he bus route from the o two trainer. Yeah, we already using it. Conspiratory trains. I love the product. So what is the difference? The differences when you control the air out as well, you cannot completely empty your lungs. You'll, you'll do it with resistance. But if you complete an air out is all with force. It's all done by your core and your diaphragm and your intercostal muscles here and your rips. But breathing in, it's also done with that. It's much harder to breathe in. But as soon as I start stopping the airflow out, I cannot completely exhale anymore before I take a new breath. And that's what I started with. So now when we going to come out with all these medical journals, with Usain Bolt, all these people that he trains all do inspiratory muscle training.

Speaker 2:          02:19:05       So they all use that kind of a device all, all use. Wow. So like those masks that you wear, that control in and out, those that, that, that was the cause of competition. That was the competition yet. So it's just something that just controls in and then you can breathe out with your own mouth like so you breathe in through it and then when you breathe out, what do you, how does it work when you breathe out? Freely does that work comes out

Speaker 7:          02:19:27       because it's got two holes, one site as to where they have the holes on a and on the other side you have a flap. And if, if I breathe in, the flap closes. Brilliant. Yeah. And it uh, and then worked. And the only thing that this the scientist said, he said, well you could use it like you did boss with training because a cure me for my asthma on my website you will read a lot of people cure for the asthma. I don't use an inhaler and more and I used an inhaler my entire life. Even before world title fights always had an inhaler with me because if it would be nice, for instance, very aggressively, three times my lungs would close. I have to open them up with an inhaler. I haven't used an inhaler for two and a half, three years now anymore.

Speaker 7:          02:20:06       So it, it works with everything. We were actually looking for an FDA approval. Everything is going to happen now because the results are just crazy. Good. That's fascinating. Yeah. Oh and what he said, what I wanted to say is what he does, he lets them in the morning, do 30 repetitions to, to take a smaller tiny hole and you lean over with the o two trainer and once you, you breathe out, you every bit of air goes out of your lungs and then you, while you're breathing in, you're sitting straight up and then you'll breathe everything out against you. Do so many repetitions in the morning. That's for you, for your insight. So that's all you're doing is just 30 repetitions. That's it. And that will build you up. If you go for six weeks, two times a day, 30 minutes and earth, 30 repetitions. And after that, just one time a day to increase, you're going to have, you could not to have any elected assets in your core, which by the way is the most important thing if fighting.

Speaker 7:          02:20:55       That's why everybody gets tired. I always say because their muscles stopped pumping, you know, just like your, your biceps are pumping and they start pushing your lungs backwards. So now you've launched cannot freely inhale anymore because you're pushing them back, which, which your core. And that's the reason when you see guys, you know, that's why I used to do, I actually set that at an a at the seminar last Saturday. I said that's why would you before a fight, I would do a lot of apps but constant stretching apps, apps, stretches, apps, stretching and I was for that reason because you know, if this gets tight, your core gets tight. Oh, everything goes down hill. That's why the guys in the beginning with, uh, with the steroid a while at the beginning, there's still doing apparently, but you, you saw guys, they, because if you use steroids, you pump much harder, right?

Speaker 7:          02:21:38       So they're very strong until the core build software, elected acid. Now the lung skin breathe in anymore. And that's why you see them going strong, strong, strong, strong, strong. And then suddenly they drop and it's over with them. That's the reason. So your protocol for this o two trainer is you do it 30 times, like 30 breaths, 30 breaths in the morning, 30 in the evening. After six weeks, you increase your Holy Spirit. They say you got 15 to 20% you will gain. It's in. It's incredible. You can do in how, in how long? How much time does it was six weeks sweets. You got to, yeah. You'll be amazed what once we are going to come out with all these journals, you're going to, you're going to like 15 to 20% lung capacity. Yeah. Look, this is in spirit, Tory, right? There's this other devices now they can date. There's still

Speaker 5:          02:22:26       air in there because they can completely empty their logs. We're looking at it for folks who are just listening to this. Yeah. We're looking at a video on a Bas rutten o two trainer, which is online on Youtube. Right. Is it just so that mean or what is the, you're a trader.com. The site crashed right now. Oh, okay. What was the site crashed because we swapped it. We swamped your site boss guy selling some ot trainers. I love the flap though. That's amazing, dude. I'm buying one of these. It's such a, I get you on such an easy score. Yes. That's an easy thing. Now, are you using the buddy exit system that's want I see it. Yeah. No, come on back. Come on back. I'll take you back here. We got to end this podcast anyway, but I'll, I'll show you in the back. I could, cause I gotta get the fuck Outta here, boss. Ruin your fucking gem of a human being. Has a pleasure to know you, an honor to make your acquaintance same. I can say for both of you gentlemen, it was a, an honor to train with you today. Bang Ludwig. You're a fucking genius. And TJ, you're a bad motherfucker and I can't wait to see you fight for the title again. And I really, I really hope it is soon. Yeah. And uh, thank you everybody. That's it. This fucking podcast is over Jihad. Awesome.
