Speaker 1:          00:00:03       Ladies and Gentlemen, Dr Chris Ryan. Hello America. Hello Christopher. We were just talking about, uh, the pussy whipped phenomenon. We're talking about men who have wives that answered their phones, their cell phones. Not to be helpful, like secretarial you. Hey, let me get your phone. So I'm wondering if there are, do to get off on that. Oh yeah, they have a mommy that takes care of him. This guy is kind of like that. He, his wife, uh, I called and it was the first time I'd ever called him before off of this new number and I think she didn't have the number. And so she answered it like accusatory, like hello. He was like, I was doing something wrong. I was selling yourself dirty girl calling her man, fuck is this. And I was just saying, hi, I wished dirty girls called me. You just got to put your number on the Internet.

Speaker 1:          00:00:55       They'll call you okay. Questions I get, I get some dirty emails sometimes. I prefer that. That's good cause that you can control. Yeah. And you don't know if you're being catfished though might be a right as long as they're a nice picture. Give me a fantasy. I'm reading a novel. It's like you're reading the words of a character that someone's created. Do it. Well, you know, I don't care. I'm never going to meet you anyhow. And men would know what men would actually be interested in. Well that's the thing. I mean I had to Bailey Jay on my podcast recently. You know who she is? Yeah, she's coming on mine. Oh good. She's, she's wonderful. I really like her. And she was like, I think she said her husband and straight. Well let's explain who below. Sorry. Yeah. Bailey. Jay's a trans woman. A chick with a dick who doesn't give a shit.

Speaker 1:          00:01:39       What Pronoun you use. She does. She got upset at Gavin McInnes because Gavin was calling her a he did. She really? Yeah cause that's his words though with me. She, cause I asked her about that and she was like, I don't give a shit. She was really relaxed and funny. That's, see Gavin says that, but there could have been some other things because he was being a Dick, you know, very possible. He's the only guy I've ever had in the podcast where two of my friends called me up after the podcast and when that's not true, this guy, this is not what happened. Let me tell you a Kurt Metzger and Jim Norton both called me complaining that what he said wasn't true. So he's a, he's an interesting cat that Gavin, you know, he is [inaudible] name's ringing. It rings a bell, but I, I've got a picture of him but I can't remember who, he was one of the original founders of vice and they call him the godfather of the hipster movement because he dresses like, like a really sharp dressed guy from like the 1940s or something like that. It was like vests and ties and tailored suits and he has this crazy facial hair. Yeah, okay. I've seen that. Yeah. Dresses really nice. And he's super, he's on the right wing side of things, like very conservative and a lot of ways. And he became a Catholic when he was like in his forties. It's a lot of weird shit going on with that. For a woman who, was it one of those? No,

Speaker 2:          00:02:59       he was already married with kids and he, he described it. It was a very weird thing. He said that he was like looking at his daughter's foot and he realized that his, like he's looking at his daughter's heal. He realized that there is a God I'm sure given more time, he would like to express himself a little more clearly in that regard. But um, I have a feeling that a lot of these, a lot of these right wing people that are, um, that go pro religion, the, where it doesn't make sense where they're, they're like super analytical and rational and kind of calculated about other things. But then when it comes to religion, they just completely give in and don't question it. And just, I feel like it's an affiliation thing. I feel like if you want to be affiliated with the right, you have to be religious. And I think that they recognize that and so they support because they know that if you do that, if you blindly affiliate yourself with, with religion and if you want to be like sort of an ingrained in the right, you kind of have to be religious is very few people that are conservative or on the right that are atheists or agnostics. Right.

Speaker 3:          00:04:08       And you're right, there's much more unity on the right and the left, everybody's stabbing each other in the back, which is why assholes rule the world essentially. They stick together and well,

Speaker 2:          00:04:17       it's disturbing to me. And I've got some people coming up, some interesting podcast guests that are going to talk about, and I talked about it with Dave Ruben recently where he calls it and you know, Dave's an interesting example because he is a gay man who is a very, he's across the board on a lot of different issues. He's like, he's, he's pro second amendment. He's, you know, he's like, he's relaxed and analytical and a, he calls it the regressive left. And he's like, it's almost like they'd been fighting against the right so long they've become their own version of that. They have been fighting against like the religious right or the super ultra conservative regressive, right. That they've become the regressive left. And I think he's got some good points in that regard.

Speaker 3:          00:05:01       Yeah. Yeah. I, I, I try to get away from thinking left. Right. You know, because to me it's more tolerant, intolerance [inaudible] and you know, since sex at dawn came out, I, I expected a lot of blowback from the right. And actually most of the blowback we've received has been from the left. Really? Yeah. From, yeah, because all the political correctness, you know, you're a cisgendered white male with your, you know, mansplaining, blah blah blah. You know what mansplaining tell people that don't know though. It's like the, the arrogant guy who explains everything, knows everything, you know. Well, if you explain things and you're a married man, mansplaining, you know what I was thinking about recently and I don't want to get into like a men's rights thing. You know, cause I mean there's, there's a lot to be said there. But anyway, I was thinking about man spreading. You know what that is on the subways and stuff. We

Speaker 1:          00:05:58       sit with your legs open, you take up too much space. Here's the problem with that. Hey, men are generally bigger than women, be men have balls. Where are we supposed to put our balls? If you can't spread what your legs, where do your balls go? Well the idea is that you're being rude though because you're, you should like keep your boss compress the people next to you aren't, you know, they aren't in encroached upon. But yeah, tell you what my balls are getting encroached upon and that's got a very immediate effect. I think that's true. But the meanwhile the seats are what they are. And so for a very short amount of time, just think of it as an exercise in your inner thigh development. Just keep them pinched and work on like an isometric tension sort of a thing. Yeah, I just think about it like putting someone in my guard, like I'm trying to hold a triangle, right.

Speaker 1:          00:06:49       To keep my legs closed. Well look, I'll go with it. If it becomes socially acceptable for me to put my hand down my pants and pulled my balls up before I crossed my legs, you know, I think he's just do that. Well I do do that, but you know, it freaks. Then I shake their hand. You should have like a ball grabbing glove that you could just sort of snap. I'm about to give myself a prostate exams is only so that when I shake your hand, you know? Yeah, yeah. It's, it's, the design sucks. The design of the male body, like the balls in the outside is really stupid. I think it's the design of the fucking seats. I'm fine with my balls. Oh, that vulnerable. Yeah. From A, from a fighter's perspective. Yeah. Too Bad. The most vulnerable part of your body next to your brain and they're, well, you know why they're there.

Speaker 1:          00:07:40       Right. Keep it cool. Keep him cool. Right? So that your boys are ready to roll at a moment's notice. You've always got I insects it done. We say the external scrotum is the equivalent of a beer. Have a fridge in your garage full of beer and he say you got a spare fridge is always ready to go cause you never know when the guys are coming over to watch the game. You got to have a couple of cases cool and ready to go. Right. You can't just pop your nuts out when you think about having sex later on that night and like sperm cool off, but still another shitty design. Like why, why? You know and it's on every animal. Like every mammal has balls in the outside. Well No, not everyone like gorillas there in the abdomen actually. Yeah. Yeah. They have such tiny dicks. Tiny little dicks and see that's why because but the male gorillas twice the size of the female, I didn't know their balls were in their abdomen.

Speaker 1:          00:08:30       Chimps are hanging out, chimps are out, bonobos are out and they're huge giant. They're like chicken eggs. That's because they're, the females are permissive Qa, so you got to the balls outside of the body. That's an indication of female promiscuity and I knew it was the size of the testicles was indicator of female promiscuity. I didn't know the balls outside the body. So ladies, if you don't let God man's plating, how about you stop being horse? If you weren't, we won't man spread. If you weren't holding around, we wouldn't need our ball's in the outside. We could suck our balls up into our abdomen. If you girls just keep your fucking leg shot. How about that? Do you ever see a Yogi do that? Oh No, they do that. Their balls in the air boss if you seen it. No, I don't think it exists.

Speaker 1:          00:09:13       Jamie, find out if a guy can pull. Yeah, I read it too. They used to be a thing about weight. She root karate like wait, she rue guys, supposedly they would have these Katas and in the [inaudible] they would be able to suck their balls up into their body to to prevent them from getting kicked. I've never seen it. I feel like I would have saw it already. A big fan of any ball sucking. Actually none. Well now cause it hurts. Well if a girl does it gentle, she's good at it and she's got like the upward stroke stroking thing while she's sucking on your sac. It's not a bad check. I've never popped a woody on the show before.

Speaker 1:          00:09:48       Some gals have skin, that's all I'm trying to say. The, you know, it's like we're not all created equal. Whether it's basketball or painting or Dick Sucking. Where are the artists? We started this we, you said something about what? Never tried to follow the sun, follow the breadcrumb role. Because I mean for some reason, five minutes ago of the thought I had the thought like I remembered some gay guy saying to me like gay guys give better blowjobs and then women do. Or maybe he was by, oh we were talking about someone sending you a letter catfishing you pretending to be a woman when they're really a man. Oh. And then you said if it's a dude, he knows what gets you off. That reminded me of this thing and I was thinking like, yeah, I'll bet I'll bet dude's give great. Blowjobs I would imagine. Yeah. And Women Lesbians report much higher orgasmic frequency then straight women do. And it's the same thing. Right? Or like a woman knows how to go down on a woman where guys are just like, I don't know what to do.

Speaker 1:          00:10:52       I blow on it. Yeah, it makes sense. But isn't that like a communication thing? Like you tell people what you like and why it feels good. Yeah. Some people just not good at communicating sexually. It's, it's interesting because it's like one of the few things that people can be like really embarrassed about communicating about what it's like people tell you what kind of, what colors they like. You know, I don't like a couch that's white by car has got to be black, you know, like weird rules when it comes to like things that they enjoy. But when it comes to sex, they're really, it's really hard for people to express what they enjoy. Yeah. I dinner last night with a sex therapist and we were talking about that and she's like, she was like, you know, I've got people come in, they've been married 25 years and they've never talked about like what position works, you know, or you know, that she doesn't like it when you do that. You've been doing it 25 years. She gets off on this con punch. Yeah, yeah. It is. It's a weird thing. Sex, you know, it's weird you wanting someone to touch your body in a way that's pleasurable and it really

Speaker 2:          00:11:54       is sort of ultimately based about around reproduction. I mean, that's what the whole feeling and sensitivity is ultimately about naturally

Speaker 3:          00:12:02       the, and was, yeah. I mean we argue in sex at dawn that that in human sexuality got co-opted away from reproduction towards social uses. Yeah, definitely. Without a doubt. Yeah. But originally you, right. I mean, that's why the all the nerve endings are there and you know, all that business.

Speaker 2:          00:12:19       But even that like you could argue that the having it been co opted and having it move away from just being about reproductive, uh, the, the, the pleasure being tied into being a reproductive mechanism. It's still about reproductive even if it's socially, because in the social thing it's one part of, of greater pattern of things that set in place to make sure that you have the preferred mate, you know, like socially as well. Like seeing how someone interacts with someone socially, seeing how someone, all those things are like sort of set up this like very complex dance of interaction between men and women where you're trying to figure out like what is the best case scenario for someone that you're going to get together with that you're going to establish some sort of a really intense relationship and bond with. And the most intense at the, ultimately, at least the, the most, um, the most committed is having a child. You have to take care of together, you know, cause then you're not just committed to it in a sense of I love you and you love me, but now we have to take care of people, you know? And so now we have to sort of abandon our own needs to take care of these people as well. And we've kind of gotten this position by virtue of our being able to socially jive with each other.

Speaker 3:          00:13:40       Yeah. I, I would argue and have argued that in hunter gatherer times, that sort of nuclear family thing that you're positing the, you know, mother, father child is much more fluid. And so women weren't really that concerned about uh, a mate in that sort of long term sense. You're talking about like tribal situations for teachers, which is 95% or more of our existence as a species. Right? So it's, so what I argue in, in sex at dawn is that it's, there's more dispersed responsibility for childcare. That food is shared, that defense is shared, everything shared. And that really freaks out 20th century and 21st century Western scientist because it smacks of communism. You know, but that's simply the fact. If you look at hunter gatherers that still exist or, um, you know, even Banabos, right? One of the primates most closely related to us, they share food, very egalitarian, right? And, uh, so I think that the, the woman, a woman's admiration for a man isn't necessarily attraction

Speaker 4:          00:14:51       for the man. So she might be fucking a dude who's actually genetically more compatible with her. But you know, she spends more time with another guy and you see that played out in marriages now, like a woman Mary, uh, Hugh grant kind of dude, but when she's ovulating showground Fucker, Brad Pitt look into, you know, square jaw testosterone indications, right? Because the, the vigor of his genetics, it turns her on when she's on [inaudible], when she's not ovulating, she finds it kind of vulgar and she's more into the other dude. So like women's taste is really interesting.

Speaker 2:          00:15:29       This woman, uh, tweeted something the other day and I respond to as a really interesting, she's an author and she was saying, uh, that women like men complain that sometimes when men and women are together for a long periods of time that the woman no longer wants to have sex, right? She goes, well, why is it so obvious to men that they want genetic diversity? Right? They want to spread their seed, but when a woman is done with your DNA, like she's already had kids with you, she's going to want Dick from other dudes. Like it makes sense that she would want other DNA. Like why would it be that she would only want kids from one man? And she said she googled it and she couldn't find it anywhere. And I think actually you and I had discussed this once like this idea, but it totally makes sense, right?

Speaker 4:          00:16:16       Yeah, sure. I mean genetic diversity is a big thing. I think I just pulled out my digit. Oh, that earplug. Um, we'll figure it out Jamie. It's just pop right in there. I just moved my foot and something pumped. Oh, it connects over there. Sorry folks. No worries. No, I didn't even know you can hear. I just heard a good, crazy. Yeah. Um, what are we talking about? The, uh, genetic diversity. Yeah. Yeah. Did I ever tell you about the, the goats study, the goat sheep study? And I'm going to great when it's in a, it was took place in Scotland. And do you need a light? Um, they wanted to understand this sort of like how males and females differ in their ad app. Adoptation to, uh, like how they, how they're, how they imprint sexually. So what they did was they took the babies, all the babies born one year from the sheep herd and put them in the goat herd and then they took all the baby goats and put them in the sheep herd. Oh yeah, we did talk. We do it. So in the end, the males were fixed, right? They would only have sex with the one that they had grown up with, but the females were like, whatever, put me with the goats, I'll fuck the goats, the sheep, or if I was here and I don't care. So there's, there's just this fluidity in female sexual response that in males you don't have. And we talked, I think last time I was on, we talked about fetishes and how like almost all fetishists are men.

Speaker 2:          00:17:40       Yeah. I'm going to get that girl on. That's Sierra Cetera.

Speaker 4:          00:17:44       Sierra Lynch. Oh, you're going to have her on. I need to hear about the humiliation and all this crazy shit that she has these guys pay her to do. It just sounds so bizarre. I need to hear about this. But um, you know, like you're talking about the porn star earlier. Not this year is a porn star per se, but she's so sweet and nice and like, sure. You know, she's just really, she's probably just unreal pressed as well, you know? I mean, she's just, her life is so bizarre. And in comparison to the average person that's sometimes I think we have all these like self-imposed borders that we put on our behavior. And I think that's one of the reasons why someone like her exists. Like you're a release valve for all this pressure, this, this repression that a lot of it is self imposed. And so we try to find some sort of an outlet for all their kinky weird shit that that really builds up almost like a residue of our mundane suppress society.

Speaker 4:          00:18:41       Yeah. And it builds up precisely because it's repressed, right? Like that's what this sex therapists last night was saying to me, it's like if, if people have a way to express this energy, then it doesn't become problematic because it doesn't build up. It's, you know, like if dude wants to dress up in women's clothes or whatever, and his wife's cool with it. Like every once in a while he dresses up and I'm like, okay, whatever. That's cool. But if she would freak out, it starts to become a big issue in his life. Last time I was on, I think we talked about, um, I had the, have this theory of how some people have like a homosexuality fetish as opposed to being born homosexual. Did I must have gotten 30 or 40 emails from an after that saying too that to me, I've never heard anyone describe that.

Speaker 4:          00:19:30       That's me. And now I'm getting a lot of, um, gotten several really moving emails from, uh, men who are attracted to kids and what they're saying is like, look, I, you know, I know you, you sympathize with people who can't help what they feel right. Which is true. I feel this, I don't ever want to act on it. I don't want to ever do anything, but I can't tell anyone. I can't go to a therapist because they by law have to like turn me in the culture. So like freaked about anything around, you know, sex and kids that we're shooting ourselves in the foot because we're not giving these guys away to, to let some of that energy vent off. We have to, I think we have to admit that there's something going on in the mind that causes this and they have to figure out what that is. We'll almost always, it's guys who got abused themselves. Did you, these guys say that? Were they saying that? So what is it when you get abused as a child, I could trigger something in you and then that that becomes attached to sexuality. Yeah, I think, I mean, I'm, I haven't done any research, original research. I've read a lot of papers, right? So take it for what it's worth. My

Speaker 3:          00:20:48       feeling is that it's like what we talked about last time with fetishes that you have, there's a developmental period, uh, for boys, somewhere between five and 10 years of age where inexperience can imprint on you permanently. And so that could be expressed as like, you need to smell latex to get off, or you need to, you know, be treated by humiliated by, you know, by somebody like Sierra or, you know, whatever it is. And, or it could be you need to, like, you want to have a sexual experience with a man even though you're not gay because you had that experience when you were seven and that, you know, imprinted on you. Um, and uh, so, and that's what that goat sheep thing is about, right? They wanted to say, they wanted to understand like is this a male mammalian thing? Right. And so that's where they're looking at different species where yeah, these males, even though their goats, they were with sheep when they came of age sexually and for the rest of their lives, they can only fuck shape, you know? Well, what is it with

Speaker 2:          00:21:52       women then if it's a man, a male mammalian thing, because many women when they're young, if they're sexually abused, they associate sex with worth and they become hypersexual at a very early age. They've, they, they, they're more prone to masturbating at an early age.

Speaker 3:          00:22:10       I, I think that's more a psychological with the males I think in, and of course there are many exceptions to what I'm saying, but I think with males it's more just a question of imprint. It's there. You can't change it. So it might be latex, it might be red, high heels, it might be big tits or whatever. And more of a fetish thing, right? A fetish thing. Whereas, and so if you were sexually abused as a kid, the thing is, all right, you're a seven year old boy and your priest Suck Your Dick, right? It's, it's freaky. It's bizarre. But it feels good because those nerve endings are there, no matter how weird the situation is, there's a physiological pleasure associated with it. So, and also, when you're seven, you don't know how weird it is. You don't know what's going on, right? You just know like, wow, that felt great and this guy likes me and I'm special. And so it imprints on a neurological level. Whereas with girls, I think what happens is, you know, Daddy's really nice to me when this happens. Daddy really likes it when I do that, and I love Daddy. And so those sorts of connections are made on the level of personality. God Damn. Yeah, it's, it's heavy. But I to deal with it, we can't, can't push this side isn't real. Right. Yeah. Right,

Speaker 2:          00:23:32       right. Yeah. Yeah. That is the issue, right? Like how do you, how do you mitigate that imprinting when it comes to like how they interface with society? Like how do you, how do you figure out a way that you recognize the fact

Speaker 1:          00:23:46       that they do have this issue and this issue was an imprinting issue because of sexual molestation as a young person and how do, how do you, how do you deal with that and uh, and somehow or another, I mean, I wonder what, if anything could fit. I mean, what, I wonder if they've ever done any studies on psychedelics, like really intense ones, like a boga and things along those lines, like how that reacts to people or how people react to that when they have those kinds of issues. Well, I think that's the way we need to, to look, because I mean, I just finished writing a chapter on psychedelics in this book I'm working on now. And one of the big points is that psychedelics are really good for breaking addiction and addictive behavior, especially a booger. Right? It bill is great because it's so intense.

Speaker 1:          00:24:37       Yeah. But I mean I, Wasc is grades Psilocybin, you know, different, but he, vogue is famous for it. The idea I think is that these boundary disillusioning, these boundary dissolving rather a experiences are so intense that whatever patterns you had that were there before, they've sort of been dissolved for at least at least a short period of time. You know, I, I've, I've, I was described a really intense psychedelic experiences as being like a reset button. Like you're pressing control, alt delete on your brain. And then when your brain reboots, you're left with a blank desktop with one folder in it and that folders labeled mild bullshit. And then in that my old bullshit folder with a think of it, you have to decide like, what do I do? Do I do? I, um, look at this folder and look at it like an outsider and just try to see what is useful, if anything, about my old bullshit or do I fall right back into these comfortable old patterns because those are all I've known for x amount of years of my life until now.

Speaker 1:          00:25:40       I think for a lot of people, they have these big experiences in these big breakthrough moments and then they go, I'm going to be new. I'm going to be different. I'm gonna Change. And then it's too uncomfortable. And then there's too much time between that experience and the next one. And they slowly slide right back into my old bullshit. Yeah. At least, at least partially, you know, at least in some way fall, fall prey to the victim of the patterns of, of, of their past. That's why it's so cool to have ritualized, uh, sort of culturally approved use, like the piety and the habitual Leanne's right where every year they go to the desert and as they're going out to gather the piety every night around the fire, they confess everything they've done that year. That was wrong. So they like cleanse themselves, you know, and then they take the pod and they have that experience, which, you know, I think that sort of sequential ritual helps to seal in the changes, the benefits, you know?

Speaker 1:          00:26:45       Whereas with us like, okay, you go to Peru, you do it, you're back, you're back in your old patterns. Yeah. We've talked about this before. Rites of passage, you know, rites of passage for, for adults that I think that these moments of celebration and ceremony that sometimes they can be like really beneficial because they, they physically mark like a big change in your life. Like it makes this thing, this new thing that becomes a part of your life. It's just my, my phone has decided to transcribe everything I'm saying here. Look at this, see what's going on here. I must've said, Hey Siri. Wow. Because look at this. Yeah. You sure the NSA isn't turning on? Well, what are they going to do? And they can just listen to the podcast and then transcribe and let 'em, hey, Siri has this new thing. Like, like, watch, I'll show you this. This is bizarre. Like, I don't even, excuse me, I'm talking when you're not on microphone, you fuck, you're not Siri. Um, I can say it into it and when I say it into it, we'll call you like, Hey Siri, call Chris Ryan. My number is not going to come up as it. Yeah. Which ones got more than one phone? Oh, there's a bunch of Ryan's. Chris Ryan, you fuck writes Chris Ryan, you fuck, I mean Chris Ryan, the first one. Douchebag.

Speaker 1:          00:28:11       Oh Bam. It is, it listened to me. I said, think about all those words that I said, the first one douche bag. Like get figured out how to do that. So I was on stage in a, uh, the comedy store and I was explaining how crazy phones are now. So I said, I'm going to show you something and time I made this recording and uh, you know, I record all my sets because I'm always working on new material and blah, blah, blah. So anyways, I'm on stage and I said, now, watch this. I go, you know, Hey Siri, call Brian Cowen. And so it starts calling Brian Cowen while I'm onstage, but I made a recording of this, so I'm listening to recording in my car as I'm driving. So my car, my phone is playing in my car. The recording through the Bluetooth and it says in the recording, hey Siri call Brian counts.

Speaker 1:          00:29:02       So while the recording's going on, my fucking phone starts calling Brian Cowen. Like how, but that's an endless loop right? There isn't endless. It's too poor. Brian. And Chuck was getting all these weird phone calls. Yeah, it's a put it on airplane mode so it doesn't work. But how strange that you can just talk to your phone now. Like you need to have to press a button anymore. Well, I got a nice, uh, I mean Google has these new nexus phones. I just ordered one. And the main reason I ordered it is they've also got this, I forget what it's called, f y or something. It's a a plan that they only do with their phones where it's 20 bucks a month, unlimited

Speaker 4:          00:29:42       text and voice and then you pay, I think it's 10 bucks a Gig for um, data, you know, but it automatically picks whatever network is strongest where you are. So it flips from Verizon at and t to sprint, whatever. As you're moving, as soon as you get home, it automatically goes to your Wifi. It always picks Wifi when possible. Whoa. So it's designed to keep your bills as small as possible. And here's why I got it. It's the same all over the world. So I don't have like I've always had a Spanish phone, an American phone. Then I got an unlocked phone with two sim cards and then I have to switch and then the Sim card expires. What? You know, cause I haven't been to Spain for a while and then it's a big fucking pain in the ass. This is like one phone around the world and this is all through Google's all through Google.

Speaker 4:          00:30:26       I guess Google has deals with the various skynet dude there. So terrifying. They're slowly but surely buying up all these android companies, they're buying up robotics companies are, but they're working on artificial intelligence and working on drivable cars. Cars that drive themselves. She, yesterday they invited me to come and speak at their headquarters and where the fuck they going to ask for your DNA? No, it's, you know what they do? So they asked me to come and give a talk and I'm like, fuck yeah, Google. Wow. All right. And then we go back and forth a few times and then there, and then I said, I'd like to bring my wife as well, and she'd love to see the headquarters and then it's like, oh, um, you, we don't have a budget for travel. Um, can you fly yourself to San Francisco?

Speaker 1:          00:31:10       Google, does it have the fuck I'm going to give a talk for free, right. Giving you a day on my life and you want me to pay my flight? Google. You don't even have a flight. Money guys have fucking spaceship money. Exactly. I mean, I want to come under the seats as maybe it was like some Google employee that wasn't, they weren't,

Speaker 4:          00:31:35       you know, they didn't get, well, that's why I said, I mean, I said like, oh, I thought this was an official Google event. Right, and I don't have time. You know, if it's a thing, and he's like, no, this isn't official event. And like, how

Speaker 1:          00:31:47       are you fucking kidding. I don't get it. It's Google. That's so retarded. That's unbelievably retarded. The fact that they would think that that would be okay, that you would just go, yeah, I'll spend money for you. Sure. Fly to this gigantic campus. It's worth billions of dollars as you siphon up all the world's resources and develop the Uber Manch robot. Kim, let me bring you lunch. You know, how about I suck your Dick on there too. I mean, I'm a man. I'm good at it. That's my rose. I know it's done well. You know, that was like the argument for, there's a lot of these festivals like south by southwest and now that we're like, they put on these gigantic festivals and they don't pay the artists, they don't have any money, but it's owned by South West, like south by southwest, like southwest airlines sponsoring the whole thing and they don't even fly you there. I'm like, you can't fly me on your own airline

Speaker 2:          00:32:40       to your thing where you want me to work for free because it's out of your fucking mind. But because it's like a big deal to be there, a lot of people just say, I just want to be a part of this. And they go anywhere.

Speaker 4:          00:32:52       Fair enough. But, and, and I, I'm sure you get these pitches all the time. What's this thing? Summit? Yeah, same deal. Right? You know, it's like up to the mountain or go on the cruise or whatever. But what pisses me off is they don't tell you up front the first four or five exchanges, you're under the impression that this is a paying gig. Right. And then when you've already talked about dates and how great it's going to be and the that it, ah, then it's like, oh, buy and they make you bring up money. You know, you've got an agent who does it, but you know, I was doing it myself and it's like, you know, we've been going back and forth and I have to ask you like, you know, by the way, I, you know, my standard fee is x. Oh no, this is because you get to meet all these great people.

Speaker 2:          00:33:37       You're charging money for tickets. Like, yeah, we'll have to pay to go to this thing. Exactly. And I'm the attraction they're paying so they can meet me. Yeah. So welcome to the future. Well, there's a lot of that going on. I mean, Jamie and I were just discussing that actually before the show started about these companies that are trying to capitalize on podcasts where they're coming along, they're trying to take a piece of the action and offer some non-existence service. It's going to connect to you with more fans and in exchange for a piece of the show. And I'm like, they're just banking on the fact that it seems good because it's a big company. Like there's something attached to being attached to a big company when actually the contrary is true. It's, it's, it's a bad thing to be attached to a big company. Then you have to meet with all these people and they get to decide which direction your shit goes in and like, Ooh. And that's summit thing, man. I got an email and I think, I think you were in it. It was a bunch of faces on the email. Like are you on the website? Are you

Speaker 4:          00:34:39       well fucking hope not cause I, I said no. Well I don't know man. There was a lot of people that were on it that I was looking at that was like, what the fuck? You know, I was looking at it and then I was like, this seems like very strange. Like there's a lot of people involved in this thing. Hold on. Yeah. Well they invited me to go on this cruise, which is next week, I think. And you know it, it is like they've got a lot of heavy hitters going on the cruise, right. As you know, whatever. Not Presenters, but it's like the CEO of Google is going to be there and you know, Mark Zuckerberg or somebody, I all kind of people Hancock's on this thing, right?

Speaker 2:          00:35:16       Hmm. Yeah. Well if they told him he thinks he's getting paid. Yeah. There's a lot of people in this thing. It seemed like they should be getting paid. I mean, this is a, it is, it's a very impressive lineup of human beings.

Speaker 4:          00:35:29       Yeah. Maybe they pay some of them and I'm just like not in the pay grade, you know? I don't know.

Speaker 2:          00:35:35       Well, I don't know either, but

Speaker 1:          00:35:38       I mean, I guess it would kind of make sense if it was free for everybody. Well, if you, or if you're, you're, you're not playing anymore is about like, you need to like, like let's say like Ted, it does this too, right? It's all the networking opportunity. So if you're like a guy with an idea and you need investors than fuck, yeah, that's a great thing to do. But if you're an entertainer, you've got your own audience. Like, I mean, I'm not looking for billionaires to listen to my podcast. That's not really my demographic, you know? Yeah. So there's really nothing in it for me unless the billionaire is interested. But you know, they're an individual at that one point in time that just a person that might happen to be rich, like Richard Branson started listening to your podcast, you wouldn't be bummed out. I'm like, oh, that's cool.

Speaker 1:          00:36:25       He seems like an interesting guy. Like it wouldn't be like, what an awesome opportunity to network and now pitch him my startup, you know? And that's what a lot of these people are doing. Whenever I hear that term, you know, I'm involved in a startup. I just want to run in the opposite direction. Just fucking flee. I didn't even know what you just said. I gotta get the fuck away from you before you hit me with some emails about some shit that I don't give a fuck about. Yeah. Actually. I mean I bad mouth Ted, but I did become very good friends with the billionaire there. There you go. And he's like, I've been on his yacht the bunch of times and it's great. And he network. And here's the cool thing, this guy, I mean, I don't know if he's a billionaire, but he lives on 130 foot yacht.

Speaker 1:          00:37:05       Okay. Which is like, it has a gym. Well that alone is probably worth hundreds of millions of dollars. Uh, I don't know. I'm not appointing yeah. Cars. But this is like a Russian oligarch Kinda, Ya know, helicopter budge him on his yacht is a gym. There's a sauna, there's a Jacuzzi, there's a walk in freezers machines. They're not falling machines. You wouldn't want them rolling around. But anyway, he made his money in wind farms, so there's not even like bad Karma. Oh yeah. He's just, and he's a really nice guy. That's nice. Yeah. Yeah. He's, he's funny. He's raping the wind, stealing all our WIC and love to the wind. All that fucking white man taken all our wind. Yeah. My Kid, uh, we were, uh, driving yesterday. She wanted to watch Peter Pan. We won't see the movie the other day. And the movie is a, it's pretty cool. It's kind of intense, but, uh, this is my youngest, she's five and the movie was a little freaked out for her little too freaky.

Speaker 1:          00:38:07       Like a lot of it was a lot of violence. Even though it's like implied violence, he kind of get it and scared her motto mean people yelling big crocodile. Um, so she wanted to watch the cartoon instead. So I put it on the cartoon and Peter Pan, the cartoon is old as fuck. Right. So I put it on and it is racist as fuck. Like it's one of those cartoons from like whenever, I mean when did they make Peter Pan? You know Jamie's name 19? Yeah, it's a long ass time ago. Um, but it's like they're, they're going to war with the engines in this, they're fighting engines. What it does is say 53. Yeah. There you go. Oh, I'm a little disappointed in them. 53 was a little bit more in line. I was hoping it was like in the thirties. Oh my God. Like, though, you know, the, the what, one of the songs and it was what made the red man read, you know, like it was just like, Ooh, what did your daughter notice that it was racist chest idea.

Speaker 1:          00:39:01       She sees cartoons just go to zoning out while we're driving or her little dance class, you know, she's not thinking about it. It just, she's just looking at something that's more interesting than being on the road. Like I'm not a huge fan of sitting the kids down in front of the TV, but there's a lot of shows that are educational and they actually learned from him. If you could, uh, could put on a good educational program to actually pick up some stuff from it. Some of the little kid shows that they have today to have a little lessons of the kid can learn about, you know, how to be nice and what's the benefit about telling the truth when you made mistakes and not getting upset at people and that kind of stuff. It's kind of cool, but uh, not those old movies, those old movies just, it's just racism the whole after World War II, there was a lot of weird shit like paper in the Pew.

Speaker 1:          00:39:50       I mean, come on like French people staying and it's a random, is it Crieve? Yeah. Fucking cartoon character ever. They never express why they never, they never showed him fucking, and he was, he's clinging and grabbing and hugging and he just wanted to kiss specking stinky rapist and the w who is the other? The, the Dudley do, right? Yeah. That chick was always tied to the railroad tracks was Dudley do. Right. The Canadian, the Melty, he rode his horse backwards. Oh, he wrote it. And the lone ranger and Tonto. You know what [inaudible] means in Spanish? No idiot in Spanish, but native American. What does it mean as if there's one native American language? Well, they have some variations, but they have like similar words. I think that there, I think the people, the writers were fucking with us. I think it was like Sammy Stott, you know the Russian thing where you slip it past the sensors because they don't get it.

Speaker 1:          00:40:48       That makes sense. Like the whole Batman and Robin being a gay couple drink. Come on. That's you know Hawaii wonder the boy wonder. Yeah. He was at the first twink leave it to beaver, but do they call it p for back then beaver. I actually looked this up and I invite you to do it. Jamie, I invite you to prove me wrong. I looked up beaver and it went back to like the 18 hundreds wow. Makes Sense. Cause be for fun. We'll also and grow. They weren't shaving. Yeah. That just shows you what a profound effect porn has had on our culture. Because if you see a Bush today, that's a girl is committed to fucking shaking the, she's going against the grain or she ages. Yeah. Or She's like Lebanese or something like that. She can't help it. She shaved a couple of days ago and she didn't think she was gonna fuck today you get the Vern fucking weeds growing under her panties.

Speaker 1:          00:41:40       It is a weird thing though because like until like, what was it, maybe 15, 20 years ago, everybody had a bush. They just grew up like playboy Bush man. And now there's no Bush and there's no nudes in playboy. What's happening to this world? Fine. Try find a girl today with asshole hair. Right. Try it. Then I just changing the, changing the DNA. It's um, it's a fascinating thing that porn has literally changed the way girls groomed their pubic hair is almost universally like all my, I mean, profound change, like a percentage of change. It's almost like 80, probably like 80 or 90% of women have done like at least some significant grooming down there made. Maybe they leave a little landing strip, but let a full Bush go full Bush was the norm. Right? I don't know. I mean, I would assume. Yeah, I would think so.

Speaker 1:          00:42:36       I mean, dudes weren't grown in right. When I was in high school, I dated this girl. She was crazy. And, um, she was just all over the place and, uh, she was who I was like, it was like, it was two main girlfriends that I had in high school and they're both very nice girls. There's not nothing bad to say about him, but one of them went to Catholic school and she was the most fucked up and she just had just like massive suppression from Catholic school and just looking for an outlet. And her outlet was any boy that like showed her attention like it was, it was good for me early on to like date a girl who's like super promiscuous because of like lowered my expectations about what girls cheating on me or cheating in general. Like we kind of made some sort of agreement somewhere along the line that we'd never be like official boyfriend and girlfriend.

Speaker 1:          00:43:29       We'd never be boring. We just hooked up and fucked a lot. Right. But, um, one time she, uh, had broke up with this guy and, uh, she came over to my house and, uh, we're getting ready to do it, but she wouldn't take her pants off. And I go, why? What's the matter? She goes, I'm embarrassed. I go, why? She goes, oh, my ex boyfriend made me shave my vagina. I went, what? Let's see it. Let's see what's going on down there. I'm like, whoa, that's crazy. Like she was embarrassed that I would see it and like not see her Bush. So it'd be like freaky, like, or that she would be some sort of a pervert or a wack job. But now it's like standard. It's so strange. Like I remember thinking like she was embarrassed because another God, I mean she was 18 she's embarrassed at another guy had made her do this and then I was going to see, and I was going to think about this other guy, but honestly, for whatever reason, I've never been that guy. I'm not like a jealous guy. Like in that way, no. I'm like, who cares? What do I give a fuck? Especially a

Speaker 2:          00:44:32       girl that I wasn't even, it wasn't like, yeah, we were longtime boyfriend and girlfriend or anything. She's just this neighborhood freak that I liked. She was a great person. She's nice. She wasn't bad, but she just describing it friends like she was like, uh, you know how it kitten, you could like roll a ball, yarn in front of them and they just have to dive on it. That's how she was with Dick. He's a role your dick in front of her. Whatever reason, that poor girl, she's everybody. I think pretty much everybody who tried to fuck her fuck her for a while at least. I mean, I'm sure she

Speaker 3:          00:45:07       see, I think a girl like that should be admired and honored, you know? I mean, do you know about the, what were they called? The sacred prostitutes of Ancient Greece sacred? No. Yeah, they, they would, I'm every woman. Uh, I think it was like a month. Every woman at had a month in her life where she would have to go and, um, serve the gods of Greece by being on the steps of the temple. Fucking every man who, you know, wanted to fuck her. Wow. So really? Yeah. So her, her sex like was seen as her service to the gods. And so they weren't whores. They were doing the, were doing God's work right there. You know, that's fascinating. And a lot of cultures have that, like we talked about in, uh, in sex, the time we talked about the Kuleana I think, who like, um, these men would go out on hunting parties like four or five days, you know, if you guys, and a woman would go with them to cook and, you know, keep the camp good when they're out hunting and fuck them when they got back to camp to like keep them comfortable.

Speaker 3:          00:46:15       And she wasn't some horror. She was like a great woman. Like, Hey, it's my turn. You know, and they'd, it was an honored thing to do. And that's, you know, you're talking earlier about like how our culture, you know, we repress all this really natural stuff and make it a problem when like, why it doesn't need to be a problem.

Speaker 2:          00:46:33       I've always wondered why that is. And I wonder if it has anything to do with our, uh, our need for innovation and for growth and for productivity. And if the idea of like somehow in suppressing sexuality it makes people concentrate on being more productive and more successful so that way you can kind of earn sex. And if sex was more free, you wouldn't get as much done. And I wonder if it's some sort of a weird work around that. Almost like the construction of this advanced civilization has sort of a, it's like, it's, it's invented this path that sort of ensures productivity. And one of the best ways to do that is to make people compete like in a very, very, uh, efficient and v ferocious way for the attention of women. And if this attention of women was like easily achieved, there would be less ambition and there would be less than so in, in a sense, suppression like leads to more materialism.

Speaker 2:          00:47:39       And that leads to a more obvious expression of that materialism. Like you want the big house, you want the Nice Watch, you want the nice shoes and the nice clothes and in wanting all those things, uh, you want all those things because sex is like difficult to achieve. And if sex was easy to achieve, you'd be a little bit more relaxed and your needs. Because like ultimately the physical needs kind of like Trump, all the other stuff, you know, I could do, do you want, do you want a nice watch? Yeah. I mean it's okay. Why do I want to, I swatched it will, they kind of look cool. Okay. But do you want a nice watch? Because girls are gonna recognize it. Yeah. Well the girls don't give a shit about a nice watch. They just want to suck your Dick. Wow. Well fuck that. Watch. Exactly.

Speaker 3:          00:48:20       Well you've just summarize the argument of Freud's civilization and its discontents well yeah, that's what he says. He says civilization is the product of a repressed sexual energy being redirected into productive activities. Huh? Well I've sort of reversed it. I've reversed it. Almost like civilization itself. Yeah. Right. Because it, because it's the result of that it wants to continue in amplify that like any system wants to persist. Right. So because it's the result of that, then there are in built in mechanisms for perpetuating that cycle of repression. Redirection. You know, dangling the carrot. I mean, if, if capitalism could stop us from breathing and then charge us for air, they would, oh yeah, they're doing it with water right now. You can figure out how to get

Speaker 2:          00:49:14       that wind farm guy like you're, you, you're using our air. Exactly. You're making money on exactly how that's right.

Speaker 3:          00:49:21       Well, I mean they've done it with land. Right. Anything about it. Like, you know, I'm going to have to pay for land before no one had to pay for shelter. That was free.

Speaker 2:          00:49:28       Well, have you ever heard the argument about public lands? I mean, there's a real issue right now with this Chris Ryan. Fuck, not Chris Ryan, Paul Ryan. Excuse me. You have the Nice, the nice round, which I apologize the Paul Ryan is not in my phone. Um, but that um, in 2013, he had proposed selling off public land to pay for the debt that are corrupt. Politicians have fucking established and Spencer. Right, right. Well, there is Teddy Roosevelt. It's set aside all of these like national parks and all this wildlife area. That's an incredible, because we could all go there. I mean we have these areas of our country that are owned by the citizens. So like you can go to Yellowstone, you can go to all these different national state parks and national and state parks and you can go fishing. You could go fucking kayaking and go camping.

Speaker 2:          00:50:16       And there's politicians that have proposed selling off all this potentially very valuable land to large corporations to pay off a lot of the tax debt or the, um, um, um, deficit debt. The problem with that is, first of all, it's never going to pay it off because we all fucking trillions of dollars. Like they, they, they tried to explain it that of every man, woman and child in this country gave every penny that they owe. We would, they own, we would still be trillions of dollars in debt. Like it doesn't matter because it's debt in dollars and we print dollars. Well, and it's dead to who? Like who do we owe it to? It's all us.

Speaker 2:          00:50:57       What is that? It's a weird fucking, it's just ensuring that we're going to give them a disproportionate amount of resources and and, and Zeros and we already do that. Public land is leased to mining companies for nothing. Yeah, right. Nothing. Nowhere near market value. That's another thing that the right, like almost universally does. They almost universally support big businesses that impede on public lands and frack and do a lot of things that are potentially damaging to the environment and they, they're very submissive of that. The very summit. Oh, what a few p a few, a few wells get tainted, a few, a few lands get poisoned it. There's a few areas where there's a spill. I was invited, but it's this weird sort of agreement. There's an agreement with a lot of like very confirmed right wing people that you're going to be religious. You're going to thank God.

Speaker 2:          00:51:50       You're going to like, whether or not you believe it or not, you're going, you want to align yourself with these people. You have to be openly religious and you also have to be openly dismissive of environmental concerns. There's like this weird thing and oftentimes it's amongst people that are not even wealthy. Not only are they not wealthy, they have no potential to be wealthy. Joe The plumber, fucking soldiers manage this fucking guy do Jujitsu with who a, it seems like a nice guy, but uh, we're having this conversation once about global warming and he starts going off about these people that believe in global warming and that he's just real right wing as a soldier, you know, and he's like, shit, like there's a natural cycle. It's always been like, are you a climate scientist? Like how are you so confident? Do you know? Like there's like thousands of scientists that have been studying this for decades and they're convinced to do some shit going down and that it has a direct relationship.

Speaker 2:          00:52:42       It w whatever percentage of that relationship is, whether it's 5% or 6% or 1% but there is a relationship between modern industrialized civilization and the warming of the planet. Like they believe this is scientists that have looked at the data and say, well, maybe there's some cycle going on, but that cycle may in fact be accentuated by human beings and our activity and we might be speeding this up along and it might have this effect that is like, uh, like this effect where like, like there's, there's some concerned about the polar ice caps. Have you heard that concern? That as they melt, they create pools and as those pools reflect, water exacerbates the situation and everything goes in this exponential

Speaker 1:          00:53:26       rate and it starts instead of looking at it like, oh, we're losing, yeah, there's tipping points instead of loop. We're losing x amount of feet per year. We'll know. We'll actually, once it hits this area and then the comes water and then the water reflects light, then it gets even warmer, then everything gets crazy. Right. And then your, your, you know, then there's gonna come a point in time where you're fucked. I mean, one need not look very far to find underwater civilization evidence in other there, there, there was this, um, there's, there's been a bunch of them that they found recently with a, you know, they'd go like near coastal cities and they're out, you know, scuba dive and then go, what the fuck is this? And they find like, oh, well 5,000 years ago this was the city and now it's under water levels about 300 feet higher than it was 12,000 years ago.

Speaker 1:          00:54:09       Yeah. I mean there's some, I'm sure there's all sorts of reasons for that and I'm sure that's not, that has nothing to do with industrialized civilization because the ice agent, yeah, yeah, exactly. But I mean there's no, there's no question. They understand the mechanism perfectly of what's happening. But I'm with you. I think the, the, I think it's already too late, honestly. And See, that's their next argument. That's the argument that I can't really argue with it because I think they're right that, well, it's too late, you know, because the methane, that's what I'm worried about. You know, about the methane. Yeah. From cow farts. And Shit. No, no. In the bottom of the ocean. O and methane is much, uh, has a much greater impact than CO2, then carbon. And what does that from the bottom of the ocean? What's that? Well, it's human waste.

Speaker 1:          00:54:52       Same thing as the cow shit. It's uh, no, it's um, plant material that sediment, you know, settled to the bottom long time ago. And then because the temperatures very cold, it's frozen so it's sealed in and as the warmer water comes over and melts that ice, like permafrost is also happening in the Arctic, the permafrost is melting, so all the shit that's been sealed under ice is now coming up and it's all decomposing plant materials. So it's full of methane. Well there was a article that I tweeted the other day that's even more terrifying. They were talking about the potential for long frozen viruses and bacteria that we cannot control and that we don't have any immunity. That's interesting. Being released as global warming sort of washes over these fucking dead wooly mammoth carcasses and shit. Some saber tooth tiger got saber tooth tiger aids and it's gonna just get blown off like dandelions in the, in the breeze and it's going to fly up your nose.

Speaker 1:          00:55:52       And I mean, you know, it's completely unsustainable. The population growth. I, there's a cool thing. I've got this unread it. Uh, there's a tangentially speaking page where people talk about the podcast and whatever, friends of mine and stuff. So there's the thing right now about, uh, you where the guy's like, look, Joe Rogan lives the perfect life, right? It's the perfect blend of, of 21st century technology and primordial, uh, you know, life patterns. You know, he kills his own meat. He has chickens, he lives near a city, but he's got land and space, you know, so they sort of delineated all these things, uh, about your life. And he's like, oh, how can everyone live that way? We need to make a world where everyone lives. Like Joe Rogan. Well, I don't think I could ever live like this if a city didn't exist. I don't think our live like, I mean, I'd have to be off the grid, right?

Speaker 1:          00:56:44       So if I'm off the grid and I'm gonna live the way I live, I would have to figure out a way to make a living. So I'd have to have the kind of resources that I have that which are really dependent upon a city and technology and the Internet. Yeah. I mean, it really is impossible. It's not possible for everybody to live the way I'm living. Not if there are 7 billion of us, not if there's 20 million in Los Angeles. Right. Just in this city. I'm a fucking unique parasite. Yeah. Well, what I'm saying is like, if, if I think the key is dramatic reduction of population because we've got the technology right and we understand how reproduction works, so we could stop having babies if we want to. What do you think of the argument that as technology increases and as people become more and more, um, centrally located in cities and a that's happening and all these urban areas and these people will be more concerned with their careers and that I've read that there's a concern that the population will actually decrease dramatically because as people become more concerned with their careers and more ingrained in the civilized urban life, that they'll be less unlikely, less and less likely to breed.

Speaker 1:          00:57:55       Well, it's well documented that as women get more education and enter the workforce, their fertility decreases. It also become more, they have more testosterone, right? I don't know. Yeah. I don't know how familiar with that. But they definitely have less kids for your kids and they weight later in life to start having kids and all that. And they grow Dick's. Right? They become like men and mean. It may be a little, um, but no, that's great. I mean, cause I mean we're not, I'm not talking about, you know, Carly Fiorina, I'm talking about women in Pakistan, right? Who have absolutely no power or anything. So as they get educated and have more access to resources and so on, they'll have fewer kids. And a lot of places in the world right now, population growth is below zero. Japan, Spain, France, you know, the Nordic countries, which is why the whole migration thing is, there's a bit of a, uh, like a, a bait and switch going on there because they're complaining that they don't want immigrants, but they know they need immigrants because there aren't enough young people to support the old people.

Speaker 1:          00:59:03       That's so strange. Yeah. But the problem is that they're getting immigrants in a lot of times these immigrants have like these really extreme cultural values and right. I mean, they have an issue with, you know, different religious factions battling it out and all of these European countries now, it was a giant Muslim population and France and, you know, have you ever seen that video where this guy walks around Paris, dressed as a, a, a Jew, like very obvious Jewish person and he walks through he's Arab neighborhoods and just get fucking yelled at and screamed, oh, it's horrible to the antisemitism. And, uh, I asked, uh, Ari about it and he's like, it's been pretty well documented that a lot of these places that have a allowed, uh, pretty much anyone to immigrate to, that they develop these communities and in these communities, they essentially hold on to some of the worst aspects of wherever they're from.

Speaker 1:          00:59:57       And it's only part of the communities. But if you go through those parts of those communities, you're going to find those people. Yeah, sure. Yeah. It's, it's a tough one. Cause I mean, I'm generally pretty open to immigration. I'm an immigrant and most of the time I'm sure, you know, my grandparents were immigrants. You know, anybody who's not open to immigration in America, it's like, well, where the fuck do you think you came from? You know? I mean, in my case I live in Spain, even native Americans, they came down the Bering strait from Siberia, you know, although that's being questioned. Yeah. They're finding they found a ruins in South America that are about 40,000 years old. Chile. I might, I might be overestimating that, but I think that's what it is. Right? There's no way that was Bering strait. So now they're thinking, well, like I was saying earlier about the diaspora from Africa, it seems it's much more complicated than the story of Bering Strait and then spreading out from there.

Speaker 1:          01:00:51       Cause yeah, they came over in boats. Well that was always an issue with the old mech people. Right. Was it the old Mac? I believe it was that they have these ancient, uh, heads they found in South America our features, they're very African features, very thick lips and wide noses. And they think that it's Mexico. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And they think that it's very possible that this is all Graham Hancock's area of expertise and him and, uh, Randall Carlson will beyond on the 19th. And I'm really psyched about that. That's always a mind bender of a podcast. But Randall Carlson, he's the meteor strike. He fucking freaks me out with evidence photographs and you know, the core samples of how, how radically the earth temperature changed around 12,000 years ago. And he believes that coexist co [inaudible] that it corresponds directly with some sort of an asteroid will impact.

Speaker 1:          01:01:44       But one of his things when he said, everyone's concerned about global warming and he's like, global warming is a real issue. No doubt about it, but you know what? The real issue is global cooling. He goes, global cooling is far more terrifying. If you look at human history, the great periods of growth, the great periods of education and innovation, they all came with warmth. Like whenever there's some cold, whenever things freeze and shutdown, that's a wrap. That's the life killer or killers global cooling. The glaciers in the last ice age, right? The glaciers were down to Minnesota like all of Canada was under and all of northern Europe.

Speaker 4:          01:02:20       Like down into France. Yeah, like to the Pyrenees. Basically half of North America, half of North America was under a mile high sheet of ice. Canada just didn't exist. No fucking hockey. Hockey, no Montreal, no beautiful fringe girls. Nothing. What's that shit with potatoes that they put teens routine. Oh, poutine. That's stuffs for Dick. That's people that are trying to put fat on cold weather food. Really Cozy. That's God damn delicious. I saw, actually I saw you in Vancouver. I was just going to ask you if you've been to Vancouver. I saw your show that that's my favorite city in and well I should say that it's my favorite city all year round. Whereas I really enjoy Toronto when it's warm. It's cold. It's hard. Canada, it's fucking awesome. That is the number one place that I would move outside the United States. Like is Australia and Canada.

Speaker 4:          01:03:14       Those are the two spots that you've heard from Dunkin. He's, he's in Australia now. Is He really? Yeah. He just went down like two days ago. Cause cause that's why I contacted you to do the shrimp parade thing. Right. Cause I was going to be an la that's right. Yeah. We can't seem to organize it when we're all together. But Dunkin's become too successful. Sabotaged his career, hang around with him. Yeah. He used to be available and no love, no duck. And he is so good at podcasts and rants. Yeah. He loves it so much that he almost, I think he loves it more than even loves doing, stand up those rants that he can just freely go into when he does those live podcasts. He's been doing a lot of live podcasting. Well, I did two of them with him, but he never put them out.

Speaker 4:          01:03:58       I don't know where they are. He's holding onto him. Yeah. Yeah, quite a while ago. Really? That seems odd. He doesn't hold on to podcast. That's so strange. Yeah. Dude, I forgot to press record. Fuck. They'll get bad. Let's do it again. I remember when we said we'll just act it out though. Exactly. Australia is amazing though. I fucking love it over there. It's just too far. The flight is just brutal. It's 16 hour flight. I, I've only been there once and it was because I was invited to speak at Sydney Opera House in this thing they do. That's like the Australian ted, but they call it the, the festival of dangerous ideas. Ooh, I like it. Isn't that great? I love it. And it's, it's like the Anti Ted where Ted is all like don't offend anyone and who let us look at what you're going to say and you know, let's rehearse this seven times there.

Speaker 4:          01:04:48       They were like say whatever the fuck you want. We want people to like talk about it and be provoked and like, you know, no limit just to say what you want. I appreciate that. Yeah. I think, I think that's a sign of a healthy culture. Getting back to her saying earlier where we pression causes the problem it's trying to avoid by pressurizing it. Well that's always been the knock on Ted is that they try to control that situation too much. They try to make sure that the speakers all room together, like a Eddie was saying that they made him

Speaker 2:          01:05:18       like room with some other duties like ombre rich. I want to get my own fucking hotel room mantle when they busted his balls because he came up to do your podcast to promote his ted stuff, you know, and they, they, they pulled him off of the rest of the program. It's just you can't do that with a successful guy like him. Cause he's like, what do I give a fuck? Well and getting back to the other shit, they don't pay their perform. Exactly. They didn't pay him and they made him sleep in a room with some other dude. Like it's the whole thing is fucking Uber Bizarre. It's very strange. But in doing that and like really see, I understand what they're doing, they're protecting their brand because it's worth a lot of money now. I mean they have a Ted podcast and they have these ted talks and Tedx and the website gets fucking insane amount of traffic and they've become a corporation.

Speaker 2:          01:06:06       They become this corporate entity. But when you respect someone, like if you have someone like you and they like your book and they like your ideas, the more they can just give you free reign, the more it's going to be exciting. Right? Gonna let you express yourself in an uncensored way. You're going to get the full Chris Ryan experience instead of like some bullshit water down corporate version of whatever the fuck your ideas would be. Whatever palatable aspects of your ideas they think they could sell to people. Yeah, it's a strange, it's strange thing. I mean, I feel like, you know, they've got a huge platform, you've got to respect that. But on the other hand, you know, if I go out and I fuck up, they could just say, well, sorry Chris fucked up. It doesn't have to reflect badly on them. When you saw what happened with Graham Hancock, when the Graham Hancock put out his thing and they were saying this, all this pseudo science, they're accusing of of pseudoscience and, and, and you know, this, this horrific idea of pseudoscience, like let the guy express his opinions and ideas.

Speaker 2:          01:07:04       And it was, it was about psychedelic drugs and it's his thoughts on how it corresponds with creativity and history and what, you know, how man sort of evolved and emerged with psychedelic trucks. It's not a unique opinion. Not saying that it's not original, it's not unique in that it's not cool and interesting and that it's not, he's not the only one that thinks this. Sure. There's many, many people that believe this, and this is a common thought, not just amongst people that are on the fringe, but amongst scholars. Yeah. There's a lot of people that correlate and rightly so, incredibly powerful hallucinogenic experiences with changing people's ideas and minds. And that corresponds to a big leaps of creativity are big chances that people take. Or like we were talking about your friend, uh, earlier today that was a lawyer and you know, it goes on this fucking psychedelic trip and says, fuck this law shit. I'm going to open up a float tank center and I'm going to be a freak and happy. Yeah, exactly. And you know, there's a big thing now in silicon valley with microdosing microdosing wa which Lsd or suicide or whatever it is. Um, because

Speaker 4:          01:08:16       of the creativity. Yeah. So like Steve Jobs said LSD was the most important experience of his life. Uh, Kary Mullis who invented the DNA replication, a credited to, uh, get the PR, what is it? Pr? Probably Mary's chain something TCR or something like that. Yeah. He's supposed to be crazy though. He's an interesting dude. Yeah. He took his, his Nobel money and just surfs. Really? Yeah, I met him at, at Ted actually. Yeah, he's a, yeah, he was, it was kind of irritating because I wanted to shake his hand and say hello and, but every time I saw him he was engaged in the same argument with the same guy. This one guy was just hounding him and I don't remember, I don't know if it was like chem trails or it was like one of these things and I kept thinking like, dude, just like, you know, it's been two days.

Speaker 4:          01:09:13       Yeah. Yeah. What's more of this? And I'm good. So, um, yeah, the, the surfing thing is another one of those things like golf that I'm scared to try and I don't necessarily think I would get addicted to golf because I find it's the, what's ridiculous about it is more appealing to mock than it is a interesting to walk, like the precision and the accuracy and all the, you know, the, the control that you have to have over your movement, your body to make that ball roll into the hole. It's still the end of the day, it's just a ball falling into a hole. It's fucking stupid. And that said, I'm hypocritical because I play pool and I love that. But I know I become addicted to that. But the surfing thing is an addictive it addictive thing that I'm scared of because I think I would fucking dive right into that shit.

Speaker 4:          01:09:57       Everybody that I talked to that surfs the way they describe it, I feel like it would be amazing. But that's a really healthy thing to be doing until the sharks come and bite your Dick off, Chris Ryan, you just punch it in the face. You're a trained fighter, man. Maybe I need to figure out how to get strong enough where I can surf with chain mail, like a shark proof suit and just to get to be really yolked. I tried surfing in Nicaragua. I look how you said that when he got out, go check out our, like you fit right in. And I gave love. Yeah, it was perfect. Uh, the perfect wave, perfect place. And there was this ex military American dude who gave lessons. And like I'm at, I'm in a cafe or something and he's like, dude, I'll take you out. It's great.

Speaker 4:          01:10:38       It's where they filmed one of the like survivor or one of those shows. And um, yeah, he took me out and it was this, it was like the perfect baby wave. It was maybe like two or three feet high, perfect line coming in at just the right angle. Like he couldn't fuck it up, you know? And I just real long board, which is really easy. Longboards are better. Yeah, well they're stable. Right. And uh, I mean, I'm such a fucking pussy man. I like after like doing the push up and get up on it, you know, like 20 times I like my arms were shaking and like my knees were shaking,

Speaker 1:          01:11:14       you know, I'm not in great physical condition. And finally I got up and I was like, oh, I'm standing and the waves moving me a little bit and then I fell forward and the board smacked me right in the fucking forehead. And I literally saw stars, you know, like I haven't since I was seven and I wrecked my bike, you know, like that kind of like whoa. And I'm underwater and like, all right, that's, you could die. Yeah. Yeah. You can hit your head and died doing that shit. Oh, do you see this? What's going on there? I uh, I was with this buddy of mine at a firing range. Oh, two weeks ago. Yourself. I had blood running down my face. It was, it was humiliating. I've done a really, yeah, I myself, once I scold myself once when I shot a pig that was just scope myself right on the nose.

Speaker 1:          01:12:06       Oh, I cannot an actual hunting situation. I'll walk myself as better or worse. I mean, there were a lot of like, okay, wait a minute. White men laughing at me. Here's why it's worse. I didn't, I scoped. It's siting in my rifle now that I reconsider. I had a bandaid on when I shot the pig, but I scoped myself shooting at a target before shot the pig. Now that, well that's what I, my buddy was scoping in like he had a new, he's an elk on her and he had a new wind mag 300 right? Yeah. So I was shooting is 30 odd six and apparently I was doing pretty well and I don't, maybe he was just humoring me, but he was like, Hey, I think this is firing a little high. Can you take a shot cause you're, you're really steady today. And so I was like, okay, no problem.

Speaker 1:          01:12:48       And just like it just drove right into my forehead. If you get used to have 30 odd six is a big difference between the kick of the 300 win Mag. That's a big shell. I got one of those. Is that what your monster thing is that you took out the two rifles that are like that around that one of them's a 300 win mag. The other one's a seven millimeter Remington ultra mag, which is basically real similar in size and round. They're both big heavy rounds. I shot the Moose with that fucker right there. Where? That's right here. It's a baby moose. That's a Moose Moose. They would call it like a Forkey was 900 pounds and it was a small one. There's so big. Where were you? Canada? My buddy shot one the same trip that was probably six 700 pounds bigger. It was so big.

Speaker 1:          01:13:39       He walked across it, walked across the road and it literally didn't look real like his walked in the street in front of us, like it was road the street, but it was maybe 250 yards in front of us in the road cheeses, it was like Jurassic Park. It was like a scene in Jurassic Park. I mean we could have probably driven under it with a truck we were in. I'm not kidding. There's so fucking big. I remember seeing them in Alaska and thinking they were like horses on steroids. Yeah, they're just a shoulder front, shoulders. Incredible. With barn doors growing out of the side of their heads. They're monstrous, monstrous animals. You know, there's an idea that's connected with the cold weather and large mammals like that, that the colder the weather, the larger the Mammo, I forget what the principle is. It's skin exposure. Yeah, bigger internal and less skin exposure.

Speaker 1:          01:14:31       The ratio, the ratio, because the same animals that are enormous in like Saskatchewan, like white tailed deer. If they're in Mexico, they're way smaller, like a big white tail deer. In Mexico it was only like a hundred and something pounds. Whereas in Saskatchewan they'll get to 300 plus pounds. They're literally like three times as big. Same species. Yeah. Same species. Yeah. That's what also why polar bears are so fucking big that polar bears are gigantic. You know, Kodiak bears on, um, we've been to Kodiak, man, I've seen one day I was sitting on a bridge. It was weird. I was sitting on this bridge. I'd gone for a walk and it's like a low, you know, dirt board kind of bridge, you know, and I sit in their writing in my journal, the pedantic dickhead. I was like, you know, poetry about Alaska or something. And I heard the splashing in the river below and I turned to look and I'm like, maybe 15 feet above the water and I look below and there's this fucking bear down. They're like knocking salmon around, like on the documentaries. Oh my God. I immediately, I had like this, you know, bugs bunny image of him chasing me and me running down and then, you know, whatever.

Speaker 1:          01:15:42       He didn't even notice me or, or it didn't give a shit. Yeah. Apparently on Kodiak island, even though they're so enormous, those bears are so terrifying. There's very few negative interactions with human beings and that's one of the reasons why some people thought that that show the hunt, I don't know if you saw it, it was a show that was on, I think it was on discovery or one of those networks. What history? Just recently. Yeah, it was Jonny Hughes did that. Who's Johnny? He's, he's a guy. He's a writer. I know at, in fact, maybe I told this story on your podcast about when he was in new new New Guinea and he brought those people back, the natives back to London. Does that ring a bell? Anyway, I'm interrupting. You rang a bell going with, you're trying to remember what it was. It was a hosted by or narrated by the lead singer of Metallica.

Speaker 1:          01:16:30       James Hatfield and it was about taking grizzly hunters to this one island in Alaska that has the largest brown bears in the world. They're fucking in Norris, Kodiak, Kodiak island. And but the thing is they're just eating fish. Yeah. Fish and beached whales. That's another thing they eat. They beached whale can a whale dies and washed up on the beach. They'll eat that fucking whale for weeks and weeks. They're disgusting. I looked at leat that rotten stinky whale like yeah cause it's easier to digest French. Yeah. They just get like cheese and like they, that's why you can play dead with grizzlies but not black really

Speaker 4:          01:17:10       can't play dead with black parents. Well what I've, you know, look it up until he just start going to be careful with bullshit I come up with here. Yeah. What I've been told is that black bears just eat you fresh grizzly bears. We'll throw some dirt over here and come back a week later because they like it rotten. That makes sense. Unless they're super hungry at the time and they just gorge your guts and then slowly, that's one of the things they do is they always eat the guts first. And women, you know about the thing with women with the pussy, if they're having a period. Yeah, it's really terrible. Way To die first for the bear. Have you seen the movie a grizzly man? I love that. That's a great movie. That was one of my favorite unintentional comedies ever. I swear to God. I think Werner Herzog, I would love to get drunk with that guy and ask him, come on man.

Speaker 4:          01:17:56       You knew you were being funny movie. No, I have not. I would love to though. He's amazing. He knows he's funny. I had that question about him and I watched a bad lieutenant. Did you, have you seen this? No. He made a remake of it with Nicholas Cage, uh, three, four years ago. Got To watch her. Why would they do that? It's fantastic. It's fantastic. Nicholas Cage is off the fucking rock. He's crazed in it. It's really hard for me. It's better. I'm a big Verner hurt, shock Jesus. In your life. I love Verna Hertz, man. Did you ever see him as a bad guy and that shitty Tom Hanks movie or not Tom Hanks, Tom Cruise movie. It was a Shitty Tom Cruise movie where Tom Reach Jack reacher or something like that. I never saw that. Oh, I was at pizza shit. We did a Tom cruise is like some assassin or something like that.

Speaker 4:          01:18:51       Nobody can kill him. He kills everybody and Werner Herzog is one of the bad guys. Winds up killing Werner Herzog is such a fucking clunky, stupid fucking movie, but he has a nice car. It drives a nice 1970 Chevelle. Beautiful car. There is that. But Werner Herzog is an actor in a rare moment, but when he talks, all you can think of, he's teammate Treadwell. Timothy Treadwell in the grizzly made pretty good. Yeah. [inaudible] of nature. If you seen the Antarctic did, no, what does that, that's a great movie and counters at the end of the world. It's called. Oh, so Verna hertz talk, he's like, he says at the beginning like, um, you know, some organization gave him $5 million to make a movie about Antarctica. And he said, and I, I said to them, I will not make another movie about the damn penguins.

Speaker 4:          01:19:44       So the deal was like, here's 5 billion or whatever it was, just go do what you do. Right. So he goes down there and he, uh, first he's got this friend Henry Kaiser, I think his name is, used to be the Henry Kaiser Band set ring a bell. It's like in the late seventies, early eighties, like a prog rock kind of band. He quit music and became an underwater photographer and now he's like the best at, uh, under ice. Oh God. Yeah. Imagining that, uh, you've had vim Hoff on here. I'm going to go to Amsterdam and cause he's, I talked to his son and actually I was texting with his son while you guys were talking. Oh Wow. And uh, uh, his son was like, yeah, we'll do it. And I was like, but I don't want to do a fucking Skype thing. I want to meet with him. He's like, I think he's an amazing human being.

Speaker 4:          01:20:34       So I go to Amsterdam a lot, so sometime I'm going to go like, hang on. His houseboat attitude radiates. Really? Yeah, yeah, yeah. When he's sitting across, he's got this fucking magnetic energy. He's like, just a real deal. Oh yeah, yeah. 26 world records. I'd say when you get over 20 world records, you're the real deal. Well, and it's like my buddy who's rich from wind farms, it's like when, I mean, I don't know when, but what I've seen him on your show and I've seen the vice thing and it's not about, look how cool I am. It's not ego like, oh, I gotta get another record and prove, you know, whatever. The dude's connected to something really deep. And the whole thing with his wife and you know, how it started is so like beautiful and touching and sincere. Yeah. You know, it's not an ego.

Speaker 4:          01:21:21       Like I saw that film a Everest the other day. Have you seen that? It's based on the Krakauer book and it's been there a drama. Right? It's a drama. Right. Well, but it's based on truth. The true story of, of this, uh, I don't know if it's 10 years ago, there was a day when like 10 people died. It was the most disastrous day on Everest ever and all this shit. But I was watching that and it's like, okay, you guys are all climbing Mount Everest. Why? Who gives a fuck? It's all ego, ego. Like it looks really cool from the valley, you know? I mean it really does. You don't need to like what is it about you that you need to say? I was at the top of Everest, you know, with my oxygen tanks and the five Sherpas carrying all my shit, you know, and I paid 60 grand to the guide to like drag my sorry ass up there.

Speaker 4:          01:22:12       I just felt like, Eh, fuck that. But then when you know, Eh, that's a whole different thing. It's not about ego. Well he also did it in his fucking shorts with no shirt and he said he was like, to do it with clothes is too easy. Like that's one of the things he said it would really be easy. There was a recent article, I forget what publication, but when some online thing where they were talking about the business of going to Everest, that it's like this eco tourists business now where you get all these rich people and the higher the Sherpas that do all the dirty work, all the hard stuff carrying the oxygen, carrying the food, carrying everything. And all these people do is they sit in their warm tents and they put on their warm clothes and then they go where the Sherpas tell them and they feel like heroes. Yeah, but I used to do a whole bit about Mount Everest, that it's not like when you get to the top of lucky charms guys waiting for you with a bag of gold. Ah, finally have reached the top. Now you don't have work again for the rest

Speaker 1:          01:23:05       your life. Come with me. There's free pussy and cocoa and attend. Below is this bit about like the idea of climbing to the top spot is like impressive, but nobody gives a fuck if you got to the lowest spot. Like nobody, like I get to the lowest spot on earth, bro. Like, what's it like? You go down and then you go straight. You get to the bottom. There's nowhere. You can't go any further. You're so brave. Like no one cares about the lowest spot, but everybody cares. Mariana's trench a little while that's dead. It was pretty good in the ocean. Yeah. When you go in the ocean, that's anytime work death valley or something. Yeah. That's just like there's some stupid chimp thing about going to the top branch is because like we associate the highest branches with being safe from the predators. Like that's the reason why bedrooms have like if you have a house.

Speaker 1:          01:23:53       Yeah, the master bedroom is almost always on the top floor. And the reason is it's like you want to be above to like look down at the potential predators. Like there's an association people believe with chimps and trees and human beings and having like houses that are on the top war, the master bedroom's on the top. That up. Jamie, that sounds like bullshit to me. It does sound like bullshit. Again, this is something I read. I'm thinking, uh, the bedrooms being on top comes from the centuries where people lived above their domesticated animals and the heat from the animals rose up and heated their bedroom. What farts? Animal Farm. Animal Heat. Body Heat. Really? Yeah. Boy, that's an interesting theory. But like Tibet, people live above their, their ox. Yeah, that's what I'm sure saying. I would think it would be more of a security thing though. I'd like to live in a cave.

Speaker 1:          01:24:44       If you're above, like people have to get to you and it's way better strategically to be a time you have a view. It's always nice to have a view. That's nice. You like to live in a cave. This is a k for say on Bisbee, Arizona were ducks. Dan Hopeless. Maybe you don't buy it. I had a house built into a cave to go to a busy bee and check that out. I want to go before Doug dies. I don't know how much longer he's got left. He's hoping he's going to hang in there for a long time. But you're right. I mean, I know he's a bit of a wild man. Probably live forever. He'll do a Keith Richards pissing on Migraine, but he, uh, he has hernia. It's like he can lie on his back and flex the stomach and like is bulges like his bulges in his stomach where they pop out in several places. Like his internal organs are like trying to escape from his body cavity. It's got to get that shit sewn up. No, he won't do it. It's not going to happen. We'll take care of that shit with Budweiser and cigarettes.

Speaker 1:          01:25:36       A little duct tape mocks me, mocks me, and he goes, how many surgeries have you had? Rogan and Lincoln had a fuck load. None. That's like his bear. A barometer for like, who's healthier? Who's living a healthier life? I've been fucking stitch back together again. Six or seven times. None. I resonate with that sometimes. You know, I see somebody getting hurt some and I'm like, yeah, didn't happen to me. Look at me. I'm sitting here saying, buy a surfboard. It didn't. And then a gun. What did you like? Laird Hamilton, the out there every day looking sleek. Call six Paki and shit flexing as your fucking ride. The wave. I don't know what it would do for me though. Well you read that thing that I wrote for Esquire. I do the, um, the idea of you're, you're the human body's ultimately a lot like a sand castle and that, yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:26:30       And that's really at the end of the day, I mean enjoy it while you've got it, but at the end of the day, it's pretty much pointless. I mean, we really are, you know, Kubler Ross's five stages of grief, right? The, you know what I'm talking about? I've heard that expression, but I don't know what they are. It's good to memorize cause you see them everywhere that the acronym is Dab de da De da. So it's denial. So this is whether you're like losing your job, your marriage, you, someone close to you dying or you just got like the pancreatic cancer diagnosis, right? It's all the same. And you and some people skip stages and never get to the lower ones, whatever. But the sequence is denial, anger, so denial like, oh no, there's a mistake. This can't be right. Right. Then there's anger. Like why me? That's not fair. I don't smoke. And uh, and then there's bargaining.

Speaker 1:          01:27:20       Okay, I look from now on, I'm going to work out right from now on, I'm going to eat right, I'm going to, and then there's a depression and then there's acceptance. Acceptance is if you're lucky enough and evolved enough and psychedelics I think really help get to the acceptance stage. That's why they're so a psilocybin, so effective with end of life, uh, treatment for anxiety. People are facing the end. They take a silicide been dose and have an experience in there. Like, Oh, I'm not afraid of dying anymore. It's supposed to be one of the most amazing things for people on that. Yeah. It helps them accept this idea. I remember Larry Hagman was talking about that in this interview that he did on CNN of all places. And uh, they were interviewing him about, you know, like, like times in his life and you know, what, what, what like impactful moments.

Speaker 1:          01:28:09       And he said, well, the last time I took Lsd, and you could tell like the person who was interviewing him, who was interviewing him, it didn't expect that. And he said, bullied it alleviated my fear of dying. I really, I no longer worry about death, you know? And he said the experience, whatever he had when he was on Lsd was so profound that it's sort of like relaxed into, and he had that air about him too. Like, like a guy who was just there. He's there, he's not like putting on a show. He's not like faking it and he's not, he's just there. He's, he's him, you know. And he lived at like a fairly sustainable life for a wealthy famous guy. Had He, I think, I believe his house was completely off the grid. I had some house in the Santa Monica Mountains. Yeah, I remember reading something about that.

Speaker 1:          01:28:57       And I wonder if his house was still available. I'd look to fucking by Larry Hagman's house. Pretty Dope. Better than a cave? Probably, yes. Maybe not though. Cave would probably like be really efficient as far as like keeping you cool temperature, same all year round. You know, it's, you can have like grass growing on the roof. That's pretty dirty. Fucking hobbit house. Remember they had those big brown doors, the side of the Shyer, well you know this thing about fear of death, you were talking earlier about um, making sex, like restricting access and then using it as a lure to get people to work, right? Yeah. So in, in civilized to death, the last chapter that have just written, by the way, I'm fucking done while I'm in the rewrites now. But like, yeah, you hit the end of the book. So now it's just about editing and rewrites and, but you know how they say like work expands to fill the space allotted to it.

Speaker 1:          01:29:47       Well, I've been in the U S for like four years off and on. Right. And like I finally decided like, no, we're going back to Spain end of December. So the book gets done in November. Of course, of course, because you had a deadline. A lot of people say that with a lot of things they do, like they like deadlines because deadlines or force you to fucking just cram that work in and, and it eliminates any possibility of excuses. If you have a deadline, I just blow by deadlines. Do you? Yeah, it's gotta be structural in my life. If it's someone telling me, Chris, it's gotta be done by Tuesday. I'm like, yeah, whatever. That's negotiable, but I feel like I'm moving to Spain and December. All right, and then you finish it in time because I got no kids. I got no mortgage. I mean, I do, but it's nothing and it's like, well, I don't really, yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:30:34       I had this conversation with a friend of mine and obviously, you know, I have kids and I love having kids. I love my family. I'm very, very, very happy. Couldn't, wouldn't want it any other way, but I have this conversation with my friend who also has a family. It also has kids, and we were talking about this guy we know, I want to say his name. He's a successful guy, he's wealthy, he's doing really well. He's a well loved guy, but he doesn't have any children, and he goes, fucking sad. I go, why is he sad? And he goes, she doesn't have any kids sad. He goes, what's it all for? I go, what's yours off for? I go, you're going to have, you're going to give it to your kids and they're going to die too. Fuck difference. Does it make I go, I don't, I used to resent that when I didn't have children.

Speaker 1:          01:31:15       I always resented this idea that a meaningful life only involves reproduction. I resent it today and I love my kids. I resent it. I think that's nonsense. I think you could have a beautiful, meaningful life and never reproduce. You don't need to reproduce. How do you affect the people around you? How do you feel? My family, it's not just my family of the children I've made and my wife, my family is my friends. The people I love. Those are my family. You know, like a family, like put it, put whatever word you know, call it whatever noise you want to make with your face. But what's important to me is who you love and who you take in and who you surround yourself with. I have this group of amazing, beautiful people I share time

Speaker 2:          01:32:00       with and whether they were born out of my wife's pussy or whether they were born out of someone else's pussy, who cares like that. This idea that it's only meaningful if you surround yourself with people that came out of, you know, your own Dna I think is it's so, it's not just shortsighted, it's dangerously egotistical. I think it's just, it's bad for you. It's bad for everybody.

Speaker 3:          01:32:24       I think it's, it's an avoidance of death. Yeah. And that's what I was gonna say, like you were talking about sex. What I argue in the end of this book is that there's also a mechanism built the same sort of mechanism built around death. That we're terrified. We're the, we're the only animal that knows it dies, right? Homo Sapiens, sapiens, the homeowner who knows it knows what do we know? We know we're going to die. So what did we do then? We develop all these mechanisms, some conscious, some not for avoiding thinking about that. And I think civilization is one of them. We align ourselves with something bigger than ourselves. So, you know, and there's all this really interesting research on terror management theory. It's called, where they look at the subconscious mechanisms. Uh, when people are reminded of mortality, they react differently to people outside their group.

Speaker 3:          01:33:15       They're much more aggressive and much more aligned with the, you know, the identity of their group and all that. Um, but so that, that's what I'm arguing. And I think the reason, think about psychedelics, right? And you've heard this a million times. Every culture that's had access to them, he's seen them as the greatest gifts of the gods, the greatest, most sacred things that we have in America. You get busted with a bag of mushrooms at a concert. You go to prison longer than if you kill somebody. Think about that. What does that mean? What the fuck are we? So afraid you have

Speaker 2:          01:33:50       a Duffel bag filled with mushrooms and you're selling them at a concert. It is literally possible that you will have a larger prison sentence. And if you accidentally kill someone in a street fight, minimum mandatory sentencing, right? Second degree murder versus distribution schedule one psychedelics. Yeah. I know a guy who's doing anything here a year for manslaughter a year, he's doing a year. He shot someone in a road rage incident a year, a year. And if he had mushrooms in his car, it'd be 10 years. Yeah. It's very possible if you're in the wrong place, the wrong part of the country, the wrong judge. And what do mushrooms do? They give you peace or they freak out depending on how, how, how hard you're holding on to it. You hold it on those bad trips. I've never had a bad trip on mushrooms, but I understand where they come from.

Speaker 2:          01:34:36       I've had bad trips on weed. I've had those woo over eating to a tree. That's especially early in my career as a, a, a psycho, not a, yeah, I had some fucking, because like we're were talking about before they make sprays now ladies and gentlemen, I just want to be honest. Uh, I'm not entirely sober right now, uh, for the show or a little spray under my tongue and um, they make stuff that's too fucking strong. Like Joey Diaz, who's the savage of all savages. What he does is he'll take a 500 milligram THC candy, which um, you know what I like? I like 20. I like the 20 twenty's a good dose. Like before I go on stage, I like our 20. It's not strong, it's light. It's a little fun with happy. He'll take off fucking 500 and then he takes a rapper for a cheaper lower dose and he puts the 500 in the lower dose rapper and he gives them to people.

Speaker 4:          01:35:39       Uh, see that's not cool to him at school. He loves it. He loves dosing people. I'm very against that. I mean I spent a lot of time around psychedelics and that's the one thing that I could never forgive. If you ever heard a Dunkin story about Joey, Joey gave Dunkin some fucking cookie of death and it was just unbelievably powerful. And he told Dunkin, look, you know, just see it. Just, you know, how strong is it? It's not that bad. Just eat it. So Dunkin eats it. An hour later he is at his home in a fucking tornado of terror, just spiraling, freaking out. And then he gets a phone call and it's Joey Diaz. He goes, welcome to my world.

Speaker 4:          01:36:28       I guess. I guess if it's coming from Joey Diaz, you should know better. That's the guy though. I mean that's just Joey's, that's what you get when you do it with Joey. I'd love that guy. I'm so, I'm so happy. I know him. So happy he exists. I've had one bad, bad. I mean, I've had crazy shit happen. You know, like I probably have told you the story about when I got stung by a Scorpion when I was tripping. Oh yeah. So I mean I've had, and I thought I was going to die. Right. But that ended up being a really good experience. But the last time I did acid, I did a heroic dose. Don't, don't, don't, don't. Yeah. And it ended, I won't go through the whole story, but it ended with me wandering onto the grounds of a psychiatric hospital and hiding the metal filings.

Speaker 4:          01:37:14       And I heard all these weird voices and I hid under this Rhododendron Bush. And it turns out that they were the patients taking a walk and they were like wandering the grounds and I'm like, cowering under this Rhododendron Bush. Like having cried and lost my shirt and you know, I was just a fucking tired and my face. Thank God I can lock you up. Yeah. It's crazy. Bastard. Or I'm a doctor. My name is Chris Ryan. I want to wrote a book about sex. No, not that Chris Ryan, the other groups. Ryan Nolan. Ryan the picture. Oh my God. You know about that research where they, uh, I think it was at Yale, um, in

Speaker 1:          01:37:56       a psychiatry residents. The teacher said, okay, the project is this weekend, you have to go out. There were like six or seven students had to go out and check themselves into a psychiatric hospital. Ooh. Um, separate different ones. Right. Saying that they were hearing voices that we're telling them to hurt themselves, check in and then spend the night and then the next day explaining the situation and come back. And none of them could get out because they wouldn't believe cause they're like, no, listen, I'm a medical student. I go to Yale, my professor, this was a project? No, not one of them could get out. Wow. So how did they get them out? Because the professor went, oh, because the professor knew that was going to happen. Right. Wow. Cause he's like he, it was to show like how helpless psychiatric patients are. Cause even when they're telling you the truth, you don't believe him.

Speaker 1:          01:38:48       Well he's not always the case. Like when everyone's being accused of anything, you feel guilty even if you're not like I've been pulled over before and been stone cold sober. And especially before I was famous and worried that I'm not sober, that I did something wrong with the cops. Like what did I do? What did I do? You start going through your Rolodex of Shit that you might've done but he didn't do anything. And that's where ended to false confessions a lot of times. Well listen, if you put enough pressure on people, especially if you lock them up and like this is what the fuck is going on with Guantanamo Bay, they just released this guy that just was in there for 14 years and have a story about it and then being beaten and he was fucking innocent. He didn't do anything. They had no charges. There was no, there's no, no reason to detain him to suspicion and suspicion is a very weird thing cause if I suspect you, what do you plot and Chris Ryan, you come on my podcast, but I think you've got to fucking and alternative intention.

Speaker 1:          01:39:43       There's something going on behind your eyes. I see it out. I figure, oh you're here for my fucking free coffee. You know like when people start like accusing you of things, you start wondering about your own intentions. You start like we exist in some sort of a strange state where we're constantly in seeking approval. We seek approval from each other and we, we like to live in at least some somewhat of a state of harmony with our neighbors and our friends and our community. And when someone is pointing to you at being a disruptor of harmony in some way, shape, or form, you know, like if you're in a relationship, I've, I've had friends that had been in relationships like, man, my fucking girlfriend, she's always accusing me of doing this and accusing me of doing that. And I'm like, you got to get break up with her because that, that'll, that'll you'll get sucked into that world. Yeah. You will get sucked into her world of anxiety and craziness and you'll become something different than you are now. You'll become what she's accusing you of being. If you don't become that you at the very least be a mess because you're constantly defending yourself. Like, I'm just going to deal with it. I'll go home, I'll talk to her. Like, this is the, the,

Speaker 2:          01:40:54       that is the embodiment. That is the definition of a codependent relationship. Right? Like you're, you're allowing her to be this accusatory person or he, you know, allow a golden woman with a man. Same thing. It hasn't, it's not sex dependent or gender dependent, but it's this weird thing that happens to people when someone starts pointing at you and saying, you know what, Chris, you're just a fucking asshole. You know you, you just, you don't care about anybody but yourself. And you're like, do I? God Damn it, you start. We'll have to look at yourself and go, is this, is this true? And if someone says it enough, you'll start to think it's true. You start to believe it. So if you get a guy and you lock them up in some fucking cage and everyday you tell him that he's a criminal and you ever day, you tell them you're a terrorist, you're plotting with Isis here.

Speaker 2:          01:41:34       Ah, you fucking put an orange jumpsuit in them and, and then he does want to kill you. Then before you know it, they're fucking memory is so distorted and twisted by years of beatings and you're feeding them dog food and kicking them in the deck. Oh, who is that guy anymore? 14 years in Guantanamo Bay and they let them go. I would be amazed if he doesn't become a terrorist now. Yeah. It would be amazing. No better breeding ground for terrorists than a terrorist in prison or criminal camp. Yeah. Then prison, look at our criminal justice system. It's a Mac. It's not about helping anyone. It's not about reducing crime. It's just responding to some primordial revenge fantasy, which we know perfectly doesn't work, especially for shit like nonviolent crimes, which is a giant percentage of our prisons. Yeah. I mean that is like one of the sickest aspects of our culture that we have more people in prison.

Speaker 2:          01:42:28       Then all the countries in the world, there's no one in any other country including military police states. Yeah. Yeah. It's crazy. It's, it's fucking, it's the land of the free, right home of the brave. That's right. Yeah, and you're going to go to France and sitting in the Back Bay and France and Spain. Same Shit. Oh, it's on the fourth or you're talking about me personally. Well, you are going to escape. I beautiful country here. I'm going to Columbia first though. I think I'm going to go hang on my friend's yacht in the Caribbean for awhile, so hang with that dude. CFLA stay taller if I were really ballsy cause he's, he's doing Christmas with his family elsewhere and I know that Yod is sitting in the British Virgin Islands empty right now with the crew. But just your luck, you'll get on it by herself and that's when the pirates, we'll call him planning on kidnapping.

Speaker 2:          01:43:15       I'll defend it, you know, and like I'm Chris Ryan, I'm an author. I'm not a billionaire. Exactly. We saw your Ted talk be dead is only funded itch. It's good. Yeah. Fucking yachts are weird in that sense in that if you have one Mike man, it's beautiful and it's amazing, but people look at that floating fucking thing and it's a bank. It's like a floating bank inside of it. There's money. You just got to figure out how to extract it. And if you can grab one of those people that's inside of it and take them and whisk them away and then contact the other people and say, hey, you got to give me some of

Speaker 4:          01:43:51       that money. If you want one of these people back. But on the other hand, a yacht, this big e, if you take someone off that yacht, you're going to have some serious guys come and look. And for you, it's not like a couple of old people on a sailboat. Yeah. But if you're in like Mexico, they can't find El Chapo. If you can't get to El Chapo, I ain't going to hear you buy that shit about El Chapo and the tunnel. I don't buy that. What do you mean by it? I don't believe he escaped through the tunnel. Why is that? Because you don't look, he's world famous for being the dude who builds tunnels. Okay, well before they caught him, I didn't know he was famous for being a dude. Oh yeah. He's the dude who has all these tunnels under the border with the train tracks and all that.

Speaker 4:          01:44:34       That's how he's like this major smuggler. Right? Right. So he's the tunnel dude. And he's got all these teams of engineers who are great at building tunnels, and they're always finding them in San Diego on all this. Right. So you finally catch the dude after he's already escaped right from the other one five years ago or whatever that was. She finally catch the dude again. You put them in the most secure prison in Mexico, number one, supermax Mexican prison and dude's are building a tunnel with power tools into the prison and you don't hear it and don't expect it and don't think about it. And they're like at some fucking construction site, a mile outside of the wall of the prison. Then you're not checking that bull shit. Give me a fucking break. This guy paid off the prison guards. That's why they're all arrested now.

Speaker 4:          01:45:23       Paid off the, the head of the prison paid off the senators and the governors and the probably the president and then they built the tunnel to make, give a viable story for the dip shits to like us to listen to and say, Oh, you skated through the Tono. No, he didn't any walked out the fucking front door and got into a limo. Gimme a break, but they need the tunnel. He definitely got out to the tunnel. There's video of it. There's security video. But I agree with you. Who would then all the other ones who gave us the security video of him going behind that little wall and crouching down and disappearing. Who gave us that video here to get them through? Through the autonomy. The tunnel exists. It exists as a story. Oh, that's so strange. You're a conspiracy theorist. That's the dumbest conspiracy ever.

Speaker 4:          01:46:05       The actually told exists, but it doesn't mean he, he used it. That means it exists, so that will say, oh, you got out through the tunnel of what age? We won't look at all the people he paid off. I feel like I'm talking to Eddie Bravo. This is, this is crazy. Of course these deep paid off some people, but I think you paid off some people to allow him to build a tunnel. I think that's the outcomes razor point of view. Yeah, I don't think so. I think the outcomes raise their point of view is with the amount of corruption that we know exists in the Mexican government that he paid people off. The guy's got billions of dollars. You paid people off. They said, okay, but we got to like come up with some cover story. We can't just let you walk out the front door because then it's obvious that you paid us off because there's no other explanation. So we make up this story of how we'll okay have build a tunnel that'll take

Speaker 1:          01:46:50       a couple of months. It's fine. They build the tunnel. We say you went out through the tunnel will leave this fucking evidence and whatever, the little motor bike and all this bullshit. And that's the story. That's the way they do this shit. Well, the tunnel, it was a mile long and they say it took a year. They say it took a year to build. Yeah, but because it had, it had electricity in it. Yeah. It had ventilation. It had an electric bike. Like he hopped on electric bike and shot down to the end of that thing. You don't buy it. I don't put it in Mexico. He's just fucking paint people off. It's the way it works. This securest building in Mexico that is like saying the prettiest gorilla, you know, the security, the most secure prison in Mexico. Mexican prisons are pretty cool actually. If you're going to go to prison, Mexico is a good place.

Speaker 1:          01:47:36       If you have a little money. Oh, if you have bunny, if you have a little money you don't need a lot. But like uh, cause in Mexican prisons, you know like your wife can come visit and stay with you. You can have like good food. People can bring you food, you can get cigarettes, you can watch TV. It's not like American where like you're going to be in a sterile environment. In Mexico there's a lot of their poorest, there's a lot of stuff you have to stay there, but your wife can come, your girlfriend can come, hookers can come. Hookers. Real wow. Yeah. Wasn't that like one of the things that they had been upset about him and the previous incarceration that he had been bringing in prostitutes? Yeah. He had like ran the prison. Yeah, but he got out of that one too. Right.

Speaker 1:          01:48:19       And how do you get out of that one? I'm like, whoa. He said he like went out through the laundry. I think it was like in a laundry thing. Well, there was a story recently, we were actually talking about this in a previous podcast that they had come very close to catching him, uh, like within the last couple of weeks. And then he broke his leg jumping out a window or something. Yeah. They said he believes he broke his leg. Yeah. He was wished away by a security guards. El Chapo, who knows? This is terrifying that this gigantic organized crime empire is built out of the drug war because of prohibition. They've, I mean, it's no different than Al Capone during the alcohol prohibition that we had. Yeah. That's really good. That's, it's really interesting, right? Yeah. Well it's, it's the same mechanism we've been talking about all afternoons crashing. You repress it, the pressure, but it's like a steam engine or a internal combustion engine, you know, create pressure, no release.

Speaker 1:          01:49:13       And then use the energy of the release for your own purposes. Yeah. Just finds a way out. Right. If finds a little valve like my poor girl with her shave vagina, the girl from high school, crazy girl, the poor repress girl down curl was also, this is the first girl that I ever met that told me that she liked it when her boyfriend hit her. Yeah. That was real, cause we work together too. And uh, we were working together and she was crying to me that, you know, this guy that this guy that she was dating beat or the same guy shaved her pussy. He went whole hog. It's crazy dude.

Speaker 2:          01:49:48       But that he had a hit her and uh, and she's like, you know what's fucked up though? I like it. And I was like, whoa. Like I remember thinking like, I don't even know where to begin with this. I go, you like it? She goes, I'm part of it. I don't know what the fuck is. It just turns me on.

Speaker 3:          01:50:03       Yeah. Well that, I mean, that relates to what we were saying earlier. Like we don't choose what we want. We don't choose what feels good. Things feel good. I mean there's a, I mean this is really a fucked up thing to talk about, but it's real. Um, one of the reasons that rape is so psychologically damaging to women is a lot of women come when they're being raped. Yeah. So there that imagine the schism that that creates in your own experience where you're like, one part of you is saying this is the worst fucking violation that's ever happened in this guy has, you know, is a monster and your body's coming. Yeah. Like what the fuck? And I, and see, I think that's similar to what we were talking about with these little boys who are having experiences that gets sealed as a pleasurable experience in one way. Even though later they look back on it and say that was a violation and a crime.

Speaker 2:          01:50:56       So wild. He's such a very, very strange thing because it's not just about reproducing, it's there's psychological aspects to it. There's sociological aspects to it. There's forbidden things that become more appealing because of it. It's so strange. What, what, what exists with human beings and that it doesn't exist at all in any of the animal world. This idea of being conscious and being aware and if also contemplating all the variables and at this sort of combines together with the biological needs of reproduction and it creates this really potent, confusing cocktail of ideas that gets, I mean that's one of the reasons why it's so offensive when you, you find out that someone that you know, uh, has either been raped or someone that you know has been accused of raping someone and they didn't do it or that someone that you know has been involved somehow in a rape, like they were a part of a rape or they maybe were in a gang bang rape or something like that.

Speaker 2:          01:51:57       It's just like, Whoa, my whole world's been thrown upside down. Like this idea of what people can and can't do to each other. It's so crazy. It's human beings like forcing themselves on other human beings is so strange. And then when you hear how many women have rape fantasy, well you like, well, well fuck Jesus Christ. That's what you want. No, no, no, no, no, no. It's what I enjoy thinking about. Well what the fuck does that mean? Do you want to get raped or no, no, no, definitely not. But I fantasize about it. It makes me calm. What? Yeah, what are you saying? Like my buddy was, uh, having sex with his girlfriend once and uh, she admitted while they're having sex that what she really wants is a bunch of black guys to come over and just fuck the shit out of her against her will hold her down and he and he, he'd never thought about it the same way again.

Speaker 2:          01:52:46       It was like he was fucked. Like the relationship was done. It was like he couldn't handle it. Yeah. Like she just wanted big, muscular black guys to come over, just fuck the shit out of it. Him just hold it, shut up bitch and just, Oh, just, and she didn't really want it to happen, but she wanted it to happen like in her head, that was the fantasy, the fantasy. Like when she would be alone, no one's there and she would lock her bedroom door and masturbate. She would be thinking about getting raped. I can some crazy way like that. She wanted that. She didn't want a relationship with that guy. She didn't want that guy to nuzzle her take care of her and cuddle and watch Netflix. No, she wanted that guys come in her body to make some like super potent a child birthed out of violence.

Speaker 3:          01:53:31       Hey animal passion man as fuck though. Right. That's the last remnants of that. Yeah. Well I don't know the last five minutes but I mean, you know the UFC fighting. What's that? You know that's animal passion. That's animal like basic. I mean I know there's art to it and you know the way you look at it's different than the way I look at it. But I look at it and I see two dudes like unleashing the inner beast. It's hard to argue, you know, all the arguments to women and you know in the case of the women. But what about these cases you read about every once in a while where like, like a dude goes to a woman's house at night and she thinks it's her husband and they have sex and then she finds out it was just some guy. What? Yeah, every couple of years you read one of these cases where like some guys like he just walks into a house and had sex with a woman and she's, and then she's like, wait a minute, you're not my husband. Those things seem unbelievable to me, but I've seen them several times.

Speaker 2:          01:54:29       Well, weird things can happen, especially if you're in a situation where like maybe your neighbor has been thinking about fucking your wife forever or the post man. And they're like, maybe they know your schedule. He doesn't come home until nine every night. He works this shift and you know, and I can just get in there on Tuesdays because that's when he's not there for that deck. I know twins who did that. Really? Yeah. Oh, that seems more likely. But he's also a problem with sleeping pills, man. Oh yeah. The ambien fucking you. Yeah. That's fucking very, very dangerous. I've had a bunch of friends, have some really bizarre experiences. Like one of my buddies woke up in the car driving somewhere and realize what he was doing. He had already gotten in the car and was already driving and it was on some sort of weird autopilot when he realized that he was driving somewhere.

Speaker 2:          01:55:17       Yeah, that's heavy. It's very scary because someone can do things to you, I'm sure while you're under the influence of sleeping pills and you would probably just accept it or think it was a part of your dream or you know, or what. But when you're taking something that forces you into that state were, were monkeying with the mind, that sort of sort of strange way. And these companies that make these pills will have you believe that it's safe and easy. It's cause you die. So if you don't die the label it is safe. Look, he, we woke him up or he woke up in the morning and we checked his heart rate. Everything's fine. His blood plates. And how do you feel, Chris? I feel great. Well, I had a wonderful night sleep and in the safe it's safe but it's not necessarily safe. I mean whether it's safe, there's possible potential repercussions for doing that shit and one of them is that something happens to you while you're doing it. I think El Chapo was on Ambien. You think so? That's what happened. Maybe aliens abducted him.

Speaker 3:          01:56:14       Look this, this is how, how fucking easy it is to come in here and talk to you. All right. I came in thinking, I dunno what we're going to talk about. We just talked a month ago. I don't have anything new to talk about so I made a couple of notes. I haven't, I haven't gotten either one of them. We always have shit to talk about it. You really worried about that? Well, I feel bad. I mean if it's just you and me hanging out and Jamie, that's fine, but if there are a million people listening in there like that, that asshole was just on there a few weeks ago. I don't want to hear his shit again. Don't worry about those people. Can't think about that there. Those people are really nice. Actually. Most of them are nice and looked at asked majority. Yeah. I mean like, you know, everyone talks about how the Internet brings out the asshole and everybody.

Speaker 3:          01:56:50       Right. But like the, the people who, you know, go to the trouble of rating my podcast or putting comments, they're fucking beautiful. Like if I'm feeling down I go read them. Like, Oh, do you guys love me? It's beautiful. Well you're giving them something for free. That's awesome sometimes, but it's a cool exchange, you know. Yeah. I actually, I think I might've mentioned the last time I was on that, you know, you and Duncan had sort of, you know, when we get together and talk about the future, I'm like the Dutch, what I'm going to die. But, uh, I read this book called future perfect by Steven Johnson and uh, I got a bunch of books that I was going to trash, right? Like there's the rational optimist by Matt Ridley and there are a couple of books that are all like, oh, everything's great. And I was like, okay, I'll respond to these arguments.

Speaker 3:          01:57:42       Cause, obviously I'm making a different argument so I should acknowledge them. So I trashed Matt Ridley, I trash Steven Pinker, I trashed from other people and then I read this a future. Perfect. And it's like fuck this guy's right. He's right. He's makes really good arguments. And they're very much along the lines of what you were saying about the power of unfiltered media that's happening, that's unleashed by the Internet, creating these emergent, uh, peer networks that never could have existed before. So good ideas can spread really quickly and get capital really quickly if it's a, you know, business sort of, or money distribution kind of thing. And therefore, uh, things can change. Like I'm thinking, I'm looking back at every civilization that's ever existed and they fail, fail. They all collapsed and they all follow the same patterns, but there wasn't this sort of immediate world, global mind. And now there is. And as I said earlier, you know, Homo Sapiens sapiens that harmony that knows it knows what does it know. It knows it's going to die. The first thing that consciousness becomes aware of is its own mortality. Right. So what I'm hoping is that when this global mind clicks on as I think it's happening right now, that's when we become aware of our mortality as a species and as a planet. And maybe there's some like radical transformative power in that and we'll all end up living like Joe Rogan in a hundred years.

Speaker 2:          01:59:10       Definitely thing there's a radical transform formative power of the instant exchanging of ideas and information because the, the good ideas, they get vetted out, like everybody's ideas get discussed and bandied about. And even, you know, podcasts, ideas, like there's some ideas that people, uh, you know, throw out on podcasts and they get debated and everybody gets, there's so much intensity and so much, you know, discussion and debate about who's right and who's wrong. And it's because I think one of the reasons why people have so much of a vested interest in these things is they recognize the significance of exposing ideas for what they truly are and trying to figure out which ones are good and which ones are bad. And also the repercussions of living in a world filled with bad ideas and bad assumptions that we're all acting on. And we've all, whether it's racism or homophobia or the fucking Federal Reserve or the fucking two party system, these things, all these things we know by virtue of like examining all the facts like, God, this is not the best way to do this, but this is the system that we're stuck with.

Speaker 2:          02:00:12       So when we're making communities and even if they're open ended online communities of people exchanging ideas, there's still kind of communities like people I talk with on Twitter are people, uh, that I, I read their Facebook posts or this is a, there is a community to that because we are exchanging information. We all communicating with each other, right? And there's a community that comes with podcasts as well. I mean, the people that are listening to this right now, the millions of people that will get ahold of this conversation, they're a part of a community. And whether or not they agree or disagree or hate or love, there's still in somehow or another, there's still in some way communing with each other. We're, we're, we're talking and communicating and everybody has this ability now to exchange ideas and the good ones sort of resonate. And because of that, I think we can exchange ideas and evolve ideas and, and evolve our own perceptions of things in a much, much, much quicker way than ever before and ever in the history of the human race. Quick. One of the reasons why I'm so optimistic.

Speaker 3:          02:01:17       Yeah. And I agree with you and that's what this book really, he really gets into that and examples of it, what's it called? It's called future perfect. And the author is Steven Johnson. And like he talks about Kickstarter and how, you know, Kickstarter two years after it was launched, it was already funding more art than the National Endowment for the arts. Wow. You know, in two years. And uh, I mean, I, you know, you're talking about how things resonate and, and they happen quicker. And I think another aspect of it is that until now, the ideas that became powerful had to have market appeal. You had to be able to make money from it somehow. Whereas now like here you are here, we push this button, this, I mean it costs nothing to produce these things, these podcasts, right? They go out. If the idea is good, a million people hear about it, that resonates further. It doesn't matter if it's a sellable idea, it just matters if it's a good idea. Whereas before, when all the media was controlled by companies that needed to be making money somehow, right? It had to have that commercial appeal. A lot

Speaker 2:          02:02:24       of times people wouldn't even venture into something like this unless they thought that it was profitable. Right. You know, when I got into this, I did it entirely just for fun. I think it's one of the reasons why it's been successful is that I had no, no ulterior motive at all. Like it was just fun. I just saw a lot of fun we'd be doing and we started doing these a long time ago. Um, uh, a platform called Justin TV we were doing from the group member who would stream from a laptop card. I used to have this, a Verizon card is ticking my laptop, which stream from green rooms in between shows and it would just be us fucking around and talking to the camera and maybe we'd add answered questions or something like that. If there was a chat and there was never a thought like, hey, this is going to be really profitable someday.

Speaker 2:          02:03:11       So let's make sure that our guests are only like really acceptable mainstream guests that we know we're going to get a lot of attention and sometimes I'll get complaints about that. Like how come you keep having your friends or some hunter dude or some comedian or a fighter that I don't know. How come you can't run and how come you can't get Obama black? Marion got Obama, you know, how can you, how come you don't get Steven Spielberg won't look fat fucking I'm not even trying. How about that? I just want to have conversations. If I really wanted to have a conversation with Obama, I don't know even know if it is possible because I think if the fucking secret service, listen to any of the shit that I've said before, they'd probably, yeah, I'd probably be removed from the discussion. But I mean, I feel like there's some people that I probably could talk to that I'm not drawn to that I'm not drawn to them.

Speaker 2:          02:04:01       I'm not, I'm not interested in it, but if I am interested in them, I'll pursue them. Like there's some famous people that I find fascinating. I would love to talk to them. Verna Hertz, thug dude. Yeah, I would, but not just because they're famous. No, but if you have a talk show, like if you have the tonight show or something along those lines, you can't do a show like that unless you have famous people on that. That's the whole model. Right? That's, that's the only way to do it. And it's someone pitching something. Right, exactly. It's going to be, don't get to choose. That's the other problem. If you're the host of one of those shows and you're a part of some multimedia conglomerate like NBC or universal or whatever the fuck it is, they're going to bring all these people, this is Mike, blah blah blah.

Speaker 2:          02:04:40       He's got this fucking fast and furious 47 coming out and you know, and you've got to have that guy. What was it like on the set working with Michelle Rodriguez? Oh man, she's crazy. First of all, we're just like a tight knit family. We would go in. This film is amazing and I got a real big thanks out to Steven Spielberg for produce all that bullshit. It's this through. It was great. It's nonsense, it's nonsense and that's all you're ever going to get. And these little seven minute sound bites in between commercials. You do the seven minutes, we'll be right back. All right. And then you go to commercial and then fucking tie. Toyota Woo. Bababa Abilify or do you feel depressed? And then next thing you know, Bam, new guest and their new top 40 song. I love apples and the fucking sing their stupid song and then a, all right, thanks for coming.

Speaker 2:          02:05:22       We'll be back next week with Tom Cruise. We got Oprah Winfrey, you know, it's like the flaws, the flaws signs Kim Kardashian and you know you're going to watch these famous heads say non thing, say nonsense. And that's all those shows are. And that's one of the reasons why those shows are they're they, they, they, they're an old, it's an old model. And I think that model is not going to work in this new world, this new world of computers and the Internet and phones and this new world wants real information. They want to know who the fuck are you. You don't like you or don't like you. You're you. And Chris Ryan is Chris Ryan. Every time I've seen you talk, you're you. And that's what people like and that's what resonates. They know whether or not they agree with you or disagree with you. They know where you're coming from as a place of honest consideration.

Speaker 2:          02:06:12       And I tried to do that as well. Everything I tried to do, I try, whether I'm right or I'm wrong, if I get it wrong or I'm clunky or I'm coming, I'm not trying to be anything other than who I am. You know? And I think we're all in this together and we're all learning and evolving and growing and expanding our ideas together. And I think one of the beautiful things about podcasts is that you get to share this with other people. And there's a lot of people right now, and it might be listening to this and a truck on the way to somewhere and they got fucking three hours to go and there and they're thinking about shedding. It's enriching their ideas and their expanding their own ideas because of it. And maybe they're adding something in their head. They're thinking, you know why these guys are right, but you know what else?

Speaker 2:          02:06:50       What about this? And then they have their own idea from that. And maybe that could become a fucking business opportunity for them or a book that they write or they start their own podcast. I've gotten fucking hundreds and hundreds of messages from people that said they started their own podcasts from listening to this and that alone, who knows, you could nail some fucking podcast and that podcast might be the best thing that anybody's ever heard before and it might all come out of you hearing tangentially speaking or the Duncan Trussell family hour or whatever. And I think in that sense, like everybody has a voice now, you know, in some really unique way that never existed before. And what you were saying about like the guy in the truck as you were saying that, I was thinking one of the things that I really,

Speaker 3:          02:07:36       yeah, we were earlier talking about a radio lab and I, I said I was Sorta, I found it sort of annoying how produced it is. I think one of the things that's cool about your show, my show Dunkin show, these conversational shows that aren't highly produced and edited, is that that guy in the truck, he's listening to us, have a conversation in real time. So it's really easy for him to imagine himself participating. Whereas if you're listening to something where everything's cut in real tight and you know controlled, you can't insert yourself into that world because that's not a real world.

Speaker 2:          02:08:08       Maybe that's why I like radio lab is cause I'm so used to this and I do this so often. I'm doing this three times, sometimes four times even we've done five a week on some weeks that when I go to something like radio lab, I could just sit down and absorb the information and also because I think it's so good. It's great. There's so much matters. It's incredible. But I could see your point. Like sometimes it annoys me when they edit, like someone's in the middle of talking and then they'll explain in a paraphrased way what that guy actually wound up saying. Well how about you let him say it? Right? Like why did you have to chime in? And we missing 10 15 seconds of his explanation. Is it too verbose? Like why, why you got to cut in? But they're doing it because they kind of liked doing that.

Speaker 2:          02:08:48       They like being clever with the sound. That's their art. I mean, they're creating this thing like my, one of my all time favorites is Dan Carlin's hardcore history. It's amazing. We've heard the newest one. Oh good Lord. It might be best Africa. We just out what, what's the doubt about the Assyrians? All my God. Oh my God. It's good. He's great. Oh, he's the best. You had them on your, yes. I love that guy. He's a fucking national treasure. He makes people think about history and in a way it's exciting and it's, it's, it's a, you could digest it, you know?

Speaker 3:          02:09:21       Yeah. I was, I was, uh, taking a walk the other day and I was listening to one of his, um, the series about world

Speaker 2:          02:09:26       war one and yeah, it's amazing. Something of doom. Yeah. Um, no. Uh, that prophets of doom I think was the one about, um, here, I'll pull it. It's like a seven, seven part series. Each one's two or three hours long. But it has always, I was listening, I was thinking how, cause I used to think history was boring, right when I was in high school. It was like, yeah, fucking history class for Armageddon. That's what, that's it. Yeah. All about world war one. Oh my God. Incredible Shit. And like the way he tells the story and the details of the research is like, this is the most interesting shit I can imagine listening to and history was boring. Like how hard you have to work to make this boring. Well, I think there's a difference between has, I mean it's one of the reasons why he makes the distinction that he's not a historian. You know, he's like, and although I do consider him one, he won't consider himself one because he's so humble. But what he's doing is he's adding this, the dramatic flare of a professional broadcaster and then really excellent one and that really excellent, um, uh, entertainer

Speaker 4:          02:10:34       and he's, he's distributing how to use this voice. Well, yeah, he's so good dramatically with his paws and winning quotes, you know, he changes his voice fucking good. The new one's even better than the other ones. I think he's getting better as that sounds and Danieli Bolelli now it's in the ring. That's true. Yeah. Yeah. He was just fucking love that guy. And his new podcast is really excellent to the beginning of the first one. It's just like self, it's about a story. And that he had actually told me on the podcast and I remember saying, what the hell? Yeah, I do. I explain it to anybody cause I don't want to, I don't want to blow any of the suspense and the craziness of the first story, but not zero, zero, which is a kind of, when he's explaining it, but episode one block, that story's so twisted when you find out what people were capable of doing to each other.

Speaker 4:          02:11:25       Just a few hundred a thousand, 2000 years ago. Right now we're blowing up people in Yemen. I mean, and they say only 10% of the people who get blown up are the ones we're aiming at. 90% are innocent bystanders. Yeah, yeah. Well I mean this drones in this book I'm almost finished with now the argument is that civilization is sick, right? Civilization itself is a sick system. Um, partly because it's built on the repression of natural urges and then you know, all this distortion and all that. So when you look at like all these stories that people are talking about their world war one, we don't even know what they're fighting about, right. You know, and the poison in each other and they're blowing shit up and they're destroying the landscape and it's dropping tons of munitions and all this shit. And uh, or Columbus, when Columbus landed, you know, he'd fucking, you know, the letter he wrote back to the queen when he first landed and he spend Yola was like, these people are so beautiful and they're so generous.

Speaker 4:          02:12:26       If you express admiration for anything, they just give it to you. And there's food everywhere and fish everywhere and fruit and they're beautiful. The swim and they're half naked and they're lovely, lovely people with 50 soldiers, we can enslave the entire population. It's like, Oh, who civilized here? You know, the guy who's like, fuck you. And he's cutting off people's hands cause they're not bringing them enough gold and there is no goal. And then they're sending the dogs on them and watching them rip their guts out and slam and babies against trees were the civilized ones. Then it was all break explained in really great detail by some religious person that was involved with that. Right.

Speaker 4:          02:13:06       What was his position? What would, he was a Jesuit and he wrote, um, the conquest, the conquest of new Spain was, uh, Diaz. That's a really interesting book that's about, uh, the Aztec thing where they went and took over Montezuma. But, uh, de Las Casas was a Jesuit who saw this happening and um, the wrote all these treaties, treaties is, or essays decrying the treatment of the natives and he's, he, his point was like, they're human beings and we're not treating them like human beings. And then supple Veda argued they're not human beings, they don't have souls. So we're free to do what we want. And they had this famous debate at the Vatican between those two perspective. Like are they human or not? Are they, you know, do, are we justified in treating them like animals and a de Las Casas one but didn't matter. You know, my question is it's pretty much universally accepted.

Speaker 4:          02:14:04       The Columbus was a con. Yeah. And that he was a horrible evil person. But how did it take us until 2015 before we recognize that? How the fuck did that guy get a Monday? Well, how did he get a day off? The same, same reason. The fucking, those heads are carved into the black hills in South Dakota, right? It's like it was what we were saying earlier, assist them once as if, as if it's a living thing is system adopts the subsystems that perpetuated a, so that's a good way of describing it. You know, you're an expensive, uh, empire system. So you celebrate those who expanded the empire. It doesn't matter if they were cons, right? Right. Because what they did is something that serve the interest of the system. And so when I'm trying to get at in this book is that what serves the interest of the system is not what serves the interest of the individuals within the system.

Speaker 4:          02:14:59       So the fact that, you know, people often say, well obviously the human race is amazing because you know, so successful because look, there's 7 billion of us now and there were only a hundred million 500 years ago, whatever it is. And my argument is like, well wait a minute. Like they're way more prisoners in America now than there were 50 years ago. Does that mean prisoners are thriving? You know, the fact that there are more of a given species doesn't mean that that individuals within that species are living better than premium. Not at all. It's, it's also the same sort of logic that would say, well obviously being a king and being royal is special and these are special people. That's why they have power over all these other people. Like, no, these are the people just don't have any power. Right. There's only you, you're the king. Like they, that's a stupid way of looking at it and the system gives you that power and you just happened to have been plugged into that spot.

Speaker 4:          02:15:50       Yeah. Yeah. And the idea that this is the only way to do things well, this is because we are the best of version. Like if you want to look at America as far as like productivity and innovation, and we're the best version right now currently on this planet. But that doesn't mean this is the best way to do it. And it doesn't mean that if we found a planet somewhere that was filled with human beings that spoke a language that we could all understand, but they just lived fucking way more harmonious than us. They had no garbage. Everything was completely recycled. There was never any waste. They kept a very strict, uh, uh, understanding of their environment and what they were doing to it and how many babies they had and how they treated

Speaker 2:          02:16:30       each other. And they never allowed property to exist. They never allowed extreme depression or any things that we have that we just push aside or throw pills at, are fucking put fences up for. We would go, oh my God were retarded. Why didn't we live like this? And we could live like this and small sustainable groups like these tribes that we were talking about, right? We're talking about the way they would take care of the village and then everybody would take care of each other and they'd live in these harmonious communities. And it's not saying they don't have disputes. It's not saying they don't disagree about things because all people are constantly debating about ideas and they all have their own unique and different perspectives. But when we get to this gigantic group, whether it's a 300 million in America or 7 billion worldwide, there's this massive diffusion of responsibility for the residual effects of our civilization.

Speaker 2:          02:17:19       It's cigarettes out the window and fucking poop in the ocean or whatever it is. Like we somehow under the don't feel responsible for all that. Although ultimately it comes from humans. If we found some group that had figured that out, we found some planet that was filled with people that didn't have anything that we don't have. They had computers, they had cars, but they had figured all this other shit out and they had just, they just say, well, this is more important than anything else we're doing. Let's, let's engineer this first. Let's figure this out. First we would realize that we're living like apes with phones and guns. That's where it, yeah, like I had this joke in part of the joke was about like if we went to, uh, to the zoo or went to the Congo, we found some rare spot in the Congo and we, we ran into these chimps and they had figured out cell phones and rocket launchers, but all they were doing is taking pictures of their dicks and shooting each other in the face would be like, what? That's us are you guys do it? But that is us. That is us. That is what we're doing. It's true. I mean, we're not, it's, we're not only taking pictures of our dicks and knowing only shooting each other in the face, but for doing a lot of it, there's a lot of Dick pics and there's a lot of people getting shot in the face. And a lot of it is die. Robots that are flying around the sky, killing 90% of the wrong people.

Speaker 3:          02:18:28       Well, sex and, and military are the two main drivers of economics, right? I mean, yeah. The W is Eo Wilson said, uh, he's great biologist. He said humans are, uh, the tragedy of humanity is that we have stone-age instincts, medieval institutions and god, like powers technology. That's a beautiful way describing it. Yeah. Yeah. And it's, it's a mess. Yeah. I mean what you described like, oh, we go to this, this planet and find these people. And then that's very similar to the story that is told over and over and over again at first contact between civilized people and native people. Now when I say native people, keep in mind, I look at the Aztecs or the Inca as they're civilized, right? It's, it's not European, but they're living in hierarchical, large scale civilizations. Agricultural civilization, right? Yeah. They're, they're native. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          02:19:26       Might not know about a lot of the things of the Europeans knew about. And they probably can choose that shit out of slaves and all that shit. So I'm not so, cause a lot of times people will be like, Oh man, you know, the fucking hystrix ripped their hearts. I'm not, the Aztecs are the same as the Spaniards, right. I'm talking about Nate low scale a hunter gatherer bands where everybody knows each other, right. And nomadic, right. Which in is tribal people oftentimes it live in jungles and things along those lines. There's a lot of resources and there's no fight for resource. Yeah. Because the population is standing is, and it's steady. Right, right. Um, you know, there are all sorts of reasons for that, but that's the story you get. Again and again in this book, I quote this, um, this Jesuit who lived with a Munton Yay Indians in what's now Quebec.

Speaker 4:          02:20:13       And he says like, you know, they really enjoy life and they're not worried about dying. They're not worried about being hungry because they save the world provides for them. They look around, they're like, yeah, there's food everywhere. And he says, like, I tried to talk to them and they, if they get a beaver, they have a feast. Even if you know the, the, the guys next door got a beaver in, they're having a feast to, and if they get three beavers, they'll have three fees and it just eat till everything's gone. And when I say to them like, why don't you save something for tomorrow? They say, well, we'll catch something tomorrow. And they're like, well, what if you don't? Well then we'll be hungry. Don't worry. I mean, it's no big deal there. There's always enough. Well, they lived in a different world to where there wasn't as massive fucking quantity of human beings that are literally pulling everything out of the land.

Speaker 4:          02:20:56       Yeah. So you need that huge population to support the scarcity mindset. Well, here's one good example of information being distributed and how it's benefiting even the environment here in North America at the turn of the century, there was a point in time where we had wiped out like a giant majority of the game animals on this planet because just like they did with the buffalo and they just fucking slaughtered the buffalo and buffalo bill is a national hero. All right. You're talking about Columbus. Sure. Full of fucking bill. That's what he's famous for. Shot him and left them there to rot. Yeah. What'd they do? They took the hides, right? That's all they, that's all they talk. And mostly it was just to starve the Indians. The hides were like, yeah, that's why they did it. Because they were, that's when they were building the railroads across the great plains.

Speaker 4:          02:21:48       Indians kept kicking their ass and so they're like, well, you know, they're kicking our ass so let's starve them out. Take away their food source. Yeah. You know, it's also interesting, we haven't reintroduced the Buffalo, like the buffalo is the one animal that if you look at like they've reintroduced wolves. All right. And to a great many people's dismay because they're starting to attack livestock. But that livestock in and of itself is one of the reasons why they haven't reintroduce buffalo. Right? Because people are scared because if they bring buffalo back, buffalo are beautiful, majestic creatures, but say goodbye it all your hey bitch. Well, buffaloes use much less water. Cows do. Oh

Speaker 1:          02:22:26       yeah, they're much better environmental. Well they can. I mean, they're fucking hardy. Hardy are. And they can withstand really cold. Oh yeah. Will they have blankets? They're built in blankets, but they eat a lot. Have you seen one like in la? All in? Only in like a fenced in area. It's like a Mousse. It's like wow, that's so big. Yeah. Yeah. Bigger. Even. Well not only that, they look like prehistoric wooly and Florian is a crazy thing called the muskox Tibet. Well they have them in um, um, uh, Antarctic I believe it is. And they also have them in Greenland and people go to Greenly hunting these things and they apparently tasted delicious like rib eyes. Like they're marbled cause there's got the long hair, right? Yeah. But they look like, like star wars creatures look like a real animal, this big furry thing with horns and it's running around and the frozen snow, you're like, what the fuck is that?

Speaker 1:          02:23:23       But these animals can survive in places where we couldn't imagine surviving and they thrive out there. And this frozen Tundra, these big gigantic, you know, 2000 pound beast covered and far and god, it's amazing. But what my point was that there was a point in time where we had driven a giant majority of these animals to extinction. Now because of the symbiotic relationship, especially like white tail deer have with agriculture and human settlement, there's more deer in America today than they were when Columbus was here. Right. Which is nuts. And it's because of intervention. It's because of management is because like these, these, uh, fishing game groups if recognize the problems and if regulated the amount of a hunting that people can do, but also worked really hard to protect habitat and preserve habitat. And that's one of the things with these national forests. In fact, Teddy Roosevelt was one cause he was a, an avid outdoorsman and a hunter.

Speaker 1:          02:24:25       He is the reason why we have these national forests and national parks. He and with great resistance, he put that in place and he turned on his own class. He was an interesting cat. His mother and his wife died on either the same day or the same week. Whoa. Yeah, he had a really bad week. Um, it might've been the same day, but he was back in New York. I think he was a governor or a senator and like his fucking life fell apart and he's from this really wealthy family, right? Obviously the Roosevelts, they were already a very wealthy family and as a way, a little bit like Wim Hoff and as a way of dealing with his grief, he was like, fuck it, I'm out of here. He quit. And he went out to Montana, I think, and worked on a ranch and he was a sick kid. Um, which is why he sort of like over compensated in a way with all the macho and you know, all this stuff. And he worked on that ranch. That's where he really

Speaker 4:          02:25:24       fell in love with the natural world and you know, it became this. And then he went back and became secretary of the navy, I think, and uh, fought in the Spanish American war and you know, his political career took off from there. He established an independent party wasn't like the Buffalo Party or something like that. Wasn't that one of the Times that he ran for president? Yeah. It was in buffalo though, is like the Bull Moose Moose. Right, right, right. Yeah, that's right. And he and John Muir, we're friends who is John Muir again, a great naturalist who wrote about Yosemite and convinced a Roosevelt to make Yosemite national park, maybe the first national park. Isn't it ironic that that's probably what's going to kill every single person on this entire continent? When Yosemite blows on that motherfucker in Yellowstone, Yellowstone, you choose those two for whatever easy yellow, the y. That's fucking goddamn terrifying to me.

Speaker 4:          02:26:19       Yeah, that's a big one. That's, that's pretty cool. There's always love that shit. Did you see that storm yesterday? Oh yeah. It was beautiful. I like, I like when nature just says, fuck you. You know that was barely a fuck you. That was like, no, but first la, that was whether it was like I was, I was sitting up in the Soho House. You've been up there in Hollywood? No, I never have. It's pretty cool. It's like it's the top floor of, and it's up on the hill anyway. So you can see all the way to the ocean where all the rich people, they become like members of this place. And it's like a status symbol spot. Yeah. Why'd you get in there? Cause I have rich status symbol friends. What is it like in there? It's cool. It's nice. I mean there are no cameras allowed.

Speaker 4:          02:27:04       So like what happens if you pull out your phone? Actually what happened yesterday when that storm system came in, I'll, I'll show you a picture. You know when we, when he finished, but it was so beautiful because it was really late and the sun was like right on the horizon and these crazy clouds came in really quickly and then it was raining and the sun and there were rainbows and like, you know the, when the rays of the sun come down and you know something's Jacob's ladder, I think it's called. So everybody was like pictures and all the waiters are like, no photos, no photos. And everyone's like, fuck you, we're doing this soho rebellion. Yeah. But nobody first celebrities, they do it right because they didn't want people like surreptitiously look, look, Joe Rogan talking to somebody. But it's so hard when you have a phone with a camera and everyone has a phone.

Speaker 4:          02:27:51       Everyone's phone as a camera. You're not supposed to pull out the phone in the place that you can go out on the terrace where you can smoke and whatever and talk and text or whatever. So they ask you when you go there, please do not use your phone while you're eating. Can you taxed while you're eating? I don't think you're supposed to have your phone out of your pocket in sign, but everybody's got a computer. They have a computer. Yeah, everybody's working. Cause it's a place where you can go and work all day and there are tables. It's like a lounge. Yeah. Yeah. You can get some food, have a coffee, but you

Speaker 1:          02:28:22       can sit there. Is it like a restaurant as well? I thought it was, yeah. There's a rat in the, in the back there's a restaurant area, but the main thing like there's a pool table there. It's like a cool place to hang out. But we're all the like she, she people hang out. Well honestly, I mean I probably been there five or 10 times and you know, I can't remember seeing anyone that I recognized as being famous wealthy folks. I think it's, it's people in the entertainment business. So there are a lot of producers and scream screenwriters and you know, and some actors will go in there, whatever. But I think the idea, it's not like my impression anyway is that it's not about like going and being seen. It's about going and not having to deal with the shit, but still being in public.

Speaker 1:          02:29:11       So you can be in public, people will be cool. They respect your privacy, you can hang out and work, you can have meetings there, you can, you know, do your business there, whatever. And also it's a network. There's one in New York, there's one in London. I've heard of them before, but I've always thought that they were just like, like Hob knobbing celebrity spot. So since you know me, Joe, I could probably talk to someone that gets you out of want to go. This is, I'm a member of the comedy store, the only club I want to go to know. There's this a weird thing about being in that sort of a circle of like privileged folks that I try to avoid as much as possible. It's a lot of people enjoy that a little too much and it becomes like something that they, uh, they, they just, it's just become something a little too precious to them.

Speaker 1:          02:29:55       Yeah. I don't get that vibe there, but maybe I'm just not paying attention. I'm only getting it third hand through people that know people that go there, that want to become a part of it and they talk about, I'm like, what is this? What? Then I realized I can't be in this conversation. I got to get out of here. I feel that way about Americans. Actually, when I'm in Spain and I hear American accents, I'm like, yeah, I'm going to go down here. Nothing against Americans. But you know, when, I mean, I don't know if I'm resonating with what you're talking about, but it's like I know that world too. Well, I'm not here to be in that world. I want to be in another world was also think that there's a certain amount of reaching for, uh, for things that some folks will do when they achieve a level of, uh, financial success.

Speaker 1:          02:30:43       And they still feel like empty as they want some sort of exclusivity. So they like to go to the admirals lounge, you know what I mean? At the airport. And you know what I mean? Like this hat. But the other thing to get with the hats, but you know what I mean? Sure. There's like exclusive things that make them feel special. Vip Lounge. Yeah. Yeah. God, I want to get a bottle service behind the velvet rope. Ooh. Well that's when you know you've, you're, you know, you're, you're a sucker for it. That's when you're hooked. People love that velvet rope. It's right there. I can't even get through it. Look at it as a barrier.

Speaker 3:          02:31:20       It's like a forced to tell you what the guy I was with, uh, he's a really good friend of mine. He's a wonderful guy. Uh, grew up in Hollywood. He's right now, he's homeless. He's given up his apartment cause he's doing this movie about dolphins. So he's down in Florida a lot of times and then he's in Mexico and he's doing all this stuff. And uh, I'm not, I hope I haven't said enough to give him away, but he's like, he's essentially, I was giving him shit. He's a pussy vagabond. He's like sleeping with different women every night and he's using their houses. Yeah, that's gross. No, they're all friends and they, all they'll know is, they all know about each other, so he's not lying to anyone, but he's like, yeah, when I'm in La, I don't really need an apartment. I can stay in a hotel if I went to, but it usually I'm sleeping with one of my friends and then I go to the so house and that's where I work. And it's like, all right, that's a pretty good system, you know. And then he has his computer. He works there and then he's off to Miami to do some more filming.

Speaker 2:          02:32:13       I have a buddy who's a, a wealthy real estate guy and his house is basically a hostel for really hot, semi semi homeless girls. Like a Charles Manson without the killing. No, no, no, because like, it's always like some new one that is living with them and they almost always have like a little dog and they're like, they just get kicked out of their apartment and no, you could stay with me. And then when I'm staying with him and it's like this battle he has to, he's an older guy and he was like, shit, it was hard for him to fuck them. You know, occasionally he does get the fuck, but sometimes I'm like, dude, you got to get away from her. What are you doing? She's fucking, but it's, that's what he does. He has like one after another of these like semi homeless girls, they don't have any place to go. And they wind up staying with him and they were usually really hot. And that's their currency. The currency is that they're pretty and, but you know,

Speaker 3:          02:33:04       symbiotic in a sad skirt away. Yeah. Do you ever hear a video about Father Yod, Father Yod? Just talk about that. It's called the, the, uh, the source family. He was this doot. Oh, you should watch that. That's a really interesting, so he was this documentary. Yeah, it's a document, I think it's called the source family. And so father Yod was this dude who started the first vegetarian restaurant in America and he was in Hollywood and it became like a place where Goldie Hawn or some, you know, I don't know. People in the early sixties were going and uh, it'd be, you know, Dennis Hopper and that kind of scene. Right. And then it became a cult and he ended up like basically marrying like 30 women or something. But he was this big charismatic dude. He was like, Charles Manson without the nastiness, right. Check out the movie. It'll blow your mind. I won't tell you any more because like, it takes turns that you don't see coming. And it tells you a lot about what la was like in the sixties and seventies well, oh,

Speaker 2:          02:34:06       I was like, I mean the whole country was thrown on its head in the 60s like no one knew what the fuck to expect as soon as that acid and marijuana got into the system post Vietnam or during Vietnam?

Speaker 4:          02:34:18       During Vietnam. The whole system went wacky. Yeah. And he was, I mean you'll relate to him in some ways cause he was like physically he was a really serious dude. Like he was a green baret I think. And he had killed a couple of people and then he like spun out into drug addiction or alcohol or something and then he got his shit together. But he was just so fucking charismatic that like people just gathered around him all the time. But at that, if you watch it and we'll talk further, I don't want to say anything else because I'm really interested in Netflix or apple. Yeah. It's somewhere out there. The source fan source family and also that Verner Herzog thing, encounters at the end of the world. I don't mean to be giving you homework, homework that's, and you like her. It's this same pad.

Speaker 4:          02:35:09       Has Sierra Lynch on it for the last time you were here? Like my brain is not. Yeah. Is this your, like when Chris Ryan's here? I guess I haven't been writing that many notes. I mean there's other notes that aren't from here. Oh, well I'm honored man. And you're taking some notes. The end of the world. What does it encounters ferner her to see the one about, um, the, uh, the cave art in three d, You know, I've been to less SCO in the real cave was crazy only with an official invitation from the French government. Yeah. Because, um, the people affected with their breathing. Yeah. Yeah. That was a crazy day, man. That was, that was awhile ago. I'm like looking at those things in person and knowing that someone 40,000 years ago or whatever, 25 unless Sko, but some of them, some of them are 40.

Speaker 4:          02:36:03       The writing on this wall that long ago, like a bowl, right? It's the bison and it's like as big as that wall behind you. It's like three or four meters long and maybe two or three meters high and it's red ochre. Wow. It's just extraordinary because like as her talk shows in that movie, they use the contour of the rock to accentuate the contours of the body of the animal. So like there's a bulge in the rock and that's in the shoulder of the bison and the fucking amazing. But I'll tell you that. I mean, let's go. It's a real honor to be invited. And it was only because I was with Stanley Kripner and Stanley goddess invited his assistant doing, he's already, he's in China right now. Stoppable they invite him every year to go to China and speak about shamanism, I think. Wow. He was an interesting guy. I was really fascinating when you brought him in here. He's really fascinated by listening to his words and I'm really glad you did that too because he's, you know, he's 85 or something. He's not going to be around forever. But, uh, he's really underappreciated because he's, he's published 25 books and 700 scientific papers and you know, but he never saw it. The media

Speaker 1:          02:37:16       or anything. But he was on the Johnny Carson show a few times. What's he really about? What? Well, he was the guy, he was like the go to guy in the late sixties early seventies when you were talking about psychics. So like he would go with the amazing Kreskin, you know, do you remember the amazing crush spoon bending and all that. So they would have doctor crib neuron to sort of, you know, monitor the, the experiment and you know, try to catch Kreskin and lay his trickery and all this stuff. And so yeah, I joke with Stanley that his Rolodex has like three people under the amazing, the amazing Randy, the amazing Kreskin and some other amazing, amazing Randy. He's a fascinating cat too cause he sort of set out to try to disprove as much of that shit as possible even though that's how he started out. Well he's a magician as, as Stanley.

Speaker 1:          02:38:08       Yeah. So magicians are really skeptical because they make a living tricking people so they know how easy it is to do. When I did that, a Scifi show, we had this guy on, his name is Ben a check and he's fucking amazing. If that shit amazing. I mean he did the spoon bending thing right in front of my, I couldn't figure out what the hell he was doing, but he's super adamant about what he does. What I'm doing is just tricks, right? These are tricks. I don't have any powers. This is, I can't tell you how I'm doing it because this is my thing and I'm, I'm you know, making a living doing this. But I'll tell you right now, it's bullshit. I'm really good at this bullshit, but it's bullshit. But I mean he was amazing. And when he would pull information out of people about their childhood and guests things and explain where they came from and like how, it was just like mind blowing.

Speaker 1:          02:38:57       And I'm like, how the fuck are you doing? This? Wouldn't say, but he would say, I'm not telling you I'm doing this, but I'm telling you right now, I'm not psychic. This is all fakery. It's all bullshit. But he would get furious when he would like the long island medium or one of those shows where they had people and tell them about their dead relatives. He's like, this is, these are crooks, these are, these are, these people are shit. Like they're ruining people. They're stealing money from people with their trickery and the people who are grieving, vulnerable. Come on. And I look in the, Ah, ah, that's the saddest shit about people that are, that go after folks that are hurting, you know, like with their loss and then they say he's talking to you from behind the, beyond the grave. I feel like he's reaching out to you and he's happy with where you are and he just wants you to, there's something that you're about to do. Is there something you're thinking about doing all this, this business project? Yes. That's, that's it. That's it. Yeah. And the fucking monsters. Okay. Then extrapolate from that to the American medical system where 30% of all Medicaid is spent in the last month of people's lives. Does that really the amount? I think so. Meanwhile, mushrooms, it could grow mushrooms. It's giving them that a fraction. Is that, what is it when you're doing a hip replacement on a 90 year old blind lady? Fucking

Speaker 4:          02:40:14       again, you know, or you know it. No, there's this experimental treatment we can try on grandma. You know, it's going to like all her hair's gonna fall out and she won't be able to see, but you know, we'll get $40,000 from your insurance company. It's the same thing, you know, it's so fucking

Speaker 2:          02:40:30       sense in that sense. The dying people, they mean there's a, there's a lack of, uh, accepting of the futility of the body failing. But didn't they just pass assisted suicide in California like, or the ability to Jerry Brown just signed it. I mean, I think that's important too, because I think we put our dogs down. My dogs are sick and suffering. We know that they're 15 years old and there's no, there's no positive ending to this, but we don't do with people. We make people like naturally rot away. And I know there's this, there's a potential for fuckery and for people that want inheritance money and the you talk your elderly dad who's got Alzheimer's into signing over some will just before you fucking off him. There's a lot of that that's real. It's 100% I know a guy who found out that his own brother had talked his mom into signing a fucking new will and he had a fight him in court over it while it was mom's sick.

Speaker 2:          02:41:24       His mom was like, she's got some sort of a neurological disorder and she's completely out of it. And he, he did this while his mom was sick. He was taking care of his mom and he had to hurt. I mean it was fucking, as soon as it was horrible, horrible people out there that do, do things like that and they could do something like that and then put someone down. But on the other hand, like why would you want someone to just suffer in fucking complete and total agony for the remaining five months, six months, their life so that you can rest easy in the fact that they went out with God, they went out

Speaker 4:          02:41:56       naturally outweigh fighting. You know, after a long fight with like why is fighting so admirable? What, what happened to like gracefully accepting the fact that we're all mortal, especially. It's not like, well grandpa fought it and then he lived forever. He Won. He Won. He went back in time. Now he's 20 you know, Grandpa is getting younger every year. It's so strange. He just started competing in gymnastics, so it's amazing. He's going to stop shaving soon. What about, what about hermetically sealed stainless steel caskets? Oh yeah, that's what's up with that. Like what exactly is it that your ceiling out or in, I'm not sure what, which way the seals preserve him from nature. Well, wouldn't you want, I mean like this ashes to ashes,

Speaker 2:          02:42:44       dust to dust. Don't you want, don't you want them to be absorbed by the earth? Don't do it. The, the, they're the skin vessel to be useful and maybe a tree will grow underneath them or,

Speaker 4:          02:42:55       that's what I'm saying about American Cultured Dab, Duh. Right. Denial, anger, bargaining, depression, acceptance. Do you think the culture's stuck, but do you think that's changing, do you think? Do, and I think largely because this conversations like this, you know, I think largely because of people able to communicate

Speaker 2:          02:43:12       with each other and express how futile that is and ridiculous that is

Speaker 3:          02:43:16       because that's the kind of thing, if you know, if you're a parent or grandparent is or, or husband or wife is facing this kind of thing and you're, you're thinking, fuck, you know, I could put the dog down. I can't help my wife die in peace. Know you're not going to say that to anyone. You get arrested, you'll get ostracized. But we can say it publicly. You know, some people somewhere say is fuck it. This is the truth. Like in the book I quote from a doctor's and you look at how, what choices doctors make for themselves when they're dying. Oh. Versus what they recommend to their patients. Completely different. Yeah. I have access easy cause they know CPR rarely does anything. When you're 80 years old and you have a heart attack, say CPR, you know, might keep you pumping along for another couple of weeks, but you'll have brain damage, broken ribs and you know, excruciating pain.

Speaker 3:          02:44:11       A CPR works great. And movies, and actually I quote those stats on TV, the, you know, the number of people who go home and lead a healthy life after receiving CPR is like 95% and in reality it's like 6% yeah. So it's, it's a funny, so funny, but you know, getting back to the people you're saying who, you know, sign this and then often what are the question I have is like, are we, are we making there are creeps who will do that shit, right? There are situations that are really ugly, but by our refusal to openly talk about this stuff and make these things available, are we empowering them or not? Because the assumption is that they would have more power. But I think if you have an open adult conversation about these things in a government that acknowledges that sometimes the right thing to do is to help someone die without pain and the hospice gets funded a lot and all that. I think that this enables those people. It disempowers them because then grandma's getting, when she's still got her shit together, there's going to be more open about talking about it. There's going to be more advanced directive signed. People are going to be, you know, it's like sex where the abstinence only programs, those are the states where the most STDs are pregnancies, teen pregnancies. Right. So you refuse to talk about it. You just make it worse.

Speaker 2:          02:45:30       [inaudible] yeah, that it only makes sense in that sense. And I know that's a double, but I think that what's going on now that has never existed before is that our culture is not just being shaped by whatever media is projected. For the longest time, our culture was shaped by the people that surrounded us. You know? And that's why leaders were so important. Right. And the tribal cultures, tribal elders and Shamans and the people that had lived a long life and it learned and you could listen to them and they could explain these experiences that they've gone through and perhaps you're going to go through rites of passages were also very important for that same reason like you've got, you're going to go through something and experience something and then you'll have a greater understanding of the world because of that. And for the longest time in our, in our most recent history, you know, it's the longest time of, for us pretty recent, but the last few hundred years it was either a books that gave us a depiction of the world and we kind of learned from that and said, well this is obviously how the world goes.

Speaker 2:          02:46:26       Or then it became motion pictures and television and father knows best and you know, all these different shows that sort of gave us this idea or ideal of what life is all about. And that's where we've formed our vision or our version of reality. But now it's different. Like now our version of realities is informed by conversations. Our version of reality is being formed by people communicating with each other and it's just a completely different sort of experience because now you're seeing a broader, wider sort of conversation going on with whether or not this like it just even movements that are extreme like, like whether it's paid or whether it's a animal rights organizations or uh, uh, gay rights organizations or trans rights or whether these like these black lives matter or these other, there's all these different groups that have like way broader reach with activism.

Speaker 2:          02:47:26       That event, it was never possible before. Like if you didn't have a guy like Martin Luther King, a charismatic leader that could speak up and give speeches. I have a dream. Like if you didn't have that guy, who the fuck else do you have? So few voices. But now anyone with a concept or an idea that resonates with other people, you can make a tweet and that tweet can go viral and that viral tweak and shape the way people look at a certain subject. You could write a Facebook blog or a tumbler blog or make a short youtube video and people could watch that video and see your perspective. Go God. And he's right. Chris Ryan made a great point there and then they exchange it and they spread it. Send him money, send that motherfucker sub cash, pay pal, that dude's in cash. You know this, but this, this the unique time where we can all sort of, we can all aid and shaping our culture.

Speaker 2:          02:48:17       We can all aid in shaping our view of the world that we live in. That just wasn't available before. It just wasn't available. What are you going to mimeograph on? Million pamphlets and pass them out best you could become one of those people that shapes it for everybody else. Like you'd be counter circle. Well, even if you make a movie, you know, or if you make a write a book, but even then the movie is going to be censored by the money. Now you can make an independent movie with $20,000 in your fucking iPhone. Yeah, it's great. Yeah, you don't even, and then you could do it through a go fund me or a Kickstarter or some shit. You don't need anybody's help. I mean, we live in a weird, weird time. It's a, it's amazing, but I feel like we don't appreciate it or can't recognize how insanely transformative it is because we're a part of it.

Speaker 2:          02:49:04       I think like one day in the future, they'll look back at the 21st century and they'll look back, particularly at the time from, you know, the year 2000 I think maybe even 2001 maybe September 11th would be like a tipping point because of all the chaos that went along with that. And they'll look at the amount of change that's taking place in the last 14 years, since September 11 and they'll go, this fucking put this will, what a whirlwind of change and ideas and transformation. And in the middle of it, we're, we're just in the middle of it with our iPhones and you're fucking, you know, youtube and periscope and all this crazy shit is going on and we're not even realizing how bizarre it is. Well,

Speaker 4:          02:49:44       I mean, I don't know if you're, how you're younger than me, but I remember in 1992 I lived in San Francisco and I had a computer, a Compaq, and the Internet was starting and I was in graduate school and I had come from Spain to go to do graduate school in San Francisco and the Internet was starting and this graduate school, uh, didn't want to incorporate the Internet. They were like, Nah, that's it. You know, it's bullshit. Right. And I was like, if you guys would use this, I could go back to Spain, you know? Like, that was my idea. It's like this is going to be big, this internet thing. You know, you thought that even then that it would be like a global thing. I thought, I mean, I was thinking of it in terms of my own life, right? Because I'd wanted to be back in Spain.

Speaker 4:          02:50:29       I was living with a Spanish woman. She missed her family and like we were like Cha, you know, I want to get an American degree but I, I really like living in Spain and she wants to give it. And I was like, fuck, if I could like submit papers this way and the professors could answer through the Internet and we could like do this whole thing and I could be in Spain. And I remember getting really frustrated that they were just like, dad, this isn't, this isn't going to happen. That shows the difference between you and me. With me. When I first got on the Internet, it was 1994 all I did was download UFO reports, ca porn. I was looking for porn. I was like of report to. But it was frustrating because it was like click, click, click. Oh there's nice top of her breasts.

Speaker 4:          02:51:13       And I was single and living by myself. So I just would go to the DVD store, fucking rush those beads aside like a gangster and either rent them only room, sometimes they had saloon doors, the doors apart and go into that and everybody would be, would feel so guilty. And the porn section. Do you ever see a porn movie in a theater with like a bunch of old men and raincoat? No, no. I took my girlfriend in high school. Oh well, you know, they really cliche well boots. I told you I have this super hot Cuban girlfriend and my last year of high school and uh, we went to a dirty movie. I think it was Debbie does Dallas. Oh yeah. That's how old I am. And uh, yeah, I remember taking her in and I remember just like, it was like, you know, like taking a chunk, seal meat into a shark tank, you know, it's just like the dudes are just like, yeah, we'll want a live one. There it is. How cool did you ever see,

Speaker 2:          02:52:18       um, that when deep throat came out it was essentially viewed as a cinematic film. It wasn't like porn wasn't really a thing. There was stag films which were just like these weird weird clips on 16 million

Speaker 4:          02:52:31       meet early Jack Nicholson standing in line in Times Square. Johnny Carson, it was a famous photo of Johnny Carson and all these people dressed up really nice and they're waiting in line to go see deep throat. Have you seen the documentary inside deep? Thorough now? Yeah. Well another one. I'm expecting a report a Monday morning by the way, on the one with Lindsay Lohan, right. No incident. She chief away. It's a documentary about exactly what you're saying about the cultural moment that deep throat presented and how yeah. Uh, Lindsay Lohan play that role in a movie that very few people watched that happen. Um, Linda Lovelace. Yes. Yeah, yeah. Poor Linda Lovelace. Cause she then became a tool of the feminist movement. She did. Yeah, she, and then she claimed that she had been raped and that the whole thing, she didn't enjoy any of it. And then at the end of her life, I think she was diagnosed with cancer and that at the end of her life she was like, no, that was bullshit and all convinced me to say that. But really I was just having fun and it was talking a lot of dicks. No big deal. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          02:53:44       Well, you know,

Speaker 2:          02:53:45       oftentimes people do become tools of groups that have these, uh, ideological principles that you may or may not go with the idea of the feminist movement. And like th th the, the real problem that a lot of people have is that there's some women that are involved in that, that really don't like men and they're opposed to men and they're opposed to, there was one woman who was a part of, I think it's called Google ideas or something like that, but she had this a Twitter page and you know, she was arguing with people on Twitter. And one of the things she said is, I men for dinner or eight men for breakfast. Like, you think I'm scared, I eat men for breakfast. And everybody's like, what? What do you, why would you say that? Like all men, like not even assholes. Like why would you even say that?

Speaker 2:          02:54:26       Like you imagine if a man said that if a man in any position of power, like, and she was, I believe what, and I'm parenting poor understanding of what's going on. But I believe that she was brought in to sort of, um, uh, bring more diversity to this project they were doing, you know, this, this idea and that bringing a feminist perspective was going to, you know, balance things out a little bit, which is always a good idea. Right. But when you read something like that, like that's, if, even if that's not really her intention, just having that perspective, having the perspective of a, you know, I eat men for breakfast. Like you could never say I was a nice way, like come unwelcome.

Speaker 1:          02:55:05       I mean, hey, that's, that's not bad. I like women who have men for breakfast. Yeah. You know, blow job. There's the half asleep. Blow job is a beautiful thing. It's going away. It's like the Dodo bird. It's like the wooded owl. If we don't stop cutting down these trees and we're not talking about doesn't count because then you're not even there for, it takes a special kind of passion. And uh, I think, uh, some people just don't have that for each other. Well, and I think when you're half asleep you can sort of enjoy it more relaxed, more when you, you know, you're cuddling together and then someone just decides to start something. You're like, all right, we're doing this right. Ooh, well you do it. I'll just sort of lie here sometimes that's fun too. Yeah, sure, sure. I did not consent. Well, there's like a lot of madness now too, with sexy.

Speaker 1:          02:55:54       They want there, there were something they were handing out to, um, young students now where they were saying that you, you literally have to get consent. There were, there were saying that they should, you should get consent every 10 seconds during any, every, any sex act. I'm sure there's an APP, you know, Siri, ask her every 10 seconds, you know? Yeah. If she's enjoying, do you consent to this mass? Shove it in harder. May I go faster, you know, may I pull it back and then put it back in again, man. Now rub it on the outside. May I tease you man, we live in a world world. Yeah. Well, it's America to have you been to Spain? No, never. You got to come visit man. Well I think even it's not as suddenly if you think it's really America. I think it's what we were talking about earlier about these small groups of people that have these ideas and they're very, very passionate about spreading these ideas.

Speaker 1:          02:56:40       And these ideas don't necessarily have to be good, but they have to have a bunch of other crazy people that believe in them. Like the people that convinced Linda Lovelace in the saying that she was raped and you know, the feminist movement that co-opted her ideas. W I don't, I mean they didn't do it because they were calculating and evil and they had some grand plan to ruin it for everybody else. They probably did it because they were nuts. And there's a lot of other nutty people out there that agree with you. I tweeted something the other day that someone tweeted and it was so fucking ridiculous that it, it, it, it made me go, what the fuck? I don't even know what to say, but it was about abortion and the, uh, the tweet was something like, um, abortion isn't just about women because not everyone who gets pregnant is a woman.

Speaker 5:          02:57:30       Hmm.

Speaker 1:          02:57:32       I'm not sure I get that one because trans people can get pregnant. So a woman who identifies with being male can also get pregnant and abortion rights are for her to him him. Sorry, whatever. Yeah, I'll read you or read you the exact tweet because it's fucking maddening. It's fucking crazy. It just doesn't even make any sense. And to find it right here. You found a ready Jamie. Here it is right here. I found it right here. This is abortion.

Speaker 2:          02:58:02       Access isn't just a woman's right. Not all pregnant people or people who can get pregnant are women. What? In the fucking actual flux. But, but that's, you can get a bunch of people and go, yes, you're amazing. Which he did is beautiful. You just said was amazing. No, but you said it's horse shit like you just, we just because you think you're a man doesn't mean you're a man. Okay, we're off. We're off. On a weird tangent here, but that's, that's what's going on. Jermaine Greer got, and a lot of trouble for saying that. Do you know who she is? Yes. Yes. Correct. Yeah. The female unit she wrote. Yeah. So she said that she's like, look, you can call yourself whatever you want, but to me you're not a woman. Yeah. And everybody's like, wow, hate language. Languages are fucking opinion. Well, not only that, like God damn it.

Speaker 2:          02:58:49       Why? Why do we assume that when people say something nutty, that they're crazy and almost every single avenue except for gender, for gender would just accept anything. We'll just accept back and forth. There's a guy that they did speaking of radio lab, an amazing piece and the guy clearly out of his fucking mind when you listen to him talk, but he flips back and forth from being male and female all day long and they're talking about it like it's this very unusual thing. It's very rare. Normally with transgender they live in one sacs and believe there are another, but this person goes back and forth. But when you listen to this person talk you well, this is not a stable human being. Yeah, and it's quite possible they are out of their fucking mind. But you don't consider it because it's gender. If they thought they were a fox, if they believed that they were born in the ocean of Merck people, you would, you would say, well, this guy's out of his fucking mind.

Speaker 2:          02:59:46       But because he's talking about gender, he could say, well now I'm a man. Well now I'm, I'm a woman. I just turned. I just turned. So he's in the conversation and in the middle of the conversation he's like, I just flipped. Like they asked him something uncomfortable. I'm jack now. I just flipped like, oh, you're fucking crazy. Oh, you're crazy. You're crazy person. You believe your male and female back and forth like ping pong balls. Fuck you. Okay. Fuck you for putting this on the air. Fuck you for second. It's seriously, God dammit. We have time. Jamie's just tell we're out of time. Goddammit. Podcast in all the fucking smash three hours we did it again, sir. Knocked it out of the park. It tangentially speaking is available on iTunes. Uh, what's your website again? Chris Ryan. Chris Ryan, Ph d. Dot com. Yeah. Um, and the new book will be how long for? It's all edited and some whacked out next summer. Yeah. This summer coming up. Yeah. How many? 16 seven or eight months? Yeah. Yea. Yeah. All right. Hopefully before Trump becomes president, will you leave in December? We can fucking shove one more of these bitches. Sure. Dude, we could talk about it. I'll, I'll do my homework and we'll have lots to talk about. All right. Thanks brother. Appreciate it. As always fun. Yeah. All right, my friends, we'll be back soon and until then, go fuck yourself.

Speaker 6:          03:00:56       See Ya.

Speaker 5:          03:01:08       Yeah.
