Speaker 1:          00:00:01       Oh, an unusual early morning for me, an early morning episode of the podcast. Ethan, very nice to meet you, man. Thanks for doing this now. It's my pleasure. So drug policy alliance. How far are we away? Let's let's get this done. Come on. Well, it depends what it is, right when it comes to legalizing marijuana. I mean we got momentum that nobody could have believed we'd had just four or five years ago. Right. So in that sense things are flying. I don't think it's in the bag yet though, you know, I might. One of my biggest concerns is the sense of overconfidence where this whole thing could trip up. Yeah. My biggest, my biggest concern is that, and it's also like Jeb Bush and guys like that, like if those guys or that fat fuck from New Jersey Christy, can you believe the crapola coming out of his mouth on this stuff?

Speaker 1:          00:00:42       Somehow he's going to identify that niche of the Republican party that wants to keep locking up people for weed and that Rubio was saying stuff like that the other day. So I have a theory. Yeah, I have a theory. I think what he's trying to do is make sure he's never president and really do. I really think that that guy is so deeply in embedded in corruption in New Jersey that the moment he actually becomes a serious candidate for president, I think the shit is going to come out of the closet. Like a broken fire hydrant. Yeah, because I think also his popularity has fallen so low in New Jersey right now that he just wanted to get out of town. I think that's why he's running for president. It's better than dealing with stuff and trend and acknowledging all the screw ups he's had. I mean, I'll tell you something, that we lead drug policy alliance lead that effort to legalize medical marijuana in Jersey.

Speaker 1:          00:01:27       Back a few years ago, governor core resigned last billy sign was that one and then Christie came around. He did old and Donald and didn't want to do it. Wouldn't have rutgers university grow the weed. They didn't want to grow the weed. It was weird. And then finally he went on vacation like by 18 months, his term, he came back. He goes, I want to do this now, and I kept wondering whether you had a puff on vacation, who knows in New Jersey, still hobbling along. You know, Christie, the funny thing also is when it comes to ending the drug war more broadly, he's highly unpredictable. You know, we took on the bail bond industry, the private bill button, the trees, just trying to keep people locked up for as long as possible. Local jails and Christy liquored up coming on our side, you know, bond industry was working to make sure that people stayed in jail.

Speaker 1:          00:02:10       I gotta tell you, if you look at all the corrupt actors and the prison industrial complex, you know, you get to prison guards union, you get the private prison corporations to private bail bond industry. I mean if ever there was a sorted gang that had to be it. And so we led that effort. We got Christie to come along with us, push them back, you know, so Christie's done some decent stuff. He'll talk about addiction as a health issue. There was an issue, you know, people dying of overdoses and we wanted to deal with that. And he was initially vetoing it. Did we got Bon Jovi involved? He wanted to get a photo op, but by Jovi. So whose daughter had odd unfortunately lived. So he came along then. So he's been a mixed bag. But for some reason on this marijuana thing, he's just going over the top anti legalization.

Speaker 1:          00:02:51       I don't really get it. I think he's. I really honestly think that he's trying to make sure that he's never president. I really do. I think he understands the tide and I think he's terrified. I think he has a lot of skeletons in his closet. He's involved in New Jersey politics, New Jersey politics is so much more corrupt than New York politics, which is the most corrupt part of the country. Yeah. Although, you know, we're breaking some records in New York, you think just last six months. Both the head of the assembly and the head of the Senate have both been indicted, you know, so you know, it's neck and neck between us in Jersey. New Jersey's got that strong tradition history. I remember Christie made his name by being the federal prosecutor going after these guys. Then he gets himself involved in this bridge gate scandal, you know, with a guy on one side of the bridge, shut down traffic for two days because somebody had done something they didn't like.

Speaker 1:          00:03:40       So I think Christy had his moment back in 2012, 2011 when he was hot and riding high in the polls and his whole bullying act was going over. Well I think he's down in done with already just wants to be out of town. Well you can only shine like that as a bully for so long because if you're that guy that's yelling and screaming at everybody else and she's sticking your fat gut out there, eventually people start going, hey man, what about you? I mean, you know, the sad thing, that's the way Giuliani was, the only thing that saved his ass was 9:11, 9:11 comes along. Sudden he goes from being like 20 percent of the polls to 90 percent and he's the heroic mayor. But quite frankly people were burnt out on his act and it was only. And God forbid we do a crisis like that gives Kristi a second run.

Speaker 1:          00:04:19       Well, Giuliani was like the antidote for mayor Dinkins. Yeah, that's right. Dinkins was like this really calm, laid back guy and really racist people would call them. The janitor folks who weren't around back in the nineties in New York don't know that. First of all, time square was a completely different animal. Like you go to time square now it's this beautiful tourist trap. It's all neon lights and shining stars and I kind of missed the old time square. It was a CD, it was CD. It's now got overtop the other way, you know where it's like Disneyland on 42nd street. Imagine that though. If you could ever go back to New York City in 19 eighties and then see what times square was like and then come back again. You know what it is. I mean, because I live in New York City and so I live in the center of the universe in which you realize is that there's only so long in the center of the universe can go on without, you know, people reinvesting in it.

Speaker 1:          00:05:11       It's the island of Manhattan has got to be the most amazing island in the world and I'm, it's just glowing these days. What do you, what do you like about it? Well, first of all, I mean, I like being in this, you know, some people say it's a nice place to visit. I want to live someplace else. For me, I want to live in New York. I want to ride that energy and then as long as she can get out often, I mean the key is being able to get out of town and I'm out of town about half the time, so I get to go out, see the stars, see the ocean, you know, take hikes and then go back and write that energy. I love the fact that it's a pedestrian city. I don't own a car, right? I can walk to work, I can take the subway, you know, and then I want.

Speaker 1:          00:05:49       But this past weekend for the first time you, Californians and others might not appreciate this, but you're all over the place. I drove my bike from the upper west side of Manhattan down to Brighton Beach. About a 20 mile bike ride over the Brooklyn Bridge through Brooklyn, along the New York harbor. It was gorgeous. And the next day I took my bike up the Hudson river or to dikeman street. So there's great beauty there. Everything's there. I could, I could live my entire life and not go more than five blocks from my apartment. And everything's available. So the diversity of people live in there, you know, everybody comes through there. A and New York, New York's just a center. It's happened to you. It's perfect for you. It's perfect. Friendly. Jeff, my manager actually is a great friend of mine. Has been there forever and he couldn't imagine living anywhere else, but he also has a house on an island that he visits occasionally and he'll stay there for a week and just sort of like tell you know what, there's this place called fire island which spent an hour outside of New York.

Speaker 1:          00:06:46       Yeah. And so there's the fame, you know, the, the pines is the famous where all the gay community is. And then there's all the other little towns, uh, you know, and I been out there twice this summer. It reminds me almost of Venice. It's an island with no cars and take a one on my office is half a block from Penn station, jump on the train one hour than a half hour ferry and also in his gorgeous little island that's got no cars on it and you just relax. And the no cars things is what keeps people away. There's a lot of deer on that island. They used to be more, you know, now they're putting all this birth control stuff in the water for the theater. Isn't that hilarious? Yeah. You know, doing, you know, in the water shouldn't say the water because that would be good. Everybody.

Speaker 1:          00:07:25       But yeah, they had to deal with that solid thing there. What are they doing it for food or something? Leaving in something like that cost hundreds of thousands of dollars by the way. Is that right? Yeah, they're trying to do the same thing to the Hamptons is a real dear issue. And there was two options. One bringing hunters and they were going to hunt at night. Snipers. You reminded me there was a piece in the Wall Street Journal years, years ago, maybe decades ago. The Institute for Advanced Study is like what? It's this gorgeous place next door to Princeton University and it's where Albert Einstein was some of the greatest philosophers and scientists. It's where they go when they're in their older years and do their thinking, bucolic setting, and they were overwhelmed with deer. So the question was what to do? Well, you couldn't shoot them in this bucolic place, right? So what they do is they hired archers, professional archers to kill them with bows and arrows, and there was this uproar.

Speaker 1:          00:08:15       You know, this song, you know, all of a sudden, you know, they're with a philosophers. That bucks of deer bites the dust. But yeah. You know what way does it, you got to deal with that stuff. Well, it's food to these same people are eating cheeseburgers. They're eating Turkey sandwiches, they're eating dead animals that are killed in a way more horrific way and live in a way more horrific condition. I know I've always thought I have an obligation as an occasional mediator to actually see the process by which the food I eat is produced. I have to admit I've never made good on that commitment to myself. I just started doing it about three years ago. I started hunting three years ago and I'm addicted to it now. I love it. I get almost all my meat from hunting. I had bear last night. I served bear to my five year old and my seven year old.

Speaker 1:          00:08:56       Wow. So you know me, I grew up Jewish and closure. I'm still kosher. It's the one relevant, my traditional upbringing. And so traditionally Jews don't hunt, you know, although it's weird. You may choose from the south, you know, Jews who hunt. It's kind of a contradiction in terms of the Jews in the south that hunt. Oh my God. Yeah. You know, it's part of the culture, part of the tradition, you know, most of those Jews don't keep kosher so they don't care. So there's gotta be some and then you've got texted Jews. They're a special breed. They got to do it. He just text and Jews, they probably had a like Jews in Lebanon and we were talking about yesterday. Um, when you, when you say that your kosher, what exactly does that mean? Like you have to have a rabbi kill your beef and he is like say some Voodoo and then cut its throat more or less it, it's, you know, I mean basically it's this, you know, some of it's ground in the Bible, you know, in some clause that says, do not eat the meat of the calf and its mother's milk so you don't eat meat together with dairy.

Speaker 1:          00:09:48       And then they say you may meet, it's got to the animals. Got to have a split huff. Intuit's cut, right. Could be a cow. Actually, venison would be okay. Cow deer, sheep. Then it needs to be slaughtered in a special way, which for Millennia was the most humane way of killing that. It'll bleed, has to be absolute, perfectly sharp in the last couple of decades. There's now a dispute because in Europe they're beginning to band the kosher way of killing because it's no longer than most humane way according to the science. That takes more time if you ever seen it. I haven't thrown up rough. I've seen it. I went to a butcher not to a butcher rather to a slaughterhouse. Once we're kosher, kosher one, will they do kosher as well? Um, it, it was a slaughter house for fear factor, fear factor stunt there. And it was, the stunt was these people had a dunk their head in these giant buckets of blood.

Speaker 1:          00:10:37       So we had to have this cow's blood that was chilled to slightly over 32 degrees and we can only keep it for a short amount of time or could possibly contain pathogens. So it was really cold water or really cold blood rather. So they gave me like a little tour of the place and explain to me how they do it. And they have this area where the cow goes in, they locked the commonplace in a piston, goes through the cow's head and kills them. But they're like, you know, the guy was pretty adamant about and he's like, we have a rabbi that comes and they do the kosher slaughter and it goes in. It's way worse. Yeah. It's way worse. They hold the collar in place with the thing and then they slice it snack and it's it boxing exactly from Millennia. It was a more humane way because in the old days you just knock it over the head and all this stuff has been kosher way was if the blade was not razor sharp, if they had the tiniest nick in it and you discovered that afterward the animal is not kosher.

Speaker 1:          00:11:30       So there was a way of doing it that was supposedly better, you know. But you know, it is. It's the one true. I grew up, my dad was a rabbi, I grew up traditional and all that Sabbath observant and this is the one thing I'm still keeping. Its like why? Why do you keep it? It's partially my own sort of commitment, my Jewish connection and sort of daily reminder of that. It's partially a family thing, like a family, you know, we grew up this way and partly superstitious that this is part of my bargain with the cosmos, with my bargain, with God. You know, that, okay, I'm going to do this little sacrifice in my life and it's, you know, I've led a blessed life and uh, hey man, maybe this is part of it. Why risk advice stuff in it? The only way I can.

Speaker 1:          00:12:08       I've had, I've had some of the things by accident, like I've had hand by accident and probably a trip by accident. I've never had it intentionally. Don't think I've had bacon. Although when I eat in the diner, they got the bacon grease on the eggs. I get, you know, I love the smell of Bacon. I'll say that. You've never eaten it? No, because it's just, it's just this thing about bear big. And could you eat bear? Oh No, it's split huff too. It's good. That's it. But they don't have a split. Whoa. I have paused. That's something they need to split. Oh yeah. That's the thing. So. And the only exception is if you're starving to death and you can eat anything. Chickens find chicken that. Because that goes into the separate category of poultry. Oh, right. So you can't shoot birds, but you can eat that.

Speaker 1:          00:12:49       You can shoot them. Will not. I don't think so. I think it's also going to be slaughtered a certain way. So there's kosher chickens as oppose your chicken kosher duck. And you're living in New York. You got a lot of choices when you travel around. Mind you, the kosher industry, food industry is growing faster than the organic food industry proportionally really going to tell you. I mean, doing this thing here with you and uh, you know, in California you go to Manhattan Beach, now you go whatever, you got the, uh, the trader Joe's big kosher sections. And it's not just Jews, it's all sorts of other people who still see it as an effect. To some extent it is, it's more reliable, good quality. The highest ends not going to be kosher, but in terms of reliable, good stuff, you know, people say Kosher is a pretty good bet.

Speaker 1:          00:13:29       That's interesting. More than organic. I would never have imagined, it's not bigger than organic, but it's growing proportionately faster and that's partially because you have orthodox Jews are the fastest growing part of American Judaism, right? Liberal views like yeah, liberal Jews like me have one kid, I got one kid, two kids, right. Orthodox Jews are having, you know, five or 10 kids. So they're growing incredibly fast. Right. So they're a market and you have Jewish Orthodox Jewish communities that popping up all around the country. Manhattan beach out here in California. La has got a big orthodox community, you know, and then there are people on the African American people see it as basically, you know, they hear this kosher is better. And then remember the Muslim Halaal is very similar to similar rules. No pig. The slaughterings I think somewhat similar. So a lot of people out of Muslims by kosher food because for them all I know.

Speaker 1:          00:14:16       Is that something the Jews won't buy. Hello? In place a kosher. But I think Muslims, some Muslims will buy kosher because it meets the Heloc and the headline reads Muslims more tolerant than Jews. There you go. Here you go. Here and a half. There's that area around canter's Deli in La. Have you ever been to cancers? I don't think so. Oh, you got to go. Best Deli in all of La by far so good. The pastrami is off the charts. The Best Pastrami in La problems though with some of these delis. They used to be kosher. Now they're just kosher style. It's like they got the Pastrami and stuff like that, but it turns out because it's expensive to pay the rabbi to bless it and slaughtering, so I have to make sure it's actually strictly kosher. Wow. You really do did into that high, you know, it's been my thing.

Speaker 1:          00:14:59       I got to tell you, I've had more people, more friends and others rag on me than anything. And I say people say so would you ever stop? And I say the only way I'd ever stopped. I think you said if they made it a law that I had to keep kosher. If they made it a law, you had to keep kosher kosher that very next day. Well who would make it a law? Well, that's what I'm saying. It's not gonna happen in America, but I look what's going on in Israel where the religious parties are becoming more and more powerful and dominant and you go to Jerusalem and their frequency, or here's the rules on the Sabbath. Here's the rules on this. Here's the rules on that one can envision a generation from now that it Israel, you might have, you know, the religious folks driving everything and make a law like that.

Speaker 1:          00:15:34       If they did that and I'm still alive, I'll stop. So if they did that in Israel, you would stop in America. Probably just had a protest. Just that approach just because you want bacon. That's what's up man. You know what happens? I'll tell you the hard, the hardest thing you keep kosher. I've never had lobster and shrimp. I've never really had. The hardest stuff is when there's a beautiful steak or a beautiful piece of duck or a lamb out there and it's basically no different in the kosher stuff, but I can't eat it because they didn't pay the rabbi to bless it and they spoke differently. That's the one that hurts, right? People I to do. I got to tag onto what people. They say, Oh, do you mind if I order some pork or as a lobster? I say, please, whatever you do, don't order a beautiful lamb chop or steak or something like that.

Speaker 1:          00:16:15       That's actually going to torture me there. I'm eating my damn piece of fish for the eighth time that week and you know, it was a beautiful state that I can eat, so it's fish. Always Kosher. Is that the rule is if it comes from the sea, it's got to have fins and scales. Jesus Christ. So octopus is off the charts to you name it. All that stuff's all God have fins and scales. The shellfish is off and scallops and for that matter, things like shark and skate and even catfish is the one I cheat with a little bit and this is a debate about swordfish. I go with, I, I, I'm part of the school that says swordfish. It's kosher, but my dad was a rabbi. He came down that side. I'm going, my dad. Does your dad still alive though? Dialogue that I would have fucking had a lobster that moment.

Speaker 1:          00:16:54       That dude was in the. Oh yeah. Hey, he didn't even grow up keeping kosher. He loved rabbit. You know, he loved God. He became a rabbi. He had no choice. You know, it just seems so odd to me that a rational man like you, so obviously intelligent and educated would follow that. You know what's good about this? It gives me a sense of empathy for other people with their rational attachments. Attachments to drugs. Exactly, exactly. Or irrational attachments, anything. My view is irrational attachments are fine. Maybe even good so long as they don't hurt anybody else. My keeping kosher doesn't really hurt anybody else. Right. And there's all sorts of other attachments to religious things, to types of Gods, to habits, to name it. It's not hurting anybody else. I can kind of, you know, I got that little empathic sense for what it means to be irrationally committed to something. All right, man, look at you. You're looking at irrational thinking in a rational way to do that. You know, you got to be just totally rational. That'd be kind of boring too.

Speaker 2:          00:17:51       It was. So let's get back to drug legalization because we've got right now, we've got two states that are across the board. One hundred percent. We've got Washington state and we got Colorado. What's on the ballot right now?

Speaker 1:          00:18:02       Remember also Alaska and Oregon joined the group, uh, last November. So we have four states that are illegally there. And Oregon's can open up sales I think in a few months. And Alaska should open up sales. I can't remember the end of this year, beginning of next. So we've got four states that have legalized each one of them doing with 55 percent of the vote, typically getting more votes. And the guys who are running for governor, attorney general in those states got that. Those years, big dc did everything except legalized. They basically said you can grow your own, you can transfer it, but they're not, they haven't. They haven't set up formal sales yet because people worry that Congress will sort of put a hammer on them. Right. So you can't go to a store know those stores in DC. There's a little movement on Capitol Hill right now that might allow some room there.

Speaker 1:          00:18:48       But the guy, you know, the, the city council, the mayor in, in dc who are on board with legalization, but they're just saying, do we want to provoke congress because a lot of those guys would just come down hard, you know, they're used to treating dc like the plantation, right? If it's one of the great absurdities in American politics that you got a population of what, six, 700,000 people, I think it's as big as a few of the smaller states, but they got no representation on Capitol Hill. They got a member of the house who can vote. They got no members of the Senate, they can vote for president. Right. And then they got congress basically, you know, the ability to veto any law. They pass. So.

Speaker 2:          00:19:22       And they have an extremely fucked up situation as far as the haves and have nots in their own town.

Speaker 1:          00:19:28       They really do. Although there's a shift in the. I mean DC was recently like two thirds African American. Now as it's become more gentrified, it's still about 50 percent African American.

Speaker 2:          00:19:38       Well, the, the issue is not just the African Americans, the poverty, the poverty is in massive poverty and crime in certain sections of DC and the fact that that's the nation's capital. They can't even clean up their own backyard. Yeah, no, that's completely ignored it. When it was really highlighted when Marion Barry was president, and I should say as garden centers, Mayor

Speaker 1:          00:19:56       Mayor it, it's gotten better since those days and the sense that there's been more to address those issues has been some gentrification. Poverty is not as bad. They still got bad crime rates. It's not as bad as Baltimore's bid a bunch of Baltimore's one of the worst places in the country right now. Detroit, New Orleans. Although you've got a few places out here in California, I have a hard time. You. Oh, for sure.

Speaker 2:          00:20:16       CCS Weird in that you can go from really nice to really bad in a couple of blocks. I was shocked when I was driving through dc because I was like, this is crazy. You've seen these really a cute white couples with the little stroller and they're in these really nice brownstones and they have a Volvo parked in front of the house and right next to them as a bmw and then you go two blocks down and you see people drinking on the street and there's kids with no shoes on and is. It's garbage piled up. I was like, this is

Speaker 1:          00:20:48       really nuts. It could be partially about gentrification. Properties list expensive. So first typically gays will move in, right? Because they don't have kids to worry about and such. And then after that you get some young couples and others moving in and so you begin to get that. You saw the same thing in parts of New York City, upper east side or lower east side. Um, you know, it's when things begin to change that way that you get that kind of stuff. Wasn't that the big complaint about New York City's at so many rich financial people have moved in that the entire city is kind of used to be this artist community and there's now that's kind of Brooklyn now. The funny thing is now they're saying Brooklyn's moral becoming more like Manhattan and Queens is becoming the new Brooklyn and I got to say living in the upper west side where it's, I mean I'm lucky I'm in a rent stabilized apartment there, but, and I live in a beautiful tree lined street in a little apartment, uh, you know, but then you see the banks moving in and taking over the street corners, right?

Speaker 1:          00:21:39       And you see more chain stores coming in and so Manhattan has become this beautiful place, but less and less affordable now Brooklyn people, like most of the people work for me in New York living in Brooklyn, but now they got to move out to the further further away from Manhattan part of Brooklyn and Queens and the Bronx and Upper Manhattan are becoming the places, you know. I mean, look, the city's happen. It's great. It's amazing. The downside of our economic growth has been at the same thing with Wall Street. Wall Street is the, the gap between rich and poor in New York City is, is horrific and huge. On the other hand, Wall Street is providing massive amounts of tax revenue and New York City taxes itself at a very high level, so we actually have better services in New York City that most parts of the world. My friend Shane was living in Brooklyn and um, me and my family came to visit and we hung out with him one night and we had this apartment that overlooks the Manhattan skyline and we were looking at it and I was like, this might be the best looking view on the planet.

Speaker 1:          00:22:37       Like there's something about that. There's, there's like, I think there's two types of amazing views. There's amazing views of the mountains and nature, which is pretty stunning. But there's something about the Manhattan skyline that is so insane that someone built that. It's like, it's gorgeous because it's all lit up and the shapes are cool and then he has the history behind it and you're looking at all this activity and bustling people back and forth. And then there's also the magnitude of the amount of effort that was put into creating something like staring you in the face to face. Usually I'll be on a plane that's coming from north, from the north, say from Albany or Montreal or wherever it's coming from and it lands up going down the Hudson River. Right. And you know, Manhattan's basically a long island. It's like, I don't know, 15, 20 miles long and about a mile wide or sell and you look down at that thing and Manhattan and New York harbor and there's a statue of liberty and there you can see Staten Island and Brooklyn Jersey around it and then you see the empire state building and then you see the freedom tower.

Speaker 1:          00:23:38       You see central park in the middle of it, one of the largest, you know, inner city parks in the world. It brings tears to my eyes still. It's just incredible. Yeah, it was pretty awesome spot. But you can't get weed there. Well, what do you mean you can't get. You can get a weed anyway. You can get to talk to David Lee Roth. Got arrested. Trying to get weed there. You know, you've got to be either really unlucky or dumb. What kind of compress David Leroy Leroy passed. Are You sir? I got to tell you, I think our delivery services are very well developed in New York City, right? But they're always under the wire. Like that was always the problem that I have in la. Before it was legal. I used to deal with this dude named Jake the snake. That was his nickname. I'm not kidding. And he wasn't a wrestler.

Speaker 1:          00:24:19       Jake, the snake was so annoying. He was so annoying and he, uh, he would sell a W. I would get it from my friend Eddie and Eddie would get it from jake the snake, and we would have to deal with this guy. So this is like we'd have these conversations with this guy and now and then, you know, and it's like. And I always felt like it wasn't a bad guy, wasn't he was a bad guy, but it was annoying that you had to deal with this dude who was willing to do something illegal because like there was some criminal aspects to it. There's always going to be like. And I got to say I'm lucky because one of the perks of my job is I can just rely on the kindness of strangers. I mean forever I go, people are going to euthanasia and want to try a little bit.

Speaker 1:          00:24:54       Hey, they got this one is, it's hard to take it home with me. Right. But even in New York, people are kind of. So I haven't had to buy weed and a very long time. I'm happy to say good for you. Yeah. Yeah. Now you saw that, uh, my job has got some very nice elements to it and this is one of the informal positive benefits to it, you know, but New York is now they finally the state just approve 20 outlets for medical marijuana. So most of those are going to be in the city. It's still going to be very strict system. We led that effort in New York last year to legalize medical marijuana. Unfortunately, governor Cuomo acted in total bad faith and made a system that is far, far too tight, a no logical reason for it. But that said they just, the state just approve five companies to have five gross sites with 20 I outlets.

Speaker 1:          00:25:40       So we're locking down the profit aspect of it. They are. I mean my God, it's going to be a boondoggle for these five. You know, that God, it's so fucked up. Why do that? That doesn't make any sense. Is that the case for tomatoes? Is that the case for any other piece of produce? Anything grown from the earth? What about lettuce can buy lead us anywhere. I imagine if there was a company in New York that locked down the lettuce market and the only way you can get a salad from this one fucking company. Yeah. No I agree with you totally. Just kind of hear what's going on at Ohio. Right? And Ohio is going to have a kit to vote to legalize marijuana in this year. Twenty 15. The only initiative on the ballot this year as opposed to next year is from Ohio when I was in the papers today.

Speaker 1:          00:26:18       Because the initiative just qualified yesterday. Right. And what they found that when we basically what happened there was 10. I think it was roughly 10 business interests got together, right? To put an initiative on the ballot. They each ponied up like over $2,000,000 a piece. Right? We asked for our help in drafting it and we said we help them draft it to get some good stuff in there, but the one thing they did that nobody likes is they put into the initiative that only the 10 investors are technically the properties they own will be allowed to produce marijuana wholesale in Ohio in perpetuity. Right. It's like you always say, this is an agricultural product. We're going to have a constitutionally mandated oligopoly. We're only 10 properties can grow for the state forever and ever, and so I'm profoundly toward because that oligopoly model in the constitution sucks and we're talking about this yesterday.

Speaker 1:          00:27:10       Yeah, it's bullshit. It's bullshit and you should pass on it and just get weed illegally. That's what I say, fuck those people because what they're trying to do is they're trying to take something that's good and profit off of it in a way that only they can profit off of it and lock everybody out and they think they're being sneaky. They can go fuck themselves. Well, I'm torn because on the other hand, if this thing winds this year, Ohio is a major swing state in American politics, 2016, all the candidates are going to be vine and Ohio. Meanwhile, the thing will only be in theory because it will not have been implemented and there's all sorts of people trying to block the oligopoly provision, so what an Ohio when this oligopoly provision, if it all works out well, this thing winds opens up. The national discussion forces.

Speaker 1:          00:27:53       The candidates talk about this issue, puts it in Ohio in a major way. Meanwhile, everybody's so revolted by the oligopoly model. You already had the state legislature trying to knock it out with a competitive initiative. The thing is going to land up in the courts anyway. I don't see any of the other states adopting this model. I mean, none of the other initiatives on the ballot in 2016 had this oligopoly provision in it. I think the sense of revulsion as kind of doing that sort of thing. So my sense is if it all works out well, initiative winds, the oligopoly thing never gets implemented. That's why you're here. Anything we need to hear this. This is beautiful. We need to hear this kind of stuff now. Do you face any pressure at all? Um, to not talk about the fact that you smoke weed yourself being the fact that you're a part of the drug policy alliance and you have to have put ties on and meet with some serious folks.

Speaker 1:          00:28:41       You know, it's been an evolution Joe, because I would say when I really got going in this in the late eighties, I was very careful about that because that was the height of the drug war. Right? And, and, and I that my dissertation research, I wrote my Phd at Harvard and it was on the internationalization of criminal law enforcement, which is three years earlier. I had had a security clearance. I'd worked in the State Department's Narcotics Bureau. I'd wrote a classified report on drug trafficking, money laundering. I traveled all around South America and Europe interviewing dea guys and foreign drug enforcement guys. I'd written a dissertation and the book an international drug controls will cops across borders, so I just knew these guys and they and they had opened their doors to me and now three years later I'm out there saying we got to talk about legalization and at that point when the drug war was like, mccarthyism on steroids, right?

Speaker 1:          00:29:28       It was just so. I was very discreet. I never would deny that I had smoked marijuana, but I would never talk about being occurring consumer. And then as things began to ease up into the late nineties, early two thousands, I began to be a little looser with it, but I still would say go to the cannabis cups would invite me and I maybe showed up at the hemp fest in Seattle a couple of times, but I'd still be careful now. The Times are changing. Right. And it's a lot like the evolution with gay people in America, right at the points at which different people would feel comfortable coming out and all this sort of stuff. And so now I'm quite comfortable saying, yeah, you know, I smoke weed. I had been occasional consumers since I was 18. It's been a net positive in my life, you know, and I actually even a few years ago on psychedelics it, you know, we do this big biennial conference on and a few years ago it was in la, um, and I, and I said, this was kind today, did it.

Speaker 1:          00:30:19       I said, you know, I'm Jewish, right? And so once a year I fast on Yom Kippor, 25 hours, no food, no water. I think it's good for the soul to fit to a fast once a year. I'd say that's the way I view doing psychedelics as well. You know, that people should keep doing psychedelics at least once a year, well into their elder, elderly years because it's a good way to stir up the emotional sediment in intellectual sediment and stay honest as you grow older. And so I think, you know, I felt coming out about that as well. I think the times, you know, we're, we're in a day and age in America right now where we can talk about this and need to talk about it more openly. And what is your second dog of choice that you like to do annually? Well, mushrooms is sort of the standard.

Speaker 1:          00:31:00       I mean that's one just over Christmas vacation, you know, I just did a sort of mega dose and it was, it was really clarifying how many grams is a mega dose, you know, from a quarter ounce, you know, six, seven grams of dried. My son's. Yeah. Yeah. No, you don't want to fucking hear. You don't want to be around it. Sasha, Sasha Shogun used to call me a hard head, you know, it's like by which he meant, you know, I need it. I need a big dose to Iowasca done a few times, both in once in a Santa dime ceremony in one sit. A just a more laid back way. And that was really amazing. You know, Lsd, that one. I mean, I, you know, I've enjoyed it. I've never done a megadose with that. Uh, you know, I think it's a, but it's not resonate with me the way mushrooms.

Speaker 1:          00:31:40       Have you ever do dmt? No. Well, um, well, sort of, you've done Iowasca. You've had a milder version of it. I mean, there was one time somebody had made up, a guy knows a good scientist had done a, made up a, a thing that was a combination of dmt and ketamine and Ah, you know, that was a, that was. No, no, no. He was actually, he was an interesting, interesting guy and he did it and found that he had found that he was dealing with significant depression and he found that this Combo actually lifted his baseline depression. And now there's all this research about ketamine being fairly effective as an antidepressant.

Speaker 2:          00:32:22       We've actually had a friend on Neal Brennan who talked about it. He's a good friend of mine who's a stand up comedian. He was a, the cocreator of the Chappelle show. Very funny guy and put his head like some troubles in his life and went through legal in Los Angeles, went through legal ketamine treatments, depression,

Speaker 3:          00:32:40       and he goes, he wasn't exactly sure what that was going to be like. So he sits down, they do it intravenously, right? So he sits down in this doctor's office and they will walk him out and he goes, dude, I'm on a 45 minute journey through the university. Goes in. It's like the strongest fucking trip I've ever been on an I can't believe I'm doing this in a doctor's office. So I gotta ask you, I was reading your bio before and I saw that you have an isolation tank. Yeah, use it. Have you ever read John Lilly's? Sure. Scientists I've read that I read, uh, the deep self have read a couple of us. I remember reading that book and fishes that itinerary science. And for your listeners who don't know, right? John Lilly was the great, you know, Pioneer state teaching communications, communications with whales and dolphins, dolphins and all that.

Speaker 3:          00:33:20       And also the person who may have invented the isolate he did did. And he goes through this period in his life where he starts injecting ketamine every hour on the hour. It is isolation tank like 12 to 18 hours a day, almost kills himself in the end lives to be like in his mid eighties. Um, and that's the way in which he ventured into trying to figure out what the world is all about. My friend Todd Mccormick did deep has his tank. He owns his tank and he did ketamine in that tank with lily. Is that tied to that? Yeah. Todd Todd did ketamine like, like he was about to do the tank and lily asked some, do you want ketamine or. No, and he's like, when John Lilly asked you if you want to do ketamine before you get into his tank, you say yes. So he whacks him with the ketamine.

Speaker 3:          00:34:06       He goes under and apparently he was like screaming or something while he was in there because he's out of his fucking mind first of all, because the tank by itself is a psychedelic experience and shut the door as long. I mean, you're, you're, you're more aware and you can shut it off at any time. It's more of a conscious decision to enter into the psychedelic state, but when you add that to the academy and apparently it's just this unbelievable journey through the mind and todd was just not prepared for it. So Lily, we had another tank next to his other tank, gets in the second tank, wax himself out and visits him, goes and visits him in the fucking ketamine dimension while they're both in a side by side parallel isolation tanks. Like that's something to tell your grandchildren about. Kid about won the world series.

Speaker 3:          00:34:55       So you've done Ella psychedelics in your isolation tank. I've only done mushrooms and edible weed in the isolation tank. The edible weed is my favorite. The high doses of edible weed is one of the most underrated psychedelics today. There's a lot of people that don't understand that if you get a really high dose like a, and it doesn't even have to be a big thing. That's the thing. What they're doing today with these concentrates and Hash oils, they have these fucking gummy bears, man, gummy bears that are 250. Some of them like what does achievement? She was 500 milligrams. They have 500 milligram thc Chiba Chews. If you eat one of those and get into the isolation tank, you will go on a journey that I liken

Speaker 1:          00:35:38       to any DMT trip, any mushroom trip, but the vedic texts, a lot of the Hindu scriptures, they were all written by people who are eating hash. Like a lot of the really crazy visuals and the Buddha and all that stuff. You see that shit when you eat it. Is there any jokes? I tell you for me, I mostly associate the high dose edible with just being knocked on my butt and just like, you know, didn't go high enough. Yeah. Well that could be it because there had been some good experiences and not quite. I know what you're talking about, but I haven't gone to that level with it. I've only gone a couple times by accident. You know, the, the, the real accidental ones in places where I didn't know that I was going to do it. I've had some terrible journeys on planes were like right before, like I'm like, I don't like flying.

Speaker 1:          00:36:20       It's annoying. I got to do it too often so I'll take something like right when I pull up to the airport, I don't want to have anything on me when I'm going through security. Right. So I'll eat like a cookie or something right before I go. And then like as you know, the bags are going through and then I go to starbucks, get a cup of coffee, then I sit down at the gate and I'm like, Oh fuck, I might've taken too much and then give the ticket, get on the plane. And then once I sit down I'm like, okay, at least I know I'm going to be here for the next six hours. And then the universe dissolves. And you could shot through some worm hole to the center of your mind and you reexamined your childhood and like, fuck, I don't mean I gotTa tell you I've done that.

Speaker 1:          00:36:57       Edibles and planes a few times, one time to somebody, like you said, don't want to count a plane. Had a little nibble before Chicago to Laguardia. I landed all my God, please somebody get me home here. You know, on the other hand, at the time thing of finding yourself on thinking, God, this stuff knocked me all the time. Why don't I just do little edible instead of a sleeping pill because I don't like some of the sleep people effects. It didn't work. It was kind of fidgety and it was closed and you know, so I've stayed away from the edibles on the planes. They're very tricky because you, you really have to be in the right state of mind and you really have to treat them with respect. I think edibles have always been associated with silliness and I think that's the trick that they've played on us.

Speaker 1:          00:37:37       Like have a little pot, Brownie man will be, we'll get crazy. I know it's not silly. It's serious business and the fact that. I mean, it's funny because now with all the concerns about edibles that, you know, somebody asked me the other day, what's the thing that most surprised me about the evolution, this whole marijuana reform thing last five, 10 years and it's been the emergence of the edibles. It. If you had asked me five, 10 years ago, I would not have anticipated that edibles and drinks and all those. We playing such a major role in legal marijuana. Oh yeah. Well they're paper pens to vape pens, but at least those are the vape pens I might've seen because of the antismoking stuff coming in and the e-cigarettes coming along, but the edible stuff and the gummy bears and the chocolates and all this sort of stuff, breath strips. If you had one of those now don't very a full one. Is that right? Yeah. You got to break them up. Yeah. You gotta break them up drunk. Me and Tommy. Shakira was a good friend. Mine stand up. Comedian. We tore one in half and ate it on a plane. We're doing some gigs in Florida, popped it on the way to a. It was a nighttime flight, a Redeye,

Speaker 3:          00:38:36       and we landed and we both turned and looked at each other and go. We were like, how terrifying was that? Fucking terrifying. What was in that like? I. Well, I got to tell you much stealing from this. From a policy perspective. I mean, we're doing everything we can to have some responsible regulation in this area. You need better testing. You need to know that if you're buying a cookie, that stuff's going to be evenly distributed. Find a chocolate bar, distributed people got to figure out their dose. You know, I found for me, like right now I know about seven milligrams. It's just kind of a nice cat. Seven relatively low dose. That's really hard to find. Usually the lowest 20 though. Well, what I'll do is I'll get a candy bar that's broke it up into bits of 10. It'll split it a little more than half or something like that.

Speaker 3:          00:39:15       So that's like a calm, mellow, calm, nice to kick back, relax. Maybe go for a swim, go for a massage, maybe go to movie. I mean it's that level, right? And the higher level can be good too, but it's got the risk of knocking me on my ass to higher level to me is like this, it's a potential like a, like a treasure hunt. Maybe treasure hunt for ideas or an exploration of maybe there's something I missed, you know, maybe like because I'm always trying to like dig down into my psyche and find out what I don't like about me or what I need to improve or what I need to work on more what, what, what aspect of my career, my life I need to be putting more attention to. And usually the pot sort of lets me know about that in the pot, in the tank.

Speaker 3:          00:40:01       That's my big exploratory journey. They eat a cookie getting the tank and then get out and go. I gotta go to work. It's interesting for me. Pot sometimes does that, but it's unpredictable when it's going to work that way, you know? And then I grabbed the opportunity. I may be sitting at a concert and had an edible or smoke and all sudden like my brides fly and stuff down, you know, listen to music. But, but for me, the thing about the mushrooms, which I don't like to do it is when you get older it takes more of a toll. You don't recruit, you know, like I do mushrooms and the next day it's like I'm, I'm burnt out. Really? Oh yeah. Yeah. Now that wasn't true when I was in my twenties, early thirties about my fifties. Now you know, did you ever try five htp and when you come back from it, I was just talking about that this morning.

Speaker 3:          00:40:42       I don't think I have tried that. That's a big one because for mushrooms are in DMA. Well for either one but much more so for Mtma then for mushrooms because that's a direct effect. That's exactly what it's doing. But mushrooms as a toll on it as well. And a lot of people that have done the heavy mushroom trips have found success in taking um, l, Tryptophan and five htp afterwards. L trip to fan actually converts to five htp and five htp convert to Serotonin can get those over the counter. Yeah. Yeah. We actually sell. So I'll get you some. Do we have any new mood here? Do we have in that? So we have some. We get you some. Yeah, yeah. This is it right here. Yeah. Oh No, no, this is. Thank you. Yeah. That's a combination of five htp trip to fan and all that stuff does is it gives your brain the building blocks to produce human neurotransmitters. That's what it does. It keeps you being the building blocks and that stuff to

Speaker 1:          00:41:34       produce serotonin. I have to say, well, what am I great regrets? Is that the, you know, first did it I guess in the early nineties when I was in my early thirties and, and I loved it, you know, and did it both for going to occasional rave or be with my wife at the time or friends. But I have to say now it just doesn't seem to work for me as well anymore. That's a downside. Begins to exceed the upside. And it's a bummer. I've only done it once and the downside was so strong. The upside was amazing. It was an I, Amanda done too much. I took two tabs and um, uh, the, the, the experience was beautiful and it taught me so much about insecurity, so much about like the way I behave in the way people behave and interact with each other.

Speaker 1:          00:42:16       How much of it just based on insecurity, you know, it was weird like, ah, this sounds gay as fuck, but this is exactly what happened. Me and this dude, we're on a couch. We were holding hands and we're talking about how good it feels to just hold hands. And we weren't scared to like, hold hands was another dude. It was totally nonsexual. It's so funny because I remember one time we have a close friend and some of these friends are like leading academics and drug policy, drug studies. I mean major figures and we'd become good friends and we would occasionally get together and do you know, do it Mtma thing like once a year. And I just remember one of my friends who's distinguished professor him, just four of us were sitting on the couch and he just laid down on top of our days and we all just put our heads out of.

Speaker 1:          00:42:59       And it was so loving, so wonderful. So I know you're talking about nonsexual. It's a weird thing. The MTMA apparently they say I've never tried. Not only did it once, but people say that it's really hard to have sex when you're on it. Right. Well, the thing is with the goal, it's not the sex drug. It's a hug. Yeah. Right. I mean that's the thing and it's, it's something you can't get aroused on it, but it's, you know, at some point the I, that's been my experience. You can get aroused. They're all that sort of stuff. But at some point the energy is shifting towards more hug energy, loving energy, you know. Whereas for example, psychedelics and sometimes and go into a highly sexual direct. Well that was the argument that Mckenna had for mushrooms being the catalyst for human evolution. Do you ever, you know, about all that?

Speaker 1:          00:43:40       Do you know Mckenna's? Yeah, yeah, yeah. I mean I kinda liked the theory, the notion of hunter gatherers and hunter gatherers who consumed silicide mushrooms or whatever. We're the ones who are going to be better at whether it was warfare thing or a whole range of other things, so it's intriguing and terrence was a remarkable speaker who's the best speaker who was so fascinating technique. I only met him a few times, but one of the last times he called me up because I think you were supposed to speak at Ucla or USC and at the last moment they were gonna prohibit him from speaking or whoever was loaning them the hall or something like that, and so he just called me up and I called the local Acu and I got on it and we solved the problem. Wow, that's great. That's beautiful. As you lead to one of the speeches.

Speaker 1:          00:44:23       I think so, yeah. And his brother, Dennis Mckenna, he and I were both at the first World Iowasca Congress need Biesa last October, and that was something. I mean, here you have it. It was either it was an ebc because he beats his right. The party island and Iowasca is not a party drug. It's a serious thing, but there were about a thousand people in this conference will not be, so you had leading academic scientists like Dennis Mckenna, you had shamans both new age Sharmans in traditional shamans from La, from Latin America. You had people who were. There was a guy, Polish guy who would do an occasional iowasca ceremony where he would invite musicians who would then make music together and the influence of Ayahuasca, and then I was invited because the organizers wanted to know how does Iowasca connect to broader drug policy reform, so that was quite a gathering. Dennis is amazing.

Speaker 1:          00:45:09       I love that guy. I've had him on a few times now and had some beautiful conversations with them. It's just I'm always like, I can't believe I'm sitting here talking to Dennis Mckenna. He's. He's psychedelic royalty. Yeah, yeah. No, now he really is. And the stuff. You know, it's funny. I've never gone on one of those Iowasca tours down in south. Have you done that? Nina did. Occasionally. What? I hate bugs apparently Dennis does too, so he does them in a different part of Peru. It's not. It's a dry climate. It's not a moist jungle climate. He's like, you don't have to go to the jungle. And I'm like, yeah, well I go to the jungles fucking mosquitoes man, get eaten alive. But for some people it's like part of the beauty of the journey, it's like the suffering of dealing with the bugs and the like.

Speaker 1:          00:45:50       My friend amber got bit on the leg by a spider and our whole fucking leg turned black. Like a black and blue brothers. Giant Qj yes. So people do these things out in the forest and they, you know, they start walking off in the middle of ceremony. Nobody ever finds them again, but Jaguars. Yeah. No, I was perfectly happy to do my first IOWASCA experience in Santa Barbara, California. That's perfect. Yeah. No bugs, no bugs. Just rich people. Yeah. Yeah, exactly. Exactly. The only thing that hard is the plastic surgery around you. That's true. But I'll tell you the Iowaska think too. It reminds me when you read about the the emergence of LSD and Mescaline in the fifties and the guys who went around dosing people, cary grant, famous actors, politician cary grant used to dos para. Not He didn't those people, but he became an enthusiast.

Speaker 1:          00:46:36       Who's that famous, who's. She was a famous female swimmer who then was in movies. I forget her name, but you know you had famous people doing it, life magazine writing about it and I think Iowasca is almost a bigger version of that right now. You're having IOWASCA ceremony is happening all around the world, not just the US or North America and South America, but in Europe, Asia. I mean it's extraordinary and so many people describing profound and transformative experiences and it's not totally without risk, but the benefit risk ratio is so enormous. What is the risk though? Well, I no physical risk. The risk, the risk is only psychological and if you are psychologically unstable person, you really shouldn't be doing anything to perturb your consciousness. If you have issues with psychosis or bipolar or you know, there's a lot of people that have. The other thing with powerful psychedelics is if you have a cardiovascular risk because you're, you're, you're so stimulated,

Speaker 4:          00:47:30       so stimulated and then the thing is because Iowasca, you know, every shaman makes the batch of different ways so you're not exactly sure what's in that stuff. And then there's thing about making sure the person's safe while they're under the influence, you know, it's like the horrible story. What happened with that guy in Colorado with the edible, right? Who had never done it before and he jumps off the balcony or the horrible stories about people doing lsd and thinking they can fly. So, you know, Bill Hooks joke on that. Yeah, Bill Hooks. What a tragedy. Someone jumped out, he goes, what an idiot because we thought it could fly. What did he take off from the ground first? This whole bit about it, about a young man on acid is a, a bit about a positive drug story. And his thing was like all the media ever tells you about is these negative drug stories by the guy jumped off the roof.

Speaker 4:          00:48:14       Well, I mean it's part of it. As marijuana is becoming more legalized in our society and hopefully around the world and as we move forward in the psychedelics to begin to open them up as well and maybe not too old to new psychoactive substances and some of the synthetics which may have some upsides to them, but the key is going to be putting out a door and out there about what it means to use safe. I mean, for example, get doing mushrooms, real estate and going to a concert with 50,000 people around or 10 times people around. Generally not a good idea unless they're also on LSD and you know them all. That's true. That's true. That might work. Okay. But maybe. But that's a scary thing. It's like people think, oh, let's go do this as a party drug and all of a sudden all sorts of information overload and losing perspective and all this sort of stuff and people that are always going on or do you see going to burning man?

Speaker 4:          00:49:03       Right. And I remember meeting a guy who'd done some weird drug and and he had just totally flipped out. He thought an animal is trying to eat him alive, right? While he was flipping out, and fortunately, you know, Rick Doblin, the guys had maps and set up these kinds of, you know, safety zones and so they were able to get this guy away from the cops because the cops are going to shackle him, put them on a helicopter and take them to a jail which could have been horrible and instead they gave them to rick and rick is able to talk this guy down and you know, do it. But we have to be weird that when, when people are taking these powerful mind altering substances which can have these wonderful things as you and I have experience, we got to be aware that there are people who are not as stable as they think they are.

Speaker 4:          00:49:41       People who have deep seeded shit going on and they don't know what's buried that's going to come flying out people or don't understand that yet. If you're going to jump jump from the first floor, not the fifth floor. So we got to make sure because the jump from the first floor, the ground floor, the ground, exactly, you know, but that it's going to be so key because I mean, look, just to shift away from the silos for a second, one of the issues we're working on big time is trying to reduce the number of people dying from overdoses involving either heroin or pharmaceutical opiates. So last couple of years, more people have died of an accidental overdose involving heroin or other pharmaceuticals than in a car accident. It's the number one cause of accidental death in America today. I mean, it's absolutely crazy stuff. Right? And in fact, when we say overdoses suggests you took too much.

Speaker 4:          00:50:27       Most of what our overdoses or drug combinations, they're typically doing this opiate, your pharmaceutical, opiate, oxycodone, whatever it might be. It might even be prescribed to you with booze or with Benzos, valium type drugs. Right? So what we're trying to do is to put out there the notion that don't care if you do it. Opiates, don't combine it with booze. Don't combine it with tranquilizers. There's a miracle drug called Naloxone and we're trying to make that stuff as widely available, reverses the, it's like an antidote for an overdose. Make it available. We're passing nine slash 11 good Samaritan laws. So if people are around and a buddy there's overdoses, they don't just flip out, they call nine slash 11 right away, the way with a heart attack. So, you know, it's true with the psychedelics and marijuana, but even with the drugs that we see as less elevated in a way, but that huge numbers of people are using life, the opiates, it's really important that we become more and more of a society that understands the notion that we need to make it safer to use these drugs. Right? We got to keep people from getting hurt the way that

Speaker 2:          00:51:24       people get hurt. But we had a guy on here yesterday, um, uh, his two guys, Chris and Mark Bell, uh, who, uh, they were a part of a documentary called bigger, stronger, faster, which was about steroids. And now they have a new one called prescription thugs. And it's all about, uh, the, the opiate pill industry and how many people die from it and how many people are addicted to it and the numbers. I wasn't prepared for the numbers when we had the. And we started exploring the numbers. They were talking about this from 2010. There was eight point 7 million people abusing these pills on, on a daily basis in this country. I mean, that's a staggering.

Speaker 4:          00:52:02       Well, I mean, nobody really knows the number, right, because what it means to abuse it and whether it is abuse, but it, you know, 20 years ago you had a massive problem of the undertreatment of pain, right? That people were so flipped out about using opioids, had people who were terminally ill, children who are terrible burn victims, people going through a traumatic, you know, post operative recovery from surgery and stuff like that. We're not having their pain treated. And the failure to treat pain appropriately can shorten people's lives, lead to major depression, lead to other drug taking and all that sort of stuff. So over the nineties, early two thousands, we began to solve that problem. So now it's opiates are used much more correctly, but then what happened is that we, we really have in America is an epidemic of chronic pain, right? Lower back pain, Sciatica, chronic fatigue, fibromyalgia, carpal tunnel, I mean the tens of millions of Americans may be close to 50 or 100 million Americans go through some chronic pain episode during the course of every year or two, whatever it might be.

Speaker 4:          00:53:05       And it turns out that for many people going through dealing with chronic pain, opioids don't work that well, right? They just don't work. They're appropriate for sort of severe pain and they're appropriate for some chronic pain patients. So what happens is people start taking this stuff, they have chronic pain and they're taking opioids and the doctor's given the opioids and then they're building up tolerance. So they're taking higher doses which is building the risk, right? And then maybe they're combining it with like a value type drug to reduce their anxiety, or maybe they're taking alcohol because that makes him feel better. And then what happens is at some point your heart, your breathing stops, right? And so what we need to do with that, that overprescription of these opioids, it's not just by physicians who are criminals and are doing these things for money. It's not just black mount market marketeering. It is stuff. It's also a lot of people just trying to help doc good meaning doctors trying to help people who are suffering with pain, by giving them the opioids they think they want and need. When it turns out, that's probably not the best way to deal with it.

Speaker 2:          00:54:05       Well, there's an issue that people have with pain that comes from work, from sitting down all day. There's an issue that people have from not taking their body as important or as taking the health of their body as significantly as they should. I think that there's a lot of people that just don't. They don't know the consequences of sitting at a desk with bad posture all the time. Like these chairs that you're sitting in. These things are special ergonomic chairs that make you kind of support your body weight up straight. They're called Pisco chairs or this company called Ergo Depo, but before I got. These are sat in regular office chairs at the end of every episode, out of my fucking back, the middle of my back killing me, and this eliminated them. Ergonomic chairs are very important. Sometimes people like to sit on those balance balls. That's important, but what's also important is taking care of your health and fitness, taking care of your body, like yoga. If more people did yoga, the you would have way less back pain, less joint pain, way less stress, but they don't have the time or if they do have the time they choose to have do that. Time to go get drunk. What you like. That

Speaker 4:          00:55:15       me and I've had more people tell me to take a yoga than any other piece of advice in my entire life and I just can't get into it. Have you tried it? Tried it many times, you know, and I just, I just know that you know, I'm sitting. You know what I realized. I'm in your beautiful Ergonomic chair here, Joe, but I'm slouching. So now I'm going to sit up straight. Let me readjust the mic here. You know, and then I'll feel better. I'll breathe better, you know, it's like I gotta tell you something.

Speaker 2:          00:55:36       What do you mean by you can't get into it? I just don't enjoy it. You're not supposed to enjoy it the way I will say an hour and a half of suck. But you know, other parts of life suck quite all I do that, you know, I wouldn't say the ideas that there's a benefit for that suck. What are the things I love about weed is I love to stretch. When I do, we get into my body, you know,

Speaker 4:          00:55:58       and that's the thing. It's just whether it's swimming, but the only time I like feeling that, you know, stretching my I hate, hates trish in my hands, but when I'm high,

Speaker 2:          00:56:07       well, you know, that's what Mckenna believe that yoga was in the first place. Yoga set. Mckenna had this one lecture that was talking about a yogis and that the real secret about sod dues is that their highest fuck and what yoga really is is it's almost like

Speaker 3:          00:56:24       a how to manual on how to properly use cannabis and that they believe that eating cannabis especially or smoking hash and then going into the yoga poses would they would achieve these higher states of consciousness and so they would pass this down from generation to generation and the Indian in India rather, the Hindus have a long history of both eating hash and smoking hash and he believed that that was the dirty secret of Yoga. The Yoga was really all about how to use cannabis correctly, which is why it feels so good to stretch when you're high. I'll tell you a few things about that. What did I think it was the San Francisco Chronicle just last month or so had a piece about yoga where they basically asked people to smoke before they go and do the yoga class. The other thing is have you seen as will they say? What was the result?

Speaker 3:          00:57:08       I mean, people. It's the same thing. So many people are like me. They get more into their body. Right? That marijuana helps in that respect. You know, the other thing is, have you seen this book that was just reissue called Zigzags Ed? No. You should have this guy on Alan Alan. I'm a diner and zag zig zag zed and the paint. You know Alex Gray is the guy, the friend of mine. Alex is the one who did the artwork for it at Albert died or did the writing and as I recall what the book is about is he was struck by all of these kind of Zen spiritual leaders in America for whom their psychedelics experience in their younger years was pivotal to their evolution and to their becoming a master of some type of meditation, but who would not talk about it. Right. And it's. So. It's very interesting because you know, there's also, you have in some of these spiritual world, whatever, that they're looking down on the use of marijuana or psychedelics that you should keep your body as a sacred vessel and keep it free from these substances.

Speaker 3:          00:58:07       But in fact, you see a lot of evidence that these things go really well together. Well the issue is legality and also most of these people have actual jobs and when you have an actual job and you start talking about drugs, people look at you like you're some sort of a fucking crazy person. If you work as an insurance company and you say, well on the weekend, you know what I did this week and I smoked dmt with my friends and I experienced God, what the fuck is wrong with Ethan? I know it's crazy, asshole. Like. And then you get passed up for job promotions. I think you're a loose cannon. It can be detrimental to your interest or your family. Especially if you have children. There's a lot of people that have children that don't like to talk about drugs or even admit they smoke pot anymore.

Speaker 3:          00:58:46       I've experienced that resistance all over the place. Or what about the, you know, if your kids are inviting their friends over and then you have to worry about that. Your kid's friends will tell their parents, oh so and so's parents smoke weed or whatever. And then all of a sudden you have the neighbors and the fellow parents, you know, getting all worked up about that or tell their kids they can't go over. Well listen, I go through that mean that's me. You know, look, I have pot tattooed on my body now. I have a DMT molecule on my left arm. It's pretty well known that I'm in the drugs. I like them. I think they're awesome, you know, but I'm healthy as fuck and a also

Speaker 4:          00:59:22       an independent operator as Ami. But it's so true. I got to tell you, in my emails I get from people who have solid employees for 20 years and then a drug test popped out and they were totally fine at work. It's just because they got high in the weekend and they lose their job after 20 years except that sort of stuff that's going on. I think by the way, John Oliver maybe doing something on this issue soon. So it's a nonsense issue. The idea that you can get high on Friday and lose your job on Monday. How come you can get drunk all weekend and show up on Monday and we all tell you something. But now here's what. I'll give you a policy dilemma. So back in 2010, the ballot initiative in California legalized marijuana, Richard Lee, the fellow who was driving that and we agreed, we put in a provision there that basically said people could not be fired for testing positive for marijuana so long as they were totally competent work not high at work and there's one to protect people who were having a joint in the evening or on the weekend, right?

Speaker 4:          01:00:16       The Chamber of Commerce flipped out. Right? And the problem is, is you don't want to provoke some very powerful bears and all this sort of stuff. So now when we're drafting these initiatives around the country for 2016 and beyond, what we find is we do not include a clause protecting people because we know the one thing that might get the chamber of Commerce, so will flip out, you know, and to basically defeat the initiative. And then which had basically hope is that as marijuana becomes more legalized, you can read hesitant. And I think that's what's happening. I haven't looked at it yet in Oregon and Washington, but my guess is that the number of employers who are drug testing for marijuana is decreasing. Right? I mean, look, it's always been a bad way to determine performance, right? Because we know marijuana stays in the system, you know, the craziness of drug testing.

Speaker 4:          01:00:58       If you want to get totally bombed at a Friday night and be okay at work Monday morning in terms of drug testing, don't smoke a joint for alcohol and cocaine is the right combination for you. That's a crazy message to same with drug testing, right? So because cocaine's out of your system. Exactly in the alcohol, same thing. It's stupid, it's really stupid. And these stereotypes are ridiculous. These stereotypes and pot smokers are dominant, lazy, and you know, they, they, they insult me, you know, it really drives me nuts and I, I hate having defended because it's, it's, you're defending just ignorance. Stereotypes that were propagated by reefer madness. I mean that was really started it all off. And the effectiveness of the propaganda that hearst publications put out in the 19 thirties. It's a magazine, how well that worked almost a hundred years later. You know what else it is, and I used to make this analogy more often than I do today, but I'd say you know something in America, 50 years ago, everybody knew a gay person.

Speaker 4:          01:01:56       They just didn't know they knew a gay person, right, and therefore their image of who was gay was determined by what they saw in the media. Somebody getting arrested in a men's room or somebody flamboyantly walking down Christopher Street in New York City or people who are very, very feminine right now. Of course everybody knows a gay person, right? It could be their cousin or their employer, the it's all around the place and therefore our image, who is the gay person, right? Has become. We don't have any associations, is just the person who seems a feminine or just a person doing odd stuff will. Similarly with marijuana, everybody in America knows not just a marijuana user, but a responsible marijuana user. The problem is they don't know. They know that therefore who's their image of the person who uses marijuana user, they think of that high school dropout or the kid with hemp leads in as broad blond dreadlocks who's a troublemaker at school.

Speaker 4:          01:02:45       They think of their friend's kid who got in trouble with drugs. That's who they think. Now mind you, the kid who just got straight a's in is going to an ivy league school or uc Berkeley or Stanford or whatever and who's also smoking weed. That kids being more discreet and nobody knows he's doing. We'd except his friends so we have a biased image of who in fact the marijuana user has been in America now. As it becomes more legalized, as people become more open and out with it. I had been struck at all the people I've known for many years. We're finally saying to me and admitting to me that they've been using marijuana or psychedelics regularly for a long time. Now we're seeing that thing begin to shift in our society the same way we saw it happening with gay people in this school.

Speaker 2:          01:03:23       I think you're right and I think I've seen a giant shift just within the last 15 or so years, you know? Um, I started smoking pot when I was 30. I'm 48 now, so I've been smoking pot for 18 years and before I smoke pot I thought it was for losers. I really did. I got lucky. I met my friend Eddie Bravo and he is a really creative musician and explained to me that it helps them like write music and create music and he's an interesting guy that I used to do Jujitsu with. That's also a weird thing about martial arts, a tremendous amount of UFC fighters smoke pot, I mean a massive amount where it's a huge issue for them with involving drug tests, you know, that they have to stop smoking weed for the last four weeks or so in order to pass drug tests. When I say I mean more than, more than don't more, more UFC fighters smoke pot than don't. Same thing. True of the NBA, the giant nfl

Speaker 4:          01:04:18       I had, I met a football player ever retire full player, Marvin Washington at the end of last year. And he was spending about have all the medical marijuana thing, but he's really brilliant guy and he cares about the broader policy issues. We landed up drafting with him and three other pro bowl, you know, pro bowl winners. I'm basically a public letter calling on the NFL to change it's marijuana testing policy to admit that marijuana has medical value, that it's safer for many players that when it comes to dealing with concussion injury, that marijuana may actually have a therapeutic. I mentioned to it, not just made does without a doubt. So the evidence there, I was also encouraged to inflammatory properties of it. Do you see the US, the International Olympics Committee. What they've done now is I think they've changed the level or when they test for marijuana, so they base their saying if you haven't, if you haven't used marijuana, you know, within the 24 hours before a match, you're not our concern anymore. So you see an evolution happening and at different rates in different types of professional sports, you do. And it's, it's,

Speaker 1:          01:05:18       it's so important. It really is because otherwise you're basing your laws and your. The way you punished me blind ignorance. It's just foolishness and the idea behind it is for what are you doing? Yeah. I mean it came out. I mean part of this was we came out of the drug war ideology, right? Drug testing sleeps into American society and the Ronald Reagan days in the mid eighties, drug work goes crazy and the late eighties, everybody's feeling you have to drug test most major corporations or drug testing. So we just got caught up in that. Being in a, a professor at Princeton late eighties, early nineties and I saw the kids like they knew they were going to be applying for jobs. We needed to be drug tested and it just began to shape the whole way they thought about this sort of stuff. Yeah. It's just so unfortunate because it doesn't make you a bad person.

Speaker 1:          01:06:01       It doesn't make you a lazy person. These are what's in what the thoughts that are implied and testing people. The idea is like, Hey, I am your employer. I don't want you fucking up on the weekend and then coming into work on Monday. All scrambled, but there's no evidence of that at all. Well, I would say this, I mean I would always want to do is to give the other side what I think might be true, where might conform with own experience. For some people, marijuana, smoking too much. Marijuana does make them lethargic. Some people smoke it at work. If people look, nobody wants kids wake and bake and before they go to school, right? Some people can smoke marijuana 24 slash seven. It's sort of medical. Does it harm the workability? Other people, it's a problem. You know, it can be a motivating. For some people.

Speaker 1:          01:06:43       Look, it's a drug and that means that some people can use it in the wrong ways problematically. The problem is, and this is where we fundamentally agree for the large majority of people who use marijuana do so responsibly and are not having a problem with it, and there's a huge number of people use marijuana in a way that actually enhances their life and there are many of them who find it preferable to using pharmaceutical medications or alcohol or things like that. There are people I know, brilliant intellectuals and academics who've done some of their best work and come up with some of their best ideas under the influence of marijuana or psychedelics, so marijuana can be a huge positive in many people's life. It can be neither here nor there in some people and for some people to negative there, including Carl Sagan, who was a huge proponent of marijuana.

Speaker 1:          01:07:24       I think that the people that have issues with marijuana have issues and that's one of the things that's been sort of dusted under the rug. You're blaming it on marijuana. These people that smoke pot and it ruins their life. I mean, I had a joke about it where I was like, it's just because pot got there first. It could have been anything that fucked your life up. It's usually some sort of an underlying traumatic issue that you're trying to run away from or hide or cover up. Yeah, I mean the problem of course is when people in power a whole. I mean I'll tell you on both ends of the country, governor Cuomo, Governor Brown, I don't know what their issue is. Marijuana. Well, their issue is that there there's, there's financial interests that are trying to lead them in the way of illegal. John.

Speaker 1:          01:08:05       I don't think so. I actually think that I've talked to both of them about it and I can see and both of them are Willie. I think both of them had been decent governors and other areas of their life. I think some of the okay on sort of rolling back some elements of the drug war. They're kind of mixed in that regard, but cuomo just has this weird anti marijuana thing. I don't get. And Brown talked to him a few months ago at this same thing and when you're saying, okay, well let's be specific, like what? It's not political for quote Como being such a jerk, a New York's medical marijuana law and trying to carve it down so only like five businesses can run this thing. I mean all the stuff he did the. It's got a medical model supported by 80 percent of New Yorkers. Right. There was no political reason for him to do that sort of stuff, but somehow some weird anti marijuana things in there, but then hold on, but that doesn't seem like an anti marijuana thing at all.

Speaker 1:          01:08:53       When you're talking about boiling down to five businesses, it sounds like a business look, there may have been some of that theory, but in been. Well that seems like the only motivation there's. It seems to be there's no rational motivation other than financial and in Iowa know because in the end there was a whole competitive process through that. The five licenses, it's hard to. So whether the governor friends, we haven't seen any evidence yet that it was governor, his buddies who benefited. I think there was something that he felt a need to be hyper controlling in this area. I think sometimes people go to that ignorance, he's got to know the financial massive profit margin, the massive, uh, the possibility for profit of these people are going to experience that does not ignorant. He's got to know that you're talking about something in Colorado that just the tax revenue alone has been 100 million dollars.

Speaker 1:          01:09:40       A good reason for him to have done the right thing. Right. The question is why does a guy like that? I try to sabotage a good bill and put it in a bad bill in place once I, you know, I don't know. I only know some. Sometimes you think it could be something involving a friend of theirs, a kid of theirs, their own personal experience. I think it's something personal oftentimes. And with Jerry Brown, I've, I've heard rumors with both governors if they used to smoke. I've never heard I've other people say, oh no, these guys at Brown in California didn't used to smile more shocking that he did. Who knows? But I mean, I gotTa tell you Jerry. Hi. Right. And I talked to Jerry. Jerry think marijuana is the downfall of American civilization right? I mean, but there's a part of that. He actually, he's don't say that publicly and privately and he actually seems to almost believe that at times, and I think the other part of his brain is smart enough to know that's ridiculous, but there's a lot of people who have had a negative encounter with marijuana.

Speaker 1:          01:10:29       They've had a kid who started smoking weed and waking and baking and went and got into bigger trouble with other drugs and I think they just like, this is bad, this is bad. Or there people have had experienced problems with alcohol and their family and they think if alcohol was that bad, weeds going to be even worse. I think there's still that irrational stuff driven. Oftentimes by knowing somebody or knowing of somebody with a associate marijuana with bad things have happened to that person. I think Jerry Brown, Jerry Brown has got a bigger problem and that no one even knows he's the governor. The guy became the governor of California after Arnold Schwarzenegger and no one paid any attention was literally no one even knows he's the governor. You never fucking hear governor Jerry Brown, like you said that, and I had to and I know and I, you said that I go, oh yeah, he's the governor. Oh yeah. I forgot sometimes that's a good sign,

Speaker 2:          01:11:14       but he used to be the governor a long time.

Speaker 1:          01:11:16       Everybody knows Jersey and you know, he ain't so

Speaker 2:          01:11:20       there anymore, but he was the governor and he was an interesting candidate for president in the 19 eighties. Right. It was the eighties or nineties

Speaker 1:          01:11:27       to maybe what year was it? Might've been [inaudible] 92. The year that Clinton.

Speaker 2:          01:11:32       Yeah, it was a long ass time ago and you know, they would call them moonbeam governor Moonbeam and they were making fun of him, but he had some unique ideas when it came to running for.

Speaker 1:          01:11:42       I actually thought he was a really interesting candidate back then. I remember that. I remember and I actually from New York, you know, it's fine. When I bumped into a plane, we're chatting and then we're making Chitchat as the plane lands and he goes to, how's that? How's that New York Governor Yours Doing Cuomo? And I say he's Kinda like, Yo, he's a pretty good governor overall, but he stinks on the things that matter when it comes to drug policy.

Speaker 1:          01:12:02       No, it actually not all those things. I said it to his face and we're ready to get hit and now he left last. Let's say you didn't see smiled. He smiled. Yeah. Yeah. No comment though. I got to tell you, you want to see something ugly. Go on Youtube and type in the words rude debate or type in the words. Really rude debate. And what pops up is me and Jerry Brown pummeling one another and amy goodmans democracy now show in 2008 when we had a ballot initiative that would have been the biggest prison reform ballot initiative in the history of America. And Jerry Brown was then the attorney general and he did everything he could to kill it. And so we just went at it one day about what, what, what? What's his rationalization? I think at that point he wanted to run for governor. He wanted at the prison guards behind them, the prison guards union was making very clear that if they were going to be sport, he had a blocked this. They got every former governor and governor, governor and gubernatorial candidates to get up and stand up against this. I got to tell you, if California passed that ballot initiative prop five back in 2008, it would've solved the big part of the prison problem in this state at that time.

Speaker 2:          01:13:02       That seems like I hear stuff like that. I feel like it's treasonous. I really do. When I feel like a guy is doing for his own benefit, trying to block something that will be beneficial to people especially recognized and we have a huge issue with the prison industrial complex in this country and the idea that we had privatized prisons in the first place. The idea that someone's profiting off of putting people in jail and the idea that they're actively lobbying to make sure that there's more laws in place that are going to incarcerate people so that they can make more money. The idea that that's illegal is that that drives me a bit.

Speaker 1:          01:13:35       I gotta tell you with the between the prison guards union on the one hand and the private prison corporations, on the other hand please those guys, I mean just thank God they hate one another. The prison guards union and the private prison corporations, because those guys have just been feeding in that regard.

Speaker 2:          01:13:48       It's just money, man. It's just money. Whenever you get money involved in anything when it you getting money involved in pharmaceutical industries, when you get money involved in this, the marijuana thing with these five different corporations that are going to control all the pot money, fucking money. My people trying to get

Speaker 1:          01:14:03       it is, but the basic idea, Joe, were you saying before that that you have a prison guards union that needs to keep the prisons full in order to pad their overtime pay or that you have a prison? Corporations that are making money if more people get incarcerated and they'll end up becoming advocates for laws that lock up more people or advocates for opposing the reform of laws that are popping up, popping up. Too many people being a prison guards a shitty job, but those dudes need to do is grow. We'd have to do. You might know something interesting. That's a great job. Prison Guards Union did not oppose the marijuana legalization initiative in 2010. Really? Yeah, and I think the reason is, is a, I think there's two reasons. I think one is marijuana prohibition says a lot of people, local jails, but not that many of the state prison, but the second reason is if you're a prison guard and you're living in the middle of God knows where, you know, California surrounded by nothingness.

Speaker 1:          01:14:54       What do you want to do when you get home from work? You want to get high. Exactly. You know, in fact, I, I, my, my guess is the prison guards union. It's like anybody else right now, they probably got members of their union who are medical marijuana patients and dealing with state laws that probably prohibits. They're using marijuana. Do you think that with the current climate that we have, um, with social media and the ability to distribute information, and then when outrageous laws are trying to get past you can, you can tweet them and facebook them and people find out about them in this online petitions. Do you think that this, this is lending itself more to transparency, this transparency is beneficial to getting these more rational laws passed or more, more rational ideas promoted? It's a great question. I think it leans in our favor.

Speaker 1:          01:15:43       It's not the cure all. It means that the ability of young people to express themselves to legislators, the fact that more and more legislators pay attention to facebook and twitter and things like that, I think that's generally good for us. On the other hand, what I also know is that we now see not just on legalization of marijuana, we see all this bipartisan consensus that just too many people behind bars in America that we need to reduce the prison population. That there's this horrible racism permeate our criminal justice system that the incarceration of black people in this country is just an absolute humanitarian and social and racial nightmare. Right? So we see all of that happening. We see bills being introduced to reducing the prison population in the states and had congressional level and then a new drug scare pops up. All of a sudden it's Flocka or best salters synthetic cannabis or blah blah, and then there's this knee jerk reaction like, you know, criminalized first ask questions later.

Speaker 1:          01:16:36       Right? And that's the thing we're still dealing with that people will begin to come to their senses about more sensible policies and then they get scared and when they get scared they do. Some things don't do dumb things and pass bad loss. That's interesting because things like bath salts only exists because what we would call quote unquote legitimate drugs are illegal. So you find a work around why is both Cynthia, what's the market for synthetic cannabis. Most of that has to do with the fact that people are worried about drug testing for marijuana at all. You're not going to get picked up. I normally would choose if you had a choice between regular pot or synthetic, whatever the fuck it is. What is that stuff anyway, and what does it even coming from? You know, it it, it's either synthetic cannabinoids or maybe it's also, I think Catherine own, which is the ingredient that's in caught, you know the thing they choose issue in east Africa, east Africa and Yemen.

Speaker 1:          01:17:25       That's like a amphetamine. It's a stimulant and it's sort of like used the way the Indians to coca and Bolivia and Peru, Colombia, so it's a. When it's done in the chewing, the leaf, it's fairly innocuous. When you extract the chemical, you can then make it into something much more potent and much more problematic. See, I was under the impression that even chewing the leaves had more of a, an amphetamine like effect. It is. It's the same thing like chewing cocoa leaf, right? Chewing coca leaf releases. It's slow drip of cocaine into the system, but it's basically almost a healthy form of cocaine consumption. Isn't that funny? Yeah. It's hilarious that the leaves itself, like chewing the leaves. Like I have a friend who was recently in Peru and they, they would all do it. They give, they give you like a bag of it and they were on these hikes and they would chew it.

Speaker 1:          01:18:10       And I liked, what was it like? He's like, well, it's like coffee, but better. Yeah, exactly. And it's actually has like flavonoids in it and you know, like a vegetable proteins or um, what were the properties of vegetables that are healthy, like a vital nutrients like different, like it's actually good for you. You're chewing green vegetables. When eight years ago the World Health Organization organize a global study of coca and cocaine. It experts from 19 countries and after this extensive survey, what they found were two things. One was that the vast majority of people who use cocaine, sniff cocaine, whatever, did not have a problem with it. We're not addicted to it. Even though there was obviously a minority, you had a big problem. The second thing they found was that the chewing of coca leaf by the Indians probably headed net benefit from the health perspective for exactly the reasons you're talking about.

Speaker 1:          01:18:59       The we're vitamins and the leaves that the, that the, they were consuming. When you chew coca leaves during the day, you're consuming essentially the equivalent of a few lines of cocaine, which over the course of a day is like having a few cups of coffee in a way. Right. And what they found is the only downside was that to release the cocaine from the coca leaf, you had added a little lie and the lie could hurt. I think something had achieved the enamel in the teeth, something like that. There's an issue with people that chew coca leaves all the time to have these rotten teeth. I, yeah. That may be from the lime. I don't know. It may just be that they generally have bed height, you know, teeth hygiene and those parts. It's just like people say about meth mouth and losing your teeth. It's not about methamphetamine per se, it's that nothing sort of, you know, reduces the moisture in your mouth. And so you have to take extra special care of your teeth if you're using amphetamine with any regularity. And most people know that people taking amphetamine aren't taking extra special care of anything. Well, the funny thing is this, if you look at the 10 to 20 million kids, teenage boys in America taking Ritalin or these things so they can focus better in school. Some of them being prescribed appropriately, others not. It's essentially the, as the amphetamine or

Speaker 3:          01:20:07       methamphetamine crazy and the methamphetamine that people are smoking, getting in trouble with. If you take that in an oral form like a pill, it's essentially indistinguishable from the riddle and the kids are taking in schools, you know, I was reading an article on the sugar and the, the um, the negative aspects of sugar, processed sugar and how much of it is in our diets and how much of it is and things that you don't even consider. And that's really essentially the same thing when you talking about extracting it from fruits because everybody agrees at eating fruits is healthy. And that's, I mean, when you're eating bananas and you're eating apples and oranges, what, why, why does it taste good? Well, you know, there's sugar in it, natural sugars, but those natural sugars, when you get them in that form with the fiber, with the planet itself, with the vegetable itself, is actually good for you.

Speaker 3:          01:20:51       It's actually the same as the coca leaves, three most powerful drugs knowing that you have been kind sugar, fat, salt, sugar, fat, salt, sugar, fat and salt, and that the ability of the sort of food producing corporations and their science and their ability to produce products that kind of, you know, hit that part of the brain in a be that sort of is beyond your capacity when they look at the explosion of obesity and, and people being overweight in America and many other parts of the world. Part of that is about the ability of food producing companies to produce products that hit that part of the brain. I remember Chris Rock, he won't play, do in a routine, and he was talking about a Krispy Kreme donuts and it was found the secret ingredient of Krispy Kreme donuts cocaine. Right? But in point of fact, if you think about it, I remember walking past the Krispy Kreme donut outlet when they first opened up and you could not walk past it without this part of your brain twitching, right?

Speaker 3:          01:21:43       In the same way that somebody is addicted to drugs, get to twitch when all of a sudden you know they smell or see that drug in place. So the power of those substances, there's psychoactive properties we're used to them. These are powerful drugs we know and love, but in point of fact, if you ask what's doing more harm to the health of Americans today? Sugar, refined sugar or cocaine or heroin, could well be refined sugar. Well, there's an article, like I said, that I was reading that was they were making the argument that it's a toxin. There were saying essentially says sugar is a very common toxin that people consume. But as you say, when it's consumed in natural forms or for that matter, consumed in moderation, no big deal. But when you're taking large amounts, when we see all the drinks, yeah, I mean just what you get in a glass of Coca Cola.

Speaker 3:          01:22:32       That's way more sugar than you're supposed to have in your day and it's in a coke, coke and how many people have three, four cokes throughout the day and you see these people with their guts and they have all these issues with their body and your face is fucking fat. Like what is that that? Well, that's. You're taking in too much sugar, way too much. When you look at people from the early 19 hundreds, what they looked like, I mean obviously a lot of that has refrigeration. They didn't have as much food. People were much smaller than because they weren't. It was literally malnutrition, so common aspect where we've gone completely the other way now we have enormous human beings. People are way bigger than ever. The. It's a small world ride and Disneyland had to be. They had to carve their trench deeper. They had to shut down the ride and carve their trench deeper.

Speaker 3:          01:23:14       I was at Disneyland the other day and I was with my daughters and their friend, so there was three little girls and me, but we couldn't sit in the same row because you can't have more than three people because they've got this thing. I'm like, I weigh more than the three of them do together. Like this is crazy. Like you can't know with them. What are the airlines going to adjust the width of the seats to accommodate this and. No kidding, right. I travel a lot and my one nightmare is being in sitting next to somebody who's just kinda double size and all of a sudden part of them's mic. How about triple a, but my friend Ralphie may a stand up comedian. I don't know if he flies first class, but even if he does, it's not first class enough. He's 500 fucking pounds.

Speaker 3:          01:23:54       I don't know how. I don't. I literally don't know how he does it. Although I did read that the country is turning the corner on this. That is actually beginning to come down really fast. People are dying. Uh, I think the message is beginning to sink in, really know some of it is just a matter of just kind of being a little more conscious, you know, I mean that whole supersize me stuff and all this kind of stuff, but once you get that big, it's way past that. That's lap band stuff. Well, Ralphie's had a couple surgeries. I think he's had at least two of those lap band things. He blows through them. You know, when you, uh, I know several people who've had that operation broke, whatever. They fixed the shrink your stomach down and then you wind up having to go back and having another operation because you're stretching this tiny new stomach out too much because it be, it's a psychological issue more than is even a physical issue.

Speaker 3:          01:24:46       It's the same thing when you're talking about people that abused marijuana, marijuana that's causing you to do that, or is it some underlying trauma that you're trying to smother with food, with sugar, with pot, with alcohol, with whatever the fuck it is. It seems like the psychological issue is as much of a factor as the physical addiction. And there can be no doubt there are physical addictions to food and sugar, but what is really going on there that's, that's overwhelming your life and making you indulge in it. And to some people would say, and I think there's, there's really something to this, is that if we have an epidemic of anything in our country and maybe in many modern societies, it's pain and it's a combination of a pain that sometimes manifests physically, but it actually has to do with emotional pain and a sense of emptiness and the food and psychoactive drugs or ways of filling this sort of stuff. I mean, I will tell you that we were talking about back pain and all this sort of stuff before and about the overuse of opioids probably back in the early nineties. Two things happened to me in short order that really affected, really powerfully affected my understanding of the mind body relationship. The first one was doing Mtma for the first time and that was sort of just kind of not just mind opening but openly with my conscious. Is there a mind body consciousness?

Speaker 4:          01:26:04       But the second one was I had gone through three terrible episodes of back pain and Sciatica and and I, you know, I did Mris and cat scans and I had a herniated disc at the l, four L, five l five s one the whole sort of thing. I was 48 hours away from being operated on, you know, I knew the operation surgery is risky. And then I called a friend of mine, Andy Weil, Dr Andrew Weil who's a well known integrative medicine guy and he said, don't get the surgery. He said, go see this doctor, this guy named John Sarno at the end one you're talking about. And soreness theory was all of this stuff about herniated disc causing lower back pain and leg pain radiating down. He goes, it's overwhelmingly bullshit. And his theory is that what's really going on is that it's, there's nothing physically wrong with your body, that there's underlying emotional anger, angsty feet, whatever it might be, and that your brain plays a trick by turning this emotional pain and physical pain.

Speaker 4:          01:26:58       And it does that through a process of reducing the flow of blood around those nerves. And muscles, et Cetera. So without going on with this, this approach, Sarno approach worked for me. I went from having this horrific pain to sort of coming out of it very quickly. Being able to pick up my little daughter again, do the sports I used to do, and seeing myself as having a totally healthy back though Sarno believes right that it's not just lower back pain and Sciatica. Right. And he uses. This is not just faith healing. This is what I mean pretty he, he's his stuff is 90 percent supported by the science on this stuff more than any other, any other theory of this stuff. But his thing is that a lot of pain is probably underlying emotional pain being turned into physical pain and then we deal with that through food, through alcohol, opiates, whatever it might be. And the reason why we ended up getting into such trouble with drugs or with food is because we're trying to address this underlying almost existential pain. Not by dealing with what's really causing it, but by trying to feed it things that we think will cover it over now. Sardo's. Right. And My, I can't prove these right, but based upon my own personal experience and my reading and my understanding what's going on with drugs and food in this country, I think there's a lot there.

Speaker 2:          01:28:06       Well, Sarno certainly has some really good points, but there are definitely some physical aspects to numbness and bulging discs impeding on nerves and atrophy like atrophied limbs, which is a big problem with athletes that have nerve issues were bulging discs pushed down on nerves and it actually cuts the nerve supply to the muscles themselves and caused them to atrophy. That's real. That's all real injuries are real, but I think it's very important though, that you recognize in it. Everybody hearing this recognizes that there are legitimate injuries that you have. Well, it's hold on, yeah, through your discs, bulge out and impinge, impinge on nerves, and you need to get that treated and there's a bunch of different ways to treat that that don't involve surgery. Yoga is one of them. Yoga is a really good one. Another one is decompression because I've gone through all this. I've had some series bulging disc injuries from Jujitsu and the, you know, I've had Mris that show this issue and I've dealt with all it without surgery

Speaker 3:          01:29:02       so it can be done, but click. It's important to the. There are people that have legitimate injuries. Yeah, no, no question about it. I think even Sarna would say there are people who have legitimate injuries. How did you hurt yourself? That's the whole thing. See, part of what Sarno points out is that now that we have Mris and cat scans being done commonly in our society, that if you take 100 people who are showing that they have herniated this, right, and you have 100 people who were showing no herniated disc, you'll have the same incidence of back pain would whole show. Is that the evidence that some when you see that the people assume there's a causal relationship between that MRI or cat scan of the herniated disc and that lower back pain now could be that you've had a serious injury, right? You've been hit by a car, you'd been at a sports injury where there really is something going on there, but for many people there's not a serious injury.

Speaker 3:          01:29:50       There's some little thing that kind of triggers it, but then somehow it transforms and this and then he looks at people live in other societies were lower back pain and Sciatica or not sort of accepted reasons for missing days of work or all this sort of stuff and he finds much lower incidence of these pain. Right? And the same thing. Look at the carpal tunnel thing. What's that about? I mean, people have been typing typewriters forever and ever and ever and all of a sudden we have this epidemic of this thing, right? And then somehow that epidemic begins to fade, is replaced by something else. Well, let's hold on a second there because carpal tunnel is real and we're one of the reasons for carpal tunnel, repetitive stress, repetitive stress causes inflammation. Inflammation locks up when you're forced to sit at a keyboard in the same position over and over again and repeatedly do the same exercises.

Speaker 3:          01:30:32       You absolutely do. Put undue stress on your hands and on your wrist, and if you're not prepared for it, if your body's not conditioned and you're you, you're not a rigorous person, you can have real issues with it. My mom had to have surgery for carpal tunnel. I mean, it's legitimate. Then raise the question we had in the 1920, 30, 40, 50, sixties and seventies, tens of millions of American, mostly women who were typing eight hours a day, 12 hours a day. Well, first of all, I couldn't type as fast because there was the whole reason why the court, he method was invented to keep the keys from binding up because now we don't need that because you have your fingers just gently touch these things. You can do it really quickly. The other thing is diet. Um, there's a lot of inflamed inflammation. Promoting foods are foods rather than cause inflammation.

Speaker 3:          01:31:15       And that's just a fact. Sugar is a big one. Alcohol is a big one. Process, flowers, wheats, like things that your body has to break down which breaks down to sugar. Like this big thing in this country, like gluten free. This gluten free that go what? What it is gluten. There are people that have gluten intolerances, celiac diseases, things on those lines. People have wheat intolerance, but I think it would. A lot of it is is just sugar because if you're eating bread that your body breaks that stuff down. Process, flowers directly to sugar, bread and pasta, all that. That white stuff, that's shit's not natural. You're breaking it down. Your body takes that bleached process. Flour and it converts it directly to sugar and sugar causes inflammation and that's. That's a huge issue with people. Yeah. I'm no expert on all that sort of stuff, Joe, so I don't know.

Speaker 3:          01:32:02       I'll say that. My takeaway from going through that pain experience and all the reading I've done and this thing is that when it comes to treating certain farms of chronic pain like this, that the approach that works best is the one that won most believes in, right? Whether it's Chiropractic, whether it's yoga, whether it's Sarno, whether it's surgery. The reason why surgery tends to have the most immediate benefit right away is because surgery is effectively the most powerful placebo there is, but when you see research that's showing the three years after people who have had back surgery are as likely to have a back problem is that people did not have the surgery. You have to start questioning the evidence around some of that. Actually, it's because of lifestyle choices. I mean if you think about a person who has surgery for a back issue and then three years later they have more issues, most likely they're living a life in the exact same way, which means they're putting the same stresses on their body they were doing before like sitting at a desk all day or doing something like you're picking stuff up.

Speaker 3:          01:32:58       Folks that work in warehouses and things along those lines and you have to pick stuff up all the time and your body's not conditioned for it. So you have repetitive stress in that regard. There's a lot of issues and you know what caused it. You may be right. That could be it and that certainly can trigger the pain, but I'm going to tell you, having been through the experience and I've met many people a since that who for whom at work I think and because the Sarno approach, if it works for you, is one way. You get to see your body as whole once again and not as vulnerable and because it pushes you to deal with underlying emotional stuff that may be driving some of this physical pain. I mean for all those reasons, I think my. My view is when people ask me and I'll say, read sorrows book, you know, on back pain, right?

Speaker 3:          01:33:39       Or healing back pain and I'll say if it doesn't make sense to you, try something else. But the thing about desanto thing is if it does work for you, it's in some respects the most miraculous of all the. I think the Sarno approach is a great approach. Don't get me wrong, but I don't think they're mutually exclusive to taking care of your body in a physical sense. And I think that most people just don't take care of their body in a physical sense. They don't exercise. I think exercise is, and especially treating your core as if it is the foundation of your body, something that supports you all day long, you're back, you know, there's very few people work out their back in a sense of like long static exercises like yoga where you're holding poses for 30 seconds, you know, and doing one after the other and doing it over a course of Oregon.

Speaker 3:          01:34:20       It's not fun. Like you said, he can't get into it because you don't find it enjoyable, but the benefits of doing that, man, I'm telling you, I just got into it a bit less than a year ago. I've been doing on a weekly basis, like fairly regularly. The benefits are tremendous for me. Your, your back just feels way better. Just feels like you have more. There's more vigorous with it. More with core exercises, with Yoga, with yoga exercises, Yoga. A big part of what yoga works is what we call our core. I mean it's literally your, your, your spine, you know, from your neck down to your back. And that's a big part of what you're holding these poses. And you know, you have to hold your in a straight line, like what are you doing? You're, you're, you're supporting everything with your back and with your spine sound like lifting weights is, it's a different sort of thing where you're holding your own bodyweight.

Speaker 3:          01:35:09       Well, I'll tell you something to return to where our conversation got going. One of the great things about living in Manhattan is we walk and the result is that there's a lower incidence of obesity in Manhattan than there is in most of the United States. Makes Sense. And that walking is one of the safest even for people who don't want to take out the time to exercise because walking is the way we get places. It turns out that we land up to believe relatively healthy lives in a place like Manhattan, not was standing all the crazy. What are you doing when you're walking? You're carrying me. What do you weigh? One hundred and 80 pounds or something like carrying that 180 pounds around. Whereas that amount of energy and that amount of calorie expenditure is lost if you're sitting in the car driving to work, getting in an elevator, going to your office, sitting in your cubicle, all that's lost, all that's lost and it's probably thousands of calories a day.

Speaker 3:          01:35:58       You're also making me think about when I remember my experience with him Dma, uh, you know how there are some people when they do an and they just like to sit and get in a place and other people like me just want to move, move around, know, get the energy going and such. You know, I also found some times he only talked about going back to the whole mushroom thing. I remember feeling especially that. So it's the mushrooms you take them and they start to come on and I can find like, it's like this energy force going into your body and in some ways the best way to deal with that stuff is movement. It's running, it's swinging around, it's moving around, like opening up your body to lift that powerful energy. Yet, you know, I think there's a lot of tension that people carry around their bodies or their bodies just aren't being used correctly or they're bunched up or they're not stretched out and are confined and bound up and they have poor posture and then the stress of life and bills and all the things that are weighing down in.

Speaker 3:          01:36:49       I think in that sense Arno's out an excellent point that pressure and stress and pain and just frustration just causes you to be tense and everything is fucked up and if you can address that and sort of relax a little bit, just that alone just to alleviate a lot of tension and that's a lot of what people carry around them. That's also a lot of what people like about pot. Like you said that how we used to like to smoke pot and stretch out what's going on there. You're releasing releasing tension. He smoked pot like, man, I love doing that before a show. I like smoking a little weed before show and stretching out and that was one of my favorite things to do. Just sit, sit in a dressing room before I go on and just stretch, warm up, loosen up my back, stretch my back out and stretch my body out.

Speaker 3:          01:37:32       It's. It's something that we don't do enough. You buy your meat vehicle, move that fucker around. I know, I know. It's true. Look man, I work in an office a lot of the time and it's just so easy to get in that zone and you're in front of that computer. That's what you're doing, you know, and all the sudden you realize your shoulders about. You're exactly right when you're going, especially if you have bad posture, you carrying it. Like if you're sitting like I, you know, when I had my back injury, which was sports related, but when I started getting treatment for it, I realized there's a lot of other underlying issues and one of them is if you're sitting in a desk and you have poor posture, the strain has been a lot of studies done on this street is in a very specific area, so instead of being straight where your back is carrying the weight in an even form through the top of your head all the way down to your lower back, you're causing this undue spot, this weird spot in the middle by slumping where you get all this pressure in this one area that really shouldn't be there.

Speaker 3:          01:38:29       And over time, like cab drivers that have a, a thick wallet and they keep it in their back pocket and they sit on there. They developed bulging disks in their back. It's just the slow water that causes the rock to go smooth. Well, the other cuts of channel through put. I mean, for me, the thing I've learned from so many people, and it's basically the kind of common ingredient and almost all spiritual practices, meditative practice is just simple deep breathing, right? Because just having to fill your lungs just, it just forces you to have to sit up all of a sudden if you want to fill your lungs and that, that breathing, this just the slow breathing gets went to focus to center. I mean I know that when I'm stressed off the advantages, grabbing a drugs, I think that's the wrong way to use drugs.

Speaker 3:          01:39:13       Just trying to remember, take a breath, try to take five breaths, 10 breaths, slowly in and out, and that's one of the best centering things. There are. Well, you know, I've been teaching that to my five year old. I kind of taught her when she was three, when we started talking about it, like she would get upset, like something would happen. Like she would like stubborn pto or not even like a big deal, like hurt or something would something would get her upset and she would cry which was crying. And then I fell down and I do that. I'd be like, you've got to breathe in and breathe out. Let's do this together. We'll do it together. And I do it with her. I'm like, take a breath. And you're like, it's hard for them because they're, they're hyperventilating. But it made me realize like, wow, that's a lot of people that go through that with issues in life, you know, you have some incredibly stressful issue and it just overwhelms you and you take this shallow, panicky breath and you know, it's one thing when a three year old doesn't know how to deal with, you know, hurting herself or falling down or whatever.

Speaker 3:          01:40:11       What is that made her upset. But when adult, you know, gets to 50 years old and they still don't know how to deal with stress as kind of a tragedy. It's like either you have. We don't really teach that in our society anyway, you know, it's interesting to, uh, my, my niece has just started medical school and I was asking her what she was thinking of specialty shoes, thinking about. And I was saying to my, I think if I ever decided to pursue medicine instead of what I did do, I think the single most fascinating area of medicine right now is pain management. It is the most interdisciplinary of all areas because it requires you understand physical pain, you understand pharmaceuticals and biochemistry and understanding, but it also requires

Speaker 4:          01:40:54       that element of understanding things like breathing and exercise and the body and it's that area. I mean the pain is such physical pain is such an epidemic in America today for all these reasons. You and I are giving different reasons and agreeing on a lot of it, but I think that becoming a more thoughtful and sophisticated society in terms of how we deal with this, how will you alleviate it, how we prevent it and doing so in a way in which the government is playing a positive role as opposed to a destructive role. Because right now, right, the role of the government, these are the physicians who want to properly deal with pain management is intimidating them and scaring them. Then the way in which the pharmaceutical companies drive where drugs people have means that oftentimes people don't have access to the things they need. Meanwhile, the failure to think about the importance of breathing in our society of posture, the things you're talking about. Exercise is another element. All this sort of stuff and on some level I think, you know, look, a lot of the drug problem has to do with issues of race and class and stuff like that, but a lot of it also has to do with this kind of pervasive sense of pain, physical and emotional pain that people are trying to treat and all sorts of ways.

Speaker 2:          01:42:02       Yeah, I think you're right. I think it's also the requirements of life are really unnatural. The life that we've set up for ourselves, the requirements of managing bills and dealing with taxes and dealing with the stress of marriage and the nonsense that comes with divorce and the chaos that comes with all sorts of different aspects of our life. It just seems just overwhelming and then the existential angst of your own mortality compounding every day. The futility of getting up every morning when you want to stay in bed, the alarm goes off, hit that fucking button, he get up and you put your fucking clothes on just like every other day and you drink your coffee and you do your rituals and you go to a job that you find unsatisfying. That is the vast majority of Americans and probably have people in the world. I think that you live a fulfilling life. You're doing what you enjoy doing and I'm very lucky to feel the same way, but I think that we're in the minority and I think there's a large amount of people out there that are longing for something better than what they have. Whether it's a better relationship or it's a better connection to their family or it's a better, some rewarding thing to do with their time.

Speaker 4:          01:43:08       Well, you see, I mean, part of that explains why more and more people are seeking out the church, whether it's evangelical churches or other types of truth. I think so. I mean, look, you see those numbers grow in these mega churches that are happening.

Speaker 2:          01:43:19       The other. I think that the numbers of people that are involved in organized religion or

Speaker 4:          01:43:24       I think the ones who are going to the conventional churches, the more mainstream churches and synagogues, that's what's dropping the ones who are being drawn to the angelical ones, the ones where they sort of are more attentive to bring in the spirit and the body into the practice of religion. Right, but evangelical churches, you know, you, you dance, you move, you do all this sort of stuff. I think people doing the same thing in the world that we know of, psychedelics and doing these things. People want to link their body, mind their

Speaker 3:          01:43:52       spirit community. That's look at millions of people, young people now going to sort of the whole kind of a dance dance world, the nightlife world, all that stuff. Same thing that kind of almost collective quasi religious communitarian feeling of letting go in the company of others. I think people are so much want and need that and it's a good thing for people to do that. It's not hurting other people or people that are getting hurt in the process and that's another thing we started. Drug Policy Alliance is a whole project and trying to keep young people safe as they're in this whole night. Life Dancing, right? People are taking all these drugs are doing things. Somebody said drinking too much, they're overheating and people get hurt and the question is young people going out and enjoying themselves for hours or days, listening to music being another moving train and even doing mind altering drugs can be a perfectly healthy and good and even liberating thing, good for their lives, but we need to make sure it's being done safe.

Speaker 3:          01:44:48       That notion of making our societies as safe as possible for people to open up and let go, whether it's with or without drugs, I think is something we have to evolve towards. I think you're dead right, but I also think that the issue is that we haven't built a foundation of stability in these people up to this point where they're taking these exploratory journeys of the mind. I mean, they're. Their foundation is fucked up there. You know, there's so much going on outside of that they need to take care of before they just dive into the world of psychedelics and it's one of the reasons why people have bad trips. I mean, what is a bad trip? You're resisting all the things that these drugs are exposing. You put these blinders on, gone through this life and whether it's childhood trauma or you know, unfulfilled expectations that are haunting you, whatever it is that's that is causing the quote unquote bad trip.

Speaker 3:          01:45:40       A lot of what that is is resisting the message that these boundary desolving experiences are giving you. They're sending you as a message, as a. you're inherently unhappy. You're unhappy in, in almost like a cellular level and that it's not as simple as just like diving in and, and having a mushroom trip and it's all going to clear out. You've got to deal with the foundation of your own personality. I agree. The question is how do we do that really board, when you look at now, I mean look at younger people who are on the Internet, 24 slash seven. It's constant. You know, that people will look to stand on any corner and see the number of people walking around looking at their, at their, you know, little gadget, right? Looking at their facebook, looking at this or whatever, right? People are interacting with the world in an entirely different way. Right? And then of course the way society is evolving so quickly, you know, entrepreneurial folks can thrive, but for huge numbers of people, there's no sense of security about what the economy, the society is going to be like in the future. I mean we are kind of hurtling into the future. Artificial intelligence is going all sorts of crazy

Speaker 4:          01:46:50       places. All sorts of jobs are being displaced by robotics and things like that. So, you know, just talking with my daughter, my daughter who's now 20, about to be 27 and you know, it's just, it's, it's a, it's a whole. The world is, is the pace of change is so remarkable in this regard. There are so few guides and the ability of the parental world to play a constructive role. First of all, many parental, mainly parents aren't that good as parents or they're not that good at helping young people, you know? Um, but beyond that they're so disconnected sometimes from what's going on for, you know, kids growing up in a whole different way. Right. When I think when I was growing up in the sixties and early seventies, you know, the pace of change which so much slower than than it is now. Right. So I don't know what to curate all that stuff is.

Speaker 2:          01:47:35       Yeah. I think we're going to have to adapt to this new world where people are getting information. It's just staggering rate that you got to decide how to manage it. And you know, some like my friend Ari, Ari Shaffir, he switched to a flip phone and he's like, fuck this, I can't do this anymore because he would say he would tell me that he would get up in the morning and then he would spend like a half an hour going over facebook and going over all this and that before we ever got anything done. Now he just gets up and does stuff and if he wants to take care of all his bullshit, he does it on a computer. So he sits down, he says, okay, now I'm going to answer my emails. Now I'm going to. Instead of just constantly being attached to social media. Like I said, I had a weird experience. I accidentally signed up for facebook two weeks ago. I had this public facebook account which like my staff managed, but then my phone

Speaker 4:          01:48:21       got lost. I had to reset the whole thing and I had received my spotify account, was hooked up to my facebook thing and if that password, next thing you know, Bang, Bang, Bang. All of a sudden I created my own personal facebook thing

Speaker 2:          01:48:33       and so now I'm trying to feel what do I do with it. So I friended a few people. A few people I work with are all freaked out that the boss is thread to them, you know, and, and now I'm scrolling through and now I understand when people are looking at and it, you know, you just see you're talking about sugar, fat, salt. Nothing more addictive than that little gadget there. Yeah, it's very addictive. I've backed off way hard over the last few months. Over the last few months. I very rarely even go on my own message board. I have a message board on my website that I've had since 1998 and I go on there occasionally and check to see what what's going on in the news or what people are talking about are debating and this and that, but I find it to be. There's a massive requirement of time to check all these different things to check facebook and twitter and then there's social media. There's websites that I visited, his message boards that have visited different websites that aggregate news stories and it's just too much. It's just to back way off of it over the last couple.

Speaker 4:          01:49:32       I try to stick with the discipline that there will be at least once or a few times a year where I will go into a total blackout on any communication using that gadget. I did a vacation a few years ago for days where I did not pick up my laptop computer. Even my phone, my, you know, nothing right and know for the first day or two like my hand was like fidgeting, you know, like it was going through withdrawal from that whole sort of thing. But I have to say I got today six and I had achieved a level of calm that I associated with like, you know, biting surfing as a 12 year old on the beach. I mean it was so, so good and I got to tell you something, I haven't done it since I did it for a few days over Christmas. I am so looking forward to finding some days the next week or two or I'm going to do that again. Almost brings tears to my eyes. When I think about that level of disconnection I think. I think human beings need to do that.

Speaker 2:          01:50:29       Well I, I certainly don't think the word designed to deal with the influx of information and the opinions of other people are thrown at you on en masse. Like, like we get with social media. I just think it's too much and I think it's very addictive. Communication is addictive in just being able to, like you always think you're going to miss out on something. There's gonna be some new thing that comes out that you're not aware of and I think that managing that is really critical because we're not. We haven't developed to deal with that. This is a completely new thing and I don't think we're designed even media. I think just the movies and songs, there's a lot bunch of people running around out there that don't have a realistic view of human beings because their view of human beings is based on heroes in movies and songs playing. When people talk and everybody either acts no bully or they act obviously evil. It's like these ideas of human beings are shaped by 15

Speaker 4:          01:51:27       shannon when people are doing that, you're getting as opposed to reading reading novels as I did when I was younger but barely do today. You get a much more deeper nuanced sense of human beings by reading novels and you possibly can by watching a movie watching a thing. Right, so you're exactly right. Same thing with body shape, body consciousness, all the ways in which that's so screwed up in our society once again, shaped by the media. I mean I'm trying to do my few little disciplines like try not to look at my, at my phone over the last year, the last hour before I go to sleep because they say you sleep better if you don't do that, you know, just trying to find some space sometime. Try to turn off the ringer, you know, more often. Uh, just some way of carving out that space.

Speaker 2:          01:52:06       Yeah, I think that that's a good thing. It's a good thing to manage what's coming in. It's a very, very good thing to manage what's coming in because you just can't. You can't rely on all these other people to, to have access and to be able to input, you know, into your own mind is just too many. There's too many people out there that want to, first of all, how many people just want to bark at you to get attention? How many big review we're fucking doing. Your job pot would already be legal and you read. They're like, what the fuck, man, I don't even know this guy and he's yelling at me that I'm not doing my job. He doesn't know what I'm doing. He doesn't even know me. He doesn't want to know you, what he wants his attention and he's using this as a vehicle, like a whiny baby screaming out for attention. And oftentimes

Speaker 1:          01:52:46       that squeaky wheel does get the say. I don't even read a lot of that stuff that shows up on various know public allies when I speeches go up on youtube and stuff like that. But it's, it's, it's, it's true. It's just the other thing, of course there's a power dynamic here which is there for people who work for somebody. The risks that we're moving into society where your boss or your employer expects you to be accessible. Uh, you know, so like I let my staff, although at the alliance, if they get an email from me on a weekend, which they might, because I sometimes work on weekends, there was no obligation and they'll expectation that they answered, I think told Monday. Right? I mean that just so people know, there's a sense of space. I have a friend who goes to work on Monday and his boss will get pissed at him if he doesn't answer emails from the night before, like he'll get an email at night and he's like, why didn't you respond to that email?

Speaker 1:          01:53:34       And he's like, look, I, you know, I came home and spend time with my family is like, look, there's no excuse. Check your email, check your numbers. Like what the fuck kind of a job have I gotten. That's not the definition of a civilized society. Isn't that what's going on with trump testing? Because if someone's telling you that you can't smoke a joint after work, what they're telling you is they own your body, their own your body. Because if you smoke a joint at 9:00 at night and you go to work at 9:00 in the morning, guess what? That joints gone. It doesn't. The, the, the effects don't linger. Quite frankly, the employer has a greater basis. If you come to work Monday, nine morning hung over because that may of way have been. If you've been up all night because you were in pain or having a fight with your wife or your kid was sick, that may affect work performance, but the fact that you smoked a joint on a Saturday or do something else and you're finding a Monday, none of their damn business.

Speaker 1:          01:54:22       This is ultimately about sovereignty of our own minds and bodies. Right? I mean the core principle right here is that we're all sovereign over our own minds and bodies and that my boss, my government has no power to tell me what I do to my own body or in my own mind so long as I am not hurting another soul. That has to be the core principle of a free society. Not only that, it's the same sort of argument with wwe in respect to doing crimes when you're on these drugs like the crimes themselves or the issue and the punishment should be in relation to the crimes. They should have absolutely nothing to do with what substance caused you to do the crime. Exactly. That's exactly my you on this thing and said if you used drugs and you don't hurt a soul, that's none of the government's business.

Speaker 1:          01:55:04       If you use drugs and you go out and hurt somebody, well the fact that you use drugs so that you were addicted, right? You'd have to be held just as accountable, right? Somebody's drug addiction. It cannot be an excuse that it will allow them to do harm to others. That said, and there's a little position in the middle that if a judge in his wisdom or somebody else decides that you hurt this person and it was driven by your drug addiction and decides that you should go to some treatment program instead of jail because that's better for you and better for society than that might be the reasonable compromise, but ultimately people need to be held responsible for their actions. Is affects other people that were very well put, the compromise

Speaker 2:          01:55:44       and. But it's very difficult to leave that in the hands of the judges because when you. The judges impose their own moral ideas and attached the. I mean there's been so many instances. Just really recently there was a guy who got in a fight with his girlfriend's ex boyfriend and beat him up and the judge told him that if he didn't want to go to jail, he had to marry the girl. Like, who the fuck is this judge? And here's another one where this guy, this young boy, he was 19 years old, he was on this social media application. It's called hot or not. Were you? Someone decides whether or not they think you're hot. I heard it. Yeah. So he, uh, contacts this girl, she's 17, goes and drives to her house, has sex with her. It turns out she's 14. So now he's locked up. They put them in this, uh, this database as a sex offender. Yeah. And one of the, the judge, one of the judge's statements is that sex should be something that people do when they're in love and that it should be this very important thing to sacred thing. And you shouldn't be involved in these social media things where you just go around fucking each other. Like, who the fuck is it?

Speaker 4:          01:56:50       Tell Ya we haven't. My for drug policy alliance, the problem with drug court judges, I mean some of these guys are doing the Lord's work, but so many of them are simply imposing their own moralistic views about drug use. They're telling people, okay, I won't send you to prison as long as you clean and sober for the rest of your life for as long as you're under my supervision. And if somebody wants to smoke a joint, that becomes a basis for taking away their freedom. So there's something fundamentally wrong with assuming that judges who are not trained in these areas who have their own biases and prejudices should be determining the quality. You know how people live a life when they haven't done anything to hurt anybody else,

Speaker 2:          01:57:22       comes down to human beings being put in positions of power over other human beings and once you can dictate what happens to that person's freedom. That's intoxicating feeling to a lot of these guys and they or gals and they just choose to impose their own viewpoints on that person because they can. Because they gets. That's how they get their rocks off so that that's how they avoid their own existential angst. That's how they avoid their own depression by imposing power over these other people. It's judge Judy, right? I mean that's. That's. That's the whole show is that she's allowed to be. Yeah,

Speaker 4:          01:57:58       the most Venal of all the actors, but we're talking about the role, which money is driving the prison industrial complex in what you're saying about judges, the worst of all the actors or the prosecutors, those guys, because it's all about power. It's about interpersonal power. It's about power within the criminal justice system. For many of them, it's about making a name for themselves by beating up people and thereby, you know, running for politics and ultimately it's not money. In many cases it's about power, power and showing how effective you've been as a prosecutor. Kit

Speaker 2:          01:58:30       My record and then that sense, I liken it to sports. I think the real problem with prosecution and even with police, is that it becomes a winning and losing thing. If the guy got off, you lost. Not that the guy was innocent. It's not that you were incorrect in assuming that he had broken the law and should be punished by the laws of our society, by the rules that we've agreed to govern ourselves by. No, no, no. It's a game. It's a game like basketball that's driven game.

Speaker 4:          01:58:54       We've decided in America that we're going to have an adversarial system of justice. Right? That's a good way of putting it and, and, but what happens of course is that most of the power, unless you're rich, is in the hands of the government and the prosecutor. It's why poor people are getting. Look, why does America have the highest incarceration rate in the world? Why do we have the highest incarceration rate of any democratic society in history? Why do we lock up more black people at a rate that forest [inaudible] the rates of incarceration is Soviet gulags in the thirties, forties, and fifties. In part it's because we have an adversarial system that's fundamentally broken and we're the cops and the prosecutors drive this thing overwhelmingly, and we're a few are the typical person in that system who doesn't have money to hire a good lawyer. Stuff like that, you are going to be removed and you're going to be caught in a system where you may never escape it.

Speaker 4:          01:59:39       You know why America, we didn't use to be where we had a incarceration rate that was basically at the world average for most of our history, but the last 40 years we went ape shit in terms of locking people up in this country, especially black people. That's the thing we have to fight to pull back from. That's where we have to undermine the power of the of the money driven interest at corporations and the prison guard unions. It's where we have to challenge the abuse of power by, by, by, by, by judges and especially with prosecutors and they have to be pulled back in a major way and the sheriffs I should say because in California got to sheriffs who are the ones trying to build new jails and keep marijuana illegal and all this sort of stuff. That grows in judgment of power in the hands of people whose job it is to take away people's freedom and to use no judgment and the ways they do that or minimal judgment and the presumption that if you violate a law, you have to lose your freedom. That's what screwed things up so badly in our society. That's the movement we're trying to build to Ed and on that joke. I got to go to the next meeting.

Speaker 2:          02:00:38       Beautiful. You nailed it. Thank you sir. Really appreciate it. Let's do this again. When are you when you're in town? Often I come to town fairly often. I may be back here in October with a ballot initiative in California coming up in 2016. You know, so I'm here a lot and let's do it in October man. Come on back. Let's work on that ballot initiative to get people active. Sounds good. Thank you Ethan. Really, really appreciate it. Great to meet you. Great to meet you too. I really appreciate it. Thank you. Alright fuckers. See you soon.

Speaker 5:          02:01:02       Was Fun. That was great.
