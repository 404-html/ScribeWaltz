Speaker 1:          00:00:01       Start Broadcast Shazamm bitches. I think it's on where we live. Yeah. Excellent type fuckers. We're getting a little better. Three. Oh seven. Now that's a little bit better right? There we go.

Speaker 1:          00:00:32       Zoom. Zoom. What's happening? Five years? Everybody can hear us. So good. Let's leave it sideways. I believe it would a gangsta lean. Uh, hello everybody. Welcome to the. What is it? The fucking ninth weekly one or something company. We have continued. Motherfucking saga continues. Let's jump. This is how you drink coffee. Okay. Like a fucking man. See that's your right there. That's what's called a French Press. You can get it at tarbox. Starbucks. Starbucks for like 20 bucks or something or you know, I target for 20 bucks. That's what I was in the middle saying target and starbucks at the same time. You just grind up your coffee. The report in this motherfucker, you pour the hot water, you push down the plunger, but Bam. You Got Coffee? Yeah. It's gritty and it's got like little pieces of stuff in it. But. So what you fucking pussy man up man up man up and drink your coffee.

Speaker 1:          00:01:35       How is Australia? Australia? Is the shits if you've never been to Australia? It's fucking spectacular. It's beautiful. The people are cool as fuck. It's really bizarre man. It's way the fuck on the other side of the world, like literally on the other side of the world to where it's a 19 hour time difference between Los Angeles in Australia. What's. What's the laws like out there? Is there any. The weed is not very legal there. Yeah, but it's everywhere. Everybody's got wheat. Yeah. So because I got a text from mayhem right before we left because my mom got there before us and he said, Yo, this is the exact test. The exact text yo costumes. Here is a motherfucker. Don't bring any weed to kangaroo island.

Speaker 1:          00:02:26       Which have you known mayhem. That's a, that's a hand quote right there. I'm so ladies and gentlemen, a fucking trainer yesterday got killed by an work off. Do you hear about that shit? You didn't hear about that killer whale killed a trainer at seaworld. Wow. And what's amazing to me is how they haven't been killing people up to this point. Could you imagine if whales, killer whales, and it's supposed to be super intelligent. I mean, they're like as intelligent as humans, they're cousins of dolphins and we put them in a fucking fish tank and make them do tricks for mackerels, you know, can you imagine what kind of hell that life is? This a whale had killed a homeless man that snuck into the fucking tank in 1991 and he had also a, or it might be a sheet, I'm not sure he or she had also, I think it's also, uh, almost drowned a trainer.

Speaker 1:          00:03:23       What do you remember that video where the killer whale was playing with the person dunking him under that same same whale? Wow. Same Way. Yeah. So, I mean, it's not like the warning fucking signs weren't there. It's like, you know, you, you know, you hear Mike Tyson's punch somebody. You couldn't be shocked. Like, how'd he die? He, oh, it's a woman that died. He, uh, he grabbed her by the waist and just fucking ripped her up in the middle of a live show at the beginning of the live videos and said, well, that's a good question. I bet they confiscated everybody's cameras and shit as they were leaving the SD cards or system or you think you would learn to shove it up your ass or something like this guy. If he was there for sure there will be a video of it. 1,000 percent. We need everybody's camera's SD card up as save two.

Speaker 1:          00:04:14       You would have vetted, uploaded to youtube already. I'd already been Bluetooth. Can use stream. Yeah. There's no fucking way. I mean, could you imagine what that must've looked like? You're, you're there and all of a sudden the killer, he grabbed her about the waste and just started smashing her back and forth. Just ragdoll here. He just had enough. He just said, that's it. That's it motherfuckers, you know, it's really incredible that we think it's cool to do that. And then we go and watch them. You know, it's really like, zoos bums me the fuck out. We went to a zoo in um, Australia while we were there and there was a cool part of it was the crocodile cage because I don't think that crocodile gives a fuck where it is. I think crocodiles are so dumb. I mean they seem third mind seemed so dead.

Speaker 1:          00:05:04       They just lay there with their eyes closed underwater for like hours at a time where they don't have to breathe and I can brief for like an hour. So they just lay underwater and just do nothing and just sit there. They don't run around and play like when you pass like the monkey cage at a zoo, that shit's depressing because they don't want to be there. When I was in Denver, there's a zoo in Denver and uh, the monkey gun in his fucking cage and was howling this horrible howl and it wasn't a big cage. This monkey was screaming out like a tortured soul. It was like a man in prison, you know, let me out of the monkey was just screaming at the top of his lungs. And I was like, this is not good. Like this is not cool to do them for what? So people can stare at them. I mean that shit. She might've flown in the 19 thirties, you know, back when there was no zoos are back, there's no videos, but we have videos now, man. You don't have to put them in a zoo, you know? But,

Speaker 2:          00:06:02       but that's the only time we would ever be able to see most of those animals. That's the only thing that makes me go well, I see the reason for zoom because I'm not going to Africa and hunting down a white tiger, you know? Right.

Speaker 1:          00:06:13       Worth it for them to struggle. Just so you could stare at them.

Speaker 2:          00:06:17       Yeah. But you know, it could also be like, dude, wait, I don't have to hunt my food. There's just a stake here. Every morning when I wake up, I could sleep.

Speaker 1:          00:06:24       No, no, no. For like tigers. That shit is orgasmic to chase down an animal, chase it and move it. You ever see a cap? Like if you roll a ball, a string in front of them, they can't help themselves. Man, you should know that you have cats. Cats can't help it. They live for chasing shit, so it's just like, like you know, a guy with a hard dick lives to fuck right now. It's really the same thing, man. There it's nature rewards them for being a good Predator and I think, you know, the same way food tastes good for us and sex feels good for us. They love to kill that nature that rewards them with some crazy rush of energy and an endorphins when they kill something, you know? So you give them a cold plate of meat just pushing aluminum tray under the fucking cage. That's not the same. And that's not fun. Guaranteed, you know, but that doesn't that the killing thing bothers me. But what really bothers me is the fucking amount of room that they have to move around the kangaroo. The kangaroo cage was fucked up.

Speaker 2:          00:07:30       Have you ever read the San Diego Zoo though? That's a whole. I mean, that's what I was there. I was like, man, I would like to be an animal in this case.

Speaker 1:          00:07:37       Oh No. We went down this serious fucking deliver between what we're saying. What we're saying was that it. We got it. Okay. Um, yeah, San Diego is the shit. The way they have it as nice. They have a big giant ass place that, that makes sense. But that's fucking expensive, you know.

Speaker 2:          00:07:56       But that's how it should be. They places like the La Zoo just shouldn't exist because that's just wrong. You go to the Lsu, that's just depressing as fuck, but there is just like the Columbus state where I'm from. It's one of the biggest news Jack Hanna's from it and it's nice. They may have just acres and acres and acres of land and they,

Speaker 1:          00:08:13       you know, I don't know if they maybe throw out some goats once in a while for the Tigers or something. It just don't talk about it. And you know, they don't do that. Don't ever do that. They do that in Iraq. There's video in Iraq, have a little donkey loose and this is how they do it every day. And the dog, because just walking around eating and they open up the gate and these tigers come running out of the gate and just pick, slept at docie to the ground and fucking Jack. Um, it's really kind of wild to see. And it's really shocking. These gis filmed it when they were in Iraq at the zoo. It's, it's shocking to see. But that's really the way they're supposed to eat. Like though, that's how you should do it. If you're going to feed animals, you're going to have wild animals.

Speaker 1:          00:08:51       You should have them eat what they normally eat, man. I mean like, what's with this feeding fucking snakes. Frozen mice. Give them a fucking mouse, you know? I mean, that's what they're supposed to do. We're, we're trying to like, enforce our own ideas of, of, of morality and predation on fucking monsters. You know what I mean? Like, like a snake is a monster dude. You know, tigers. That's a monster. Those are all monsters. Their, their, their national monsters. They, there's a whole natural cycle of things. And to take them out of that, there's a, there was a kangaroo cage that was the most depressing thing because those kangaroos are just sitting there. They didn't

Speaker 2:          00:09:27       shit. There's human beings. There could be considered monster. So like if you're, if you put somebody in prison that's a mass murder, we're doing the same thing. You know, we're, we should let that mass murder go out on his way and just murder a shitload of people, you know, dumb ass logic as well. I mean, if you're saying like, you know, like a tiger that tiger or whatever, like a snake should kill its own prey and we should, you know, do what,

Speaker 1:          00:09:50       what, what? No, we're feeding them killed. Pray. We kill it first. That's what's the most ridiculous thing is that we kill what they, they eat first so that it's not as brutal for us. Somehow or another, someone else kills it. You buy it, killed, then you feed it to them. That's ridiculous. Yeah. That's not a mass murderer, dude. Mass murderers or just fucked in the head. They're not. They're not killing for food is a part of a natural cycle. They're just nuts, you know. Then when you get a naughty person, the problem is human consciousness is so more complex supposedly than animal consciousness because we have the ability to alter our environment so you can't have someone whose consciousness is haywire because that's. That's what when you have like serial killers or mass murderers will you have someone whose consciousness is just gone off the tracks and into the woods and you have just chaos and if a society is aware of itself, it has to realize that there's certain issues are going to come up when you have crazy people running around killing your family and your friends, so you got to kill them.

Speaker 1:          00:10:46       What you're supposed to do with someone like a mass murder of. You're absolutely convinced. That's the problem. Really. The problem is the court system, the court system, so fucking corrupt and so many times das and prosecutors are just trying to get a. they're just kind of trying to get a guilty verdict and they don't give a fuck if someone is guilty or not. There's many, many, many instances where cops have framed guys that were innocent. People have gone to jail for years. It turns out the DNA evidence, they were framed. I mean that's happened many, many, many. That's the real fucking problem. But if we could be absolutely sure that we knew that somebody was a mass murderer or a rapist or anyone with no remorse, who hurt other people and could hurt someone that you care, you've got to kill him. Why? Why keep them around? There's too many fucking people, you know. I mean, look, it's not like they're not going to die eventually anyway. It's not like if you don't tell them, you know, they're gonna fucking to cure cancer and live forever. No, they're not going to do anything. They're not a mass murderer is not going to contribute to society. You know, they're, they're just not. There's nothing is going to. Nothing good is going to come out of that.

Speaker 2:          00:11:44       It should just line them up and like, oh, you need a new liver? Bam. You're on death row, row. There should be no, like, you know, time period and they're going to electrocute you. They should just shoot. You. Take all the parts that they could use your corneas, are your livers best?

Speaker 1:          00:11:58       An interesting topic because there was a threat on the board and the message board on my website where people were talking about Oregon's having a memory and uh, there are all these people who have gotten transplants when people, all of a sudden they knew things that couldn't have possibly known as people who don't even know, but you know, it's like that. Yeah. I mean, I've, I've heard of many things like that where people sudden had cravings for certain types of foods and they had no idea that the. I mean, this is not just one instance. And see the thing is about memory. Like we don't know where memory is stored. Exactly. We don't. I mean, they know an incredible amount more than the average person about the way the human body works much more than people knew 100 years ago, much more than you know, even a decade ago, but they don't know everything.

Speaker 1:          00:12:44       There's a lot of questions, Matt. First of all, when human body, your cells regenerate every seven to 10 years. I think it's seven years, so literally every cell in your body changes and becomes a new one like you are. You're a new version of you every seven to 10 years. Yes. There's not the same anymore. So if that's the case, where the fuck are your memories? Because I have memories that are way more than seven years old, you know, so where the memory is stored, if you have a completely new cell, I mean are the memories like transferred back and forth between the cells when the new one is born? Is it born with the same memories? I mean, what? Where's the memory? Where's it stored? We don't fucking know. The other idea is that the memories are stored in the neurons. Well, if that's the case, because the neurons are the only thing that stay the neurons or not. You get the neurons you get or the neurons you get forever. You don't get new ones. You know, they don't regenerate every seven years, but the heart is filled with neurons. You know? It's like one of the biggest clusters of neurons in the body. It's like right up there with the brain. And I think people who have had heart transplants, I don't think it's that preposterous that they would have memories. I don't think that that's. Is that preposterous at all?

Speaker 2:          00:13:52       I think it is. And I think that that these people that say that they're having dreams stuff, they probably would have had that same exact dream with or without it.

Speaker 1:          00:13:59       Why would you say that, Brian? They're talking about things that couldn't possibly have known about people have this little girl gave up the exact identity and location of the woman. Who of the man who murdered the girl who gave her the heart. Do you know that story?

Speaker 2:          00:14:16       No, but it started there. It sounds far fetched, but it doesn't mean it's not good. There's some things that I read that when it like that, that it's kind of like to me is seeing you for. It's either somebody that wants attention, that's just dumb and they're going, no, I had my arm transplant and now I can. I'm thinking having all these dreams are people. I don't know. It's okay. That's possible. I know, I know. It's also possible that toilet, it's real. That's the problem with skepticism. What skepticism. This isn't

Speaker 1:          00:14:43       my comes to something that we don't understand. That's the problems that you know, you run the possibility of a excluding something because it seems, but the reality is we don't have enough information to decide what's rational, what's irrational. Just the idea that you have memories at all. It's fucking nuts. You know the, the idea that you can. How about the idea that you can change people's memories? You know, they say that especially like right after something shocking. If you start talking to someone and introducing new ideas to them, they'll, they'll have, they'll remember the whole situation. They'll change the whole way. They remember things like, have you ever thought of something was in some way, and then you go back and you watch the video, you're like, God damn. It wasn't like that at all. Like I had a fucking. I don't trust my memory that much.

Speaker 1:          00:15:27       I trust some things. There's some things that I know are recording in there forever for real and no doubt about it. There's some things because I've made sure that have kept that memory. Like I've had some pretty intense experiences where I made sure like I am going to make sure that I record this one, but other ones are like fucking blur man. You know, there's a lot of them that are blurring, you know, you look back on your, your high school years like Jesus Christ, it's like a slideshows and I barely remember any of it. Do you remember? Like it's getting worse and worse. I, I'm actually pretty good with a lot of weird memories. But then I, the other day I was trying to think of somebody and that I actually hung out with for three years when I was a kid and don't remember his face at all.

Speaker 1:          00:16:11       Came up with like, my sister's like, you don't remember him? We out all the time. Like I remember him but I don't know. Have any idea what he looks like. Yeah, I've had that happen to me before for sure. That's fucking weird. It is weird. It's so weird. I wonder where, where all that shit goes. Bin Smoke. Why is it that someone can pull it back though? Like someone will say something that you go, yes, and then all of a sudden, boom. The memory like blossoms in your mind. Like what is that? It's like you're given CPR to the memories. It's like they're almost dead.

Speaker 2:          00:16:40       Yeah. It's like a branch of the tree was hit and nerve of that memory was hit and it woke up that, that section of memory or whatever. Yeah. Something along those lines with. What is that? What the fuck is that? Somebody's phone. What happened? Oh Dude, you had a spider on your face. Look. Oh Shit. That's a daddy long legs. How the fuck did that get on your house? Fear factor.

Speaker 1:          00:17:13       Oh, I'm not on. I'm not on Opie and Anthony this week. It's not this week. They made a mistake. I'm there March 26th, not February 26 is the Friday, Friday before the UFC. Next Month in Dallas. This weekend. I'm not in New York this weekend, so I'm going to be at the Addison Improv, uh, this weekend, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday with my man Joey Diaz and Brian will be there as well if we get Brian drunk who might have to talk them into going on stage

Speaker 2:          00:17:47       chat. Brian

Speaker 1:          00:17:50       is actually funny comedian. He's done standup a couple of times. He did it in, uh, Atlanta. He did it. Um, what else would you do it,

Speaker 2:          00:17:58       you know, I was going to try to go up on stage before this weekend just in case if, if I get too drunk and he put me on stage, but I really, it really hurts me to go back and spend three hours of my life for like five minutes in front of two people.

Speaker 1:          00:18:13       The open mic nights, it is a grind, you know, people ask me questions all the time like, Hey, I'm thinking about doing comedy. What's the best advice? I'm like, man, you gotta be willing to put your whole life aside. You've got to be willing to do. You got to be willing to. Especially if you have a job during the day, you have a job on the day, man, your nighttime, you now, that's your social life. It's going to be standup comedy, you're going to be going to clubs and you're going to be performing and you have to do it all the time. If you don't do it all the time, you're going to forget all your material. The whatever comfort you gain on stage will be eroded very quickly. You know, it's a God damn long ask Ryan, man.

Speaker 2:          00:18:49       Yeah. I think if I was younger I would tell libby and do it, but it's really hard to be an adult and waste that much time.

Speaker 1:          00:18:54       It is, it is hard. You know, I did it. I started doing standup when I was a 21. That's how I did it right after my 21st birthday and I was, I had shit going on back then, man. You know, I mean, I was doing things. I have, you know, I had a life sort of, but it wasn't like I had a family or a mortgage or a, you know, uh, no obligations, no Internet, no obligations. You know, so it wasn't, it's hard when you have a girlfriend and you have a life and you have a life and you have children and a mortgage. Fuck man. You know, when I talked to dudes that are like 40 and they're thinking about doing comedy, I'm like, you know, okay, that's like saying I'm thinking about getting into brain surgery. When we think about brand surgery, not saying that comedy is as hard as brain surgery because it's first of all, it's not as.

Speaker 1:          00:19:45       It's not as difficult to remember all the things you need to remember with brain surgeries, but it's, it is just as difficult in a way because there was no real path. I mean you could suck as a comedian. You can't suck as a brain surgeon. You're fucking going to jail. So it's obviously a lot more discipline involved in brain surgery because you have to do it correctly, but both are equally difficult to actually fucking do and put anything in this life is difficult if you're, if you're gonna really do it. I mean, just think about if you started tomorrow and you wanted to be a computer programmer, you don't know shit about computers, you just, you're starting from scratch and you want to be a computer programmer. Fuck. Imagine the fucking work that's involved in that.

Speaker 2:          00:20:29       A lot of reading now, you know, it's a lot of reading nowadays. Like I mean you can pretty much teach myself some programming by just looking at it.

Speaker 1:          00:20:36       You know, how to type, you know about computers, you know, a lot of shit about computers, you know, a lot of shit about, about code, you know, to it, to a person that has no experience and decides I want to take on a new career. I want to be a computer programmer. I want to see code for video games. Good fucking luck man. How about I want to create video game engines. I just, I don't know where I want to be the next John Carmack. You're fucked man. You're fucked. That shit will take forever. Anything that's worth doing takes fucking forever to get good at. You know, and comedy is no different. Comedy. Music is no different. You know, I often look at people playing piano or playing guitar or something like that. I go, how cool would that be to be able to just fucking jam on the cash. But God damn, that's a lot of fucking time.

Speaker 2:          00:21:22       I've tried to learn that though. If it's, it's a, it's a coordination thing for me though, for that. That's something. Think you're just born with being able to understand, be able to coordinate each finger a certain way.

Speaker 1:          00:21:33       Well it's also cultivation. It's also if you do things like with your fingers like that early on in life, you know, it becomes much easier as you get older. They say that um, the army now is using, um, they're using xbox controllers for their drones because he's fucking kids are so used to it. Yeah. And they're encouraging people to play video games. I mean it's just a matter of time before they start record a recruiting, like the baddest motherfuckers in video games like the priority do. I mean like if you could play like war games with like a keyboard and a mouse. Like there's these dudes that play quake, like professionally, those motherfuckers can move that mouse cursor and put it on an object like instantaneously. You know, they know exactly where that cursor's going. They play so much that when they move that mouse, the mouse and the keyboard is way more accurate than that.

Speaker 1:          00:22:24       A joystick thing. The Georgia thing is kind of difficult to manipulate the like the toggles and exactly where the cross. Here it goes. But if you have a mouse you can put a mouse if you understand like how quick you know. It all depends on, you know, everybody likes a different. Some people like high sensitivity, some people like low sensitivity, but the bottom line is once you get used to whatever it is, you move the mouse, the cursor goes in a certain directions. They can put it like exactly where they want to instantly. So it's not like in you're in a helicopter, you see the insurgents, you gotta move the crosshairs and get them in line. We haven't been lying me, I'm in like, no, it's fine. I mean they could do it so fucking quick. I mean that would be some crazy shit if you could have drones and have like that guy fatality and fatality is like the baddest motherfucking quake player ever. This dude is just ridiculously accurate with his mind and a cool guy too. Met Him. Very nice guy. But if you've got that guy playing for your army and you got drones with missiles in it from that fucking guy, holy shit. You know, that's the future man. Welcome to the new world.

Speaker 2:          00:23:27       It's pretty crazy how how video games have exploded from something that used to be like, like Little Ping pongs. Now people have like amazing video games on their phones. Credible man. Just look at what you can do with your iphone playing all these different racing games and shit. We were working on the new UFC.

Speaker 1:          00:23:46       A fight game. Fuck. It's amazing man. When you watch some of the graphics and Shit, like they dive for knee bars, they get triangles, they throw head kicks and punches, flying knees and shit. You see all this crazy shit. All these different techniques they can do just like in real fighting and it's like it's so close to being like a video that you like on an actual UFC fight that you can manipulate, you know the the limit is in the controller. I think what eventually is going to happen as you're going to have a god damn suit on, you're going to have a fucking suit on or you're just gonna have this little wire plugged in on your forehead and you're just gonna think that could happen, but Microsoft is very close to developing the whole system where you interact with the game. What's it called?

Speaker 1:          00:24:28       Nitel. It comes out like I think November or it might have got pushed to spell it and in a t a l and it's pretty much just like a camera or something that sits on top of your TV and in readership motion range of motion. That's. That's incredible because that's going to be fucking cool. Imagine having like a UFC game where you could learn how to fight without actually fighting. My problem with that whole thing is I think maybe if I was a kid I would've loved it, but when I'm playing a video game like I don't want to have to be doing shit. What you say that doing with right now we just wack. It's this little thing and you're playing ping pong and it sort of moves the way you want it to. I did a week hard game once and I was like, this is not specific at all.

Speaker 1:          00:25:09       It's not. It's not rewarding. Yeah, but it's something about having to like get up. Like I want to do a lazy fuck. If I was a kid it might've been better, but like nowadays I want to play video games. I just want to sit there and smoke weed, but that's dependent on the graphics. What if the graphics were like 3d fucking super dope virtual reality type shit and you had a virtual gun and you're running down a hallway shooting at all because it's like you have a gun in your hand and it reads this gun. Come on man. That will be this shit. And the actual running that you take place, like maybe that would be the shit if you had a fucking warehouse, like a virtual reality warehouse, like you enter into the door, you put on this helmet and it's just a flat or tag.

Speaker 1:          00:25:51       Yeah. But complete three d, virtual reality, you know? Yeah. And if you get close to the walls, like a little light goes on, you are getting close to the wall. That would be good to turn. Right. You know? Yeah. Come on man. I just, I, I've just gotten to the point where I did this. Nintendo we shit just drives me crazy as boring man. The we is like playing pool, but there's no pool cue you're just going like. And you're just no feedback either feedback man. Like I want to click a button and see a gun, go off, you know, and a click the mouse button and see the rocket, you know, take off, right? That this whole moving an arm through the air that's fucking weak. That's stupid. There's this, I forget what it was. They just said the other data in the future that they're going to use, like Google maps and street view and Google maps and you're going to be playing video games.

Speaker 1:          00:26:41       Have like your street, you're going around in your house. You know what I mean? You should be able to find out if someone is playing like fucking doom on your street and rolling up your house to be like, Hey, just want you to know they should send you an email. It should be like the sims where it's like your house is the house in the video game and so like if you try to break in your house, they're trying to break into your house. Like everyone should have their own house in the video game. Yeah. That will be kind of cool. That would be correct. Then you would know where everybody, everyone lives. Killed them. Video Games have access to I for like 24 hours or something like that and you can run away. I'm kind kinda shocked. The virtual reality kind of hit like A.

Speaker 1:          00:27:22       They, they. The technology never really developed the way I thought it was going to. Like, you know, you heard about that shit like way back in the eighties and I thought wow, like there was movies based on that and I was like, I thought like wow, I remember like um, well sorta dagger. I don't remember what movie you remember. Total recall with a fucking make you could dream. Yeah, that Shit's coming. It's a total recall. What was the one with the chick with the red hair in Puerto Rico. They've already been able to take images and implant them in people's minds and they been able to read images from people's minds, like read what you're thinking about. Like you can look at something and the computer, like there's some sort of sensors that they hook up to your brain and then it sends the image to a computer and it's, it can tell what you're looking at.

Speaker 1:          00:28:09       Like that's nuts man. Because eventually, I mean this is in a very rudimentary stages of the technology where they can only pick out shapes and shit, but eventually they're going to be able to fucking see what you're seeing. That the element is that what was the ticket to red hair? And fulfillment is that the Bruce Willis movie? And it had like memories like I'm moving to the cloud, like memories in your head how, how bad ass was Chris Tucker in that moment? Remember? Who was that crazy alien? Remember? Lawnmower man was a good movie too. That's another nutty movie. But a retard. The one crazy, right? Right. Put a computer in his brain or something right now. The Stephen King Book. Stephen King. Oh No, it's strange days. Was it strange days? Was another virtual reality. Something crazy ass. I think it was strange days. Strange days. Let's go right here. Just sit here.

Speaker 1:          00:28:58       I can't wait for strategies become true if that's what it was. It was strange. That was Angela Bassett, right? She'll forever be Tina Turner. Sorry. Do any other movies. I don't. You're your Tina Turner. Um, was going to say, oh, this fucking Ms Dot Beverly Hills Chair about this. Another one of these beauty pageant checks came out saying that she doesn't believe that gays should be married. And she, she quoted Leviticus and the Old Testament saying that the, uh, you know, the Bible says that it's some stupid quote like any man who lays down with a man, as if, uh, you know, the same way lays down with a woman that's an abomination, should be put to death. So she came out and said that gays should be put to death.

Speaker 1:          00:29:45       Lucy supporting the Old Testament, which by the way, I mean, whatever you fucking want to believe about religion, that's all well and good. You know, who, who knows? If God is real, who knows? I mean, it could be that, you know, the Bible is completely ridiculous because God wants things confusing, but it gets a certain point where you read certain things and you got to go, alright, every people are full of shit. And there was no internet back then. It's not like, you know, there was a copy of the, the Bible on Wikipedia and people kept altering it. But everybody was like, no, that's not what it says. And they went back and changed it. You know, they didn't. The Old Testament, they didn't even write that fucking thing down for like a thousand years. It was just stories, you know, and the idea that those stories you can't tell, I can't tell a story to him and he tells it to his girlfriend.

Speaker 1:          00:30:34       His girlfriend writes it in her blog and it's the same story. It'll be fucked up for sure. I can't tell you how many times someone has gone to one of my gigs and I've said something and then a guy like will quote on twitter like I'll do. That was so funny last night when you said this about them, like, Tim, I didn't say that. Like you're saying something fucked up. What I said was a lot nicer, you know, but when w, when you realize that memories are so fucking, there's no way, there's no way you can be that accurate. Over a thousand years were people talking about it. And then on top of it, the original, uh, the Old Testament Bible was written in ancient Hebrew. And to this day, the only know three out of four words in ancient Hebrew, 25 percent of the words, they don't have a clue as to what they mean.

Speaker 1:          00:31:17       Not only that, letters and numbers were the same thing. Back then there were no numbers. So the letter a was also the number one. So there was like numerical value in words like the word love in the word God. They have the same numerical value in ancient Hebrew. But as soon as they translated that to Latin and Greek, that shit was all gone. Let's see. It was all lost. So for this dumb bitch to sit and think that God wants people to put, put the depth of their gay. Like this is what the Ms Beverly Hills. It's beverly. This is a new one, new Ms Dot California. And California is supposed to be so liberal. It ain't Miss Texas.

Speaker 2:          00:31:56       Do you know who Carrie Anne can't? She is or whatever her name is. She's from celebrity Rehab Niche. Can each. She was the one that had the threesome with a guy from grey's anatomy. Anyways, on this show, celebrity rehab. She. You just want to strangle her now. I think it's almost with these like pageant people, because I know a couple of these girls that did the pageants and stuff like that. They're fucked up in their head and you know, they've been doing it all their life. These little kids have grown up.

Speaker 1:          00:32:19       You remember last time? Not last time. I went to Dallas for the time before when there was that little girl pageant going on in the hotel, so you remember that. That was scary as. That was the weirdest fucking thing ever. We're hanging out the hotel and there's all these little girls. I mean little like six. Yeah, six years old with high heels and makeup on with their hair done and jewelry and dresses and you're like, what the fuck is going on here? That shit is an abomination. All right. That is a fucking. That is a travesty.

Speaker 2:          00:32:55       I feel like somebody was going wrong in the elevator because I was in an elevator with two of them and I looked at her and I'm like, oh my God, look like if they were making finger themselves in front of you,

Speaker 1:          00:33:08       something's not right there. Sometimes my daughter will play with. They're posting just other. No, I don't want to say this. That's true. I mean you were to, if you have one, but some the other day she was lying there and she had her little feet up in the air, which is rocking back and forth and she just, two hands just grabs it, you know? And uh, you know, I don't know what to say. Like, what do you say that you go, don't do that. You can't tell her not to do that. That's, you know, you don't want to suppress her and get her

Speaker 2:          00:33:31       crazy as I don't want her to be like, like in kindergarten going, hey, anybody, they all do it anyway. Dude, I got news for you. They all do it. Don't you remember doing weird shit with kids when you were a little bit. I played doctor, me and my friend played soccer with all the girls in our neighborhood and I remember the only time I remember the most, we had three girls lined up and we're like, okay, we're going to be putting pencils and your vagina's take off chance it took off other pants and we just went back to each one. Then would pull it out and smell it. And it goes, oh fuck. But we were all like, fine, you can girls lead poisoning. I know they might be retarded now because they're all on my facebook too. So totally, they're not watching what you shit. It was nice, but I thought we should ask them all questions. Does anybody remember anything about pencils? So you remember me putting up things. So in your crowd,

Speaker 1:          00:34:21       this was. So this beauty pageant thing that we saw at the hotel, it was dark. I mean it was really dark because there was all these Weirdo fucking religious people with their kids dressed like horse and made no fucking sense. I mean, no sense because there were, there were, it was, um, we were there on a Sunday and they were talking about church, there was all this church talk and you got your girl dressed as a fucking prostitute. Here's a six year old dresses, a prostitute, and you're talking about church. They had high heeled shoes on. I mean like this high, which the only reason why shoes have heels like that. And so that women's legs look longer so that guys think about them when they're pushing these long legs back and fucking the shit out of you. That's what, that's for those, that long leg thing.

Speaker 1:          00:35:06       Why, why you think? What do you think that's there for you? Sacrificing how you can walk. How about that? Just so that men want to fuck you more than we already do, which is wait, wait, what the fuck you to have sex with a girl that has her shoes on like high heels and ever got to know what is up with that though. That's just a porno stuff. That's ridiculous. I mean, I'm sure it's somewhere in my life, you know, somebody who's not, you know, taking everything off that's it's possible, but the, that someone would like that. But the whole, I don't like them in the first place. I think it was ugly and it seems to me like you're doing something stupid, you know? I don't want to be like, you're getting tricked and you don't need to do it for me. Like, you know, like my wife always wants to wear these high heels when she leaves the house.

Speaker 1:          00:35:49       I'm like, okay, if you want to do that, that's all good. But to me it seems like you can't walk right? I'd rather you wear tennis shoes, but women love them, man. They love shoes. They what they love how they look, they love. It's like how dudes love cars, you know, how you know, like you see like a 69 mustang or something like that and you go whoa. And he like pull up to a dude, look at that motherfucker. You know what I'm saying? Like there's something that men have, like women can go, wow, that's a pretty car, but it's not the same as how a dude looks at a car. Well, for girls, the shoe thing is just, they really fucking love shoes, man. Like makeup and shoes. It looks like there's the opposite sides of the body because they're so ashamed of the middle.

Speaker 3:          00:36:27       I think it bleeds. It's gross to look it up and running naturally long. It's probably something like that. Look how long my legs are and where do they go to look up there?

Speaker 1:          00:36:48       Well, the, the, the, you know, that's one thing. If you're a woman, you know, if you're a grown woman, that's what you like and what the fuck ever. Who gives a shit? You want to go pierce your balls, go do it. Who gives a shit? But for little kids that's not, that's not cool man. To have a six year old dress like a derby and it is disturbing. It felt very wrong. You know? And you know, like their whole Jon Benet Ramsey case, man, that shit disturbed that case yet. They don't know. We're going to find out the mother is still alive. I believe the moms dad died. Maybe the dad's dead too. It's possible. Anyway, no twitter verse. Yeah. Twitter versus not cool. And I agree. No, I heels are just as much an establishment as a male's ty is both are silly. That's true. That's true. Raun Kaiser. Goddamn these just twitter shit goes too fast.

Speaker 1:          00:37:43       Yeah, no, you're absolutely right. I think ties are completely ridiculous. I didn't even, I, I haven't worn a tie in a long. I did a documentary recently on Dmt and uh, well I had to wear a tie because I played like a rod sterling type narrator. It's a really interesting documentary on DMT. It'll be out sometime this spring, but I had to wear a tie. I had no idea how to tie this fucking thing. I had no idea. The last time I wore a tie was um, my, my first album grabbed that thing off the wall real quick. My first album in 1999, you know, just as a goof, one of the things I always said that I love about being a comedian is that you, you don't have to wear a fucking tie. And so just my first CD for whatever reason, I just thought it would be funny if I wore a tie.

Speaker 1:          00:38:28       It doesn't make any sense. Just look strange. I had to wear a tie for like 10 years everyday. Yeah. If you want to like work in businessman, it's like there's an agreement, like everyone has to know that you are willing to wear something completely ridiculous because you're following by the very obvious rules of behavior. It's going to be really easy to predict what you're doing. That's what people like. Like I'm a gentleman, you know, like as a gentleman, while I feel this, I'm a gentleman who's got a tie on Hello Gentlemen, Gentlemen, Gentlemen. You know, it's like there's this like this agreement that you're not going to get too crazy. You're not going to. It's like my Dr Phil Impression, you know, bottom of are showing we are very slippery. I'm not chasing after anybody, you know, it's like there's something to that. There's something to this is silly outfit that you wear that's uncomfortable.

Speaker 1:          00:39:19       Like if people started doing business and they had like rash guards on like, like road rash guards. I like, they're ready to go do Jujitsu and shit, you know, like why, why would that be bad? But it is bad. You know, you can't have like board shorts and you know what I'm saying? You know, running shoes on and you look like you're ready to pounce on people that nobody wants that in business. You can have. When you go to business you have to be dressed uncomfortable. Your button has to be all the way up here, you know, it's fucking ridiculous. You know?

Speaker 4:          00:39:48       Do, do, do, do you remember he used to work at this architect firm for my stepfather and this was when I was big into acid and stuff like that. So every time I would come to work I was either hung over a, still tripping on acid, been, you know, or something like that. It was such a boring job that it was acceptable because all that I had to do is make copies of architect plans.

Speaker 1:          00:40:09       You fucked up your brain on acid. Do you think you have fucked up your brain? Okay.

Speaker 4:          00:40:13       Um, no, no. I, I think, I think if when I was doing it, I was, yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:40:19       Was there any point that like, you know, you ever heard Howard stern talks about is acid trip know Howard stern talks about it on the radio and I guess he did like a giant dose of acid, like way too much. And uh, he was all fucked up for like a long time, like he was hearing voices and it was just like a, like a real psychotic episode and um, you know, that's a really, that's a thing about psychedelics. So you gotta make sure you don't fuck around and do too much. Like Dennis Mckenna had an experience like that to Dennis Mckenna, who's Terence Mckenna's brother. They're both famous psychonauts for psychedelic pioneers in the seventies. They went to Brazil and he took like way too much mushrooms and he lost his mind for like two weeks. Like he couldn't communicate with people, you know, and the last time I did DMT, I was fucking whacked out for like two solid weeks.

Speaker 1:          00:41:12       Not totally. You wouldn't guess if you were talking to me. I was totally normal. I did shows the shows went great. I W I went to work. I did fear fire. Did that one great. Uh, you know, nothing. Nothing got fucked up in my. But my head was like, I've felt very, you know, you feel like your consciousness is like in a foundation. Your consciousness is like, you know, like it's like boom, solid. This is me the morning you wake up in the morning, hi honey, kiss your girlfriend, brush your teeth. This is fucking solid. When I did the DMT, my consciousness was like a little tiny raft in a fucked up ocean. It's like, you know, like nothing seemed like I kept having these ideas that cars were going to come launching themselves over the boundaries and hit my car while I was driving.

Speaker 1:          00:41:58       And I'm like, I'm like, why am I thinking so Mike, what is this about? And then I realized that what it was was these are this idea of worrying about possible disasters was my ego's way of regaining ground and letting me know that it has to have a certain amount of real estate in reality and that if you want to do crazy, crazy psychedelics and go into other dimensions, communicate with entities and reevaluate your, you know, your whole position in the world. And then humankind's positioned with each other. That's all well and good, but there's some real shit in the world that the ego has to be there for. And the ego was like sending me a message. I'm dude. But if a fucking car launched itself out, you better be fucking paying attention. Like there was a certain amount of, of where it was such a mind blowing experience that there was like a wrestling match going on in my head between my ego in between this new information and accepting all this new information from the psychedelic trip and, and incorporating it into the way I look at everyday life.

Speaker 1:          00:43:00       You know. And like, you know, you think about someone who's like a real, like a shaman. You know, they're living in the jungle and they're all at peace in the world. They're not calling people douche bags on the Internet. You know, there's a certain amount of enlightenment that if you achieve it, it's going to make it very hard for you to function in the regular world and I think that's one of the most important things about psychedelic trips. Like there's a lot of cripples in the psychedelic world and then the weed world too. There's a lot of people that they're. They're so into these experiences that they can't incorporate it into their everyday life and they're almost crippled in their everyday life because of it and no psychedelic experiences worth anything. Unless you can take what you've learned from it and enhance regular life, enhance your communication with people, your relationships with people you know, enhance the way you look at the world, enhance your career path. You know the kind of friends you hang around with, unless it can enhance you. The reality is we live in this world for eight hours a day or 12 hours a day or however long you're awake. This world, this shit, this concrete world is real and you have to manage your way through this and psychedelic drugs make it very difficult to do that. If you want to have a regular job.

Speaker 4:          00:44:11       I think psychedelics, what's the main thing with psychedelics is that opens up a door and like, like in the past, like I've been offered dmt but I won't do it because I like when I first did mushrooms that opened up to a door or things I never thought of or saw before. And it's never gonna go away. It's, it didn't damage my head, but now that I know that exists, I know it's there and so when acid, the same thing, but there's a point where I have to go, okay, is this door, does this store need to be open? Is this anything positive with this door being open? And some drugs are like that for me because like a Salvia was the closest to the point where I was like, okay, that is a scary door that I opened up because that just pretty much made everything seem fake. Like, like it was like this world is fake. Everything is fake and I know that's not true, but it opened up that door where I'm like, okay, that's almost too much of a door. I shouldn't have opened up that door. I'm never going to get back. That. That thought of not knowing that was,

Speaker 1:          00:45:04       that's pretty more pretty much saying the same thing. It may if you can't bring it back and incorporated into your everyday life and like sometimes you open up these doors, you're like, the fuck am I going to do with this in your everyday life is just whacked out. Some people like going back to that, that fake world so much though, and that's where it gets fucking scared. You know what I think most of those people, their real world is not so hot, you know? And that's one of the reasons why it becomes an escape, you know? And I don't think it should be an escape. I don't think you should ever escape reality. You're here. This is, this is life. You know, there's life can be magical. Fucking intense, fantastic experience if you manage it correctly. But if you just want to escape all the time, I've got to think that you're probably fucking up in this life and that's imbalanced.

Speaker 1:          00:45:50       You know the people that always want to go. And it's like, like the same thing with like video games. I remember I told you about this dude. There's this dude who used to be a manager at the comedy store that was addicted to everquest. Just completely addicted. Eight, 10, 12 hours a day, lost everything, lost his job, lost his life. He just was so pale you would see him. He was so pale, looked like he never saw sunlight, like he would order in food and never leave the fucking house for days. And he came down to the comedy store one night. And then of those, it's so weird. I'm so good at making money in my online life and so bad in my real life. It was starting to realize that like he's a fucking loser in this life because he's. He's excited and puts all of his passion and energy into this other life.

Speaker 1:          00:46:36       But that's just really because this other life is a new and exciting thing. You know, a new and artificial thing and he can control it from his computer without dealing with emotions and dealing with all the, you know, the fears and anxieties and the real world presents. But the reality is if we live the life in a computer screen and we were offered the real world as a video game, the real world will be so much more fantastic. You know, we just don't think of it as being fantastic because we're so goddamn used to it. You know, if we lived life in a computer, in a computer monitor and that's how you were when you were born. And then one day someone said, you know, hey, we've developed this new game that allows you to go outside and you go outside and you'd actually get laid and they can go and have a real drink and you feel it.

Speaker 1:          00:47:19       You do a real shot of Jack Daniels would go, Holy Shit, this is real. I can't believe it. You know, you'd go get laid for real and you drive a car for rail. You'd really like to the world stuff, fucking shit. You would never want to play video games. The reason why we want to play video games is because it's a world that we can control completely independent from all the, the, the, the like the pros and cons of this solid world, completely independent of the emotions and the insecurities and all the shit that we all experience but we don't like, but the reason why we experienced insecurities and anxiety and anger, these are all like little chemical signals to guide you through towards a proper life. Like when I've found in life, most importantly more than anything is that the one, the way that I'm the most happiest is if I'm putting out positive energy.

Speaker 1:          00:48:09       I'm putting out positive energy to people, two friends, positive energy on stage, positive energy with my writing and my work with, with anything I'm doing, it's all friendly and positive and happy, and if you do that, you know you can. You can have a fucking fantastic life. The problem is it's just difficult to do. It's hard to keep your shit together. It's hard not to lose your temper. It's hard not to be obsessed with something and get sidetracked and that's where like gambling addictions and masturbation addictions and all that shit, that's what that's all about. It's like you're trying to distract yourself from, from all the pain of being a human, you know? I mean, I think fucking hunter s Thompson had a quote like that, like a man making himself a beast to, to get away from the pain of being a man. I forget exactly what the quote was, but something along those lines, like we distract the shit of ourselves because the game of life is fucking hard to do.

Speaker 1:          00:49:02       It's just like a video game is hard to do. You know, you remember like back when I used to play quake like all the time I played quake like hours and hours a day and you and I played quake online. We played against each other and like you can tell the difference between someone who's playing all the time because you, you, you get really good at it. You know, you know where the rockets are going to go. And I was sticking rail guns up your ass and electric. I think you want 120 games. And I won one. Maybe not, hopefully not fair. And like. And believe me, there's dudes online that would do that to me. Just raped me. Why? Because they had put so much time in this fucking crazy game. They would get good at it. But since you hadn't put time, how frustrating was it?

Speaker 1:          00:49:39       So she didn't want to play right now I'm want to shut it off. Yeah, that's exactly the same as life. If you get good at life with the game, then it's fun as fuck. It's awesome. You know, if you're Leonardo Dicaprio, life must be the shit. You know what I'm saying? He started in movies driving a Ferrari for models. What? He's got a gigantic fucking mansion. I mean he's a, he's a movie. Had been. Must be so fun for him. But not everybody can be Leonardo Dicaprio. So if you're the fucking garbage man who's, you know, came home and his wife is fucking the newspaper Guy. You know, that's not a fun life. That's a, that's, that's just like a guy who's not good at quick getting murdered in a game. It's not fun, man. It's like playing pool. If you're good. Like I played pool, I love pull up, I get obsessed with it, but I have a friend, my friend Max eberly, he's a professional and he's a top professional.

Speaker 1:          00:50:31       I mean he's capable of winning when he's in stroke, capable of winning any tournament in the world. I mean he's really fucking good and when I play against him sometimes it's so frustrating and I played pretty good. Like for a regular person I played good but for like a pro, not even fucking close. So when I play Max it's just getting my ass handed to me it's just getting fucked. The only time it's fun is when we play on a really, really tight table, so occasion when he misses and then I'd be like, oh, I get to shoot, you know? So he's much better at that game. We used to give him a handicap. Sorry, sorry. Well we know, we just, we don't play for anything. It's good for me. It's good for me because you get used to playing against a guy like that.

Speaker 1:          00:51:10       It's not as fun as playing against a guy who's like your speed, but it's really good for your game because it makes sure that you capitalize on every mistake. Sometimes you'll play a guy who's not as good as you and you're like, I don't worry about this because, uh, if I miss this guys gonna Miss, and I'll have another shot with Max. Every time you miss, you're like, fuck, I better, I better sit down for awhile. Anyway, I believe that I'm. The hunter asked quote is actually from Samuel Johnson and English author. Thank you very much sir. I thought it was 100 thompson quote. Thank you. Cj. Mic L Hiney mcelhinney. It's what about words and names like Swartz and anger. How the fuck did that ever get through? Like what culture ran out of sounds? People string together. Something nutty like that. People that like to write in cursive is that is going to be the best cursive writing I've ever seen.

Speaker 1:          00:52:04       Manuscripts. Slaves to write it on a page and they didn't have lines in the paper. They just had paper and they would write it. Exactly. Have you ever heard of the Voynich manuscript? The voynich manuscript? I don't know if I'm saying it right, is this ancient manuscript that was a found a ton, hundreds, hundreds of years old and they have no fucking idea what it says. They don't know the language covered under any. Think about it. They don't know if it's just nonsense. If some guy was just practicing scribble, but it's like really long and it's A. Yeah, and his consistency in how it's written, but they can't decode it. They've had like top encryption experts and it's like it's very divided. Some people believe it's a hoax and some people believe that it's some fucking lost language and some people think that it's gloss gloss of Lelea, like when someone talks in tongues and that they just went into a fucking trans.

Speaker 1:          00:52:54       Some retired with a pennant now because it's got really good writing. It's got diagrams in it and really good, really good illustrations rather and diagrams and it's like a weird. Yeah, it's really complicated, you know, and they found that uh, that temple and Turkey that is 7,000 years older than the Pyramids are very complex stone temple carved out of stone and shit and now they have to like rewrite, like human history because like 7,000 years before Egypt has 9,000, 10,000 BC and 10,000 BC, they were already like had temples and we're worshiping shit. And like that throws a monkey wrench into the whole gears of, of the, the, the idea of a cultural evolution, you know. And there's this been this Guy John Anthony West, John Anthony West, look that up on Google because this guy is fascinating. He's got an awesome DVD series called magical Egypt and this guy is obsessed with Egypt.

Speaker 1:          00:53:47       He spent his entire life studying Egypt and he believes that the Egyptian culture goes back way, way, way before the established timelines. Like the established timelines for Egyptian culture is like 2,500 BC. That's when they think like the pyramids were built and that the culture goes back a little bit before that, but not much. And he thinks it goes back like 35,000 years, he thinks that people have been around way, way longer and that there was some big break somewhere along the line, like probably some sort of a natural cataclysmic disaster, like a meteor impact or something like that, you know, and it could be, you know, 10,000, 15,000 years ago, like they don't know when it was, but they think that there was like an advanced culture and then boom, it got fucked up and then culture rebuilds, society rebuilds and then what's left is like they're living in the shit that was made thousands and thousands of years ago and they tried to imitate it and recreate it and they can't.

Speaker 1:          00:54:39       And he believes that that's what it is. Like these, these fucked up here, man. So they have in Egypt. It's not that these pyramids were like the first pyramids, he thinks much, much more likely. These pyramids were probably like, people were like trying to duplicate other shit, duplicate shit that was already there. You know, they believe that that's don't actually, that's not his theory. That's someone else's theory. His theory is I'm, one of the things is about the Sphinx. They brought in geologists, the geologists have like documented the erosion on the sphinx and they say there's water or roadnet like thousands of years of rainfall, of cut deep fissures in the whole entire enclosure with a sphinxes. And the problem with that is the last time there was rainfall in the Nile Valley was like $709,000 BC. So that would mean that the, the, the, the Pyramids and the Sphinx rather would have to be like 7,000 years older than the established timeline.

Speaker 1:          00:55:30       And so of course, none of the, uh, the egyptologists like the guys who have been teaching forever, that the Pyramids and the Sphinx and all that was built about 2,500 BC. They never want. They don't want to accept it. They go, well, where's the evidence for this culture? Like, it's right there, man. There's fucking rainfall for thousands of years have created this. And geologists are universal about that. There's no one is disputing that. The geologists are all saying he's got hung. This guy ron shock, who's a, uh, I'm a professor at Boston University, has got over 100 professional, uh, professors geologists to sign off on the fact that this is undoubtedly water erosion, which completely changes the timeline for when the, the, uh, the Sphinx was built and there's a bunch of that shit going on in, in Egypt. They believe that it's like probably, you know, maybe even 30,000 years old, there's a mass extinction took place on the earth somewhere around 10,000 years ago.

Speaker 1:          00:56:27       And uh, that's when the woolly mammoth died instantaneously. That's when the saber tooth tigers died. Noah's Ark now this before, but the, the um, like 10,000 years ago, North America, like half of North America was under a mile high sheet of ice. Like there was an ice age going on and something killed it and ended it like instantaneously and they don't know what it was. And it's very, very likely that it was a fucking natural disaster. It's very likely that it was a fucking meat here impacted some what happened. That guys are distracting the shit out of me. So I don't look at me, well, don't fucking have a monitor open in front of me, Dude Surf and he's not even paying attention. We do one week podcast. This dude is so addicted to the Internet. He can't even talk for one week. I've heard you talk before, you've heard me talk about this is online, dude, there's 675 people, but have not heard this story. Don't look at him. Shut up, faggot.

Speaker 1:          00:57:21       Anyway, I think people have been around way longer. I think it's much more likely that it's just really ridiculous that people still don't believe in and how long this world's been around. You know what I mean? Oh, like people have believed the earth, 10,000 years old. It just drives me crazy. Well, you know, that's how not monster number more than 50 percent of America, according to a Gallup poll, which is not the same because I'm the. Here's the thing about poles. You can't say like according to a recent poll, 50 percent of Americans believe this because, no, no. According to your recent poll, 50 percent of Americans who are fucking retarded enough to answer your poll, believe in that. That's the reality of polls are never representative of anybody intelligent because you can't get me to answer a fucking pole. We can't get you. You got shit to do.

Speaker 1:          00:58:08       Don't you have a hobby? You hear somebody calls you. May I have five minutes of your time? No, that's for like old ladies who have no friends. So that's what that is. A mom. Look at this glitter more. I'm fucking super baked and I just don't want to hang up from a person and I'm like, I'm okay. Five minutes. Okay. I'm trying to be nice. But the reality is polls. Polls represent the retards. You know, you're, you're, you're, you're a fucking, you're a dollar. You're answering polls. Goddammit. Anytime I do a poll as if I think I'm going to win something, if I answer, 20 percent of Americans can't fund the United States on a globe. Is that True Joe? Beef don't be lying. Job is line job. If it didn't make that shit up. Solar flares up in 2012, bro. We're clashing the galactic equator than you know what?

Speaker 1:          00:58:54       You know, there's a guy which is Richard Tyson. Is that his name as a. What is that guy's name? The astronomer. Really? Neil Tyson. Neil Tyson. Very, very intelligent guy and I really like listening to them talk and one of the things he said about this whole crossing the aquatic whatever. What is it? What is the exact way this guy, galactic equator. I think that's what this guy said. I'm the. Yeah, like we're crossing the center of the galaxy. We were. Everything's in line on December 21st 2012. You know what he says? He says that happens all the time. Says he says that like that, like line up with the center of the galaxy. That's it doesn't, it doesn't happen then because goes, it happens all the time and nothing happens. So who knows if he's right or if he's one of those guys. It's like super skeptical, but I think what's much more likely it's going to happen in 2012 or something technological.

Speaker 1:          00:59:48       Something technological, some crazy invention, you know, like I don't think it be anything. It could be that too. It could be that 2012. What really happens is nothing happens and then people realize, oh, we have to actually manage this life. We can't just rely on fucking aliens landing. I was more scared about 2000 just because if that makes sense. All the computers, planes dropping from the sky. I was scared to. I didn't. Um, I didn't do a Gig in 2000. I stayed home. I thought for sure there was at least going to be something small when thousand dollars. Isn't it crazy that that's 10 years ago now. Time is just fucking flying by man. It's crazy fast. Too Weird. It almost feels like it's quicker every year and everybody says that. But what time really is quicker would if like clocks are moving quicker to. We just can't really establish it because that wouldn't make sense because what about digital clocks?

Speaker 1:          01:00:41       They all exist in, in this fucking dimension. Maybe there's a dimension is moving quicker. Units of timer know almost. I think we're forgetting more so it feels like we're forgetting more than the day because we have more information. Maybe thoughts on those guys movement, you know, what I think about zeitgeists and all that stuff. There's a lot of. It's poorly researched like the stuff that he said about Mithra and different, different gods and stuff that, that are just like Jesus loved was really poorly researched and incorrect and been proven wrong. There's a website that says, uh, I think it's a common debunkings I guys or something like that. I forget what the, uh, what the website is titled, but I mean the guy just breaks down all the errors that the dude who made the movie made and it's just, you know, he's, he's quoting references and showing very clearly that, uh, the, the guys guys made some big problem, big, big fuck ups and I think his whole, how sure he is.

Speaker 1:          01:01:50       That's September 11th was, was, um, designed and the, you know, the uh, and perpetrated by the US government and that tower one tower two fell because they were, there were detonated. Like, you're sure that, you know, look, no one's sure that that's crazy. You can't say free spot. Now. All this talk of free fall speed and the towers fell at free. Fall speed. Yeah, they fell pretty fucking fast. But that's what happens when shit falls apart, it falls apart pretty fucking fast, especially shit that's super heavy and gigantic and all that weight is on and it's all just collapsing. Who the fuck knows what happens when you build a building that way and you fly a fucking giant plane filled with jet fuel into it. The only way to really know. I mean you can have theories, but the only way to really know is to build another building and fly another jet into exactly the same way and see what happens and if it falls down exactly like that one, then the argument's pretty much over.

Speaker 1:          01:02:44       And if it doesn't then you have to go, well, okay, well what was inside the building? Did it all burn the same was a, was it exactly constructed the same? You know, and then you got to try it again. I mean, you have to have more than two buildings to go on and everybody's like buildings I've never fallen before and the government does some nasty evil shit. That is absolutely a fact, but you don't know. You don't know what happened there. And to say that you know is just as bad as people who blindly trust in the US government. The thing that question that I have a big question about when it comes to September 11th is tower seven and if you watch video online, there's video of tower seven falling and it falls just like a controlled demolition. I mean it just goes straight down all at once and it's, it's really crazy to watch man, you know, because like it implodes from the basement down in every level falls apart including like jets of, of energy, like spraying out of windows.

Speaker 1:          01:03:39       Like there's blasts. I mean maybe that could be because it's collapsing. I mean that's a whole floor of error being registered. That one. But the problem is it all falls the exact same time in that building wasn't even hit by a plane. It was on fire and it had a whole minute from like debris and stuff and I could see it falling down, but there was a hole in one corner and the whole, if it's a hole there and the building's going to collapse when it collapsed towards the whole. I mean, doesn't that make sense?

Speaker 4:          01:04:03       Maybe the. It also makes sense. The whole poc, standing on a pop can thing. Wherever you stand on a pop, can you knock a little bit off the side? It's not, you're not falling over, you're going straight down the wave. You know, meaning it's so heavy. Even if there's a hole on it, it doesn't matter. It's just going straight down and that's maybe, maybe I, I think with all that shit, I'm like, yeah, I'm glad there's people that freak out about and care about it because without them, you know, the government's going to get away with a bunch of shit. But in my opinion, you know, I don't care if the government didn't fuck they did it, you know, I'm still waking up eating cereal.

Speaker 1:          01:04:35       Well that is one thing you have to consider. I mean, it's like you, you, you mean, how is this going to help you? How's this going to help you in your life? I know if you get obsessed with this much tears, here's the bottom line people to think the government wouldn't kill people and nobody died and tower seven supposedly, but the people don't believe people think the government would not kill people. This is all you need to know for sure. They start wars. Then don't need to be started. That's 100 percent fact for sure. The Gulf of Tonkin incident that got us into the Vietnam war, that was a fake fucking attack on Americans. They faked it and they faked it and made this big deal about it so that everybody would get fired up and realize we have to go to Vietnam. That's fact. This is history. You know, and the fact that they wrote up a thing called operation northwoods.

Speaker 1:          01:05:21       The northwoods document in the northwoods document was they were planning attacks on Americans and they were going to. This is in 1962 and they were going, this was signed by the Joint Chiefs of Staff. By the way, and vetoed by Kennedy, they were going to attack one time, obey there. We're going to lob grenades into and mortars and to Guantanamo Bay and possibly kill American soldiers. They were going to blow up a jetliner and blame it on the Cubans and they were going to tell Americans, we have to go to war with Cuba. Well, people are going to fucking die in a war for sure and people are going to die in a war that Americans didn't want. And so they decided to do what's called a false flag and make attacks on Americans and blame it on the Cubans and that's a fact. They're willing to kill people. And only 3000 people died in September 11 for sure. That's a lot of people. I'm not making light of it, but think comparison to how many people have died in Iraq during the fucking war. They're talking about like a million civilians have died in Iraq since the invasion. A million. I mean, that's fucking right.

Speaker 2:          01:06:19       Haiti. I mean millions of people die from that earthquake in Haiti, but we didn't have it. Hd video fucking, you know. Seeing it, yeah, but we didn't. We're not responsible for that. No, no, no. I know, but I think the reason why is that they're willing to kill people. Right, right. I think the reason why we were focused on it though, it's just because of that, that we all watched it live where, you know, if we saw these people in a racket shot, live on tv would probably be just as big as nine slash 11. You now.

Speaker 1:          01:06:46       Well, I don't know about that. You know, I think, I think. Well I think the idea was it was an attack on American soil. I mean that's really what was such a big deal. And then all mean. I remember how everybody gets so patriotic after afterwards. Do you remember after September 11th, everybody had fucking American flags on their car. Remember that weird feeling? You were you still in Ohio back then? Right? Right. Did they have them in Ohio? It was crazy bad. I left, I went to work one day. I don't even think I was doing fear factor at the time. I might've been, but I was driving down down the street near my house and every fucking car had an American flag on it. It was crazy and I was like, this is just weird. It's a weird feeling. It's like, like people are blowing up, like they're ready to just go to fucking war.

Speaker 1:          01:07:31       You don't realize like how war, like this fucking culture really is and, and how sheep like and how people would just immediately willing to fight and fight who don't. The people who did it are dead. I think it was a suicide attack. So the people that were responsible for the deaths of those people are all dead. I mean, unless you're one of those crazy motherfuckers that doesn't believe that it was a real plane. And then. And then there's people that believe that they were piloted by remote control on the planes were emptying. Who the fuck knows shit happened. Almost wait is this almost 10 years, 10 years, and I'm still talking about it. Oh my God. It's so frustrating talking to people who claim to know. That's when it's really frustrating, man. It wasn't a plane hit the Pentagon. It was a missile, whereas all the people that died in the fucking plane crash then did they.

Speaker 1:          01:08:16       They took them. And why would they say it's a plane? Why would they shoot a missile and say it's a plane. Why we're there. All the plane parts on the lawn. I mean, come on, man. You're talking about this before this the plane. Can we actually last week or two weeks ago? It's fear factor real. Nothing is real. Depends on how much acid you take. Joe Rogan hates Bruce springsteen is so not true. It's not true. You're just trying to get attention, motherfucker. No. Hey Bruce springsteen born to run. That's a great fucking brilliant disguise. That's a great fucking song. Do I don't love all bruce springsteen. I'm not going to sit through a three hour concert of anybody's. It would have to be like Richard Pryor would have to come back from the dead. And Floyd do three. I might sit through three hours of pink Floyd's. No, I wouldn't.

Speaker 1:          01:08:58       I'd get bored. They don't have three hours of good songs, but. But I love some, some, uh, Bruce springsteen songs? No. Some of them are the fucking shit. No one is gonna like I bought an old rolling stone album the other day because it had one song on it that I really liked. I forgot what it was, but the rest of the album was dog shit. And that's the rolling stones. You know, you think about how many great songs they have. They have a lot of fucking albums, you know, if you go back into some of those older albums and listen to some of those songs that you don't know shit, you know, not now. Nobody puts out something that everybody loves, you know? And if I like, I mean it's very rare that I like a whole album from a band are real orangey, like with more than 10 people having sex in the same room.

Speaker 1:          01:09:40       It's like you walk in and you're like, what the fuck is going on here at origin? Yanik? A real unknown. I've never been on religion of, you know, I, I just, it seems like Tampa, Tampa, Florida. So when I was trying to get us to go to a sex club, whereas he got, had a swingers club that happened again with me and Ari in, um, I think it was Nashville, me and already we're in Nashville. We had a saint. This driver who drove us to the UFC, drove us to the comedy club, the same driver all week and then filing. He's dropping us off at the airport and he's like, as he's dropping us off, I was like, well, if you're ever back in town, no, I have a fucking swingers club that I belonged to me. And I go, what? And it was a swingers. Like, yeah, me and my wife were swingers.

Speaker 1:          01:10:20       Swingers. So you let dudes fuck your wife who's like, well, you know, she lets me and I have to let her. What will we get to choose though? We have veto power. That's what we said. We got veto power like I go. So if some dude, you feel like you can't follow them. Oh yeah. No, no, no, no, no big young studs. Like he's getting old bald fucking vacuum salesman. Band is wide mouth. I'm like, do watch. He goes down, I don't want to watch. You don't want to watch, you don't want to watch your, your wife is getting fucking stuffed in another room. How crazy is that bitch? You know how crazy it she, you know, whenever I hear about chicks that want to fuck like a bunch of different dudes at the same time like that. Is there something. I mean, look, we're all wired differently and you know, I like hot sauce.

Speaker 1:          01:11:05       You like hot sauce, like spicy food. I like really spicy food. Like I fucked myself up. I bought like Dave's insanity sauce on, on Burritos and I'm sweating. Pouring sweat is pouring down my face, my tongue is on fire now. The most people they wouldn't like that. But I liked that for some weird reason. Maybe some girls just like Dixon everywhere, you know? And maybe they like it. Maybe it's just like they're just going crazy. Maybe it's not, but maybe maybe they're broken, you know, it depends on the person. Some of them are for sure fucked up. There was this girl on the Howard Stern show Saturday night got fuck so hard in the ass that it tore a hole in her intestines.

Speaker 1:          01:11:45       It's. He sewed it back up and then she was talking about how she's just the other day had to dixon her ass. I'm like, what didn't you once your intestines rip open? My God, what is this girl? She's in the New Jersey Shore Porn Jersey whore or something like that. Someone who knows. You guys know there's a bunch of you fucking perverts. Goddammit. You people know who it is. I forget her name, theresa or something like that, or whoever was listening to the stern show today and I heard that. Yeah, Mr Han's, that sounds just like Mr Hanson, but that, that a regular Dick doing that too is that's even more impressive. The Horse Dick. You look at it and you go, how does it not kill you? The most amazing thing about that Mr Han's thing, if you don't know what Mr Hans's, so the guy who got fucked to death by a horse and there's a video of it online, you can watch the guy getting fucked by the horse, but the amazing thing is Tom, they did it tear and Thomas.

Speaker 1:          01:12:37       Beautiful. Thank you very much, Marty Hubris. You fucking pervert. But I'm. The amazing thing about the horse fucking video is that apparently this guy had gotten fucked by a horse a bunch of times and nothing happened. Like he was okay. Like how's that even happened? Mr Hans is year nine slash 11. You talk about that shit every day, you know? Is there a. is there a point where you're like, man, I do talk about fucking horse found a whole lot more than I know because it's a bit of my back, but no, it's like part of my job. You remember that Shit. The face I used to go behind you and always make the faces all the time. Well, I found myself doing it on normal faces, so like it'd be my mom, like, hey mom, let's take a photo and then back and I'm like, Oh, I'm doing this all the time.

Speaker 1:          01:13:19       Now I have to stop. So that's why I stopped in the face because it was something that was like in my head. If you don't know what faces, and this is a thing that went on for literally like five years. Every time I took a picture with someone like, you know, someone came to a show and they want to take a picture with me. Every time Brian was behind them like this and there's, we have to organize them and put them on, on my space. But a lot of them are. But the other one of them, we're talking about no bullshit. Five years worth of shows. Thousands and thousands and thousands and thousands of pictures. All with Brian behind it making crazy fucking faces. I have a picture of me and David Lee Roth and you're behind it. You're going to fuck though. I think the last one I did or the one that made me realize I need to stop doing it, but when I did the brock lesnar and I was so drunk and then next day and I'm like with them, I did not do it with Brock Lesnar did with Dana Cookman oh yeah. And I did to take tank,

Speaker 2:          01:14:13       but no, the brock lesnar one, like I was like, oh I need to stop. He could've easily kicked my ass right then and oh my God, I, I don't have that picture. You've got to send that to me. I'm going to put this up. All right. That's awesome. I'm going to do it right now because. Wow, I've never seen that photo before

Speaker 1:          01:14:28       or I'll put that shit up and put it on flicker. Okay.

Speaker 2:          01:14:33       I do whatever I. I can't believe I bought David Lee Roth. I can't wait to. Well No, I shouldn't say this, but I can't wait to one day where David Lee rocked

Speaker 1:          01:14:45       won't

Speaker 2:          01:14:46       be around. Maybe so we can release that video or you won't be at this video of us all hanging out with David Lee Roth. I don't mean die, I mean like he doesn't kill him to say about it right now because he told us not to talk about it. Oh, all right. I mean he doesn't want the video coming out. So the last thing we should do is talk about what's on the video. I just say we all sat around and talked, but we love bullshit, man. You were saying you can't wait until he dies. You can release it and then then just so we can show it to people because it was so awesome. It was awesome. Yeah. Right?

Speaker 1:          01:15:19       Yes, it was, it was, it was just cool talking to him. It was basically just David Lee Roth talking about crazy road stories and there's nothing scandalous. It was just a mean fucking David Lee Roth, you know? It's just weird hanging out with somebody that you grew up as a kid listening to his albums at gold circle and yeah, it's amazing. Hanging out with David Lee Roth was a shit. All right, hold on. I'm going to choose the photo. We'll put that shit online. So. Yeah. But this, this picture of Brian Going nutty behind David Lee Roth is just indicative of one of fucking.
