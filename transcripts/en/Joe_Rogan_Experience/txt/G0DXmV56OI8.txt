Speaker 1:          00:00          Hello Freak bitches. I think we will become incredibly annoying spammers of ourselves. That's what we're going to do. We're going to be able to download ourselves. Then we're just going to fucking shoot ourselves in the bit torrent and mega upload. We're going to put ourselves everywhere. Like I want to go everywhere. I want to go to fucking Europe, I want to be in Turkey and there'd be doubles and triples of people all throughout the the this, this artificial world that we've created of hyperspace. We're going to have like a hyper space cloud drive of humanity that's going to be just as fucking crowded as earth and we're going to go shit, we don't have enough hard drive space and the fucking cloud and these assholes keep copying themselves cause they want to be a mortal. So like rich guys would have like a cloud serve reflect 200 trillion terabytes and it would just be filled with copies of themselves and then they would just send out fucking like fake emails. Click here to see some Dick. Whoa, I want to see some Dick. And you click that, boom. He, it's an exploit. It gets into your server. Bang. Makes copies of himself everywhere.

Speaker 2:          01:01          Yeah. You'll be able to like get Joe Rogan in your cars. Your car has your brain in all your, your past and all your memories, but your cars talking to you and it's due. It's like you're my bro.

Speaker 1:          01:13          Imagine if they figure out a way to not just download your consciousness but take parts out you don't need. Yeah. Like take parts out that you don't need, like your ego. Take the ego out and have, have this consciousness be completely compliant. We figured out a way to isolate the ego. We're going to remove it and we're going to put this brain in cars so he get in your car and you're talking to you, but you don't have your own ego. We go, hey man, I fucking, I want to have a say or where we drive. You can't have that shit coming out of your car like your car has to be completely compliant. Right. That's how I drive. I don't, I don't take advice from my fucking car. I'm driving bitch relaxed. But if you could download your consciousness, your own conscious in your car, your car would be literally an extension of you. And the car thinks it's you. Yeah, it's card. Totally thinks it's you. I can't see. Well the card, the card knows that you and it or one. And then when you're together you're the same. But his, his legs place in life is to be your car.

Speaker 2:          02:14          It's so fucked up. And you can start downloading you and everything so you could download you in the toilet microwave. You just have little Joe Rogan. Like who thinks it's a real person? Yeah, we'll get invaded. You would get like, someone would break your door to obtain Dong. You open the door a million bill burrs compiling your house. There's someone decided to just copy bill burr and put all the bill birth files out into the Internet. You have to kill them all because you don't want to a bunch of bill burrs talking all day. So you have to be like, I'm sorry, Bill Byrd, toaster. Well going to kill you. And they would be like, wolves. They're really

Speaker 1:          02:46          cool. But you have to control the numbers. You know that many of any of us, imagine if there's 100 million Jamie vernors you would go listen dude enough, it's too many of you fuckers. If people don't think about that shit man, if it's possible to download consciousness is possible to copy it. If it's possible to copy it, it's possible. Spam it. In that sense, your history is really kind of fucked up and weird when you, if you approach it with them through a moral lens because you see so many nasty seeing steck place and in the weird ones are the ones where there really is no good solution where you don't know what the healthy thing would be like. There's one that I was researching flora and he's three on fire maybe a year from now or something. I was he searching the story from the 1980 [inaudible] in El Salvador.

Speaker 1:          03:34          At that time there was a right wing government in El Salvador. De was government was supporting and there was a leftist Galleria. There was in the logic of the Cold War, there are only two options. You're read pro communist story. Our [inaudible]. There's nothing in between, right? So in the process of fighting is left is gonorrhea. The government of El Salvador is doing nasty sayings, right? Anybody will criticize them, doesn't matter whether they are communist or not. Get tortured to death, chop off their bodies. We'll leave them in the middle of the street. American Congress at that point, cause I go, shit, you know it can't really keep sending millions of dollars to, these guys were doing horrible human rights violations. So they passed these low that in order for any more aid to be sent to the governor of El Salvador, the president of the United States, to sign off on a document stating that these guys have made huge improvements in their human rights record, that they're on the right path.

Speaker 1:          04:24          You know it's getting better. Problem is the deadline is coming up that Reagan is each into be able to send out all these millions of dollars to do the government of El Salvador. And in the moment a Salvadorian army cous on these offensive against the Galleria. They find some villages that chest wanted to be left the fuck alone. They were not pro communist, but they are not anticommunist either. They were like bunch of Evangelical Christianity peasants who just wanted to farm their fields and be left alone. So he, they would lead the communist, go through, they will add the army, go through a figure. If we stay neutral, everything works out right. While not in the core door and the Cold War, there is no neutrality are either on one side or the other. So Salvadorian army come in and grab every single villagers, separate demand from the women keelhaul demand or April.

Speaker 1:          05:10          The women don't kill them all, kill everybody in that village and New York Times. The New York Times did an article on it and um, and uh, Reagan was like, Oh shit, what do I do now? So he said, the guy who wrote this article is some crazy communists. None of these is through. It's a smear campaign against our allies. The government of El Salvador has made huge improvements. I'm sending the millions of dollars of course, years down the road or south of the original story. It was through that the staff did that pen and but other than bitching about Reagan, this is not even an anti Reagan thing is that it's a messy situation because you do support the government of El Salvador. He are literally supporting death squads, child rapists. I mean it doesn't really get any worse than that. You don't support them. There's a chance that so hard when the recruiter turn into a communist state, in which case he's not exactly what communism around the world as a high reputation for human rights.

Speaker 1:          06:05          It's fucking awful. Right. So he's like, what do you choose? You know the, you choose to support them or do you choose? It's like how do you see where I'm going? Like it's a situation where no matter what you choose, you're fucked. You're doing bad things. But clearly the moment you're supporting that squads, that cannot be the right solution. Not that, but at the same time, what is the right solution? What is there good thing you should do? You know Carter at the same exact proper, you know right before Reagan Carter, some guide yard, she'd be shipped off El Salvador. This guy, Oscar Romero, San Te maillet there, saints top fucking sandy money to my government because they are doing horrible syncs with it cart. I was like, Eh, I don't want to look at this because this is politically traveling for me. So two weeks later that's squats walking into the main church in El Salvador. This guy was celebrating mass. They gunned him down, kill them. So it's not a Republican or democratic thing, you know it's like both sides of the game. They are did not know how to handle this in a situation where it's like which mass murders do we support and which ones do we oppose? Cause that's the reality of it. It was like there are the stories or like what? What

Speaker 3:          07:14          the fuck do you do? Yeah, I would imagine and probably last a long ass time too long time. It's a long day at the beach. It was probably a couple solid hours of visions then right? With that kind of dose. Yeah. On and off. There were some, yeah, there. I kept seeing initially I kept seeing a like this, like a group of people like Kinda eyeball on us. I was thinking like, I think it is take our shit. Like are they going to try to steal or am I going to have to fight someone? Like this doesn't, this is weird and this is a place not a lot of people go to. And I kept seeing that and then I had to take a deep breath, like Tosca, like feel me, you know, feel like my energy. She could feel what's going on. She's like, are you okay? I'm like, ah, somebody kind of come.

Speaker 3:          07:58          It's like, no, what are you, what are you talking about? And she's like, planes, fucking sea turtle bugs and shit, whatever. You know, like she's just, she doesn't have it, you know, and she's looking over at me and am I okay? And she's like, seriously, you're fine, don't worry, you're fine. I was like, okay. And I put my head back down and I kept seeing it done. Like this young kid kind of comes through the crowd, like he's going to challenge me and he walks down. I'm like, Oh fuck, I got to defend us. I've got to fight and I know how fucked up I am. I can't believe we have to defend myself. And I'm like, it's playing out in my mind all the ways that I'm going to have to fight this guy. And I realized right then like I stand up open.

Speaker 3:          08:31          My was like, oh fuck, it's just a vision. And I was like, Heart's racing. I'm like, why would I think that? And then I realized every fucking day of my life since I was a little kid, I play that out. Anytime someone gives me a dirty look or says like we're from whatever being picked on as a kid bully, they can a shit. Like I always play that out. Like how am I going? Am I going to have to fight this guy? Am I going to have to fucking defend? How's it gonna play out? Oh, he's, he's got a long fucking neck. I'm going to take us back and choke him out. Whatever. You know what I'm saying? But, but it just showed me how silly this dumb ass mind game that I would play and I would go down the rabbit hole on a fucking daily basis sometimes.

Speaker 3:          09:10          Like, like just playing into this thought of negativity that had no space for me. And it doesn't mean no good to play that out. Like, well that's fine cause then I'll do this. No, no, no, no, none of that shit. I'm wasting time and becoming emotionally attached to those thoughts. It's not just, Oh, I'm thinking about this. I'm feeling like I'm going to fight right now. That fucks you up. That turns you into not your best version of yourself. So that vision from mushrooms was just a fucking game changer. It doesn't stop me from having those thoughts, but it allows me to catch myself. I'm aware of it.

Speaker 4:          09:52          Okay.
