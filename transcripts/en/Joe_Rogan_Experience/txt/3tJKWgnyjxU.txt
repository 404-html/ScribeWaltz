Speaker 1:          00:01          Hello Freak bitches while there's this thing, uh, speaking of guys who are in the business of doing heroic acts, there's a, you've heard of the firemen fantasy. I mean the fact that women find guys bought fireman to be very attractive. And it actually turns out that there was a study that was done that actually shows this to be the case. And I discussed this in one of my articles on psychology today. Uh, if you have a guy approach women either wearing a fireman suit or not, uh, his chances of getting her phone number increases quite substantially. Really if he is wearing a fireman. So how do they know this? Did they do a study where they did they have the same guy? Not where the firemen with the same approach and the same, same word, same script, same everything. One version. It's called the field experiment.

Speaker 1:          00:48          In one version. You, you approach women at a cafe wearing the stuff and another version, he's the guy who actually did that research is a French psychologist. His name is Nico [inaudible] and I've actually covered a few of his studies on my website. Uh, my most read article ever over maybe three, 400,000 readers is one of his studies where I was simply, because we're going to talk about the blowback issue now and here again, it was a study where he looked at the likelihood of women being picked up as hitchhikers as a function of their breasts size. So he actually had the same woman and they, you know, artificially manipulated her breast size and on different days she would stand there. And, and of course it turned out that men were much more likely to pick up the woman if she had the same woman that she had bigger rest side.

Speaker 1:          01:41          So I just summarize that study, put it up, and then I remember I'd gone on vacation, came back from vacation, found out that I had completely gone viral, but I had a million hate mail, not just from readers but from fellow psychology today, bloggers who were arguing that I was, you know, peddling pornography because I had a picture as the teaser image for that article. I had a photo of a woman sitting in a passenger seat would big with large breasts. Well, it seemed appropriate for the topic given that that's what the topic of the study was. But by putting that image, I was objectifying women. I was treating them as mere sex objects. And so even though I had nothing to do with the study and I was simply summarizing somebody else's work, I was a horrifying pornographic peddler. Isn't it funny that just a photograph of a woman with large breasts is considered pornographic?

Speaker 1:          02:33          Now, listen to this. So then I've also written articles on psychology today where I talk about all kinds of issues dealing with penis size. You know, so do women want a guy with a bigger penis? Are they more likely to have orgasms? She's got a bigger penis. Uh, if you're in a gay relationship, man, man, uh, are you likely to be top or bottom as a function of your penis size? That study has been done by science. And so for those articles, I put sexy images of men. So then I wrote to each of those people who had written the hate man. I said, well, in all fairness, you now have to write an equally hateful thing. Because I am also sexually exploiting men's bodies. Of course they went away and never came back. We have the, I think this is one of the coolest times ever to be alive.

Speaker 1:          03:21          I really do and I think that one of the reasons why it's one of the coolest times ever to be alive is because it's just so chaotic and it's so strange and no one can do anything about it. No one can stop it. Now they're going to try and net neutrality and they're gonna try to put the brakes here and charge people for that and you're gonna, you're in trouble and you're on a list and I'm going to watch you. What do you try to be anonymous? You fucker. I want to know where you are.

Speaker 2:          03:47          We were, we were talking about this right before the show, like all that shit that's coming out, like all the corruption and anger and government and competence. I'm starting to believe that it has to be there because that's what wakes us up to. We don't need so many agencies. We don't need like so many wars and so much bullshit. Let's just decide things for ourselves. And of course we need some laws. We need some police, we need some roads. And that's really it. Thank you very much. You know, like have a nice day. We don't need you archiving fucking baby photos. Yeah. That's what we've gone over the line. And so you're seeing the people realize that people realize that banks are ineffective ingredients. People realize that the old media is dying out and they don't give a shit about their viewers. So they're just moving over to better stuff. And it's happening across the board in pretty much every industry even. Um, I had, uh, this woman, Tiffany van goalie on my show recently. He was another podcast host and she was talking to me about how all these grocery stores now have an organic section and that's taking off. And so you're seeing like this, we have new standards. Like that's, I think what's happening is that we have higher standards than we used to. And so across the board is better stuff.

Speaker 1:          04:53          Yeah. There's no doubt that things are getting more complex and harder to control because no doubt, and there's no doubt that these old systems, whether it's like afternoon, when you watch the news, it's six or five or whatever the fuck it is. It seems like you're watching a parody, right? The anchorman is becoming more and more, I mean, when you, when you watch, if you try to watch like the La news tried to watch any of those channels, local news at five o'clock it's like these people were aliens, right?

Speaker 2:          05:20          I think these things, we're not supposed to exist forever and that's why to us it seems so kind of silly. It's like it's supposed to be dying out. That's like the, it's the new season. New stuff's going to come out. It's kind of like fashion, right? Like every year it's going to be something different. That's the way it works. Now. It's a corporate media and centralization, top down type stuff is dying out and I'm sure it'll continue to exist in a bunch of different forms, but that idea is getting weaker and weaker.

Speaker 3:          05:49          [inaudible] okay.
