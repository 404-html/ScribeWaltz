Like the girls aren't even around, like I have no sexual esteem is no even reason for my Dick. The yard. Right. But it's like in my mind I'm like overthinking it, which makes it worse. Right. So like fuck it. So I take the other half, so now I'm like 200 milligrams into this fucking bag or which is like, you know, double the absolute Max from what you know.

Speaker 1:          05:18          Some guys have to get their Dick drained, right? Yeah, yeah. Well, we'll get to that, so go back to my hotel and I'm like, fucking banging this shit out of this girl. Like, you know, I mean I got like veins coming out of my head. I'm sweating profusely and I'm like doing blue. I'd fucked her for like maybe like 45, 50 minute. Like it wasn't not pleasurable at all. This was like work, right? I'm just like. And after like, fuck man, I think it was like 50 minutes. I just like, I had to quit. Like I was just like, I just, you know, I just knew there was zero chance of me coming and I was like, punished this chicken up and I'm just like. And I like didn't like I was tired of when the bathroom took a cold shower, my dick, like go down.

Speaker 1:          05:58          Like I and I ordered some room service, ended up like tucking it up into my waist. And um, because like there's just no going down with this bucket thing. Right? So ether room service I think. Oh yeah. Then I actually ended up taking a value in, went to sleep, Bangor again, woke up, went and ate some Mexican food. I was like betting on the sports game and I started getting like this pain in my shoulder and I didn't really know what it was, is like kind of just felt like a, like an ache. So started doing pushups that didn't really make it feel any better. And I was like stretching my arm. I was like trying to sleep, but I couldn't even lay on that side. I'm just like, what the fuck? Like heart attack never even entered into the realm of possibility of shit that could be wrong.

Speaker 1:          06:41          Me, right. Like fucking 25 I guess like shoulder pain. Like wow, you know, I, I had no idea about having a hard day. So call my mom tardy at the family doctor on the phone. She calls this dude up and I'm like getting like kind of shorter breaths. I'm like fuck. So I just hang up the phone and I find out the hospitals like 10 minutes away. So I'm like, fuck it. I'll just get a cap, be faster. I should have got an ambulance, but I got a cab, you know, note to self, always get an ambulance if you got any shit because I got the cab. I was in the waiting room for like 50 minutes. I pulled out like 10 grand on my pocket. I told the Lady, I was like, I'll give you 10 grand. Let me talk to the fucking doctor.

Speaker 1:          07:18          Like something's wrong. I don't know what's wrong, but I know something's wrong. Anyway, she take the 10 grand, fuck no, let me sit in the fucking waiting room and like 30, 40 minutes go by. Finally could see my doctor. He's like, Holy Shit, like you're having a full blown heart attack all this stuff and giving the Nitroglycerin and I call my dad and my mom was like, you know, telling my mom, I'm like, I'm thinking I'm fucking done. Right. And because this has been going on for awhile and I'm like having a hard time breathe in. I'm like in pain. And so they gave me the nitroglycerin right? And I start feeling better. They do an angiogram or whatever where they check out the heart. That said there was no damage. Parents come out the next day, I have another one and I'm like. And I tell the doctor I'm going say.

Speaker 1:          08:00          And then my doctor was Conrad Murray too, by the way, which was Michael Jackson, Dr Guy that smoked him and the craziest. I your talk it. And the spookiest thing about the whole deal was my grandfather had the same doctor in the same motherfucking hospital exactly one year prior and died. So I'm just like, you know, this is not looking good for the home team. This was before he killed Michael Jackson is asked to write sound like, you know, fuck, I'm just in the hospital. So I call my dad. I'm like, I'm having another heart. I tell the nurse and they're like, no, like your thing looks fine. I call my dad. I'm like, there's something wrong with dad, like comes down to the hospital and sure enough, like I'm having a second, like minor heart attack. I'm like, what the fuck? So they do a bunch of tests and say my heart's fine and then they ask you for like the list.

Speaker 1:          08:44          So I got to like give them the list of my ex girlfriends there. My Mom's there, my dad's there, and I'm just like, started off with like, oh well, you know, the smoking the pot. And he's like, well, you know, like, you better tell us like, what you've been like, it's important. We need to figure out what's going on with you. And I'll say, ah, and you know, I did, you know, I did some, you know, ecstasy, cocaine and like, my dad like looks over at me like, what the fuck, you know, my dad like Super Square and um, anyway, so then I was like, yeah, I think it took some Viagara. My girlfriend's like fucking rioting now. And he's like, how much? I'm like, 200 milligrams just like, what is twitter? I'm like, I don't fucking know. It's a good thing, you know, seemed like water, you know, like that's like an insane amount.

Speaker 1:          09:26          Like. Anyway. So I, uh, I, I ended up staying in the hospital for like four days. I actually fucked my girlfriend in the hospital with all these cords and crazy shit. Jesus smoked a joint in the hospital thing. I fucked her, like I had a buddy of mine bringing like wine coolers in Chinese food, I think the worst patient of all time. Right. And somehow like, you know, I'm so give me all these fucking pills. I got to take their telling me like I got to take these pills for the rest of my life for the rest of your life. That's what they said. And I was just like, after like three days, like I fucked my girlfriend eight, the Chinese food. I was like, okay. I'm like back to being invincible again through all the shit is a heart attack. Exactly. I've heard that, that phrase.

Speaker 1:          10:07          But what is the exact medical thing that's going on? You know, for guidance had to. I should know. Um, I don't know, I think it's just like basically when your heart's not getting enough oxygen or something or um, I don't know, it's just not functioning properly. Usually there's like a. yeah, there's like a blocked artery. There's something and I think like coke is a, is a vasoconstrictor, whatever, so maybe like constricted my veins. So there wasn't like an Agra visal dilator, so does shouldn't have bounce it out, I think, but I don't know. You know what I mean? I don't know. I don't really know the science behind it, but I know that like coke and wag or I don't think you're supposed to make some. I Dunno it. Wow. I mean, I know I did a lot of both. Should've canceled out, but I guess it didn't. I guess what the body was like so confused it going. So a director is like, fuck, you had to shut down. I don't know. Wow. Wow. That's fucking terrifying.
