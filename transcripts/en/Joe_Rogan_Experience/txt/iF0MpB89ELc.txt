Speaker 1:          00:00:00       Uh, hey fucking freaks. What's happening? I should probably tweet. I fucked up. I forgot to tweet this so I'll tweet while I'm doing it. I like how you did that. I like how your man, we got to get better shit at my podcast. What do you mean what you guys get the screens? Anything that you're talking about? Jamie's really quick, man. He's on it. Like anything that you're talking about. He's already got some visuals and some cutaways. That's huge. See that quick? God Damn, that's an ambulance and serious production value right there to have. If you want to talk some shit, I don't have that. That's what socks. I do not. I we can hook you up. Yeah, yeah. You know what? I need to step it up. We'll make it, we'll talk after the show. I need to stop. Good cameras and shit. You went from the you, you guys like right now we're at the web cam cameras.

Speaker 1:          00:00:50       You know there are 90 90 bucks each I cam or something like that. That's what all the low budget podcasts. When I look at it, you got now shit, they're just cameras man. But those are like 400 $500 each. They'd probably something like that. Yeah. Look at you. They're not cheap. Yeah, the setup. It looks cool. And now wait a minute, are you, this is what my suggestion are we on? Yeah. Oh my [inaudible]. I think it'd be cool. You got, you should start. I'm not just getting one shot of Joe. Have like four camera shot. This is not something that talking about this. Would it be cool? I need more in my face, bro. [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          00:01:32       angle me people tired of looking at that angle. We're gonna mix it up. I want to make a bloody all right. I did a podcast recently and I had a makeup, I'm not joking, there's their cameras. They had a makeup person. I said, I don't even wear makeup for work for TV. I don't work makeup. You can't put makeup on me. Like we're just gonna put some anti shine. I'm like, get the fuck out here. Are you crazy for a podcast? If you're out of your mind. But that meant, you know, that's production value. It's what they do while they're doing a television show. It's not a fucking plate of carrots and celery shit. Add that. Then I slowly is tapping into that television, the television status. Well I think that's what they're trying to do. This podcast or granola bars at the cheap ones, man, nature's made Granola, apple and oats.

Squarespace is one of my favorite experiences on, on the web as far as like, if you want to create something and use a website, then make something easier.

Speaker 2:          00:04:49       There's a lot of different websites to give you a nice, nice, uh, self help services. And there's, there's all sorts of different websites that can help you with all sorts of things. But for the longest time, making a website was fucking hard at shit. I used to have. My friend Andrew made a lot of my websites. He's just a really clever guy who knew a lot about html and knew how to code flash and he's make a bad ass website. But I could never do what he did on it on my own. But now you can, you literally can anyone, you could go on Squarespace and make the dopest website. Actually Eddie, you should probably do something like this because you would be really good at that. You'd be really good at designing your creative guy. You'd be really good at designing your own shit. And Squarespace makes it super easy.

Speaker 2:          00:05:31       It's just drag and drop. You can make websites that seem like massively professional and you can do it all yourself. We had a Squarespace contest where we let listeners, um, create their own websites and it was really not even fair because we only, we only had to pick like quick four or something like that. It was ridiculous. There was so many good ones. It's incredible what you can do now. So you can make a website easy and it's so easy, easy. And on top of that you can make a easy, you can set up an online store like got Brian has done them while the show has been going on. He set up a website and a store in the time that it takes to do the commercial, like he'll just start selling goofy shit like fake goofy shit. That's when he sets it up.

Speaker 2:          00:06:12       It's insane. It's insane. It's literally insane. Huh? It's better than anything I've ever seen before. It was car. As far as like constructing a website. Well the guys who do it, they're cool as fuck too. I met them in New York. So you don't need like a to, it doesn't need to be super complex know you don't have to do, you don't have to like go to a website company. I mean I have a website company that designed mine and they're great and I love them and they make my tee shirts and shit to uprise and creative. They're really cool guys and girls, gals, women. They're very cool people. So I like, I like giving them money. They're bad ass. You know, I'm, I'm happy. But if I was going to start my own website right now, if I didn't have a website, absolutely I would use Squarespace a hundred percent.

Speaker 2:          00:06:50       Does it have a forum to, that's a good question. Date of 24, seven support. Um, they uh, live chat and email. Um, and uh, they also have a logo creator, which is pretty dope. You can create a clean, simple logo in minutes. Um, it's uh, which is really interesting. You know, you're talking about starting up a company like on it and then we have a logo. Caveman coffee has a logo, you know, logos, if you can, if you could put together a logo, it's like, you know, your shit looks more professional than just text. That's the secret land is, is to get that logo ingrained in everyone's brain once they trying to you. That's why he can't change up your logo. You got to pick a lug who stick with it because if you keep changing it, that fucks up the, that brainwash process. Didn't Hicks and Gracie catch some heat from Nike that Nike wanted that Swish out of his, uh, his awesome triangle here.

Speaker 2:          00:07:43       And something about that. I wish I'd asked him. I saw him this weekend. That dude's still looks great. He's in his 50s, like healthiest. Fuck. It looks great. Excellent motherfucking Gracie. Anyway, go to squarespace.com enter the code Joe and get uh, for the free trial and 10% off your first purchase.

Speaker 2:          00:08:33       How about just make cool shit here? That's probably better. Right? All right. That's how those Alpha brains are starting to take over. So that was like 30 seconds of reorganizing my neurons. Does that make sense? Can you say that? I don't know if that's an actual event. Uh, we're also brought to you by on it, not com. O. N. N. I. T we got a lot of big things that I'm talking to as you bra about uh, on it, uh, that I'll be discussing in the future. We've got some, we got some big moves. Well we're trying to do with [inaudible] is we're trying to put together a company that what we call, um, the design is a human optimization website and what we mean by that is we want to provide you access to everything that we find. It's beneficial whether it's anything that's beneficial for cognitive thinking, like Alpha brain.

Speaker 2:          00:09:22       If it's for your mood, which like new mood, which is a five HTP and l trip defense supplement that actually helps your brain produce more serotonin. Whether it's things like kettle bells or battle ropes or hemp powder, hemp protein powder, the best ham pro protein powder we can find in hemp force. We just try to find the very best shit available. That's our motto. Motto is, what would we want to buy when it comes to human optimization? What kind of shit would we want to buy? And so we even hired artists to make dope exercise equipment like these primal bells. This uh, cool. Um, this guy, Steven's Shubin Jr is a really cool artist and his, his, a work that he did on, um, the Zombie bells and the, uh, the primate bells would pull those images up. Jamie, the primal bells are all the great apes and the Zombie bells are all like, you know, if you want to freak yourself out that you were getting in shape for the apocalypse, what better way to do it then the sling around at giant Iron Zombie head or at shine fucking gorilla head.

Speaker 2:          00:10:23       They're awesome. I love these things. They make working out fun and I know people that have in their house, they don't even use them as a exercise equipment. They just think they're cool. They leave them as door stoppers and shit. Anyway, go to [inaudible] Dot Com o. N n I t use the Codeword Rogan and save 10% off any and all supplements. This Thursday night I am in Miami Bitch. I'm going to be at the Fillmore, uh, the Jackie Gleason theater at the film war and I'm with the Great Tony Hinchcliffe.

Speaker 2:          00:11:30       the Joe Rogan experience,

Speaker 3:          00:11:32       try by day Joe Rogan podcast all day. Ah,

Speaker 2:          00:11:40       right where to even begin with this one. Um, you think it'd be cool to watch the fight and instead of thinking of all the, talking about different pieces of it, cause it, there's so many different aspects to it. We could you think it'd be cool for

Speaker 1:          00:11:54       the viewer of who watch it and I just tell you what I'm saying to him. Sure. But are we allowed to do that? Like Metamora so they paying people to, uh, do you have to pay to watch her? How it is? It's on youtube. Should we probably should ask though before we do something? I love it, dude. Are you kidding me? You're kidding me. That's what's asked him on, uh, I hope I can actually call them. I think it'd be cool to signal on this place just kind of sketch, um, for the, just to give people background and what are we talking about here? Okay. Eddie Bravo. Uh, one of my favorite human beings ever walked the earth. My brother who, uh, I've known, uh, we became best friends. Like almost instantly. We started hanging out together in the late nineties, late nineties, like thousand somewhere else. I knew you from John Jocks in like 97 you were the guy who was on an actor who's on a TV show.

Speaker 1:          00:12:48       You were doing news radio, but I'd never seen news radio, but oh, that's that one actor dude. And you were taking privates and you didn't do that many group classes. At first you thought you were doing the dope shit for the group. Classes are for the peasants. Privates are, that's when you get the real shit. That's what you were thinking. Well, I thought it was going to learn quicker. I wanted to talk bad about that dude. You know, he was a real good guy that was teaching me. I really like him, but it wasn't, it doesn't, you have to roll with a bunch of other people. It's just the fact, you know, whenever I hear someone telling me I'm taking private lessons, I'm going to do some Jujitsu, take private lessons. Like, well, you can definitely learn more than the average person, but if you want to really learn Jujitsu, you got to get dirty. You got to get in there. And uh, I didn't figure that out. I didn't figure it out until I started rolling with you. So I started hanging out with you. It's called Haluk right now. But uh, the guy was a good guy. He just a,

Speaker 1:          00:13:48       we've got a story for you ladies and gentlemen, this if there's a backstory of this, but I think he's mad at me, man. I haven't heard from him. I doubt it. Yeah, he's mad at me. Don't say that. He put it out there. He Jenksen I dunno. I'm saying

Speaker 4:          00:14:00       hello.

Speaker 1:          00:14:01       Halogens. Joe Rogan. Hey, before you say anything, we're on the air right now. We're live. I just, I wanted to, uh, I wanted to know what your feelings were out of respect when it comes to a youtube, the videos being up on youtube. Are you trying to pull those down because we were going to, we're going to play one and talk about it, but only with your permission because I, I didn't know if you, uh, if you were pulling those down off the Internet.

Speaker 4:          00:14:40       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:14:45       All right. Remember, we're on live, so don't give out any information right now. Don't get crazy. So we can play it though. On the podcast and we can, we can talk about it over it.

Speaker 4:          00:14:57       Beautiful. Long process.

Speaker 1:          00:15:13       Yeah. Well that's, that's a great attitude too. I mean, let them know like people, this is a really awesome event you put on and people should support an event like that just with their own ethics, regardless of whether it's available for free. That's my feeling is metamorris is an awesome thing for Jujitsu and we should all support it.

Speaker 4:          00:15:35       Beautiful.

Speaker 1:          00:15:39       That's a beautiful attitude. I agree 1000% that does not even a real number. Right? You can only get to a hundred hey listen man, I just want to tell you whatever you need, man. If you want to have me promote the next ones, I'm totally down. That was an awesome event. You had some really high class matchups with really great Jujitsu talent. It was a pleasure to watch, man. I really, really enjoyed it. So I just, I'm going to support you in any way with this cause I just think it's an awesome thing you're doing.

Speaker 4:          00:16:08       Let's do it.

Speaker 1:          00:16:13       Let's do it, brother. Let's do it. Let's do it. All right. I'm alive. I'm going to go, so we'll talk to you soon. All right, take care my friend. Hey Man. Hey Dude. I Dunno, I haven't heard from him so I thought he's probably busy and you know, it was his uncle's probably upset at you. What happened? This is what's going on this for people don't know. Eddie Bravo is a famous for um, one very particular upset a long time ago when in 2003, we went down to Brazil and Eddie was competing in the Abu Dhabi, uh, world submission championships, which is the biggest event in a Nogi grappling. It's a huge, huge event. And this is the event that gave birth to legends like Marcella Garcia. You know, where people got to see him perform for the first time. And I mean, it's so many, so much high level matchups recently chrome crazy who he had in the podcast head is a huge victory in Abu Dhabi.

Speaker 1:          00:17:10       Eddie went down there and Hoya Gracie's maybe one of the most decorated Gracie's ever when it comes to competition, I think probably the most right up next to Hodgett, right? Yeah. At the top two. I mean, the boiler is, he's a legend of a true multiple g championships, world championships in multiple Abu Dhabi Nogi Championships. He won it three times in a row and no one's ever scored a point on him. The guys about as good as you can get for that 45 deficient. His Dad is Helio Gracie. His Dad was literally the founder of presenting digit two along with Carlos Gracie. I mean, what his dad did was nothing short of like for when you put into perspective the

Speaker 5:          00:17:49       like the history of martial arts and different people. Like Bruce Lee obviously plays a huge part in many making my martial arts exciting, uh, getting people into martial arts. Chuck Norris also huge part. John Claude van Damme, a very big pie that gets people into the schools in the first place. But when you talk about a person who's like maybe the single most important person in all of martial arts, it might be Helio Gracie. I mean it might, he might be the most important person ever. A small man who uses leverage and beautiful technique to submit. People took on all commerce. We 140 pounds and he's fighting these giant dudes. I mean it's an amazing family. The whole family is just what a crazy movie type family. I mean you think about it like a family that wouldn't even exist in the real world. How about a family where one bad motherfucker, this one jujitsu genius.

Speaker 5:          00:18:43       Elio. Gracie has a bunch of sons and they all turn out to be bad motherfuckers. I mean whatever. What, what other guy has had like produced 20 killers, 30 killers and his own brood? Well if you get into the story with Carlos Gracie, his older brother, he's the one who actually learn Jujitsu and showed it to, to Helia and they both thought and stuff. But towards the end as they got older, Carlos fought less and managed Heleo most cause Heleo became the beast and Haley was the one who refined and and tweak the system and made it what it is today technically. But without Carlos learning it, Heleo would have never learned Jujitsu. So it was really, they were both very Heleo designed it and polished it and tweaked it. But Carlos is the one that showed him the Ra techniques from uh, what he learned from my Ada.

Speaker 5:          00:19:38       I think his name is. Yes. Yes. I mean, and I don't even when we're saying this, this is no disrespect, that's a movie. How come they haven't made a fucking been out blockbuster James Cameron movie about the Gracies come on. Who would play Hixon but you know what? Jujitsu guys would be so disappointed because in an hour and a half they'd have to just gloss over shit and like the real story is way more complicated. Yeah. Yeah it would, it would, can you imagine an hour and a half? You explained the whole Gracie story with all the brothers and Carlson and Helson and all their different stories and health and high end and that's dude, they would have to have like the high end edge would be like 10 minutes of the movie. That's it. They'd have to high end wood. You know there are folks who don't know. High end was like the crazy grace called him Gracie devil.

Speaker 5:          00:20:22       He was like one of the wildest cause he fought in pride as well. A lot of them fought in pride of course hens. Oh, Henzel fought in pride and there's so many great people, great martial artists that came out of that family, um, high and Hanzo and how for all brothers. And they were like, they were like the Tasmanian devils. But Hensdale was probably the most, a friendly, I think, high end and how for just ready to throw down at any time with anybody. They were the two pit bulls. How hands on was a pit bull to and according to the Machados and their stories, Hanzo was always the one laughing and joking and everyone loved him, but he was always in the middle of a fight. Someone would want to fight them and they'd be a riot. And you know, hands on has, Hanzo is like a super happy go lucky guy.

Speaker 5:          00:21:10       But he has a, he has a side to him that he could be, he could turn it on. And you remember when he live tweeted, beaten up those muggers, hence this up. What a bad motherfucker. Henzel Gracie has any thanked the uh, the mayor for a not allowing guns. So don't worry about my gone. And he went out and these guys, apparently they were following him and they were thinking about mugging him. And not only did he beat these guys up like he, he was live tweeting it and chasing after them. I and m for some reason he knew he was being targeted and that like they were targeting Henzel Gracie, what a human would have to be in the movie somehow they would have to squeeze that. That would be like a loss scenes. You know what I mean? That didn't quite make the story and they couldn't make it fit.

Speaker 5:          00:21:58       But that's a crazy, that's a modern day Gracie story. Cause you hear about all these old Gracie Dojo storm stories and there's all these legendary, legendary stories. But he tweeted pictures of his hands. This is modern day old school Gracie stories. Right. And it's only a couple of, what is it? A year ago, what year was it? What year was it? What did it say up there? And the crazy thing is I was on Twitter when it was happening. I was watching it live as it was happening. I was actually on Twitter while he was, he was tweeting and these guys are following me, check this out, and he was taking pictures. I'm going to lure them and see like some alley or to your corner fucking show. These poor guys, he's just took pictures of his hands. I'll bust it up and bloody, he's probably has so, so many connections and Nyp d.

Speaker 5:          00:22:45       You know what I mean? He knew that if he needed a beat up some muggers that no one would ever go to him. And he's stressed. He's so connected. Well he's also talking about it. We'd like such glee, you know, reminded him of a, you know, growing up in Rio. He really is like, I mean he's in New York City, you know, he's about as connected as you can mother fucking get. Come on. There's a lot of cops are trained Jujitsu. We know connected to every, every side, you know, they know some serious mobsters and share it. I would imagine. Probably knows at least for sure. Mobsters want to hang out with Hanzo. You know what I mean? Gangsters would love to hang out with Enzo. That's a real life killer. I there, he's aggressive guy to his personality is so fucking great. Like when you're around him, he's always hugging people and super friendly.

Speaker 5:          00:23:36       Like she's got a great energy to them and he's a bad motherfucker. My favorite Gracie of all time and, and I, I love, there's a lot of Gracie's man that I personally, that I know person and there's a lot that I don't even know. I'm like, I'm never met. Like I've never sat down and talked to Horry on. Um, I'm never sat down, talked to hodge her, you know what I mean? There's a lot of great Helson. I never sat down and talked to house and, but the, the Gracies that I did have, did have dual, do, have relationships with and did have time to talk and get to know is my favorite all time is rose Gracie. She, I love her to death. That is one of the sweetest, coolest chicks on the planet. And she's real, you know, you're either come from the Heleo side of the Carlos side.

Speaker 5:          00:24:20       She's the only one, her and her sister. The come from both because hoary on her dad married his cousin, Helio Gracie is our grandfather. Carlos Gracie is a great grandfather. Weird, right? So rose Gracie is the most Gracie, she's grace. He's doubled. She's double Gracie. Her blood is, it's like Damn Pyre, Gracie blood. You know what I mean? There's her and her sister. So Gracie, double Gracie and she's the coolest one to me. To me, out of all the ones I've met, I love her. We worked together and with the, she runs the Gracie nationals and the Gracie world and we work together and, and uh, man, she's, she's, she's awesome. I can't awesome. I love Henner. I know. Henner I know here. They've always been cool to me. I want to get those guys in the podcast too. Obviously. You just heard that I would do Haluk I would love to do him on as well.

Speaker 5:          00:25:14       Henner in here on, I've done a fucking amazing job of promoting Jujitsu and in a technical sense by showing those Gracie breakdowns. Those are great. Those are really fucking, they're entertaining. Henry's like really captivating. He's got like a great energy to him when he's a natural, you know, natural speaker and natural instructor from all those years of teaching Jujitsu classes. But he's very, he's very entertaining, like his cadence, everything but very technical and they're Jujitsu delivery. Their passion comes through. It's very obvious. They really like what they do. And I find that infectious, you know, those guys are awesome here on is always been cool to me and her always been cool. And uh, a crone. Gracie, I just got to very cool. Now I've met him and we've talked, he's so cool. He went to my after party. That's how cool. He went to my after party.

Speaker 5:          00:26:01       That's awesome. Yeah, that's, that's pretty crazy. Right? And I told him, I go, aren't you going to get killed for this? You do here. This is like a pure 10th planet after party. Everybody here is 10th plan and he's just so cool. That's so damn cool man. I love that guy. Well they, you know, there's always these inter family feuds. Yeah. There's a lot of weird shit that goes on. Um, point being, here's the story. Eddie goes down there under dog. Gracie is a legend. We're talking about a legend from the most legendary family. That's one thing you say unequivocably. What is the most legendary family of martial arts? The Gracies for sure. 100% there's not even a close second. Probably the most legendary family that's ever existed like what other family has known for something like that. Again, like a big huge fan of world champions known to be experts at strangling human beings.

Speaker 5:          00:26:57       Not just experts, but think of the amount of champions, hoists Gracie, the very first UFC champion who arguably change the world's opinion. Instantaneousness of martial arts. That one guy, super legend, hoists Gracie. Then you've got Henzel Gracie, another champion. You've got Heuler Gracie the most decorated. Him and Haji are the most decorated. Hickson who beats all of them? Yeah. Hixon who's the best or you ask any of them. They say Hickson's the best. How crazy is that? That's insane. That's what Matt [inaudible] Hixson Lips, Hicks, Euler. He webs everybody, you know, but all, even though they get whipped by Hixon, they're still legends. They're still better than most of the people walk. And so it's so crazy. The different levels that is the most legendary for real family of all time. Yeah. I really think about that. They're, the family business is breaking bones and putting people to their death with our bare hands.

Speaker 5:          00:27:58       That's the family business. It's pretty crazy. Who's, who's more hardcore than the Gracies. There's uh, there's uh, some video. Uh, it was like a demonstration that Hixon did. We're Hickson and Heuler had like a little sparring demonstration, you know, I don't know what it was though. I Dunno. It was orchestrated. It was like at one of those, um, Japanese events. It'd be pride. Yeah. They were just messing around. Yeah. They just sort of demonstrated some techniques, you know, but the only video that I've seen of them rolling, it's like there's some Gnocchi video of them rolling, you know, but the, the, all, any video that involves Hickson and his brothers ultimately leads to the brother tapping, which is insane. Everyone gets smashed by Hicks. That's insane. When you think about that, this one guy and a family, a fucking super champions, as one guy rises to the top over all of them universally acknowledged.

Speaker 5:          00:28:49       And even the Brazilians that did you get to that, there's a lot of rivalries between the Gracies and then it gets really technical and there's certain Gracie's don't like other Gracie's and theirs and that's normal. And all families, it's just normal. So the fact that it's a Jujitsu family, that doesn't mean they're immune to what all families go through. All families have division. This aunt is not talking to that and my mom is not talking to her sister. They hate each other. Three are like, like everyone says, it's, that's just the way families are, so they're not admitting to it. So it's totally normal. But uh, when you get into what's really going on, man, uh, it's just, it's insane is what it is. It's like the, this one family that has created such an empire of martial arts and in my opinion, changed martial arts forever. I think hoists Gracie and victory in the

Speaker 2:          00:29:42       ultimate fighting championship was one of the most important moments in the history of martial arts. Without a doubt, if not the most important because people got to see what really works. People got to see something in a way that you never saw before. He never saw a small man who didn't look physically imposing, dismantle other people with techniques.

Speaker 6:          00:30:01       Yeah, and the whole, even the hoary on was the guy that actually made it happen physically. The whole family was involved because Horry on is the one who, it was his idea. We need to put this show on in the states and prove the, that Jujitsu is the most effective martial art puppet by. We could do this, but it was because of what he saw Hixon doing because of what he saw heuler doing in the, in the Dojo storm matches and Gracie in action tapes. It was because what his father Heleo spread to everyone. That's what made horian wouldn't have the drive and the vision if he didn't see what Hickson was doing on a daily basis. And when his dad did and know the history of what his dad did, all that everybody, Carlson, Gracie, he was using all the cars and Gracie fighters and the Gracie and action tapes. It was all that, all the Gracie, uh, events and all the Gracie people that were all involved and hoary on needed all that to explode the UFC. So it wasn't just horror on it was everybody Horian couldn't have done it alone. So, uh, that's why there was some, there was some division, some guys wanted to go here and say, you know, I'm going to do this on this side and then you know, the people. But that's, that's totally normal. But, um,

Speaker 2:          00:31:19       also there was some things opening up in other countries too, like kicks in and started doing Japan. Valley two was around the same time. It wasn't only one 94 and it just exploded.

Speaker 6:          00:31:26       Yeah. When, when Hawaii blew it all up, all the people that were involved down the chain, Carlson and all those guys. And everyone, they said, okay, this is, we're all part of this. So that then it just grew and exploded in the Gracie. It just instantly Jujitsu just spread all over the world. Instantly. Everybody needed Hugh Jitsu, martial arts masters were traveling, all of their all going into Jujitsu. All these American guys going into Rio, you know, just became like, uh, uh, uh, the thing to do, man in martial arts is go to Brazil and then we, we got exposed to chew Scotty as and [inaudible] and all that shit's here because,

Speaker 2:          00:32:04       yep. And that's one of the things about, um, about martial arts at a lot of people don't realize is that for maybe thousands of years, it pretty much remained the same when the Gracies came along. That was what really kickstarted it to this level. Right now, you know, you can say that Jujitsu is not their most important martial art, but historically it's the most important martial art. Unquestionably. Like that one event. People where people got to see a guy like hoists dominate these bigger, stronger guys and he wasn't a scary looking physical. It didn't like, it wasn't built like Mike Tyson or anything like that and it wasn't built like Roy Jones. When you look at them and go, Whoa, how can that guy move? That guy moves like a coast. It wasn't that, it was just technique, you know? So, uh, pretty, pretty amazing thing to watch. It's one of the things people don't realize too about Chuck Norris.

Speaker 2:          00:32:52       Chuck Norris was ahead of the fucking curve, man. Chuck Norris, even though like a lot of people associated with like Walker, Texas ranger and you know, like movies and TV shows. Now Chuck Norris was a legit kickboxer like legit champion kickboxer legit karate champion. He was a bad mother fucker. And he really was into martial arts, into training in martial arts and learning new things. And when did he start training with the Machados way before the UFC? Way before the UFC, right? Like, didn't you have like an eighties? He had like a purple belt or a brown belt before the UFC for the first year. I've said

Speaker 6:          00:33:28       he was responsible somehow for, uh, the UFC getting moved along and there were, there was some kind of connections, you know, cause once it, Chuck Norris discovered Jujitsu, he was all over and he just immediately injected it into his Chuck Norris System. Anybody that's in the Chuck Norris Affiliation System, they have to do Jujitsu. That's a karate association that requires you to do Brazilian Jujitsu. Chuck Norris is the map.

Speaker 2:          00:33:56       Yeah. He, um, I met him twice. I met him once when I was at you with you. We met him at some kickboxing event. Remember when went to see that world combat league. Thanks Brad. Thought an hour. Yeah, dude, there was, that was a lot. Raymond Daniels too, I think was on that card. Um, a lot of great fighters. I was fun as hell and, but just meeting Chuck Norris was like holy, but I didn't get a picture. This met him again recently. I got a picture of them. That guy, the, he's a real deal, man. You know what he did? And he's such a humble guy too. Like all these guys I was on this, uh, diocese does deus too. Um, it's got Jim Harrison, it's famous karate champion as well. They were a congratulating him and Chuck Norris was like, he, all of his stories like involve like bad things happening to him.

Speaker 2:          00:34:43       All of his stories involved. Like, uh, he, uh, he, he panicked. He couldn't talk in front of people. So he told this hilarious story about, I'm not even remembering set, talking, not even remembering, giving a speech because he was so terrified to speak in front of people. Like very self deprecating, you know, it was where a lot of fellows, you know, you're getting to that sort of an event and the guy looks for it as an opportunity to go in the glory days and talk about his past victories and that kind of shit. Chuck Norris said none of that. He was laughing and smiling, you know, just self deprecating. That guy's a legit martial artists. Like a real legit martial artist.

Speaker 6:          00:35:19       Yeah. And, and of course, you know, with that kind of mentality, as soon as you discovered that there's a big weakness in your game, you want to fill that shit and, and fill it immediate immediately. So he got it. He was integrated you jet to then he started training with the Machados and got really tight with them and ended up getting his black belt from Carlos I think. And that's why Carlos went to Texas and yeah. And that's who I got my black belt from. John Jacques Machado, one of the Great Machado brothers. There's five of them, Hagan, Johnny [inaudible] and John Jock and Carlos.

Speaker 2:          00:35:54       And uh, John Jog is another, I mean the Machado family is another legendary family as well. I mean, you think he again hodge or John Jock, I mean that, that family as well became legendary for very, very high level black belts. The we're cousins. Yeah. I mean, and there's a photo of them. Look in John. Jack has just a beautiful human being. I love that car. No Spartan, he's just got such a great energy to, that's a great picture, right there is,

Speaker 6:          00:36:22       that's like 1993 five boys, five boys from Brazil, all bad asses at Jujitsu. All five of them. That's pretty crazy. It was crazy, you know, because when Jujitsu exploded, all the Gracies said, I'm going to make my own shit. And they all just made their own schools and hence I went to New York and, and uh, you know how of course the San Francisco and they take their markets and shit and that Horry on did the Torrance thing. That was like the main Gracie place and then all the Gracie started spreading and some stayed in Brazil. The machados man, five boys, five brothers, they all came out and they just opened up a school together and Redondo beach and then the second one in the valley and Tarzana, that's where I ended up going. But man there, it's pretty crazy man. Yeah, that five boys and they're all around the same age.

Speaker 6:          00:37:13       Can you imagine? Pop, pop, pop, pop. You have five boys and they all look, they all look very similar and they're all yoked. They're killers and they're every one of them. Every one of them is a bad asset. Jujitsu, that's pretty remarkable, but the Gracies got, that's, that's just another day in the park for the Gracies like every family. If you're a Gracie man and you've got a Gracie last name and you're not doing Jujitsu, what happened? I want to document. I don't know. That's a good question, but that would be a really hilarious comedy sketch like a Tim and Eric Sketch. The one grace you didn't want to do Jiu Jitsu is one grace. He's just into like dance or something like that happens. Sometimes I bet that you know what? I don't, everyone in the family does Jujitsu and then I want to do this, I want to be an artist or I want to be, and then you try that for a while and you're like, shit, I can make some easy money just using my name and Jensen and then you realize, fuck it.

Speaker 6:          00:38:06       You realize what you have. You know, like you have a great thing. Your whole family are experts. It's choking people and taking their arms and you're choosing this other sheet. You have this life for you right here. So you just want to be their own individual though, you know? But that is a good question. What percentage of Gracie men didn't do g? Zero. Zero. Wow. That would be remarkable. I think they raised him with it from the time they were children. Yeah. Gracie is your last time. You have no choice. You're going to do Jujitsu. That's

Speaker 2:          00:38:36       incredible. Right? It's pretty incredible. So 2003 and we're in Brazil. Giant match. Um, Eddie Beats Gustavo's [inaudible] who was a very high level Jujitsu black belt and uh, he taps him. He gets his back. So I saw that you're pumped up. You know, you, you felt very confident, you felt good and you were, you know, you were zoned in, but the idea that you were going to fight oiler Gracie seems so crazy to me. It just deep knowing what I know about the Gracies, knowing what I know about the history of the family, knowing what a legendary fan with there to see you my best friend standing there with a boiler, Gracie and you guys are about to grapple. I'm like, and we're in Brazil, Mike too. This is a fucking trip. I was starstruck. Thought it wasn't as I was watching some three d TV or something.

Speaker 2:          00:39:24       It feels like you're right there on the mat. And uh, Eddie wound up catching him in a triangle and it was the craziest fucking thing I've ever seen in my life. And uh, it was like time stopped. It was like when you slapped that triangle on him, it seemed like time stopped. It didn't even seem real. And you kept, you kept jailbreaking man, which is why it was hilarious. That dexterity that you have with your legs and you're setting up this alma plot to here and you got them in like full, full rubber guard here. Yeah. That Michigan's trolls at the beginning of the rubber guard, right? Yeah. You, what you had then was the ability to control people. You just didn't have as many variations on technique to attack with, but you had this unbelievable fucking flexibility that a lot of people aren't aware of.

Speaker 2:          00:40:09       You got some weird flexibility and not just flexibility but dexterity like in places that maybe some people can grab their leg and put it, you could put your leg there on its own. But um, there's so many guys that are out there that W it's not that weird flexibility. It's just getting into Lotus. Like if you got into yoga and you've got obsessed with it, eventually two years, three years, five years, you'd have to be able to get into the very basic low disposition. Yes. There's a little more than that fell. Are you being nice? Yeah. That's what it is. I know what you're saying. But the reality is you got some crazy legs, something weird about your legs. Your legs are like arms. They move in strange ways, right? Hairs. If he didn't try to pass right there and if we had just stayed in my guard, I wouldn't have gotten them this one. And a half in this transition. Oh yeah. He got uh, aggressive and he shouldn't have got aggressive. He, if he would've just been conservative, I wouldn't have been able to go right here, right into the triangle, boom over hook.

Speaker 2:          00:41:15       Oh, John Jack right there. That's all Jay. You control that wrist and then slapped it over and now this right here where you had the triangle locked in once here, like right there, I was like, Holy Shit. Because before it was like one of those things where you're not breathing because it's not totally locked in, but once you had it locked behind the knee, I was looking, I was like, how is this guy going to survive? And he's tapping. I was like, he can't survive like no one can. It's a human being when you have a guy your size and you slap a triangle on him this tight. See right here. I wasn't sure Pam there. I knew like when once he dropped out, I was like, Holy Shit, that's locked in. You were screaming, man. Oh my God. And we were the only one screaming because everybody else was freaking out.

Speaker 2:          00:42:00       There's Brazilian TV station. It's set up cameras there. They shut down the other matches so they could better light this match because Hoya grace, she's a hero and they were going to show a boiler. Gracie dominating the first time Abu Dhabi came to Sao Paulo. When you slap this triangle on them, dude, all you heard was me and Jamie Walsh. Me and Jamie Walter yelling out, pull the head, pull the head. Oh my God. Oh my God. It was just madness. Like, Oh shit, what? W We couldn't even believe it. And then once you did pull the head and once he did tap, it was like the world froze. It was weird. It was like a, it didn't make sense. The world just became some new place. The world is a totally new element opened up like the world became a new place. Now all of a sudden Eddie Bravo was a champion martial artist.

Speaker 2:          00:42:53       Well, I didn't win the championship. It doesn't matter. You just have toilet Gracie like you're capable of tapping oil grease. That's championship level shit. He tapped one of the greatest guys of all time. It was, it was a whole new world opened up. It was just all of a sudden it was like, Whoa, this is weird. Yeah, it was, it was weird. It was weird to watch too, man. Cause I'm, when I met you, you're a purple belt, you know, you were really good, prayerful belt and we're crazy moves and shit. And then all of a sudden you brown belt and you were a brown belt and Abu Dhabi Bro. That's crazy. You tapped them when you were a brown belt. So 11 long years go by and this Saturday night they had a rematch. Um, Eddie and boiler had a rematch and metamorris and that's what we were talking to at Gracie about on the phone.

Speaker 2:          00:43:38       They're promoting these professional Jiu Jitsu matches and uh, it's awesome. Keenan Cornelius fought, um, uh, Kevin Casey, Kevin Casey took out. I'll just describe the whole event. Um, a lot of really, really high level fighters. Fought a lot of really good a Jujitsu fighters fought and I'm, the main event was Eddie versus Heuler Gracie and uh, 11 years running. I mean, it's a long time in between matches and there was so much talk, so much, so many haters, so many believers, so many. I mean there's so much back and forth between, you know, the people that thought that Eddie winning the first time was a fluke. And the people that legitimately thought that Eddie has a brilliant mind and a creative mind for Jujitsu that's really unique. And he can come up with a lot of techniques and his deck, like he's talking, he doesn't want to admit that he's got weird dexterity in his legs, but he can move his legs in weird ways.

Speaker 2:          00:44:37       He can wrap you up and triangles and stuff and weird ways without a lot of people have to grab their foot and place it in places. Um, so he has these techniques that he's developed and like really created a bunch of paths like been and a lot of a Jujitsu guys do this. This is not unique. Um, but his past where uniquely his and that he came up with a lot of different techniques and approaches and refined a lot of other approaches that, so he sort of adopted or adapted to Jujitsu. And um, the system in 2003 was really, I'm not even a 10th of what it is now. Um, after 2003 Eddie started teaching and then it became crazy. Then the system started growing and new techniques were added and that there became guys like Denny proper goes who's a a a world champion as a brown belt guys came out of there that we're showing that your, your techniques weren't just for you and your crazy dexterity, but you had broken down things in a way that you know, uh, other people hadn't done before and a weird way your, your, your positions, your very unique.

Speaker 2:          00:45:48       And um, there was a lot of people that do want accept that for whatever reason. And there was all this, oh, he got lucky. Oh, Fluke, oh this. So Saturday night rolls around and I couldn't imagine there being more anticipation in a room before something. And it was a cool anticipation too because one of the things I like about Jujitsu is no one's going to get knocked the fuck out. Even if you get choked out, you know, there's something about like seeing a friend fight. It gets real rough. I mean, we've been friends with MMA fighters, but I've never been as friendly with an MMA fighters. I am with you, you know, I've, but no one, a guy and liking a guy and then watched him get head kicked as hard to do, you know, so it didn't have the date that, that aspect to it, but it was all positive is what I'm trying to say.

Speaker 2:          00:46:31       It was all just holy shit, it's going down. Um, and once it did, there was no points because it's a 20 minute match. So for 20 minutes it's either submission or no points, but in that 20 minutes you swept him on multiple occasions. You've got side control. He never threatened you in any way, shape or form. You swept in with electric chairs. You threatened him with a neck crank and you threatened him with his nasty fucking submission move on his knee. Which I don't, you know, I don't know how he didn't tap cause that was hard to watch man when we were sitting there watching. That was the move. I got you on a high time. Yes. You know that movie vaporizer, that move is so painful. Just that photo shoot, that shit hurt man. It hurts. And somehow or another a boiler just, I mean, look, he's a warrior.

Speaker 2:          00:47:22       He just, he didn't want a tap. He just decided he wasn't going to tap. Um, for people who have never seen Jujitsu before, um, that was like the perfect introduction match because it was so exciting. There was so much madness and there was a bunch of times where you were, uh, you were working on shit and he rolled you over onto your back and then he swept them again. So there's all these like saws when he would role, you'd be on your back. Oh, she, he's on his back. But you on your back is different than a lot of people on your back because that's how he tapped him in the first fight. You tapped him from your back. Your back is, you know your, your guard is crafty. So it was, it was an incredibly thrilling match because there was constant threat at all times and even from him, man, he's still Hoya. Gracie, you always knew. I mean, he's still that champion. If something went wrong, if you didn't dot your i's and cross your t's,

Speaker 6:          00:48:18       I was not sure I was going to win this fight. How could you be sure? It's fucking crazy. I mean, he's oiler fucking Gracie. He never said that. I'm going to go out there and just strangle them. I was just, I didn't know. I hadn't competed in so long. Look right here, I'm faking like I'm going to wrestle because I didn't think he was just going to let me pull them into quarter guard. I thought at this point my wow. He just, he didn't, I thought he was just going to try some totally different ship. But this is what he always does. Every morning before I work out, I warm up on the stair master, I go to Youtube, put Heuler ADCC pick one of his matches and that's how I get that gives me all the motivation. I just watch him roll and he's so good at this. But I thought he would try to pass to the other side. And I thought this position, I thought this position was going to be the hardest to get and this was the key. If I could just get quarter guard in this position, I felt like I could get them.

Speaker 2:          00:49:10       And there's a bunch of crazy rules in this match as well. One of the rules was that boiler was wearing like these skin tight shorts. Eddie was wearing khaki pants. Um, and Heuler was allowed to grab addies ski pants, but Eddie wasn't allowed to grab toilet shorts. So it was weird to watch man. Cause there's times where he's like giving you a Wedgie and pulling on your pants.

Speaker 6:          00:49:30       Yeah, he's pulling them down. I could see my underwear.

Speaker 2:          00:49:32       Yeah. And when and when he got to that a leg lock and he's trying to defend that leg lock and you're tearing his knee apart and he's hanging onto your, your cough.

Speaker 6:          00:49:41       It's saved him. The pat saved him. Yeah. Cause he didn't have the pants. I would have stomped on that foot and got the extra power because he, oh I mean a man, his, I think his knee popped at least seven times. We were talking. I'm like we could stop this now. You sure? He goes, no, I'm fine. And I'm popping. I'm like what about that? Because I'm fine. I'm like, it just kept popping on my damn. Well you sure cause everything's good. I said everything's fine. Like we're talking throughout this whole match. Like right here. He wanted the under hook really, really bad. So I was saying it's hard to get this time. Huh? Cause the first time he got the under under a lot of word that I'm a lot of work cause that's a hard one. It's only because I would rather go against a guy who wasn't really mad at me. If I could joke with you and get like a, like this is just for fun. Right? Right. Then I feel like, okay, I, I can get this guy now because I could win because he's not mad, but it was map. Oh Shit. Like I would never want to find like a Diego Sanchez type guy was mad at me. I'm like, oh no, no, no. I want to find a guy that's like friendly and shit.

Speaker 6:          00:50:43       So it's hilarious. Yeah. So I was just constantly joking with them constantly. And uh, during, like after I swept him, when I get on top of the electric turn, I'm holding, I go, you can't move from here. So just hang on and relax. I need about a minute to rust. And I go, you can't do nothing. Just relax. Because there are some positions where they're, I don't know, maybe three or four positions are like cradles there, like rustling cradles. And it happens here where the guy on the bottom just can't do anything. He's not getting tapped, but he can't move. He's to completely wrapped up. And I used those spots to rest. So, uh, but it's hilarious that you told though, just relax. When me and John, Jack Russel, we are always talking smack to each other. Me and John Jock always goof and we're, oh, it's always a joke.

Speaker 6:          00:51:32       It's always, always me and Sean. It's like a thing we do and I do. There's certain guys that I rolled with that I do that too. I don't like to do it too much to my students because then it seems like, um, acting all arrogant against a guy that I, he's one of my students, he's a blue belt or a white belt that would look really Douchey, playful. But because John Jack can smash me anytime he wants. I talk like I pretend like I'm arrogant cause it's funny because he could do anything you want. So no matter how Douchey I get, we know it's just doesn't make any sense cause he's killing me. But um, uh, so same thing here. I have so much respect for him that, that I feel like I could just joke around with them and I don't want him to be mad at me. Well that's good.

Speaker 2:          00:52:16       That's a good attitude to have man, especially after 11 years between the matches. Um, it's cool that you, uh, you kept that feeling and you were completely destroyed, completely respectful, rather, uh, the entire way up to the promotion of it. Your, your opinion of him, you know, you were, you were like praising what a legend he is and you were very self deprecating about your first victory to um, this was a 20 minute match and because there was no submission, uh, it's a draw. Metamorris is doing a unique thing and they, I don't know if they've got the rules totally ironed out where they want them to yet, but what the, what they're trying to do is discourage people from point fighting. And what that means is work towards submission at all times. And you may get a submission and you may not get a submission, but the, the, the idea is you're, you're seeing real Jujitsu here and they've accomplished that. Like everyone was going for submissions, whether it was Guy Mendez or Hoffa Mendez or you know, Kenan Cornelia is, everyone was going for submissions. Um, sometimes they didn't get them, but it was really exciting because of that because guys couldn't just sort of wrestle to a certain position and then hold. Um, but if this was a scored match, you would beat them handily.

Speaker 1:          00:53:26       I mean you swept him multiple times, you've got side control on them and you had two near submission.

Speaker 6:          00:53:30       This is where he gets the under hook. This is the crowd goes nuts because he was been fighting for the under hood for five minutes and he finally gets it. And this is the position that we're in and our first match. So all the grades it was like, yes, he got the undercuts. So technical that right. He finally got it. And I still have them in quarter guard here so I was a little worried, but you see what I'm doing with my right hand. I'm going under the knee right here. I never really do that and I was keeping him from going, no ham pass. So I'm like, oh okay cool. This is nice. He can't go no ham pass cause I'm holding his leg out like that. And I've never really done that before. This is the first time. It's crazy to see how my left hand. Yeah. She can't go. No Ham pass. I'm holding open his legs, so I felt comfortable. Even though I didn't have the under hook, I just had to somehow get a lockdown, so for my people, they know, they see me fighting like this. All this is every day in the gym. This is how it looks. I start in this position. This is how it looks. So to the Gracie side, they probably thought he was a winning right here. My mom was freaking out. My mom thought he was killing me.

Speaker 1:          00:54:33       This at this moment you got the lockdown somewhere in here you got the lockdown and when you got the lock down here, the crowd went fucking crazy. That was crazy. I get the lock down. My guys go nuts. Yeah. He gets the under hook. His crowd goes nuts. I get the lock down. My crowd goes nuts. That was, it was crazy. The lockdowns way bigger though. The the what? What? For folks who don't know the lockdown. When you got a guy who's really good at it and he has you in half guard and slaps it on your legs in jeopardy, you might tear your fucking knee. You're getting manipulated, you've got two legs against one, and when a guy's really good at it, a guy like Eddie, when they're really good at it and they have two legs against one, it puts you in a precarious position and it's, it makes you vulnerable to a lot of different sweeps. And here you're flipping it backwards. Like that's when the crowd went nuts. Well, dude, you're, you're, you've got his leg in a mangled position. Here

Speaker 6:          00:55:24       is electric chair right here. I didn't think this was the plan. The plan was exactly what happened. That was the plan. I was going to go, just do what I do at the gym every night. This is exactly what I do every night. This is nothing new. It wasn't a special strategy for Heuler. So that was John jocks whole plan is to get me to do what I normally do the best shit I'm, I'm at. Uh, did, did do it out there on him and then

Speaker 1:          00:55:50       reversed you for a second. I didn't have the leg on my shoulders so I go let us go back and boom and get it. So it looked like he swept me. But I went back to put that leg back on my shoulder and I went rock right back up people. Dude, I do it all the time, you know. So now I'm in a position, this is where you rocked it with momentum cause you had full control over that leg. It was just wasn't on my shoulder. I had to go

Speaker 6:          00:56:13       and scoop it up. So now I'm on top and now I'm an, I'm in the electric chair on top and this is where I'm talking to him. I'm like, you can't do anything here. Just relax. This is where I rest. I went through a lot of explosion and I rest right here. I have control of it. That's why he was doing that thing with his hands because people would want to like, why is he throwing his hands up in the air? Like, you know, like he did that a couple of times when you got them into side control and they did that and then I passed the guard. Boom in right here. I'm, I'm still, he's still stuck. I got him in a cradle, but that makes sense now because everybody wondered why he was doing that with his hands. People are like, oh, Hoyle, he was complaining.

Speaker 6:          00:56:44       No, he's complaining because you were talking shit to him. Yeah. You're saying you're stuck here and maybe he was saying, I can't do nothing. He's holding me. He's like, this is Jiu Jitsu we're holding, we're square, we're clinching and squeezing. Right. You know, and he's all like, well, how could he complain about that? He's totally a mobile here. Even though I pass, I pass, I let go the lockdown and passed his guard. The reason why the past was guaranteed, it's because of the control I have on his leg. I have a head and arm and the leg, so that pass was easy. As soon as I let go, the lockdown didn't want to let it go until I rest a little bit. And then finally I let go the leg last and now I'm in side control. And here's the big transition. I thought he was going to turn into me, but he turns away.

Speaker 6:          00:57:22       So I'm like, Ooh, that's even easier. But he's rolling in a nice way. But I had to turn it into a 100% here. So this is halfway. This is a neck crank that I do to get the guy to give me his back. So I'm net cranking them here and if he pulls his left arm all the way out, um, I usually transition to the back and that's what he did right there. So now I'm getting up and his left arms free now. So all I gotta do is get up on my right knee and then swirled in the back. That's what I'm going to do here. I wanted the twister. That was the plan. The plan was to get them in a twister, but he did a really good job of just shrugging me off. So now I gotta start over again. So at this point I'm thinking, this is what I'm really thinking.

Speaker 6:          00:58:01       Um, I thought the most important thing is for me is to go out there and not get smoked and I get tapped in 20 seconds or 30 seconds cause that would be, that would crush me. I would be the worst possible thing. So let's make sure that doesn't happen. And if I lose, if I tap, at least let me go out there and give, we have 20 minutes. Let's see some good 10 planet techniques from my people just to show that it works if he taps it. So at this point I'm thinking I did so much to them. Right. Their Textbook, 10th planet shit all the way through note for note that I thought if he the worst case now if he taps me on one second, at least I got some good shit in my mind, in my mind. Cause that's how much respect I have for right.

Speaker 6:          00:58:45       I'm like he could still get me, I'm not over. We got like 13 minutes. So in my mind I already won. I go, I want, so when you think that way and you're, I thought I already did all this shit. So the worst case scenario, he tasks out. I did a good job. So for some reason that made me just want to attack a more and go, let's just keep putting, let's just keep piling it up. Oh, here's another one, Dan, and see if I could do another one. Oh, here's another one. And the, I just changed. Should it go? Damn. I'm not going to go for a twister. I'm going to go for a vaporizer. So when I, when I get them in an electric chair and he doesn't tap, when I test this flexibility, if they don't tap, I can just sweep them and get on top and set them up for a twister, which I already tried, but I made the decision.

Speaker 6:          00:59:25       I go, you know what? There's a lot. He's pretty good at shaking me off the bat. If I just go to the vaporizer, it'll justice cools the twister. And I do it all the time and that's good enough. So that was the plan. I go, he's not stopping the electric chair. So I'm a go back and get another another. I thought about rubber guard for a second, third, and I thought, you know what? You see how he got the under hood? You see that I went, rubber guard, locked down, whipped him. He had the under hook, but that whip boom, I sucked and wham Bam, that's a little whipped down combo, a very important combo to master. And now I got the under it. So I thought he's not stopping the electric charge tonight because if he would've been able to, he can I, I'm able to do electric chairs easy.

Speaker 6:          01:00:05       So I knew I could just go back and more money in the bank. I knew he couldn't stop it. He just was perplexed here. So I go, you know what, I'm, I got to go to the vaporizers that, which means I got to get his leg over to my left shoulder on the other side. I need to get my head. I want me, I just need to squash his leg down and get on top in a leg drag type position, but a leg drag with a lockdown to maintain control. So right now I'd go back to the electric chair for the third or fourth time and I was really confident at this point. I just knew he wasn't going to tap from the electric chair and I didn't want to pass his guard, get on top and tried the twister. I already made the decision.

Speaker 2:          01:00:42       I don't know what we're talking about here. The electric chair is a move where you've got a guy literally in a full split and he could, you're controlling his bottom leg and the other leg, your, you're forcing it up towards his head. Most people don't have the flexibility to tolerate it and a lot of times they tap just from that. You're like literally ripping their crotch

Speaker 6:          01:00:57       part. Yeah. And, and right here, you know what I didn't get, I didn't get the position I wanted, so I'm letting him get on top so I can set it up again. I go, he cannot stop it. He can't stop my under hugs. I already knew I had him beat on the inside. So I'm, uh, I'm going to set it up again and go back to the cause. I wanted the vaporizer. He foiled to vaporize. I lost control of his leg, so I got to start over again.

Speaker 2:          01:01:21       So all of these times where he's on top, where the audience is, I call the tide has shifted back and forth. This was just you resetting

Speaker 6:          01:01:27       did he could not stop my half guard game. I've just, the confidence just kept growing and growing. So even though he has the under a guy go watch, I'm going to get the under hook back. I was already getting it back. There's no way you could stop it. It see that boom, whipped down. I go, I'm just going to keep doing it. He can't stop it. So, and then I'm going to start all over. I know he's not going to be able to, he's not going to shake the lockdown. The lockdown is too strong. He was never close to ever getting his leg out. I was so confident at this point. I was getting a little gassed and um, I knew I could recover. All he needed was like a little time. So, um, um, to, to uh, hide, uh, the, the gas enos or the gas in is, uh, the fact that I would stop breathing.

Speaker 6:          01:02:11       I'm dying inside, but I would stop breathing. You know, like when Jason Walks into your house and you're in the closet and you're like, but then you'd go, yeah, I was doing that just so he wouldn't smell. Now I did it again. I knew I could do it again. Now I got to get his leg to the other side. I don't want it. Look at it at sea. I'm holding onto his leg. I need to get it to the other side of my body, right? So I'm like, you know what? Damn, I lost it again. Let me, let me do it again. So look at that. I have you do it again. They thought he reversed me, but I go, I'm just setting it up now. I've got the leg over right there. Boom. That's where I want to be. That's the transition right there. And I go, I'm going to go after.

Speaker 6:          01:02:46       It's like, I thought about it for a second there, but I got, no, you know what, I'm going to roll. I can't just reach back for it. I got to have set it up. I'm going to set it up right here. Squash them down. I thought about it again, but then he stopped it right there and I go, okay, let me set it up differently. But then we got broke up here and this is where all the controversial, what the hell was going on here. I knew what position we were in was top stoner control. I knew the position. I'm there all the time. He had no idea what I was doing. So, and he didn't know that. I knew. He thought it was just some crazy weird position. And uh, he didn't know where he was. And uh, I was, I was, see, I pulled guard right here and I was going to say, here, look gimme your leg.

Speaker 6:          01:03:23       Let me throw it over. I'm going to get on top and we're going to go back and I show you exactly the whole thing. I was going to show it. I was going to do it from the top. See, I'm trying to do it from step one, and then I was going to take them over and I was showing him the sweep instead of just getting in the position. He's all confused. He didn't know what's going on. I'm trying to, I go, you got to get your leg over. And he's not, he keeps refusing. I'm like, man, he's not letting me get in the position and look. He's like, no, no, no. And he didn't know, uh, in his defense, he didn't know the position, but I know exactly what's going on. He refuses to get in the position and then I'm just thinking I need to rest a little bit anyways, so this is bullshit.

Speaker 6:          01:04:01       I'm not going to argue like we were just arguing here. He won't let me. I know. Exactly. I, then I decided, fuck that. Fuck this shit. I'm not going to get fucked here. And the crowd was going nuts, so you don't replay replay, replay. And so Scott Nelson looks over right here. He looks over to Hallock and he goes, what do you want me to do? Hallock Hallux said stand them up, start standing and when it like he's going to walk over right now. And I said, what did he say? And then they put the replay on, he goes, hey, Alex said, stand him up. He said, stand them up. And I'm like, fuck that. We're not standing up. And then the replay comes on and everybody looks at the replay and then it just gets down and gets into position. I go, look, look with, I know a position's going on.

Speaker 6:          01:04:40       So he let me have it. See he said, okay. No, no resistance. Once the video came out there was trying to sneak that left knee in. Yeah. Yeah. And this is top stone or control right there. Right there. Stolen a control from the back and there's only half of Tufts. He didn't have your risks before. It didn't matter. It didn't matter. None of this. What I want here is I want him to push me away because I'm going to dip and roll. I'm going to Tuck and roll, but if he holds onto me, I can't tuck and roll. It'd be holds on. So I got to make it look like I want to smash them and squeeze them because I could pass it anytime the past is guaranteed. Do you want the for sure pass or do you want to try to Tuck and roll and go for the kill right away and go after the vaporizer.

Speaker 6:          01:05:19       And I thought I'm going right for the vaporizer. Fuck passing his guard and then he recovers half guard and all that shit. I wanted to go for the kill right here. So right now I'm on my side. I'm setting it up. I need to be up on my knees, but just all I do is need to get up. See I'm getting up. All they gotta do is really get on top, but I know I could get on top of him anytime I want. I know this position, I'm just waiting. Now I'm on my knees. I collected some gas, I recovered, he can't get out. I'm in control here. His legs are all mangled. So what I want to do is turn to my right and roll on my left shoulder. But what I am resting, all I'm doing is rusting. I'm going to turn to my right roll on my left shoulder, but I need him to push me.

Speaker 6:          01:05:56       So I see I'm, I'm selling the fact that I want to squeeze him and I want to see to see and now he's pushing away. He bought it, he bought the fact that I want to squeeze them, so this is what I always do. So now I'm gurgling going like I hate this. Like I hate this, but look, he's going to help me see how we helped me. And he pushed me through. He pushed me through like, Oh shit, it's done now you got this. And I thought for sure he was going to tab. This is the vaporizer. No one has ever not tapped to this. This is in my arsenal, the nastiest leg lock. This is a, it's a calf crank and it's a toe hold at the same time and he can't protect himself with his other leg is other legs were on his other leg.

Speaker 6:          01:06:33       So his other leg is useless. I can use both my arms as opposed to the calf crank from the truck. The calf came from the truck. You can't use both arms for fear of getting onboard with one of them. Yeah. So you need to protect that other leg. Anyways, he's got a free leg to break shit apart. But in from the vaporizer he can't protect with his other leg. It's out of the mix and you could use both arms because there's no arm bar and it's a, it's, it's a leg compression and a told in one, it's the nastiest leg lock in my arsenal and the fact that his leg popped at least seven times, it was popping and crack. And I'm telling them right here, I'm sorry, I'm asking him. I go, dude, we can end this. And he's like, no, see that. He's like, no, I go, we can stop this.

Speaker 6:          01:07:12       It keeps popping. He goes, that's normal. That's normal. I go, it keeps popping. And uh, he refused the tap. He refused man. And I was Yanking, so I thought I'm going to, I was doing things I never did to that they Bryson, I usually just grab the toes with both hand twisted in pool and it's really easy. And the calf crank from the truck. Another thing that you need, you need to stomp your left, the inside of your left foot with your right foot. You got to shove your leg deeper into the of me nasty. But in the CAF crank, you need to stop in this one. You don't need to stop. You could just keep your legs figure for both arms. That's enough pressure. Just leave your legs, figure four. But if for some crazy reason they don't tap like he did, then you would go to the stomp to add even more pressure.

Speaker 6:          01:08:00       But he was holding the Geeky Pant so I could see he's holding my right leg. I need to use my right foot and stomp on the inside of my left foot. I need to pull it up and stomp on it and Matt can get his hands free. I can't get my leg free. You see how he's holding it? But I mean there's, so I decided, you know what, I'm just, I generally don't need to stomp on that foot, so I'm still trying to make him tap like everyone else taps without it, but see how he's holding it. So I grabbed his foot, I'm twisting it and I thought there's like a minute left. I go, I'm going to give it everything. I've got one more time and I just grabbed his foot, something I never do when I twisted it and shoved it, like try to shove it like in his ribs, man. And he still wouldn't tap and gear this popping and he didn't care. He just kept going.

Speaker 2:          01:08:45       He knew that if he didn't tab it would be a draw and that's what he needed. He couldn't have you tap twice. Tap him twice. Yeah.

Speaker 6:          01:08:51       He has nothing. The fact that he's holding onto my geek pants there, that's what's saving him. You know, he crazy. Yeah, he's in serious danger right here. If you had to do it again, would you do with g pants again? Yes. Yes. Because the g pant made those electric chairs so easy. He could, he was never close to pulling his leg out of lockdown. So I mean the pants, the pants were bad for him and a lot of ways, but it saved him might here in this one position. Yeah, it did save him, but I would, yeah, I would, uh, I would have went back to pants anyways with that whole pants scandal thing. Um, uh, asked to wear pants. They said, okay, you can wear pants if you promise not to change your mind. I want it to change my mind. They said, you promised not to change it. And then so they made me wear what I asked for. So, um, I met his lawyer, his lawyer, and it ended up being really, really cool man. The guy that was, uh, trying to protect a heuler from Oh, situations when you're twisting it. Yeah. I'm pushing down and trying to smell.

Speaker 2:          01:09:52       She's obviously in some serious pain here, but it's incredible. He's not tapping. What do you think happened to the knee? If you had to guess it was this some damage?

Speaker 6:          01:10:00       Maybe. Maybe he is knee always pops.

Speaker 2:          01:10:04       No. Say about him. Is that he won't tap to joint locks. Like you remember when a soccer Robin got him in that Kamora and they stopped the fight and he's like, don't stop the fight. I, I'm there all day. I'm fine. Like I don't get tapped from those things. Yeah, man. Um, so like, uh, Hallock said, please don't watch this on youtube. If you do watch on Youtube, please support metamorris just go there and purchase one for 20 bucks. There's a lot of high level matches and uh, people, it's really fun.

Speaker 6:          01:10:32       People kept saying, you were going nuts. We were going crazy. They go, dude, you got to get watch video. If there's video of Joe Watching your match, you were just exploding. Dude. I thought I was going to have a heart attack.

Speaker 2:          01:10:44       I left there, I couldn't talk to people. I ran when the match is over, how to get out of there. Cause I wouldn't, it wasn't, there's no way I was gonna be able to have a conversation with like, you know, like, uh, people on the street, regular folks I didn't know and I didn't want to, uh, have that conversation with anybody. I ran out of there. Wow. Dude. My heart was pounding. Yeah, they said you were going nuts. Were you drunk? No, not at all.

Speaker 6:          01:11:03       Let me sober. Where you one of the guys that that cheered when the lockdown and where you kind of worried in the beginning, cause I was like five minutes of Jochin was never worried. He got the under. You don't when he had the under hook?

Speaker 2:          01:11:14       Nah, I didn't eat. That didn't mean enough because it looked like the same match. It looked like 2003 right. I know too much about your game. I've seen your role too many times. I felt it too. I know. What about, I know that lockdown down is hot death. You get ahold of your leg, man. That's scary shit. I hate that feeling. You're locked down. It's like you're being compressed in between boards. That sort of feels like it's like you've figured out a way to do it and you do it so well and you've done it for so many years that you know the exact correct, perfect angle to hit it where it's like bone is digging in to meet your shin bone is digging into meat and you just do a thing. You know? I like the analogy that you always use with tying your shoes that when you tie your shoes, he tied his shoes every day.

Speaker 2:          01:11:53       So when you go to tire shoes, it's just automatic. It just goes, it's magic. Yeah. You don't even think about it. It's just how he didn't have no command and that just happened on its own. And when you do Jujitsu long enough and you drill long enough and you were in a certain position long enough, you develop that too. You see it with the only forms of movements that I'm really knowledgeable about or striking movements and grappling movements. But you see it in those as well. And I guess you see it in everything. You see it in throwing a football. You see it in baseball. You see it in everything. When someone gets some shit down and they really got it down, like you know like Paul Sass and his triangle, that mother Fucker, you know, if you get caught in that guy's triangle that that dude's been there a thousand times, he's just got, he's got a, just a feel for it. That extraordinary field that rarely happens. Like Ronda Rousey's armbars same kind of thing and you're locked down. It's just death. And I saw that once I saw the lockdown I was like, oh, he's in trouble. Like if he let them get that,

Speaker 6:          01:12:51       we're that confident. Fuck yeah man. You know I would say people were telling me if things you were saying before that matching or predictions and man that kind of stuff scares you. I'm like dude, they like you or shot very conservative. You and John. John have so much confidence in me that that's like man, like the feeling of getting smoked and what you guys would think like damn, like I didn't ever want that. Look in your eye. That, what that, that like third or fourth time that I did a open Mike night where I was getting a little confidence and that one time I went on stage and I thought I'd, I'd thought I'd do something different and not tell jokes but talk about might be like a comic talking about his wife and his girlfriend, but it's not really his wife and it ends up being some stripper and he's delusional and he thinks it's his wife and I try to do that on stage, you know what I mean?

Speaker 6:          01:13:39       Like later, but it was, it wasn't, uh, no one laughed and I got off stage and you were like, come on, follow me. You were like this. We were like, you didn't, you couldn't even look me in the eye did. You're like, no, no, no. You were like, what are we going to do back with me? And you took me the back and you fucking lectured me in a good way. He said, dude, you can't do shit like that. You gotta be a bad motherfucker to pull something like that. No one gets it, dude. You got to tell jokes, he can't get up there and and try to tell a story and it's an open mic night. He goes, dude, I felt like that was like you talk about bombing on stage, eat a thousand Dick's. I felt that what I was trying to do is figure out how I could describe it to you.

Speaker 6:          01:14:22       The reason why I wasn't looking at you in the Ui. So it was when we, I was like, come on, come here man. All I was thinking is how, what is the best way? Cause this is a very sensitive moment and I knew that it'd be devastated. It was a very sensitive moment. So I'm trying to figure out how it look that look, that look, I don't want that look, I don't want that look of, Oh that's chose. Look of how can it be nice to tell me something I did was terrible. How could he be nice? Like if I went out there and the boiler just going ankle lock in five seconds, like right away, just right away. Like let's say I did something stupid. I tried to pull guard and I, I clowned around a little bit for five seconds and I pulled guard and it got me ankle lock and I tap like before even yank and I just happened.

Speaker 6:          01:15:04       It was like early tap. It was the worst possible case scenario. And what would you, you'd be like the same thing it'd be um, I'd be like, ah, Shit. I would just say shit happens bro. Like what could you say? Can you say, I didn't want that look on your face. You know why? You know why? Because you the more shit you talk to your friends and all that about I get Eddie's going to dominate and like John Talks making bets with people. He's betting its house and shit. I'm like, Ooh, like not only you can handle me and you like, dude, you fucked up. But like all that shit you talked, you're like, damn, I talked a lot of shit ends on video. That's not going to look, that's going to stay. I'm going to eat all those words. Fog. So that I think about that shit too.

Speaker 6:          01:15:49       You talk like John John's town, everyone like, like someone from the Gracie family called him up and they wanted to make a bet and John Jackson, you, you want, are you serious how sure I am. He's going to win a bet your house. You want to bet your house, literally bet your house. He made a real bet and the guy wouldn't take it. Ooh, that's, that's crazy shit man. It was when I was a purple belt, I was in the finals of a tournament and John Jack was the uh, the ref and the dudes that my opponent in the final, his coach like John John, you can't rep this match. That's your student. This is ridiculous. And then John John said, okay, you're right, this rough, this match doesn't need a Rep. And he sat down next to his other coach and goes, cause go ahead. Start finding my boy's going to get your boy and an arm bar.

Speaker 6:          01:16:35       It's going to be as right arm. And I, everyone heard that and all of a sudden I'm like, oh no, I'm fucked. Talk about pressure. No one's ever done shit like that. That is a true story, man. That's a true story. So what he sat down, I got the guy in iron bar so he did it because John Jack said it, he says that it's almost like he says it, he wants me to hear it so that I have no choice to go out there and fuck and go to war. You know what I mean? Like I have no choice fucker. You know what I mean? Whatever he has to say to make it happen, he goes, I just put, because I like, I think he, he knows that if there's enough pressure that I'll, I'll be forced to do my game. All he wants to do is play my game.

Speaker 6:          01:17:20       Right. So he had to play some psychological warfare with me and my camp. He, it was all about playing my shit cause how can I get this motherfucker to do what he does here all the time. You know, cause I haven't competed in a long time. I could easily folded from the pressure people get the, you know, jitters 11 years, people fold. This is a huge match, man. 10 planet against, you know, versus a Gracie like right there and our hometowns and, and everyone's screaming and there's some crazy shit, a lot of pressure. My family and my mom, I thought my, my son, my wife was there. I'm like, Holy Shit. My Mom's and my wife's. I was just like a, this is like, like I'm at the MGM granted some main event. I'm like, Holy Shit. That's what it is. So much pressure place was pat my head instructors, all my students, all the shit you talk, John Shock, all of these ev, all this pressure.

Speaker 6:          01:18:08       So I thought, man, there's a chat. People fold under pressure. There's a lot of pressure, all different kinds of dimensions. And will I be one of those dudes a fault? But what I realize is, is that, uh, I do want to, I did want to win. I did want to do my best. That's the most important. Just clear out all the bullshit. Do you want to do your best? Yes. The best thing is to do your shit. Go after them. Trust your cardio, go after. And all those little leaks on this. Damn, that was about to burst with all this pressure, all these leaks I could fix all these leaks and how to do is focused on one thing. Just going after him and trusting myself. Okay, cool. Cool. So then Bam, it was all about, dude, you have no choice. Go out there and fucking make it happen.

Speaker 6:          01:18:50       You know you're not folding under this pressure. You're going to do it and you're going to go after him 100% and you're going to do your best. Did you think about doing it? Hi. No, not at all. No. Too much pressure. Too much pressure. When you're under pressure, I don't suggest inhalation of cannabis. What am I a light edible? No, I didn't even want to take us so much weed in me. I want them. The one thing I learned at John Johnson, I was never stoned when I went to John jocks cause I wanted to make sure we trained at the same time we were going to compete. I wanted to train right. There was that same time, like six 30 ish, seven 30 or seven and that area just get my body going. A million percent shark tank, like a motherfucker getting my ass kick. And I never had been tapped so much in my life going through these shark tanks.

Speaker 6:          01:19:38       It's crazy. It feels, it doesn't feel great to constantly get tapped by people and getting fucking wrecked, you know, trying to last an hour straight with fresh animals, black belts, waiting to jump on you and start on your back and starting the mount sort of bad position. I was getting fucked up dude. And it's the only way to do it though, right? Yeah. Yeah. Um, and the swimming, that was really a fascinating thing that we talked about. Yeah. The swimming, the swimming was important because I'm not a real athlete. I don't ever do cardio. I do Jujitsu for the it, for the fun of it and it, the fact that keeps you in shape. That's uh, that's awesome. Beautiful. Kill two birds with one stone. It's fun. It's awesome. My job is teaching people on a strangle each other and break limbs. Fucking lucky. Embrace that shit.

Speaker 6:          01:20:26       I love it. Uh, competing is different. You're, there were days where I got to see my son, five minutes here, five minutes there, day after day. I'm like, damn, I'm not seeing might son that much. I like, can't wait to get home just, just to get home before he goes to sleep, just so I could see them for five minutes. And Mike, man, uh, my wife's under a lot of pressure. She's handling everything. I'm always training. Everything's on my schedule. Everything is priority is me. And that's not the way it's always been. You know, we work together, but the, I told her this two months, I go, I could lock my way up in big bear and I'd be away from you guys and do it that way. That's a good idea. If people heard I did that, they would think, buck, he's doing the right thing, but, or I could train hard and you let me do whatever the hell I want to do for this match.

Speaker 6:          01:21:12       And I don't want to hear any, uh, I don't, uh, I have to be able to do with without any stress. Cause we have a, we have a baby boy and we, we turn it off. It's a, it's a team. It's a management. I got my time. She's got her time, you know, and we work together. But this camp, I said I can go to big bear and you have to take care of them 24, seven or I could stay here but you still take care of. But I get to see him too in between all this shits. I'm still here with the family as much as I can, but I need you to understand the man. She was just did everything and made sure that my geek, you know, man, she's just amazing and I'm so, it was beautiful though. The training camp was beautiful, so I thought, should I do the Marcella Garcia thing?

Speaker 6:          01:21:57       He's, and he says, I don't do any strength and conditioning. I don't do any conditioning. I just trained you. You'd it too hard every day. I don't know how many hours. See that's what Marcella does. And he gets away with it. He doesn't do anything. Actually, he just does Jujitsu and some sense you've heard that from several people like Pedro, his Oh said that all I do is MMA. That's it. I don't do anything. I was to do any card soccer. Robin ever did cardio, but generally 99% of professional athletes have a cardio program. They got a system and they got trainers and they'd have clocks and they got, they got the heart rate, they got the thing on the heart and then the pull nothing on the arm and it's a science and they master their body and Ooh, look what the body does all its better here and then, and they've mastered that Shit.

Speaker 6:          01:22:38       Uh, Marcella doesn't do that. So I thought, man, it's way better. It's easier, it's lazier. If I, if I just fucking just try to just do Jujitsu. But I thought about that for the first week of camp once it was official, but then I thought, you know what? I don't want to go into this match with any fucking doubts. Let me get my cardio on. The professional tip, you know, for once in your life train, like a professional athlete. I was already lifting weights three years, so I was already strong. I was ready. I go, when I got offered the fight, I was like, Kelly, I'm stronger than I've ever been. I was already in good shape to teach and stuff, but I never did cardio. So I decided, okay, fuck it. I'm going to do cardio. Like a professional athlete. What should I do?

Speaker 6:          01:23:21       I don't like to run. Sign up. You run, you swim or you bike, you know, that's good enough. Uh, for 2003, I did the rock climbing treadmill. Remember that Shit at 25, I can't remember that shit. Right. We did like three minutes and then pop up. I don't remember the time thing. I was just doing rounds. Yeah, I think it was like whatever the rounds were. And Abu Dhabi. Yeah. Yeah. So I don't really remember too much of what I was thinking back then. Again, I never, I just, I did that for 2005. I would, I'll be too, I thought, okay, this is fun. Treadmill, rock climbing. But I got hurt 2005 I would dominate. So this time I thought, and then I started swimming when I was using your pool and I started swimming. I think that was for the palm peanut fight. I go, fuck the Treadmill, rock climbing, let me try swimming.

Speaker 6:          01:24:05       So I'd swim, I swam a little bit. And then that the Katrina had, that didn't end up happening. So again, I'm not a professional athlete, but I decided, fuck it, I got six weeks, let me get my cardio together professionally. We go in there and uh, the one thing I, I decided to swim, go into 24 hour fitness down a big ass clock. I didn't even know what I was going to do. I just thought, okay, well let me, let me do, let me just sprint, sprint or across the pool. See how long it takes. There's a, as soon as the clock hit 12 I sprinted. And it took me either from like 20 to 30 seconds to get across the pool. So I decided, you know what I'm going to do 20 times, I'm going to sprint across the pool and and rest the remainder of that minute.

Speaker 6:          01:24:43       And as soon as the clock hits the 12 Pam spread across again and, and then whenever I get their rest, the rest of the minute and every time they had hits 12 go and I do that 20 times just because we was 20 minute rounds. I don't know. I don't know if it was too much or too little and said, hey, it's symbolic or whatever. So I know sprinting a hundred percent running 20 times is a lot. Sometimes you want to do 10 sprints or you want to do the sand dunes spring up the sand and six times or seven times, I've said 20 times it's 20 minutes. That might not be that much. But what I learned about myself is how long it takes to recover. That was the most important thing I didn't, that would have fucked me up in this fight. If I didn't do the cardio I want to, I would have fell apart.

Speaker 6:          01:25:25       I would've, I would've, I didn't understand how the heart works. So Jen, you know, I've been training uh, consistently since 2003 at my gym. And the way I treated my cardio was I would go as hard as I can. And then once I start gassing, I thought, okay, the rest of this round I'm going to hold on, sit on my ass for maybe five minutes, maybe 10 minutes, depending on I'm not training for anything and then get my second wind and then come back. That's what I thought cardio was, is like you go once you're out of gas, hey, you're out of gas. You're going to need some rest. Settle down for a while. You got far, you've got seven minutes, you have seven minutes before you gas. That's what I thought it was seven. I didn't know about recovery and the mastery of recovery and that gas that you can recover from that easy.

Speaker 6:          01:26:04       You just got to know you can, if you don't think you can, you won't. So by doing those sprints, he gave you confidence that you could use 100% of your energy like around it. I would see you doing like what kind of swimming? Just swim. Basic fucking swimming like a lake, you know what I mean? Your breast stroke like, yes. What is that called? One Rep. Left arm. Right arm. What does it freestyle. Okay. Just like a retard. I'm not bad. You just trying to, I'm just ranting. I'm panicking across the pool. Okay, so by the time, the first time I get a bye, the first one, it's not that I get by like that was the first one I spent it and I'm waiting inside of me and I'm like, I could really just keep going, but I'm just like, this is what I'm doing. So at, you know, after like the third one, I was like, I'm at the edge of the pool. I got this, I got 30 seconds, 35 seconds to recover at the 10th one thinking about quitting after every spirit. Am I good people at the pool, there's old ladies by the sauna there likes to watching this go, Ooh, this tattooed God. Dang the,

Speaker 7:          01:27:13       and I got 10 more to go dying.

Speaker 6:          01:27:18       But I know that. But when there's, when the clock hits the eight I'm dying. When it hits the nine I'm dying when it's a 10 still dying, but damn right before his day 11 take a big deep breath ready to go because you have to go at that 12 and the crazy thing about it is you don't need a trainer to tell you to hurry up because you're going across the pool as fast as you can. Cause you're, you want an a lot of time to rest and recover. You'll racing for that recovery time. So there's no way, I never went a hundred percent I had to go as 100% as fast as I can get across that pool so I can rest. So as you never didn't go 100% yes, yes. I didn't need anybody to tell him. I go, dude, I know I'm trying to rest on that mother about it.

Speaker 6:          01:27:58       I'm trying to arrest. So it makes me, it did. It kicks my ass. I want to quit it for tech. I did a lot for teens, a lot of them. So it's all good. I could do it. I still gained, I made gains the day. I don't have to go 20. I'm like, fuck, I'm not 15. I'm like, I could do fuck five seems like so many. I'm like, fuck, when I'm like at seven or eight and I'm on my blog, I've got 12 more. Ha and you can't stop. You're on a clock. When that clock hits 12 you've got to go. You know? So it's a nightmare. It's torture. No one's forcing me to do it, but I just fucking do it. And I did it twice a week. And to some, there's some cardio machines out there that lap at that. They think that's nothing.

Speaker 6:          01:28:36       And uh, there's professional athletes go to, we weren't, well, that's just because you build up from a base. And these guys have been going at it like that for a long time. Yeah. But what ended up happening? Hah. Uh, I dunno how football player would do it or if that's fucking child's play or whatever. But what it did for my Jujitsu automatically. I knew in the middle of that our shark tank, when I hit that first [inaudible] I knew you just tell yourself, dude, you could recover. Find this place to out conserve your energy. Wait 30 seconds, it's going to come back. And then I'm back. Oh my God. Cool. So at first you're like, oh shit, I want a two weeks ago before I started doing this, I would have said it's over son. I ran out of gas. I'm going to stop. I got, I did good.

Speaker 6:          01:29:19       I got seven minutes, got eight and it's got 12 minutes. That's not the way it was. So out. Keep going for an hour, dude. My muscles would, our muscles would be tired. More tired than my heart. My heart could keep going. I used to be dead after that. That shark tank in the beginning for our, I'll be dead just from the shark tank did. I wasn't even getting that tired after shark tank. That's incredible. There were some, there was times where a shark tank is people. You've said that term a couple times. Um, uh, there's, you know, you get as many guys as you want in the shark tank. It's dedicated at one person obviously dedicated to me on this training camp. I'd get in the middle and they'd be, you know, three to 10 guys sitting around, black belt, purple belt and they're all waiting their turn to get there five minutes with me, like starting on my back, starting in the mouth, all these positions, some like in my guard or I'm in their guard.

Speaker 6:          01:30:07       Just all of these positions inside controlling me on the belly with the under hook on the back a lot, a lot, mount a lot and man, just fresh guys coming in. All my best guys coming in get mangled and tapped and cause I'm trying to conserve my energy. I'm trying to last an hour, but you know, then you're like, dude, you got to trust your cardio. You can't conserve. You had a bad night. I was having bad nights, good nights, bad nights, a lot of shit, Sean shock, you know. Uh, the main thing is I didn't want to go in there and be too cautious and goes 20 minutes. I bet it would be. Cause I would get that way in shark tank sometimes where I'm like, dude I got Sean Ballinger next, I got Jared Carlson, I gotta save my energy with this dude cause I got, I'm looking around as I'm rolling of the shark tank going, Oh my God, these guys are coming after me.

Speaker 6:          01:30:51       So I would just be really conservative and what that would happen that would, I train these killers, right? They know how to close the fucking deal. So anybody pays cautious with you. That's part of the game. You just keep getting deeper and deeper and deeper. And that's what happened. I was just sinking in quicksand with that mentality of trying to conserve and not really attacking cause the attack is what puts them on defense and stops there forward march. So you have to constantly, even if you don't have a game plan right now, just disrupt them. So what percentage do you think your your game improved because your cardio bump? 1000% because now I knew. Now I knew that I would've thought that in and I would dive. As soon as I started breathing hard that it was over done, I did what I can. Now I'm breathing.

Speaker 6:          01:31:36       I didn't know that. You can recover over and over. When the swim sprints, you're reminded over and over your dad and you did another sprint. Your Dad, you did another sprint, you kept going. You were dead at 10 and you kept going. You kept recovering and you recover. Quit. And after, after reminding yourself that you can recover during Jujitsu, during those starts, Angela, you can recover relaxed. You're gonna recover instead of panicking because if you panic and think you can now you had a downward spiral with your cardio, that panic will suck up more than it's going to be harder to recover. Cause you're panicking. You think it's over. But once you get to the point where you know you can recover, you stop telling Yourself, oh, I can recover it. Relax. You just do it. You're huffing and puffing. You're not even worried. There's not even an ounce of panic.

Speaker 6:          01:32:16       You know you're going to come back and that is what that performance Saturday night was all about is knowing that I could recover. That was huge. There were times where I didn't want to see him smell blood and I go, I just need the time recover. I would talk to John John, stop breathing. I'm trying to recover not just John John, how much like time and looking over trying to act like it's nothing, but meanwhile I just want him to relax. We're not doing it. Just relax, relax and there are no, no need to hush now, but those were all mental games, but that was only because I was doing that naturally. It was only because I knew I need a little time to recover. I didn't know the professional athletes shit before. This is like nothing new to professional athletes. What I'm doing is I'm letting people that aren't professional answers and never done cardio.

Speaker 6:          01:33:01       This is what you discover. This is why cardio is so important is understanding how your body can recover. Kendall Grovesite asked me once after he did the ultimate fighter said, learn from Tito. He just said, cardio is everything, man. It's everything. He just couldn't stop stressing and he's like, I'm a different fighter because of cardio. Yeah. If you got the ability to keep going off to your cardio diminishes the ability to recover that, that and knowing that you can recover and having faith in your body. You never panic. You just keep going. You just know this thing. Not that I'm just going to chill here. It's going to co there's back I got now I got power. Now you can throw a combination and then you wait for that green light. Now you can just combination women. Maury Smith, remember Maury Smith? Yeah. He used to do a lot of swimming.

Speaker 6:          01:33:46       Maurice was a UFC heavyweight champion. He was a champion. Kickboxer he was a fucking extreme fighting. Remember he was like one of the first cars. They were winning by head kick. I could barely walk after I was done with 20 I got out of the pool and the main thing is at the very end you gotta walk. You got to keep your body moving. You got, so I would walk around the pony up to walk. It's good to walk when you're super tired. So your body gets used to moving while it's recovering. Yeah. Why is it bad? They'll just lie down. I've heard it's bad to lie down. Yeah, because then your body gets used to having to have everything shut down to recover. You want to be able to recover and still beyond 30% you know what I mean? It's probably better to recover, jog a little bit and then cool down.

Speaker 6:          01:34:28       You know what I mean? And they get to the point now where you're recovering and you never stopped jogging. That's probably the best. I'm just guessing. But for sure when you can barely walk and you're dead and talk to try to walk and to try to keep going, that's the very least you can do for sure. Lying down is not the cause. John. Jack never let me line and get up and keep walking. You want to recover? Because when I would get to that point in the beginning, I would have walked around. I'm walking around in John, I could barely walk. I keep walking, you got to keep the body moving. So it's all basic shit that I'm sure people know. But for the people that have never dove into competing or uh, doing cardio, I'm telling you a 43 years old and I'm just discovering the magical powers of mastering your body and knowing how fast it can recover and when you have that kind of confidence, that's, that's what that performance is all about.

Speaker 6:          01:35:14       Trusting my cardio and I was able to do it. It's about putting in the work. You just put it in a tremendous amount of work, two months worth of work, the cardio work along with all the Jujitsu Shark tanks and all the training and sparring. And Roland constantly spent a lot of time with leg lock defense. A lot of time. Wow. And those guys out there, I was getting help from so many guys at their Max Bishop, uh, catch wrestler out. And uh, and uh, I think he's an Alabama somewhere out there and he's a, I know him through Alan Belcher. He was a got helped him with Paul Harris. He's a lot of guys helped Alan Belcher with Paul hearts. Alan Belcher's DVD immunity. That helped me a lot with, I was, I was on a, I'm on a defensive a mission now I'm on a mission to structurize and just get all the best defense from everybody and that most of it is from John Shock Cause John John Defensively is probably the one of the best ever as defenses is legendary.

Speaker 6:          01:36:13       And so I'm just one by one every position figuring out what are the absolute best defense that things to do or should your hands be, where should the legs be? And when it comes to defense, it's amazing because it's almost a hundred times more complex than offense. There's so much to defense because there's only a few ways to build a skyscraper or you know, to build it right. There's rules, but there's a million ways to knock that motherfucker down. You know what I mean? There's so many ways that disrupt and it's so many different levels. You know, you could come up with all these different angles, so many missiles and demos and all that shit. You know what I mean? Same thing with, uh, techniques and triangles there, the setup, there's so many steps to the setup. So there's so many different places along the way where you could disrupt that.

Speaker 6:          01:37:02       Nip it in the bud at different levels. And then at the end, the one thing I've learned is all these top guys, Alan Belcher, Max Bishop, Eric Paulson, uh, go car to beat you. And I was going to work with them. I just never got around with it. But I did work with Caren Darryl Beatty and from Hyaston, uh, he came down to a shark tank and just fucking wrecked my legs. Man. Current Europeans, a beast. It's about a mother fucker. Oh yeah. So, um, I, I dean a dean lister, we were texting back and forth. I was like on like texting people videos and stuff on my leg lock master friends and they're like Eric Paulson and dean lister and Manny getting parian and all these guys getting their advice every, but everyone has a different way of escaping 50, 50. Everyone has a different way of addressing a straight ankle lock, everything to heal hooks.

Speaker 6:          01:37:50       Everybody's, there's so many different ways to fuck up perfection, a perfect submission, so many different ways. And it's fascinating that there's way more defense in there, his office and all these different things to learn. And then what I'm doing is I'm so fascinated with this, uh, it's, it's just I'm on a quest to make 10 planet just known for their defense and it's fun. It's like a new thing. Like why I'm so obsessed with it, man. I'm on watching defensive videos all the time, just trying to come up with the ultimate defense. And what it does is not only is it making 10th planet stronger as an association, but it's making my game stronger. Why wouldn't I want to be, have like amazing defense? I've always been focused on Gnocchi or fence. That's always been the problem in MMS. What I was trying to fix, that's what 10 plant was all about is what are the problems and MMI, the problems or bottom game.

Speaker 6:          01:38:42       So we're going to be bottom game happy, we're going to be Nogi heavy and we're going to have strikes in the mix. That's the problem. Would you Jitsu. The problem isn't that a Jujitsu guys are tapping on the UFC. There's all these black belts are tapping. We need to fix the defense. Nobody was tapping these black belts. They just were getting beat on their back. That was the prom song. Well, our defense is fine. You keep working on the defense over that Gracie Baha. Uh, we're going to try to fix the pro this, there's emergency Jujitsu is, we needed some urgent care here. We need some scientists on the case and all my students, all my moon heads, my head instructors were all there. All my and our agents and all my science. We need to fix my fucking problem for Jujitsu. Keep working on your uh, uh, passing from standing, which is not a problem. And mmn it's like, man, they can't pass standing. The problem is they're not doing much off their back authentically. And that's what we're trying to do or trying to fix that problem. And um, Ooh, what's that?

Speaker 2:          01:39:40       It's a fascinating thing to watch while she put together this whole system and other other guys inside your system. Watch them add moves. And, and you know, and, and, and build it all and figure it all out and watch it evolve. You know, it's always been intriguing. Interesting too. When I get injured and then come back, get injured, take a few months off, come back, oh no, we're not even doing that anymore. We found a new path. Like there's all these new paths that come up or a new way to get around something. And this cuts to the chase and this is quicker. Someone once made the, uh, the analogy of Jujitsu to chess and a, and most people like love that analogy, but you rejected it immediately. You know, I said, Jujitsu makes chess look like checkers. Yeah. And there's also so many different things involved too.

Speaker 2:          01:40:25       Not just the moves, but also the, the amount of discipline that you have to have to get your body into position to play the game. I mean, you have to like what you're talking about, what you did. I mean, there's not a lot of people that have that kind of willpower to force themselves to do those fucking crazy sprints, to force themselves to do the shark tanks. To force himself to train and when you can barely walk and you feel like you have a heart attack, not everybody has that in them to push themselves that way. So it's not just more, and it's variations in the attacks and the counters and defense, but it's also much more complex mentally and emotionally. It requires more of you. But I gotta imagine man, that like when you put it all together, like what was that feeling like? What was it feeling like when it was over? Look, coiler didn't tap, but you dominated that match. There's just no doubt about it. And even more so in light of what you're saying about how you want the, the reversals, which is, are you adjusting and then you're getting back to that position again. That's how I roll. I mean, um, it's just, it's incredible. It's amazing. What did it feel like? What it feels like when it was all over before hoists? Gracie got it. Got Mad at you.

Speaker 6:          01:41:36       Yeah. What did it feel like? So mad at me and I don't know what he thinks he were talking shit about his family and about toilet. Someone lied to him, someone lied to them because most of them went up to hoists and told. And I want to find out who the hell that says. Someone told her voice that I talk shit on the family and, and uh, you know, maybe he believes that he shouldn't believe it, but he came up to me and uh, but before that you gotta I gotta read you this really quick. Um, you know, let me, while you looking for it now that I found, found him in my first book and the Jujitsu unleashed, it came out in 2005. This was 2005, two years after you tap toilet. This was how I opened this, opened the book with, this is a very special thanks.

Speaker 6:          01:42:21       Goes out to the Gracie family though. We have different views on the geek. I do appreciate tremendously what you did for the world of martial arts and my world. Thank you Heleo for being the warrior, an innovator that you are, who has tougher sons and you know, one thank you Carlos senior for taking in the Machados as sons of your own and introducing them to the fascinating world of Jujitsu. Thank you. Hoary on for producing the UFC. Without you, the MMA industry would not exist and I would still be deejaying in clubs. Thank you [inaudible] for having the courage to step up and fight and eight and 16 men tournaments just to prove the effectiveness of Jujitsu. You will always be a legend. Thank you. Hixon for being the superman of the Jujitsu world. There is no one I would rather see in the ring than you.

Speaker 6:          01:43:11       And thank you heuler for being you without you and you're unbelievable accomplishments and the grappling world. This book would not exist. That was 2005 and after Metamora Saturday night, I was emotional. I was crying. I just went 20 minutes and they're just, it was just, man, I can't tell you. It was like I W I dunno man. It was just glorious. And, um, I got on the Mike and I, what I just read, I just said that again. I said the same thing again on the Mike. I just wanted to let everybody know we all come from the Gracies. We're all Gracie. It's not 10th planet against the Gracies. We're doing this for Jujitsu. The 10 planet thing is to Jujitsu. They

Speaker 2:          01:43:52       don't want to hear that shit though because people don't want to hear that anybody is, you know, they, they'll, they're idea is that no, you know, we don't need your help. You know, their idea is like we're doing this and you're doing something different and your stuffed slugs poke you. And so then I get off stage, hugged my wife, hugged my mom. Um, I mean when I say they're saying that like, you mean I'm being, um, they're not really saying that. No one's really saying that, but there's no one wants to hear that you're, you know, they have pride. No one wants to hear that. You're like, you're trying to fix Jujitsu, you know? Yeah. That attitudes element, Brazilian Jiu Jitsu community that had a dead ignored me. Let's just say that they're just, well, let's be honest though. I mean, it's kind of a tricky situation because no one has more faith than you than I do.

Speaker 2:          01:44:44       No one, no one believes just you're just a unique dude. You can figure shit out. You have a mind for games and you have a mind for, for strategy. I mean, you just, and you're really ridiculously talented, new Jitsu, creativity aside and all the other things aside. But people who didn't know you, they saw this one match and then after that match, they saw you fight Leo Vieira and Leo Vieira, um, basically dominated you on points. You hurt your rib really early in the match and a half way through. He would have still beat me anyways. It was, it was, but what I was going to say is there was after this incredible emotional fight and you know, you beat a legend and then you'd lost to another legend. You got dominated by another legend. So in their mind, they didn't take anything into account. They didn't take into account what a crazy experience.

Speaker 2:          01:45:32       It must've been for some kid to be the first American ever tap at Gracie and Jujitsu competition. I mean it was bananas. The whole thing was bananas. You were crying. I was crying. We were freaking out. And then all of a sudden, boom, you got to fight again. Now you're fighting Leo. Vieira it's like holy shit. Like your whole thought process was around fighting boiler Gracie. Like I remember leading up to it. You just kept talking about to boilers in my division I might fight a boiler, I might have to fight Beutler I mean all the time. What you're training, Euler, Euler. That name kept coming up over and over. No, no, no. So when it did happen and then boom, and you won much like you know when you were throwing up on on Saturday night after the event is over, like this is gigantic dump and release it.

Speaker 2:          01:46:15       So after all that, I went outside the tent and I have this, the tough med. They're my sponsors. They have this film crew following me for this documentary. They're putting together and they follow me. I just needed a place to throw up. I ran out of the place, got on my knees. It's just like throwing up and then I am not the no comes from behind and pours water on me. John Jocks, everyone's following me. I thought it was funny because I actually thought, anyways, I'm throwing up and then I hear this voice behind me and said, uh, is good. You say that about my family,

Speaker 6:          01:46:50       like and I wipe the throw out from my mouth. I looked behind me and it's hoists Gracie. And when someone says that to you that that could be followed with a hug or a shake. Like it's good that you said that about my family. Right, right, right. Well good now. Right? Like what's Max? Is it going to be a pound I had or it could be something else like, because you were always talking shit on my family before and I'm like, what? I never, that's what he said. Yeah. He said it was like the craziest backhanded compliment ever. He said it's good that you said that about my family and I turned around and my, wow. How is Gracie man, that's hoists Gracie. That's like Mike Tyson. You know, the first time you're meeting him? The first time ever talking to him I think, but I've seen him in different places and we've been in the same events and stuff. And um, but um, he uh, he uh,

Speaker 8:          01:47:54       okay.

Speaker 6:          01:47:54       Goes, it's good that you said that about my family because you used to talk shit on my family and I said, I ain't never talked to you in your family. And my first book, I thank all of you, including you. And I'm like kind of pointing out him, I'm a coil or Heleo. I'm telling me somewhat, whenever someone told you about me, they're lying. I've never said it will only a retard would talk shit about the crazies in the G. And that's in the Jujitsu business. You're in the Jujitsu business and you have no respect for the Gracies, right. What they've done. And now just physically, what did he say that, um, don't, don't put your finger at me. And then again on my face like you want me to kick my ass? And John Jock had to get between us to like stop him from like getting in my face cause he thought about now I'm disrespecting him cause I'm like Kinda pointing at him. You know he thought I was, but look what he said. This is the craziest thing of all liquid. He said, let me just quote on,

Speaker 8:          01:48:45       okay.

Speaker 6:          01:48:46       I don't know what fight he was watching. I saw what he said. I'll paraphrase if you want it or not. Try it here. I got it right here. He said, uh, I wanted to talk to them for years but never had the chance to meet him. Hoist, hold MMA fighting. I met him after the fight and he was there throwing up heuler dominate him, dominate him so much. He did so much strength, but he threw up after the fight. Right? How crazy. I told him that I liked what he said after the fight but didn't like the fact that he was always talking trash about boiler and my family. He stood up and started yelling. So I also raised the tone of my voice and told them I didn't like it. He said he always gave my family credit, but I know it's not true.

Speaker 6:          01:49:36       He said he always kept my family credit, but I know it's not true. He always seems, he always talks trash about my family enough with this shit. He said he never talked bad about. My family always gave us credit. He kept raising the tone of his voice. I told him to shut up. So as John Jacques Machado came in and we didn't need this and ask Bravo to leave. Wow. And then he goes, ah, Gracie said he would not compete against Bravo in a grappling match, but seemed open to an MMA fight. Can we slap each other? Can we beat each other up or can we beat each other? Gracie reply to laugh when asked if he'd accept a fight and Metamorris I'm a valid today. Valerie Trudeau fighter. I'm not to score points of fight with time limit. Let's fight with no time limit with punches alive. I'm a valid tuto finer. I don't compete in grappling tournaments.

Speaker 2:          01:50:27       He's the only competed grappling wise. See that one while ed smile fire, right? Yeah. While they strangled him while he put them to sleep. That was her after the UFC. Yeah. So what do you, I mean after all that stuff I Reggie there was in my book and then here like someone's lions to most likely mean, you know, people talk shit and people want to be friends with him, so they probably talk shit to him. He's never talked to you before, so he's never heard you say it. You definitely haven't said it in an in print anywhere. He definitely never set an Nvidia because I know you haven't said it. You were always remarkably composed about that. You know, you were always remarkably composed you, the, the worst you ever did was, um, asked to do it again. You know, that was a few years back. You asked to do it again, but you were never disrespectful about it.

Speaker 6:          01:51:13       Yeah. I thought most people in the late nineties most small Jujitsu players in the late nineties our dream was to go against Heuler. He was the best for that was the pinnacle. Imagine, not only is he the best, but he's the son of Helio Gracie. That's the, like the prints, you know, at one 45. Damn, that was the one that was the one 45. Hixon. So I got lucky enough to go against them once and man, I have a reason to do it twice. Whether it's like the proof that it was wasn't a fluke or that it was a fluke, whatever. It was lucky whatever you want to say. But I thought, damn, I can make this happen. I have a reason to make it happen. Do you want to keep doing this? Do you want to keep competing now? I, if the money's right, but that's one thing I don't even want to get into.

Speaker 6:          01:52:01       Like, uh, the last thing I want to do is stress about my next opponent or, or, uh, uh, a trilogy with them, which I'm not. I'll be open to it. I just don't want to talk and call people out. And what are you going to do with this and what he could do with that. I want no stress right now. That's what I want. I want to spend time with my family, spend time with my students, have fun, enjoy my life right now. I don't know, as soon as there's another opponent and looming now I've got to study is I'm thinking about, I don't want to think about anything. I just want to have fun. I think

Speaker 2:          01:52:34       metamorris has real potential, man. I really do. I think there's something they could do. I think there's something they can do if they keep putting on these match ups like this. You know, when people saw that match between you guys Saturday night, that was exciting as fuck. That was really, really exciting. Yeah. You know, and if they have more matches like that, more a really good high level exciting matches, you get to see real good technical Jujitsu. I think people start to really enjoy it. And the other thing about Jujitsu as opposed to a MMA is, um, if it's especially Nogi, I see no reason why that can't eventually be on television. You know, when I look at like watching Marcelo Garcia match or watch a, uh, jock ra was fighting it out with Dhabi or in any of the really high level guys that compete, not with Dobie, they're fucking murderers. Vinny Magallanes. These guys are exciting to watch, man. It's wild techniques. Chrome Gracie pulls off, you know, it's fun to watch him strangled.

Speaker 6:          01:53:33       Especially submission only. No master Vic Vic Dobby loud. She's Spanish. Joe Rogan. I love that dude. Me and him are actually, our first show is June 1st it's the going to put on a grappling shit going to be on Spanish TV. It's done. Oh Shit. It's called Eddie Bravo invitational and it's going to be two 16 men submission only tournaments. One 45 same day weigh in one 70 same day when and such as sensors for Spanish television. We're going to focus on white people and black people, but we're going to, the spotlight's going to be on the Latin fighters and, and the two Latin fighters, the one we're going to that's already in his Geo Martinez is one of my black belts. Amazing. He's a breakdancer who just killing people. He's going to do the one 45, he's going to be the feature star and he speaks Spanish and all that.

Speaker 6:          01:54:20       And uh, his brother, Richie boogey man Martinez, who's awesome. Awesome. He's a brown belt. He's doing MMA. He's for Roche was talking about Spartan. Both those guys are true. Spartans there. They both have crazy dexterity to yes, they're super flexible. Break Dancers, amazing at Jujitsu and uh, they're tearing it up right now and he's going to be the feature at the one seven. It's going to be at the Florentine Gardens Sunday, June 1st, and then the Florentine Gardens in Hollywood. It's Hollywood. Yeah. Yeah. Sunday, June 1st Sunday. June 1st in Hollywood. We're taping it for TV, so it's, um, uh, but we're getting, you know, obviously we want to pack the place too and afterwards, as soon as we finish taping those two 16 men brackets, we're going to have 10 planet anniversary party there too. It's a giant club. It's, it's awesome. Um, it's a, it's a big venue. So I'm home and where we have, um, now it'd be awesome.

Speaker 6:          01:55:15       And we have like, schools competing against each other. Like we got cold Breanna's best guy. Uh, they say that gonna see, uh, that they're going to give us their best guy. They haven't confirmed anybody yet, but they've all agreed that they're going to send their best guy, uh, Fabi these two over doom school. His best guy. I'm Havi Vasquez, his best guy. Cabrina the Mendez brothers all, you know, we want the best guys submission only 16 man tournament with overtime rounds. Now let me ask you this. Yeah, that's what I was going to ask you. What do you, what happens in a situation like, um, these, uh, th th th there everyone's going for submission only, but there's no submission. So as a draw and fight to just clearly aren't draws. Yeah. Like what do you do? How did you do to effect and Gracie nationals and Gracie worlds?

Speaker 6:          01:56:02       Um, if you're in a 16 man bracket, if you're both disqualified. So the brackets ended up being different, you know, after every, after every a qualifier or that the first bracket you see who makes it, there's going to be some guys that both got eliminated. So you have to restructure it. It's a different, but you can do it and it works great. So if the guys, if you get to a draw, both guys are eliminated. Both guys. If it's the finals, it's no time limit. Oh my God. Yeah. So Gracie nationals and Gracie world, those are the most hard core. That's the hardest tournament to win. The hardest turning all those, all those great ideas. That's all. It's all about submission. But Ebi, which is what we're calling Eddie Bravo invitation. We're going to have Ebi, women, Ebi kids, Ebi, uh, um, Grand Prix. So who, who organized the Gracie nationals is that Rose Rose crazy.

Speaker 6:          01:56:52       Yeah. That's a brilliant way to handle it. Those are the best tournament. And this year Gracie worlds is going to be in Las Vegas at the Cox Pavilion. It's blowing up dude. Submission only is taken over. I mean, if you're a geneticist, when is it? When is it a crazy world? Ooh, it's like a September 21st or something. Damn it. Go to Gracie tournaments. Dotcom, Gracie tournaments.com. It's sometime in December, I think it's the 20th and the 21st of December, I'm pretty sure. Or September, I'm sorry, of September in Vegas. Gracie world's submission only. World's dude submission only. World's, you know, so we're doing the same thing though, but we're not doing it. It's an invitation. We're going to pick 16 guys and 16 guys on one side. 16 guys in the other side. Uh, also the other 10 plan planet representative at one 70 is going to be, uh, Nathan Orchard who's one of my assassins.

Speaker 6:          01:57:47       He's a white guy, but you know, we're accepting white guys too. He's going to, he's going to be at one 72. So we're, we're taking advantage of, uh, Vic doors, connections in the Spanish TV market, which are Jorge's producing this as well or has involved. So, yeah, man. So we're just, we're doing it man. And, uh, first we wanted to do it and do this and give $100,000 to the winner just to ensure if there's $100,000 prize and those guys, what do we got to do to make sure these matches are as exciting as possible? You got to make some serious cash incentives. So that's what we wanted to do. We wanted the first one, we were planning on doing this. We had some investors, got a few of them. It's very hard for people to invest on a first show, but uh, so we decided to do the first one, no money.

Speaker 6:          01:58:33       We're just going to do it for TV and just to get it going. And then hopefully we attract sponsors, but ultimately it's for TV to make it work for TV to ensure that guys don't stall, that there's no reason to stall. You don't have to have, you have to have, um, incentives, all these different incentives that there's no reason for you to slow down, slowing down. It's not helping you financially. You on the training is going to be different for these kind of tournaments. Instead of training for just get really heavy on the passing and the sweeping points tournaments, all you do is train, sweeps and passes. That said submissions. That's extra. You know, you know, you're wasting your time. Just you want to win a tournament all your time, sweeping and passing. That's how you win tournaments. Because we want points. Yeah. Cause that's what I want. But if it's submission only tournament, you still work on your sweet been passing, but you got to be heavy on the submission setups because that's how you're going to close the deal. That's how you're gonna make your money. So that's the plan. UH, June 1st contact master Vick at Eddie Bravo, invitational.com. If, uh, you, uh, you think you're a bad ass, we want the best possible competitors, the Beth, we'll pump it up before you.

Speaker 2:          01:59:39       Well, actually hold the event when it's about to happen. Cool. Have you in here again? Um, what, what was I gonna ask? Um, so this is what I'm going to. And when you, when you come off something like Metamorris huge success, right? I mean everybody was talking about all over the, the mixed martial arts world, Jujitsu world, the, I mean it really made a big splash. Why not do another event on the Internet? Why not do your own events?

Speaker 6:          02:00:00       Exactly. Why fuck around with the television show, you know, cause metamorris there for pay per view numbers. Everyone knows what good paper, if few numbers off for the UFC and let bad numbers and like the efficient numbers come out and go, oh shit, you have c three had papapa 500 pay per views or whatever. And a 500,000 proof of a Jujitsu paper view wasn't as an a big isn't huge digits is like underground. So if you get like 5,000 paper views on Internet, that's pretty good. So the biggest show metamorris day was 9,000 paper views and I was pretty, I think it was the first one we're Haji Gracie fought Shesha this one with all the promotion you did and the hype and all this shit. I'm thinking if they did nine k before there are at least 20, it could be even crazier than that. This one could be 50. I don't know. But you think about at least 20, right? When did they know? I don't know. No, I don't know. I don't know. Do people, I don't know if they tell you, I don't know how it gets out. Well, my thought on it was that if I like 'em

Speaker 2:          02:00:57       RFA, which puts on some great fights, you know, RFA, um, you know, there's always some good matchups um, you, you'd never hear about it. Like an event goes by and you know, you have to search the underground to find results. It's not on the front page. But if you go to mixed martial arts.com, boom, mixed martial arts.com you hit news. The very first picture is bravo dominates Gracie and metamorris three and it's your picture doing this. That never happens in a grappling match. A grappling only match is the number one thing on mixed martial arts.com.

Speaker 6:          02:01:33       That's crazy. That's crazy. Ariel Helwani had me on and he's all about him and my doesn't even like Jujitsu. And he said, he said, I don't even like watching Jui Jitsu. I don't like it. But he said he was, he was thoroughly entertained enough to want me on the show. So I just, I just did his earlier. Why doesn't he like to just some guys just like him, a man, if a good paper view number for Jujitsu is 9,000, but for the UFC, that'd be disastrous. There's a large percentage of the u s or the UFC fan base that is not into Jiu Jitsu.

Speaker 2:          02:02:04       It would be interesting if it got to a point where guys would not have to do MMA to make real money. You know, like there's a lot of guys like Jake shields, a perfect example has an amazing record in MMA, but a lot of people don't know Jake shields. Fucking tremendous grapple. I mean, a tremendous grasp. There's a video and this is obviously a early and John Fitch, his career, you know, John Fitch is much better now, but there's a video of Jake Shields, uh, competing in a tournament at Jujitsu tournament with John Fitch and he fucking sweep some, takes us back, choke some and you're like, wow. Like the way he does it hits the butterflies, sweeps them. It's like fucking Jake shields. Jujitsu is solid. Fuck man. I would love to see a guy like that. Like here it is right here. I mean, he doesn't even necessarily have to compete in MMA because the thing about it, uh, Jake shields, like Jake shields is a, I mean, he's only lost three times in the past fucking 10 years.

Speaker 2:          02:03:03       One of 'em was a, a knockout to Ellenberger right after his dad died. The other one's a lost GSP. And then the most recent one, he got dominated by Hector Lombard. And you see him like compete with a guy like Hector Lombard, especially in, uh, in MMA. And you're like, my God. Like, unless he catches that guy in a submission, look at that beautiful sweet. He was working the Guillotine and he hit that butterfly sweep. But unless he catches a guy in a submission, unless he can get ahold of a guy, he's going to have a real hard time beating a guy like Hector Lombard, like Lombard move. So fucking fast man.

Speaker 6:          02:03:37       Yeah. The way to make it work for TV, for all those millions and millions of UFC fans that don't, that are bored by Jujitsu there, there obviously that's why there's such a big difference in numbers. You got to get those fat. You got to make Jujitsu entertaining enough for them. They liked the UFC. They will like submission, a submission only Jujitsu. I Nogi you can't have the gate. The UFC fan base has not, even though it's beautiful, all the burn Bolo stuff and, and, and tug of war on the pants when they're playing tug of war on the pants. That's a beautiful, complex, sophisticated, amazing, uh, technique. But the people, it's not good for TV, for TV. It's just not good man. As a TV producer that go, no,

Speaker 2:          02:04:24       well John John even said it and he's like, you know, hey man, I love Jujitsu. And this ship puts me to sleep. Yeah. It's, it's hard to watch sometimes.

Speaker 6:          02:04:30       Yeah. It's got, if it's going to be for TV, if I'm, if, if someone said we're going to give you one season and you know a TV producer or a network head that doesn't give a shit about tradition about you just they just want fucking ratings for sure. I would say it's not that we're not going to have anything that that has that can be described by using the word hold. If there's any kind of hold in anything, we don't want any of the grabbing and yanking. Got To get rid of the geese. It can't be a point system it because think about this, there's still a small percentage of the people out there that prefer points over submission only. It's crazy. Now you have two matches, right? You have two matches. Their both. Both matches have a million dollar purse for the winner. Whoever wins gets $1 million.

Speaker 6:          02:05:19       One is a points match. One is a submission only match. Both of those matches. There's a minute left. The, and the points match that the guy on top, he just passed the guard, he's up three nothing and there's a minute left. If you were his coach, the guy on top, there's $1 million on, why would you tell them to go for a submission? Or would you tell them to hold Tom Hall? Fuck yeah, I'd be screaming, hold motherfucker. Especially if you were the coach and you've got 15% of that shit, you already spent that shit. You already promised your wife a new fucking Toyota that was your shit. You would say, oh, there's $1 million. Don't do as a submission would be the last thing on your mind, right? His mind, right. It would be the dose. But if it's a submission only match that end of the match.

Speaker 6:          02:06:03       We look way different. They would both be going nuts for that million dollars. It would look better for TV. It'd be more exciting. Yeah. So that ultimately better for Jujitsu? Yes. So submission only is better for Jujitsu. It's better for TV. You got to, you can't have tug of war. The pants. It's a beautiful thing, but it's going to be a niche thing. It's always going to be underground. That will never be mainstream. That what about a standard outfit? Like you think that you know, I know you like g pants, but what? What about if it was only tights? Only? I think you should do what Abu Dhabi does. ADCC they figured it out. You let them wear whatever they want. They could wear a g if they want, but when you're allowed to wear whatever you want, if you could love the Geeky all you want and worship the Geeky, but you are not going to wear it if you're allowed to, you're not going to give your opponent something to grab onto.

Speaker 6:          02:06:52       In pride, they would allowed anybody to wear it, but none, none of the Brazilian Jiu Jitsu black belts wore their g. None of them never allowed to. They didn't want anybody to grab them. So what you do is no, you let them wear whatever they want. Some people like wearing tight booty shorts. Some people like wearing board shorts, some people like wearing tight spandex shorts to go to the knees. Some guys like short rash guards, some guys like long rash guards, some guys compete and Abu Dhabi and they don't want any rash guard. Well here's the deal though about Abu Dhabi. If I would double, if you're allowed to wear a gay, are you allowed to grab the gay? Uh, apparently no course but you can't grab pants. I was wearing shorts. You can't grab shorts? No, you can't wear shorts. But it's a weird thing man. Cause if I want to ski pants and he was allowed to grab them, but uh, whatever, you know, it's all good.

Speaker 6:          02:07:36       I like all that controversy at the end. I liked that the geek that making me wear the guid backfired on them, but it also saved them because it really like all of those electric chairs, that was all those g pants, man, that [inaudible] pants or there was huge. He could, he never got close of getting out of my lock down. There was no, he never even almost went to quarter guard. That shit was locked in. And the pants were a big deal. A big, big part of it. That's interesting. It's interesting to think of what would, how much different would the game be if you had to wear tights? Yeah. Tights. It would still be hard for them to pull out his leg. And even if I just wear board shorts and knee sleeves, that'd be good enough. You know, um, the question of what the at first find.

Speaker 6:          02:08:17       Yeah. The ankle sleeves are huge too. You put pants, ankle sleeves, or if you don't wear pants, you could just wear knee sleeves. And that's what I did in the first one. That's why I had the knee sleeves. Just you don't want, uh, I mean somewhere I think in everyone's mind they think that, uh, that it's not real grappling. If it ain't all greasy, it's gotta be greasy to be real. And why you trying to stop all the grease and you're supposed to swap sweat with your opponent. You're so, you know, it's like if you were, uh, um, pants, like, oh, you're cheating. Don't you want to be all slippery with another man? It doesn't make any sense. But I mean, don't the pants, you said the pants aid you. Yeah, but he could grab them too. So it was, it wasn't, uh, he had an advantage that he can grab them and it saved his ass again.

Speaker 6:          02:09:03       And I had an advantage where with my personal gain, my lockdown game, it helps it, I wonder if listened to all this, if they did decide to do a third one, if he would say you got to wear shorts, dude, if I did a third one, dude, the first rule is I get to, well with the whatever the fuck I want to wear, that's going to be rule number one. I get to wear whatever the fuck. So that's the first clause. It seems like, um, promoted correctly. There's obviously a market for this now. Um, and like I said, I, I, I, I'm committed to helping. I definitely want to help. I think that something like this is something that I get behind and you know what I'm trying to do, dude, I'm not trying to make money with Ebi. I'm trying to create the best shit, just like you're trying to create with on it.

Speaker 6:          02:09:49       You're trying to do the best shit. There's not like, Ooh, there's a lot of money right here. If I could manage it to show, I'm trying to create the best you just to show. So I want everyone in the Jiu Jitsu community to help pitch in and help me out. Help us out, help out. Metamorris I'm starting Ubi, but I still love them a more and more metamorris and even though, uh, I'm, uh, you know, I'm 100%. I'm not going to be an m four. I still want to go. You say no. What I'm saying? Well when is m four? I don't know, but that ain't happening. It's not happening. It's not happening. Taking some time off. Um, I'm for sure going to take time off. I don't even want to have, it's going to do your own shit from here on out. Um, I mean if you've got 20 k we saw, we saw what could happen with m three metamorris three we saw the potential to, would you say 20?

Speaker 6:          02:10:38       If they said 20 k paper view that that's, that's a lot. I mean, if we're just guessing. No, I have no idea what it was. That's a lot of money I've seen. That seems like a lot of people to buy Jujitsu. I don't know though. So I just, I don't want it to really think about it too much, but when I do decide to sit down and talk numbers, I mean I want to do what's best for the security of my family. That's if I'm going to get back into training camp, I'm going, you know, and start seeing my son last and my wife lasts and distress comes back and I'm training all day and going through all that and swimming and hating the swimming and the torture. If I'm going to go through that, I want what's coming to me. That's it. I just want what's fair.

Speaker 6:          02:11:23       I want to be a dick about it, but I'm not going to get taken advantage of. So I hear what you're saying. Yeah. My man knows his value. Yeah. But I just, I just want to enjoy life now. And the, the thing that feels the best about this is like everybody who's gotten into arguments with people about the legitimate, legitimate legitimacy of the system and the style, the 10 plan of stock, all the arguments that everyone's got into with people in the haters and all that stuff, I think about how vindicated they feel and how I gave them a little boom. I could help them personally. And their argument now when they argue with those same guys are like, ah, like the little I gave him, like I put in, oh, that feels really, really done. That things are all really good. A little dig.

Speaker 6:          02:12:17       Yeah, man. I, you know, the argument, you know, and, and again, all I ever try to do is make Jujitsu better. And the people that are resisting me, and uh, there's so many people on the Internet who aren't Aquest to, who are Jujitsu freaks, who are on a quest to shut me down and they hope the rubber guard fails and the system fails and it's a fraud and they're on a mission and they're generally on. Um, there's, I have on the Uttama Forum, I do frequent the Uttama form. It's the Geeky form, probably the biggest key for him, uh, in the world on a mixed martial arts.com if you go in the tunnel form and I would say 75% of the people on there, they are generally not fans of mine. So I'm like in there like swimming with the sharks all the time, man. I'll respond to shit and I read their shit and there's guys that are just can't wait for something to happen bad at 10 plan and jump on it.

Speaker 6:          02:13:16       They just always going to be haters out there. That shit is such a waste of energy. But the crazy thing is I know all these guys in the fake screen names and who knows what they look like and I know who they are. It's like the same guys. And when I, after the fight I uh, went to my hotel, took a shower and I'm just like sitting there for like five minutes and I looked on the underground and I couldn't believe the headline. It was like a one to a one two punch man who was killed me first. I looked at the headline and it said Bravo dominates Gracie and Metamorris am I want the fucking, it's like the ultimate review ever front page of my that's, that's, that's like my home base man. The underground Kerrick. I fucking love Kendrick man and Chris, Matt.

Speaker 6:          02:14:01       It was crazy. And then I immediately, I didn't even read, I didn't even get on the underground. I went to the Uttama form and I wanted to see what they said. And Man, a Breton, the towel check your oil. That's his screen name. He's always on there. He's like that. He keeps the peace. He's like the, the go between because he also transit Gracie Baha is like that. The peacemaker, cause he won't let anybody trashed term planet cause he's one of my black belts, but he's also training in the Geetu wants to get a ski black belt. So he's the enforcer there. So he starts a thread. Fluke. My Ass said fluke my ass. I was a threat. So I got on to get all them dudes that fucking couldn't stand me. Not usually when something good happens at 10 planet, they just stay off the threat and they're silent and they're just, they don't even want to bump the threat up.

Speaker 6:          02:14:53       They just want to let it go. Just let it go. Let it go. Let that video go. Nice little highlight reel of us dominating like the Gracie nationals, they let that go. No response. Let it go. Let it go. Let it go. Because they know if they hate, it's going to backfire because now more people going to say it. So, but this one, they all responded. They gave it up and it was so crazy. Dude, I'm sitting there, I'll fucking be looking at fucking tears rolling down my fucking face from that shit. Like that is the best compliment Adler ever when guys did. We're on a mission when guys that were on a mission every day to follow me around, fucking just shank me on the side and to have those guys admit that we're wrong. Um, man, I dunno man. That was, there was a combination, that front page and then it was incredible.

Speaker 1:          02:15:40       Don't want to be haters and they, they, they become haters and then it sort, it sort of gets away from them, you know, they just, they almost can't help. It just gets out of control.

Speaker 6:          02:15:48       Joey,

Speaker 1:          02:15:50       Joey Diaz cold. Yeah, but damn you got 18 and I'm going to work in here. Yeah. Hung Up. Shit. T and t doesn't work in here.

Speaker 4:          02:19:32       One thing I do want to stay as the reason I called because I was trained in this morning over in the nod and I heard about all this stuff with boys and I'm just, I don't understand. I'm so upset about it and I saw you being nothing but a fricking class half the other night.

Speaker 6:          02:19:49       Thank you man. Someone must have lied to him. That's all. It's someone. Someone's been lying to them and we need to get to the bottom of that.

Speaker 4:          02:19:56       I don't, I've never heard you say anything with cool stuff about boys, man. You used to talk about him back in the day about how amazing it was that you came to the United States and did what he did. And that has with so many people, it changed the course of martial arts, you know?

Speaker 6:          02:20:15       Yeah. Those are facts. Someone lied to him. The only thing that makes sense, someone had a lie to them.

Speaker 4:          02:20:22       Yeah, man, I can't believe I wish I would've been able to stay. I had to get home to my kids, but if I would have been there, man, God, you know, I could do on my end. I have no idea what my influence would you probably nothing. But if it is just you just ask me, I'll do it, you know?

Like Cirque du Solei drumming. So I always had your back. I always had your back. You know that. Thank you Ricky. Take it easy, Ricky.

Speaker 6:          02:22:00       Great seeing you too, man.

Speaker 4:          02:22:03       Yup.

Speaker 6:          02:22:08       That's what he was asking me. This dude. How good is Joe Rogan? He looks like a fucking destroyer. I bet he can destroy people. Mike, have you seen him kick the fucking bag on video? It doesn't have like 10 million views or something. I don't think it to take care of Ricky

Speaker 4:          02:22:25       ass in person. You can also kick out verbally too. I mean, it's like a fucking these guns in Jiu Jitsu.

Speaker 1:          02:22:37       This is a beautiful podcast. Rikki rocket by the way. He's a bad motherfucker. What'd you rock it from? Poison is legit. Legit black belt martial arts his whole life, his whole life. And a great guy. Super Cool. And he's competed as a black belt. He did the, the world's or Pan Am's and big Ibj judge tournament as a blackbody competed in others. He's told you totally legit. And it, like I said, a great guy. Just a cool guy. Um, let's just wrap it up with our sponsors and play that song and get the fuck Outta here. This is a beautiful podcast. This podcast is the most people ever on speakerphone, ever. We've ever had that many, three different people on speaker phones. That's craziness. It's crazy, man. But it was beautiful. Congratulations brother. It was an honor to be there. I got choked up when people were telling me how nuts you were going.

Speaker 1:          02:23:31       That made, I gave me the chills like, go do. Jo was losing his mind and I was just like, fuck man. Just knowing that, you know, Brian Count can't shut the fuck up. He never shut the fuck up. And by the time we got to fuck with Cha, I still wasn't breathing right. Wow. Like my hands were shaking, my heart was beating and Brian's is blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. Then I said this and this and I was like, I thought guys, you know, he's like doing all this shit and I'm, and I'm, I'm like, Brian, I didn't even know what you just said. Half an hour. I haven't listened to a fucking word cause he was, you know Brian Callan. When you know how, like we've talked about this before, it's like when you're not thinking about nothing, you're background defaults. Did you get to start thinking about Jujitsu when you're sitting around and you start going over move when you, you know, you got 10 minutes before you have to be somewhere and you're just sitting there and there's nothing going on and you start thinking, man, I got to figure out a better counter to start going over there.

Speaker 1:          02:24:19       That's default for Brian Cowen. When you stopped talking, he defaults to gay jokes. He defaults to him talking about fucking guys, you know. And I told them, look, I fuck guys. And he's like, and I remember looking over in the middle of him say like doing his shtick. And I was like, dude, I don't know what the fuck you just said. I literally haven't even heard you. All I've been doing is trying to catch my breath. I almost had a heart attack, dude. I wrote that on Instagram. And it sounds like you know something somebody would say, but God damn, my heart was pounding. It was crazy. I just want you to catch a man, dude. When you, when you went to the truck, when you, when you rolled that left shoulder roll the twister row, which is my favorite move, but the other side, it's not a role that you do that left roll when I knew you were going there, I was hoping you were going to hit the twister.
