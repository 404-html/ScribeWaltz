Speaker 1:          00:00:01       I'll send you a link for four. Here we go. Three dos. Uno. Yes, and we're live ladies champion. Brandon shot with the official Comedy Store Jersey on. That's a real comedy store Hoodie. That's the real shit. It's the real deal. I'm like a doormat. I looked like a doorman. Yeah, I wear those shits all the time. I love them. Yeah, me too. I know. It's only got one mother fucking head of security if you're working in the door. You know what I mean? To answer. I would do a, I'd work though. I'd be a dorm at the comedy store. Especially gave me spots. No, I had 100% sure of that. Yeah. You get those 1:00 AM spots. You don't want them spots or spots or confidence crushers. He'll make you want to quit those. Why am I doing those spots are good. If you Dave Chappelle, they're good.

Speaker 1:          00:00:45       If you've been doing standup forever. Yeah, they're good. If you're Dave Chappelle and then you can walk into anything. Well, the thing about that is like, it's also good for you to be in front of a tired small crowd. Like a tired small crowd is good to test out shit. You know, those are, those are good. I did a, I did a spot, uh, an unannounced spot the other night at the comedy store in the, or it was like half pack and what time, but no, it was fairly late. It was fairly late, but it was a, people were beaten down. It's a different animal. Their energies. Yeah, it's differently. They come in after dinner Hounsell different, you know, you can get fucking real used to like Louis C k you should say that. Like he likes to just show up and even though he was really famous and everything like that, when he was doing this still is right.

Speaker 1:          00:01:29       But when he would show up, what he liked is that they weren't there to see him. So then he would get a more honest response to his material, that fake shit like that. Like when you go on, the guys that go on are the actors that go on like Jimmy Fallon or Jimmy, like anything they say. They say the crowd is, they got that applause sign ready to go. You know what's really hilarious when you watch those guys tried to stand up when they get in their head that they can't then you know like, come on, I can't fail. I'm, everybody loves me. I was in to go up at the store but I'll tell you what man, Michael Rappaport is getting pretty fucking sporty. I saw him do a couple of minutes the other day and he seemed like a real comic and I know he's only been doing it for like a little bit.

Speaker 1:          00:02:21       He did it before and then he got into acting. I think he tried it before, but yeah, he's, he's getting, he's getting good. He's getting, I saw him once and it was, he was struggling a little bit, but it could've just been the crown. But then I saw him recently, I'm like, damn, he's a tall motherfucker til I never realized that he's tall as fuck. He was tall, pretty tall, taller than you. So he's a little shorter than shops to Andre Fili, Andre Fili and miles jury. That's a good fucking fight. Fight. So here we are folks. This is a fight companion. This is ESPN, its first real card, not on ESPN plus this is on ESPN, ESPN, which is huge for the sport and Cain motherfucking Velasquez. My vote for the best heavyweight in the UFC ever. I think that's fair. Most accomplished is Steve Bay for sure.

Speaker 1:          00:03:10       So I mean it's hard for breezy over doing what a fucking record that guys, you get argument forever. Minute. He's got it. There's a good argument for a minute for a [inaudible] being one of the greatest of all time because or the greatest because he tapped into Tarro tap cane tapped, uh, tap fade or I mean, who the fuck is tapped all those guys? Yeah. I mean he's a motherfucker. But as far as what I've seen from like when he's in his prime, well, you know, outside of all his injuries, Kane at one point in time was just a storm. And you know, I talked to, it was really funny, man. We were backstage and I was talking to Bob Cook and he's, and I was like, people want to try to ride that storm out. And they were laughing. Bob Cuccos a storm, never hands storm, never ends, does it with his tenacity.

Speaker 1:          00:03:55       Cardio was insanity. It didn't even make sense. Remember when he beat a jds when it was j d 36 off of them? I haven't been the same. He was on the First Fox card. Yes, it lasted 26 seconds. Yeah, Jane, yes. But he wouldn't, he wasn't good for business. This should not have been fighting. You know that jds. Sure enough, no cane had a really fucked up knee in that fight. First round miles, jury, Andre Fili. And then of course Keynes fighting the scariest motherfucker in the history of the sport, in my opinion. And glass. She could read your list, your cardio machine after Steve Bay. You know, Steve Bay kind of exposed some holes in his game, but you know, the guy's only been fighting for a few steps. He did explosive. But the apprentice is credit that, I mean he fucking ate some big shots but it's steep and he took it unless all five rounds.

Speaker 1:          00:04:43       So he came back and had a terrible fight with Derek Lewis. But Derrick Lewis is a beast and he in that, it was very nervous. It was a bad fight. But then came back and stop Curtis blades. Yeah. Clickers. Curtis Curtis is a mother fucker. He is a mother's worst fight. Derrick Lewis Francis, which we thought there's gonna be fireworks or Paul Daley Mvp last night. Um, no. Do Man Fuck you. Well Paul, you know what I'm a wrestler now do it was crazy. It was, it was, it wasn't good. But it was better than Francis versus Derek think. Yes. Yes it was. There was moments of action. Yeah, there was, there was able to take down. Oh yeah. Which is not going to be Pete. Take him down. Yeah. But it's not as a shit show. It's not good for MVPs. I imagine what Tyron Woodley would do to MVP. Imagine we don't have to worry about it.

Speaker 1:          00:05:31       She doesn't have to worry about it. Cause he's employed in Mcdonald's though his we've another way macdonald, but a real renaissance Fitch, Fitch. But well John Fitch though he's gotta be able to grab a hold of him. The thing about Paul dailies, he fucking threatens a shit out of you with that power. He's got the scariest lefthand in the sport that's left ends. But yeah, 100% he scares the shit out of you with that power. You got to mind your p's and q's. But what I like about page is that I've always said that one day we're going to see a guy who's a fighter who learns how to do other shit. Cause those guys are impossible to hit because their whole thing is lunging in lunging at lunch a little bit, right? When a boy a little bit, but he's more of a kickboxing, a point fighter.

Speaker 1:          00:06:08       Phenomenal. Kickboxer I mean nominal but, but what will you see from MVP is like one of the best fighters that's ever even attempted to fight and it doesn't get touch. He's so good. Championships with real against Raymond Daniels. You should see the two of them fight like Raymond Daniels was another one who was a legit worldclass point fighter and MVPs undefeated in professional boxing. Yes, but the file is he fighting? Well, nobody's, but still the re, the first real fight she had was last night against daily and there was some holes. There were some holes that were exposed. It was way too easy for daily. That's true. He's only certain fights way too easy for daily to take them down. Not that daily dozen. His next fight is going to be tough. What was Chris? Yeah, really tough. But what's crazy is it daily was talking so much shit on John Fitch after John Fish took him down to daily's, all he does is talk shit about guys wrestling and then he took it down.

Speaker 1:          00:07:00       I was like, I literally, I was like, what is happening right now? I was frustrated. I was like, what is happening? Right? We're what's happening right here. Miles. Jury's already busted up. We're not even paying attention. God. Well, you got to talk about fucking Paul Daley. It was unbelievable. And I didn't realize how big MVP was. I didn't know. He's six [inaudible] so tall for this, for that division, and also like uses it. Here's his reaches insane. He does sneaky shit too. He did this like this sneaky right hand. Did he hit him with, he tried to hit him with a hook kick at one point in time. He landed that front kick. Yeah. He's a beast man. If he gets his wrestling takedown defense on point, I mean, he's a phenomenal athlete, but the thing he tagged gift though it is a big gift, but the thing that he, but he goes to London shoot fighters, great God damn gym.

Speaker 1:          00:07:46       The thing that he's missing, you know, I mean, is it just the wrestling, takedown defense just to take down defense? Like if you could take a page out of style, Benders, book style, been around. I'm not too worried about him fighting. Grappling. Right, right. All, he's hard to take down. Very tough take down and you're coming in, you're going to pay it. Yeah. He's so God damn technical. He might be the most technical striker in the sport. I watched him in glory the other day. I was, uh, working out watching some old glory fights with style. Ben, when he fought Jason Wellness, his movement, he's in class. I mean wellness is a world champion dude. How about Roy Nelson and Cro? Cop fought last night to cro. Cop look good. God. What's he, what happened?

Speaker 1:          00:08:29       Cro. Cop wanted decision, right? Yeah. When did he take Roy Jones down or, or how Nelson Nelson. That'd be a safe flight. It look the same till today. Once a Croatian with a black guy talking about Roy Nelson was one of the greatest boxers of all time. The, yeah, they both, they both look like exactly how they look. They, it was like going, Nelson Hits harder than Roy Jones right now. George has tagged Andre Fili. He just tagged him with the left hand. Uh, yeah. I think if you had them on that power meter, I think, uh, I think Roy probably hits harder, but he also weighs 150 pounds more close. He's probably Roy. Roy Jones Jr is probably about 200 pounds these days. But when Roy was fighting shape, God, he was fun. Well when he was at his heaviest, he was about 200 right when he fought. John Ruiz won the heavyweight title.

Speaker 1:          00:09:24       Yeah, that was a phenomenal fight. When you watch that, I mean that was just artistry, speed and precision versus a, you know, a world champion. And John Ruiz who's a real good fighter, he's a real good heavyweight fighter. But Roy Jones was at that time, you know the, the big fucker, the big fuck up. Rather it was going from that fight, dropping down to fight Tarver at one 75 on back down 25 pounds and looking like shit, looking like dude. And Tarver is a monster. He's a monster. And also Tarver and him had gone to a decision in one fight earlier and Tarver thought he won. And you know, Roy Roy apparently had something to say about, you know, why he didn't perform at its best. So when they were faced off tonight and the referee goes, any questions? He goes, God, he excuses tonight Roy. And then he went and knocked him out to have Tara.

Speaker 1:          00:10:17       So he was so, so good. Get back. These guys, forget about Tom. Are you still doing it? Man Steals it was six people. Know what you're talking about. No, Tara and told him the magic man. You don't know. Fight companion fans down now get the fuck total car fans. Now look at this and Roy Jones, we get this sharp jab boxing better than ever right now though. Cause you're, you got fury. Then you got wilder rematch coming up in May. That's happening in Brooklyn. Spoiler work in Brooklyn. Are you working on that? Probably work in that. Am I special? Comes out same way.

Speaker 1:          00:10:57       I know. Um, how did uh, do in 12 new minutes? Go. They don't want good last night. Nice. Right? I'm new minutes or scarify super scan. Also like to when you were talking beginning of the show, there was in my crowd they didn't mark and me beyond none of the, none of those people are my people. And wait, good man. I was so nice. It was weird for me to drive back. This isn't fucking good fight. We're missing a good fight. I know, man. I never, I always have to watch fights when I get back home. I recorded. I know we talked so much shit. I know there's just so we don't see each other, so we got to catch up and shit. Is Miles jury still with alliance? Does anybody know? I know he has his own gym and I think in San Diego and San Diego.

Speaker 1:          00:11:34       Oh, he branched off I think so. He was a dominant cruises stablemate right. They trained together. Oh, feely with a nice right hand dude. Where did I thought, uh, the Francis was going to go to a new camp and I saw he's just training fulltime in France. I'm like the match wrestling and France, but we'll figure it out. Hmm. Maybe just hitting the heavy bag. I mean, where would he go? Like you want them to go to two places? In my opinion, I'd want them to go to either att or Aka. Right. Att a log. They've got enough heavyweights and they have a phenomenal coaching staff. Right. But you want, you want someone big to work with an AK. They're not really gonna probably take him or go to elevation fight team where you got Curtis blades and Overeem who he's fought bolts. Right, right.

Speaker 1:          00:12:20       Yeah. Great coaching at the altitude there. Yep. That's pretty striking Krishna. That altitude training is, it's really interesting. I was talking to Tj Dillashaw and you know he used to think that out training was where it's at until he started working with cal Avida and he thinks that you, you get more work in, I agree with him. Yeah. Working at sea level. Yeah. Cause I, my whole career was in Denver and then when you come to sea level you're like fuck, I can do work. I can put work. Yeah. So like what they're saying is like the amount of reps in the amount of work you do, like what he's doing with Colivida is fucking phenomenal. The podcast I did with him was one of the most informative podcasts I've ever done with a fighter in terms of like how technical his training routine is. His Diet is how everything is broken down to a science as far as like what to do when and when to do what is at another level than anyone else and to see, unless unless someone's on it and they're not talking about, but when TJ talks about it, yeah, there's no one more in tuned with their body.

Speaker 1:          00:13:15       Then Tj, that fucking Aaron Peko and he's getting on that same level because he trains with them, but I asked as teacher, I'm like, why isn't, why didn't you just follow you around? He's like, dude, he has all these people kind of pulling them every which way. I'm like, dude, he should just do what you do. Well, he looked phenomenal, but he got wild. That video. Do you ever see the video of us watching him loose? Yeah, it's crazy. We jumped up. We're all fulfilling challenge. That could have been one of the most viral videos on Instagram, like in the in that week. A number of probably, yeah. That was crazy. That knockout was insane. That was the craziest reaction. Yeah, that knock. I was insane and Callan's given the general view. That was a punch. That was a punch. He hit him with his knuckle fight. That's a fight. That man that was dancing cracks me up. I was like such a silly goose. This is a good fucking fight, man.

Speaker 1:          00:14:12       These guys are so well. Well matched. Really good fight. I did sterling beat Jimmy Rivera. He must have. He was laughing on the way. There's a motherfucker. What happened? Jamie [inaudible] sterling. Anyone who trains I guess in the train room. He's a freak. Super Freak. That's just shows you how good Mala Mariah says. Correct. He's the motherfucker I want to see fight for the title. He too. He's so good, man. When he got against the sun sound, he finished. The Sun's out. No one finishes him. 45 35 35 antimony. Yeah. No one finishes a Sun. Sal. You beat him with a close decision if you're lucky. I asked Tj about and he's like, yeah, I'd fine, but the all they care about the pseudo rematch. Yeah. Unanimous decision. Oh Wow. That's impressive for stroke story. Got Caught. Andre feelies in a bit of trouble here. Oh, she always root for mouse jury, do you? I always do. They're shutting guys at us. Always root for, do you know him? Not that well. We did one show together. That's it. It's getting them out

Speaker 2:          00:15:15       that damn

Speaker 1:          00:15:18       feelies and a bit of trouble here. Interesting. He's pushing them to the cage. Yeah, that is interesting. That's not a good move because he could, he could. Yeah. Push off off the cage with his feet. Can cause a scramble feeling with a nice little hip escape

Speaker 2:          00:15:31       there. Get to guard.

Speaker 1:          00:15:36       Um, what were we just saying? Just before that that happened. Sterling fight. Oh ow. Oh, more eyes. Yeah, man. He's like, he's so good. He Kod Sterling. I mean bad homerun did Aoj Jimmy Rivera in 10 seconds. Yup. Yup. And both with the left high kick, I believe. Oh Shit. That's spinning back fist with their own spinning shit. Now. Hamas, Nick Diaz, he already said, man, he said, I want to hurt nobody. I want to party has done really good for him, man. He has is done. Yeah. Because a Anderson, someone was talking about Anderson versus nick and Connor said, I'll fight Nate on the same card. And then Nick said, yeah, I'm not fighting anybody. I don't want hurt nobody. He goes, I just want to party. That's cool, man. Yeah. He gives her a fucking amazing career. You gotta remember Nick Diaz fought, he was one of the youngest guys to ever fight in the UFC.

Speaker 1:          00:16:28       I believe he beat Robbie Lawler when he was 20. Dude, he's beats you look at his resume. It's impressive. Yeah. The guy said he's flat. He's been doing for a hot second. He's deserved. Yeah. Turning to survive. Hopefully financially. He's good too. What do you think of this Anthony Smith and John Jones? What do you think of this? What are you looking at? Uh, I looked at this guy. I like Anthony Smith. It's a tough go. You like them as a human being. I love you like a person. I don't like him to win. Does anyone ever do that? But that's, that's his story, right? Biggest wins mirror. Yeah. I was in here was a big win. John Jones would do those to man. I, it's, but it's, it's, this is an Anthony Smith thing, the focus on an empty, so it's, it's a Jon Jones thing. I don't know anyone in light heavyweight or heavyweight.

Speaker 1:          00:17:13       That would be John Jones. Damn strong words named Sylvia heavyweight who'd beat him strong words. You know what I'm saying? Like name a tough matchup for med heavyweight. If he just, if he goes, you know what, I'm a fucking heavyweight now. Right, right. Good luck. It's up to like two 40 kilo. Yeah. God, if he gets up to like Jack modified like he was when he was powerlifting. Oh my God. The thing about that is though, like, you know, I talked to Greg Jackson about that and Greg was saying that he didn't like him when he was powerlifting like that. Um, he knocked out Mauricio Shogun Hua. He a knocked out. Rashad lost a Tiago Santos. I want to say that. Was that middleweight that wasn't his first fight in the light heavyweight was Rashad some good wins. He's been fine. He's not a young kid. He's been fighting for a hot second.

Speaker 1:          00:17:59       I mean he knocked out portions of the x factor for shot 70 it's 74 years ago of Rashad. Rashad should should've been fighting. You know, I think we're shot. His heart wasn't in the game anymore cause he retired now. Shot show this job retired and now he's a, we're commentator. He opened up tonight on the ESPN portion, which is amazing. He's shots great when the best guys in this great guy, one of the best. Have you had him on? No, I would love to. I left. Let's do it again. Let's do it together. Let's run a train on podcasts and Trey, we're run a train. I love that. He's such a sweet person. I've had some conversations with them that guys, he's a lot smarter than you might think. That guy, that guy is, he's very smart. He reaches out to me out of like when things are going bad or I'm having an issue, they're like, it's out in the public who reach out to me.

Speaker 1:          00:18:51       Then I always give me like words of wisdom. He's that guy, great, great guy. And you know, you go back to his career when he knocked out chocolate dealt with one punch pub blasts are doing the hard thing was like, I will never forget that because he knocked him out and then he beat Forrest Griffin. Do you know what he's dealing with? What he's doing? What he does the hard thing. Do you know he's doing what he's about to have a heart attack. Sanford and son, Fred Sanford. Oh really? Oh No, it's fun. Funny you remember that? Oh well no, too young. Yeah, I know what you're talking about. But I remember his shot knocked up for us and he was training with us and came back to the gym and at the time I wasn't in the UFC and I was like, dude, got the belt, electric lines.

Speaker 1:          00:19:29       I was freaking out and he was like, I feel exactly the same Brendan. Nothing. I thought it would be everything in more and I want to be exact the same dude. He's like, he was almost kind of like, it's not all that it's meant to be like you think you get to the top of the mountain and it's everything, but he's like, I feel like I'm back here. Dream everyone. He coached against rampage. I was on that season. Oh, that's my season was shot with my coach. How's the second pig on team Rochelle? Rochelle clothes, clothes dude. And when they were in front of each other, you a bitch. You a bitch, bitch. Bitch is back for those like this. This kid go so intense. That whole show was like the fucking, everyone was going to pop off and then he said, was he a division one championship and state champion and not a lot of work? No, not at all. In the all American, all American. His roommate was a great Mannion gray manner. Wow. Hmm. Meanwhile, we're missing a really good fight. There's still going, is this five rounds? No, it's the third round, Bruh. I know if he done fairly well, we should tell people it's at 305130413031 30 to one 31 of the third round in the first fight. Sorry.

Speaker 1:          00:20:42       It's good that we don't give people expectations. What we're going to do here when we do fight companions, I zero expectations. Zero is my favorite podcast we ever do. I like more, more forward to this and yeah. I mean I love doing podcasts with scientists and geniuses and to work though in in a little bit. No, no, it's a different fee. You got to do some research too. I liked doing that though, but it's different feel. This is this. This is this party. So hang out man. This is fun. What are you smiling at? Eddie doesn't believe in science and he's all your bull shit and your science. I believe in science than I can there you could see what your own eyes. Yes. I believe the science of this iPhone. That's real. It's just fear. It's real as fuck. Dude, I was watching this.

Speaker 1:          00:21:29       I was thinking about he did it cause I don't have cable right now because I moved. So we're Winfrey Kim. So all I have is Netflix. I was watching this earth, planet earth and will Smith is the narrator on it. It's all about earth and they're like scanning up and it's astronauts talking about what they saw from space the whole time. I was thinking, God, Eddie must watch this is some bull shit. These liars, those, this, watch this, watch this bull shit. That ain't real. This moon shot. How many hours they had in space, like 72 hours in space. Eight hours. I was like, I bet Eddie saying fuck these. Meanwhile we have no idea who won this fight. Miles. Jury. You think so? Nope. I have no idea. But that's what counts. Good for it. Cause he will, he won't listen to us and he'll watch it in the neck.

Speaker 1:          00:22:11       Miles, jury two rounds to one. You might be right. That mother fucker's late. Yeah. Well he beat him up. He landed late. He's in Burbank. Elliot, I don't know. He didn't say just sit as flatland. The blade. Yeah man. Then MVP fight was bullshit. So I was so pissed and I love Scott Coco. I was going to tweet out something like, you know what, I'm just gonna let them write. Everyone's probably piling on daily. I don't want to be that guy. I'm just going to back out and fight. Didn't end like two shows in a row. Yup. Friday, Saturday. I do that all the time. They have one on paramount and then they have one on zone. I watched it on to zone in my phone. Um, I got one of those design accounts and you know, I was, I was in Vegas for this event my daughter was doing and so I, I heard it.

Speaker 1:          00:22:56       I'm like, I'll be right back. I fuck. I couldn't find it. My daughter was done with her things. I had to run to the top of the stairs and watch that shit. Some bullshit. I said, I told my wife what I was doing. I flew up from the commie strategy hangout field's going to be there. We, which was talked some business about the show. And I literally, I was like, dude, I have to go. He's like, why? Like dude, MVP and daily or finding say Ku. I'm like, I'll pay you later. Let's just talk to mom. I fucking flew home after my set. I get home and I'm waiting. I'm like, what the fuck is you have to zone or did you watch it deserve? Yeah, they got a lot of good fights on that there. I mean I didn't even know what the fuck it was. Daaz it looks like Dayson. Right? Terrible name, but it's a bad name. It's, it's, it's Dazn is to have cable to watch the fight. No, no. You can watch it on you. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:23:46       I just watched, I watched it on my phone cause paramount network you'd have to have like you have to have an account with direct TV or some shit, but to zone he covers whatever paramount fights out. Did that cause people don't have TV no more so people don't, so they got to just have it just through your goddamn app. I literally don't make me get it happened. Then I got to order fucking directv zone as they spent a shit load of money on Canelo Alvarez. They signed him to some multiple hundred million dollar deal. I think it's something like it's like $300 million and he's the highest paid athlete in the world. 365 million. Yeah, some insane amount of money over 10 fights and it's going to be all subscription based. All on does zone. You got to all, isn't that how it's, isn't that how it's gone? The future is no view.

Speaker 3:          00:24:30       Netflix subscription one pay wall. What's interesting is if it's no paper view, it's actually a really good deal. Right? Because I don't know what does own costs a month. I just did the double click on my phone. I didn't pay attention to how much that should cost. Yeah, but what does it cost? I don't. I don't know. It's fine out what it costs for all the bands. If you 70 bucks a month, it's 90 99 you've got to think that if you're watching, if you're watching a paper view, like a big fight like wilder fury to how much is that going to cost? 60 bucks a month, 10 bucks a month, and you can watch fights all the time. It's like my, my take on fight pass. Like if you like fights man, like in my gym I have, I live off of fight pass. You swatch old fights.

Speaker 3:          00:25:08       I watch fights all the time while I'm working out. It's the best thing that you watch. Why would look at Gbi I do. I watched the whole, uh, Gordon Ryan series the other day, the whole little documentary they had. I watched that was working out combat. Did you get to fight ninth is Friday. Oh Shit. La La, right? It has this Friday on you. A UFC fight pass 7:00 PM Pacific. Who, who did you get to fill in for a, was it Barnett got hurt? Barnett's out to virgin got hurt. Verdugo doom didn't get hurt. It was supposed to be Gordon Ryan versus [inaudible] Gordon [inaudible], Gordon Ramsay Manor. So we're going to do, we're going to do for Doom Gordon Ryan, uh, later on this year. But, um, it's a four man combat Jujitsu, absolute at bracket with um, a Uri Somos, who's a arguably one of the, one of the best Brazilian Jujitsu practitioners ever. ADCC medalist, gold medalist, monster, monster.

Speaker 3:          00:26:06       And then the, the second seed is at John Thor blank who want Ebi 17. He wanted the finish the first and only 16 man Combat Jujitsu tournament. He wanted all in regulation, all every fight within two minutes. He said he subbed everybody. So it's Uri and John Doerr blank are the top two seeds. And then if they win their first fights, then they'll fight each other. And then same night, same night though, I'm Kevin Casey, his fighting John Thor blank, Alan Kevin cases. He jumped in and as Stephen Martinez is a local black belt, he's fighting a Uri somos. So on paper it looks like it'll be Uri

Speaker 1:          00:26:44       and John Blank on page or anything can happen in the finals. Plus we got the best Jujitsu girl that's ever lived, only only girl ever to when Abu Dhabi, Ibj JFG and no gay black belt and Ebi be a trace mosquito. She is the baddest chick ever injured. She's fighting combat Jujitsu against Kayla Patterson should be slapping. Awesome. She's going to be, yeah, it's going to be awesome. I might come nice. I like it when someone gets hurt and the tag me, Brendan Schaub get in there like you're at your God damn you fucking crazy. When, when you go back and think about that cyborg fight, would you ever think about doing that again now man, I'm too busy. What? Comedy is so hard. I'm so behind the April. All my energies on this. What do you think about this? What do you think about Pettis fighting Wonderboy? Good for you.

Speaker 1:          00:27:36       Pedes I love, I get great fighters and it kinda crazy though. He's to, it goes from 45 can't make it any more. All the way up to 70 25 precinct about it. Fucking this. How much of a beast? Pegasus fights Tony Ferguson. Amazing fire, right? Tony wins that. He gets hurt. Then fucking, he was like, you know, I've got to get a broke. His hand pedes broke his hand in that fight, so it was a tough fight for him either way. But then he jumps up and he's fighting Wonderboy both use me in a dog in both fights. He's an underdog and both fights. Yeah. Yeah. That, that, that first. And if I was fun Aliya it show. It shows you what? A survivor Ferguson as he gets clipped and you know, he got hurt in that fight and he just grabbed, how about Max Holloway and Tony Ferguson Talking Shit to each other?

Speaker 1:          00:28:21       The, that's the on the, on the dark web. That's the room. I liked that, but I don't like that. Why don't you like it Ferguson versus could be. I want to see that fight, but why does he have to bebes out for, he won't fight in Vegas. He has a suspension, so he's out for a little bit. Tony's ready to go that he won't do the, the, he won't do that thing that Vegas is asking them to do commercial. They're asking me to do a commercial. It was like, you have prostitution, you have gambling. Fuck you. What's the best, so why does it, he's, I guess he's right too. What is the problem with Connor, Tony? What's going on with that? How can that, it's going to be Connor and cowboy. Connor and cowboys had done deal as far as I know, two. As far as I know. As far as that we signed the contract. It doesn't Connor. Tony, make more sense though. Know what kind of cowboys? Great. And Connor, Tony's great. They're both great. They're both great sites. If, if I'm, if I'm Dana, I'm sitting on this. Eddie, you lie. I want to be careful with Tony because you love him, your friends. I'm just saying why not? Cause we'll need Connor that's been here. Works for like two year. Here it is. Eddie, Tony, Connor, Connor. Be a slight underdog. I think in that fight. Tony's a monster for anybody. So I think Tony Max it and cop cars. Connie's get a win. I'm not saying college can be a huge favorite over cowboy, but he's more favorable in that fight. Then he is going, he's a window. He comes back

Speaker 4:          00:29:42       and he needs to, he needs a more favorable fight. And I'm not saying that's a great Matt Cowboy's a motherfucker and you know, fire cowboys on fire right now. He's just so lucid in the zone right now. And Cowboy. Yeah, it's a great fight. That's a perfect stylus screen. That's a better fight for cowboy and Connor. Yeah. Tony's Tony is a great wrestling back then and he's a motherfucker cardio for days and he's crazy. I liked that fight a lot. I really liked that fight a lot. Max Holloway. Tony's Elf motherfucking fight. I love that fight. Marvel studios do superheroes. I think they've run out of superhero. This shit on my hoodies. I don't know who is this? Samuel Jackson is a different superhero now. Who is at the end of the Avengers movie? Hey Samuel L. Jackson say no to some captain marvel, but who is, wait a minute. Captain Marvel's a girl. Yeah, and she and she brings all of them back to life.

Speaker 4:          00:30:40       Wait a minute. Who was captain marvel when we were kids? Uh, dude, wait a minute. I'll look. I don't know. It's amazing that it's not a trans woman. That would be dope. That's what they're going to be enough trans. Who's a weightlifting champions. Yeah. He comes sit down some cheese and wine and cheese. No cheese. People get mad. People get mad. She's chewing on the microphone. We're pros, man. You guys a couple of one, two pros, cheesy dude. If you didn't bring stuff in provolone. Hey, how about this fight? Uzman Huseman versus Tyron Woodley. I love that. That's March 2nd. Come on at. He's now our secondary watch guys, come, come, come to Vegas. Okay, here. Captain Marvel was a guy and a girl in the capital different. She was hot, but that's from 2017 men. This is when it's already been diversified. Captain Marvel, dude, give me type in 1992 Spiderman that just made captain marvel.

Speaker 4:          00:31:40       1956 when I was about this, this spider verse movie that just came out is that it's like only a four year old Spiderman story. It's of, it's not some old thing they brought back. That's a cartoon. The captain captain. Marvel's old school. No. Yeah, but what are those? Spiderman is like a duck, right? He's a pig, bro. It's a great movie. Best movie I've seen in long term Bruce Lee and a superhero and give them like powers. My kids said Nate to the fucking legos movie and what do you want to see? The lego movie that we seen. The other ones, my son loves the Lego movie. Oh, it's the new one. Both of them. A new one just came out. How many have there been to? Only two. Really? So cool. That Batman's a douchebag girlfriend. Right? And then the girlfriend, because Han Solo pulls up in the Millennium Falcon or whatever mistake.

Speaker 4:          00:32:40       Wait a minute. This is the old captain marvel, but he was a damn shot. Zam Zam Zam Zam also known as Captain Marvel terms in marvelous. She's him. Dude. If you held a gun to my head and asked me, it's Shazamm DC or marvel out of cities DC for sure. Yes. Yes. That's what I was trying to say. There was a captain marvel character in the DC comics universe from back then. I don't know. That's what you're remembering, but that's one that existed. So that's the confusion that's Shizam will be looked like. Is that like someone from Bella tour fighting someone from the UFC. Confusing dude. All I know, she comes back and you know how everyone died in the last one. Spoiler, it's been up for now a year or so. Fuck off. She brings everyone back. Then how the fuck she do that? That's the comic books, Dude. Do you remember and Lego movie when Batman, he leaves his girl to jump in the Millennium Falcon with Han Solo and Chewbacca, and he says later he jumped in, he thought he was gonna Party like in space, and then he comes back to what happened.

Speaker 4:          00:33:40       He goes, turns out that he's a dude that was fucking hilarious. There was no chicks because there's no chicks on the middle of the android too to deed. Okay. [inaudible] 68 1968 but scroll down. That's the first appearance was the image of a female girl. 68 two this picture, but here's the deal. Girls weren't built like that back then. They're building. It's a new thing now because those are, until you scroll down, let me see that image that's not like a, Oh, a Primo crossfit chick. That's legit. That's a new version of her. Oh, and I'm in 2012 yeah, that's a UFC fighter chick. Right? Okay. That's what they used to look like. Wow. There's multiple captains on a marvel, so captain marvel, sometimes a guy. Sometimes the girl about it goes both ways. I can relate to it. We're just like, all right, whatever. But they run a silver surfer.

Speaker 4:          00:34:35       There's so many superheros that they have like 10 different ones on Netflix and Amazon ships. You guys watch that fuck fucking wasp girl or some shit. I can't fuck with that. Or aqua man. Get that shit out of me. This is a good fight to Brian Barbarina in vicinity. Luke K is a good fight if we didn't watch miles. Jury, let's be real. Oh, this is a good fight though. For sure. This is a good point. Won that fight. Miles. Jury did a few late feel decision. Yes. To seal it. Even watching the decision. Well, we watched the flight.

So what's your, I mean it's true, but I speak French been eaten. Escar go and throw a nuclear weapons. Would his hands true? This may be true. It's was very dangerous, but he's, I feel like guys, he's got a one, a one shop puncher's chance, but everything else came does, including boxing. He's better at it.

Speaker 4:          00:36:09       I'm just for sure. See what he looks like now after all this time off injury and all that. The injuries are the big ones. You want me to open B? You can open them all my friend. It doesn't matter. All right, let's get crazy. Crazy. What kind of, what did you bring? Anything? I went a little California. I wasn't one Barolo and I decided to go California. I went, I went old standbys standard. Good. One more red one. What do you think of that? Menage a trois. I get from, I think what? I think it's [inaudible] just tag Bob Barbarina would've left hook Barbarino never bring up my daughters. No, no, no different guy. Brian [inaudible] Marina. If you got, if I look a little harder, it's cause I was just at American top team with my friend, my good friend Dustin Poray, Mike Brown and Tiago Alpha didn't make you cut weight.

Speaker 4:          00:36:50       You look skinny. Took a private, went 10 rounds. Dude, I don't, that's the sin. That's cause I can't have any wasted space when I'm doing striking with shack with Chaco Elvis. What did he have you do hit the pads you have. It's great. Kick and head. Low kick. He was teaching. She does. Yeah. It's great. They came to my house. Has Dustin's hip doing, is he all right? He looks, he looks fantastic. He's waiting for a fight, man. Yeah, he was getting some stem cells or something, wasn't it? They need to come up with a good fight. He's so great. He's such a great, good dude. Talk mother fucker.

Katie's fighting someone really good. Oh, it's our post ads.

Speaker 4:          00:37:39       I hope he wrestles. Interesting. Saint Peter, the bar blows is going to go. You like leg kicks. Oh Man. Check these out. You can't see your wrestling thinks he can kick. Fantastic. Let's play like Django and uh, that's when we're showing me like what those, those low kicks there like the details, the details of where you kick your leg up, nerves. Your nerves are so exposed with that. Get Premus what he did to Michael Chandler literally cut his fucking leg and again with Dj and so Hutto first fight or first? First round. The second fight. Ugh. That's a terrible kick. I've never been hit by one of those. I don't know what it feels like. He said worse than kicking the knee. Yeah. You know the thing about kicking the knee, it's hard to fuck your knee up. Like you can hyper extend the knee with a side kick. You could fuck someone's knee up that way, but oh, okay. Just got tagged or no, he's all right. How dare

Speaker 5:          00:38:35       you. Oh, oh. Oh, your kid, dude. If he gets him here. Oh, that was unbelievable. He's got to put that leg hook in. He's got to put it in and flatten them out. Oh yes. Oh No, no. He's on the chin. But Arizona Chin. There you go. Oh, he's cranking that neck. Oh, trying to get choked up. Body triangle. Cranky. So he's now he's guilty. That's okay. It's a beast that's over right there. It's got a hook. The leg that's over right. Maybe not. Maybe not. Maybe weights. He's probably a check that's checking to see if he's okay. Gave him a thumbs up. Oh God. This is the height. Is that fighting Brian? That's from a guy who trained to top team. I can tell you that's a fight. I mean I can top team in coconut grove or wherever the fuck it is. It's such a nice facility.

Speaker 5:          00:39:59       I wish Amanda Nunez walked in and beat the shit out now. I was looking for her. I did see junior desantos walking around and saw junior and that was pretty cool. I would love to see them as much bigger than you. Bubba Jr. I was sick. I took him in. I took him in. Now he's training a lot, but I took him in this way like with your eyes or your mouth. Well, with my book, I outlined in my online with my hands and I was producing estrogen when I saw him. But uh, he, he was, uh, his, he looks, he looks more menacing. Dang man. What am I, he looked at me and he goes, hey, tell shop. I'm not hearing a fucking peep out of him. No doubt. I'll be in Miami March 16th to the 18th to standup. So come see it. Whoa. Yeah. There you go. What are you at Miami and pro? Yeah, I can't damn bro.

Speaker 5:          00:40:48       What the fuck? Evernotes and your club. It's supposed to be haunted. It was so bad. It was so bad. I last, last time I was there, I go, I go, I'm done. I go, I'm never coming back. And they were laughing. I go, you people are too stupid. I go, I can't come back here anymore. They were laughing and he never came back. Never go catch the joke. Never does my answer. No, I did Miami last year. I did a, I did a theater when I was, I had a great time. Just, I'm the only bullshit, but they're, they're a little crazy. I was doing right before my special, I was doing those, a cell phone bag. So they had to put the thing. That's right. So to use your phone you have to leave the theater. So you would think they would just sit down and watch your show everywhere else. That's the case. Not in Miami and Miami. They kept leaving the bar and having a fucking parties in

Speaker 4:          00:41:34       like the greenhouse gases. Yeah. Oh my God. These going back and forth and back and forth. Not too flat ass to be found. Not a flat ass to be found in Miami. And it's my maybe my favorite place in many ways. That's where Tiffany had just, she just had a really bad new year set. She just didn't prepare, I guess. Right. [inaudible] trunk. She's also Doolan movies. There's a sneaky thing that happens, man, when you're doing movies and then you become a huge star. So you're doing these big theaters as well, but you're not really doing enough standard to do those big things. You kind of fucking do mad reps to do big places cause you not the same thing. Are you watching? Yeah. Bang away at his head. Brian by Marina. Oh, big elbow by Lou k. You don't see a lot of Mohawks these days. When I do see one, you know he means business. We're going to just turn and walk, turning away and getting them back to the center. So you're going to deep breath. But when Lucas throwing elbows like that from enclose, maybe he's really good at ovals or maybe heard is a Mohawk. No, none other one. Okay. I can just sit there and kind of take those shots off his gloves and he, Ooh, nice chance he's not ooh elbow, but not afraid to just sit there.

Speaker 6:          00:42:40       Si.

Speaker 4:          00:42:42       Well, he's also probably really tired from the choke and tasks and then the Darcy attempt in the first round. Nice. He's not one of these guys are worried about leg kicks. Are they? Oh, nice. Front kick to the body.

Speaker 6:          00:42:54       Yeah.

Speaker 4:          00:42:55       I feel like front kicks. The body is one of the most underused weapons, you know. That was one of the things I was so impressed with. Barboza in the hang man fight in the Dan Hook fight. Oh my God. Fucking body kit. What's the fucking, oh Paul, a fight. Paul Felder said I was stage a cage side when Paul Felder was taking those kicks to the body from Barbosa. Oh my goodness. And his skin was so red. And I said, I was like, you seem like you didn't even notice. He goes, dude, they hurt. They hurt so fast tonight. Yeah, it does change. That guy's a killer. He's like one, one from fucking, I feel like being that guy. He's a monster man. Yeah, but gauging knocked him cold. Remember the last fight? Yeah. You didn't get to see how you recommend we won like 10 before then.

Speaker 4:          00:43:36       Oh yeah. He's a piece, dude. He's a long, tall dude too. That's right. Gauging off the fuck of knocked the fuck out of him. I've never seen so many fucking foul balls being thrown at. You and Barbara arena have the same chest. They are true. You're so rude. What? Know that it's not a bad thing. I know cars. Barberino mashed my chest, a big chess, getting Brian something nonstop. Brian. Barbara is a professional fighter, but doesn't mean he has a good chance. Painters and granny that are body. Then I'll take my shirt off right now and put it up against, I'll stand right next to him and you tell me if I don't have a better Bob. Do it. Bitch,

Speaker 4:          00:44:21       you got the same chest. Let me see. Throw some punches. Oh, you look better. You look very good. Brian's shredded, but he looked very good. Very good. You're very slim around the forums and the wrists doesn't look what, you'd have a lot of pop two shots. I'm relaxed. No. Yeah. You know, flexing it all choke you the one hand, you're very jacked. You know what's confusing to me is the hand, the hand to risk ratio. I don't see a lot of power coming out of those hands. Take your forums. So they're so small. They're so small. They're like, you could pick locks, you could pick locks with your wrists. He does have a better body though. You do have a better butter camera. Well, no, not the set it up better than Luke. I'm going to get on tier two and then for gay Vicenta Lucchese his name.

Speaker 4:          00:45:12       Gentlemen, please bodies better news. Oh, Luke, better than yours by Rina give you a rescue. Was there playing rock 'em sock 'em robots here, man. They're just standing right in front of each other. You wouldn't you think that Luca would want to take this fight to the ground? I mean, you almost fucking choked him out. Hey, did I get that he's tired. I mean, I, I really do get that, but I mean, I want to see it temps like whiskey, Eddie. It sucks. It's filled with series. You know where it comes from? Thirsty comes from abortion fetuses. Oh, how that, wow. She's brought it dish. Oh, looky with a big left hook. Oh Jesus. These guys are just, I rarely see a fight where guys just standing right in front of each other like that pushed him down. Yep. Did they hate each other? What's going on?

Speaker 4:          00:46:04       Fighters, Bro. Professional fighters. Yeah. True. You don't see a lot of guys just swing in these days. Mm pressive Brian Count. Did you, did you watch MVP versus Paul daily lives did not watch it. And I, I only wonder how someone like MVP will do if he ever goes to the UFC. I want to see him fight guys like me. I'm not assigned yet. Tournament though that belt. It's legitimacy. It is legit as fuck. He's a killer. He's not ready. He's not Michael Venom page. You get no it. And after watching daily take them down, you got to think what Tyron would do to him or would Uzman would do to him or Colby Covington and he was really the shit wrestler. But, but the thing about Tyron, Tyron still legit wrestle with nuclear weapons. It's not just these going to punch you. He's going to put your fucking job all in through the back of your head.

Speaker 4:          00:46:49       And he's a phenomenal boxer, like struck fucking Wonderboy rock driveway, which is impossible to do one. Wonderboy, how about he sat down and tilt down with one shot? Correct. One shot in the fight. Dude. Imagine. Imagine Darren till Mvp. Tyron is like these most Jack. It's like the best body competition. It's like first of all, you got to give it all to the Cuban heel over Merrill winds, best body competition, parish rock colds, right behind them please. Bigger, taller. It's a different thing. He still looks like models. Great. He's got a beautiful body. But when Yoel Romero were talking freak with bikini briefs on you like you're talking to take it. Yeah, that's fair. What is that? Oh, hold my cucumber.

Speaker 4:          00:47:42       And then Brock Lesnar, he goes, hold my d bar and Allister and there'd be, nobody had a better body than over him when he was ubering. Nobody can fail. But he kept bringing up on it. Pretty Boring. No, no, no. [inaudible] was ridiculous. But you're well, just as a, as a perfect specimen, that cute whenever everyone was 265 pounds. Shradda fortunate jazz. When he's standing on the scales and he's flexing, I remember being behind him when he was waning. Just blink and going, what in the fuck am I looking at? What is this? Even Brock closers like what you see Ya, I was so pumped for that fight cause that was his UFC debut and his UFC debut against Brock Lesnar. I was like, I was so pumped for that fight. And both of them went on that saucy sauce. The sauce is like a fucking grizzly bear as well. Where's that wine for wine, Bro? Was that one for you bro? What up, bro? I'm drinking whiskey. I'm doing that too. I thought it was Ireland over there. I didn't free. We're free to do whatever we want. We're, we're Americans. We pay taxes. Can we get, can we get some more whiskey? Men Don't want no more or less. You're good. Oh, right hand by Luke cage.

Speaker 4:          00:49:03       These fights are both all five minutes. Five rounds today. Gentlemen, what's, what's more fun? You can hook them up with more. You're a bad person. Bad Person. Cheers. My favorite, my favorite, we were talking about this before we got here. My favorite, it's the best. It's the best. I love doing podcasts. I love doing podcasts with everybody, but man, there's something special about these. Look that upward elbow, Anderson Silva style dude Anders and we haven't talked to us. Anderson looked good. He looked very good. He looked very good like stopping or didn't be like an old whether they know or something like that was a good go. Yeah, I mean Anderson look a little, I mean he looked a little overmatched in terms of like technique cause style. Bender is a legitimate world class world championship caliber kickboxer but Anderson was hanging in there with them and answer and also try God look at Ariadne behind like good lower.

Speaker 4:          00:50:02       That is reduced to Joe Behind on what? In the fuck. That's so stupid. That's a scares fighter of all time. How do you score this fight? How would you ever score this one? I'm looking at who's going to win this fight it. It's impossible. It's scoring. Very good question. It would suck to be a judge if you saw us in a movie you back. Nobody punches the one at a topic about the ties to things. I watched some glory fights today while I was working out. Two things that Gloria does better than U of c. One five judges, not three. Brilliant to open scoring. Love it. What do you mean open scoring? You know who's noting going on, you know what's going on after every round, the judges have to put up their scores, so if you see a fucking domination and then you see ten nine for the wrong guy, the whole crowd and go, what the fuck?

Speaker 4:          00:50:44       I love pressure on, I love it. I love it. Love it. Two, it's the commission and by the way, you know the best place to to do that kind of changes right here. Andy foster is like one of the most proactive, uh, ahead of the curve intelligent guys in all. And you know, and Bob Bennett over in Nevada is just as good. He's excellent to, they can do this, but if, if Nevada need to vote on it, if Nevada does everybody who was going to do it? Everybody. So we just need to have that entirely true because of the new rules. The new rules are not decide. Yeah, they're not adopted by everybody. Adopted by Nevada. Are they the unified rules in Nevada too? Nevada, Nevada. And I say I just say Las Vegas, Las Vegas, Nevada. And I say Notradame do you say to Martin too much on t.

Speaker 4:          00:51:37       Dot. No, I, I, I've done Chili. Do you say it? [inaudible] I say that and I say quiet and Paraguay. What it what about Afghanistan? Afghanistan, of course I always have enough clothes pull what I say and I say, and I say, Oh God damn it, this fight, this fight. This is insane. These guys are wrong. This is not the way to file a long term career. If you want that $50,000 bonus, you want to play jeopardy when you're 40. It's a bad move. How tough are these dudes? Yo, you know what I saw the other day? I saw a wolf blitzer play jeopardy. He Lo, he ended up at the end of it with minus 40.

Speaker 4:          00:52:19       Oh my God. Holy Shit. Cat. Amazing fight. Both of them look like not there because the clock was off. So in less than two seconds to stop, they stopped. They stopped. You can't, you can't stand and bang like that. They stopped it. That's not good. Sometimes you can. Wow. Raleigh. They said, Woo. She just looked at his quarter goes, whew. Wow. Does he Brazilian too? Did you see fucking, uh, how bad ass or Brazilians just overall just stop. Just stop and think about how many bad motherfuckers came out of Brazil coming out. Europe ain't coming out of Belize. Belize coming out of Columbia. Hold on. There's a few. I'm sure there's a few, but the majority are all coming out of pursuit. How about the hose in Brazil as well? That's just the whole nation hose. Or the girls need help with their rent. Take it easy.

Speaker 4:          00:53:14       It's not, usually they'll have that. It's, it's real. It's real. Get it straight reos real nice. Remember the difference? Cause they're their church is the beach. Look at it. So everyone got to look good in Rio. Mm. Boom. There's the right hand. Boom. There's another neat on the way down. Oh, the mouthpiece went flying. That's it. Stopped it. Get this good. Oh my God. And this is, they had been playing rock 'em sock. 'Em robots for three fucking rounds. You can't fight him. That's crazy. That's it. That's it. Stop it. It's like though. And good for ESPN to the common fans watching going. Yeah. Suck each other in the face. She hit him. Bruce. Head off Bro. Bro. Do you could do that. Do it for Georgia. Nevada state athletic commission adopts new unified rules. Oh, excellent. When does this, what does this labeled? Uh, November 13th 20.

Speaker 4:          00:54:09       So 2018 okay. So they finally adopted it. So they're going to do in this optic. It's do the grounded fighter rule. Oh, interesting too. They took the new rules, but they don't accept the one point down rule glory does that grounded final rule. It's a Gig. It's too gray. It's too much of a gray area. Dude. How about that says fucking Paul Daley protests. MVP loss says bell are rigged it to protect their investment. Ah, Paul daily. You're a monster. When he's, when he's on, he's a monster. There's no man on the planet who, I mean, think about what he did to Lorens Larkin, right? Lorens Larkin is a really tactical striker and Paul daily time he lands that fucking left hand on you. You, you forget your child. Childhood has been fighting. He, he's been disappointed. He says MMA politics and Beltour protecting their investment. I fell in one, three rounds to, to my opinion, I beat that full, really close fight.

Speaker 4:          00:55:06       I can't, I can't see how he thinks he went three rounds. So like if they give to daily Mikaila, fine. We all lost the fans loss. But if you how he says three, I'm like, all right, that's fine. I don't know. It was a bullshit fight all the way around. It was, it wasn't the best fight. It wasn't a lot going on. Well, I've nothing, nothing wasn't the best. Cautious is watching two blue belts grapple daily, kept trying to gala daily, took him down, then he lost position once an MVP got on top of him and beat his ass, got his back. I thought he was gonna choke him out. Me Too. That they had a naked different, yeah. I was amazed that Paul Daley was able to take them down though and we really made some big improvements in his wrestling. I mean, I guess maybe felt like after the John Fitch fight, if you can't beat them, join them.

Speaker 4:          00:55:48       What a great did. This is a great fight, man. Yeah. Wow. Six seconds left. What? Wait, was it 70? Uh, yeah, that's 70 sorry. The House 10 at American top team.

Remember Eddie beat Heuler we were down in, uh, in South Paulo and a Monson got robbed. So Munson to fucking to protest, took off all his fucking clothes and threw a shorts and tennis shoes, like a shade polar bridge. He was so, so big. North south choke, the months choke, you know, I asked Eddie at the time, I'm like, is that in a legit choke? And he's like, I think he kinda gooned them. And it was before Marcello started tapping guys with that. You remember that shit? We used to think that the north south truck was a goon was just, he just grabbed his hand and squeeze the shit out of it.

I think we're almost 50 yeah, probably because he just, he fought chocolate. Dell's a light heavyweight way back in the day. He remembers old school man who is in the UFC at all the statutes. You're seeing a picture of him when the protesters and he's fucking like this and that and he's got that fucking the capitalism tattoo on the back of the and the head gun to the head says capitalism.

Some people were saying online that it was like, like what happens when you let actors write a script? Right, right. Bridget even worse, getting an actor to try to get away with a crime. There are cops, Chicago cops because they haven't seen everything cause they don't cause those guys don't study crime and you're new to the game and you come and you're going to pull the wool over the Chicago police, all those detectors.

Speaker 5:          01:03:10       It's like me. I started fighting a little, I saw some stuff on youtube. I'm going to go and fight. How about, how about, how about they Brian, his boys and they squealed real fast. Quick. Hoggle cops fuck's going on in and give us your phone and let those guys loose.

I will in place. Have you seen a Joe?

Speaker 5:          01:03:58       It's fucking incredible. You have to see. I should about spoiler alert and this should sell you on it. The Dad sucks off the dude who's molesting his daughter and having cetera. Second Mafia. There's the seventies. So why did he do that? Well check cause he had pressure. It's a long story. Long Story. But this guy, this girl drugs her and she wakes up strapped to a bet. You don't know where she has. She's 12 and night for cheese. Holy Fuck Dude. Jack Knife. Cheesing chrome, Gracie talking more custom knives. Tough line of Hudson. I find them on Instagram without giving given to me by wow. Below Donny Vincent gave it to me. That's a work of a hunter. True Work of Oh yeah. Yeah. For Real. That's an inmate tuck. A mark. Gotta calm down. They've got a great Instagram page. Handmade knives. Why is this knife in my hand feel so at home?

This 12 year old girl drugs her, she wakes up, she's strapped up and she's got the speaker next to her and don't tell him, tell him this guy, this guy here this, she doesn't die. Okay Dude, it's so interesting dude. You're gonna, you're gonna f if you watch this, the worst I've

Speaker 3:          01:05:17       ever seen him. She, she gets abducted and this guy, this guy makes her think that she got abducted by aliens. So, and then the aliens tell her he's got this on a tape recorder and she's tied up. She just asked Mr B. He has names. Mr The guy who abducted her and the aliens tell her that she must marry this man to save the world. And if anybody finds out, yeah, well yeah, you have to have, she must have, she must get pregnant by this guy, that guy that abducted her and a sociopath. Yes. She believes it and falls in love with the guy and she's in love with them for like four years cause she thinks she has to save the world. He got her to think she got abducted by aliens. What do you think is happening when people say they get abducted by aliens?

Speaker 3:          01:06:06       I can't get, I think it's, it's uh, um, some, um, people, uh, high level people doing experiments and getting them there. They're abducted them. They're not being abducted by aliens. They're being abducted by people who make them think they're getting more and more interested in more. Obviously they were just dreaming because nothing happens to the physical. You know the thing about the alien abductions and no, there's no evidence of, you look at lay people that have been alien abducted, like there's no evidence they actually leave their house. There's no like there's no hope, no alarms go off and see what happens is we believe that really have a hold on when people sleep, when people sleep, your brain produces all these chemicals that make you dream, right? So all of these alien abductions, almost all of them, this is a great cheese, three Kelvin, those cheeses, alien, these alien abductions all take place while people are sleeping.

Speaker 3:          01:07:01       It's real simple. They're laying in bed at night. They have this unbelievable realistic dream. They also have what's called sleep paralysis. Sleep paralysis is something that afflicts people where their semi awake and they can't move their body because your body, your body's just like in a half state of dreaming and awake. We called Rem sleep. So during this time your brain is producing dimethyltryptamine. You're, you're producing DMT. So you're tripping your balls off and you're having these weird fucking visions and you think your board space ships and shit. That's a possibility. But after watching this documentary, another possibility is that there, there, I'm drugging people and making them think they use day getting. It could be anybody, bro. It could be anybody. There is no, they did. Everybody's cool. Bruce Buffer, grown gray, monochrome. I'm more excited about this fight that I am the main. This is a coma. No, tell her debut is like almost a Coleman and this is probably the coal man. No, this isn't a Khomeini. Felder floater. Vick looks finish and just ready. He's a beautiful looking human, handsome, beautiful. Ever seen his dad and his mom does. Mom was a as well. She was, yeah. Wow. Gracie,

Speaker 5:          01:08:15       level of girl that he would marry. Think about that. Think about that. Who's doing Eddie? Are you chewing on the microphone? Don't do that. Don't do that. People get crazy. Good thing I don't read social media and this kid is, this kid kills it. This guy's to be, this is a bad motherfucker. He's a Vegan and Crohn's. A pescatarian. So this is one for the people that don't read. I'll take pets. Please move it over to the fish. A pescatarian thing I read me hurts me. Do pescatarians eat octopus guys, I'm open to any fish eating a dolphin. It is, dude. I, they're too smart. They can feel are smarter than Dolphin. So he didn't alien. I don't need it anymore because I, after I thought, here we go. Here we go. Come on. We'll pull guard. Pull. Yeah, he'll get his clothes go out.

Speaker 5:          01:09:08       Chrome Gracie's closed gardens in insane so he will pull Gumbs submitted me from close guy. Yeah. He submitted to believe that he submitted Jimmy. He submitted JT tours. He's one of the best guys out there in Abu Dhabi. 2013 in China from close. What? I'm surprised he's not, he's not taking his dad's approach, which is that front leg side kick. He does that. No, no he, oh shit. He hit him in the left hand. He heard him Crozer oh shit. He's throwing some Kung Fu cause Sarah saw some wild shit. He's got so much more experience. It's so crazy fucking hammers. I wouldn't mind if he just shot for Gotcha clincher dude. Fuck yeah. He's going to have to pull guard here. He's not going to be an easy take down. He's got a sense of grace. You four minutes to work. I need that last time. He's going to take your bag show Benevidez took a guy down three or four times in his last fight with legit move. Different animal though. He's a different animal on your back. This is a real world class of mission strangled. Oh No. God is all over the ice cream. There's no way he's going to survive. He's fuck you just know. You just hold that, hold that on. Shut your eyes. Get full structure and he's got three and a half minutes. Shack and if viewers corner, man, what'd you, you're fine.

Speaker 5:          01:10:43       Oh Shit. It's over. Right, right. Listen, I bet everybody could call. It's over now. Now it's 100% job set now it's completely fuck Alex. Is Sarah so hot his head like what the fuck dude? He, Alex just shook his head like what the fuck that is the

Speaker 3:          01:11:14       kind of sister Khabib phenomenon. Admit as he touches you, you're, you're done. No touching on. That's a different thing. He chose people out like no, no, it's a different thing. I mean not like that. He just gets you in punches this 25 minutes. This is a certain flow, Lemmy sound when people chew cheese on microphone. That's really disgusting. Dude. That's so crazy. How good he is. Look at this shit. He's so good. Look at this. He'll pull guard. Just basically pulled guard right here to the ground. He's world class, man. It's a different answer. She wouldn't do that. You wouldn't take a guy down. Like if it was a wrestling match, it's this slow squeeze header. Gracie's doing a breakdown of it right now guys, check it out. This is how it would happen. Right now. We're gonna go with the breakdown breakdown that's so on, but he's been graced with amazing where they read, they could choke the shit out guys.

Speaker 3:          01:12:02       It's a huge win. That's a fucking big deal, man. Sarah's is a good fighter, but he just know crazy Jujitsu. Let's, let's go a step by step. You break that shit man. Fuck is a spot. Um, shakes in there. I'm sure you know he's, he's maybe not even watching. He's like surfing in Rio or some shit. You might not even know he was there and the most beautiful Brazilian. We know. Dude. There's no way I want to meet him. I want us to talk to him, but there's no way that they wouldn't show Hickson that you never met. Hixon we can set it up. My friend, I love him. I want to meet him. He had the most interesting description of how he finishes people. He goes, we started a neutral point. He goes, and then we'd go to one and he goes, when I moved to one, I'm not going back to zero.

Speaker 3:          01:12:49       He goes, I'm moving to two and then to go back on then checkmate. Yeah, and just going back, he's also, he's the fucking confidence that confidence is a blue cheese. What does it, some, some sort of a, he brought a blue cheese when you're ready. Now are we all going to shut our ready already got this beautiful cream, creamy French. But then the crisis though, that's going to be too much on the podcast. Don't even eat onions or your best case. That like a weird thing. I don't need it. I don't need that onions either. You and I have a lot in common. I love him though, right? Oh yeah. Okay.

Speaker 3:          01:13:31       Yeah. I mean, I'm not on John's knows doggy style. The right just missionary. No, I sure do. I'm an American man. Why wouldn't you eat ass dog style American prefer we preached her legs up under the cheeks down like Gene Simmons. You touched the bud a little bit and then that's, that's weak side. You go doggy style eating ass. Let them know you love him. Know what's up. Okay. For New Year's Eve, look at, look at, look at Crohn's hair. Handsome bastards like his hair. He just lets it go. School to Culver City in the house. Got Out of grade school, got out of his, uh, out of the shower and just shook it. Shook it out. You know it's in Culver city. I just want to let you know that the earth is flat. Oh No, please don't do that girl. Oh Dude. He's way down. He calls me up out of the blue.

Speaker 3:          01:14:26       He got it by now. You still feel that flat earth there. You didn't want you to go for it. You need to go back, go back, go back to standard glass pills for Santa Claus. And then finding doesn't say we're off of it. Then you go back to Santa, cause I'm not even trying, I'm not going to try and make a joke. I thought you were off. If some reason nobody goes off it. What's your flag? And he's off spaces. Santa Claus for adult now Eddie's off it. But he has a following now of flat earthers so he casts not shows. That's not true. He called his bluff. You call his bluff on flat. You can't say it out loud. Give me that. I can't eat. You can't eat crackers on here. Never go to draw the line there. This is a softer cheese and I'm, I'm getting this beautiful knife.

Speaker 3:          01:15:02       A little bit tarnished. We are going to have to clean it. Kron Gracie, a shout out. You know, I was uh, I was uh, a little concern with chrome's fighting career cause when he was on my podcast when we were discussing flat earth, he said that he doesn't know if, if fighting is for him. There's a lot of pressure, the family pressure. And he was basically saying that he likes living without any pressure and he doesn't know if he wants to keep fighting. But now you know when you listen to the countdown show and the all that embedded stuff, he said no. He said, you know what? I realized that just teaching is like every day is like groundhog day and I'm not at my best when I'm just teaching. I'm not my best when I'm training for something. So I always have to be trained for something.

Speaker 3:          01:15:43       So I didn't realize, I realized I need to be fighting. So when I heard her say that, know he's evolving and figuring himself out. So this, this might be the beginning of some championship shit here for the UFC. Listen, if he gets his striking together and he did tag because Sarah's with a couple of punches. Everybody who goes to the ground with this kid, it's, fuck, what weight class was this one? 40 45 yeah, but guess what? Good luck would Max Holloway Holla at your boy? Yeah. Ooh, look, I would love to see, this is to my, why do we do this? Why are you going to say fucking Brian Ortega versus chrome? This was 45 40 45 oh shit. You know when he was, when he lost, when he was 12 years old. Um, he wasn't that into Jujitsu is a little, he was, he wasn't, he was skateboarding.

Speaker 3:          01:16:29       He was skateboarding and I, John, jock. We were outside of the tournament and John Jock, we were walking and Kron Gracie at 12 came bias and skateboarding started doing some tricks and John, I'll never forget the John Dracos. That's the one right there. That's the one that's going to take over. Wow. I really, John's rock knew it cause he's really tight with Hickson and a common sense. How long is a crime been striking? Do we know? Well, you know, I mean he's years, five years, six years. He's been doing MMA fights. He fought and rising, you know, he fought a few fights. The thing is like his striking his, like his father striking, it's just to understand it. It's not really to do it in terms of like, he's never going be close distance or

Speaker 4:          01:17:10       get better to jail. He's never going to stand in back. Yeah, to close distance and then grab you. And once you went to a year in big truck even could be these district more than crone. Crone is just going to get in and clinch up and like you said, go from step one, step two, step three, not go backwards. He's dangerous. Can you just, it's gonna be tough to beat. It's fuck yes. I wouldn't have been disappointed or shocked if Alex Caceres escaped a couple times on the ground and maybe stood up again. Maybe crone got them in the third round. I wouldn't have been that surprised because Alex Concentra's, he's been fighting for so long. He squirly on the code. That's not an easy, and you only have four or five gate and some good guys, you may remember when he beat Sergio Pettis, they look at that when Anthony Smith knocked out shogun.

Speaker 4:          01:17:53       Meanwhile, how good did it fuck it. Shogun look in his last fight, Shogun has made some sort of a crazy resurgence, man. Seriously? Yeah, man. His last fight. He was so savage who was so savage and so did he pull up who shogun fight? Fuck someone. Good man. I thought he got Merk. No, no, no, no, no. His last fight, he won by stoppage and he looked like a fucking animal. He looked like the Shogun of old. Those old guys who keep doing it. Like, what's that? I said Pedro Tyson. Pedro. Oh, that's right. Or the mother. He's a motherfucker. Trey. He beat me in Australia. Is this Guy gonna Fight Jon Jones. That's what we're talking about. This would be a highlight. Who would this gentleman be? I don't know. Smith. He's a beast man. He ends up being knocked out. Shogun. He's a beast. He knock out.

Speaker 4:          01:18:36       Shogun owes de Mer. Rashad, he's a beast. He, he's, he's a very, very good fighter and I think he's the type of guy that's going to rise to the occasion. I mean, I like, I like, I don't really heads that. Yeah, I don't know if he's, oh, how tall are you? How tall is he? I worked for the organization. She looks scary. I don't know if he's a capable of beating John Because I legitimately feel like John is not just the best light heavyweight of all time. I think he's absolutely in the conversation for the best fighter of all time. I agree. There's three or four guys that are in that conversation.

Speaker 4:          01:19:07       Mighty mouse, who I think is the best representative of martial arts I've ever seen. Candidate. There's no, no, I mean Keynes, the best heavyweight have ever seen, but the best fighters I've ever seen, I think fate or is in the conversation, and I think Anderson Silva, when he was in his prime, when he was in his prime but prime, he was a savage man. He was an assassin. Look at this. Cain Velasquez showing up purple. Look at, look at the suite, not purple jacket. Woe. Lo can look Rockhold and Daniel Cormier, he said when he was healthy, he was the baddest man on the planet. Well, DC said to me, man, he goes, I can't beat that guy. Yeah. He goes, what? Everyone tells me to change. I can't beat him. He goes, I thought about that when I was, when I was training with him. He goes, I can't beat him. Look at his corner, man. He's got his headphones on too. It's like, fuck it. Whatever he's listening to, I'm going to something that's, Carmen came. Slagged does a fantastic, he's a fantastic looking past summit. Here's the specimen of all specimen. He's great. He really is, man. All this junk.

Speaker 4:          01:20:07       We've got a Gal find Cortney Casey all up in this bitch. She's a very good soccer player. NCAA soccer player. Oh real while ago. Soccer translates by the way, what they say, and Cynthia called Vo. She's a motherfucker, a little team, Alpha male beast. She likes to fight to, that girl looks at scrap. This is good.

Speaker 5:          01:25:40       We live on a ball and all that shit. You really don't believe you're not serious and he's kind of a meant to be meant to compliment. I get drunk. I get confused. I just, I just want to cause any, I mean any of it. Some serious conversation and there's some stuff I do agree with Eddie on just certain stuff but can talk. I can talk about the soap. I don't wanna die. So with certain ones with like the flat earth is right there in the middle. Man, I'm a middle anymore than anybody thinks. Oh, Brandon's right fucking there. But what my point was, we don't, when it comes to our beliefs, we're on opposite ends of the fucking spectrum. But you guys said that he fucks with you. But that doesn't mean that I'm not going to compliment you when I, when I see you live, dude, you fucking smash dude. Fucking crush as serious. Believe we live on a ball and all that shit. But I didn't wait until every, I think politically we're pretty far off. I am. I think you're a socialist. Socialist.

Speaker 5:          01:26:43       They got them wrong. Socialist. I thought you are. You out of your fucking give that vibe off. Fuck both of you. Stop. Stop. No one talks. He's fucking with both. Okay. Spill table up bro. Listen to me right now. Look at me right now. I'm an American. I don't. I believe in, in in the constitution. Yes. You believe in gun rights. Okay. I'm, I'm a very, I'm not, I don't believe now that he's free speech. Yeah, Bro. A coffee. El Cortez. You like her? I don't like her. I love you. But was 28 which has not about the, I know I was really into her until she had this clause. No, listen, listen. This is what I meant. Young people that are interested in helping people and changing the world. I don't agree with a lot of her ideology, but she had this one clause that was people who were unwilling to work.

Speaker 5:          01:27:48       She wanted to give money to people who are unwilling to, we want this knife. I mean, how about, how about like passing legislation anymore? Late term abortions. The fuck is going on in New York. There's a reading late late term abortions. I celebrate. We'll have a party. It's dude, it's, yeah, they're partying. They're doing coke. They're doing all that shit for late term abortions. And how bout this? Walls don't work. What the fuck is going on? I let Eddie, you like the wall. Eddie try going to Canada. You can't even get into Canada. If you had a fucking Dui, hold up. Stop, stop, stop. Do you know there's no wall? There's no wall. There's no wall between us and Canada. You could walk right through the woods. People do it all the time with your mom. Not know that cause they know literally hundreds of miles opens woods. We just walk right through. Well, the problem that we have, uh, with against say well don't give, don't head. He's Mexican so he's good and he just, because I'm a capitalist and free market guy and because his father secretary,

Speaker 4:          01:29:02       I'm a Trump guy. I didn't say what I don't want to train. We're all going to be fine. Cynthia got vo. Everyone's on the same team. Yeah. When it comes to the ground, what? America. Now that he's got to hear you more than that. You look here, you're a fucking what? Cheese. You're a problem. Bring the Trump. You're a Goddamn prankster. Yeah. We got two more bottles by the way Brian Callen you're fucking wine choices. Excellent. Actually. Cheese man. Cheese selection, mom. And I know, I know. What's up. The youtube comments will be filled with hate for the smacking. Sometimes she got to say fuck them. You know all comments. How about all the time I never read it. How about stop correcting boys? If you want to make it have a better life, stop commenting on any youtube. I don't know anyone who stopped who goes on Youtube and you think Michael Jordan's up on youtube comment thing.

Speaker 4:          01:29:54       No these guys that, that you know when you can comment and video and the whole world's going to see it, it gives them power. Well you know what it also is, it's like, um, it's like a message board that doesn't get censored. It's a very rare form of message cause the only one that doesn't get censored, right? Cause like Instagram, Twitter, you do shit what people think it gets censored. But what happens is people like say you're spamming and they mark your shit of spam. And if enough people do it, it gets voted down. And it's hard to see. But you can find it ultimately. But the point is basically everyone can post what chewing into Mike who's doing it. That was Maddie. Jesus. My, my thing about a negative comments is that I've had red salmon. I'm of the thing is I'm like, well, I kind of agree with you.

Speaker 4:          01:30:35       Uh, you know, I'm not my own biggest fan, so fuck off. You're not going to say anything that I don't, you know, kind of like, yeah, I'm not a big fan of myself either. Right. I was going to say like, whoa. No. What are you saying about, I'm amazed. I'm amazed I've gotten as far as I've gotten with how little I feel about my work. I think you become, I think I've known you for 25 years and I believe you become not only incredibly thoughtful and you probably have made the biggest transformation of any friend I've ever had, and you've become somebody who listens and podcasts so well. I listen to a podcast all the time. Thank you know, I made a mistake of listening to one of my early ones here the day I was like, oh my God.

Speaker 4:          01:31:17       Listen to one from like eight years ago hits and says, don't go back listening to you now. Listen to how you like, listen, and don't take a position and just are so open about everything that that POC debate. Um, it was just unbelievable. Man. You know what the pot to Beit was important to me because I legitimately think that there are people who should not smoke pot. And this is coming from someone who smokes a lot of pot. You're a reasonable human being. I see it and I'm not a zealot. I see it. I see it in people. I see. There's people that shouldn't fucking do it. And there's people that it does make them lazy there. Everybody's brain reacts differently to caffeine, to nicotine, right. To fucking all the drugs. Yeah. And there's some people that I legitimately feel like have a really hard time with THC weather, especially in edible form.

Speaker 4:          01:32:01       I think edible form is, I think it's legitimately one of the most potent psychedelic drugs that's freely available. I called the poison control center after I had a Brownie. Okay. She's that fucked up. But with the seat. I called him, I called the red band, called the cops on himself. Garden rang up. I woke him up cause already is a seasoned drug addict and back then I had eaten a Brownie and I didn't know what was going on with me and I said, dude, I, I think I'm dying. And he goes, you're not tying contract. I can't feel myself breathing. I can't hear my heart. How old were you at 23030301030 I would understand that. Wouldn't like make a sign and free choice illegal. Like I don't think guns should be illegal and legal is the CBD. My education, I believe in education and I think it's one of the things that I'm trying to do and it's one of the things I was trying to do with that pot debate podcasts is let people know, hey, I've taken some pretty zealot like pull positions in the past where I was like everybody should smoke pot.

Speaker 4:          01:32:59       Don't listen to me from three years ago. Right. Listen to me from right now everybody should not smoke pot. And if you're thinking about smoking pot, smoke a little tiny bit, but that's what this looks like. Alcohol don't finish a whole one shot. Don't be one. I've always said cause I'm influenced a lot of people to smoke pot, but the one thing including me, we said for the for the last 20 years is I've, I've always said this, that I don't think you should start smoking weed until you're at least 28 it's a good, that's a good, that's great. That's great advice. Oh, I never said 2115 I feel that fully developed. Know who you are, become who you are and then smoke weed. That way you can tell the difference between what the pod is doing to you and what you are without the plot.

Speaker 4:          01:33:44       Well not only that, your frontal lobe, your frontal lobe does not fully formed until you're 25 28 is perfect. To that point, they say you shouldn't play football or fight or sparring, if you know what I'm saying. You shouldn't play football. Period. You know there was people fight. Joey Diaz sent me this a link or he told me about rather this, uh, Hbo Real Sports that they did on. That's enough. I don't want some more cheese, more cheese. Real sports on football with his kid was 10 years old. This 10 year old kid had a double concussion, he had a concussion, then another one right afterwards, and he committed suicide at 12 Jesus Christ. Here's my thing with this though, and football, 99% of people aren't like that though. Like that kid probably was going to have problems with, they had that concussion or not down the road, let's say football, just exaggerated.

Speaker 4:          01:34:33       It might be an ally. You know where you see the proof though isn't the, the, the retired NFL players that get into commentating, you would see, you would hear it in their speech, but like Troy Aikman for instance, he's had like a hundred concussions, but he's one of the best commentators out. Tony Roma's had a level guys like junior sal, but hold on Rhonda. Patrick actually detailed this in length is actual scientific evidence about apo for, there's a type of, there's a Genova Jeanette. Yeah, yeah. This is a genetic thing and if you have that, yeah. Did you, do you not have that? Uh, I'm on the good side of it. Good, perfect. Beautiful. You're all right. You know, so you still get damaged, but it's not the same kind of damage. The CTE risk is less CTE is this cheese will knock your dick in the dirt.

Speaker 4:          01:35:20       No, this is a new one. I just opened up. Yeah, that's fucking, that's a daddy smell good. Or I don't fuck around a Cypress g midnight moon. Yeah. What do you coach or how quick it goes? Don't worry about whether a fluff, like what are you wearing when you walk into the door? I always wear a robe and I go into a dark cave. All right.

Pleat the fuck out of that. It's amazing. We had an 80 day, 180 days more than he gets rotten is, fuck huh? That's weird. It's not because it's all like 35% right?

Speaker 4:          01:36:06       Dry Age beef, disgusting or no, he brought it. He brought out the photos of the meat. It looked delicious. Yeah. I mean it was red. Just you don't like it and he doesn't like onions. Did this. No let needs in the city. There's no onions and cheese. It's garbage. Right? It's delicious, man. I didn't do any. It's nutty and sweet. What's the problem? Well, you know how this jeans for brain damage, there's also genes for flat earth belief and bad cheese tastes really bad. He's in flat earth got go. Oh, just delicious. How could you not like this? That's a good fucking try it again. I think you got it. I'm not bringing you to APL because I'm all over that. I want to take you on vine in Hollywood.

So I saw him and I was at American top team and I was like, and I said to Jimmy Burke, Jimmy Burke was one the, I go, Jimmy, Jimmy, I go with that guy. I think I bad mouth him or I was at least didn't, I was kind of like, yeah I called you so trying to go, I gotta take a shower but I just got to sneak over it. Cause when I went in there a bunch of guys were like, Hey, cause they all want listened to the podcast. I was like a celebrity and I thought he was there and I was just, I legitimately was to love no, but I just, yeah, I would just to slow down and choked them out there as I'm dying. Bread is gonna get you for this. He is impossibly large. Well it played for the Dallas cowboys.

Speaker 5:          01:40:12       Well novel athlete, phenomenal athletes just hits women. So I can't fuck with it. That's kind of my thing. Legit allegedly, well no, he did get convicted of it, but maybe he's re kind of, you know, let's be found. You hold on a second. Oj Simpson got acquitted so let's settle the fuck down on convicted. Well, but he got it. He, but he did charge guilty in civil court. Civil. Yeah. We all glove does not fit. You must've, let's be the bad. I know nothing. I know. I'm not saying that's the reason why looking at it that way, he might be a great guy. Me and might get along. It might start puking. He seemed like he was very well liked because the guys around him were just all, I mean I put out a tech, should

Speaker 4:          01:40:54       I have oh and my podcast, Yay or Nah. I said, hell yeah, you should. Why wouldn't you? He's not going to open up. It's not going to open up. It would be one interview where he was like, no, this is what I did. Remember that book you wrote a book. If I did it, if I could talk to him and he just needed one. Life is like now that talked about one of those interviews. Can we do like if I did it? Part two is yeah. Yeah. These are all lies. These are all lies. Just want to let the audience know this is not real and just let them go off. Come on man. Fuck silly getting there, dude. 52 but hit. Um, did you guys ever see when Oj did a music video after he got acquitted, he was doing like rap. That's why we're friends, dude. Have you seen it? It's amazing. It's amazing. Yeah. He's hanging out with all his heart. He was like dancing and yeah. Jamie, pull up the Oj Simpson music video.

Speaker 4:          01:41:51       It's going to make sure you guys get juice and he's fucking, when we play it, are we going to get with his girlfriend in the video? How crazy is it that he beats that rap and then it gets thrown in jail for some stupid shit. The stupidest of stick with kidnapping. We can't listen to it, but look at watch the cat, but he's got a crown on. Just think about it. He cut his fucking ex wife's head off. You went to Miami, got weird kitchen knife and look at him in there dancing and this is right when he gets out of, they all got titties out. Get juiced. It's uncensored. Look at this. A porn channel, uncensored video. Look at Oj Simpson and wearing a wig dressed up like Elvis after he murdering people. This is our two years after he got to quit it.

Speaker 4:          01:42:31       Just think about that. He murdered two people less than 10 years before he made this video and he's dancing around with these hoes. That is bizarre. Some hosts, when he got to Miami, they said he fucked all the girls lined up to fuck Oj Simpson three got acquitted after how creek while dark Ted Bundy. They want to fuck murderers, Bang and bitch. And you think that, let's, let's talk about that. What do you think that is? I have an idea. Not all the girls. It's a, it's a small percentage of girls. What does that, what does that, I think that it's probably primordial. I think it goes back to the Alpha male who kills and rules with ruthlessly and I think that there seems to be there, there's probably a feeling of safety if you can align with that with the biggest, baddest male. But yeah, but he's, he's killing women with that power lifters with half that.

Speaker 4:          01:43:24       So I think that is also the idea that if I can tame him, that there's a challenge to that there. There's a, I knew certain fuck that, you know. Right. Have been with many women who are drawn to bad ass. I don't know. That's exactly what I was going to, because I have, I had to jump to the gun. I know my wife is I think said like dot.

I really enjoyed doing commentary with him. Damn Danny Castillo. Should we vape?

By the time those kids get older or their sales circuses in fucking weird places like, you know, weird fucking middle of the country, John and stuff. No, I'm talking about America or England. We were, it's during lunch.

Speaker 4:          01:55:31       It's done because you can't have elephants anymore. I'm out. Yeah. You want to talk about tough people like Izer by Shawn? We don't, there are a lot of fighters there that are waiting to get visas. Just like with dog Estann there's all for MMA and wrestling and Azerbaijan is their national. There's that one. My buddies there and now he's working there and he said his son is in a wrestling club. There's a wrestling club everywhere and he said they the all the kids from literally from eight to 16 years old, they're all wrestling guy comes out with mouthpieces and boxing gloves, no headgear and all the kids like, yeah, they start cheering, put on their gloves, putting the mouthpieces and start banging. Well the need nuclear physicist so they can compete with us in the global world. War is the next country to little thing is that shit. That's great. If you want cage fighters. Yeah. You know, Oppenheimer flip the switch on all that shit. He's just very cute. You can't do a Mongol style anymore. You know, this is a bunch of old masculine, the powers. Oh Man. Oh Shit.

Speaker 4:          01:56:32       Taylor boss. Fuck it's guy. He did a great job, man. He painted for me and I looked at it and the first time when I saw it in the flash I was like, that needs to be in the fucking studio. Kids good looking over us. He does a great look at her eyes. That's a good artist right there. Yeah, no, Tim is amazing. Hunted Hendricks out in the hallway too. He's painted and that's really hard to have a Hendrix problem. How many fucking Hendra Patriots, Huh? The reason why this show's called the Joe Rogan experience is Hendrix. Jimi Hendrix experience. I probably listen to Hendrix more than I'm listening to any human being on the planet earth. You love him. Love. I'm feeling about it. It's about the size of that to me is my number one who dumb he's saying from me. But I think I've listened to Hendrix more. You know, it's just like he was so pure who was so free with, what did he die from? 20 zero seven drug. This one dies, knows what am drugs. There was a story. Stories truck. Yeah. The official stories do me, what is Joe turns into conspiracy.

Speaker 4:          01:57:30       His manager, his manager was a gangster in it. There was a guy who was one of the henchmen for his manager. They said the manager killed him cause Hendricks was leaving up. The one thing that supports that is that it was weird that he died like choking on his own vomit and he didn't have heroin in his system or like there's like some weirdness to it, but then the other part of it is that the girlfriend, Hendricks girlfriend was allegedly committed suicide by jumping off a roof. But the henchman says they threw her off a row. Yeah, white chick, which she, she knew that without. The other thing that's disappointing about Hendrix, if you hear that Hendrix used to beat his girlfriend, but that might've been, she was smear campaign prior to, we talked about how he hit his wife. She did a lot of coke and fucked everyone. Richard Presto hit hitters. There's also rumors he suck Dick. Not Rumors. No, his wife, his ex wife confirmed it like he fucked Marilyn. Marlon Brando. Richard Pryor. Yeah. I don't believe it. Not shut the fuck up. You don't believe. Have you seen it been the day man, back in the day, parents white came out with a whole thing in the 60s she was smearing. No, no, no, no, no, no. It was okay back then everybody. But the story, the Bachelor,

Speaker 5:          01:58:42       I've never done coke, but when you do coke and you were in the sixties and seventies apparently those guys are just fucking whatever was in Jackson. I'm David Bowie did that shit. Well she was saying Pryor's wife was saying, her exact quote I think was you'll fuck a radiator if you get enough coke in front of you. You guys, you guys are trying to deal with you guys. You guys want to do some code? Know what? Maybe a no, no, no. Marlin broke. Maybe David Bowie, maybe Mick Jagger, maybe David Bowie. Did they get their stomach pumped or something like that? Rod Stewart. But that's all I, that's all your Dear Journal myth to Keith Urban. The Telegraph for this might be real, but we know we didn't think about Richard Gere, Juno. It was thinking about the Richard Girls. He's gay. Straight. No, no, no, no. But here's the thing. The Richard Gere durable thing apparently came right after he left Scientology.

Speaker 5:          01:59:28       That's the real, Oh yes. Okay. That's a smear underwear, but it's such a good smear campaign. When I like lemon, when I first met Eddie, Eddie and I talked about this because he grew up in La. I grew up in Boston. We both heard the Richard Gere story at the same time that exactly, because motherfuckers spread across the country who was a healer as a huge, they were getting, no, he just had a baby and he's 85,000 years old still doing it. By the way. I ain't got Jamie Brett Young, Richard Gere looking at a sexy, a little with his shirt off. Hey, how about officer and a gentlemen going nowhere else. I'm all that movie, Dude. I love that movie and I love that scene. Oh, it was amazing. How good as Louis Gossett Jr. Oh Damn. He was good. He won an Oscar for that or was it nominated? He was incredible to watch. That movie didn't win the world. Fucking terrible back. Do you ever watch them an unfaithful and you watch it with your share? Like cheating on her show outward?

Speaker 7:          02:00:23       Huh?

Speaker 5:          02:00:26       What are your truck? Rough? No, that's the old movies. That's like his tenure three movie get. I'm looking at him. Look at him, dude. Fuck Dude. He was, he was the shit when he was younger, man. Yeah, but he didn't have any kids until his low to be fucking like 380 [inaudible] New York strip right there. Beautiful. He steals your girl all day long. That's an I beat that guy to death in front of his mom. Doesn't matter. It doesn't matter. He's vulnerable. He cries and you're doing a young Clint Eastwood beats that lesson. I was a handsome boy when I was young. You were cute too, but gear picture, you and I in the nineties I know. Going to fucking know you had some swag. He dressed like shit. Yeah, no, I was just ridiculous. No, your show. It was cool that he kept the sweaters in. We were both in disaster. My sweaters while we may as well. He's a, here we go. James Vick, Duke. Can we watch? We do that. We're going to watch this. It's a good fight. We're gonna Watch this would definitely have watched the main event fell. There's such a competitor, man. Little, they're all competitors, right? Yeah. Well they're competing for living Brian. Jesus calls, but he's just telling me, look how big Vic is so long, but you got to think he cuts the shit out of weight. He is a giant. How much does he cut? He's like struve.

Speaker 4:          02:01:40       Is that Stefan struve is this, this is 55 right dude. Great references. D five yes it is this 55 Oh fucking one six three six six three 55 that's a big advantage. Cuts so much weight when he gets hit. It's true. Hey, fuck, Felder and I were in the fucking locker room last time we were working together and we're getting changed, getting ready for UFC. I go, dude, what the fuck do you weigh? And he goes, whoa. One night I go, bitch, you 200 pounds and we're laughing about, always lie about their weight and he goes, what about you? And I go pitch him on TRT. I'm 50 years old. Not all the juice I need to get on that stuff. You should. I've been telling you for about eight years, Brian went, his mind has so much energy. You look good. You look good. My Cock, I just injected in your little skinny neck. Dawn could cut a dye, should shoot it right into the tip of your heart. I don't have a cat would blunt its claws on my friend.

Speaker 4:          02:02:41       Come on. Ooh. Fell to just connected with it. I'm still fighting that hard issue to knee lost. Still fighting though. I think he's still fine. I don't think he's officially retired and on the top last funny, he might've retired. I don't know why he doesn't use his jab more struve. Yeah. Oh good. He's seven foot tall and the nicest guy in the planet. Hard for the size of an elephant. It's a problem. When I interviewed him, I feel so awkward. I'm like, well dad, what zoo? Or we go into or whatever, dude, I wouldn't got coffee with him. Like get your dick out of my face. And he's just so tired. That's me. Do you remember when we meet? I met him. We were all hanging out cause you guys had the same manager and we were hanging out and he's sitting down, he's as tall as I am standing and I, and I said to Brendan and I go, I go, dude, what would you do if you had to fight him?

Speaker 4:          02:03:33       And Brandon was still fighting. Can you know him and brought him down to that to him because Brendan Goes, Oh, I'd knock him the fuck out. That's what I took it. You took it personally, Cyrus, we were supposed to fight like twice. You were looking at this fight right here. Let's watch this fight. Yeah. Let's watch two fights tonight. Paul Felder, Double Jab, Double Jab. What did you, do you ever think about doing actual commentary because I know you played me in a movie, but you're willing to do actual commentary, Bafta, Bafta, Joe Rogan, warrior. I had an offer and I said, I don't know enough about to do to fight. I think. I think everyone should pick you up or rice and beans. Epstein and Dennis Miller do commentary. Hold on. That was the issue. When I started working for the UFC, I was concerned. I was legitimately concerned because this was before UFC 37 and a half when I started working for the UFC.

Speaker 4:          02:04:30       Dennis Miller was doing Monday night football and I was like, I don't want to fuck this up. So I decided like I made a conscious effort. I'm not even going to remotely try to be funny. No, I'm, I'm like, I'm funny actually you shouldn't have to write. It meant a lot to me. Like martial arts means a lot martial artist and seller didn't ever play football. He couldn't relate to any of you. Please put in Jackson, junior, all American. Does it change when George Washington was coming across to Delaware? We have a black, he was hard. He was horrible. I feel bad for him because he wasn't set up for success in that. That's not a good place. Well he was trying to throw those jokes around like he had written out like he was getting to like spite. I think they probably brought him in to do that though.

Speaker 4:          02:05:10       But then thinking about it for his jokes, they have to, okay. All of his shit. So prewrite that was a nightmare. He really thinks so hundred percent they didn't give him the free reign. Crazy seeing about the UFC as that. They don't tell me what to do. You've never said anything outrage on here. You've said some shit, really ridiculous things, but you're also the best at what you do. So, but the fact that they have this billion dollar multibillion dollar organization and let me talk is fucking insane. Never. I never fought MMA. You're on black book, Joe Buck number play baseball and he's one of the best color. Yeah. It was a play by play of color. Different play by play. Guy Doesn't have to, he doesn't have to be a professional. Don't put it be generally has to be. What I'm saying is Joe, so goddamn good. Some of them they said, fuck it.

Speaker 4:          02:06:00       We don't care about that shit. Well, the thing is, I wasn't good when I first just have been doing some day one. Day One, it's over. We tagged them. Fell there is, he's clinching is a beast. Well, vix trying to hold out. He's so nasty. He says, I feel sick for so much cheese. Cheese. I had my cholesterol just shot up to 3000 I don't think it works like that. Nope. No it doesn't. No, it doesn't have any effect on the skin. Is that tree? Yeah. Dietary cholesterol is almost zero effect on blood lipids. Mostly it's genetic. There's a lot of different, various issues, but people that have certain genes really shouldn't fuck with a lot of high cholesterol foods. But for the most part, dietary cholesterol has been scientifically proven, have almost zero effect on blood, high cholesterol. So I have to, well, some people do well, the thing is about what is it, LDL or HDL and w w if they're balanced out together, the real thing is like checking for um, artery.

Speaker 4:          02:07:00       I can slack like Che checking to see if you're okay. Can you do that with a sonic? No. You need to go to a real doctor, mother fucker. No, no, no, no. I'm saying, can you do that when I do it? I can't do it for you. Can you check my arterial branch? I can check your aura. Check my was that same. He saw a doctor, but he was such a for your psoriasis. I can't tell you how to finger in your butt. Uh, about two, three fingers, deep fingers or size of bratwurst. And should I do that? Did he grow over, done that colonoscopy when he gets all three of [inaudible] 15. When you're 50 you got to get a colonoscopy. A doctor gets all three and he goes, you gotta go get a colonoscopy. Did you get a call on that? Yeah, me too. Yeah, I was getting my butthole looks amazing to put you out.

Speaker 4:          02:07:46       I'm still happy. Request a female. Like I say, I gotta say that I'm so happy that the UFC is on ESPN. I really, I think it's so good for the sport. It's so much better than Fox. Cause so many. Yeah. It's so good because so many people that are just sports fans just watch the ESPN all day long to bars have ESPN on all the time. Just on a loop. On a loop. I'd leave ESPN then. Yeah, if I'm just at home, that's my default. He used to be that. Yeah. And I don't give a fuck about sports, but I understand it. I know it. It's such a big move for the UFC. It's huge. I think it's so tone for that perfect home. I agree. I'm so happy when, when I, when I heard it was happening and then the streaming service because you know, because I spent so much time, oh look at this James Vick, I spent so much time doing online stuff.

Speaker 4:          02:08:30       I was really happy about that. I was like, good streaming is where the future lies. What is filters? Rank? He's not right. He's a, you know, it's probably a top 25 that they don't really rank you until your top 15 though. He's aiming at the top 15 I feel like, well that was why he didn't get that Khabib fight and al I acquainted did, but in retrospect that was actually really huge because al fought a great fight, went five full rounds with could be, which Connor couldn't do and then beat Kevin Lee's ass and his next fight and I was ranked number four in the world and should be and should be. Ally acquainted when he's focused is a fucking gangster. He's the one restaurant, right? He, I don't know what his name is. D One wrestled at Juco is not going to Dustin and, and shadow.

Speaker 4:          02:09:12       Somebody asked him and Mike Brown, I think Jimmy said, what's the one discipline that you think is the best thing to have in wrestling? Have them, I don't know. Wow. I know wrestling, that's why you shouldn't do commentary except in the movie stripes. Being smart around gets a conversation going. Wrestling's everything man. It's the ability to dictate them to fight. That takes place. I wrestled in high school did, that's why I do the champions. All the champions hit me that night.

So I showed her a triangle and she, cause I wanted, I want her her to do it on her next boyfriend and then have him ask her, where the Hell you learned that from? I got pissed on her. You know what I mean? Chess. So she was obsessed with you triangle. He's marked her. She's obsessed with triangles. So I'm trying to watch Howard Stern, right? And she's trying to put me in a triangle and I keep telling him to stop.

Ah, they did enough crazy girl when she, when I, when I held onto her afterwards and she admitted it to me like he was like, it was just a real ad. It tells me when it was really, Oh God, Oh shit. Vic was landed some shots thereby felt, oh, I cannot wait for us. Made a fag, man. Hey Boys, we're talking about domestic violent moment. Dude, we should enjoy this fun live in the moment than I have been beaten by. That's a weird thing, man. When someone expresses some shit that they saw from their mom and their dad, I had a real, I really lucky that my step mom and my dad, my Stepdad, and my mom rather had a really good relationship and my mom and my dad had a bad relationship, so he saw.

Speaker 4:          02:17:24       There's less white trash up there. The families get the other people that are going to hate me for it. They hate when I bring it up cause I get so fucking sacred. Like, well they don't want it to be like Nas Kanye restaurant. How share, how's it a secret of Kanye West has a ski town or what? No. When is he going to be on your podcast? What's happening? Oh Man. What's hard. Is that happening? No, it'll probably happen. It's just Kanye is, you know, he's a complicated artist and I'm sure there's a bunch of other issues. First of all, he wants to get to know me. We got to get to hang out together and go, oh James Felder with time that shit, we'll do it.

Speaker 4:          02:18:03       We'll do it to bring him. He's a really nice guy, man. When I talked to him on the phone, he's a very, very nice guy. You already talked to him? Yeah, I talked to him on the phone, so nice guy. We'll do it, but I'm not in a rush, you know? Hey, I told you guys I really liked doing these. As much as I like doing anything. Like when someone says like, what's a, what's your favorite guest or a zero one guests. You've never had aunt. It doesn't exist. They don't exist. There's no one I like. I like doing podcasts. I like doing podcasts with everyone watching flights to than a future that, that guy who's working on longevity drugs. That was fascinating. Yeah. John Sinclair. Where do I get resurveyed or all? I need some of that resveratrol. You can buy it online. Really shouldn't learn how to spell it first.

Speaker 4:          02:18:49       Oh Shit. You drink it all day. It's in wine or really low doses. You really want to know more fan industrial grade. Oh Shit. Felder's spinning like a motherfucker. Ooh, leg kicked by Vic. Oh, Vik with the jumping knee. That's it. That's a wrap. Okay. 55 okay, that's fair. I know he's Vic soaps, so he got being cater. Francis Kane of course Eddie. Um, he's a great fight. I should be going for king because he's Mexican. Take that out of it. When it comes off, the best vaccine is titled go a fuck about Mexicans when we inbox only in boxes. But I'm going with Kane. I'm going to ask you, just scared me when throw any punches against Derek Lewis. That's scared. But his last fight though, he fucking starch Curtis blades. Yeah, he did. Here's my house. Here's my, I don't know, like I use up wrestler, who's a fucking row, a national champion.

Speaker 4:          02:19:51       Juco risk snatch him. So he's back and that's the second fight they've had. Okay. So he's bet was he throwing a large amount of punches and it was the first like 30 seconds talk man, here's, here's my take on it. Francis is a fucking specimen and his story literally is like right at a corner and the barbarian or the heat or lower heart. No, he worked in a fucking sand mill, digging sand, making sandbags all day. That's how he, his body got strong. I mean, he lived in this incredibly poor country in Africa. He called my room. Yeah. He went and moved to France. It was homeless. He learned how to fight and they wanted to be a boxer and they said, you should do MMA. Four years later, the guy is like at the pinnacle of MMA, fighting in the UFC against worldclass competition and fucking people up.

Speaker 4:          02:20:45       Do you understand that? When he knocked out Alistair Overeem with that vicious like shovel, that'd be the hardest upper cut I've ever seen. It's, it's insane that he beat a guy who's not just a worldclass fighter, but a k one grand Prix champion. A Guy, 20 years. Find any Mexicans. He's older though. I don't know. That's an older Allister star. We got heart. Well, it's an Alice to weigh out the secret sauce. He didn't get that when Jamie goes, you never seen Jay relief. That all fell to one is fine. Felder one, this one is fight Vic Vic shaking his head. Felder, Paul Felder. I'm gonna text him right now cause I'm friends with them to turn it up. No, no, no. That's okay. He gave it his all. He's in Moses to get all fancy texts like certain people. Yes. Still in the sky. This rapper that I'm a huge fan of shaving.

Speaker 4:          02:21:34       Well shake. Well, oh man. Conspiracy Rapper. No Dude, he's just, there's a, there's a video called leg lock on Youtube shake. Well it's, it's like a Tim and Eric. Awesome show. Great job type video. It's fucking brilliant. Watch that shit. And now we're texting now and I'm like, we're going to make a song together. It's, I'm like, I'll Gideon fast. And a lot of music unity. It's the same like I've always done. I've never stopped. I never stopped. I've always made music always. It's always been doing the podcast for a second. Stop doing podcasts. Right. Period. You're not doing that anymore. You just started repeating myself all the time. I'm like, you know what, that's so annoying to deal with the things off triply tinfoil hat podcast. No. When did you see same? So I'll Tripoli I haven't heard from days ago. Really good. Yeah, I see him at the store. I see my right. You know what? On this podcast,

He's literally one of the reasons why started to cheat. Every time we go on the road some, you know, sometimes I have shitty ass nights. I thank God that Sam triply goes after me and saves the guy we went to. I spent two weeks in Afghanistan with that guy. That guy would get up and he would open for us because he was the only one who could soldiers just sitting there. We'd be in the middle of nowhere. He would get up with a shitty mic and destroyed. Now he's got 10 years under his belt. Scheller he said, I called him. I've been doing standup. What's Tripoli for 20 plus years and you know what? I'm straight up love tripling his fuckers.

Speaker 3:          02:23:10       Look at him. Sam Tripoli's podcast, tinfoil. That's a Comcast. That's where I go off. Don't hold. Don't hold John hostage like subdued myself here. Conspiracy theories, but if you want to hear, we go off, go to tin foil hat podcast. That's what he goes. A good chance. I wreck that new raptor after out tonight. I love that. Raptor was nothing. Brendan, I love that you bought that Elon Musk took a bigger hit than that you have MOUs losses. This is legal, right? He didn't lose his job. Come on, dammit. That had to be one of the most iconic moments in the history of the Internet. First of all, it's the small one in podcasts and it was a a completely on the fly moment. Is that your biggest podcast? No. Biggest one. What's the biggest one? Ship. You don't know who's number one? Number one down most views.

Speaker 3:          02:24:05       I only go by what you see on the, first of all, that'd be the biggest one in podcast history. It also made me like Elon Musk. He's a good decision. Before I've saw him around his kids go to a gym. I just go to, I didn't dislike it, but that may. I'm like, oh, he's cool. I had to buy his car because I told them I would buy his car when I did the part. I don't like him anymore. That's right. I'm so happy. I wish you did it. No, no, no. I have eight other cars. It's just see if my rap, you can run over your time. I love your raptor. But um, listen man, I'm telling you that God damn Tesla is the future. I think other cars are stupid.

We got people listening at home when they got their headphones on and then we at Dick head in the back, it hurts their ears. Okay. Yeah. You know, he is such a bad ass, but his body is not just the double decker tacos. He doesn't have, when you look at his body, you'd be like, that just doesn't look like, okay, but I'm gonna save all that look shit because he's got the best body ever for the MMAS heavyweight division. When he was in his prime, well that body body, he knocked out, make it tomorrow. He took giant bombs from Czech Congo and I see what you're saying, but not that that was the same body mass that's not flapping around like a ball cap the biceps or lose number one heavyweight for me, Jon Jones. Hey guys, let's not talk over each other. This has gotta be ruthless in his prime when he was at his best, like when he knocked out man Notaro you know when he beat up rather as an error look at fate or his body. Yeah, exactly. It's true. It's the body that the way it looks, I was talking about flat earth. It means nothing. It doesn't matter. Well guess what fucks we'll find out tonight. Cause Francis has the best bodies body and k looks like a a, they were talking about like the, the female UFC bodies.

Speaker 5:          02:30:46       Louise, do you guys never do? I always do. Never here. My favorite is volunteers. It's always about with, I think she's so hot. Cody. Garbrandt it's always the same shit. No, you take the stage. Oh no sort of itch. I'm going to show us. She's better looking than the ring cargo van Zandt dime piece Rose Nama Juniors. Oh, switch has preposterous genetics. Oh rose. Nama Jealous. They're just

Speaker 3:          02:31:20       to me so much money stripping in wigs like long wigs. She come, makes a ring walk and she's got this long as it takes it off. And that becomes your thing I think. I think for me, I don't know what it is so hot. You know, rose is one of the most beautiful women in the history of the sport and she's the one who emphasizes it. Almost the least. Who naturally beautiful magazines, Beautiful Bald, Bald Rose Rama, Julia. She's stunning looking. She's stunning. Looking amazing. She's cool. She's a great fighter. She's also like super fucking like Keith Carradine. She's into her own life, her own way, you know. Definitely hasn't gotten Hollywood with the Nah, man. She's like, she's like when? When she wins the fight and knocks out nominee Eunice, y'all, you know, y'all just be nice to each other. It's like, why? She's great movie right there at that fight with Joanna. John, John to bitch.

Speaker 3:          02:32:21       Tell her name right now and I can say it. Spell it again. Genji yeah, but we can say it. You had to write it down. It wouldn't be right. What does it, Jay can't spell. What do you think? What percentage don't fans of hers? It's a hard name. Brian. Stan just started calling her. You want a champion? He just gave up. That's just lazy. Bryan Wright at house, while he's respectful, he's a Goddamn all American who's more all American than Brian's kind of hard enough thought. He can't be crazy names. As an American, it's tough. No level of hard. It's that. It's that that tie level, you know, cause some of them tie names. Song Tong, jeopardy champion level. Yeah. That's a hard one. Those show me be, I'm right there with the brushes and money. Me and Wolf Blitzer was on jeopardy. I'd lose five pounds, something like that.

Speaker 3:          02:33:19       Can anybody here spell, does the beats last name? He's the one I might be able to get online. Why would we want to spell that? Normal. No one spells really anymore. What I'm saying Jamie could do it. Those whose names are hard to remember because to this day right now I still don't know is the beats lashkars hormone monster Sherif part. But here's the thing about these nerves and worked for the FC Bro. But did you have to be practiced it over and over again? Because I had a really hard time with it to the point where his coaches were saying just calm rooms that beat and that felt that was disrespectful. But yeah, but it felt like this, this is the gentleman's name, he's excellent. I don't see the difference.

Speaker 3:          02:34:08       I never thought like, cause Dave's last name I just gave up on it. And said, there's no way I could do this. You know, we have to respect the phallic say this, but we have to respect the fact that they have a totally different language in terms of like their letters, letters, they can respect the fact that they have complete different language. Makes a fucking tough. It's very hard. It's difficult to, I don't know what the fuck's going to happen right here. I do not know what the phone can we hear them discount, get his head in his chest. He kicked off of Youtube or some shit. We just need to watch this on her own. Um, I'm, in my opinion, this is what it is. The greatest as it in terms of best I've ever seen performances. He's the most, one of the most stunning athletes I've ever seen.

Speaker 3:          02:34:49       Cain Velasquez like one of the most amazing heavyweights of all time, if not the best of all time. He, he, he might be the best. And then Francis at all the guys I've ever seen fight is the scariest of all time. He has the most of all in. Sure. Yup. Yup, Yup. Most potential. He, he's only been fighting a small amount of time and he's already in like world class competition. You have to understand to knock out a guy like Alistair Overeem literally like five years in a training that's insane. He something uniquely special in terms of his like, like the, the what, the shit that he had to endure working in a fucking sand mine digging bags of sand, the kind of power that he possesses. If he just gets all those other pieces in place. He like, in terms of like an overall physical specimen, he's one of the scariest of all time.

Speaker 3:          02:35:36       So this is, this is an amazing fight. I mean this is like as good as it gets if you're an MMA fan. Holy Shit. This is literally as good as it gets. It just, just depends on what version of gain we get. It's not uncommon in this sport for uh, you know, fast rising stars that are a rising because of their beastliness and their knock out power. It's not uncommon for them to not train Jujitsu. Right. We've seen plenty of them. You know what I mean? How crazy would it be if Zingano actually trained Jujitsu, right. And fell. No, we got time for that. You know what I mean? We don't know what he does. Right. We don't know if he does not over there. Well, I know when he got in for Steve Bay, they show you just hit [inaudible] center. But how loud, if he say he just, he just went to Danaher's just fell in love with John Danner.

Speaker 3:          02:36:27       They just became best friends. That would be the jumped in I imagine how good he is. 36 so that would be, you know what I mean? Up with Jujitsu. He's how old is, you could only survive, knock out power for solar. You know what I mean? After a while you're going to be getting clips easily. Tail Hook guys were killing this show by talking over each other like this. Yeah, you're, you're 100% right. You know what I'm saying is eventually no matter, no. We see over and over again. No matter how Beasley you are and how powerful you are with those punches, eventually you're going to get clipped. Right. You're going to go down. So eventually you might have to switch your strategy to instead of going out there and just trying to knock a dude out to going out there and try to take it to the town and submit this month where we go, well, and he's so powerful. If he had good wrestling skills, holy shit, you're gonna find out right is the thing is like with wrestlers, don't you think that you have to learn it at a really young age? Well, George Saint Pierre didn't, right? Oh shoot, ain't got clip on the left hand right there. Good Damn. Damn. Look how giant he loves. So shit dude, he's so big. He's so big and so dangerous.

Speaker 3:          02:37:41       Oh my goodness. Oh my goodness. Come on man. He's incredible. Did he blew his ACL, MCL, LCL. Something's wrong with his leg or maybe not dude. And Cain is one of the best of all time. That's how good in Ghana was. Damn. He got through that block. Fuck. He got through it and a big guy I've ever seen, and it wouldn't have been a surprise if in Ghana was super cautious. Maybe two rounds of being super cautious. We wouldn't be that surprised, aimless, the aggressor. Chill out, Bro. But the fact that he fucking threw down like this, boom, he went, oh, you almost like forearm. He got forearmed in the first. The first to admit, no, let's see. This again. Never got hit anywhere. Oh Jesus. Oh Shit. We saw the fight differently. Oh Wow.

Speaker 3:          02:38:54       Everybody missed it. We all missed this Friday. Then for Caina, let's be real damn back injury, and I said this, that the Lcl, MCL blog gets MCL. Right? Then when it's bent this way, when it comes to this, that's all of them. That's MCO. How old is he now? I don't know, but he's a weathered, whatever it is. There's 37 37 now. I wouldn't even fight. You could only take so many wars. Each war is significant in your life. Like each one took some of your life and eventually that's it. You can't, you already, you went to five crazy wars. That's not that. That's what Tom or that ended that way. Well, you know what it is, man. I think guys that are that championship caliber like cane, their mind is so ferocious that their body is almost like a space ship reentering. It's missing tiles and it starts fuck a chicken apart.

Speaker 3:          02:39:53       There's so powerful in terms of their ability to keep driving, keep driving, and then the knees go in, the neck goes tobaccos and then you deal with these physical realities of the body that you're giving. Still there. [inaudible] still there, but I know that when I was saying in the middle of that, I'm in the middle of trying to come back. Yeah. You know what I mean? Right now since my shoulder, it's been six months in my, since my shoulder surgery had my bicep reattached to my shoulder, had knee surgery about 10 months ago. That's still not 100% like it's still, they're not red. They're still rolling with, I'm rolling with 130 pound blue belts and shit, but he read my shit the last three weeks I've been rolling with some little blue belts that I gotta be able to have like 50 pounds on them and have total control.

Speaker 3:          02:40:41       You know at this point, you know what I mean? I'm little for Francis and blown ACL for Kate. Well, I mean it definitely is a blown knee for cane, but Francis, when's your fight? Because like when Francis was coming after him and he clipped him, he definitely clipped him with that forearm behind the neck. 80 or hundred percent. That's a nightmare. That's a nightmare outcome. 100% cause Francis just clipped and knocked down. Do you want to hear about, they say, yeah. What do they have to say? Yeah, give me some volume. I look at the teeth on them.

Speaker 6:          02:41:13       I don't hear anything.

Speaker 3:          02:41:15       Good job, Jamie. There it goes.

Speaker 6:          02:41:21       Okay.

Speaker 3:          02:41:45       I mean he believes date now.

Speaker 3:          02:41:51       He did, but I liked it the way he was moving in on them, man. I mean he really did look on that Land Rover at that forum. Did that forum later in the back of his neck. You know what man, I'm going to rethink what I said. I'm going to rethink it. I know. I thought I saw his forearm clip. His neck. He blows it. Wait, no, no, no, no trouble. What do you think you did hit him with that? No, he kind of felt though before that he'll Jaynie goes, that's what it is. That's what it is. And he gets out just a shit. The thing is, he's so heavy handed. I think you might be correct, but I do think that he connected with his neck or the guys this heavy handed that? Nope. Nope. Nothing here. Nothing. Nothing there though. Nothing Nigos out. Oh, because you're right. You're right. You're right. I was wrong. I thought it was, I thought it hit his neck. It did not hit his neck. It hit his back. Right shoulder. No. Yeah, here we go. It was clear. There is that. Here we go. Yeah. Holy Shit Dude. He was throwing him around. He's a freak for it to saint gotta.

Speaker 6:          02:43:06       Yeah,

Speaker 5:          02:43:10       that's a lineman right there. A middle linebacker, right? Well, he's not done. See the thing about this guys, he hasn't been fighting for very long though. Even though he loses to steep. Bain has that. The timid performance against Lewis. He says, so little mileage. What does it say about his name? Hold on.

Speaker 6:          02:43:32       Is that that's how it happened. I know it wasn't the result you're looking for. It will take some time, but how soon might we see you back in and you know they're more calm and relaxed, so breaking everyone was going to happen

Speaker 5:          02:43:53       or it's the worst. Very classy. Yeah. Came very classy. You know, never bitter. How weird is it? The Fox and this one, he's not even talking about his knee thing. He's going to retire things. You're more tired.

Speaker 6:          02:44:11       No need to apologize. I know I speak for UFC fans around the world.

Speaker 5:          02:44:15       That's Cy way, by the way. How good is, how good is Jon Anik? He's a bass. That's the best. It's such a bummer to lose. Wonderful that Jon. Anik is so good. I love John. I'm so impressed with him. Like when I work with him, he's, he's, he's so like, he's such a good commentator. He had the first thing, I'm going to make sure it ESPN, MMA, like can I, let me, let, let, let's look at this was the shoulders was the, was maybe an upper cut. Might've landed right there. Ooh, my right there. Right there. I'm going to lay in that upper cut. Might've sat them down the Opera Cup. Mighty God. Here we go. It's hard to tell right way to go again. Here we go. So nothing, nothing so far, nothing. Watch this right here. Right here. Right here. Oh, oh, upper cut yourself. Can I redeem myself?

Speaker 5:          02:45:12       Okay, let's see. You are correct. You're right. Different anger missed it. That was a legit, when I was getting too close, I was just, cause he, I forgot he blew his knee out for sure because the upper cut down that sat him down. He knows this is what's important. This is what's important. And Matt, Matt Tie, he has a fantastic article out right now about one of the problems with society today is that people look at the news like they look at sports. Like someone asks me write about things. You have to know everything. But it's a great article. Matt Taibbi, this is a perfect example of four guys who are lifelong martial artists and we both went both ways. I was like, you're right. And then we saw it again. Like, you're right, you're right. That's how you're supposed to look at Shit. Yeah. That's how you're supposed look at once. It

Speaker 3:          02:46:12       can't be attached to certain fight. Certain fights, it gets stopped early. Okay. Tj Answer Huda. I thought it was stopped early. Don't, I've talked to people that say they didn't think it was stopped early and I'm like, all right, Oh hey, I'll listen to me. He clipped him. Right. But I felt like when I watched it that you got to give a guy a chance to fight more. But especially on the, I'll hear you out in the NFL when they review plays they review them and one of the most important things about reviewing a play is that you have multiple angles. Yeah, it's all good. The all, all three angles, they keep going back to the first angle we didn't get, we didn't get a good enough angle because that right hand was like a ghost writer. I didn't see it. You guys saw it.

Speaker 3:          02:46:55       I didn't see it. Well you know what I say we need them. So exciting was shit like that is going on and the UFC truck has the best in the world. Like mark till the grotto and all those dudes back there. Anthony Giordano and the whole crew. They're always moving. Mark [inaudible] Mark Tog Rodney motherfucker. He works, he figures out what the replacement. I love him. He's like, he didn't know that. Take it from the best. I didn't know that. I fucking love that dude. He's the shit he's, he does like, he'll like pick the play by play angles. He'll pick like shit and cause fights because he knows. Yeah. Todd Feldman Raid Bank off a fucking Francis by the way. He did big bank. Damn. I'm telling you dude, if that guy keeps learning and it seems like he got out, he had a weird spot. But you know what I really like about that weird spot that he got into? He was honest about it. He said, I carried over fear from my last fight guy who can look at himself that honestly ego plus his ego got out of control because he was not going to dude's out and then that's a good thing.

Speaker 3:          02:47:58       He said that in an interview like even as his ego's his coaches, like he just thought he was bigger than the game. Got humbled and now he fucking just knocked out Cain Velasquez before that he murked fucking homeboy. Yup. Chris Blades. Hi. Can't remember the name. He looked, he looked like he was in a different weight category. I can't remember the Alaska. He's the based on your strength, you know, it is like the future is an athlete that really at 265 pounds, it doesn't have to gain any weight. It doesn't have to lose anyway. Oh, they're going to show it to us again. The the future is until we've talked how, who is this? Her debut a Fox. Cain gets knocked up by G jds. Jesus Christ. You have ESPN. He gets knocked up by Francis. He took that jab right there to Frances. Frances clipped him with a Hard Jab.

Speaker 3:          02:48:44       Yeah. He's so fun. Understand what you're saying. Okay. That's a legit point. I just wanted to be like, oh, 100% some quick fast and gum. I want to say that again. I want to look at how fast he is. Back up just a wee bit. Yes. Out of the play. This over and over. Let's look. Let's look at this. The kitchen. We're sweet. See he hits him. Nothing fucking right hand shovel. It's can we get slow mo is that he hits him with a right going into the faith. Pursue, pursue. He said, see you try one more time. I think his knees. Okay. Right now. Nah. Hell No. Ooh. Wait a minute. That's why I came to him and he goes, I can't really keep close to sue. He's so powerful. Watch this. Watch this. Play, play, pause, play, pause, play, pause, play pucks, directv guy.

Speaker 3:          02:49:40       He gets a VCR in the nineties this angle, it looks like we're trying to get a TV in the nineties for sure is a good angle for in Ghana right here. Oh right. Watch this. Watch his head move. Ooh. And then he got clipped and that's what I, that's why I came. Did it, address that and he goes, I got to close too soon. He's too, when you, when you think about a person that might be like for period the cocaine party where you're saying you think about a person like he, you know he's, he's essentially like optimize it to 65 or he's optimized. He's like a fish, a real to 65 for five rounds of July is optimize. Well here's the thing though, he all he has to do is get better at that first round and do you really think a lot of guys are going to make it into their second or third now?

Speaker 3:          02:50:28       Just play it in slow motion. Fuck, I missed this angle. It looks like you missed this and I don't really know. He shoveled. Who Know us. Can we hold on, hold on, hold on. Slow motion kind of percent. That's clips of the hundred percent says that you see his head move. That's why I came to throws a single leg on the ref cause he's concussed. He went for the single Francis is the scariest of all time of all time over ubering. Dude. The thing about Francis speed, he's, he's learning at this like really rapid rate. When you look at a guy that's only been doing it for how many years now? A hundred percent train has been fighting for two weeks. He's been fighting for like maybe five years, I think five years from the time he learns martial arts. His Dad was some legendary fights. He was doing this with saying, dude, he's a movie character. If he can just get over the hump that he got, look the steep pay me. Oh, chicks fight. That's what's up man. I mean he got to the top of the mount dude. He's fun. DC now bend your boy k. Alright. Alright. Michael Jai White Guy. Like terrified right now how Francis Michael just to spawn is huge. But Francis is a giant. Francis has giant.

Speaker 3:          02:51:53       The giant. No, I've trained with him. He's nowhere near as big short and he's still played rock. You train with Hoop, right? Michael Jai white came into a box somewhere. Maybe he's not as tall spawn

Speaker 8:          02:52:06       and John knew. Maybe he's not as tall as him, but in the movies you could make them taller. Oh for sure. Be The permanent jet fighter. Oh 100% I was kid. I watch Michael Jai white do a hopping sidekick on a bag at legends and snap the chain. The chain broke. You remember that? He has, he has he ever had? Nope. He fought. Fought some cute boy Joey lights in the spawn. He's legit. Blackbelt and Cook Shin Flexing nobody. Nobody is more critical judge of kicking technique than me. The kicks. Perfect. He does everything. He's a monk. 100% legit black belt. So I'm telling Michael Shy why about how he's a black male for sure. This is a real quick, there's a good story. Let me finish this while he's here. Michael, I'm telling Michael Jai white over and over. I'm trying to explain to him how bad of a motherfucker Joe is with that turn inside sidekick.

Speaker 8:          02:52:56       I go, dude, I'm telling Michael Shy why all the stories that there's so many stories of Joe hitting the bag in front of traditional martial artists. You know, nobody can kick the bag. Like fucking show. Yeah. Everybody knows that now cause it's all over youtube at fifth. But before that I was the one trying to fucking tell everybody because I'm hanging out with Joe. He's kicking the fucker. That della grout there when he's holding that thing you were kicking out and everybody, GSP freaks out when he GSP freaks out. When Joe Rogan kicks, I and I knew I had a film this year. So weird, flexible. You can do the splits. Let me finish. Let me finish the story real quick. Let me just finish. It just seems really crazy. So I'm sitting there and listen, let me just fuck. I'm telling Michael's I white all about Joe Rogan's turning sidekick.

Speaker 8:          02:53:46       I'm blowing them the fuck up. Telling him the GSP story that's on youtube that has a million, gazillion views. All this shit everybody knows about us now. The old taekwondo footage just coming out when he's fucking, there's a, there's a a clip with Joe do an attorney inside sidekick hitting the dude and the guy drops. You know what I mean? And George's walks away like he's seen him, like he's done it a million times. He's just, you know, so he's become like this legend. So I'm telling Michael, shy Hawaiian, all this at legends and then we walk up to the fucking the bag. He goes, I got a pretty good turn inside kicked too. Oh, she's Atlanta. This was a real story. He fucking does this. This was like eight years ago. He fucking just asked. Mogens does a turn inside. Kik blows the bag off the shit. Hold on a second. I've done 30 minutes talking shit about you. I think you are. I think I was there for the a hundred percent of it, but I'm pretty sure he did a hopping sidekick. He just attorney tech. Nope. It's all about the attorney was 100% whatever it is. His Texas deal. His techniques and people, Bro. Did he ever do team martial arts or shitty about deep doing like high level martial arts? Like he fought Kilkee shit. I know he fired like real kill Kachin fights and not only was I embarrassed because I just, and

Speaker 5:          02:55:04       he just fucking broke precedent. The first thing I thought was like, Oh shit. Chris Riley owned the gym. My, Oh shit. We got to hide the chain. We turned it into one of those grappling bags that you fucking mountain and beat the shit out of him. But we had to get rid of the chain and he looks like a legit athlete. He's seen in a movie that's Michael Eddy is talking about kicking bags and shit. My Hook DIY blocks up to this bag. Literally chain breaks and it goes flying. Did you ever see Miss Bondo and someone said to me afterwards, yeah, we're having a problem with that chain. Like shut the fuck up. It's like you wouldn't have any problem with that chain. Can you imagine if I would've just said, well anyways, chose kick. Amazing. I shut the fuck up about you. I never brought you up ever again.

Speaker 5:          02:56:00       You went ham on that bag though. Huh? You some fucking, that's a real story. People would get up and walk out of the Goddamn movie if you put that in a goddamn move. Yeah, I saw him flying spot. Brian Cowen, we're talking about one thing at a time for, no, I'm just saying like basketball and nobody is watching this. Most people have a high teen went. You know what? Let me, let me try and hit the Mitts. He'd beat up everybody. There's certain athletes and this is what I'm thinking about Cain and want to thinking about Francis tonight. There's certain athletes that if they can get the mental game into a place, a lot of Warlick Cain was when he was at its peak. Yeah. It's all it's about. It's all about like how easy is it for you? How much do you have to work for it?

Speaker 5:          02:56:52       How much of the reason why you're successful is because you've built up this insane work ethic so you have phenomenal cardio and an ability to push and can you get a guy who has that but spectacular genetics, like how do you get to Michael Jordan? How do you get a Brock Lesnar heart? How'd you get, how'd he get out freak and can you get that freak to train the way like the best train Coby Bryant, can you get that freak, a genetic freak who has advanced and not have to say there's a big difference. Like you might be a great athlete, you might be a great athlete, but can you, when you get hit in the face, when you get knocked out, what are you like when you, what are you like the next day at practice? How much does that get in your head? I think certain sliders 100% and people that doesn't deter them and some people it would know. Talking to her sparkly, I said, did you ever want to do play football? He goes, hey, he goes, he's so big. And he goes, ha, those guy I played for one day and I was like, these guys are crazy. They Bang into each other. You're just, I want to cure 100 pounds. So it happened with Saab costus. Yes. Where he's like, football's bad. There's should be Ct. They went, cool,

Speaker 4:          02:58:01       why don't you sit the Superbowl out? Yup. His, his exact words were someone told him that he crossed a line. Yeah. Well he is on their platform and network shit. That's like you shitting on the UFC. The UFC would go cool. That's your belief and you're probably right, but we can't have you on our airwaves. Well, there's gotta be a way to say that on your show and you're like talking shit on them. Well, listen, let me tell you something. These dean, Dana White is one of the first guys to tell people to stop. He's one of the first guys to tell people to stop. He told chuck to stop. He was paying chocolate's not fight. Don't fight. It goes, I'll pay you to not fight. I do not want you to fight. Yeah, I killed. Tell guys that he can make millions of dollars off. No, don't fight.

Speaker 4:          02:58:42       Wow. They make plenty of money. I mean, there's people that want to fight and there's, this is where the real philosophical debate comes in. Like if you think, Gosh, you're retired, but he doesn't think he should retire, but he's going to die some day and so are you who said, tell you to say fighters you can and can't do if you have to say fighters. You're right, you're right. And he's right. Everybody's right. That's the problem. It's like one of those really complicated debates where it's like, what does that mean to do that? To Brendan? Yes, but I love him and I knew he was on his way out. I knew he was on his way out and I, I would hope that if I was fighting and someone was close to me and knew when I, when I was like really good when I was doing taekwondo tournament, who got to a point when I was somewhere around like 20 or 21 when I realized it was no future in that and I started dropping off and one of the things was because I started training with other young guys, they'll like a lot of guys who are doing kickboxing and boxing and I realized, oh, they're doing it the way I used to do it, but I'm not doing it that way anymore.

Speaker 4:          02:59:40       It's that they're obsessed really in the gym all day. They're living it. And I realized, I was like, you know, I had met some, some young guys, one kid, this Guy Dana Rosenblatt and want to be in New England middle weight boxing champion had we did a lot of training together. He was a really tough kitchen and find on Tuesday night fights. Yeah, he fought Vinnie. Patsy enza twice. This is rob mutherfucker knocked out Terry Norris who was obsessed with it. Yeah. Not Excuse me. Yes he did knock out turn yours. Um, he was a legit knocked out. Howard Davis Jr too. He was legit. He was the the boxing coach from American top team. And you sparred with them a little bit, right? Yes, a lot. He beat the shit out of me too. Did he clipped them though once? I definitely did that but I hit him. But the thing is like, he let me know from sparring with him that he was, he was way more focused on fighting than I was and I used to think I was as focused as I used to be and then I realize, oh, I'm not anymore here.

Speaker 4:          03:00:36       I'm a 20 year old guy with a bunch of jobs, so a 21 year old guy with a bunch of jobs and here's this kid who was, I think at the time he was 18 he was kickboxing and boxing and he and I talked about it. I was like, dude, you just box. He's like, you think I go, yeah, you're boxing is fucking awesome because when we at spar, that's where he would fuck me up. He would fuck me up with boxing. I'm like, dude, there's no money in kickboxing. There was no money back then. Zero, but there's some glory pays.

Speaker 3:          03:01:00       Bella tour pays. You can make money. Lion fight pays this. There's plenty guys. It's hard bop computer, the sports, but the PKA PKA, but what I'm saying is that's gen zero money. You're saying that kid was super passionate about it. That's 100% and I was like, I've got to get out of this. I'm going to get brain damage. I'm like, these young guys are going to fuck me and spar with them. With kicks. Yeah, we split. We did Botox, we kick boxed and we boxed, boxed. You ever land side kicks on his ass? Um, we sparred, man. I don't remember. It was like we were 21 years old. I'm sure I hit him, but my take from it wasn't, you know, my take from it 100% was oh this guy's way more focused than I am. Yeah. I had my foot out the door and so when I saw that you had your foot out the door, I was like, shit, he's got his foot out the door.

Speaker 3:          03:01:50       Thank God you did. Oh, cause I saw it and was like, life is so good, right? Yeah. But I saw it and I was like, dude, come on. Have a real chance. A real chance. You have struck while the iron was hot. Boom. You had a giant golden opening. I was like, Dude, you're funny guy. Like you're a, you're a fun guy to listen to. I like hanging around with you. Other people don't like you too. They're going to like you on podcasts and do it. Stand up. You don't have to get punched in the face. And he misses fighting every day. Look at him, but you can't give that advice to everybody and a lot of people got mad at me for giving that advice. I'm like, I wouldn't not anybody. Family members, we love. Joe saw it and I was like, oh, this is like fuck.

Speaker 3:          03:02:34       I'd like a part of your past. You know what I mean? Like you got some other shit. I can't believe I did that dude. I was like, this is the hill I'm willing to die on. I know you don't want to be doing this. No one wants to tell you don't want to be doing this. No thank you. I love it. Thank you brother. Thank you for listening. Thank you for listening because instead of like losing a friend, you know what the noise, I have a friend grow. It is weird. I did that for a site like the competitor came out. I was like, Fuck Joe, man. Two Oh five and I was dieting training and I was like, what the fuck am I doing? I Sunday night shut my first comedy special. I knew it was you open. We've got a good life is great. Perfect. Lenny's pictures of us, all three of us. No, I've never told anybody to do that before, but I didn't cry, so let's move up for man. It's like we love you, man. You almost started crying when you were going out there because I'm about to cry. I fuck this.

Speaker 3:          03:03:29       I don't know if you miss fighting or whatever. Just know. Just like, Oh God. Okay. What's crazy is I did, I did stand up comedy people hang out with Joe back then once Roy Nelson Cro, Cro, cop fight that. How crazy is this? Amazing. Amazing. I knew it. I knew you could do it because you have a pro athletes work ethic applied to something that you really enjoy. You might be doing comedy comedian 100% I'm like, no,

Speaker 5:          03:03:58       you know what? If you, I'm going to be honest, I'd go Brett and got a lot of size on I love, I wouldn't be the Joe Rogan Latin fucking turning sidekick. Look at me right then and decided to fight Joe. It hit me. He kills both of us if it ended up on the ground. No ways Brennan going to be able to finish. Joe. No one. Really. You don't think so impossible. Let me, can I just say one thing? Joe got to be what you got to worry about. Joe, Eddie, Eddie, Joe. Is anyone else? Samara talks about himself and the Joel. Fuck. Excuse me sir. Can I just have to say one thing? I know I have seen brand new shop with the, some of the best. He's just two guys in the world and I've watched him tap them every 12 seconds and I'll tell you the names afterwards, some money, and you're going to go like, listen, I saw Brendan a hundred percent stall out with Cyborg and getting his guard and go to the ground with him purposefully called the [inaudible].

Speaker 5:          03:04:59       This is no way. No, listen, I'm not dogging your to stop it. If not, he would crush me like a bus stop. Got Moist towns, big team. I, I gave him his black. Here's what, here's where I'm at at. He know what? He's joking. Tap me out right now. If we're debtors, I wouldn't give a fuck. Good for you and working on new material. I don't give a fantasy world to that. Let me be honest. I've never tapped anybody who was any good anywhere near as big as he was spreading shop. Take the best in the world. It wouldn't happen. This physical advantages that people have that are so, they're so stunning. They're so stunning that it's creepy. Brendon has the reach I, I'll give you a name when I tell you the name.

Speaker 5:          03:05:48       He's a giant. Yes. People that they get ahold of you. It's, it's confusing. I watched Roy. I'm going to be honest, he ain't got no cardio. Any shops in the 600 pounds for rags. You can't talk over each other. I'm trying to tell you, I'm trying to give you props. I'm saying I'm going back to Brennan Cause I know Brendan's and fucking Colorado. He's in the fucking mountains. I will listen to me. Listen to me. He tried new material about being a backstreet boy, puts it really well. He puts those yoga mats on his hips and does like 500 pound fuck thrusts. Yeah, I'll just settle down bro. He's a different kind of person. It's a different kind of humor. That's what I'm saying. I know the difference between, you always got no chance, man. You know how many times I saw him get through around and I want her to give him advice on what he did wrong. He was like, shut up. And I'm like, I can't breathe. Breathe right down to it. That's an interesting thing. I've never done more cardio in my life. I do cardio like super record cause those fills you run or no joke. Your boys

Speaker 3:          03:06:56       had aerosol. Helped me out. Them get there. My car. Did you finally get one? Microsoft? I love, no, my cardio was, my cardio was always the worst part of my Jujitsu game. When you got, when you got somebody in a fuck in the truck and you put a crotch rep or on Joe would just read through people's legs. It's a crotch ripper. It's uh, it's a, it's like a banana split and and rescue team. Yeah. But it's a little different than legs are spread differently. Uh, Joe, her bucket, the master of that motherfucker crushed. He scratched me. But it's awful submission because it gets, it goes against your hips. Are there any other comedians who like wrestled or anything like that? I'm on. It's just a really good wrestler. He's really good. He teaches. We wrestled the same houses there at the company more and Jay. Mark can wrestle.

Speaker 3:          03:07:45       No, no, no. Jay Moore can wrestle around with Jay a little, but people tell me that Jay Moore actually has coach wrestling. Well, Jay Morris not. I know he's not. He's all right. But he's never coast it. Look, coach Jay wasn't a real wrestling. Jade. Jade heard cook can. I'm just being, oh my God. Look at this. Crash on TV. Holy Shit. Oh my God. Look at all these cars. I, oh my God. I thought walls at the moon. It's round Eddie. That's fake. This whole thing is fake. The crash. Fake look. They know the laws don't work. Oh man, this shit. Oh, look at this pile up to look at this. This is insane. These guys calling you think, uh, 202 miles an hour. So true. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          03:08:28       She was great on the podcast. I like this. A really, really, really nice guy. And talk about a guy who's had some problems with concussions. 1000 concussion. Dale Earnhardt, man, he had to go to rehab for this fucking crash. Man. You're all different crashes flat in the same day. Oh my God. In the same day. That's what the fuck is a really, they sharpen up 100% watch. Do you watch it? Take the family to the raceway at good night. Three, four crashes. Let's take it. Let's take a guess. Let's Google it. Eddie, what's your guesses? What's that? Do you think there's a crash? No, no, no. I believe Jamie cause he's from Ohio. Daniel Watch. I'm going to go with James. I think Jamie's correct watches now I will say most and in some kind of a crash, Colorado, all that shit. It's all the same guys. All the same dude who won it. Cause I could give two fucks. Racing is a weird thing. Imagine taking your family to spending 200 bucks on the race and there's no crash and average of 220 crashes per year. It's through how sheets. Maybe show the race every day. If they raced every weekend, that's a shit load of crap.

Speaker 3:          03:09:51       I'm going to close. Don't worry us every weekend. So, but to the, to the main guys, coffee, counting all the amateur races, Jesus talking about the assholes in the back burner. That scars the top demolition. Then boys make bank though. Huh? Just left turns all day. A lot of money. Is there racing that goes the other way? Do they ever say a good question? Is there, is that piece so hard? Probably in, in uh, some, well, the real racing is Formula One, correct? My boy. Yeah. Well that's a different thing. You know, I was watching the, there's a, on youtube, there's a video of an overlap between a gt three car, which is like a Porsche like Brendan has and a Formula One car. It's like, Geez, strikes, there's so much faster. You watch the GT three car, you're like, oh, that guy's flying. And then you see the Formula One car.

Speaker 3:          03:10:43       I see that. Do you have a video? Yeah, there's a video of it. See if you got online comparison between Formula One and gt three t three it's like a Porsche. Do you know how big Talladega nights the sequel would be? Oh, motherfuck. Right. Especially if they can get bore out to jump on board. Are you kidding me, Bobby? He was amazing. Who's better than John C. Reilly and and remains a feral when they're together. She, I know it's fucking magic. Yeah, it might be it. Look at that. Look at the difference. So get this si the one in the left and one of the right leads and one on the right. The one of the rights flowing. Your one left, his GD three. It's fucking crazy. The difference here, that car and then watch it. Look, it was faster. Oh Shit. Oh my God. Is real racing.

Speaker 3:          03:11:30       That's why Europeans think Americans are goofy. Fuck. Nd you're marsh. That's Formula One. Formula One. Basically you're like sitting on a missile. Well, they're also honest. If you see it's a changing course, like the course to Formula One course has a lot of turns, right? I mean, what, give me see if you could get a a, a map of, it's like an like a crazy track when a NASCAR's just a circle. Exactly. Exactly. Nascar's look or an oval. Right? When people say, I, I do have street courses. I don't usually do it though. What is a, what's an average formula? Like pull up a famous, what's a, what's a famous formula? One race. They have a bunch, right? Sure. Uh, I know there's a famous formula one race, Mario Andretti. Famous Formula One race. Race her, right? No race. A race isn't the one in Monaco.

Speaker 3:          03:12:28       Isn't that one? Do you know what that one's called? Grand Prix de Monaco turns in it. Yeah. Okay. Let me see what that looks like. Let's see what that looks like, Jamie. Hey, this grateful man. That shit. Look at all those turns. God Damn. Those are crazy. Look at the upper right hand corner. Like a fish's mouth. Look at that crazy turn like an eel face. Like the Nascar thing is why don't they want all that shit? Cause they want to be able to see the whole race from whether city. I think it's because here you can't see shit. You're sitting formula for the cars to pass by. Like this sucks. That's why there's nobody there. There's like four people standing there. You wonder what the car just race. I get it. Those fucking country guys think you're right.

Speaker 3:          03:13:21       You're right to get to see. It's like, aw, he's right. Are you listening to and fucking tense and shit may have barbecues. Yeah, to get see 30 seconds of car. Meanwhile, the country, they're the ones that are geniuses. This wreck happened this year and the girl fucks up. I had someone die. I don't want to say no. She broke her neck. She's back though. She's pretty hot too. She's still racing shell. Yeah, she's back right now. Broke man. That she just, maybe there was just bone spurs in there. Oh my God. She's wearing flies into the wall. Flew into the wall. She's young too. She's all right though. She's only 17 she races formula one. He's not legal. Fuck Dude. How crazy is that?

Speaker 3:          03:14:12       Her parents got assigned sign for that Shit for sure. Go to school for the other one is so expensive, like just to have more expensive. Does it? Wow. How come so much fucking European pricing? Some tellers in the Rothschilds? Is that what they do? It's like it is even Nati dude. How couldn't it be? It would be, what if it was, I know it is. What if it was would it is? It's just a quick Google search price to run it or not a for me the one racist. What the fuck are you saying Jamie? Hold on. Listen to Jamie here for a moment please. I just quickly Google search to an average team costs anywhere between 20 to 60 million for Nascar. Yeah, for f one it's anywhere between 200 and it's around 250 million. It says first expensive. Yeah, and those like red bull, Mercedes, Ferrari, Porsche. Those boys make bank to you. Hey Buddy. Daniel Lewis Hamilton. How it Lewis Hamilton was a mixed family. His Dad would fucking work like three jobs just because it's so expensive as kid to do it. He's like, I'll pay for it, but he got a, when he got a fucking winning, if I'm going to do this, knows about it, but it's fuck, there's so much money. America, America doesn't know about it. My brother does guys, we've got to stop talking about,

Speaker 4:          03:15:50       no, go ahead. No Buddy. There's no like nope. Kids aren't into formula one racing. You're born into like the Vanderbilt, the fucking airman's. You know what I mean? They don't, there's the masses are not into this shit. You and I are not getting a chance, but is that a newer one? That's only in America, right? In Europe. It's very funny. The kids don't give a fuck about that shit in Europe. Fuck up. The two kids, they love it. They love it. I think that's incorrect. I think, oh you're the Rockefellers are into it. I think that's incorrect. They like it in Australia as well. As somebody who grew up overseas, I can promise you they kits in the Middle East. Express your rich dad and my, my father is a Vanderbilt. Damn, it's so popular area at Santa. So Senate, let's look at centers. Funeral, bring up areas, funeral in Brazil.

Speaker 4:          03:16:48       He died. He was the best. He was the best. And take a look at how many people showed up for his funeral in Brazil. Take a look at this place. Oh yeah, it's inquiry. Jackson eraser. Yeah he was, he was on TV. Like he got his son who races now I believe. So he was the greatest and he was such a monk. He wouldn't even hang it in the near West. We would, he was like a matador. He only, he only thought about racing and he's a beast dude. And I think a thing went through his, look at that. Look at that funeral. Everybody came out. Hold on buddy. Boy. Amazing documentary. Cause it's called Santa. You can get it on iTunes. Netflix maybe. I Dunno, maybe it's on that. Why is everything Netflix with you? It might not. I'm not sure. I'm not sure.

Speaker 4:          03:17:29       But I got it off of iTunes. It's fucking incredible, man. We see the footage. It's nice guys, man. It's, it's just like, I mean, you're living your life on these split second decisions and controlling some impossibly powerful vehicle when you're going around. He's fucking turns and everything's happening so fast. And this guy just had this lightning precision ability to make decisions. He was a hero. Well, it's like Dale Earnhardt jr when his, when his pappy died, then they fix the car. So no one's really died. What's his dad died? They're like, we need to fix this shit. And now there's all sorts of safety stuff in it. It's, um, that was a fascinating conversation about how many concussions that guys had because I never would've thought of that. How many did he have? A ton. He had to forget to do rehab for a bunch of Rehab and he had like moments where we're like, for six months he was just a mess.

Speaker 4:          03:18:18       Andy Stone, uh, like he, he, he's had so many concussions because they would blast doors and he would be the one to set the charge. Now, all his friends are hanging Haydn and he'd be like, where the fuck am I going to go? [inaudible] he's had over like 201 that Kevin will got shot in the hip. Can't, can't feel his, his foot from the why is he staying with you right now? Because he had no, he had place to stay but I go stay with me. What the, what are you doing? I got, you know, to have a fucking bad day. When we were on the man show we had a sketch

Speaker 5:          03:18:48       that got declined. It was about an Asian Nascar driver. Oh that's right. It was blowing up because he was just always racking and tolerance drove the ratings up so they, everybody wanted out cause he would just sketch. It would have to have an Asian guy. Right? Like if Bobby Lee wrote that, it would be cool. But the most epic rallies, people loved him. What do we got here? We're watching golf. How dare us. She never played the shit. Played it. I played a lot, a lot. Big happy plays right once a year and a cheer camp, but they can't wire tap you out. And the fact that golf course, you know, that's why that's what all those rich people, they're out there going. I'm glad you guys agreed that you have the same view on politics. How we control shit. Yeah, that's just an excuse. Is there a one game that symbolizes more like really super rich dudes out there making deals playing a game like golf?

Speaker 5:          03:19:48       They literally tell you if you want to succeed in business that people tell you what it should learn how to play golf. Tell us how it happens. He doesn't go out there playing golf up business. Just the magic theoretically like, oh Jay, if I'll tell you I'll make all the stores. How does it go down? A good story for you. Tell me about it. So my mother and my father, this guy comes out to play golf with my father who was a big investment guy and he wanted my father who invest in his company in this investment from whatever thing is, this is 19 2090 1990 Yup. Yup, Yup. 1990 and my he, they got to play golf in Greenwich, Connecticut. My mother watches him. Everybody cheats at golf, but my mother sees him kick the ball just a little bit into a better lie because it he, he was in a taller grass, kicked the ball on to like shorter grass. We'd get a better swing. Here's the difference. When I do that, I go, I'm kicking the ball and he did it, but he looked around and make sure nobody was watching. My mother, Sicilian girl from New York City just went, snake, she's a fucking snitch, bro.

Speaker 5:          03:21:05       Mother goes, wow. That guy just cheated secretly and it's a bullshit games. She goes, bad guy. She says, my father got the hatch. She goes, she goes, watch it. She goes, what did they say in this thing? That guy's a crook and my father goes, bullshit. She goes, if you do, I'm going to divorce. My father goes, Jesus, you're really serious. She was all divorce. You. Well, Hey, what if you were playing chicken guy, went to jail, guy went to jail. I 15 years like I was. Donald Trump was a huge deal. I'll tell you his name afterwards, but it's a huge, he was a huge fucking scam artists. He was one of those guys in the news. Everything else, that whole thing. Everybody who invests, who went broke, he don't do shit. Her Mama talents a snitch. You know that guy? You know that guy. Gosh.

Speaker 8:          03:21:46       Okay. So, okay, so what, use the little things in life you can pick up here. Perfect example, Eddie. Remember there was one time where Eddie met this guy and the guy just started doing Jujitsu, like he was a white belt and he called Eddie up and he told that he, yeah, I got a bunch of guys, I'm like triangle today. Armbar guy. And he was like, what the fuck are you talking about? And like, you knew like right away, like this is this guy's full of shit. Like triangle a bunch of people and arm bar people. It's your first day. You don't even know how to do those things. I didn't hear, but he knew right away like Eddie and talking to him, he was like, what? Because the only reason he started doing Jujitsu is because we were, he wanted us to cope, promote some kind of martial arts event.

Speaker 8:          03:22:33       And I didn't know, I didn't know if he was a legit promoter nod. He seemed really cool. He knew some cool, he knew some people that I knew and he was, he had, he wanted to do this show and he was going to involve me in it and it, you know, then he came down to my school and, uh, and after one class he's telling me the next day, oh, I fucking loved it man. I triangle the couple of guys fucking arm bar. I'm like, wait a minute, first day ever. He goes, yeah. So crazy just comes natural to me. And I thought, shit, maybe I shouldn't go into business with this. Exactly. So right there I was like, I got to back out now. This is my fucking line about Gigi. He'll lie about everything else. And so, um, that came a time where I had to sit him down, you know, but it was ugly and kick him out of the Joe and I, Joe and I are there ever since we were like we'd known each other through a 28 and we just be talking and then like I'd say something I like, yeah.

Speaker 8:          03:23:23       I was like, I don't know. I, I do. Yeah. I, uh, thought whatever it might be. Like I tapped him out. Now I'm like, not really, you know, whatever we'd say, are you telling a little white lie? Cause you're just, you're just, it's convenient and you have to walk in. You're like, math didn't happen. But it's a weird thing when people make shit up though. Yeah. He was a Kung Fu champion. Travel Okinawan fun everyone bare knuckle where it was a fun, that was a lot of those guys. When I first opened up 10th planet, this was 2004, there was a girl that trained there and she just started turning their shoes or like a crossfit type chick. She was like buff and she just started, she's like six months into it and she starts telling me that she tapped uh, one of my purple belts and she's 105 pounds.

Speaker 8:          03:24:07       I'm like, damn, I know what you tell we tab Cade say that. And I said, okay, cause I don't want people to have like a false sense of security in Jujitsu. You got to know it was, you can't, if someone, if you, sometimes when you go with the kid, you let them take an arm bar. You know what I mean? You let them when their kids, but when they're adults, if you do that to them, they're going to actually think they really tapped you. They're not going to know. Some of them. Southern mom will say, oh he let me, he's being, he's gone. Like he let me, he's going like some will go, fuck, I'm tapping these motherfuckers out and I'm a bad motherfucker.

Speaker 5:          03:24:44       Yeah. And this girl totally thought that. Well I remember when I first learned to man, I was a little confused. I was like, what's happening here? My actually tapping this person. This doesn't make any sense. I figured it out pretty quick and the girl called me, the girl called me and said, hey listen, I'm excited. I just won first place in my division and second place in absolute call back on an Italian up calm. She was so excited. She won first place in her division and second place in absolutes. How many matches do you think she won? Two zero. Oh well did everybody forfeit division? Cause no one showed up. Know she had one match in absolute and she lost. I'll see wonder division and she got the second and the lesson she was acting like she wanted a lottery. There was a girl crying and shit. There was a guy when I date like it's insane. American idol.

Speaker 5:          03:25:54       Weird. I tell people do that. Like I said, I went on a date with a girl and she was weird. We want on a, and I was like, this is weird. Just did Cynthia. She was just weird, just a little zany. And then I get a call from her a year later and she goes, um, make sure you watch. It was like a show. Like the practice was, I make sure you worked prior to that. Why? She goes, um, because my hands are in it and I put like, I push a door, I'm not kidding. And I go, I go, I started laughing. I mean, yeah, right. I go, well my hands are, my hands are, you'll see my hands. And I pushed her. I'm just calling my friends Tom Cause that's like my first team. I go, I go, you got to get out more or their hand after you got to get out.

Speaker 5:          03:26:33       More goes, why don't I go? You can't go. You can't tell people that you can't call people. She goes, I have my whole family. Watch it when he's talking about is my first time. And to be, I guess it's not, it's your hands. Cause I guess Glenn close to somebody who was going to push the door, but they used her hands instead. Well, she's not going to do a cleanse. And I go, I go, you can't. You can't tell me. It was true. I was so excited and she's a good person, but I was in her name. And you can't tell people that. You can't tell them because they're going to think it's weird. And some people just don't have a gauge. Maybe for how weird might be a big deal to them. The you don't like. You're on all these big Josh and know that that's not a big deal. She comes from a small town. She's like, look, those are my huge part of it. A huge part of success is knowing when you suck and when you're good. That's not a matter of sucking your goodies and matter of not being that important a moment, but for likes you. She thinks maybe you'd want to see her. Oh, that's my friend Alice. His hands. No, we hadn't come. [inaudible]

Speaker 5:          03:27:31       everybody may be or warm. Maybe she's trying to reconnect. You know I was number 78 I wish that was true. Maybe she was Tracy

Speaker 4:          03:27:42       being stupid. It's too, she wasn't enemy. I'm promising a well-read, handsome gentleman with a real six pack without either real career and she just trying to fuck. She likes strange widdled down wrists and hey man, don't say anything on my wrist, but I'm sensitive about that shit. Protein pokey risks as you took your shirt. I'm an idiot. I'm an idiot. How ridiculous. And I took my shirt off and I was throwing punches and see your friends, man. The only difference is you're better at being a person than you were when you were 32 or 22 or it's all just stuck in your ways. No, you're better at being a person. You're better at doing it with like the least amount of fucking stress. More friendly in life. You better at life, but at the end of the day you're just a person. It's all the same shit. Shred.

Speaker 4:          03:28:37       Did he have, what? Does the obliques, a six back route or route not even show it. Take Root. Yeah, he wouldn't. It just when guys pulled their sweat pants down too. I know Dan has a couple of pictures like that. Comedians do that take it as a totally normal. It's a weird thing that you know, it's kind of grown. I think it's going to go the way of the bell bottom. Personally. It doesn't make, no one shows it. Now this guys are still slinging it. There's this game. They're still wearing fucking affliction and the game his dick, I can't, I don't have to show his dick. He's at fat day. I want to let you guys know that I coopt I'm, that's my term Dick Route. I invented that shit until the lexicon. You know my boy Brett aren't says that guy's got a good root. It's aggressive route, but that's a different thing. That's different. He's talking about the fiscal tick itself. He's talking about the root is the base like the bottom of the treat bro. Like where the League is. Good thing in DC are clear in that picture.

Speaker 4:          03:29:44       He's got a Mac book or being clear on the right there. Well you know they're skyping them in man. That's the difference between like ESPN from decades ago and now people don't give a fuck. I think about how many youtube videos that people watch it. They're all going and you and shit. They don't care. They want the information and your core me a talk. What's going on? You got to fight Frankie. I think he needs good production options. You know? He's like, you need to see Washington Post. He's going to defend his back again, brother. Wow. He's, he's DC versus Francis would be Faulk and crazy still calling DC. Wow. Really? I don't bet against DC. It's hard to bet against and gone. No, that guy really, I mean you could tell how much stronger you Jon Jones usually cane throws people around but he couldn't throw. This dude came from kinds of strategy.

Speaker 4:          03:30:40       John John would beat friends. Let me tell you something Jones. Yeah. Wow. I bet. $5. John's on another level now or something. $5 don't mean that. The thing about if you get a DC fort, Francis DC would not eat. You know he, he has more options. He's, he's healthier than Cain is. Right. He's got more options in terms of the way he moves. 40 also. Yeah, he is. But also he's got success at heavyweight against Steve Pay. He's won the Strikeforce Grand Prix. I mean he threw trash down at around like he was a fucking tank man. He was a tank when he was in Strikeforce at two oh five you know, it may very well be that he fights at its best at heavyweight, him in John Five you wait because dcs power heavyweight wake up. We've never seen John Heavily. I don't want to see them at light heavy. We've seen how that works out.

Speaker 4:          03:31:31       It's just not, it would be a phenomenal fight. It heavy heavyweight heavyweight. It'd be phenomenal. But this guy at heavyweight, this is, that's the scariest one. I find John Scarier. Ooh, I find John Scared. I think it'll be like a DC avenging. His brother's lost. Oh, there it is. There going to be ended up, the DC's going to retire in March. He says when he turns 40 which Dana's might shut your fucking mouth if they keep cup when I say so here's your money pulls out that John. Here's Brock. There's John or here's Frances. Yeah. Wow. Impressive. Just from his stature as the most impressive fighter to ever step in the octagon. In terms of what he has to work with as far as being five, nine, five, 10 minutes. He's, he's told them that he's, I think he's five 11 you see at least five, 10 let's say five 10 let's give it a five. 10 year righties below six feet tall and he's a tank and shoulders are narrow and just takes and his base undefeated. Except for John Jones. It's astonishing. It's, he saw Jason. Jamie could find out right now. But you, the Google doesn't count for height and weight. Yeah. Instagram hit me standing next to him. It's so weird. He's outstanding. UFC fuck the UFC. How he's still here now. You could only put shank.

Speaker 4:          03:32:51       You could wear high heels guys. Fred SIPOC. Carmen at six five he's six to shake shaker. I'm pretty sure it's like is probably the shortest heavyweight champion in the history of the sport. Right? Oh, he's a hall of fame right there in Ghana. Well that'd be nice to say it like 10 times more muscular than that dude and God, I was a real true, unusual person. Oh Shit. Snap. You just want thing. I don't give a fuck bouts. College basketball. I don't care either. But it's weird though, when you see these markets and understand it. When you see these athletes like like a Lebron James who's like a clear top of the food chain freak. When you, when you see one of those guys, you see more of those guys and things like basketball and football clearly. Right? What do you mean more? You mean to all of them?

Speaker 4:          03:33:41       All of them, right? What are the numbers? So it's not all, but what do you think it would be honest. Yeah. Yeah. Freaks. We're the freaks and the MBA. Mba has the biggest free NBA. Nfl. Let's just add them all. Let's go three gas free and alignments go off three together. How about your boy, your corn Fred Fan, you Brett brought to San Diego. Who's that? Jackie. Okay. That gigantic gentleman. He's from another gene. Cool. I don't know. Fucking super nice guy. Skinny right now. So big. She has legs and has the worst that you've ever seen. Football, fast food every day. This is the perfect example because this is a to hitting each other all day long, different sport. They're tackling each. Wow. You know what I mean? There's swells up freaks and bolts, Herschel Walker freaks in the NBA and the green down the freaks. Two guys that are just throwing balls.

Speaker 4:          03:34:35       There's some freaks, different kind of beast right there, guys with the ball. Nobody tackling him against a guy that where there's people trying to kill you. It's the nature of the sport. But as far as pure athletic ability, NBA has the biggest freaks in the world. Wow. Tallest guys is what you mean. Although like all over. So you have these specimens, you have these specimens, the same day Lewis, you have these specimens to stand out and almost every sport. Right. And Brock Brock Lesnar is a great example of that. What basketball play can fuck with Ray Lewis? Name One and what asked me what we were just fighting. No, no, no. You did as a castle. Hey Eddie were talking about before and if you did it to Kathleen of all the athletes from NBA, NFL, Nhl. No, no I don't. I'm a football guy. The NBA beats all of them in terms of like ton of raw food.

Speaker 4:          03:35:27       Yeah, like speed jump, no. Everything Jill. Annoying. It's basketball by far. So let, let's just say dominating another man. But let's just say, let's just, let's just say, let's go, let's go NFL. Let's go NBA, UFC. Just narrow it down to those three. Yes, he's waiting. But what are the, right, but what are the percentages of real freaks? Like the Brock Lesnar type freaks in the and the NFL and NBA. Who gets the most, who gets the most NFL and what does that number get down to the UFC to 10% is it 22% of Tutsis freak athletes? Wow. And I'd say nine or 6% fell felon. Nine 9% and below you're a freak because unusual. Hugely, hugely unusual in every facet. Like, Oh, you look at a Lebron James, you look at mean fill in the blank. There's, there's a bunch of guys and majority player he played in there. You look at all the fuck golden state warriors to creek free. Jack Three. Yeah. Yeah. Height is important. And basketball because basketball for sure, but I mean I'm an Irish fight and football too. Well, you know when

Speaker 1:          03:36:36       you're talking about fighting, football's a way more violent encounter and people that would like be probably better at fighting would be drawn to that. More of a freak to be in that more of a violent sport has a mass port. Especially to be like super competitive. Every cell is way higher than the NBA. Well here's the other thing too. It's, wait, there's way more on the line is way more on the line in regards to in the NFL physical punishment. Exactly. But that's watch flooded cause you're willing to run into a wall or get punched. It doesn't mean that that's how you're ready. Separate roles. But we need super athletic guys to survive in this sport. But here's the thing, so important in the UFC going on, there's not enough money. But here's the thing. What if, what if those guys are still trickling over there nodding the UFC?

Speaker 1:          03:37:21       Why would they trickle over the jail? Well because they think that they could educate chance at controlling their destiny fighting than they would if they think 20 years colliding with people all the time when the football field thinking about colliding with people, it's like, I really feel like certain guys like look at Ryan Bader, his last few fights, I mean they were talking about this, they were talking about this in the belt or broadcast. I got the guy barely got hit and like three fights. He won the heavyweight Grand Prix and punch against worldclass competent much money you make. I don't know. That's a good question. I'm sure you've made a shitload of money football player to be begging like 10 million a year. But the thing is like he controlled his destiny in these encounters, which I don't think you totally can and football, but still Ryan Bader, the money he makes and the longevity and all that, is that as a fraction where the NFL or NBA hundred percent.

Speaker 1:          03:38:11       So you might be the most famous guy in the world, but there's the guy who's the third string quarterback on the San Diego chargers who makes more money. Exactly. No, you're right. I'm 100% with Earth's train. Third string stuff. They only carry two and then these days it's just an exaggeration. Wouldn't you rather be the guy who controls his own destiny? Like the thing about like, oh, because for every guy, sorry, judged for every guy that controls his destiny. A lot of those guys are fucked over because you have a pension to Indiana. Well pastry to college and there's a blueprint. Pop water, high school. I'm good. I get a college education. I'm good. I get drafted. In effect, he made $150,000 flat and then he made taxes. That's a punk ass. Yeah. What do you think you made, um, with its sponsors and shit cause you belt or you can do this policy.

Speaker 1:          03:38:57       Let's say me $250,000 on top of that all to all told a hundred grand. Wow. That's about it. Huh? He's a world champion. He's a double champion. Yeah. Yeah. He's a world champion. Light heavyweight and heavyweight over there. That's a weird thing, right? That world champion thing. It's almost like no one should be able to just remember they tried to do that shit with fader. They tried to give him the Wilma. They gave him the go wham world, the Wham a championship. I was that. They invented a Wilma and everybody was like, why did you call it hey were you when you were watching cro cop or last night I thought, are they a new cro cop paid? Wow.

Speaker 3:          03:39:34       That run through your mind is coke ups. First I belts I went, I put two can do set up cro, cop fade or I watch this shit or hate and the shit if they both sit and that's, that's where I'm at with those guys. Right. Like if they still want to do a coke cro cop, Avi competitor wants to do the baby. You still want to talk about a fighting? Well it'd be hard. I would really want to talk to some. Joey EOL was great cause I knew Joey in a new URL. Like when Joey and Eol we're together and Joey was like translating back and forth. That was great. But I would have to really know someone real well. Who spoke? Russian friends. Any Russian spies? Callen Columbia dead. Carolyn's got some connections meet by. We got to go to the beach and pick up a bottle with a message and they say fate or his favorite place. There's red lobster and his favorite clothing stores. Abercrombie, which I find fascinating. That smell and plus them pretty faces on the lookout recovery. Not For me. I go to the law. What do you look for? Starbucks down the street. Starbucks. Starbucks gun to your head. You're going to one store. Nordstrom's. Dan, what about Bloomingdale's? No Bra. They're nice too.

Speaker 3:          03:40:50       Conspiratorial jeans. I went in there to buy my wife some jeans. I'm like, God dammit. These motherfuckers are 400 cheap. What are your sense? Has higher quality clothing shop good before you leave this podcast, you're less of a human. No, it's okay. It's okay. I don't want to talk to you guys. Hate me for it. You know what I want. I want one. One example at why we should believe the earth is flat. That's what I want. You son of a bitch. You want it so bad and I am high drunk. You guys want that to as long as it's a joke and it's funny, I'm cold, it gets angry. It's not fun. I'm not married to that. I'm not married to it convinced me that it's flat. There's no way I could do that. God really? There's not one example. It takes about a year and a half and like wanting to have this too much. Very hard. They locked urination so strong. You look at your sons cartoons. It's all space. I look at all my shit, all the shit my son likes, his everything is, they're taking space. Still doing research on this currently in space space. Want to direct everyone to Hashtag spaces fake. I've been doing research and space being fake. Is that real? That's a real site. Hashtag spaces fake is something I'm investigating for my next hour for legitimately looking deep into like what space do you dumb motherfucker.

Speaker 3:          03:42:17       It's the same thing. You got it all wrong. You got it all wrong. This is not very organized. Know what I'm saying is you couldn't have it all wrong. Nobody. Anybody that thinks the earth is flat, they totally don't believe what

Speaker 8:          03:42:32       we're taught about what's above us. So to bake in the sun, they mean all the information we're getting. You're lying about that shit that, it's not that it doesn't exist. Of course it exists. We see of course, but space is fake. Sounds ridiculous. Like there's, there's, I'm not looking at it and it's it. It's fake. That's ridiculous. That's not what it means. It means that all the information we got to buy, all the lights in the sky, something alive. They're lying. They're line too. There's a reason that I tell you, but you guys would don't want to hear it. Hold on. So I don't want to talk to give us the cliff notes. The cliff notes are man, ah, have you studied any kind of a, he doesn't need to be. Let's hear. Just so few of us. The goal has always been for the most powerful emperors is a one world government.

Speaker 8:          03:43:26       Always wanted a one world government. All of the Roman emperors, they try to figure out, they tried to do different combinations. How about him? And they would fall. And they were a new emperor would come and go, you know what? I'm going to fucking rule domination. I'm not going to let my soldiers get married that way. We'll have a stronger army. They have different philosophies. Everyone believed different shit, but they all wanted a one world government. There's no way to have a fucking Walmart with government it. Nobody's into that shit. Not even other rules from small countries or like one world government that's going to put me out of a job. Fuck your one world government. People don't know shit about politics. Don't want a one world government. There's no way you're going to sell the one world government. It's impossible. The only way, the only way to make a one world government work is to have the people embrace it.

Speaker 8:          03:44:14       They have to want it because nobody wants it. So the trick is to make, to make people want it, to embrace it. There's only one way I got to pee. There's only Miss Alice. I noticed. I don't know. The only way, and the known this forever, the Vatican knew this, the Vatican, the pope water to rule the world. They all knew it, but they couldn't do it. They all knew it, but they knew one way, but there's no how they're going to put it on man. The only way is if there was some extra terrestrial threat from up above us, that would be the only way to have everyone embrace the one world government. They all knew that for years. That's the plan. They can never make that. They didn't have the technology 500 years ago. The Vatican knew about it, they wanted it, and you go to the Vatican, you see paintings, that paintings of like, have you met those with aliens in them and back when I used to believe in Ufos, but before I figured out that um, Ufo is where are they want us to believe in Ufos.

Speaker 8:          03:45:20       They're preparing us for a fake alien invasion. That's always been the plan. A one world government, the only way to do it is to get us to embrace it. And the way to embrace it is from an alien attack. Ronald Reagan talked about it many times at the UN CFR. He talked about it because one it make, he looked at all the, the leaders of the, of the nature of the world and said, what did it make our lives easier if we just had some, you know, some kind of extra terrestrial threat. He said, that shit, he said that in front of the UN wouldn't aw, like he's trying to get everybody into then too. I don't think he ever said that, but no, no. He said that many times. It's an video. Ronald Reagan, Ronald Reagan was vice president. He was talking about, and there's many videos of him saying, we are what lies before us.

Speaker 8:          03:46:11       He's in front of the nation doing it. State of the Union address, saying what lies before us. Is the opportunity to forge a new world, order a world, an order? Because he's talking about like, isn't that means that the spaces fate? Yes. No, no, no, no, no. When people ask me, why would they fake space? It's always been about a fake alien attack. You can't have a fake alien. Never apologize. Never to kind of a fake alien attack without space. I've never heard of politics. He got that space first. So they always, you know, who promoted space more than anybody who want Nazis, Nazis before the Nazis, you know, Mayans, the VAT, again, they have all the biggest, uh, they have all the astronomers. They're all Jesuit, Vatican, all of them, all the ones that are giving us this information about space. They all come from the Vatican. The Vatican has the most beautiful hotels come here and know what the name of the most powerful, you know what it's name is the most powerful telescope. The Bat again, and you know what name it is. I've done the research on Youtube. Hi Nancy.

Speaker 8:          03:47:17       This do you want to chill? Is the most bellow power telescope in the world? It's in the Vatican. But do you know what's Lucifer that falls Lucifer's Dick and balls. I've never seen this fucking talent scouts, real legit dude. Uh, I think the biggest ones in Chile, I think they have to be in high altitude paddock. Yeah. I don't think it's enough. And so when people ask me why would they fake all this shit? But I don't think that's the biggest thing is just a crazy theory. I'm trying to, I'm just, it certainly, we're talking to these Ellis, these funny theory, but Eddie, these new chilay, very large array telescopes that they're creating are fucking gigantic. And they take over enormous pieces of land. Listen, I was with Google those very large, it's called no, it's called the very large telescope telescope. I watched the documentary with you at your house.

Speaker 8:          03:48:05       It was like 2001 and I think in five years they're gonna be putting a documentary about them putting together the very large telescope in Chile and they're talking about by the year 2005 we're going to have this, we're going to have three telescopes are linked with a computer to make us, we're going to see further into space than ever before. None of that shit came. What are you talking about? Came, is that up? Is a very, very large array up yet. Nope. Large telescope. Um, but I know they have the, they have them in Hawaii. We said weird. Isn't it weird that every space documentary, all the series, I had them all, Jo, Adam, all, we watch them all the time. I tried to remember all this shit about a neutron star and a super hyper Nova. I was ballsy and Joe were balls deep in space and then every now and then we'd watch this documentary after documentary.

Speaker 8:          03:48:57       Morgan Freeman ain't got the universe. We call that shit. I DVR it, all that shit. Anything that said space was fucking ball. I thought it was better than people and shit cause I knew so much about space and every now and then I'd watch all that shit and wonder and wonder what, this is all cartoons. Eddie won, but this is a cartoon. And then I go, okay, whatever, whatever. And then I keep watching all DVDs on space or I'll see GI. There's nothing real and everyone watches that. They believe it. The narration is all programming what's above us and what we're on. We're being lied to. Once you go flat, you never go back.

Speaker 5:          03:49:33       Listen, if you look a campaign, listen was about everything. It's not about, it's not about who is the one thing.

Speaker 8:          03:49:41       This is the one thing I want to say. Okay. It's like it's not that we believe something ridiculous and you don't, you don't believe it. We're gullible. We're gullible. We, we believe some weird shit about the flatter. We believe some weird shit. You don't believe it. You're smart. It's not about that. It's about we actually don't know what we're on and we always say that we don't know, but based on all the shit that we got by the mainstream, we don't believe that. Here's what I do believe that it's not that we believe something crazy and you don't because you smell it.

Speaker 5:          03:50:14       What is narrow sense? It get a totally different tone we looked at as you from now and we don't pay any of that. Yeah, but you use, you use that microphone. Use a cell phone. Right? It's science. Hold on. I believe at that time I believe in it. Okay. Why do you believe in that study? I don't need to read something to verify, but you better benefit consignments. You benefit from. It's not every day. I know. I love this. To cut this off, it's 10 o'clock. Come see me in Vancouver at the vogue theater and in Salt Lake City at wiseguys march one and two. I love science. I love science. I don't want to fight. I want to laugh about it. I'm an idiot. I believe in flat earth. I'm crazy. That's all you need to know. Pasadena Ice House fight, companion show shit. Wednesday night, 10:00 PM Hauler, boy, Miami Improv. I only got March 16th, 2017 in Washington DC. March. I'm in Miami. Prov march. Brand new Miami and the stories don't listen to me. And I'm in Washington, D C and D. Dot. K. Dot. God love you guys.
