Speaker 1:          00:00:02       Was Jamie here the last time I was here or was that, oh, okay.

Speaker 2:          00:00:04       It's remarkable. In many experience.

Speaker 3:          00:00:10       Joe Rogan podcast by night darkness. That's Jamie. We're talking about antiquarian. Welcome. Like from here, she brought Mr Ana Kasparian,

Speaker 2:          00:00:25       the boyfriend's here. So all you all, you sad dude's at home, don't like Eh. No, no, no. It's never gonna happen. Now she's got a boyfriend. She's here. Were boozing it up too.

Speaker 1:          00:00:35       Well, he's gotta be on his a game at all times because I don't know, maybe it could have

Speaker 2:          00:00:41       terrible way to start a podcast. He's amazing. He is amazing. He's wearing pajamas, nighttime. Just give a fuck. I like it. Plus it's Cuban. I've got a big respect for Cubans. So, uh, yeah, we're, we're back with Cuba, right? Isn't that the new thing that's going to be able to go over and get some nice cigars now?

Speaker 1:          00:01:01       Yeah. No, Congress needs to get involved. Right. And Obama can't unilaterally lift the embargo. But I think that overall this is good news. And I know that there are Cubans in Miami that her against this and they think it's a terrible idea. But look, the embargo lasted 52 years and it didn't end communism. It just strengthened the Castro regime so

Speaker 2:          00:01:19       well made things really weird. You ever look at those photos of Cuba and you see the 1950s cars that they evolve fixed up. It's kind of fascinating.

Speaker 1:          00:01:27       It really is. I mean, when you can't import vehicles from the United States, you know, you gotta keep up with the vehicles that you have. So they are in perfect, impeccable condition.

Speaker 2:          00:01:38       It's crazy. It's weird to watch like you see like a red light and as these photos of these cars into like beautiful, like classic cars that are all in great shape, you know, and makes you realize like we're kind of trapped in this cycle of constantly getting new shit, constantly getting the, oh it's a 2016 Lexus, you know, we get so excited about the new one or the new ones. Headlights move when you move like, Oh fucking Christ. Like we could get by with these 1950s cars and we really wanted to set the brake suck in the suspension sucks.

Speaker 1:          00:02:09       Look, I'm not an expert in cars at all, but I will say that the vehicles that are being built now won't last as long as the cars that were built in like the 1950s like do you think a car that was built in 19 I'm sorry, 2014 is going to last 40 years or even a few decades.

Speaker 2:          00:02:25       I wonder, I don't know. I don't know enough to say whether or not they're really built better. I just think they were, there's a weird thing that happened between like 1960 and then into the 1970s and eighties where cars just sucked. And like in the 1960s like between like 1964 65 like the old Corvettes and going into like the muscle cars are the classic 1967 Camaro's of those kinds of cars. Those are some of the best looking cars human beings have ever figured out. And they had this weird sort of like flair to them that you just don't get from cars that came from the 90s. Like those cars look like shit. Like I was, we were watching this auction once and uh, they had, uh, we talked about on the podcast, don't worry about the Camaro that was for sale and they had a Camaro for several year, 2002 Camaro and everybody's like, kit, that fucking piece of Shit Outta here. Nobody cares about a 12 year old Camaro kid out of here. Wow. But like a 30, 40 year old Camaro is that shit. Yup. You know, so somehow or another we like, we, we entered into this era where people don't want to fix those things up. You just want to get rid of them. Like there's like pockets where people like, you know, you don't fix up a 2002 Camaro. Get rid of that fucking, yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:03:37       Thanks. Yeah. That's so true. Um, there was a neighbor I had that had this amazing Red Mustang. I don't know which year it was, but it was just such a beautifully crafted vehicle and I compared that classic car to the mustangs that are being built today. And I felt like there was no comparison. There was something sexy about that car. And the mustangs are sexy today too, but not to the same extent. Do you know it has like the curves of a woman almost when you look at a Mustang from decades ago.

Speaker 2:          00:04:05       Yeah. So they figured something out. Yeah. I don't know what it is, but they figured something out from like in the 1960s where they figured out how to make these cars just like, whoa. You look at them. This is just classic shape. Yeah. I think that's coming back though. I think the last few generations of American cars, they've really figured out like some of the new Cadillacs are beautiful.

Speaker 1:          00:04:24       They really are incredible. So I recently leased a new car, um, and I settled on a BMW and it's a great car. It's a little three series. Um, I really wanted like a white exterior with red interior cause I'm an Armenian. But um, it's in the blood. Yeah, it is. It's in the blood. We like flashy shit. So it was funny because I remember talking to Christian, my boyfriend about possibly getting a Cadillac and he was like, yeah, it kind of locks are cool. But they still kind of have like the old man stigma attached to them even though they're beautiful.

Speaker 2:          00:05:00       Yeah, they do a little bit. Right. Yeah. Even though the new ones that are spaceshipy, they still have that thing. It's like for the longest time that's what they were.

Speaker 1:          00:05:08       Yeah. But I really have no room to talk before I got the BMW, I was driving a Lincoln. Those are very old manner as they got his old man. I loved that car. It was an Mkz hybrid. It wasn't like a hip car, but it was smooth. Right.

Speaker 2:          00:05:25       They've adjusted, you know, American cars over the last few years have really adjusted. Especially it seems like, especially since, um, they got all that money to sort of rebuild, you know, there was like a lot of restructuring and it just seems like they came out with some pretty exciting cars, like some really nice cars now.

Speaker 1:          00:05:40       Well, they had no choice after that bailout. You better fucking deliver. I mean,

Speaker 2:          00:05:44       yeah. Yeah. David made the, in the world of muscle cars, they've made amazing, amazing cars. They have a new Camaro out, z 28 that is like essentially you could buy a race car from the, from the Chevy dealership. I mean it's, it's a real car. It's got

Speaker 4:          00:05:58       500 plus horsepower. It doesn't even have a radio. It has a speaker on the door. It doesn't have air conditioning. It's at this ridiculously, they wanted to make it as light as possible. Right. Of course. Light battery and it's, you know, but it's insanely like, like capable, like for a car that you can just buy. I mean this thing can run on a track. It pulls like more than one g of its own bodyweight sideways and it's a Camaro.

Speaker 1:          00:06:24       Yeah. That, that's impressive. But I always wonder about people who buy cars like that. Like are you really going to take it to a track? Probably not. Are you going to drag race it? You probably shouldn't.

Speaker 4:          00:06:32       Probably shouldn't, but yeah, even if you're driving legal speeds, those cars are way more fun than regular cars. Yeah, definitely. Even if you're just getting onto the highway, just that a moment of acceleration to merge and you don't have that in like a Honda or in a volt.

Speaker 1:          00:06:51       So I shouldn't, yeah, I shouldn't be admitting this because it's probably not a good idea on the road. But I have like a little bit of road rage and my least favorite thing on the planet is when I want to be respectful, I want to follow the rules and I put my turn signal on and I want to switch lanes. Right. And the motherfucker behind me sees that. I put, sorry, I put the, I put the turn signal on or whatever and he or she starts speeding up so I won't be able to pass. Right. And with the Lincoln, I wasn't able to speed up enough to like cut them off. But now at the BMW I'm like, Oh, you're going to speed up. Well then I'm going to cut your ass off. I love it. It's such a good feeling.

Speaker 4:          00:07:26       That's so ridiculous. Why don't, why don't we do that? Do you catch yourself doing that? Like accelerating and then just go, why am I getting involved getting involved in this? No, no, I never had a war. I go to war. That's so crazy. Don't you think it would be like healthier for all involved if you just like, just let, let this motherfucker,

Speaker 1:          00:07:44       you do what would be healthy if we all respect one another's opinions without getting outraged. If we were more compassionate and empathetic, but we're not, we're animals and we're hateful and we're not inherently kind.

Speaker 4:          00:07:58       Don't you think that that's not universal though? I know a lot of people who are, don't, you know a lot of people who are,

Speaker 1:          00:08:04       I know people who are kind and I think it's of course a mix of nature and nurture. Right, right. I don't know. It's funny because I was having this conversation on um, the point, which is one of the shows I host for TYT network. And I said, you know, doing this job, and especially this year I started feeling a little more depressed and it was because I started realizing that there are a lot of really bad people out there. You're exposed to it on a regular basis through the news stories that you cover through the emails you get through the tweets that you read through the comments that you see. And it's discouraging. It's disheartening. And I'm trying, I'm like in a Rut right now. I'm trying to rise above it and not let it get to me. But you know, you hear the police brutality stories, you hear the, you know, the cases where people get shot and killed and there is no justice for them. You read how people will be supportive of those types of behaviors. You're like, what world am I living in? You know?

Speaker 5:          00:08:58       Yeah. It's very challenging. Uh, you're, you're dealing with insane numbers. I mean, that's one of the parts of the world that's so hard to handle and manage and in this day and age, so you're dealing with the influence of billions of people literally now. I mean, there's, there's so much news and there's so many stories that just the sheer numbers of human beings and then extreme poverty, extreme disparity and how much people have and how much advantage they've had been born in certain situations. The resentment of that ramp and crime in your neighborhood growing up in these neighborhoods. I mean, there's just so many people and so many people that just have a shit roll of the dice. They just got a shit life, you know,

Speaker 1:          00:09:40       and you have to be aware of that and you kind of have to understand where people are coming from when they're, you know, not necessarily the best people on the planet, but at the same time, look, the Internet just exposes you to things that are way outside your bubble. Right? So I remember when we covered the whole ray rice story, um, and you know, we saw that surveillance footage of him knocking his fiance out with one punch. You know, of course we condemn the action. And a lot of people were like, what do you mean? What do you mean you'd, she was, she was mouthing off you. Did you see what she was doing? She was charging at him. And it's like ray rice is a freaking football player, is much larger than her. I mean, she can't really do much damage to him. Right. And so I get the, I get the argument that, oh, if someone's attacking you, you should be able to defend yourself, but you should also know your own strength. Right? So we make that argument. We got so much hate on those ray rice videos. It was amazing and I couldn't understand it and I still don't understand it.

Speaker 5:          00:10:34       Yeah, that's hard. You know, I grew up, when I was a little kid, I saw my dad hit my mom and my mom moved out like immediately afterwards. And I'll never forget it. I'll never forget like seeing that and it's, it's uh, there's a big difference. It's like a little kid trying to kick your ass and so you need him in the face and knock them unconscious. Like you wouldn't do that with a little kid. Right. You'd hold them off. Well, if it's a woman and you're a 230 pound, 240 pounds super athlete, I mean a fucking super athlete. He received that guy run like Jesus Christ.

Speaker 1:          00:11:14       I haven't seen him run, but I've seen him knock someone out. The single

Speaker 5:          00:11:17       it was, was a nice left hook. Actually he had good technique like the way through it and really knows how to throw a punch because it was in a short range. A lot of guys would have wound up too much and they would have never landed it from, from that position. So as an analyst it was a very good punt, but it was rude as fuck that he did that when she just kind of slapped him in his head he shouldn't have. The other thing is, this is what people don't like to talk about, but it's, it's a reality is that guys who've experienced a lot of head trauma or way quicker to pull the trigger, the weight quicker to react a very impulsive

Speaker 1:          00:11:54       way. I love that you brought that up because while we were discussing that story, I brought up the potential of all of the head trauma leading to more violent behavior and look, I'm not a neuroscientist. I don't know. That was just my speculation, but I think that it's a pretty good hypothesis that I'd want, I'd want to look into a little further. But yeah, real real sports thing on it recently. No, I haven't.

Speaker 5:          00:12:17       Yeah, they did a piece on it or they were talking about, um, people who were like really kindhearted and normal and very peaceful. And then once he started playing football and they experienced a few head injuries, their personality shifted and they became like really angry and really aggressive and really just, and a lot of people think that it has to do with depression, which is like super common as well for the guys who experienced some significant head trauma. And at this depression might make these guys like more quick to snap or more angry or more impulsive. And that's a lot of, that's just related to head trauma. And that's, that's a, that's a scary reality that comes with football.

Speaker 1:          00:12:57       Yeah, I look, I wouldn't be surprised at, look, I don't watch much UFC stuff. Actually. I don't watch any, I'm not going to lie to you, but I know, I know. But is there a head trauma involved with that as well? I mean, you're using your full body to beat the shit out of someone. No, no, no, of course. That's the point. So were you ever surround about that?

Speaker 5:          00:13:15       Well, I think for the athletes it's um, it's a risk that pretty much everyone is aware of at this point. And many of them, I think they impose like a threshold they impose themselves. Like if I get knocked out too many times, if I feel like it's happening too much, but I feel like I can't take a punch anymore, I'm going to get out. And a lot of guys have done this and done this like really intelligently and uh, made speeches about it and you know, put a blog entries about it. But it's a common theme is that these fighters, they realize at a certain point in time they're not durable anymore. They get hit and they get hurt really bad really easily. And then they start really being worried. And that's smart. The smart thing to do is to get out then. But unfortunately you can't tell someone when they can and can't compete. So some guys, they stay too long and they have those two, three fights that they probably shouldn't have had. And those are hard, hard

Speaker 1:          00:14:15       to watch. Well, you know, we had this discussion about whether or not in let's say a few decades football will be outlawed because of the head trauma that a lot of these players in door. And you know, my argument to that would be, it's not always the answer to ban things, right? So for instance, banning marijuana didn't work. Banning drugs didn't work. Right? But one thing that you could do is actually educate people as much as possible about, you know, the consequences of doing such things and then they can make an educated decision about it with the NFL, the NFL withheld records and studies from its players so they wouldn't know about what this head trauma would do to them in the long run. And so if I were like a legislator or something, I wouldn't advocate for banning certain sports. But I would say, look, there needs to be more transparency. There needs to be more education. That way people can make a decision for themselves. Now it's Kinda hard to do that when you're 18 and you've been drafted out of high school. But you know, nonetheless, I feel like more education is the best way to handle a situation like that.

Speaker 5:          00:15:17       Well, I think because of the data that's in now, I think it's undeniable, but I think for a long time it was one of those things like when cigarettes first became illegal, you know, there was like a lot of resistance to make it not illegal rather. But when the cigarettes, uh, became, uh, like responsible for cancer, when they became like responsible and started having to pay out payments and having to uh, like did tobacco, I mean how much, how much money of tobacco companies had to pay out in these giant lawsuit. It's like billions and billions of dollars, but they're still making so much money that it's, it's, it's viable for them to stay in production. But at one point in time they were completely denying that there is there any link between cigarettes and cancer. Amazing. They were, they were literally getting doctors to prescribe cigarettes. I mean, that was like a common prescription for like wheat kids. They had prescribed that little fucker cigarettes. Right.

Speaker 1:          00:16:05       I mean, similar things are happening right now. Similar things or harming children, but like guys in their twenties right? Similar things are happening right now with pharmaceutical companies and some of these prescription drugs, I mean, things that are being marketed as harmless are being pushed on kids that shouldn't be taking pharmaceutical drugs right now. It's amazing.

Speaker 5:          00:16:24       Yeah, it is amazing. And I think that when the f the football players have all demonstrated this consistent pattern of brain trauma, you know, if they, they kid each other all the time and they're trying to figure out how to mitigate that. But along the way, the data becomes undeniable. So now they're at that same spot where they're like, the tobacco companies were okay, cigarettes cause cancer, but we still want it to be legal, you know? Okay, okay. Football causes brain damage, but we still want to play it. Do you guys still want to play football? Who wants to make money? Right? You make money, right? You worried about getting hit and had a couple of times, okay, we're going to do our best to not hit heads together, but we're playing fucking football because women are Americans. Yeah. Yeah. Right. That's what happens and dudes will fucking march out there, bro. I'll fucking keep banging heads. I'll still bang heads. I'm going to fucking bang heads and get penalised. Yeah, we're animals. We're savages. Especially like when you are just a complete stud athlete and you're involved in this ultra competitive world of try to dominate other stud athletes and spike balls in their face and they're just fucking out there.

Speaker 1:          00:17:30       Yeah, going to play. I got to admit, I just visualize a stew, super stud athletes spiking the ball and I got a little turned off so I can understand why they do it. I can understand you imagine that's, you see what?

Speaker 5:          00:17:44       I don't watch much football but I love highlight reels. I love watching ESPN because they'll show like the best shit. I don't have

Speaker 4:          00:17:50       time. I don't understand the downs. I really don't. I don't even know the rules. I don't know the rules of football. Neither do I. So we're on the same boat. Who's you're calling flags? I'm like, what is all this rest? Why is everybody resting? That should be just constant chaos. I would want to see it like an MMA bout. This is too fucking, yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:18:05       Five guys on this side. Five guys in that side moved the ball, go chaos. Craziness. No breaks. Yeah. When you get it across, you fucking march it back the other way and do it that way. And no breaks, no breaks, no this whistle blowing. And that white guy off the fucking field, a little tiny white guy with the white outfit, he's going to get killed. So he's going to accidentally run over that fucker and he's going to die. 300 pound men on who knows God. What kind of concoctions that are made in laboratories that have allowed them to grow so big. Yeah, I mean I feel the same. I'm going to sound so stupid to your male audience because I don't know the ins and outs of sports. I'm not a big sports fan, but that's kind of how I feel about professional basketball games.

Speaker 1:          00:18:49       Right? So like I go and see Christian play basketball and I love it because they don't take any breaks and I'm like awesome. I get to watch them play and I really get into it. You Watch the NBA and there was like a freaking timeout called every two minutes and you're like, Jesus Christ, just keep playing the game. And I understand there are good reasons for it. It's all part of the strategy. But for someone like me who's not a big sports fan, I get turned off really quickly because I'm like, oh great. Next commercial break. All right, we're going to wait. Like it loses the momentum of the game and I lose interest.

Speaker 4:          00:19:18       Well, for sports fans, I think what happens is you have these highs and lows and you just sort of like settle in through the lows while they're blown whistles and moving guys over here and talking about this and arguing about that. And it gives you things to debate. Like that's a bullshit call. There's fucking ref to retard and it gives you shit to talk about when you're at home. Like I like when a on Twitter, after fights, I don't even fucking read comments. I'm like the last people I want to hear about his people that didn't like the way I call a fight on Saturday. There's fucking queer and he's fucking fake Jujitsu. Those, it's just like opening up the devil's asshole and looking for advice get and this, but that's part of the fun part of the fun of being a sports fan is getting pissed off at shit and it's like, it's an American outlet, a uniquely American outlet.

Speaker 4:          00:20:10       Like American sports radio. I've done a bunch of radio shows with sports radio guys. They're very unique and that they'll just start shitting on these players. Well let's, let's be honest, he's lazy. The fucking guy never gets up before practice. He's not putting in the extra hours. She doesn't want it and like, oh, I got to agree with you. He's got no heart. He's got no art. He's a fucking super athlete in the NFL. What the fuck are you talking about? Yeah, but that's the style of like shitting on them and they get these free shots because I mean this guy is a ray rice or a super athlete type dude. I mean, not ray rice, because his, his thing wasn't about sport itself. It was about violence. But like, you

Speaker 6:          00:20:47       know, pick one, you know, pick any superstar who's a superstar football player, like awesome. Running back, uh, currently demarco Murray, demarco Murray. It's like that guy that's, you know, come on. Dealing with stud athletes. Very rare people. Yeah. I think the issue with the head traumas 60, he's gonna do it no matter what. They're just going to do it well, that's on them. Like I, I believe in individual liberty. If you want to do something that's going to harm yourself, then you should have the freedom to do it right. But I want to make sure that there's as much information and education out there as possible. So you make an educated decision. That's true. Yeah. I think that's true. Or that's a, that's a very valid, and the, the idea that they knew about the damage beforehand, they withheld it. That's not cool. That means you're working with people who don't really like you.

Speaker 6:          00:21:36       Well, the NFL agreed to a settlement. I don't remember the exact, uh, number. It was 200 million, a little more than $200 million. I remembered that. But I don't remember the exact figure. Anyway, part of their settlement was that they wouldn't have to release the studies or the findings about the concussions and the head trauma. And I thought that that was so shady. Now that was the original settlement agreement and I believe a judge struck that down. So, um, we'll see what the outcome of it is. But yes, we reported on that over a year ago and it was wrong. I mean, when I read about that, I was like, how freaking shady are you guys think about it? They make so much money out of these athletes. And true, the athletes make millions of dollars in a lot of cases as well. But I mean, it's so disproportionate when you think about the health consequences of what they're playing.

Speaker 6:          00:22:28       Um, I don't know. I just, I worry about all that. But there's a good, you're, you're making a good argument. You know, it's also the, the other point that you have that's very good is that these guys are making millions of dollars and they wouldn't necessarily be making that kind of money doing other things. No, and they're uniquely built for sports. I mean these people, like if you were just around a guy who was the size of an NFL lineman and he just worked in your office, she'd be like, Jesus, the fuck you do like walk into him in the kitchen, you know, you're on your way to the coffee machine. You're like, what the fuck is this guy doing here? There's huge people like Matt Mitre. Aon is a fighter in the UFC. He was a, he was a Lineman, I believe he was a lineman in the NFL.

Speaker 6:          00:23:10       I know he played in the NFL. Look that up. See if there's a alignment. Every time I interview him he says, fucking giant human. Like if this guy was just hanging out at a bar and he was angry, you would be, ah, shit. The giants angry. You know, you want that guy worn out from football practice. Okay, fair. Want him running up hills and bash into other giant dudes. Like if you don't have that outlet for a dude, like that is terrifying. I mean, I'm sure that there could be precautions taken to lessen the number of people who suffer from co concussions. I don't know how, I don't know how interesting.

Speaker 5:          00:23:46       Because with a game like rugby, the rate of concussions is actually much lower than regular football players. Right. And it's because they don't have the same type of protection that football players have. So there are a lot more careful with what they do. Um, yeah. Yeah. Um, that's actually an issue with MMA as well. Uh, I've been actually saying over the last couple of months and I've had a bunch of guys agree with me that are fighters, that thing we shouldn't have gloves and the gloves, uh, what they're really doing is sometimes they actually, there's a lot of, I poke problems in the UFC and a lot of these guys are saying that the gloves actually are pulling your fingers apart. So as your hands get tired and you're fighting, sometimes the gloves are difficult to keep close. It actually requires resistance to close them. So there's accidental I pokes that are happening.

Speaker 5:          00:24:32       They think that with bare knuckles also you'd be more judicious with your punches because it's really easy to break your hand. Like especially if you hit someone in the head like in their forehead with the back of two knuckles, these were really weak. They're not really supportive that well I can karate that kind of teach you to use the front two muscles, front two knuckles rather. But if your bare handed you, you have a really high likelihood of hurting your hands and you also your wrists, I don't think you're rich should be taped up cause people get to tape their wrist, they table up tight and that what your risk doesn't move when you punch people to Lazio Punch him way harder because like you having your hands wrapped and everything like that, that's an unnatural state for your hands and it turns them into weapons because ordinarily they're kind of vulnerable and if you break them, it's huge.

Speaker 5:          00:25:17       A guy breaks his hand in a fight, has huge problems is now you can't punch with this hand effectively. You only have one hand. And if you, even if you have to grapple, like you probably are not going to able to squeeze hard with it, so you're fucked. Oh, what the hell it got you into UFC fighting like just an excess of testosterone. You want to beat the shit out of people. Like, Ooh, no, no, no. Honestly, I got into martial arts when I was a kid because I was very insecure and very lost and I needed something to like put me, put me in a challenging environment where I could put like some physical intensity into something that was very competitive and very dangerous and scary to me. So it became what the way my instructor used to describe it is that it's a vehicle for her human potential developing human potential.

Speaker 5:          00:26:06       And that when you're doing with martial arts is not, you're not trying to kick people's asses, you kind of are, but what you were really trying to do is you're trying to do something that's unbelievably difficult and scary. And in doing so, you develop your character in a very profound way that a lot of people don't. They don't experience the terror of someone trying to kick your head off. Like literally you feel the whoosh of heels going by your head that would have separated you from your consciousness with with no doubt, and you see it happening left and right around you see guys getting acts kicked in, the head, kicked in the head, turning side kick to the body and they crumble like they got hit by a car. I've just seen that so many times. It's how fine. I can't imagine what the adrenaline is like right before a fight.

Speaker 5:          00:26:55       It's very hard to manage. Some people have the biggest issues with managing the adrenaline and you see it in the UFC all the time with guys who were having their first fight. We've caught octagon shock because it's so intense like all these lights are on and the camera's on. You like, Holy Shit, I'm in the fucking UFC because they've been fighting and all these smaller organizations. Right? Very few people have seen it and they've developed this record and they've got some good skills and then all of a sudden this just wave of adrenaline hits them and they're like, Holy Shit. Their heart's going like you could see it. The breathing heavy. They're trying to calm themselves down. It's very hard to manage.

Speaker 6:          00:27:29       No, I can't imagine it. So one thing that I've always been really terrified about is I'm skydiving and I know, I know fuck all that. So Christian, I have been talking about doing it together. One

Speaker 5:          00:27:43       one one day, one the next day. The other way, if one of you dies, you can miss the other. If you both die together, it'd be so we'd feel like we're fucking, it is.

Speaker 7:          00:27:50       I know, I know. I love you. I love you too.

Speaker 6:          00:27:54       It's over. I feel like I'd almost prefer that if I, if I had an option between, that's the romantic, I guess you guys are really in love. It's unbearable. It's from Romeo and Juliet type shit. One of the things. One of the things that scares me about skydiving isn't even the act of me like already outside of the plane and seeing the ground come toward me. I'm more afraid of the feeling that you get, the adrenaline rush that you get before you jump out of the plane. I don't like a drone adrenaline. That's a shitty feeling. Okay? I don't understand. People that are adrenaline junkies, you're talking to them just

Speaker 5:          00:28:29       picturing feet on the edges, looking down, holding onto the side called, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck. I just, I can't, I mean, we're going to end up doing it, but I know I'm going to be miserable. Who was it that was on the podcast? Was it someone on the podcast? It told the story about the first time they went skydiving there. First parachute didn't work. They had to cut it off. Oh my God. Was that someone in the podcast? Was it someone someone was talking to me? Might've been Steve Graham. God didn't. No, it wasn't Steve. I've got to remember who the fuck told me this story. But they went skydiving and they're fucking parachute didn't work. They had, the guy had him, he put, he goes, we got an issue here. He goes, what would that mean? He goes, well, I'm going to have to cut this parachute loose and we're going to go with the backup.

Speaker 5:          00:29:13       And like what? He's like, what? So he's on the, you know, this guy's on his back, you know, this is how, you know, you know, they do that like they're about to choke you and that's how you fly through the air. I just wouldn't want to know. And he's fucking song off the other one so it doesn't get tangled up in the second one when he pulls the backup. And if that doesn't work, you're a Foxville. No, no. We're not doing it. Doing, I don't want to talk you out of it. But my, uh, my friend Brian, Brian Redman, you've met him. His Dad was working with this person. I forget it was a man or a woman. Was it a woman? He's told the store. I think it was a man. Um, working might've been woman. Anyway, we're working with this person and they were always trying to get them to skydive. Like, come on, you've got to come with us. It's awesome. It's such a rush. Oh yeah. Yeah. Okay. Just so I get to find the time, you know, I'm with my kid on the weekends and then one day he shows up at work at Monday and he's like, where's this person? They died skydiving. Oh my God. Really? Oh Shit.

Speaker 5:          00:30:16       That's you hitting a lawn. It's your body in the lawn coming from 10,000 feet. Just kidding towards earth being sucked into the gravity.

Speaker 6:          00:30:32       I feel like when I feel like my life's pretty exciting. Yeah. I have an exciting life. I don't need to jump out of a plane to feel like it's, and by the way, as I was looking up, um, you know, skydiving tickets and all that other stuff, I did look up the number of people that die per year due to skydiving accidents just to, and it's actually not as rare as I thought it would be. Okay. Like I thought it would be like one person has died over the last 10 years and I know there, there are a lot of accidents that happen. How many was it a year? I don't remember. But it was enough. Let's guess sky diving. It was like, I think it was like 11 out of a thousand or something like that. Maybe. I don't remember the number, but it was, it was, that alone is enough to make me uncommercial.

Speaker 5:          00:31:16       I don't know what that means though, as far as, I don't know how many people are skydiving. So if it's 1100 thousand how many yeah, many people do you think die every year? If you had to guess, I'm going to go with like 25.

Speaker 8:          00:31:27       Hmm.

Speaker 5:          00:31:28       Okay. Hold on. Don't pull it up yet cause I got a yes.

Speaker 8:          00:31:33       Yeah.

Speaker 5:          00:31:33       Hmm. Let's see. Um, I'm going to guess 50 50. Wow. That's a high number out of how many do you say? I Dunno, per year. Oh, all right. I got the number here. 42.5 fatalities per year.

Speaker 6:          00:31:48       42 fuck that.

Speaker 5:          00:31:51       It says the 1970s. Hold on. It says, uh, in the 1980s, the average was 34. Okay. What do you got? I got a 21 out of 3 million.

Speaker 5:          00:32:03       Hmm. In 2010, 2013 is the last year they have it and they have, it's 24 24 all right. As a 25 so that's still too much for me. Yeah, it's out of 3.2 million jumpers. But if you look at this calendar, this is pretty crazy because if you look at this, the schedule, what, what's the data? What's really crazy is they're showing you the numbers. You get 2013 and then you get 24 and then you get estimated animal annual jumps, 3.2 million. Okay. Fatalities per jump, very low. But when you look at it on paper, imagine you were living

Speaker 2:          00:32:40       in one town where this many people fell from the sky every year, okay? If all

Speaker 4:          00:32:46       skydiving was only in Kenosha, Wisconsin, and you're working on a farm in Kenosha, and you just, every day you're here, there's 32 and a fucking year, that's more than one a month. More than once a month. Someone falls from the fucking sky and die screaming as they slam into a planet. 2000 30202000130 five 35 bodies in a year falling from the sky. If it was in one neighborhood, it would fucking sock. It would literally be raining people every day. You would go outside terrified that you're going to fucking get in your car. Startup, good doge and a guy comes from the sky and slammed in the euro hoods, Joe, but you've already convinced me to not go sky diving. You don't need to do any more. I'm not trying to convince you, I'm not trying to convince you, but I'm just imagining that I'm living in a town. You know, just let's say Chicago. It's a city. It's a host city. Big City. 35 people fall from the fucking sky on a Chicago a year. You'd be like, what the fuck are you guys doing? And look, the craziest

Speaker 1:          00:33:55       part about it is it wasn't something necessary, right? It was something that you paid for and it's expensive. It's like hundreds of dollars to go skydiving. So you just paid hundreds of thousands of dollars, hundreds of thousands or hundreds of dollars to die.

Speaker 2:          00:34:10       Yeah. Well, yeah. Essentially with someone attached to your back, but it's gotta be a rush. Otherwise they wouldn't be doing it. Yeah. I don't need that rush. You know that that story was from Ryan Parsons and they had video. That's right. That's right. It was Ryan video of it. Oh God, that's right. No, we're not watching that. No, no, no, no, no, no, no. I don't mean to watch that. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:34:33       I don't even like hiking next to a cliff because I'm like worried. I might like step the wrong way and somehow roll down the cliff and die.

Speaker 2:          00:34:40       You have to worry about shit dropping on you too. Yeah. This room's things fall. You know, you always drive by when you're driving down roads and there's lows falling rock signs, you see rocks on the road. Yeah. Like if you're below one of those rocks, they hit you in the fucking head and your dad's Ville or your windshield. Yeah. It's scary. Okay.

Speaker 4:          00:34:58       There. But this is a certain amount of fun

Speaker 2:          00:35:02       in being in those weird environments that are kind of dangerous, like as long as you recognize it. It's where like hiking, it's when you do the, you're careful and you know what you're doing. There's like a certain weird thrill to it. When I was in Alaska, we were this island called Prince of Wales and uh, there was a deer that was below us and we were like sitting on the edge of this rock and it was literally a fucking cliff. So there's the edge of this cliff and I'm looked down, I'm like, yeah,

Speaker 4:          00:35:26       whole fucker. My whole body like Titan.

Speaker 2:          00:35:30       He's like, you don't want to go near that cliff, do you? I go, no, I don't want to go. I don't want to go near that cliff. Like I'm not going to sit like she's sitting there with his legs dangled over the edge. I'm like, that shit.

Speaker 4:          00:35:38       Fuck that shit for. Not any like, dad's not interested in sitting with his legs dangling over a cliff and there's like a fucking thousand foot drop underneath them or whatever the hell it is. 500 foot drop at least you're dead or you're like, no, no interest in that. No interest in that. That fucking thing that it does to your body when you see someone do that, when you look, look over a ledge and you see that view and you're like, oh the dude, some people get off on that, like not sexually, but like they get a rush that they're addicted to and I don't, I don't know what it is about people who, who love that, but I don't, I really don't. Maybe I'm a boring person, but I like being comfortable. Well, it's a, it's a weird thing to love, to love, to be scared.

Speaker 4:          00:36:21       You know, you don't want to die. You don't want to get hurt, but you want to be scared. It's a weird thing, but it's really common. I mean, look at roller coasters. The scariest fuck most fucked up things you could do in your life these days or go to some of those like magic mountain rollercoasters yeah. Holy Shit. Those are terrifying. Yeah, it was at one, they have the x something or another. They have a one called the viper and one called the x. The X one. You can't even have anything in your pockets. They strap you to this concoction spins you around all this fucking chaos. And it is so terrifying because you're like, if this thing goes wrong, MYP shit, it's just breaking apart. You're just going to put bodies, you can get ripped to shreds. You're going to get smashed into the gears of this machine is so powerful that it's whipping 200 people simultaneously around, you know, surprisingly roller coasters don't scare me at all.

Speaker 4:          00:37:13       Not even a little bit like I don't mind roller coasters. I just, anything where I am, there's like a free fall involved, I'll get scared. Um, but other than that, I feel like I can handle it. Roller coasters are great. I love roller coasters, but there's always that somewhere in your mind has to recognize that people have died on his fucking pants. It's not very many. It's very few. Yep. Very, very few. Most likely you're going to be fine, but you might not be. I mean, look, you put your life in danger every time you get behind the wheel and you drive. I'm averaging an accident a year at this point. Is this that thing, Jamie, what is it called? Magic Mountain. Oh, good Lord. Justin, when I did this fucking thing. Oh God. They give you all a locker. Okay. This ride so fucked up.

Speaker 4:          00:37:57       You get all locker. You get to put your shit in a locker so you don't have anything in your pockets because anything that's in there, it's just going to fly into someone's eyeball. The top thrilled dragster at Cedar Point I've been on you go to 120 miles an hour, I think in like three seconds and up to 420 feet within six. Fuck the fuck are you saying? And then straight down kind of look at this. It's a roller coaster where you're hanging upside down and spinning around in circles. Oh good Lord. You're just experiencing it from watching it from an outside perspective. If you're sitting in those seats, it's madness. You're fucking up feel when it was over,

Speaker 1:          00:38:36       like usually when the rollercoaster is done, I'm like, my entire body's kind of trembling, but when you're in the moment you don't feel it like it. And I don't mind that feeling. The thing that I don't like is just the anticipation of something that scares me. So like again, jumping out of that plane, like the moment before I jump out of the plane is what scares me the most. Um, but yeah, when I'm in the middle of it, I feel like I can handle it fine.

Speaker 2:          00:39:01       I think a lot of fighters get addicted to that, overcoming that moment and being calm and peaceful in that moment, you know? Because especially like what I did doing taekwondo is not nearly as terrifying is doing MMA because MMA is just, it's just a, it's more likely that someone's going to have an answer to your bullshit. And then it is if you're just doing one discipline, whether it's boxing or something like that, just so many variables, it's really easy to get smashed and it's, it's hard to beat everybody in MMA. It's one of the more difficult sports to become like truly dominant in. Yep. And so when these guys are getting into that cage, like you could see this wrestling match with this anticipation with all this nervous energy and it's a huge part of it for them because when they win, you never seen anybody happier. Yeah. When, when a guy has like a huge victory the UFC and they throw their arms up and they fuck like there's this, there's craziness to it. It's just, you don't, you can't imagine someone being like more excited to win something, you know, like you don't ever like win a game of ping pong and go like, they jump up there, they're just so pumped up that they literally can't control it.

Speaker 1:          00:40:10       That's how I feel at the end of the day when I haven't read a comment asking me to sit on someone's face like, fuck no, I get that kind of, I get that kind of Shit on daily basis. So if I go like one day without reading like a crazy ass comment, I'm like, oh by God it's okay.

Speaker 6:          00:40:26       Good day.

Speaker 2:          00:40:28       Problem is they probably get you condition. So if you want a few months without any of those comments, he'd be like, Hey, come on.

Speaker 6:          00:40:33       Well, every now and it was finished it on their face. What the fuck? Come on every now and again to my boys, I'm not saying cut it out entirely. How rude. Imagine if that was okay.

Speaker 2:          00:40:44       Okay. So you just, you know, once you missed it you like shit.

Speaker 1:          00:40:47       No, but you know, the one thing that I did realize is, I mean in the very beginning of my career, I guess, um, when I, when people wouldn't focus on what I was talking about and then all the comments were about what I look like, I was like, Ugh, God, no one's paying attention to what I'm saying. Then. And I was like kind of heard about it and then I realize like these people are telling me I'm attractive. There are worse things in the world.

Speaker 2:          00:41:08       Yeah. With my life. You got a super lucky roll. The dice. Yeah. Medically. Thank you. That's very sweet. Yeah. Right. So like if they're saying that you're hot, that's fine. Let it, yeah. Yeah. I don't, so I don't mind those comments anymore. But it is, it's a weird thing that men do to dismiss women, right? They'll talk about your looks or your makeup or something like your heels, you know, that's, that's cheap. That's like a cheap tactic. Like if someone's talking about an, and you start talking shit about their makeup, you know, like, oh, like girls in heels and look at her with a little skirt. Yeah. But then again, for the male's point of view, it's very weird that you get to wear skirts.

Speaker 1:          00:41:45       Really. Do you want to wear a skirt? I mean, I wouldn't judge. You

Speaker 2:          00:41:49       don't want to wear a skirt. However, it's very weird that one gender gets to regularly expose their shaved legs and flip them back and forth and interviews. And it's very strange. Yeah, it's very odd that you have the one gender that is more desirable, physically more pursued. If you had a bet like who's pursuing more as women or women pursuing men more or men pursuing women war for sure. Men are pursuing women more so the, the women are more pursued but more exposed in their attire on a regular basis. Like just a tiny piece of cloth separating your vagina from the cold hard world. And that's standard business clothes. Yeah, that's kind of odd, right?

Speaker 1:          00:42:31       I guess. But you know, it's funny because there's, there are, there are different schools of feminism, right? I just said feminism, Europe, viewers just like lost interest and started throwing up anyway. Just stay with me. Stay with me, please. Okay. So there's one school that thinks like if you are a woman, do not flaunt your sexuality. Do not embrace femininity, rejected. Um, because that if you do flaunt it, that's all people are going to focus on. And, but like, I fucking hate that school of thought, right? Because I think femininity is great. And I like embracing the differences between men and women. Men, women are not equal. That doesn't mean that men are better than women or that women are better than men. We're freaking different. Right? Yeah. And so embrace the fact that you have differences, but expect or, or yeah, expect equality when it comes to situations regarding employment and things like that.

Speaker 1:          00:43:23       Right. But yeah, I mean, I'd love to do like, you know, sociological, historical, um, research to figure out why it is that women can dress that way and men don't, whatever it is. But also, I dunno, it's funny because going back to what you said about men pursuing women more, I think that that is changing slowly based on with Tinder. Sure. Okay. So there's that element of his are out there just banging left and right. These crazy kids, there's that element of it. But I also think that as women become more dominant in the workforce, I think you're seeing more and more women feel confident enough to pursue men. At least that's my experience. I

Speaker 2:          00:44:02       think it's insulting to think that a woman can't wear whatever the fuck she wants. Whatever she likes to wear, the way they dress, the way she wants, and still be intelligent. Yeah, that's, that's really like a form of sexism inside of like your own gender. It's like you're, you're separating the idea of like a serious woman. Yup. You know, a serious woman and a woman who wants to look sexy. Well says who says you? Yeah. So it's who, who's the, who's the one who gets to make this call and you know, here's where it gets really weird. The one exception to that as far as like women dressing up and like really like skimpy outfits and looking really sexy and wearing high heels and makeup and really girling up. The one exception is transgender women. Transgender women are always supported as deep as they go into the woman category. Like as deep as they go into the femininity care. You go girl, you go girl. Yeah. Nobody ever says to like a transgender woman, hey, you're dressing like a whore. You know, they give her some slack.

Speaker 1:          00:44:57       I think that the same courtesy should be extended to anyone and, and whatever a woman wants to where I am supportive of it just because like someone might wear something that I wouldn't want to wear myself, but that doesn't mean that I should sit around and like judge them and say, Oh, I'm not going to take this person seriously. So I got to give a quick example because this kind of shows you how progressive's can go too far when it comes to certain things. So I have this friend from Grad School, um, who is like a hardcore progressive, right. And he was co I commented on or I did a status update on Facebook when I recently went to France for a media conference. I didn't know that I had to walk around on the plane or else my legs would get fucking swollen as I've ever seen them.

Speaker 1:          00:45:41       Like they got really swollen, so none of my shoes fit once I finally landed. Um, and so I wrote on Facebook that I had to buy a new pair of shoes that were a size and a half larger than what my feet really are, just so I can wear heels to this conference. And he commented back and he's like, why are you wearing heels and why are you subscribing to the male expectation of femininity and beauty and you're doing a disservice to feminism? And I was like, really? I was like, you're in towards, you find it ironic that you as a dude are now telling me what I should wear as a woman in order to follow the right perspective of femininity or feminism, I should say. So that really made me, made me upset because for me, wearing high heels isn't about attracting men. Sure. There's some part of it in there. But what I actually love about wearing heels is it makes me stand straight. It makes me feel sexy. It makes me feel confident. And I feel like once I put it on a pair of heels, I can rule the world. It has very little to do about attracting males.

Speaker 2:          00:46:39       Yeah. You should be able to wear whatever the fuck you want. If Gene Simmons could wear those boots with the teeth on the bottom of them and still be one of the manliest man ever. I mean, come on. He said we were boots that went all the way up to his knees. Nobody complained. Nobody give us back your man card with your feminine outwit, but the shoes, boy, what's up with the fucking shoes? Disappoint me. No, you know he doesn't have to go on stage at timberlands on some fucking Rodeo belt. Buckle shoes. He's wearing leather pants. Come on. He's got fucking glitter all over his body. It's Marin makeup. He's got makeup on. Yeah. What the fuck where? Whatever you want. Who gives a shit? That's the problem is people were getting genuinely upset about something. That's none of their fucking business. Absolutely, and they're just deciding that because they've met women who have dressed sexy. All women would dress sexy, are idiots, and they do with men. The men who work out in many workout of fucking Meta. Oh,

Speaker 4:          00:47:30       what are you going to the gym, meathead. They'll delve diminish you because you work out. It's the same thing, you know. Go Steve. Nice tight shirt. Yeah it is. A lot of it comes through. Looks good to be honest with you. Of course it is, right? Yeah, of course. I mean if you're a hot dude who's been working out and you're getting criticism from other guys because you're a meathead, you're coming from a jealous place. I liked it. They've invented that dude bro thing. Cause it really is very quickly diminishing. Yeah. Like if someone says anything, yeah, he's the most dude bro Guy ever. Ooh. Wow. That fucking hurts. Actually it works. Cause he ever knows what they're talking about. You know, like a dude bro. It's just like a blur. It's such a great thing to say because he can't even get upset at someone saying it. Cause it's not even like you're a cunt face. You know? It's like he's a dude bro. Like I don't even know what you said. They don't know what that means. So diminishing, but it's so effective. Yeah. Yeah. Well, you know, people are weird. They're weird. We're weird at what we get upset about, you know, me included, I get upset about shit and then I go, why do I care what the fuck is wrong with?

Speaker 1:          00:48:26       Okay, yeah, that happens time to time. I will definitely feel that especially doing what I do. Like sometimes I'll get upset about a story and I'm like, wait, why am I letting this get to me? Yeah. You know, and then sometimes we'll do a story where it'll have this profound effect on me recently. Um, I don't know if you read about George Stinney who was executed in 1944. This 14 year old boy, I heard that he was exonerated recently. He was exonerated recently executed in 1944, um, because he was convicted of killing two white girls. Uh, so he had nothing to do with it, as you guys know, exonerated recently. And um, we were doing the show and our COO Steevo came in and he's like, hey guys, I'm sorry to interrupt the show, but I want to give you a quick update on a story that I find important.

Speaker 1:          00:49:12       And then he gave us the details. I had never heard about George Stinney until that moment. And I don't know what it was. But when he told me about that 14 year old who weighed 90 pounds getting executed for a crime, he didn't commit. I couldn't hold back tears. And for the first time in a really, really long time, I was about to burst into tears on camera and we had to go to break. So I can kind of like, you know, contain myself. Do you not want people to see you grow? Um, I, so I want to be as a woman, it's difficult because you don't want people to immediately go to, oh, she's just an emotional female. She's not a reliable source of news. Right. A lot of people think that if you're passionate about something, that means that you're irrational and that you're just an emotional girl. And so I go out of my way regardless of how, how much I want to like break down. I go out of my way to make sure I don't cry on camera. Cause. And then also whenever you cry on camera, I immediately think of like the Glen Becks of the world who were like super fucking cheesy and they like, they're doing it, they're doing it to ham up the audience. Right.

Speaker 4:          00:50:15       Yeah. I don't think you should ever worry about being fake because you don't give off any of that. So I think if you felt like crying on camera, cry on camera, but if you don't feel like crying on camera, you don't have to do that either. Yeah. That's, it's interesting

Speaker 5:          00:50:28       to wonder why. Like I've never cried on camera either, but I've cried. I've cried it on movies and shit. Yeah. I cry. I have daughters are crazy. I'm a bit

Speaker 1:          00:50:37       aw,

Speaker 5:          00:50:41       I do, I cry. I cry for no fucking reason. Uh, it's, it's pretty easy to like a good song or a good like, you know, especially anything where anything where, you know, people are losing loved ones. So, yeah. I remember I watched this documentary once. It was like a one of these, I'm not a documentary, like a, um, it was a cable show that was documenting Malibu fires and these fires where it's just devastating fires that swept through this hillside, destroyed all these homes. And this one guy who was a fireman and a, he had a house that he worked his whole life to build. And um, he, he built it himself and you know, it didn't make a lot of money, but he saved up enough to buy this piece of land and literally build his own house over the course of several years by himself.

Speaker 5:          00:51:28       And he was living in it and his house was spared, but his neighbors wasn't. And this guy was just weeping, just weeping, weeping for his neighborhood, for, you know, the idea of losing his own house and this whole thing. And, uh, I was watching this in the green room of a show that I was about to do. Oh. And then I had to go on stage is where before I realized you can't do that. Like I'd only been doing comedy a few years. I Wa I was a rookie. And so, uh, I was doing this show with this guy, JB Smoove. I don't know if you know who he is. He was on a curb. Your enthusiasm. Hilarious. Hilarious comedian. And it was supposed to be, JB was supposed to go up first, but then I was supposed to go up second. But JB got lost. It was a college in New Jersey and he was in the middle of nowhere.

Speaker 5:          00:52:14       It was really hard to find. I got there early, but I was, I went, I got, I left way early and just got there early. So they told me to just sit in the green room and watch some TV and relax. No worries. We'll start the show whenever. And so I'm sitting there watching these people cry in this girl calling for her dog. She's calling for a dog, you know, she's like rusty, rusty. That fucking dog is dead. You know, it's dead. And you got a camera on this girl while she's calling for this nonexistent doc. It's a God damn inferno. It looks like Satan came over the mountain with fucking flaming horses. It looks horrible and they're focusing on this girl. There's sucking you in, showing you the humanity of the situation.

Speaker 1:          00:52:55       Oh my God. Crying like a bitch and then I got to go on stage. No, that's tough man. That's tough. It's hard to, you know, gather your thoughts after you see something traumatic like that and it, it really like hits you the first time. I've only cried on camera twice. Okay. So I just mentioned the George Stinney story. That was the recent incident. Um, the first time I ever cried on camera was actually years ago and we did a story about, I think it was a natural disaster that happens somewhere, I don't remember. But um, someone

Speaker 6:          00:53:26       had died and as a result of the natural disaster and he got buried and there was this photo of his dog just sitting and waiting by his grave. And I don't know, like I just like understanding the loyalty of that dog and he's there. He showed that someone didn't tell him to lie down, right? No, no. It was, no, it was a real story. I don't know if the dog had like maybe the family members went to the burial or whatever and the dog route, like realized that I have no idea. But it was, and it was, it was reported by a very credible news organizations. So it wasn't like, oh look, this was posted on reddit and it's real. No, it was like, yeah, well it was like the Associated Press or Reuters or something like that. Um, the problem with those stories as they sound great and so there's no harm in them being bullshit.

Speaker 6:          00:54:16       Yeah. You can just put it out there was a dog and a fucking come around you out. No, the dog's going to be like, Yo, this is bullshit. Do they gave me a bone. They told me the light on there. I don't know where that dude's bird fuck this bullshit stories bullshit. So it's a no risk so they can just make shit up. Well that's true. Yes. And you're right. That's like a harmless made up story if it is made up. But the worst thing is when you have like credible news organizations or like a magazine like rolling stone doing a really, really terrible job with that Uva story. Do you know about that? Yes. That's unfortunate. It's unfortunate

Speaker 5:          00:54:50       because you know, it's very unfortunate when you release a story that has troubles, um, and that these troubles could have been investigated before, especially when it's on a very, very, very sensitive topic that everyone knows needs to be addressed. Everyone, I don't think there's a single person that doesn't believe it's sexual assault isn't a problem. It's a huge problem. You haven't been online. No. Everybody must know. Everybody must know that it's possible. Everybody must know that women can get sexually assaulted, right? So whenever you, you know that that is true, it has happened. It's 100%. It's undeniable. If you have a situation where someone is accusing someone of, covering something up along, it's like you've got to go over that bitch with a fine tooth comb. You can't leave them with any evidence that points because it not only is if, if you, if you fail to make a credible story that can't be backed up, not only does it fail in that attempt, but it strengthened the resolve of the other people that think there's a lot of false rape accusers, 100%

Speaker 6:          00:55:51       I that story did so much damage to those who actually are, and who knows? This Jackie girl might actually be a rape victim, but maybe she can't recall the specific events. I don't know. I don't know what her story is. I have no evidence. I don't even want to comment on that. Right? But regardless, the misreporting and the misinformation that was portrayed in that rolling stone piece does a disservice to the actual rape victims out there who are trying to get people to believe them. But people are denying that they went through something as terrible as rape. And

Speaker 1:          00:56:24       it's funny, I teach a journalism course at cal state Northridge, right? And Journalism Ethics One oh one is that you get both sides of the story. That doesn't mean that you are neutral. You should be objective. Right? But don't be like, oh, this side says this, that side says that now you guys decide I'm against that. Right. But you still have to get both sides of the story and then you as an investigative journalists need to go out there and seek the truth. And that didn't happen with the rolling stone piece. They agreed with Jackie that they would not corroborate her account of the events with anyone else. What kind of fucking journalism is that? That's crazy. I mean that story actually really pissed me off because that did a lot of harm.

Speaker 5:          00:57:04       How do you think that that kind of an agreement gets put into place where someone says, we won't corroborate the facts of the case? Like we won't try to investigate it any further. Like why would someone agree to that? It doesn't really make sense. Right?

Speaker 1:          00:57:17       I think maybe I'm going to give them the benefit of the doubt, but maybe they understood that this is a sensitive story and here is a woman who is a potential rape victim and they want to be very sensitive to her. And so they kind of like walk on egg shells for her. But so that's like the best case scenario for rolling stone if that's what their intentions were. The worst case scenario is if, and I don't know if this is the case, but if you have a journalist who has her own biases and she uses those biases to justify only using one source for her story, I don't know which one of those two scenarios actually occurred, but nonetheless, the outcome was disastrous and it was, I mean that story came out, um, or the aftermath of that story came out when my class was winding down. But if I get the honor of teaching that class again, I'm going to bring up that case and I'm going to be like, do not do this. This is the most irresponsible type of journalism you can do.

Speaker 5:          00:58:19       It's super unfortunate too because it can be avoided. Yeah, it can be avoided with due diligence. And that's the one thing that people complain the most about like web sites. Like they don't really, they're not really under any supervision. Like they could do whatever they want. And you have excellent ones and you have piss poor ones. You have ones that report things that are just totally made up. I can't tell you how many, how many times a week someone sends you something that's, it's not even a parody site, it's just a complete made up site. They were, there was a site where someone was sending me new species of Hominid found and they thought that they found dead leprechauns these, this a dude like he's, he's, he's sweeping. He's usually like a paintbrush to sweep the side of a mountain and there's a little dead leprechaun skeleton. Like, get the fuck out of here, dude. It's really, send me this. You asshole. But that's, you know, that's the internet, you know, and that's beautiful. You can do whatever you want, but you don't expect that from like rolling stone from rolling stone. I expect, you know, it's God damn. That's where hunters Thompson used to, right. You're supposed to have like the highest journalistic ethics ever. You talk about important stories. You have Matt motherfucking [inaudible] the, I was about to mention,

Speaker 4:          00:59:22       I mean, Matt Taibbi is amazing. He's a monster. He's a freaking muck. Yeah, he is. He's the most ever at that. He's the best ever it down. And he's brilliant to read too. It's, it's fun stuff. Like he's, you know, he's a, he's a, he's a fucking, he's a journalistic gangsters. What it really is, it really is. I mean, there are very few journalists out there that I look up to. Matt Taibbi is certainly one of them. And so, so yeah, I mean I think that that rolling stone piece regarding Uva not only did damage to people that have been raped, but it also did damage to their own magazine. It did damage to the other reporters out there who do the due diligence necessary to put out a responsible news report. I don't know. It was disheartening. I did not like that at all. I think people get super scared and sensitive when it's dealing with that subject.

Speaker 4:          01:00:08       The subject of rape. It's such a, you know, a dark subject. So when people are dealing with that, I think, you know, sometimes they, they just, they don't look at things as objectively as they could if they weren't like really locked into this like very kid gloves approach to this one subject mean all subjects were a victim or awful. Whether it's molestation, whether it's violence, whether it's any, you know, anything that happens like person to person, human interactions, it gets fucking sensitive is shit including sexual stuff like rape. It's all like super sensitive. But when you're talking about like a crime in a story, there's this real fear of blaming the victim or this real fear of questioning the victim and the real fear of stepping. I mean, can imagine the horror of being raped and then the horror of someone accusing you of lying about that rate when it actually has happened.

Speaker 4:          01:01:01       So that's, it's very weighted because of that. Rightly so. You know, so everybody that approaches the subject of rape is like very, very kind and sensitive about it. But it seems like in this case it's just a fuck up because you're talking about stuff that wouldn't be that hard to look up. Like you could, you could just, you know, and you don't even have to like do it with that person. You just start doing some work and find out, you know, who was in what fraternity and what, what's social affairs were. I mean they have to like keep logs of shit and Jackie described someone that she knew from years prior that doesn't even go to the school. I mean just simple little details from her story. You can corroborate without, let's say you don't want to talk to anyone who was one of the alleged rapist, right?

Speaker 4:          01:01:43       Cause she was allegedly gang raped. Right. Let's say you want to just check on the little facts like, okay, was there a party thrown by the fraternity on the date that Jackie specified? That's a very simple thing to check out. They didn't do that irresponsible to save the least. It's just crazy that it's rolling stone. That's what's crazy. It's just so it seems that, um, it's also, everybody's like, there's so much content out there. I mean, there's so many different websites. There's so much competition. There's some, I mean, I think people were many, maybe many times in a rush to get salacious stories out because you know, anything that's very

Speaker 5:          01:02:20       prominent and terrifying, like, like, uh, a gang rape, you know, people who have daughters think about, oh my God, [inaudible] gang rape, what he did, why he got away with it. And then there's also the issue of people that experienced trauma that they lose a lot of memory. That's a fact. People, people who've had traumatic experiences, the, the very impactful emotions and fear and, and, and self loathing and all the shit that comes, a traumatic experiences. A lot of times people black things out. Like there's a lot of people who have PTSD for events that have happened in their life and they, you know, really violent events, especially, they just block them out. Like, you know, I've talked to people that don't remember, like big chunks of their life. Yeah. And it's people who've experienced some fucked up shit.

Speaker 1:          01:03:02       Exactly. Which is why it could have happened. What could easily happen, what Jackie mentioned or told a rolling stone could have happened, but again, it's up to rolling stone to do its due diligence and make sure that everything that she is reporting to them. Yeah,

Speaker 5:          01:03:17       it's true. Yeah. There's sauce. There's real issue of people just not being truthful and being crazy. You know, people like to make things up. There are, there are a certain amount of people that for whatever reason, they just will start talking and the words will come out and they're just talking about shit that actually never really happened and they're just making things up and I've met a bunch of them. I'm sure you have to. Of course, it's possible you can do it. You can like lie and get pretty fucking far in life. You can totally sneak through certain gates and climb over certain walls. Make it til you make it. Yeah. There's a lot of people to get away with doing that. So you'd never know when someone's telling a story about anything where it's a, he said, she said story, you really never know until you look deeply into it. What's going on. Whatever small percentage of false rape claims there are. I don't know what the percentage is. Like someone said it's like 2% or something of all uh, rapes, uh, that are, that people like claim are false rape claim. So it's just someone trying to get back into ex boyfriend or someone trying to fuck somebody over. But that's still two out of a hundred. You got to look at those. Yeah. You got to you

Speaker 1:          01:04:25       those numbers aren't reliable. You know, it's really difficult to study something like that. Um, but yeah, I mean

Speaker 5:          01:04:31       that's not victim blaming either. Okay. That's just being rational and logical. Yeah. It's all that is. And that there's this idea that you shouldn't look at things rationally or logical or you could, you shouldn't want facts while still being kind, you know, you can still be kind while you want facts, you know. Look, it's unfortunate. It's very unfortunate when you run into someone who has made up stories cause you're like, Oh you poor bastard, you just as crazy liar person.

Speaker 1:          01:04:54       Yeah. You know what's also really crazy is a over the last two years there there've been a number of stories of like teenage girls who have been raped, right. Drugged and raped at these parties. Right. And then they're rapists will take pictures of them as they're passed out. Naked Neuron. This is, this is amazing. There was a girl named Jadah, this happened to her and we reported on her recently. So rapist took pictures of her as she was passed out and she had her leg bent and like a peculiar position. And then they started like basically circulating that photo among their peers. So all of a sudden a bunch of people started bullying her for getting raped. And so they started like a hashtag called Jadah pose and they started posing in pictures in the way that she was in that photo. And just making fun of it, like put, posting it on Twitter and Facebook and bullying the crap out of her.

Speaker 1:          01:05:46       This happened in Houston and she, what's amazing about this girl, she was 16 when it happened. She was resilient enough to not let it destroy her. And so the mainstream press has a policy and I think it's a pretty good policy of, um, hiding the name or the true identity of a minor who's been sexually assaulted or raped or anything like that. And she came out and she's like, no, I don't want anyone to hide my, my image. I don't want anyone to hide my name. I want to come out and speak out against it. Because a lot of teenagers go through the same thing that I've been going through and they, they commit suicide. Right? And so I think it's important to have a really serious discussion about why kids think that that kind of behavior is okay. Because look in the school district that I went to la USD, we had comprehensive sex ED, right?

Speaker 1:          01:06:33       And in comprehensive sex Ed, they talked about everything including rape and sexual assault and molestation. And those were really uncomfortable conversations to have in middle school and high school. But I felt like my peers had an understanding of how serious situations like that are and how you don't bully someone who's a rape victim. And since this happened in Houston, I'm wondering whether or not they had the exposure to the same type of education that we had. Right. Because if you understand the weight of sexual assault and rape, you wouldn't make fun of or bullied the victim. You see what I'm saying? So I don't know. I don't know. That's just my speculation and it's like a hypothesis that I have, but I'm really curious to look into it cause how vicious is that to make fun of someone who's been raped,

Speaker 5:          01:07:20       children lack perspective, they don't have a lot of experience in life. And there's a lot of what being a child is, which is essentially a reflection of the people that are around you when you're growing up and they're very young, they're, you know, you're talking about kids that are less than 18 years old, right? They all have pathways that have been beaten into their brain by either family or circumstance or being around the knuckleheads they're around. And a lot of times they lack perspective and people are also, they're also terrified and confused and everyone is, I mean every fucking young kid that grows up that is a bully is probably just as scared if not more scared than the people that are bullying. They're all terrified. Of course you're doing a bunch of stupid shit. You know that's like a big part of being a young person in the, the what the real issue is is we shouldn't have young kids alone that much with each other cause they get all lord of the flies. Okay. They're supposed to young should have parental

Speaker 2:          01:08:16       supervision and then when they get into their teenagers, he should still have a lot of real grown ass men around. Yeah. Go Hey fucker. Like settle down. Like stop every, what is it? What are you guys doing? Like yeah. Let me explain to you what's wrong about your behavior from someone who they trust. Like a real woman who is running the class is going to go, everybody sit the fuck down. Like what are you thinking you're going to accomplish with this? What do you, what exactly do you think you're gonna accomplish by running through my fucking classroom? Throwing pencils at each other and pulling hair. You guys are fucking crazy. Sit down. Yeah, and someone who talks to them like that where they go, oh well I respect Mrs. Johnson. She's told us shut the fuck up and sit down. But a teacher can't even say that. It can even speak in the language that the kids use on a regular basis on their own because that's profane and sometimes it's the only way you can get their attention.

Speaker 1:          01:09:03       Dude. That's why I love teaching at a university level because at least you're able to have that type of freedom, right? Like no one's sitting there telling you what type of language you can use

Speaker 2:          01:09:14       or what new swearing your class. I swear my class all the time. Your class is fin to get packed right now? No, I love my class sign up. Is it like when I have to, do I have to take some tests and shit? How do I get in this?

Speaker 1:          01:09:26       No test? I mean, it's a broadcast news class. So I teach them how to put news packages together. We do mock production meetings that are very similar to what you would have in like a real newsroom. It's a fun class. I love it. It's very interactive. Um, but I tell them in the beginning like, look, I'm not much older than you guys. I'm 28, um, I cause I'm going to talk to you as if I'm your peer, but I'm not an easy professor. So don't take advantage of that. Like, I want to have a discussion. I want us to like understand each other. Like I have that whole spiel in the very beginning and I want them to open up, you know, I want them to trust me and I want them to respect me and have like a real conversation with me when I'm actually doing my lectures. Because there's nothing worse than having some monotone old fuddy duddy come in and tell you like, okay, today we're going to talk about journalistic ethics. They're not going to pay attention to that. I've had those professors.

Speaker 2:          01:10:17       Yeah. So we use the word fuddy duddy just knowing what a fuddy duddy is. Yeah, I mean people definitely would rather communicate with somebody who they feel like it's a regular person and you know, university level. Of course you could do that, but with kids like my God, you know like leaving them alone to be mean to each other. These 13 to 14 year olds like Hobo, everybody fucking settled down like, what do you guys, you don't even know what you're doing here. Are you being mean to this little girl? Because somebody drugged her and fucked her. Do you know how crazy that is? Like you girls out of your mind like ticket and also kids get ramped up and rivalries to the point where they want each other dead kid. Like 14 year old kids will fight to the death. Like they literally have this fucking bitch, I want her dead and they fucking get out of school and hit each other with their purses and pull hair and dudes will like, teenage boys are some of the most dangerous people you ever run into because they're physically, they start, they're starting to get their testosterone,

Speaker 4:          01:11:14       they're starting to get strong. They and they've only been doing, they've only been strong for a very short amount of time. Like an 18 year old boy is essentially only been man strong for like two years. So he has this new thing over the lip, sweet 16 and 18 I'm might be able to fuck this dude up, you know, and they have this weird thing about them that they have to manage and if they do that without any guidance, if they do that with any supervision of, they definitely do that without any tests, trials and tribulations. If they just don't ever get to express that violent chimpanzee eco that's ringing around inside our Adams, if they don't express that, they'll, they won't be able to control it. It, it'll spin out into the trees. They don't, they won't know what the fuck they're doing. I mean, this is part of the reason why growing up, my mom never let me go to sleep overs or camp or anything like that.

Speaker 4:          01:11:59       I'm sure like that engage shit. Probably the prevalence of sexual assault. What do you mean gay shit? Girls get together camps. Oh yeah. I waited until I was like in my twenties to get into that kind of stuff. Wow. Bao. Um, but yeah, like I think my mom understood the kind of things that happened when a bunch of teenagers get together and so she was like, nope, you're not going anywhere. Yeah. When I was, I went to boy scout camp and they fucking tied this kid up, but toothpaste all over his clothes, they cheat. They took him, they, they tied him to his, uh, his cot and they carry the cut into the woods and we were in New Hampshire and it was in the middle of fucking nowhere. There was no light outside. Like I'd never been to a place where it was dark out because there was no moon that night.

Speaker 4:          01:12:41       You couldn't fucking see your hand. Oh my God. You're trying to see your hand. You can't see your fucking hand. Like there was no light. None. And they put this to the fucking, they brought them out into the woods and left him there. This guy is screaming soon. Funny guys, this isn't funny. And uh, they woke me up to one of them grabbed me and I jumped up like, fuck you dude. You're not taking me out there. I'm not going to that fucking woods. God, they put toothpaste in your clothes. It's very hard to get toothpaste off your clothes. Is it? Yeah. Yeah. You got to really scrub it. Dutch shit, it doesn't just come off. So you can't just put it in the washing machine and it's gone. Well, you know, we're in the woods to the wash and close with like literally washboards.

Speaker 4:          01:13:19       I know it was a camp. We had archery and shit. There was guns. They give these little fucking psychos guns. I was in the archery range. I heard. I go, what the fuck is that guy goes a ricochet. I go, fucking ricochet just came near us. It's why is someone shooting with somebody probably hit a rock. Probably an accident like foc, little inner city fucking creepers going to boy scout camp. We'll animals, man, this is just making me not want to have kids. I went once, I'm like, I'm good. It was there for two weeks. Oh my God. I miss my parents so bad. Couldn't wait to get home. I was like, how old are you? Such a bitch. Um, I was probably, it was under 14 so it was probably the 13 or 1213 oh fuck. Whose dog? Animals savages and out here going to boy scouts with cause plus, you know, 13 or whatever the hell. I was like, that's fucking young. You know, you're out there

Speaker 5:          01:14:12       in the woods with a bunch of fucking crazy dudes. You don't even know. Like, Oh yeah, yeah, that's not good. And this older kids too, like some of the kids were like 15 1617 and a 17 year old kid and a 14 year old kids should never be unsupervised. Yeah. Especially the 17 year old kids at creep because they'll just decide that the 14 year old has to do shit, you know, and then force him to do it and beat their ass. It's like, because finally they get to tell other people what to do. Like for 17 years their parents are probably been telling them what to do and if they grow up in an abusive household, you know like salt. So many bullies that I met when I was a kid. It turned out like when you went to their house you realize, oh, this guy gets bullied at home and then he goes and bullies people at school.

Speaker 6:          01:14:55       Yeah, of course. I think, I think parenting has a lot to do with it. The way that people are raised has a lot to do with it.

Speaker 5:          01:15:00       I had a friend, these are getting in fist fights with his dad, fist fights and he would, this fucking guy, I won't say his name because he's a good dude. He's not a bad guy. I grew up with him and he would fight anybody. Me and my friend Jimmy would go with this guy and we would have, he goes, that's it. We're fighting tonight. And I'm like, we're fighting tonight because we're fucking fighting. And he would just find some money, like come on mother fucker and there's fine the guy and start a fight with them. And I've never met anybody like this. This guy just would just literally for no reason go find a person to go. Come on, motherfucker were fighting and he would talk about it. Like he had a good one too. He had a good left, right? That was like his, he's wasn't really a very good fighter who's half decent.

Speaker 5:          01:15:38       So it wasn't like he was even winning these fights. Like a lot of times he'd get in fights and get his ass kicked. But he had, he had a pretty decent one too, but this fucking guy would just start fights for it. And then I went to his house and then I got, became friends with them. He was friends with my friend Steve. And when I became friends we hung around and I realize like, oh, this guy got fucking abused. Like he got beat up all the time like he was, he would get in like fist fights with his dad when he was young, you know, like young, you know [inaudible] his dad would punch him, you know, it was like scary shit. So when you, when you meet like the monster behind the curtain and you go, oh, this isn't so cute anymore. Isn't it so funny?

Speaker 5:          01:16:19       Now I know why this guy is doing this. He's, he's an asshole because he's getting bullied. Because like when I became friends with like, we never had a fight. We never even had an argument. We were really friendly with each other and for whatever reason it was like he just would find people that he wanted to fight and it was just an, I couldn't understand it. I was like, why would anybody want to do that? Until I realized like, oh, this dude is like fighting his dad all the time. He's probably fighting his dad every day. Damn. Okay.

Speaker 6:          01:16:41       Yes. That's some crazy shit. Shit. Roll the dice is what it is really is. I mean, I think about every once in a while I get kind of down about certain things like, ah, am I fulfilled at work? Am I happy? Like, oh, I could be doing better, not, and then I think about it,

Speaker 5:          01:16:56       people problem

Speaker 6:          01:16:58       100%. Right? Like I've been giving, I haven't been giving Christian a hard time, but like every once in a while I'll come home and I'm like in a bad mood and he's like, what's wrong? And, uh, my, my problems, such bullshit problems,

Speaker 1:          01:17:10       you know what I mean? I have great parents. I was able to get a good education with no debt. Like, I have a job that I love. Like I have friends that I love. Everything's great. So like when I tried to put things in perspective and stories like that really do put things in perspective for me, people who don't have like a home to go to, people who don't have good parents, like there's a lot of pain and suffering out there. You know, I remember, um, I don't think I told you about this, but, um, we had gone to San Diego and I tried, um, mushrooms and for the first time and uh, it's like a good, it's a good way of kind of like putting things into perspective, right? Because I felt euphoric. Everything was great. I had a really, really good experience with it.

Speaker 1:          01:17:55       But there was one point when we were like walking down the street and there was this one elderly homeless man just walking and he's like stumbling, like he can barely walk. Right. And like, that hit me really hard. Like this man has such a bad life. Like he's out on the streets, he's elderly, he's older than my dad, you know, and I think about my dad and he's like getting up there and like, you know, I, his body's kind of starting to break down a little bit and I'm like, man, this guy, I mean, he has no family. He has no one looking out for him. He's out here on the streets and like, I don't know, like it really, really hit me and it put everything in my life in perspective. Like how freaking lucky I am.

Speaker 5:          01:18:34       Yeah. It's interesting that, isn't it funny, it's, it's kind of says something about people that it's very in very poor taste to make fun of poor people unless they're so poor they don't have a home and then they're open targets. Yeah. You know what I'm saying? Like as far as the way people mock people, like people will mock homeless people. Like it's a really common thing to talk about homeless people on stage, but if you talk to yeah, yeah, yeah. Jokes about homeless people are very common cause homeless people are a lot of times are crazy. You know, it's not their fault. Like one of the reasons why a lot of these people are homeless because they have mental illness and there are undiagnosed or they don't have money for prescriptions or they lost their job and they,

Speaker 1:          01:19:12       sometimes they are diagnosed. But like if you're a paranoid schizophrenia, like my friends, a social worker and she has this one client, he's this really young, attractive guy in his twenties. Right. And he recently got diagnosed as a paranoid schizophrenia and he is in such denial about his condition that he will not get any help. Wow. And now he's homeless. He's living in a car. Um, it's a devastating story and it's like he has the reasons family has the resources to help him. He doesn't want the help. So what do you do with situations like that? He's out on the street.

Speaker 5:          01:19:43       There's not much you can do. And that's the reality of mental illness. And that's, it's, it's a weird thing where like you can't make fun. No one would make fun of really poor people, like how they're poor. But you know, you could build like, cause fucking idiot sleeps under a tree, you know, what do you your sleeping bag and the fucking park, you'd dip shit. You don't even have a house really. Like it could be a point of mockery. Like people would walk them and even

Speaker 6:          01:20:08       tell him to fuck off. Whereas like you would never do that in a poor neighborhood. It's kind of strange. It's like if you reach poverty to the point of where you don't even have a roof over your head, you're fair game. It's weird, right? Yeah. We have our own way of demonizing poor neighborhoods though we demonize them by allowing police brutality in those areas and justifying it by saying, well it's a poor area with a lot of crime so of course the cop can shoot an unarmed person and not paying the consequences for you. What is your take, and I was really interested to talk to you about this on first of all on the amount of police brutality cases that are happening. Is it just because people were reporting them now is because people were recording them now or am I just, am I just really like only paying attention to what gets broadcast in the same things were always happening.

Speaker 6:          01:20:52       I think that this is probably something that's been going on for quite some time, but now since we have access to surveillance, since people are using their smart phones, since communities are starting to like really be on edge in regard to the excessive force, now we're seeing a lot more coverage about it. And I think that there's, there's now a tipping point, and I don't know if it's going to lead to a new civil rights movement or what the outcome will be, but regardless of what you think about Michael Brown or Trayvon Martin or any of these other high profile cases, I think it's hard to believe that anyone would watch a video of Eric Garner in New York City pleading with the cops who have put him in a headlock to let him go because he can't breathe. Right. And then the cop who kills him doesn't have to deal any concept or deal with any consequences for killing him after putting him in an unlawful headlock. It's against the law as a cop in New York to put someone in a headlock like that. But it didn't matter. He did it. Eric Gardner dies

Speaker 1:          01:21:55       and I don't know. Every time I watched that video, I'm like, God, just let them go. Let them go. You know the outcome, but you keep telling yourself, let them go. Let them go. Come on. He can't breathe. He's telling you he can't breathe, but they didn't fucking let him go and he's dead. How is that? Okay. How has that kind of excessive force? Okay, and if that's not enough to convince you, keep in mind that the cops harassing him because he was selling untaxed cigarettes, loose cigarettes. Are you fucking kidding me? You're in New York. We're talking about Wall Street, robbing the American people, destroying the economy, never paying any fucking consequences for it, and now you're going to go after this man because he's selling loose

Speaker 6:          01:22:30       cigarettes. It's ridiculous. That case was really disturbing to me because I didn't have any cigarettes on him. He didn't have anything on him.

Speaker 1:          01:22:39       No, no. He broke. He broke up a fight. Cops were called because he fucking broke up a fight. It's like that story enrages me. It really does. Because even with all of that evidence of the police wrongdoing, grand jury verdict says not, we're not going to indict the cop. And then you have people that defend that grand jury verdict. How do you watch that video and defendant? Did you actually watch the video? Did you look into the story or did you just decide, oh yeah, it's a poor black guy. You know, black guys are always trouble, so fuck it, he died. Who Cares?

Speaker 5:          01:23:07       Well, people have this real problem when it comes to issues like this where they either go all the way to the right or they go all the way to the left. Yeah. And you know the, the reality of that situation is that there was no evidence this guy didn't do anything wrong. He was standing there had he been arrested before. Yeah, but so what, what are you saying that because the guy's been arrested before, you're allowed to just fuck with him forever. And if he's selling loose cigarettes, that's it. That's what you're worried about. Like you're not talking about a guy who's selling slaves or a guy who's stealing cars. You're talking about a guy who's just avoiding a cigarette tax. I mean, it's so bizarre. It's so bizarre. The amount of money you're talking about is so goddamn minuscule and unimportant in the city of fucking trillions of dollars are flowing in and out of it daily and you're getting this kind of headlock. He was no lazy

Speaker 1:          01:23:53       for 50 cents a piece or something like something. So I mean, yeah,

Speaker 5:          01:23:57       but when they started grabbing him, like they didn't need to grab him. He wasn't doing anything. He wasn't going anywhere. It wasn't running away. Nope. They're just grabbing him. And when he was saying like this, this ends today, look, y'all always fucking with me. This ends today. And you're like, he just looked and I was like, this is so pointless. Like shouldn't cop should be worried about the most important shit first. Did you solve all the murders? Did you find all the stolen cars? Do you, did you solve all the burglaries? Okay, let's stop fucking with the cigarette dude. And let's just think about that shit. Like there's only how many people that are cops. Yeah. What's the number? This has gotta be more crimes and cops. It's the only thing that makes sense. So why the fuck would you concentrate on this shit? There's like how many of you guys, four or five, you know, I know they came because of a fight, you know, but what do you think? They just wanted an extra color because they got there and decided to arrest this guy.

Speaker 1:          01:24:43       I don't know it, that was one of the more disturbing stories that we covered because the case like Trayvon Martin, you know, you don't have surveillance. A case like Michael Brown, you don't have video. So it's, I can understand even though I don't agree with them, I can understand the doubters, right? But with a case like Eric Garner, the proof is in the pudding. It's right in front of you. You have the video footage and still there were no consequences for the cops. And so, you know, when you have police departments and police unions criticizing NFL players for protesting some of these grand jury verdicts or protesting some of the actions of these police officers, I mean you gotta wonder like what planet they're on. Like you guys got away with murder. Okay, let it go. If people want to protest it, let it go. The worst thing you can do is win and then go out of your way and tell people that you're offended because they're upset that you won.

Speaker 5:          01:25:37       Yeah. What do you, what do you know the law in terms of what kind of uh, like the way you're allowed to grab someone's neck? Like,

Speaker 1:          01:25:44       no, I don't know specifically, but I know that that head lock was unlawful, which is why I don't understand why there wasn't a grand jury verdict

Speaker 5:          01:25:50       because here's the reality. What he's doing definitely is a choke hold. It was hands are together and his hands are together in some of the pictures and some of the pictures he's doing this where his hands are together. Technically it's still a choke hold if you're using one hand, but there's not nearly the same amount of leverage as when you're using two hands. We use to like, this is the real, like what they call a rear naked choke. That's what puts you to sleep really quickly, but you could still put a guy asleep like this. You could put a guy to sleep with a lot of different ways to grab your hands once you're grabbing your hands. So if he's grabbing his hands, it's a choke hold. But even if it's a choke hold, he might not necessarily be choking him. He might be just holding up and you're the only one who knows.

Speaker 5:          01:26:32       That really is that guy, the guy who did it because either he or people who are watching because you either see him really squeezing down the neck or he's holding on. He's got the head in here and he's trapping it, but he's not putting any pressure on the neck. Both of them are possible, but the breathing thing most likely had to do with this guy being diabetic and have a lot of health issues. You know the choking thing, you know you, you, you can cut a guy's ear off, you know when you're choking him. And it is possible because he had his arm around his neck that was happening. But it also could have been possible. The guy was just freaking the fuck out and these guys were on top of him and he's having a heart attack. And either way it was caused by these guys fucking with him. So even if their intention was not to choke this guy out, even if they grabbed him by the neck, what you did kill the guy like for no fucking real,

Speaker 6:          01:27:20       here's what you should do when someone tells you I can't breathe, let off him get off.

Speaker 5:          01:27:25       But you can't do that with Psychos, right? No, you can't let psychos play you say if you, if you're, if you're a cop in New York City and you've got some guy who's like, uh, you know some football player that's running a muck and you, you handcuff him, you're finally drag them to the rouser who can't breathe, can't Gabby, you let him up. But he fucking head butts you and runs through the casino. You know what I mean? Like that can happen. Like you can't really listen to everybody. This is a camp,

Speaker 6:          01:27:46       right? But look, I have no doubt in my mind that the cops in that incident knew that Eric Garner is not a psycho. Okay. I think that they, that's why they're willing to engage with them physically, even though he's a big giant dude. They knew he was a teddy bear. I don't know what I'm saying. Like they knew they got away with it. Did you notice in the beginning of the video, the cop who put him in the choke hold, like waited for backup before he attacked Eric Gardner? So it was like he had it in the back of his mind like, yeah, I'm gonna, I'm gonna do what I'm going to do. I'm just going to make weight and make sure that I have backup for it. It's just such a sick video. I mean, for all the listeners who haven't seen it, please, please take a look at it because make

Speaker 5:          01:28:22       any sense. Because I think that there's a lot of people that join the police force that have great intentions. And I think that when, when when you get into situations where people have what is really pretty basically ultimate power over other people, it becomes fucking tricky as hell. Cause people like to abuse power. They do, they get into that sort of a position and they just take advantage of it and they do things that they can justify but aren't morally right. And this is one of them. It's like this is not serving or protecting. What are you guys, the body guard of the tax collectors is, that's what the fuck you're doing. Are we professional leg breakers who are paid for by the citizens of the United States? No, you guys are cops. You know, in the best of the word, you're loyal

Speaker 6:          01:29:02       and fantastic and a great asset to the community and a very important aspect of the community when it comes to keeping peace and PR, you know, and promoting uh, like a, a sense of, of protection. You know, I have to say though is don't you find it a little ironic that the NYP d, the same police force that killed Eric Garner for selling untaxed cigarettes was also the same Nyp d that went after occupy protesters that were protesting against what Wall Street did to our economy. How many people were there though? How many, how many, like how many people were involved in the occupy Wall Street thing? Did they just send the cops out there and just have them start arresting kids work? What I found really interesting is JP Morgan Chase had donated a huge amount of money, millions of dollars to the NYP d as The occupy protest started to get really fired up.

Speaker 6:          01:29:56       And so look, money talks, right? Wall Street bankers and the people that did what they did to our economy in 2008 have money and power. And so if you have 4.6 million, if you have blatant, you have that kind of money, then you by the police force, they're going to look out for you. Okay, so when do cops really care about taxes? They care about taxes. When the powerless aren't paying their taxes. How rude is that though? 4.6 million. That is so goddamn blatant. I mean it is. I remember, I remember what had happened. I was like, really? You guys are so transparent. I mean I got to respect the fact that you guys are that transparent about it. Right? I respect that. That's gangster as fuck. Just laid out a four point $6 million cheque. Listen, I would like to build my bends into the garage and peace.

Speaker 6:          01:30:43       You got a big fat cigar was talking to, I think we could work something out and you guys need new helmets or some shit. It's the world we live in, man. Four point $6 million is like, that's like saying, you know, look, we have so much fucking money that these hippies, I'm willing to pay 4.6 million just cleaned this bitch up and they did. Is it done? There's a, if you go by there, is there anybody was the square? Do you know what the square was where it was Connie, that's what it is. Is there anybody there anymore? I don't know if there are occupy protesters there now, but I mean, I think it's safe to say at this point that the occupy movement has died down considerably. So, which sucks because I mean, I was very supportive of it. I was behind it. I really wanted to keep it alive at the same time that the banks were doing what they could to shut it down. You also had the mainstream media, which is bought by corporations also doing its best to discredit it, be little it. And so you have like people watching the news thinking, oh, CNN and Fox News like this is, you know, this is a reliable news source thinking that these occupy protestors or all these crazy druggies that are living on the streets and they're causing riots and there looting and this, and I mean kind of similar to what happened with Ferguson protesters, all of them were painted

Speaker 1:          01:32:00       as looters in the mainstream press. Within. The reality is you have a few crazy people that might coopt something, right? That might cause some trouble, but that's not indicative of all the protesters. You know? That's not something that you're going to see with all of them. It's just like a tiny fringe that might be causing some trouble. But it's interesting that the mainstream press, we'll focus on those as opposed to the people who actually have an important message that they're trying to get out.

Speaker 5:          01:32:26       I think they just focus on what they think people are gonna Watch who you're going to watch. This is the blog and off the highway, which is by the way you, you, you guys who are protesting the police, I get what you're doing. It's very noble. There's a lot of like a lot of people with a lot of really good ideas and a lot of really positive energy and they, they, they really want to make some change. But I just think there's a lot of real problems and parking off the highway and one of them is medical care. People that are sick or people that are injured for loved ones to lose loved ones because the highways are blocked off in the ambulance couldn't get through. It would be so horrific and tragic compounding and already horrific and tragic situation. And I don't think it's necessary.

Speaker 5:          01:33:09       I think there's gotta be a way where you can allow traffic where regular folks who probably most of them agree that police violence is out of hand. The you shouldn't be just blocking off highways because you can run into situations where you cost people their lives and you cost loved ones. Loved ones are in horrific grief because this person didn't get to the doctor and time and bled out because the fucking highway was completely shut down because some white kids wanting to show how down they were. They weren't a get arrested and put zip ties on me, bitch. I'm going to fucking snapchat this. I'm going to Instagram these pictures from the back of this patty wagon. I'm so down, I'm so down. We're going to block off the highway. Fuck capitalism. You know there's a lot of like strong wills and good intentions and people that really want the world to be better than it is today.

Speaker 5:          01:34:02       That's the motivation behind it all, but it is very prob problematic when you do things like stop fellow citizens from getting places and using traffic systems and using that just gets weird man. You don't know what you're, you're fucking up and if you did, you would fucking hate yourself. You can't and you can't blame it on anybody else. You can't blame it on the cops. You can't blame it on Ferguson. You can't blame it on the president. If you are blocking the highway and someone dies because of that, you have to blame yourself. You don't need it in your life. There's other ways to protest.

Speaker 1:          01:34:37       Yeah. No, I agree with you about blocking roadways, but there also is a very delicate balance because the reality is protests and political activism is not meant to be convenient and when it is convenient, then you don't get heard. So sometimes you do have to stir the pot. Sometimes there needs to be civil disobedience. Right. Uli,

Speaker 5:          01:34:56       do you think there's a to do it without blocking

Speaker 1:          01:34:58       the highway or definitely. I'm sure. I'm sure there is. I think it's about white hat

Speaker 5:          01:35:01       though. What about the city hall? Sorry to interrupt you, but what about their city hall? Why don't they just swarm that? I'm sure. I'm sure that they did.

Speaker 1:          01:35:07       I'm sure that they did, but I don't, I don't know if that's enough. Really. Um, look, nothing bothers people in authority more than having protesters that are causing a Ruckus. And by rock is, I don't mean breaking into innocent businesses and looting and doing crazy shit like that, but there needs to be civil disobedience right. At a protest, like the way that protests are supposed to go down legally as ridiculous. Like you got to get the right permits for it and you gotta be in the protest zone and you, but like the Burritos, like yeah, let's, let's put all the protesters in a corner and ignore them as they're holding their signs. No, protests are supposed to be inconvenient. They're supposed to get people's attention. It's supposed to fire people up.

Speaker 5:          01:35:49       What about this idea? What about going to city hall and having so many people show up that you block the entrances to all the buildings? I mean, I'm don't let anybody in you just say, look to you guys are broken. This thing's broken. We're not letting you in. Get the fuck out of here. It's everybody locks. And so if you want to get arrested for blocking the highway, how about you blocked the real issue, the real problem, the real, the real source of government. And if you did that, I might be like terrorist act of suggesting this I should probably say is don't do this. I mean, everything's considered, it's whatever I'm saying. Don't listen. I know I'm the fear factor host. I'm not to be taken seriously. Don't do that. Don't block city hall but, but don't block the fucking highway. What? I mean, there's gotta be a way.

Speaker 1:          01:36:32       Sure there is. And I'm not, you know, I'm not good at organizing these types of events, but, but I think you do make a really good point about blocking roadways and things like that. There was a question I wanted to ask you though. I'm really curious if you've ever had to deal with any type of police brutality as a dude.

Speaker 5:          01:36:49       No. No. Fortunately, no. I've seen it. I've seen cops beat the fuck out of people. Really? Yeah, yeah, I've seen. But you know, a lot of times it's drunk assholes and the cops are, you know, having to protect themselves. I've seen that too. You know, I've, I've known a lot of police officers over the course of my life because my, uh, dad was a cop and then, uh, growing up doing martial arts, I knew a lot of dudes that were cops. Like from the time I was 14, 15 years old, I was around cops all the time. And so, um, I'm just, um, you know, they, for the most part, I don't look dangerous. I don't look like a suspect. And now to this day, now it's easy because most of them are UFC fans. Like cops want to learn how to defend themselves, right? So I usually just talk to them and everything's cool.

Speaker 5:          01:37:33       I'm respectful. But when I was a kid, I wasn't the one that you'd worry about. Not a big black guy, you know, I'm a little white guy, so it's like, if I was polite, no sir, give him my license. Registration. I never had a problem. But people you know, in the worst situation can react in the worst way. And that includes cops. I mean, who, you don't know what the fuck that cop had to do before he got to you that day. He could have been in some sort of crazy situation where someone's trying to run him over with a car and he pulls out a meth head off an old lady or just ultimate chaos. He could've gone to a domestic violence situation where you saw somebody get shot, you know, by the time a cop gets to you, who the fuck knows what he saw right before you or just in the years before you. Yeah. So they could be really high strung and yeah. You know, and I, I, I think that some people don't recognize that. And I also think that the idea of being a cop is probably ridiculous and almost no one's qualified to do it for a long time. Cause I think the amount of stress that they see or they experienced in the amount of violence that they see is almost, you know, it's, it's in a lot of ways it's, it's crazy than being a soldier because some of these guys are putting in 25 years,

Speaker 1:          01:38:43       I can't imagine it. I really can't. Some of them are seeing all kinds of crazy shit for year after year after year. It's like that becomes their reality. It changes like who they are. I've never, I mean I've never seen a dead body in my life, but cops see that kind of stuff on a regular basis. So I don't want to discredit cops out there that are doing good work and I know they exist. But I think it's also important for them to speak out against the police brutality that they see. I think a lot of the reason why people are kind of opposed to police in general is because the good cops are usually very reluctant to speak out against the bad cops and they protect one another. And so I think it's important for the good cops to speak out against them because the bad cops are the ones that are really, you know, muddying the waters and um, tainting the entire police force. You're right.

Speaker 5:          01:39:29       And I think there's a really accurate representation of what a bad cop really is when you just look at it. Don Imus posters on the Internet. I think that, and you get a number of people, I don't know how many cops there are that are professional police officers today in the United States of America, but just whatever that number is, if 2% of them are fucking douchebags, which is really likely when you take a hundred regular people just a hundred, the odds of you having to is pretty good. It's probably 70, 80%. The odds of you having one douche bag out of a hundred people's a 100% so it's at least 1% douche bag and every hundred unless you're in like boulder or something where sue people are just super sweet. Unless you're in some weird place, you're going to have like one out of a hundred people that are douche bags. That's going to be the case with police officers as well.

Speaker 5:          01:40:16       So if you look at Internet comments like especially like how many people tell you to sit on their face and shit like that. Look at all the assholes that are out there, but then compare it to the amount of people that are out there. They're dealing with some insanely incomprehensible number of people that are online right now. So for hundreds of millions just in this country, just throwing information back and forth in the shitty stuff gets through the net and it hits you and you're like, people fucking suck. No, most people are awesome. The vast majority of people are great. The vast majority, but it's just like one or 2% that sneak through that fuck the whole thing

Speaker 4:          01:40:54       sideways. Yeah, definitely. There's no question about, that happens with cops too. I think cops are representative of the general public as a whole. And if you, if you looked at only the shitty web comments and ignored all the people that are like posting Facebook posts on each others walls, you look so awesome. I'm so psyched for you. You guys this shit. I love you to death. All that positive shit that people do back and forth with each other that that's like, that counts too. And we don't focus on that. Where it was focusing on these assholes opened litter too. You know, these is shit hoods, right? The angry things and you fucking good for the season. Huh? You know this asshole's calls, you're always going to have assholes. When I think about like my Instagram page for instance, right? Like I get a lot of love on Instagram.

Speaker 4:          01:41:39       Like I very rarely we'll get like a terrible comment on there and, and I've, I love people who follow me on Instagram. They're super sweet, super nice, really respectful. Every once in a while I'll have to block someone, but it's not, it's very rare. Um, so yeah, I think I should focus on that as opposed to like the crazy ass people that write terrible things on youtube, which just the sheer numbers, it's like true. We get caught up in a few variables, a few people that get that sneak through the net. And I think with cops for we, we, we've already established it's an insanely difficult job. It's really hard for people to process all the stress. It's not something the average person experiences. And it's also therefore not something the average person can commiserate with or understand or even conceptualize. If you're not seeing people shot all the time, like you've never seen a body and you're talking to a guy who works in the fucking gang unit like Jesus Christ, you know, you're, you're dealing with two completely different realities.

Speaker 4:          01:42:35       And I think there's that. And then there's also the 2% thing, like you get a hundred people, you know, there's more than a hundred cops. One of them's a con. All right, he's just, he's an asshole. There's no, it doesn't mean that all cops aren't like that. And the other problem is when you're around cons and you've got this fucking code of silence and you know, even if it's one con out of a hundred, if he's got away with some shit, you want to get away with some shit too. They were all brotherhood and the fucking badge and that's where bad cops come from. That's where all that, there's a lot of them have good intentions when they get involved and then they slowly but surely get corrupted. I think it's a culture problem within police enforcement and it needs to be addressed. And one way that you can address it is ensuring that prosecutors and district attorneys and other people that are in the justice system aren't in bed with cops. So when they do do something wrong, you know, there are proper consequences, you know, in response to what they've done. Um, but it's interesting because I never thought for a million years that I would ever experience like a bad cop, you know, cause I'm not the demographic that usually deals with crooked cops. Right? I'm, you know, white girl, you know, who is driving a nice car and I am very agreeable, very nice with cops. Whenever they pull me over. I think you're a white crow, but if you were trying to date some

Speaker 2:          01:43:52       dude who's a white dude in Wisconsin and you can't

Speaker 1:          01:43:55       Armenia. Interesting. That's true. That's true. Yeah. I'm not, yeah, I'm not late earlier white girl. You're in some weird category. Um, but it was funny like a few weeks ago. Really.

Speaker 2:          01:44:09       I mean, it's not a bad thing. I love Armenians. Armenians are firing people. I love our Armenian fighters are some of the most exciting fighters to watch. Yeah, super aggressive. I don't believe it. Breezy and Manny ganbare and some of the most fun guys to watch animals. Yeah, they really are toward Moosejaw and other Armenian. There's a lot of top fighters that Armenian. I didn't know that. Oh yeah. Okay. A good percentage. Yeah. That's good to know. Animal. Yeah. Is quite a few of them. Quite a few of them because they're known for kickboxers too. A lot of good Armenian kickboxers. That's cool. I like that

Speaker 1:          01:44:38       to an Armenian sweet 16 right after this. So I'm looking forward to that. We're going to eat it. Don't do any sparring food. Don't, I won't, I won't, I won't just can throw, I won't mess with them. Um, but yeah, like I got pulled over by a cop a few weeks ago because I did something wrong. I made an illegal uturn and I knew like, I remember right before I did it, I had two of my colleagues in the, in the car with me right before no, three of them right before I did it, I looked around and I was like, is there a cop? Is there a cop? Nope, I'm going to do it. So I start doing the u turn and a cop turns the corner and I was like, dammit, okay, whatever. I'm going to get a ticket. It's fine. I deserve it. Right. And I'm not combative or anything pulls me over before he says, do you know why I pulled you over?

Speaker 1:          01:45:22       Right. Which is what they usually say when they, I believe me, I've gotten a lot of tickets. First thing he says to me is, why are you laughing? And I wasn't, I wasn't laughing. I'm about to get a ticket, right? And I don't want to get a ticket. I just tinted my windows illegally. I'm probably gonna get a ticket for that on the Internet. Everything's gonna be fine. Um, and so I'm, I'm not laughing, right? And so I look at him, I'm like, I'm sorry officer. I'm not laughing. If it seems as though I have like any type of amuse look on my face, it might be because I just did something really stupid and I can't believe I did something stupid. And I really apologize. He's like, I can give you four tickets right now. I'm gonna give you four tickets. And I was like, okay.

Speaker 1:          01:46:05       He's like, yeah. He's like, yeah. He's like, do you deserve for tickets? And I was like, um, if I'm, if I did four things wrong, then I guess I deserve for tickets. I was just being so agreeable with him. Right. I'm like, I'm sorry officer. I apologize him like 50,000 times. And then, you know, he just like stood there and yelled at me and then finally, oh, and then it wasn't, you know, I had just gotten the car so I hadn't gotten my license plates yet. And he's like, where are your license plates? And I was like, it's a new car I, I haven't gotten before I could even finish the sentence. It's like, I don't care. Like he was just really mean. And I was like, Oh, do this guys. Like roid it up. I don't know what his issue is. He's pissed. Right.

Speaker 1:          01:46:43       But I'm just going to keep agreeing with him and let it go. The story gets better. That's just the beginning. So then he goes back to his car and gets his little citation booklet thing and he, I don't know what he looks up, maybe he looks up my identity or whatever. And then all of a sudden I hear him say something and I couldn't hear him because it's kind of a busy road. And so I look at my, my coworkers and I'm like, did he say something to me? They're like, we don't know. We didn't hear him right and they were like spooked out because this guy was being such a dick. And then he said something again and I still couldn't hear him. So I like poked my head out the window and I was like, I'm sorry officer, I couldn't hear you. Can you please repeat that?

Speaker 1:          01:47:21       And then he was like, I need you to step out of the vehicle. And I don't know what it was about him saying that, but I immediately freaked out. Okay. And so like I start tearing up and I'm trying to hold it back and I'm like, why does he want me to get out of the cars? He going to search it. There was nothing in the car, but I'm like, I did search a car. I know have some sort of a warrant. And also he needs probable cause to have me to have me step out of the car. There was no reason for him to have me step out of the car. That alone was not a lawful requests. But anyway, I stepped out of the car, I went by him. And then I realized very quickly that this cup is a fucking pervert. Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:48:00       And so as I'm crying, he's getting a rise out of this and he starts asking me like a bunch of questions, like, why were you using your phone when you were driving? And I was like, my phone was in my purse and my purse was in the backseat. I wasn't using the phone. He's like, how often do you use the phone when you're driving? I was like, never. And, and I was like, I would never do that. I know that I made the u turn, I deserve the u turn ticket, please give it to me and I'm, I'm going to go to, it's like, where were you going? And I was like, I was just trying to go back to work. And he's like, he was like, when was the last time you deserved a ticket? And I was like, what the fuck? Where's this guy going with this?

Speaker 1:          01:48:36       Right. And then finally he was like, where do you work? And I was very close to work, so I pointed down the street where our offices are. And then he was like, he was like, what do you do for work? Oh No. Yeah. He's like, what do you do for work? And I was like, oh, I'm a reporter. Right. I don't want to get into the details. Like I'm actually an internet commentators. Like what? I just said reporter. And then he was like, he's like, oh, there's a newspaper company down the street. He was like an older cop, I don't know. And I was like, no, I work for a show called the young Turks. It's an online new show. It's the largest online news show in the world. You had to tell him is the largest fucking stats.

Speaker 1:          01:49:12       I mean, got to keep it real. He's got to know what he's, you know, and then he asks me, what are you going to report on this little incident today? Oh God. And then I was like, nothing. I don't report on my personal life. And then he slowly closes aside citation book and he's, and then he says, are you upset or no? He's like, are you disappointed? He use the word disappointed. Are you disappointed that I'm letting you off with a warning? And I didn't know what to say. Like, do I tell him yes because I deserve a ticket, please give me a ticket officer, or do I tell him no, I'm not disappointed. I'm actually fucking stoked because I don't want to pay hundreds of dollars for this ticket. So at first I didn't say anything at all. I'm just standing there looking pathetic and I'm crying.

Speaker 1:          01:49:55       I'm literally crying at this point. Right. And then he was like, did you hear me? He's like, are you disappointed that I'm letting you off with a warning? And I was like, no, I'm not disappointed. And then he's like, I hope you have a better day. And then that was it. It was the creepiest interaction I've had with a cop. Do you think you crazy? Um, no. I used to, but I don't think I crazy anymore, but, and I wasn't crying until he told me to step out of the car. That's a weird request. Yeah, that's a, that's a power move for sure. Yeah. Not a threat. He didn't do anything dangerous. You're not. I was the most criminal activity. I told him I deserve the ticket. I gave him my license, my registration, I did nothing wrong. There was no reason for him to have me step out of the car. None.

Speaker 2:          01:50:40       That's the power trip part that everybody hates about cops. Yeah, there's you, you will run into people like that every now and again.

Speaker 1:          01:50:47       You know, they have so much power and in that moment you feel so defenseless. Right? So you, for someone like me who like I hate admitting this about myself, but sometimes in cases like that I will cave into authority. Right? I like to question authority, but in a situation like that, I'm not questioning authority. I'm doing exactly what he wants me to do. I'm doing, I feel powerless. Right. So now that I think about it, in retrospect, I get angry because I wish I would've handled it differently. I wish I would have gotten his badge number. I wish I would have gotten his name. I wish I would have been able to do a report on it on our show and actually be like, hey, this is a cop from Culver city and this is what he did. Right? But I didn't think about it in the moment because I was so scared and I felt so powerless. I don't know. It was a crazy experience.

Speaker 2:          01:51:36       Okay, so here, here's why that's disturbing. This is turban cause you're this very powerful, intelligent, like outspoken person. You speak regularly online to untold millions of people worldwide in these videos. And yet in this one interaction, you were so taken aback by this carbon. So scare that you were crying and in in you, you didn't get this guy's badge number. You didn't get this guy. Who are you? Who has the recourse? You, who has the vehicle for delivering this information all over the world and exposing this real thing that you went through, you didn't. So now imagine a girl who's insecure, a girl who was terrified of public speaking, a girl who maybe has had some sort of a weird background that you grew up and she's in that sort of the same situation. She runs into that same asphalt.

Speaker 1:          01:52:30       Yeah, no, I, I can't even imagine it. I can't,

Speaker 2:          01:52:33       yeah, I mean they would be like shaking and weeping at freaking the fuck out and this guy gets off on that. I mean that's, that's really what you're dealing with and it shows how effective it is that it works on you cause you're not a pussy. No, I'm not saying that to a truck. Yeah, you

Speaker 6:          01:52:46       can say, you can say to me, I'm not going to be offended by it was the wrong thing. So you can call. Yeah, you can say it's like too confusing. It's like too many variables. You're not a coward. Not at all. You're you, you confront things and so for, for you to be freaked out by it, it should really sort of highlights what a confrontational situation that is and how it can really be a problem. And there were a lot of factors that played a role. Not only was there the power imbalance there, but there was also the fact that he was just this huge cop that was towering over me as I was standing there in front of him and I felt so small and I felt like he was so angry for no freaking reason that I was so scared that if I said the wrong thing, that he might do something to me.

Speaker 6:          01:53:33       You know? Even though, even though my cohort, there were three coworkers in the car after it all happened, they were like, that sounds insane. Cops will like literally like a really bad cop. Literally put himself in a situation where you put your hand up to stop him and if you touch him, that's assault and then they grab you and throw you to the ground. I mean, I've seen a scared, that's why I was so scared. I didn't know what he was going to do, but he definitely got off on me standing in front of him weeping like that. He definitely got off on the fact that I recognize that there was an imbalance of power there. And I don't know, like I, again, I think about it in retrospect and it makes me so angry and in the moment I was so powerless vigilante and just go running red lights to funds, motherfucker.

Speaker 6:          01:54:15       I mean I would love to son of a bitch, I wish I could identify him and I don't know, get some sort of justice, but imagine, think about that. Think about the relatively minuscule amount of discomfort I felt in that situation compared to what other people deal with. I mean, think about how powerless and how angry those people are. And so when you have angry protesters, right, that are responding to Ferguson or Eric Garner and all those other things, and then they have the media tell them, you guys are too violent, you need to calm down, can you understand why they'd be so angry? Oh, for sure. Yeah, I mean it totally makes sense that they would want to do something as disruptive as stopping the highway traffic. And it certainly does move the conversation because people have to address it. And it may be so impactful that cops might actually think twice before they squeeze a trigger because they don't want more craziness and more Russians of violence and or rather a protest, not violence. In fact, cops actually doing the van, you see that, that one undercover cop that got busted and he, he had a gun, he was pointing at the guy taking a picture because they were causing violence. There were doing shit, you know, like they, they've done this tactic for the longest time. Like one of the ways that they can stop protest is they use what's called agent provocateurs and agent provocateurs or someone who looks like a regular protester. But what

Speaker 5:          01:55:44       they are is police officers or military or people they hire and they go in and they'll wear bandanas and cover their face and shit and they'll start smashing things. They'll smash windows and they'll turn things into looting riot type situation so that the cops have reason to move in with force and start arresting people. And that's how they stop a peaceful protest. And it's so creepy that this is a tactic that has been used for a long time and it was always like one of those conspiracy theory, tin foil hat, stupid things, and then we realized, oh no, these motherfuckers really do this.

Speaker 1:          01:56:20       It happens. Yeah. I remember the first time I had heard about agent provocateurs, I was like, come on guys. How conspiratorial and loony is that? So loony, and then I realized it was happening with occupy. I realized that it was happening with recent protests and it's just, I love how they try to discredit peaceful protest by doing that, by coming in and looting and, and starting violence and making it seem as though all of the protesters are violent. Because again, the mainstream media is going to latch onto that. And you're right. I think that that's definitely better to drum up ratings. I mean, if you're going to do a news report on a peaceful protest, is that going to do well with ratings? Probably not. If you're going to do coverage of looting and violence that's taking place, um, in relation to the protest, people are going to be, they're going to get fired up, they're going to get angry and they're going to start referring to these protesters as animals and all that. I mean, I've seen so much of that,

Speaker 5:          01:57:14       but don't you see a resistance to people doing stories on the actual undercover cops? He got busted pointing the gun 100%. I don't see anything on that. I didn't see anything on that on CNN. I didn't see anything on that, on any of the coverage of the La riots. I was like, do you guys not understand what's going on here?

Speaker 1:          01:57:28       CNN is probably still reporting on the missing plane. I mean, see, I don't know where CNN is right now.

Speaker 5:          01:57:34       These, these riots in Oakland rather not la. Um, they, they were so fucking crazy, man. These kids took over highways. There's a lot of them, you know, in a lot of them got arrested and the to see that photo of that guy pointing a gun at the camera man, who's, who's pretending to be a protest. I was like, what the fuck is going on? Yeah. Like this is crazy. You guys are pretending to be protestors. You're smashing a window. You get paid tax dollars to smash windows

Speaker 1:          01:57:59       tax dollars. They get paid tax dollars to undermine a political process, a democratic process

Speaker 5:          01:58:05       and turn it violence so they can come and arrest people. That's amazing. It's so bizarre. So bizarre. You know, one other thing, those bizarre, I saw a lot of people that were quote unquote progressive's are quote unquote, you know, really leftwing strong left wing people. And they were in at least an if not an agreement. They were, they were, um, at least understanding of the people who looted and smashed windows. And one on one guy went to his, his Twitter page and he had this crazy statement like if people respect you, they'll respect your, obviously people didn't respect this place and it was like an h and r block with a brick through its window. I was like, what are you doing? Like, well this is crazy. Like Starbucks is there smashing Starbucks is

Speaker 1:          01:58:51       for corporations. No, I can't stand that. I mean that really does undermine attract people from what the real message is. The looters are not doing any great service to the protest. Question is how many of those looters are cops? How many of them don't know? I know many people who are like strong super

Speaker 5:          01:59:08       recipe bar getting caught up in the momentum that was actually kicked off by vigilante cops or even provoq agent provocateur

Speaker 1:          01:59:15       tour cops. Yeah, that would be hilarious. And you know, going back to the whole journalism angle of it, I mean that's what the great thing about investigative journalism would be. If we had strong investigative journalists in this country, they would take that beat and they would go to these protests and investigate and try to figure out how many agent provocateurs there are out there. Right. But we don't have that anymore. And that's what's scary. It's scary when you can only refer to a few people in the country as good journalists like Matt Taibbi, Michael Hastings at one point. Unfortunately he's not here anymore. Um, you know, the Jeremy Ski Hills of the world, I dunno.

Speaker 5:          01:59:48       Yeah. I don't know either. And we, we live in a very unique and interesting time of, uh, expanding possibilities. So it's, it's cool. It's cool to be a part of it and watched it all going down. But it's interesting trying to see it sort itself out, you know, has everything's going on, but it's, it's hopeful to me. Uh, I'm very hopeful, you know, even though there's a lot of fucked up shit in the world, I think that when I see these like Oakland protests, even though I don't agree with shutting down highways, I love the fact that there's this many people that are pissed off at the way things are going. Even if they're misguided in, in some way or overzealous in some way, they're their, their intentions are the correct type of intentions because they recognize that we have a kind of a wacky system.

Speaker 5:          02:00:32       Yeah. You know, and, and I, I think not enough attention is put on the idea of cops and the idea of being a cop being this insanely fucking difficult thing to manage. It's one of the reasons why you see so much violence. He sees that cop that was busted in Denver who had the guy on the ground, he was punching him in the face and the wife came over, she was pregnant, they trip the wife and she fell down and no, I didn't see. Oh. And then they took the guy's camera and erase the picture of race, the video. But he had already uploaded it to the cloud. So this guy got on the news with this video of this cop jazz, fucking throwing haymakers at this dude's face. You know, it's just, come on man, you don't have, there's no need to do that. You don't have to do that. You're, you're doing some, if you wanted to arrest someone for a crime, you don't have to punch him in the face. I don't even fighting back. It is crazy.

Speaker 1:          02:01:17       Yeah. I guess the only upside of it is the political activism that's coming out of it. Um, but it's, it's funny because, you know, you're mentioning how you're hopeful, but I feel like society keeps devolving. Like it gets worse and worse and now we have this whole situation like, you know, not to do a stark transition, but now we have like this ridiculous situation with Sony and like the and,

Speaker 6:          02:01:39       and how we have Kim Jong, Ooh. And dictating what kind of creative freedom we have here in this country. I mean, that kind of stuff is coming out now and you're just like, really? Is there really hope in this country right now? If the interview goes down, what hope could there possibly be? It's not even about the interview going, it's a Seth Rogen movie and they're not going to put it in the movie theater. We should just fucking move to the woods. We should all just give up and civilization. James Franco, James Franco's in that mirror to using that movie as well. So this is a double disaster. This is a huge box office head off the bat. It's going to be number one the first week it comes out. It's all strategically planned. Isn't that the best part of the story that a freaking comedy movie featuring Seth Rogen and James Franco is what caused like this ridiculous hack and it's what cause like the North Korean government to be up and I was like, I get it.

Speaker 6:          02:02:29       The storyline can be a little offensive to your dictator, right? If it has to do with assassinating him their dear leader. Right. But like I feel like this entire story in this entire situation is full of pussies. Right? Oh God, this is fucking crazy. Armenian Bra came in here, but it's true. It's true. You have policies on one side with Sony backing down from, from the movie you have supposedly North Korean pussies that are so offended by a movie. They're like, oh my God, how dare you offend our dear leader. We're going to go after you. I mean all around just a bunch of people that are scared and I get the email hack was devastating for Sony. A lot of private information, embarrassing information was leaked to the press. Right? But at the same time, like you, you can't let a dictator of a country like North Korea make decisions about what your company should district distribute as a movie.

Speaker 6:          02:03:26       Like it's ridiculous. No, Bama said it, which I thought was amazing. I go bomb was commenting on a movie being distributed. It should become an international affair. It really has. I don't know how this is gonna end up, but one thing that I will say is I'm not going to believe the feds that this is 100% in North Korea is doing. Like for some reason I find it inconceivable that it's a bunch of hackers from North Korea doing this 14 year old kid in Australia, in his underwear right now, laughing his ass off. I was thinking about that yesterday. It's speculation and I have no evidence to prove it right. But like a lot of these hackers are like teenagers and they're really smart and they're really savvy and sometimes they're not even smart and savvy. Sometimes people are really stupid with their passwords and all they have to do is guess, and the hackers will get into their email and that's it. Right?

Speaker 2:          02:04:16       Reality is if someone can break into your system, if you haven't found that someone isolated them and arrested them, then you don't know who the fuck they are. Okay. You just don't. So if you're, if you're just taking any old threat from someone like that, and it's saying it's Kim Jong Moon and you're not giving us any reason to believe you, we got, well, I don't know. I don't know if you're right. You might be right. It could be him. I mean, he's got 1800 cyber warriors. They're there. They're ready to rock and roll a fucking any given time. They're all in line that goose step over to their desks and at least start fucking people up all over the world for the dear leader.

Speaker 1:          02:04:51       And it's also kind of amazing that like in this day and age where we've given up so much of our individual liberty, our freedoms in the name of national security, all we need is one anonymous threat, that there would be another nine 11 type attack. And then we back out of like showing a movie. I mean, think about it. Think about how we're all spied on indiscriminately on a daily basis. Okay. Think about the fact that you know, after nine 11 we gave away so many of our rights because we were so afraid of these big bad terrorist and the government supposed to be keeping us safe, right? The CIA supposed to be on top of everything. Our intelligence is supposed to be top of the line and all it takes is one anonymous threat and people are like tucking tail and hiding behind the bed.

Speaker 2:          02:05:33       Isn't that the fault? I mean, or I shouldn't say the fault, isn't that the decision though of the company itself? Because Obama himself has said that he thinks that it was a mistake. So it really doesn't matter whether or not the CIA protects anybody or whether or not the FBI, they, it was their choice. Yeah. It never moved past that. So I don't think it's in that situation. I think it's fair to blame like the CIA or any of those people. It's just like they decided to pull it out. Oh, Mama told them that was a mistake.

Speaker 1:          02:06:00       No, no, I, I agree with you on that. But at the same time, like aren't we supposed to have certain agencies within our government that know everything because they're spying on everyone? This is the reality in argument for it, right? No, this is actually an argument against it because they spy on so many goddamn people that are completely innocent that their systems are just like full of information and data. That's absolutely useless. Okay. So the, that's one of the biggest issues that I have with this. Um, I interviewed Laura Poitras's on a show called take part live and she was getting into detail about that, about how the way that we collect intelligence right now is actually the most ineffective way because we're collecting so much data on people that are totally innocent. So how do you sift through all of this data and determine whether or not someone's an actual threat?

Speaker 2:          02:06:51       Yeah. How do you, do they have, uh, the, the building it like building a storage facilities, hoping they'll have better search mechanisms in the future? Is that the idea?

Speaker 1:          02:06:58       I have no idea. But what they're doing right now isn't working. I mean, when you have something like the Boston bombing and you have like terrorist attack, I mean, look, we, we don't have terrorists attacks here all the time. You know what I mean? Like despite the fear mongering that you see in the mainstream media, um, it's just fear mongering, right? But every once in a while when you do have some sort of event like the Boston bombing, it's like, well, I don't know NSA. You've been collecting all this information on everyone and you have these people that are posting things online, talking about how they want to kill Americans and plotting to do certain things. How come you didn't catch these guys? Well, like why is it that you guys are focusing so heavily on the type of porn people are, but you're not focusing heavily on, you know, the real threats that are out.

Speaker 2:          02:07:38       Well, that's where it's a real shame when you've got a bunch of agent provocateurs at occupy Wall Street where nothing bad is happening. That's, that's where it's a shame. It's like, I don't know who, what agency they're from, whether or not they could be involved with some sort of a terrorist activity, uh, investigation unit. But if you, if you wasted resources looking after hippies and a drum circle and that could have possibly saved somebody's life, he we're going to be like really understandably pissed off, which is one of the things about this agent provocateur thing in Oakland, the piss people off. It's like, come on. Yeah, we're paying for that. We actually pay for that. Our taxes. Every citizen contributes to the payroll. I mean that's crazy. They're paying you guys to undermine us and you guys to break windows and pretend you're fucking bad protesters and tried to start people looting so that you can get come in and sweep them into the paddy wagon and fulfill quotas. That's the weirdest thing. Like what the fuck would they do if we all collectively as a country decided we will not break any laws for 30 days, they'll probably frame us. They would have to start framing us. We, their budgets would fall apart there. They're fucking departments would fall apart when it came time to like budget meetings and shit. Well we've had no crime since 19 blah, blah, blah blah.

Speaker 1:          02:08:48       Why do you think a police enforcement for the most part is against legalizing marijuana or legalizing drugs in general? It's because they will be out of jobs. I mean, there will still be crime, obviously, but when you look at our incarceration rate and how we incarcerate more people than any other country in the world, it's because of drug laws and there is a lot of profit to be made off. The prohibition of marijuana. Cops make money off of it that keeps them in business. Correctional officers remain in business. Private prisons remain in business. There's a lot of money behind prohibition.

Speaker 2:          02:09:24       Yeah. Stopping people from doing things that they want to do. Yeah, that doesn't hurt you is ridiculous and it's some daddy shit. You're your daddying people. You're telling them what they can and can't do, and then I include things that I'm totally opposed to like cigarettes. I think cigarettes are the dumbest way to die. It just drives me crazy when I see good friends who have a problem with cigarettes and they can't kick it. I'm like, I'm watching you poison yourself. Like this is so stupid, but I'm 100% in favor. You'd be able to do it if you want to do it. Same here. Fuck. Who is anybody to tell another person what they can't do. It's one thing to tell a person, don't commit a crime or don't commit assault or don't harm people, but that's the number one problem with the government telling you that anything is illegal, whether it's mushrooms or prostitution or anything. It says who says who.

Speaker 1:          02:10:10       Look, that's one of the reasons why I'm in favor of legalizing things and regulating them with common sense regulations. So like with prostitution, legalize and regulate it. Okay, so these people can say it's safe when they're trading sex for money with drugs, obviously I'm not saying, hey, this is a wild, wild west, let's legalize everything and not have any regulations. And that's usually what are like, that's the type of argument that pro prohibition people will say, right? Like, Oh, if you legalize it, all of a sudden like 10 year olds are going to be smoking pot. No they're not. No they're not. We have laws put in place to make sure that 10 year olds aren't drinking alcohol. You do the same thing with marijuana.

Speaker 2:          02:10:46       There's also an issue with a, there's not an issue of public opinion because public opinion is very important, but there is an issue with needing 50% or more of the people to agree in order to give you freedom. Like, Whoa, Whoa, Whoa, Whoa, whoa, Whoa, whoa. It's not that hard to trick. Half the people, they have mortgages and fucking softball. They have to get their kids dressed for and there, you know, it's not that hard to trick people about stories of brain damage and memory loss and men Bra and tits, that there's plenty of fake data that you can bandy around in court and, and, and people could get confused. So 50% is not good. 50% is not a healthy number. What it should be. Let's find out first what category we put these laws in. Here's a category. Does it hurt anybody else? No.

Speaker 2:          02:11:35       Okay. So let's, let's, this is a personal choice category. Yes. So it should, it doesn't even have to be 1% right. This is what it should be. How many people are opposed to it and what are your reasons for being opposed to it and are they rational and are they based on the data we currently are aware of? Yeah. And if they're not, they're not valid. And you need to say like, do you believe that marijuana makes you grow tits? Do you believe that marijuana, cause I had like some lady, she was telling me testicular cancer, I'm like what are you talking about? Yeah. Or read it online. Like no, you did

Speaker 1:          02:12:06       must making this up. Well and also if you've read it online, it must be true

Speaker 2:          02:12:10       person. My point is, could vote on it. If they went to the ballot and they go, Oh fuck that. I don't want my children hooked on. We click and they hit that there. Their vote, whether informed or not. It's valid. And I think you should have to prove that your, your point in some way is informed.

Speaker 1:          02:12:26       Well, one, that's one of the issues with ballot initiatives. Um, not only are people either uninformed, but they're also misinformed a lot of times because there's a lot of money behind the advertisements that are either for or against ballot initiatives. Right. And the thing that amazes me about political ads is politicians can straight out lie. Yeah. Political action committees can straight out lie in any political ad. And why is it that when it comes to an advertisement for a product like beer for instance, right? Like if Samuel Adams was to advertise right now, like our beer is going to give you super powers and you're gonna all of a sudden lose 20 pounds and like they can't do that. It's false advertising. Why is it the politicians are able to falsely advertise whatever the hell they want? It's probably because they're the gatekeepers and they're the ones who get to decide whether or not something is illegal. But I've seen so many political ads where I'm like, that's not true. That's not true. Why are they able to say this? That's amazing. So with ballot initiatives, if there's money behind, you know, there's legalized bribery behind a lot of it. Um, there's a lot of misinformation behind a lot of it. And if you're not someone who sits

Speaker 4:          02:13:32       down and analyzes political news all day, it's very easy for you to be misinformed. And that's not your fault. It's because of the system and how it's set up against you. Yeah. And it's also known as an incentive to change it, to make it even. Yeah. You know, why would we do that? Let everybody wait a bit. We're going to make less money and what else is going to happen? There's going to be less jobs and what else is going to happen? They're going to have some power. Fuck. It's the same thing with climate change. I mean, people immediately go to Oh, less jobs and that's all I really care about. I've had conversations with that, with people about that. When they see, um, the, uh, all the oil work that do end up in Canada, that devastation to the environment around it. And you're like looking at photos, you're like, Holy Shit.

Speaker 4:          02:14:12       And people are like, oh, relax. It's just a little bit, because so many jobs are dependent upon that. They're very, very sensitive to people criticizing it. If you don't know, if you're not from around there, I mean they, that's like a major source of income for a lot of folks up there and I understand it because that's your livelihood and you don't want anyone messing with their livelihood, which is why it's so important for the federal government to invest in renewable energy because then you transfer the jobs, you know, from dirty coal and whatever the hell we're doing to renewable energy sources. New Jobs can be created, but we're not even willing to have that conversation because right now we're stuck on this ridiculous debate as to whether or not climate change is manmade or not. Why are we having that debate? Why are we having that debate drives me crazy.

Speaker 4:          02:14:55       I think we need to work in la for sure on solar. It's so ridiculous that we live in a place that's literally sunny 300 days a year and if you fly over it, you don't see a single solar panel. It's crazy. I know that the expense of the technology is right now it's pretty high, but I guarantee within the next decade or so, it's gonna drop down to some sort of a manageable point where people will consider installing them on the top of every building. Yeah, you've got free electricity. I mean, it's gotta be worth something. It's even if, even if it's not 100% of your electrical output, it's probably like high forties 50 I mean, I don't know, but as they get better at these things, I mean they figured out some new, it's like a spray on panel that you can, they can take electricity from, from the air spray on solar panels.

Speaker 4:          02:15:42       Shut up. Really? Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Amazing. There's all kinds of new, is that every, they're fully transparent solar cell that could make every window and screen up power source. Jesus fucking Christ. That's amazing. I love it. God Damn geniuses that dance around amongst us. We're mere apes. We are mere Abe's. We were mere apes. We really are. That someone figured out a way to make glass power up your fucking TV. No, I know. I should have this conversation. I've had these like philosophical conversations with Jank on our post game show for our members and like I'm probably the post like pessimistic self deprecating person on the planet because oftentimes in our post game shows I have like these like quarter life crises where I talk about how I'm a failure and how I haven't done anything meaningful with my life. I mean think about like you see stuff

Speaker 1:          02:16:30       like that. You see these like astrophysicists and these neuroscientists and all these amazing intelligent people and you're like, what do I do? I just read the news and I comment on it. You know, and that sounds very self deprecating, but it's true. Like I wish I could do something that actually changes. It changes the world like that. That actually saves the planet.

Speaker 2:          02:16:47       You want me to say that fucking egg head, how to do your job. He would suck at it. People always tell me not to make me feel better, but what his legs looked like. Shit, he's wearing a fucking wearing your shoes. They don't fit. If you put them in your job, it would be terrible at it. You've got to realize that like everybody has their own little station in this life. If you really true, if you really treat life for what it is, it's some sort of a weird experience. You know, it's a temporary experience. It lasts a long time relatively in your, you know, like in comparison to like holding in your pee. Yeah. You'll life lasts a long fucking time. But the reality of it is it slips away pretty God damn quickly. Yeah. And the things that we dwell on our like these markers of like achievement and these like measures of success and these, you know, the our, our ability to measure ourselves against the other people that were competing with or some sort of a weird way, but all that stuff is self defeating.

Speaker 2:          02:17:39       W we really need to do is find some sort of a comfortable medium where we're actually doing what we want to do most of the time. And obviously what you want to do is what you're doing. When if you were that fucking dude and you're doing computations till three o'clock in the morning on some fucking glass, it's going to make electricity and nobody gives a shit what your shoes look like. You'd be like, fuck this job. This job sucks. I'm tired of working 16 hours a day on fucking stupid solar glass. I'm tired. I'm tired. I want to be a reporter. I want to be on TV. I want to wear cute clothes. Come on. What the fuck? All right, fair enough. Fair. You wouldn't be happy. You're happy with,

Speaker 1:          02:18:15       I love what I do. Don't get me wrong. I love what I do. But every once in a while, you know, you do, you do size people up,

Speaker 2:          02:18:20       right? Of will. Especially because you're an educated, successful woman who already, you're already a little bit a little bit of chip on your shoulder plus your Armenian and then you're out there in this competitive environment where in all fairness, I think women have to, uh, I feel they feel at least that they have to prove themselves maybe even 10% more than men who are just as competent as them just to be accepted as like, as at that same level because men have this idea, oh, she just wants to get pregnant and then she's going to take paternity leave and she's not serious about this job. And there's a lot of people that have those kind of prejudices about women in the workforce. So you all automatically have to get gangster on people. So you're, you're, you're always ramped up an extra 10%.

Speaker 1:          02:19:02       Yeah. There's also, there's also this notion, and I don't know, Chris is looking at me.

Speaker 2:          02:19:06       Nailed it. I know, I know. I got you. I got you. I know. What's up.

Speaker 1:          02:19:10       There's also like this notion that like an attractive woman can't be smart, like rude, like a comment that I get often and it's a sweet comment and I love people that send this to me, but I think that they're a little misguided is like, oh yeah, beauty and brains such a rarity. And it's like, no, it's, it's not, it's

Speaker 2:          02:19:28       not a rarity and I want you to be dumber because that way they can fuck you. They can throw their, their tricks and their Voodoo on you and they get fuck you. But I think a year, one of the more intelligent podcast guests that I have, Rhonda, Patrick [inaudible] Patrick, every time I got damn talk to her, I don't know half the shit she's talking about is this doctor Rhonda Patrick who's a found my fitness on Twitter. She's amazing. And she comes on the podcast like every few months and breaks down all sorts of different issues between new vitamin absorption in the last one was head trauma. Like she schooled me on head trauma and the issues with head trauma, like all the things that I kind of like had she like in depth, described them in great detail. And like as she's talking like my, my, I'm just trying to just keep up at all at this certain point in time.

Speaker 2:          02:20:14       So I'm just tapping out on my, I'm going to have to go over this after it's over and take notes cause there's no fucking way, cause she'll go on, he's like 10 15 minutes. Super Complicated rants. Like I've talked to people on Twitter that said they listened to that podcast seven times. They just listened to it over and over and over again. Like what vitamin B complex is most important for this and what it contributes to what vitamin D contributes to a muscle fiber growth. And we're going to go and she hits you with all this different shit and it's like whoa. And she's beautiful. So that's nonsense. She's way fucking smarter than me. There's a lot of, I mean it's, it's, there's a lot of like really good looking guys that are smart as fuck. And for some dudes that's annoying as shit. He said it's beautiful, handsome, a Donna's character and you're like that stupid fuck.

Speaker 2:          02:20:56       Meanwhile, he's a phd, like Vladimir Klitschko, the fucking heavyweight champion of the world. He's a doctor. He's got a fucking phd, six, six and shredded. He speaks four languages and it'll fuck you up and nobody wants to believe that you want to take. Oh, that fucking meathead. Always a boxer. Yeah, I bet he's real smart. He's way smarter than you. He plays chess every day. All right. He's, he's a fucking world champion boxer for like tech. Look at that handsome bastard. That's the heavyweight champion of the world. Get the fuck Outta here. He's a super athlete from the future. That's some Russian fucking engineering shit that doesn't even make sense. How tall is that dude? He's like six, six or something. You look just like that without your shirt on. Christian. Oh, this place got hot and heavy. Six six two 40 Jesus fucking Christ. Six six to 40 with a doctorate degree.

Speaker 2:          02:21:53       Nobody wants to admit that they want to big fucking mood hood. That big fit. He's way smarter than you and I'll fuck you up. Sorry. But you're probably better at PAC man. Yeah, I'm probably better at world of Warcraft. You've probably got a higher rating. It doesn't. You know like, people are weird, man. We, everybody wants it to be a goddamn race from beginning to end. Enjoy your life. Everybody gets a different hand of cards. Do whatever the fuck you can with it. Don't get crazy because it doesn't last. It's just have some fun. Tried to make it the most enjoyable. That's six foot six fucking Adonis. He might be miserable. What do I, what do I know? You know you might have a wife screams at him. Throw shit out of him. We don't know. You don't know what his life is like. You know, he might have shitty taste in music.

Speaker 2:          02:22:31       You might have like, you know, you might fucking be listening to terrible music all day and you're like, I hate him. I don't want to beat him. We're weird. We're weird. We, we compare like you're comparing yourself to the solar glass people. I'm like, thank God those egg heads are out there. Much love to you. Tweet something, Holler at me. I help you out. As long as you're doing something you enjoy, as long as you're surrounded by people that you love, you got to, you got to enjoy the moment a little bit. Which is what he tells me all the time with Cubans don't have to rocket. Oh yeah, they do. They do Cuban. That's a, that's a fun. Like Joey Dee is my favorite human being of all time. He's born in Cuba. He's, he knows. They just, there's a different flair to the Latin cultures they have.

Speaker 2:          02:23:14       They have more fun. Like we're, we get more shit done. We do, we get more shit done, but what do you want? Do you want to get more shit done or do you want to have more fun? And it becomes like this balancing act of man. I don't know because like you said, like people that are the most happy in the world. I did this some sort of a, you know, an index of most happy countries. Mexico was pretty fucking high. I'm very surprised about that really was, especially in good time, good for them, good for them. You know, we, we are caught up in this idea that unless you're keeping tabs, unless you're numbers are ahead of their numbers or your position or your social caste systems ahead, then you shouldn't be happy. But it's so stupid. Like, you know what? You need happiness friends, hanging around with a bunch of friends, have a good time, do stuff that you like.

Speaker 2:          02:24:01       That's it. Be Nice to each other. You'll get more friends. Be Nice to those friends. There'll be loyal to you. You'll be loyal to them, your brothers and sisters. You stay together forever. Everybody's cool. It's all you have to do is you find a gang of friends. He collect friends that are cool and you enforce your love for them and they enforce their love for you and you shield yourself from the outside world by forming these pockets and communities of awesome people that can be done, that can be done, but it can't be done if you're fucking king. Shit real estate mogul once a fuck over your partners and your investors and you're just trying to pump and dump stocks and fuck you like the guy in wolf of Wall Street. Like that sort of crazy mentality. Capitalism above all costs, like you're missing out on the balancing act of life.

Speaker 2:          02:24:43       You're just, you're an asshole. You're a guy who thinks he's gonna run the marathon by running as fast as you can right from the beginning. No one's, no one's ever thought of that. Everybody started that stupid. You can't do that. You can't sprint for three hours. You fuckhead. It's not possible. Everyone knows by now. So when you're doing that, what you're really doing is you're sprinting you're way through the beginning, couple miles of a marathon to fucking die. That's what you're doing. You're treating life like a moron. This is better than any therapy session I've ever had. This is great. I feel better about life. I did too. I do too. It's coming out of me and I feel better about it, but that's what you know. I mean, and everybody says like, you know, hey me, you know, that's easy for you or I can't afford it.

Speaker 2:          02:25:25       Without a doubt, everyone has different circumstances, but without a doubt, every circumstances could be managed more optimally. Every single one that's ever existed, we're flawed and we learned from our mistakes, which means everyone approaches every single situation in their life where you're just kind of basing it off of the information that you've acquired, the knowledge that you've gathered, the experience that you've sorta calculated in your brain, and this is how I think, and then if it goes fucking Shitty, like your cop situation, yeah, you go, well, now I got some fucking new shit in here and the next mother fucker the tries that nonsense. Yeah. I'm, I'm asking questions, I'm writing things down and I'm making a fucking story and I'm making a fucking difference. That's the difference. That's what happens with us. We grow and learn. I mean, that's, that's what it's all about.

Speaker 1:          02:26:11       Yeah. Yeah, absolutely. There's no question about it. I would say like the happiest moments of my life. We're not. When I was sitting there competing with other people or trying to achieve more in my career, it was definitely moments where I traveled somewhere with a really good friend moments where I've, you know, shared like a really great meal with a coworker. Like those are the things that are more memorable and I think that my generation is moving away from like the obsession of owning big things, right? Like less people in my generation are buying homes partly because they can't do it because they're straddled with student loan debt, but also because they don't want to be tied down to one place. They want to go see the world, they want to go experience things. And so, you know, we talked about this a little bit the first time I was on your podcast, but sometimes I struggle with that too, right? Sometimes I'm like, yeah, I want to buy a big house. And then other times I'm like looking at my quaint little apartment and I'm like, this is fine. I'd rather have some money saved in the bank to go on some cool trip and like meet people and learn new things.

Speaker 2:          02:27:10       If I was Joey Diaz right now I go on a rant about fuck that shit. You getting paid need a fucking big crib with pillars like Elvis had marble shit like they had in Greece. What the fuck you told me you gotta keep your money in the bank and those fucking people going to steal it on. You get the fuck Outta here. You want a Bentley and a fucking jet and a helicopter and missile launchers and a fucking pool your face on the bottom of it. That's what Joey d is it say. And I agree with him. You're making a lot of money. You should fucking spend that shit. Fuck a one bedroom apartment.

Speaker 1:          02:27:41       Hello.

Speaker 2:          02:27:43       But yeah, you just have fun. It's, it's hard for people to do. Sorry people we quantify too much. We do quantify our lives too much. You know, question. But you know, I think there's one thing that if I could ever give, especially men advice, healthy friendly competition, that is the difference. The real problem that people have with competition is, is very self defeating. And a lot of times losing at things is insanely frustrating and it makes men especially angry. And this is a trap and this is a trap. And it's essentially a non management of a biological system that's put in place to allow you to try to rise to the highest possible spot and the social spectrum for you to breed. And it's a trick and that trick is in place and it can fuck men up so they can get angry at their best friends. If they're playing pickup basketball, they can get to a point where they want to have fistfights over basketball and men. But if they didn't, if the exact same thing happen and they still experienced the heightened sense of competitiveness, but always with friendship and love for the person you're competing with, you can have better results. You can have better results because you're still gonna have that same competitive drive, but you never allow yourself to hate the opponent. You waste energy. In fact, when you hate the opponent,

Speaker 1:          02:29:00       I think, I mean, I don't know if this is the same for men, but whenever I meet a woman who's super accomplished and I feel a little bit of envy, I actually just picks you turn green. I know, right? No, I actually use that as more of an inspirational thing as opposed to like, oh, I hate her and now I'm going to like tear her down and try to find her fault so I could feel better about, feel better about myself. I love meeting really successful women that shake me out of my complacency because as humans we love to be complacent. Whether or not we are aware of it, we kind of like slide into that, you know, comfort zone. And so I like it when I meet a woman who's like smarter than me, more successful than me and subtle like hating on her. I'll be like, what can I do to be like her or better than yes. Yeah,

Speaker 2:          02:29:48       that's healthy. That's very healthy. And being inspired by people that you meet, especially people that are doing like what you're doing for a living or what you're doing or for a hobby or anything that you, you know, any pursuit, whether it money's involved in art, um, Eh, they can be incredibly empowering tor or defeating and with, with men especially men have a real issue in denial of the actual competitive nature of the scenario. Like there's some men that they have this idea of what they look like and the, this idea of what a bad mother fucker they are and how cool they are now front of the Ark and the rest of the world has a completely different opinion. Yup. And they don't, they don't ever allow themselves to see what they're doing wrong because then it chips away at this armor that they've put on this armor being this false opinion of themselves and they go out of their way to make sure that's never exposed through trial.

Speaker 2:          02:30:38       And that's what one of the things that separates people who do difficult things. Anything that's really hard to do. I think in doing something that's very difficult, whether it's, you know, running fucking marathons or climbing mountains or martial arts or anything you're doing, it's hard to do. You learn about your ability to push yourself. You learn how to overcome obstacles. You learn about yourself in a way that people that are sort of in denial about where their standing as far as how good they are at anything. You know, there's some people that think through the shit, they don't even have a job. But yeah, Bro, I'm shit falls working there. I'd be fucking running things Balsa president ma, but fuck off till Russia to suck my Dick Man, new Pabst blue ribbon gets opened. You know, there's a lot of people that think they're fucking awesome, but if you peered in on them, you know, if you had a window into their trailer and you saw their fucking no dirty socks and their foot's kicked up on the couch, you'd be like, Oh my God, you fucking idiot. You don't know how the world sees you. And for men especially, it's like the, the need to be little competition is a very dangerous thing. You know, the, the need to not be empowered by people that are better that you see around you. Cause when you, when you see them and you embrace and you have no hate in your heart, then you can actually be empowered and it'll actually make you better at whatever you do.

Speaker 1:          02:31:55       Yeah, absolutely. You got to learn from people around you. You know, you got to learn from the mistakes that people make around you. You got to learn from the people who are doing things that are better than what you're doing and, and don't, my tendency is to feel down about myself time to time. I don't end up hating the person who's better than me. I start like being very critical, overly critical of myself. Like don't let that happen either because that's very destructive. Yeah. Um, but yeah, like I'm lucky that I work in a field where I'm exposed to super intelligent people on a regular basis. Like, you know, I don't agree with everything that Jank says. Uh, we have differences of opinion in a lot of it.

Speaker 2:          02:32:31       They think that and I'm going to edit it and I'm going to send it to them right now, motherfucker.

Speaker 1:          02:32:35       Um, but Genx, my mentor, you know, I learned a lot from him and I'm so grateful that I was able to like grow next to him and learn a lot of stuff. And he also built a company that expanded to the point where we're, we have a steady flow of intelligent people coming in all the time. We have these great conversations. I'm always learning new things. I love that. I have a job where I get to learn new things. You get that too. And it's awesome where you know, you guys have a dope office to you. Like this is a corporation. You guys are a corporation, you have a fucking staff dude. It wasn't always like that or workstations and everyone's friendly though. It's very nice people super fast with you by the way, when you came in. Not like in a creepy way. Um, so I'm going to give him a shout out because he's a big fan and he's like, well listening right now. Um, how Hassan who's actually genx nephew is like such a big fan of yours. And he was like, oh, Joe, Joe's going to be at the Improv. Like I gotta go, I gotta go see Joe. And then I noticed that like as soon as he saw you walking through the studio, he wanted to take a picture with you. And I was like, oh my God, how's, you're so embarrassing. Please stop.

Speaker 2:          02:33:34       Oh, that's all right. He's a person so it doesn't embarrass me. It's fine. So shout out to Hassan. Yes. No, you guys have like a real corporation. Like you go in there, it feels like you know what you're doing. You go in here. If Jamie died, I'd be fucked. Bring Brian in here every day. Be a disaster again. Huh?

Speaker 1:          02:33:50       Okay. How is Brian? He doesn't, he's not here yet.

Speaker 2:          02:33:54       Well, if sums podcasts, he doesn't do it. Oh, I see. He does ones that I feel like he would be best suited for. I see. I see. Okay. If that makes sense. I think too, you can only do so many podcasts with the same person over and over again. You know, I think, I think, uh, one of the things about doing podcasts is you've got to do what? Like you gotta talk to the people you want to talk to have the conference. You've got to do it when you want to do it. Like that's the whole idea behind it to me is that, you know, there is no set schedule. There is no employer that's telling me what I can and can't talk about gas than I'm being forced to interview. Right. That's the worst. That's the worst. Yeah. The cool thing about it too is that it's now podcasting has become something that people are willing to do. Like I had Paul Stanley from kiss on this this year and I was like, you gotta get the Fuck Outta here. I can't believe I got Paul Stanley sitting here. I was such a little fan boy. Yeah. Such a little fan with Joe Perry, Joe Perry's my friend Joe Perry from Aerosmith. I'm like, this is my friend Joe Perry.

Speaker 1:          02:34:53       You have to give yourself some credit though because you do a three hour long podcast in the middle of nowhere La wise. It's not hard to do. It's not, it's not. But it's intimidating if you haven't done it before. So before I came into the first podcast with you, I was definitely nervous. I'm like, oh my God, three hours. Like what are we going to talk about for three freaking hours straight, no breaks, no nothing. Right? Um, so the fact that you know, these big name, people are willing, not me, but like, uh, you know, the people you mentioned earlier are willing to come in and sit down with you for three hours. That that means that you've, you've made it my friend.

Speaker 2:          02:35:25       I don't even know what that means, but it's pretty cool to be able to talk to Rosanne bar for three hours. Roseanne Barr isn't awesome. Roseanne, Paul has given me a hard time the other day because we had this show on. And uh, there was uh, no chicks and the show and I said that I secretly, she goes, what the hell? No women on the show at all. Question Mark. And I said, I secretly made no women on the show, just cause I knew you would complain. Success, that's fine. And then she said, well, you know something to the lines of, you're on the show that I guess a chick is on the show. And I said, well, if you're calling me a chicken, you're a check. That's a compliment. She's great. She's awesome. She's so crazy. She is. She's in my opinion, one of the all time great comics.

Speaker 2:          02:36:02       Like she doesn't get a, and I told her that when she was in the studio, like if I had a list of 10 time, uh, you know, top 10, like mo most important comics in my opinion, she, she became a totally unique and new thing. Like when she burst onto the scene, she was like murder in it and doing these HBO specials, they had never been a woman like her before telling men to suck it shot up. You know, she had this like fucking attitude with good joke writing. Like that attitude plus good joke writing and a genuine, not give a fuck outlook on things. Yeah. And now when she talks, it was really funny because she talks about her life. She's super honest, but I'll crazy and off the rails. She was awesome. She's the best.

Speaker 1:          02:36:44       A really good friend of mine, Dave Ruben, who also does a show for our network is very good friends with Roseanne and she apparently has like a TV studio like that. She built herself and he's now like doing some shows like out of her TV studio. Um, and like I've heard stories about how freaking awesome she is and I love it. I love how open she is and I don't know, she's a lot of, I've met her a few times too. She's great.

Speaker 2:          02:37:07       She's out. And she also is not dogmatic, you know, she had this idea about chem trails all, they're spraying things in the sky, you know, and I, and we had this conversation about it and I said that's not, they're not really doing that. That's not what's happening. I'll tell you exactly what's happening. Cause we investigated it and there's a lot of people to believe that, but they really haven't looked into it. It's scientifically been proven that when a jet engine goes through the atmosphere, it was a certain temperature and a certain amount of condensation. It actually produces artificial clouds. Yeah. It's a very scientific principle behind it. It's really easy to understand and you see it explained and go, oh, that's what it is. And so they're always like, well, why is it always in grid pattern? Like I had a guy on the podcast and like us, that's what flights do. They go the same way every day. It's a flight pattern. You think planes just take off like a boat out in the ocean. Just any fucking path they want. You know, like you've got to fucking sailboat. You just left and right. No, you don't have to go exactly where they tell you to otherwise just slamming each other. You fuck, you know, like so, but when I told her this, she sort of went, oh, okay. Like she, like she didn't, she didn't get crazy red in the face.

Speaker 1:          02:38:10       Right. I heard that is such an admirable quality in people because when someone's pointing to something you just said and they were like, no, it's actually wrong. Here's what the reality is. I mean, I think the human and, and you know, understandable reaction is to like try to defend yourself. Yeah. Even though you know you're wrong and it's like the best feeling when you finally just like recognize like, oh, I'm wrong. I'm just going to admit that I'm wrong and an do more research into it and figure it out. You know what I mean? I think that's more admirable than like, no, I'm gonna defend myself. Even though you have evidence proving that what I've just said is bullshit.

Speaker 2:          02:38:43       Well, I think people are learning now in this day and age that it's, there's really no benefit in pretending you're never wrong. Yeah. Especially when it comes to things that are like you. No one has all the information. Exactly. You can't. There's too much going on in the world. You know everything about aviation do everything about viruses. You know everything about computer codes. You know everything about Portuguese. You can't, there's too much shit. You don't have enough time in the day. Yeah. So you might have a misconception in your mind, doesn't mean you're a fucking idiot. It means you were wrong. You're a fucking idiot if you continue to cling to it, even while it's being explained to you that it's not correct. That's what makes you a fucking idiot. And unfortunately, especially for men, again, we cling to ideas. We don't want to ever say we were wrong because then we give up this position of being smarter. Right? This position of being better or winning.

Speaker 1:          02:39:33       Yeah. I, Kevin Pereira said something to me that I loved and it's so true. He's like, what's wrong with saying I don't know, time to time. So you know, and and it's true. Like there's like this fear, especially when you do an interview with someone or when you come on a podcast that someone's going to ask you something that you don't know the answer to and then you have to utter the words. I don't know because you're going to get criticism for it, but like why? It's not like I know everything that there is to know. That's crazy.

Speaker 2:          02:40:02       Those two percents out there counting it up. That's what it is. Those are the ones who are going to complain because those are the ones who are not going to know. Of course, you can't know everything. She goes, I can't believe you. Just know what the Balton island.

Speaker 5:          02:40:14       Just always going to be someone he's going to be that problem. And you know there's, there's a lot of people that are out there and they pretend that this never comes up in their life. Why don't you just talk about things and I'm not aware of, of course you do stupid, have a contact, have a conversation with someone you don't know. You just start talking to you about some shit you don't know about. You know someone from somewhere else. So it's a different kind of life. You couldn't possibly know what they know. Exactly. No one can know everything and it doesn't mean you're dumb. And that's the problem is that in small social circles or especially where the instinct probably comes from tribal situations, you all have access to the same amount of data. The one who knows more is the one who's more wise.

Speaker 5:          02:40:53       It was the one who paid more attention or the one who has more experience or more success. So that man becomes preferable. And so when you're in an open environment like earth in 2000 and almost 15 you can't do that anymore. That's stupid. There's too much shit out there. Like the amount of data is unprocessable when it's about, oh, don't eat that yellow leaf because it gives you diarrhea. You know, you eat the green leaf and you're dead in 15 minutes. Like you got to know that stuff or are you going to, you're a dumb ass out in the jungle and you're going to die. Right, exactly. But that's a finite amount of shit. You know, there's the, it's just about like what fish will kill you if it bites your Dick, you know, like this, you don't, you, you know, the amount of data that you have to process being a human with a computer today, it's unsurmountable

Speaker 1:          02:41:36       on, it really is. It really is. So there's no shame in saying, I don't know. In fact, I, I trust people more when they say, I don't know. Because the worst thing is when you have someone in the media who has no freaking idea what they're talking about and they're just bullshitting their way through an interview or bull, you know, like, you know, Sarah Pailin wasn't so good at bullshitting her way through it. But instead of saying, I don't know, her dumb ass tried to answer questions and like the most ignorant way possible.

Speaker 5:          02:42:00       Well she got busted the the whole thing. The can of worms opened up with that Katie Kirk, that was so, it turned out that she has read anything but like so obvious. Oh you know, you know as a shit. I read newspapers, I'm reading fortune cookies and stuff. I checked a Chinaman. She just decided to just go on that with no preparation and just charm her way through it. I bet you thought it was just going to be all softballs,

Speaker 1:          02:42:25       but that's the thing a lot of, first of all, a lot of the questions were soft ball.

Speaker 5:          02:42:29       I mean how about this, do you think that that same approach would have ever been done if it was a man? Do you think that a man from Alaska would be asked what books he reads or what newspapers he subscribes to? I bet they wouldn't.

Speaker 1:          02:42:40       Well, I think that honestly with the way the interview went, it started off with respectable question, respectful questions. It wasn't, it wasn't like a gender thing at all. Like, Oh, you're a woman, so I'm going to softball you. I think that Katie realize that this woman has no idea what she's talking about. And so her follow up questions were super tame, you know, kind of like, all right, we'll do you read news? Yeah. It never got really confrontational the way maybe you would do it right? I mean you would go after. Yeah, I think. I would think so too. Um, I remember

Speaker 4:          02:43:12       one when I was at, but I think Katie was probably setting her up. She's probably had given her some soft jabs. Yeah. Waiting to drop that. What do you read bitch playing? You know, think they researched and found out that chick doesn't read anything. I probably, they probably did. I actually, I think that Katie Couric was tactful. She, she handled it. Jamie agrees. Yeah. Sat her up big right hand. She, what do you read bitch? Plam the knees go, eyes rolled back. She plus, well Harold is a little bit of that like Katie's thing and I could be the fucking president too. Wow. Think about that for a second. Think about how that woman almost became the vice president of the United States. SORTA. Kinda. Yeah. It would've been fun. Just like Dan Quayle who do the same type of shit, Mccain's still alive look all these whoa through. So she wouldn't really have any influence, but maybe though the job might have killed him cause we don't know what Obama really would have looked like if he never got that Gig. I mean he might've all black hair right now. Could you imagine that? Yeah. He looked like pretty similar to the way he looks six years ago.

Speaker 1:          02:44:11       I mean he aged so much in six years. We'll do about how terrible this job. I would never want to be president of the youth. I wouldn't want to be a politician, period. It sounds like it.

Speaker 4:          02:44:19       Terrible job. It almost sounds like an incredibly flawed system that is taking part in in the where it's like almost like the answer trying to rebuild the ant colony while they're carrying leaves in like, guys, we've got to make new tunnels. Fuck off. Carry this. Yeah. How are you going to fix this gigantic ant colony? You're not going to fix that. It's a great analogy. I love that, but isn't it like that kind of, in a way it's like you, even if you're the president, even if you're the one person that gets to talk to Congress and you have debate and you do speeches and all this different there, the reality is, Mike, God would, a machine is behind this fucking world. Oh my God. How many influences my God, how much money, my God, how much long standing patterns of behavior that are very difficult to change like a lobbyists.

Speaker 4:          02:44:59       But if somebody tried to propose lobbyists today in the age of the Internet, if like there was no lobbyists and they tried to come along and propose a lot of people like get the fuck out, 100% what are you talking about? 100% if the Internet got to vote on whether or not Congress would allow corporations to donate money like an individual, they would go, are you fucking crazy? Why would we do that? Why would we do that? Why would it be? What's the benefit? Dirtier rivers like what? What's the benefit there? What's, what's, what's going to come out of that. That's good.

Speaker 1:          02:45:29       I know. It's crazy. Yeah. The system is definitely set up against us and the entire notion of a democratic process. You can't have a democratic process when you have corporations giving unlimited amounts of money to politicians. It's just not going to happen. There's no competition. You know, this is, this blew my mind, although I've done this type of reporting for so long, it shouldn't surprise me. During the midterm elections, the Koch Brothers spent between 275 no, 225 and $300 million. I mean, let's just go to the lower end of that $225 million to influence the midterm elections. So crazy. It's, it's so much

Speaker 6:          02:46:10       money. It's so much money.

Speaker 2:          02:46:11       I love that they're called the Koch brothers too. I hope they do a lot of it. I hope they do it in their underwear while they're getting their toes. Dot. You know, they just are just constantly getting massaged and eaten grapes. People dangled grapes over there.

Speaker 6:          02:46:24       Very sure they, I mean, I always wonder brothers I live in like gangsters. How much money do you need? How much freaking money do you know?

Speaker 2:          02:46:32       Well obviously you don't need that 225 million just gives those stupid politicians and the politicians eat it up. They have to do is well yeah how much money do you need? And but I think it's also their professional players of the game that has made them incredibly successful. Yup. They're the baddest motherfucking monopoly players on earth. You know, they figured out a way to do it at a very high stakes. I'm sure it's insanely addictive.

Speaker 6:          02:46:54       They don't want to let it go. No, I'm sure it is addictive as well. And you know, first of all they're terrible people so don't think that I'm excusing them but dare you. But I will also say, I will also say that if the system is set up as such, why wouldn't you take advantage of it?

Speaker 2:          02:47:11       Because you're nice cause your ethical cause you realize you're a temporary life forms sharing time with these other people and she'd tried to make the world the best possible. You have the best possible influence on it that you can. Yeah. That's not the best possible influence on it and it's not the best beneficial if fill it for you. It's not that beneficial because you've already reached this point of diminishing returns where you got enough money to donate $225 million. Whoa. Do you like fly fishing? Because you should do that with your day. If you could. You imagine, I would never even think about working in a bank if I had, if I had enough money where I could give someone $225 million to, you know, fix whatever fucking laws or make it so yeah. You know, whatever the fuck.

Speaker 6:          02:47:56       Damn again, still sit in my favor. My God. I would be, I would, I would be like tuna fishing. I would get a jet ski that goes a hundred miles an hour. It'd be having fun. Why would you, why would you want to be involved? You're like 80 what are you doing? How much more money can you like enjoy? I don't understand it at all. I mean, what's the point of building this kind of wealth if you don't actually use it? And I'm sure they enjoy it in some ways, but they also spend a sizable chunk of their lives destroying the country.

Speaker 2:          02:48:26       I think there's also a momentum behind it, like a successful mantram almost akin to what you were describing. When you see other people that are more successful and even though you get inspired by it, some people may not like that thing that drives you to worry about your success level, which is very high for, would you say you're 28 yeah, very high for 28 year old woman. You've been on a very successful new show for many years now. You're very respected. You do these conversations with people online. They're very well received, but yet you still will trip about like what you've done and what you haven't done well. I guess when you're like a super fucking crazy billionaire, maybe you want to be like Dracula or some of them, you know? Maybe you want to have a hoard of slaves that bow before you and you're just waiting for you to have enough money to buy some technology that turns the world and the fucking goblins that are at your command or something. I don't fucking know. I'm not exactly sure if I get that kind of motivation. You know, like $100 billion motivation or toward 10 billion. All your woe to doing.

Speaker 1:          02:49:28       What'd you doing? I don't know. I don't understand it either. And you know, like earlier in the show I talked about how I questioned whether or not people are inherently good. And you know what? I think a lot of people are inherently good and we've turned you around. You, you have this was, this has been a very productive podcast. The one thing that I will say is I get a lot of pleasure out of giving back to my community because growing up here in la, there were so many things that were provided to me as someone who was kind of disadvantaged because like growing up, my parents weren't wealthy. You know, my parents were struggling, they were working class. And I had a great public education. I had, you know, access to something called healthy families, which was like an affordable form of health insurance for kids. Like all of these things were paid for by tax payers. Right. And these are the things that helped me build a life for myself and helped me become successful. And I feel like it's my obligation to give back to the community and help in any way that I can. Cause I want to see people who are maybe from a poor neighborhood grow up and be able to do what they really want to do with their lives. You know, I'm living my dream right now. I want to make sure other people have that same ability.

Speaker 2:          02:50:39       That's beautiful. I think it's really cool that you do that and I think it's really cool that you teach that in journalism course too, because I love it. Yeah, it's cool that you're doing it and you're like someone who's actually out there doing it as a Gig, you know? And then you're teaching people how to do it and do it correctly. That's about it. Yeah, it's great. That cast Berrien, we're at a time, we just sit three hours sane so fast by five by, if I didn't have to pee so hard it would have been like the last 10 minutes I'm hanging in there, but uh, okay. Uh, Twitter and a CAS baron. Is there anything you would like to promote or tell me what you got coming up?

Speaker 2:          02:51:18       Beautiful. Thank you. It was always fine. I had a great time. I had a great time doing your show too. It was really fun. Oh, oh. All right folks. That's it for now.
