Speaker 1:          00:01          Hello Freak bitches, a lot of times it's just giving people information right then and there and saying, you know, getting people riled up and excited and giving them the support to do it. So, um, we're going to do about a 40 city tour of solutions grassroots in New York state in February and March, so we'll do like three or four towns a day. Um, and I'll, I'll be doing that with Zephyr teachout who was incredibly popular candidate for governor who won 35 percent of the vote against Andrew Cuomo and his last election. Um, and the number of musical guests, I think we're going to be doing that in February and March. We'd love to do the solutions grassroots tour in California. Um, love to do it in other states. So you can go to solutions grassroots.com. You can sign up there. You go there. There are links that directly you can buy solar.

Speaker 1:          00:49          Uh, you can buy wind power, you can do all of that at a consumer level. But more importantly, what we're trying to do with solutions grassroots is get grassroots energy movement towards getting ourselves off fossil fuels. Because you know this, even though like you can map this out at Stanford and you have these great, amazing celebrities all talking about renewable energy, the people have to get it done. We have to get it done. We have to say, you know what, I don't want to buy oil and gas and coal to heat my home to power my home anymore. I don't want to do that anymore. I want to get off of it. You know? Um, some of the resources are very expensive, like buying an electric car that's out of the range for a lot of people. But getting solar on your roof actually is economic.

Speaker 1:          01:34          It makes sense. Getting a buying locally sourced wind power is possible in a lot of states. It's not in California, I don't think, but it is in New York. Stated there's a company called ethical electric that we have a link to at our website solutions. Grassroots.com. Or you can just basically say, you know what, I'm going to buy wind power instead of buying electricity from coal or oil or gas. And um, you know, you've done a huge amount right there. But the biggest thing that we've done in terms of all this stuff, New York, by stopping fracking kept the equivalent of $57 million cars off the road just by keeping that stuff in the ground there. And I think the equivalent of taking 72 coal fire power plants offline for a year, the movement is actually going to help solve these things. Um, so it's like, how do you get people together?

Speaker 1:          02:25          Well, we just get together. We have a film screening. There are a lot of great films on this stuff. We have a tour, we have a talk and you start organizing locally. I it happen. I just bought a new book that I highly recommend about dolphins called wet goddess, but it's available on Amazon. It's about a relationship because the only person in 50 shades of grey for dolphins really? Did you actually read it now? I haven't read it yet. I just got delivered today. But it's here. It's like God, it's so funny. But it's A. Yeah, I bought two of them. You can never have

Speaker 2:          03:00          too many, but I like the cover. It's just like, it's kind of like a scrapbook with adults. Why did you buy two? Why did you bite too? I just feel like it's not going to be A. I don't know. It's not going to be around for. You're holding onto it. You're going to be a hoarder for dolphin porn. What? Look at this. I mean like they used are going for $61. Yeah. See, I think there's a big mark. Oh look, this one, how has that is probably not the paper bag. That's got to be the hard copy. That's to actually get the dolphin to fuck you code the code underground about look at the spout on that Dolphin. You just buy the book and inside the book it's just directions to this place in San Diego. That's one of the weird things about people when it comes to stuff like like a dolphin

Speaker 3:          03:44          porn or something like that. You would think, well who the fuck would be into that? And then you put it online and it attracts a whole community. Next thing you know, there's a message board all filled with people that are talking about their dolphin porn and the dolphin love and their kinship. Have you heard about that? Some people, they don't want to be judged by being akin to certain animals. They feel like they're fox can, like, they feel connected to a Fox.

Speaker 2:          04:09          I, I don't, I, I can't, uh, I can sort of understand to a certain degree. I did this movie a few years ago and I had to write an elephant in it and when I was standing there with the elephant, the way the elephant was looking at me and I was looking at her, I really felt like I was like, I really love you. It, I genuinely felt like I think I have a crush on this elephant. Not in a sexual way. More like, I just want to hug you and love you. Yeah. Trainers have to fall in love with their animals a lot, so I don't understand when they beat them, I'm like stuck fucking hitting him with that spiked fucking stick.

Speaker 3:          04:44          Yeah. Yeah. There are people that believe that they are akin like, like they're somehow or another, they should have been this animal instead of a person. You know, some people think that they were born male, but they really should have been a woman. Some people think that they were born a person, but they should have been an elephant of the shit that's, that's a, that's a little mental. Is it though for you to judge people? Don't people don't understand there's a, there's a whole tumbler blog about it. Good Lord. Do they

Speaker 2:          05:15          try to manifest physically into these things?

Speaker 3:          05:19          Uh, well, some of those folks that are fluffy's are furries.

Speaker 2:          05:27          Gabriel, he's.

Speaker 3:          05:30          And he's flapping. Yeah. Some of those people. I'm sure that's what they're doing. They're wishing that they actually were some weird animal. Yeah, I think that's escapism. What do you think? I think a lot of what people do as escapism, including being into shit that everybody just accepts, like being in a dungeons and dragons, that's escapism. Being into cars play. That's escapism. Like at what point do we decide it's fucked up? Like it's okay if you want to up and reenact the civil war. Why is it fucked up? If you want to pretend you're fox, like you're not a soldier from 1800, you douchebag. Okay? You're an asshole who wishes the south one and you're putting on some ancient stuff and using a musket, right? That's what you're doing. Well, why isn't it? Why is that okay for you to pretend you were born Arrow with no internet for you to pretend that you were born in the time where there's no cars. That's okay, but it's not okay to pretend you're a fox. Hey Sam saying it's not okay to be a fox to live and let live love live and let die it yourself. Oh, did you see on the data dot? No. No.
