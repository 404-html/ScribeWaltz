Speaker 1:          00:00:00       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:00:05       All right. We're live, sir. First of all, thank you very much for coming on and really appreciate it. I've enjoyed your youtube video. I wouldn't say I've enjoyed I, I haven't enjoyed them, but I've been puzzled by them. Been puzzled by the subject and for people who have no idea what's going on. Let's sort of unpack this for them. In Canada, Canada is very different than the United States. I love Canada. I'm a giant fan of Canada. There's one place I would live outside of the US. 100 percent. It would be Canada. I love it up there. I think the people are at least 20 percent more polite than America, but you've got some weird shit going on up there and your king. What's the, what do you call him? Prime Minister Trudeau. That fella to the Castro, the Castro lover. I was just going to say that this fucking guy and people have been posting today all the atrocities that Castro committed during this regime to sort of show how proposed firing squad deaths.

Speaker 1:          00:00:57       Few thousand. How about all the different people that they executed and then sold their blood to the Viet Cong. That one, this wonderful, wonderful man. He was a wonderful man that, that fucking savage, um, Trudeau in what he represents is I think the good side of it, what he's trying to do, the trying to make a kinder, more progressive, more inclusive country, but along the way, what they're doing is they're, they're promoting what you would call online social justice warrior values and some of them are a little preposterous. You are one of the very few academics who have fought against some of these ideas that are not just being promoted but are being enforced and enforced and written into law. And one of them is about gender pronouns. Um, w when would mean by gender pronouns is not just he and she, but a whole slew of invented gender pronouns, gender pronouns that you're going to be compelled to use.

Speaker 1:          00:02:07       Yeah. You're already compelled to use. And and likely in the states to, even though people don't know it yet, certainly in New York and the employment, a EOC has already ruled on that with regards to businesses for theu , s and businesses. And I believe also landlords, I think. Yeah. So if your landlord chooses to ms dot gender you and not just mis-gender you, like if you're a transgender woman, you used to be mad. Now you're a woman and they call you a he. It's not just that like you're compelled to use how many. What is the, what are those, the number of them. Now, while there there's no standard nomenclature for the non gender or the further nonbinary types. There's many, many invented words. And which of those you're supposed to use is dependent entirely on the subjective choice of the person that you're talking with.

Speaker 1:          00:02:52       Now, most people I believe out there listening are going, what the hell are they talking about? Right now we're talking about as as 70 plus invented gender pronouns, like Zi x above zero h I r a bunch of weird ones and this is for people that don't necessarily think they're a. He or a she, so they prefer these things. On top of that, you have animal kin, which other kids, other kids himself, which was the one I thought most abusing worm self. That's for the low self esteem. Other kids. This is people that truly believe that they are in the wrong body and that they should have been born some form of animal and would like you to refer to them as this animal. Your Elf or Elf or a fairy or a Pixie Pixie. Ken. I haven't seen Pixie kid. That's a good one, but just get on. Tumbler got to get onto. Yes, absolutely. That's where it all goes down. I'm professor Peterson. What the Hell's going on? What is this?

Speaker 2:          00:04:03       Well, I think it's partly. It's partly a form of narcissism. Yes, it's. It's a. it's partly a consequence of, of the re, of the rise of the new rise again of of say Marxist doctrine. I would say it's part of postmodernism. Maybe it's postmodernism more than anything else because the postmodernists that's a philosophical. A community, let's say, believed that the entire point of human categorization is power and that dialogue between people is only a power dialogue and that there's no real reality outside of interpretation and that basically what we do is exchange interpretive viewpoints to ratchet up our dominance and status and that's that and there's no biology as an ideology and the idea of the objective world is an ideology and sciences and ideology and it's all interpretation all the way down like turtles all the way down.

Speaker 1:          00:04:57       What? What do you mean by it's all about power? Like in what way?

Speaker 2:          00:05:01       Well, imagine that, that there are groups of people who are competing in the world for resources I suppose, and that it's a zero sum game and it's every group against every other group and the reason that we engage in dialogue isn't to establish the truth or move towards some, some closer approximation of reality, but to structure this social interaction so that our group comes up on top.

Speaker 1:          00:05:28       Right? And that it. That is really what the problem is with all this is that it's not just a matter of choosing to be defined in one way, but compelling others to define you in that way.

Speaker 2:          00:05:39       The most, most awful elements of it I think is the idea that individuals should be defined in terms of their group identity at all. I mean you could argue, and this is one of these weird inversions, so characteristic of this chaotic state that we're in. When people originally started fighting against unfair discrimination and and I say unfair

Speaker 3:          00:05:58       discrimination because lots of discrimination is fair. If you discriminate against people on the basis of their competence, that's perfectly reasonable. It's unfair discrimination that that constitutes the proper battleground for people who have a more egalitarian viewpoint, but the initial idea was to eliminate the proclivity for people to be categorized according to their group identity because that was interfering with everyone's ability to view them as as competent individuals. But that got flipped probably in the seventies after the Soviet state. So self evidently was revealed as a catastrophe. That that got flipped so that the world was turned into one group against another power struggle from one group against another, and then the social justice warrior types in the lefties, even the Democratic Party started categorizing everybody according to their ethnic or sexual or racial identity and made that the canonical element of their being and that's an absolutely terrible thing to do it.

Speaker 3:          00:06:57       It leads to in the Soviet Union. When that happened, for example, when they introduced that idea along with the notion of class guilt. So for example, when the Soviets collectivize the farms, they pretty much wiped out or or raped and froze to death. All of their. All of their competent farmers, they. They called them Kulaks and they attributed class guilt to them because they were successful peasants and they define their success as oppression and theft. They killed all of them, pretty much ship them off to Siberia and frozen to death and they were the productive agriculturalists in the Soviet Union. And then in the 19 thirties in the Ukraine because of that, about 6 million Ukrainian starved to death, but the Soviets were big on collective guilt. And all of these things that you hear about now, like white privilege for example, they're there are variants of collective guilt. I, I, I pick your bloody identity, whatever it happens to be, and then I make you a guilty member of that category and then you and the rest of the guilty members of that category are judged as a, as a unit. It's absolutely it's murderous, pushed to its extreme, and we've seen that many, many times.

Speaker 1:          00:08:06       Yeah, you're oppressed or your, your, your opinions rather a suppressed and you are automatically put into this category of people who should be dismissed because of the fact that you have white privilege. You should step back and let others talk. You should step back and this is a narrative that gets repeated over and over again in a social justice warrior culture. This idea that you should just step back and let these others talk because they understand as long.

Speaker 3:          00:08:29       Yeah. And the others are always other group members, right? And somehow their, their discourses to be privileged in reverse because hypothetically, they're a member of an oppressed class. Of course, then you can multiply the numbers of oppressed

Speaker 1:          00:08:43       classes ad Nauseum, which is another part of the problem. Yeah. I like the idea is that in giving them privileged because they have been marginalized, you will balance things out and you will somehow another reverse the scale. Yeah. And that's another example

Speaker 3:          00:08:56       of the class based guilt idea. You know, it's um, it doesn't seem to me self evident that I'm to blame for slavery for example. I mean, being a Canadian, it's a slightly different situation I suppose, but the, the, the idea that as the member, as a member of a culture, that you're somehow responsible for the past sins of that culture. Let's say it, it, it's a very, very anti western ethos. It goes along with this idea of class guilt because your group membership is the most important thing. If your group at some point in the past did something reprehensible, which of course every group has done, that's for sure. Then you are de facto responsible in the present for that. How do you think we got to this point where people are repeating these patterns that were ultimately incredibly unsuccessful and dangerous and deadly in the past?

Speaker 3:          00:09:45       Like Marxism for example, like people proudly proclaim themselves as having Marxist ideology, one in five, one in five social scientists claimed to be a Marxist, kind of understand the history. Why don't you fill people in on how that went bad? Well, the estimates vary, but in the Soviet Union between 19, 19 in 1959, somewhere between 30 and 50 million people were killed in internal oppression alone. So that's pretty bad. And then, and, and in China, uh, which was operating under exactly the same principles, might have been up to 100 million killed during Mao's time. And of course my was still revered in China appallingly enough. Um, and Vietnam, Vietnam and Cambodia and wherever these ideas were implemented, Cuba, wherever these ideas were implemented, the result was absolute mayhem, absolute mayhem. And I think what happened is that the Marxist ideas are actually quite attractive if you're an intel electrical.

Speaker 3:          00:10:42       And if you're, I would say, if you're tilted towards compassion from a personality perspective, because they're based on doctrines like from, from each, according to his ability to each according to his need and the idea that you should fulfill people's needs or that society should fulfill people's needs, is on the surface of it, and attractive idea. Of course, the problem is who gets to define the needs and who gets to define the abilities and that really is a big problem and well, and then those ideas were put into practice a first in the Soviet Union. And Alexander Solzhenitsyn who wrote the Gulag archipelago, did a very lovely job of detailing, uh, in, in horrifying detail how those initial doctrines were transformed into legislation. And then how those legislation was transformed into endless genocide essentially and almost destroyed the world. Let's not forget that I'm partly with the W, partly with the help of Castro who just died.

Speaker 3:          00:11:38       Um, the, the, the doctrines when, when put into practice in, into, into actual practice were, were murdered us instantaneously. Now what happened, they're always apologists for the left in the West, especially in France, especially among the French intellectuals, especially in the late 19 sixties and then when, when all of the information about what was happening is in the Soviet Union came flooding forward and that culminated say in 19, 19, 73 wouldn't. Soldier Netter's book was published. The French intellectuals changed their tune instead of agitating on a part of the working class, which was which allied them with a murderous marxists. They switched and started talking about power and to talk about group identity. It was like a sleight of hand. The underlying pathological philosophy remained exactly the same, but the surface nomenclature changed and that became very attractive and it at the same time the Soviet Union dissolved. And so one of the problems I think we have now a perverse problem is that these Marxist ideas are very attractive to compassionate intellectuals and we don't have good, bad examples like the Soviet Union around that.

Speaker 3:          00:12:44       Everybody can point to and go, yeah, yeah, well that sounds good, but you know, what about the murderous death camps in the millions of people who are suffering. We still have North Korea, but you know, people treat North Korea like it's a joke instead of like it's an exemplar of a pathological system and, and people have no historical memory like my students and that's partly because they're taught so badly in schools is they have no idea what happened in the Soviet Union. They have absolutely no idea. They know a little bit about the Second World War maybe and of course people generally know about the Holocaust, but they have no idea what happened in the Soviet Union. So they have no idea where these ideas could lead. And, and the, and the universities and the high schools are so full of people who are radically left leaning that they're never taught any, that students are never taught any proper history.

Speaker 3:          00:13:30       You know, they're taught about the evils of capitalism and you know, I mean it's not like. It's not like any system is perfect, but there's difference between imperfect and and consciously murderous. I think one of the things that you've just said that's very important is that it's attractive to compassionate intellectuals. People that without really looking at what the potential for these, the these laws and regulations with the negative potential for them is that the, the underlying inclination to lean towards that is that you, you, you care about people and then you, you want people to be okay and yeah, when you're kind of treating them like they're your children's and, and I don't mean that in an entirely sarcastic manner. It's reasonable in some sense to treat other people like people that you love. Although it's not reasonable and in very many other ways, which is why you don't invite every stranger on the street to come and live with you in your house.

Speaker 3:          00:14:31       I mean everybody puts up boundaries and you have to do that, but. And people tend more than than we ever expected. And I've done a lot of research in my lab that people do tend to vote and think their temperament a lot more than, than anyone really realizes. And, and if you're kind and that's your highest virtue, then you tend to treat people like they're kin because that's what kind means, right? It said an extension of the word kin, but that doesn't work well in larger groups. You need other principals and so you look at something like the idea of of equity, which is equality of outcome rather than equality of opportunity. On the surface of it, it seems perfectly reasonable to say, well, if every resource isn't distributed absolutely equally to every group, then the system is unfair and on the face of it, that's a reasonable proposition, but it falls apart under minimal examination.

Speaker 3:          00:15:23       So here's something to think about for, for all, for everyone who thinks that equality of outcome is a good idea, it's like why the hell are you striving for anything? Then? Because the reason anyone strives to better themselves or to develop a skill or to move forward in life at all is to produce inequality. You're trying to rise above the mediocre masses every time you make an effort at anything. And so everything that we associate a positive movement forward to a positive motivation is actually an attempt to render the world more on equal. Now you're rendering and on we equal in adjust way, right? Because we might say, well, if you work really hard, you deserve and unequal outcome. Well yeah, unless you want people to stop working hard. And that was the old joke in the Soviet Union, you know, they pretend to pay us, we pretend to work.

Speaker 4:          00:16:19       So it's. So it's, it's, it's so thoughtless that that's, that's the problem. That is a big problem. The phrase income inequality, do you never hear effort inequality? Because the effort,

Speaker 3:          00:16:32       oh well, you know, in, in, in some on some campuses, and this is true in California, it's now considered a, a form of aggression. It's classified under the microaggression to say that hard work is the one, one of the reasons that people accumulate more, accumulate more, accumulate more value, accumulate more property, accumulate more money. It's, it's, it's an aggression. It's aggressive to say that because it implies that people who who are poor don't work hard. Now, see, that's another terribly fuzzy form of thinking because there are lots of reasons for people to not have money, many to be poor, let's say, which is even, which is even different than not having money, alcoholism, drug addiction, mental illness, physical illness, intellectual incapacity and lack of work, all of those things,

Speaker 4:          00:17:22       so environmental factors. What communities grow up into, what you're being exposed to. People imitate their atmosphere. You're around people that are constantly in trouble with the law and you're dealing with horrible environments. There's a lot of factors and I think that one of the things that's really important about having these discussions is that they, they break down these rigid ideologies that a lot of these kids that are going to these universities are sort of being shoved into their shoved into these ideology. You're either on the left or you're on the right and there's very few on the right. There's no open market of ideas when it comes to discussing these things. You're compelled and enforced into surgeon. He's a psychologist at the New York, New York University business school. He's done a really good job

Speaker 3:          00:18:09       documenting the dearth of ideological viewpoints, let's say political or temperamental viewpoints because that's more accurate in the modern university and its appalling because with along with all this push for ethnic and sexual and racial diversity, which I think is just a mask to enforce a kind of ideological homogeneity, there's no even understanding that ideational diversity is the only relevant value for for a university. The rest of it's all predicated on the assumption that if you do select people because of their ethnicity or racial background or gender, that that will in and of itself produce diversity of ideas, which is another really pernicious idea because it assumes that and it's so contradictory. The left describes anything that's associated with the assumption that someone who's female for example, will think in a female way. They regard that as an unreasonable prejudice. You have to perfectly reasonable to say that we need more women in x discipline because they will bring in female ideas.

Speaker 3:          00:19:17       It's like, well, what? What? What? What the hell are female ideas? You can't have it both ways unless you're completely in, unless you don't care at all about coherence or consistency and ideologues really don't because they care about putting their ideology fourth, but the idea that you're going to get a diversity of ideas because you have a diversity of of class of people, assumes that ideas and identity are the same thing and that's an absurd proposition. In fact, that's that's. That's an essentially racial racist proposition. Black people think differently than white people. It's no some do and some don't, and the overlap is substantive than the difference between the individuals is far greater than the difference between the group.

Speaker 4:          00:20:03       I think we also need to make a very clear distinction between discrimination and people that are just inclined to gravitate towards different careers and different focuses. There is a big difference between women being forced out of tech and women being not as compelled to enter into tech careers as men, but we're well that, that, that,

Speaker 3:          00:20:22       that tech, the tech issue is a really interesting one for a couple of reasons. One is that of course, high tech basically developed after the playing field for men and women was more or less level, I mean that happened in the 19 seventies and despite that there weren't any near anywhere near as many women in tech. There's far more women in caring professions and you see that particularly in Scandinavia where they've done everything they can to equal to equalize the playing. It's 20 to one female to male nurses and 20 to one male to female engineers.

Speaker 4:          00:20:53       Matt, if you could the Scandinavian issue because it's very interesting.

Speaker 3:          00:20:56       Yeah, that's done over there and what the results of them. Yeah. Well imagine that. There are two reasons that people differ there. There are more than two, but just imagine for the time being that there are two. One is for environmental reasons, cultural reasons, and the other is for biological reasons. What happens if you flatten out the environmental reasons, which is what's happened in Scandinavia is you maximize the biological differences. You don't get rid of them, you maximize them. And so what's happened in Scandinavia is that men and women are more different from a temperament, personality perspective, and also in terms of their interests. They're more different in scandinavia than they are anywhere else in the world. Now, what have they done to try to flatten things out? As you say? Well, they've transformed their social policy so that men and women have as close to equal opportunity say, as any society has managed, but that hasn't produced the hope for equality of outcome.

Speaker 3:          00:21:45       Quite quite the contrary in many situations. It's exaggerated it and you could say that, that that's actually okay. Is that what you want? What you want is to have a society where the genuine differences between people are free to manifest themselves. So for example, if you, if you have three or four kids, say the kids are going to be a different from one another genetically, that's why they're not identical twins. They differ genetically and if you set the environment up so that each child is supportive, that children actually turned out quite differently. Now, if you're an absolute brute and you beat them and you abused them, then they'll all turn out the same because there's tremendous environmental influence on them then, but if you, if you form an individual relationship with each of them and allow their strengths to manifest themselves as they will in, in a, in a supportive environment, and the kids are going to turn out very different and so a free society is actually one that that produces massively unequal outcomes because it allows the genuine differences between people to manifest themselves.

Speaker 3:          00:22:44       These people who are pushing equity at, which is equality of outcome. That's what the word equity codes for. By the way, equality of outcome and not equality of opportunity. I don't know what in the world they do with regards to the fact that a very large number of professions are high quality, high, high paid professions are female dominated physicians, for example, psychologists, um, any, any of the disciplines that have to do with human care almost inevitably dominated by women. And that's increasingly the case is that we're supposed to stop that. Is that also a sign of oppression? We're going to force women to do things they're not interested in.

Speaker 4:          00:23:19       Well, there's also a very disingenuous way of framing it here in America where people consistently, even the president of United States, Obama was talking about income inequality and the way they frame income inequality. They talk about the seventy nine cents to the dollar, but what they don't discuss that we're talking about completely different careers. We're not. The way they frame it, they frame it as if two people are working side by side. One is a man, one is a woman. They're both doing the same job. The man makes a dollar. The woman who makes seventy nine cents, that is not the case. It's typical of ideological

Speaker 2:          00:23:46       conversation because what happens technically, like imagine that a given. We talked about poverty a few minutes ago and you said, well, there's, there's many, many reasons that one person might have more money than another. Um, there are many, many reasons why women might make less money on average than men. There. There are small businesses that women run, for example, make far less money than men's, the small businesses that men run. But that's partly because a lot of women run their businesses part time because they have kids. It's also partly because men do all the horrible, dangerous jobs, the ones where there's a high chance of dying, men are much more likely to work outside. Um, men are much more likely to move in, in pursuit of a career opportunity. There are lots of reasons that, that men and women differ in terms of their income. But if you're an idiot log, you can only handle one variable. Oh, men and women measured on mass don't have the same incomes. Therefore the system is corrupt. Jesus, how much thinking does it take to come up with a, with a theoretical scenario like that? So boneheaded and it just runs, it just pushes the ideological, uh, it just pushes the ideology forward with no thought.

Speaker 1:          00:24:57       Now, as a professor, why is this sort of objective reasoning and really absolutely honest assessment of this situation? Why is it so rare amongst professors? Why is it so rare in universities? Why is this such an unusual subject? Well, I think the reason is is that when, when people first encounter a complex topic like income differences,

Speaker 2:          00:25:25       it's like imagine you were drawing a map of the territory and you don't know the territory very well. The first thing you do is just roughly sketch out the shapes of the continence and maybe you're wrong. Like the early European maps of North America, you know, you kind of get one coastline, right? Guests and the rest it's blurry and gray and then as you investigate more and more, your picture of the situation becomes higher and higher and higher and higher resolution. It's hard to go from a low resolution representation to a high resolution. Representation and ideologies are low resolution representations. So the thing about a low resolution representations is it looks like it covers everything, but it doesn't. The closer you look, the more details there are. You know, if you get a three year old to draw a helicopter, they put like a little cross on the top and a circle in a stick and another circle. And that's the helicopter. Well, you know, when you look at it, that's a helicopter, but no one would expect that thing to fly. If you want to change that into a real model of a helicopter, you have to increase your focus and concentration on every single element of the entity and that takes a tremendous amount of cognitive effort and sometimes you don't even know what you don't know about something. You know? I could say, well, there are 50 reasons why men and women's income differ. Well, that doesn't mean I can all

Speaker 3:          00:26:44       50 of those differences in each of those 50 differences are fragmented into maybe another dozen categories each. Maybe there's 600 reasons why men and women's salary differ, but you have to spend a tremendous amount of time paying attention and thinking to build your model of reality into that level of resolution. And basically what you do is default to temperamentally, I'm influenced ideologies. They give you a one bit answer to everything. Why are men and women? Why do men and women's salaries different oppression? It's always the same thing and it makes. It makes you feel like you know something and people like that because they don't like the I the feeling that there's something they don't know, they don't like to be in chaos. That's basically chaos. They like to be an order. An order is where you know everything so and professors are no different, no different than than than people obviously. Given that there are people, maybe they're more intelligent on average. They're also more sheltered, I would say in many ways on average and they're also not challenged as often tenure,

Speaker 4:          00:27:51       10 years in issue and also not competing in the marketplace, not being in the workforce, going from being in high school to being in universities, to getting a degree to teaching, to being a professor, to getting tenured, staying inside of that intellectual bubble.

Speaker 3:          00:28:06       Yeah. Well it's complicated. Often these things, these things happen. They're like positive feedback loops. You know, when you bring a speaker too close to her microphone, too close to a speaker and it starts to howl and I think something like that's happened in the universities is that they started to tilt towards the left in the sixties and then as they tilted they tilted harder and as they tilled it harder, they tilt it even harder until all of the diversity was forced out of the universities and I don't know if it's so much a consequence of the actual policies of the university as, as just a feedback process that got out of control. I mean if it's 50 percent liberals and 50 percent conservatives, no, no problem. But if it's 70 percent liberals and 30 percent conservatives, maybe it rapidly goes to 99 percent liberals and one percent conservatives.

Speaker 3:          00:28:51       Is that what it's like right now? I mean, what is it when you look at the University of Toronto, where you are, what, what is the number? If you had to guess? Well, it would depend to some degree on the discipline, but, but, but professors are also also tend to be characterized by personality traits that do tilt them towards liberalism. They're higher in trait openness, which is both creativity and interest in ideas. That's one of the things that temperamentally distinguishes liberals from conservatives. Conservatives are more conscientious, they're more orderly and industrious liberals are more open, so they're more interested in aesthetics and ideas and of course being interested in this statics and ideas does tilt you towards an academic career. Um, it's hard to tell. I mean it certainly the bulk of the bulk of intellectuals are, are liberal and liberal, left virtually all of them I would say.

Speaker 3:          00:29:41       And then that's probably not, that's not as true. We know this is not as true in the hard sciences, but in the social sciences and the humanities, it's the overwhelming majority. I mean, I could see that even in this, in this battle that I've been in Canada with regards to bill [inaudible] in these compelled pronouns that almost no support from my faculty colleagues now. I didn't expect any. I mean, and I'm not shocked by that, but, but it's an indication that if you put to them a choice between social justice slash all consuming compassion and freedom of expression, they're going to tilt hard towards the, the social justice compassion end of things. It almost seemed like when I was watching some of the debates that you've engaged in, it almost seems like they're politicians. Some seems like they, their wedding, their finger and going with the breeze.

Speaker 3:          00:30:27       There's some conversations that you had that were just. I had to stop and rewind them because I couldn't believe the arguments. There was a woman, I don't know it was. Was it a transgender man that you were having a discussion with that was saying that there's no difference? No biological difference in the sexist, new biological difference. He said that the scientific consensus for the last court date, I'm not sure. I'm not. I don't believe so. He, he was a professor who taught transgender studies at the University of Toronto and yeah, and he said outright that there were no biological differences between men and women and that that was the scientific consensus. And he and he believed that he had the qualifications to say that because he was a historian of medicine, which, which hardly qualifies as scientists, not that you have to be a scientist to notice that there are biological differences between men and women.

Speaker 3:          00:31:17       It was very bizarre for me at that at that point in this in the last few months because I was under substantial pressure from the university to stop repeating my claim, that I wouldn't use compelled pronouns to refer to people because the university regarded that is against the university policies and also against the Ontario Human Rights Code. So also illegal and as my employers, they're responsible for everything. I say whether or not there has been a complaint made, whether or not the consequence of my speeches intended or unintended because that's built into the legislation and believe me, that's coming your way because this legislation spreads like mad, but on the one hand I was. I got two letters of warning from the university for refusing to use these compelled pronouns, which I regard as the ideological constructions of radical left wingers and this professor went on the agenda. This is Ontario new show and announced publicly that there are no biological differences between men and women. It was like, Huh. You think maybe the university would have had something to say about that since they do in fact have a biology department, but. Oh No. That, that, that went by without notice. That was perfectly fine. Is saying it's such an insane thing to say if there's no biological difference than why they taking hormones. Well, that's a good question. Why bother with the surgery and the horror? Especially the hormones. Yeah, because that's not like you could argue with surgery that that's cosmetic, right? This person, whoever this professor

Speaker 1:          00:32:40       was as a expert in transgender studies, Nicholas, Matt, um, I'm pretty sure that used to be a woman or she, they. You're not allowed to say that if you say that you're a bad person, if you say they and they in them is the most reasonable of these, a pronoun, these alternative pronouns, they and them, like you could say, if you know a guy and he does know how to swim, they should probably stay out of the pool. Right? Right. You can say that you could use that in a non polar will form. Yes, and they is used to repair awkward sentences basically, but it's never been used despite the claims of the of the gender bender activists. It's never been used for the singular and we shouldn't. We shouldn't, we shouldn't, we shouldn't. All just language. We don't give up the distinction between the plural news segment or now.

Speaker 1:          00:33:28       It's certainly need to know whether it's one person or more than one person. Do you think it's reasonable for people that are asexual people that really are uncomfortable with the idea of being a man or a woman? Is it reasonable that we come up with a distinction for that? I mean that seems like it would be nice and this is one of the things that you've said, one of the, one of the things that you don't like about this, that you're being compelled to use these made up pronouns and that if we as a society, as a culture, as a civilization, sort of adopt a new phrase that you would. That one we had transexual were. Yeah, but I know. I know that's problematic because it's not asexual. Transexual would be transitioned and here's the other distinction. This is another important thing. Those aren't the people that have the problem with it.

Speaker 1:          00:34:14       The people that have the problem with these pronouns, the transsexual community almost entirely, or at least I shouldn't say entirely, but predominantly prefer the alternative pronoun. A male to female transgender person prefers to be called a woman or she and use the female pronouns and male opponents. Yes. Yeah, so there's some tinies abolition of the Trans Sexual Community, or we could say there's some tiny fraction of people who are identifying themselves with the transgender community, which is already a tiny fraction. Who claims that they have an identity that doesn't fit into either binary category. Well, it's a proposition that I think bears some scrutiny to begin with because I don't believe that the claims that that tiny community is making our coherent in any sense because they say, well, you could be man woman or neither or both. It's, it's, it's those aren't coherent claims in my estimation, and if what they're saying is, if we don't fit into a category and therefore we get to invent our own plurality of categories, it's not logically tenable that isn't how it works because you get an infinite number of categories out of that. And that's what's happening already online. One of my favorite stories came out of, uh, an all girls university in Massachusetts where a group of women where they were trying to pick a president of the student body or whatever.

Speaker 4:          00:35:38       And uh, one of the girls who went to that school decided that she identified as a man. So she changed her name and I don't believe there was any hormones or anything involved. I think she just changed her name. She called herself masculine of center, Gender Queer, changed your name to a masculine name, ran for president of whatever the hell this is. I think it was willingly. Yes, I believe you're right. One and then was denounced by the rest of the class because now she was a white male. So she was a part of the patriarchy and she was a part of the whole problem with society and that she should not be allowed or he should not be allowed to take that position, which I just, I. that's a really good example. We read it on air and I couldn't stop laughing. Right. Well that's good.

Speaker 3:          00:36:23       That's a really good example of the chaos that ensues when you start to blow apart standard categories. There's a chaos in between categories that that's made of a, of an infinite multiplicity. That's why you see two with the lgbt rainbow. They're getting caught in their own metaphor. So there's an infinite number of gradations in a rainbow and there's an infinite number of letters that are accumulating on the lgbt rainbow and there's an element of clear absurdity to that. And one of them is, I believe it's q plus that includes the other kin types. It's like, well, the claim is, well, I'm marginalized, and then that sort of becomes normalized. And then there's a group right outside of that that says, well, I'm marginalized to. And another group says, well, I'm, here I am. I'm also marginalized and there's absolutely no logic. Once you've identified yourself as marginalized, there's no logical way that you can exclude anyone else who regard themselves as marginalized and so the marginalized, the, the, the community of the marginalized expands and expands and expands and expands.

Speaker 3:          00:37:29       And part of the reason for that is that people are, every individual is a multiplicity and there's an element to every individual that's marginalized, you know, so for example, it's clearly the case that when a child is socialized, there's pros and cons to that. The pros are the socialization turns the little beastly two year old into a four year old that other children can play with and that that does happen between the ages of two and four. If a child is socialized properly, then then what the child does is kind of turned into a clone of everyone else so that he or she can benefit from being able to interact with everyone else. Now that that builds up a certain amount of individuality because kids learn to talk and they learned to play and all that, and it destroys a certain amount of individuality. So everybody sacrifices a certain portion of their peculiarity to become a socialized creature and some of that's good and some of it's bad and we know that that's.

Speaker 3:          00:38:28       That's the standard story of the rebellious Adolescent Against Society for crushing their individuality. Right? And there's, there's some, there's an element of that that's true, but by the same token, if you don't sacrifice a certain amount of your individuality to the group, there's no such thing as society. Everybody has to live on their own. Everyone is in their own subjective bubble, which is of course now required by this law and society itself breaks down and so you can't have a society without marginalizing people or you can't have a society without making everyone part of everyone marginalized. And so then when you start to concentrate on the marginalized, it just grows and expands and grows and expands and grows and expand until everyone becomes marginalized. And that just highlights a real problem with quote mining that is going to take that you can't have a society without marginalizing people quote and put it under Dr Jordan Peterson.

Speaker 3:          00:39:28       This is what he believes. Well, that's actually what Jacques Derrida's said that the, the, the, the most famous of the postmodernists, that, that's why derrick is such a, uh, invasive force. He said, well, you can't have a society without marginalizing. It's like, well, that's true. It's true comma, but dot, dot, dot. Right. But the fact that you can't have a society without marginalizing doesn't mean that you shouldn't have a society. And it doesn't mean that the only reason that society exists is to marginalize. And that was at his claim that that's what makes him so he's absolutely pathological to the core. Jacques Derrida, and, and apart from his claims that all we do is trade power games because that's another one of his claims. His other claim is that the purpose of categorization, the purchase purpose of society is to marginalize. And that's absolutely absurd. The purpose is so that we can all play a moderately mediocre but productive, homogenous social game.

Speaker 3:          00:40:29       Is it perfect? Well, obviously not. Does it require the sacrifice of individuality? Yes. Is some of that sacrificed individuality valuable? Absolutely. What's the alternative? No society. While I don't think so, that doesn't seem like a very good alternative to me or maybe some sort of egalitarian utopia. Well yeah, we had 100 years of that and 100 million deaths as a consequence and so maybe not that either. What we have right now is a flawed system, but it's the best flawed system that anybody's ever come up with and of course it marginalizes people. How could it not? You know, if, if kids organize themselves in a playground to play hide and go seek, they've marginalized all the kids that wanted to play tag obviously, but that doesn't mean that they shouldn't come to a consensus and go ahead and play a game. At least they're bloody while playing a game that, that you know, pretty much everybody has access to. I think marginalized is a lot of times associated with oppression that the term marginalized

Speaker 4:          00:41:34       and it's not necessarily the case and I think that society as a whole and civilization is sort of a work in progress. We're, we're working all this out and that's one of the beautiful things about you being able to discuss these things on your youtube page as opposed to just having to battle it out inside the echo chamber of the universities. You're able to express this stuff out in the world where people like me that a 49 years old and aren't in college have a chance to read this and see like, wow, what is this guy going through over there at the University of Toronto? And then you start to examine the laws and you start to look at what's going on here and this egalitarianism utopia idea. It's beautiful and it's concept that we should all be able to get along and everything should be equal. The problem is it defies human nature.

Speaker 4:          00:42:20       It defies the 200, 300,000 years of DNA that we have bouncing around inside of our bodies that demand certain types of behavior and I think it's so important that we discuss these things and I think that society and civilization as a whole, this, this thing that is ultimately in this growing state, this constant state of improvement. And, and, and objective interaction, I mean, there has to be some sort of discussion. One of the problems that I have with the soda, so called Social Justice warriors and what this movement is that they're in forcing a certain type of thinking and behavior and their incredibly aggressive about it. Hence the

Speaker 2:          00:43:06       warrior term. Yeah. Well, I think, I think a fair bit of that is grounded again in temperament, which is quite comical. I mean, one of the things that our research indicated research on political correctness indicated that his trait, agreeableness is a good predictor of holding politically correct views and also that being female is a good predictor of holding politically correct views. And I think part of the reason for that and, and the warrior aspect to it too, is that agreeableness is a maternal instinct trait, roughly speaking. And you know, human beings have very powerful maternal instincts. That's true for women and for men because men are very involved. Male human beings are very involved in the raising of their children, which makes them quite different than, than many large animals. Um, on the one hand, if you're a very maternal, you're very compassionate and protective of those that are within your kin boundary and you can try to include more people in that if you want. And, and that's, that's the political goal, but you're unbelievably hostile to anyone who's outside of that that you regard as a threat slash predator. And so agreeableness, agreeableness makes you divide the world up into protected children and Predator and predators

Speaker 4:          00:44:20       and you see that on social justice warriors twitter pages. I mean, I follow a bunch of them and I go to them and I watched this ain't incredibly supportive to ridiculously so in terms of like many

Speaker 3:          00:44:32       mediocre expressions tweets, oh my God, it's so brilliant. And it's like you're saying almost nothing. There's so incredibly supportive of the people that think along their lines and so incredibly hostile. And this, uh, this idea of shaming people that don't agree with them not interacting with them, but almost immediately insulting them, almost immediately marginalized. And then, which is ironic, this is what you see constantly, is like super supportive and super aggressive against people that have any sort of an opposing viewpoint. Well, they're all predators, the ones that have an opposing viewpoint and that's how they define them. It's one of the things that's very comical about this from my perspective, is that it's such sex stereotypical behavior. Is that at the same time that the social justice warriors are denouncing, the idea that, um, psychology for example, might have anything to do with sex differences.

Speaker 3:          00:45:23       They're acting out sex stereotype behavior like mad in terms of their persecution of predators and their protection of the, of the Qin Qin slash ingroup. So, and you're, you are a, a social psychologist. No, no, no, I'm not. I'm a clinical personality psychologist. And what is the difference? Well, one of the differences is that personality and so and clinical psychology isn't a corrupt enterprise. Whereas social psychology fundamentally is, it's been going through an absolute internal revolution over the last two years because of all, because of its own discovery that many of its fundamental studies in propositions are flawed. I would say social psychology is the most social justice slash left leaning part of psychology and its methods are generally appalling there. They're not well documented and they produce all sorts of categories that don't exist. Whereas personality, I know it seems like it might seem like trivial distinction to people outside of the field, but that these disciplines are quite separate from a historical perspective.

Speaker 3:          00:46:25       They developed quite separately. Personality psychologists are very, very careful about defining what they measure. And so for example, I studied the big five personality traits. That's extroversion, neuroticism, agreeableness, conscientiousness, openness, um, and under openness falls, intelligence, these are very well documented. We can really measure them, we can't measure them as well as we would like to. We've identified the biological basis for most of the traits and we understand a fair bit about how they make people different. And um, and, and personality psychologists have been very, very careful about measurement were social psychologists are, as a general rule, very, very cavalier about their, about their concepts. And that's led to a tremendous pollution, I would say, of the psychological literature. The implicit association test is a good example of that. That's the test that's being used to assess people's unconscious biases, unconscious racial biases, and so for example, if, if I showed you a bunch of pictures of black people in a bunch of photographs of white people and then I asked you to associate a good or a bad word with the black people are the white people to respond after you've seen the picture.

Speaker 3:          00:47:37       If you are white and you saw white photos, you'd be faster at responding to the to the positive words and so they've used that as evidence of racism. But part of the problem with that is that you can't distinguish it from a novelty response. So I mean most people in a given racial group are far more familiar with members of their racial group and the fact that they're more likely to associate negative things with racial groups that are outside of their racial group isn't something that can be easily distinguished from just a novelty effect. But they make wide ranging claims about the inbuilt biases in people and also. And that's lent. And that's lent a impetus to these movements that are racing through corporations across the United States and governmental agencies where people are being subjected to mandatory unconscious racial bias retraining. And there's no evidence by the way, that, that works at all.

Speaker 3:          00:48:32       In fact, the evidence that there is suggest quite the contrary. I saw this on one of your videos. Um, you were, you were discussing how preposterous this is on one of your videos because one of the people that was opposing you was actually a part of something like this, right? Yeah. Well, the human resources and equity people at the University of Toronto have made mandatory unconscious racism training, anti bias training, and they've made it mandatory for their staff. And I found that absolutely appalling. First of all, it's political. It's political reeducation. So when you say, but mandatory like this is something that, you know, I didn't have to because I'm not a, I'm not part of the human resources staff, but the people that they're consulting with to implement these sorts of programs certainly have faculty and students in their sites. I mean, these are, these are trial runs for much broader, uh, rolling out of exactly this sort of, of exactly this sort of a reeducation.

Speaker 3:          00:49:25       What's the methodology behind it and how has this been, has been vetted? Oh, I don't think it's been vetted at all. The like if you're going to, let's say you want to put in, in, into practice and educational process, what you need to do is you need to measure the initial state validly so that your measure, so you need to use multiple measures and all those measures need to say the same thing. So if you're going to accuse someone of racism, you need several different measures of racism and then you have to show that across all the measures. So like using different meters, all the meters should read the same thing. Then you have to implement your educational intervention carefully defined. Then you have to, do, you have to see afterwards if the consequence of the educational effort was a reduction in those initial, uh, indices, those additional measures, that sort of thing when it's been done at all, has showed that educational interventions of that sort that are mandatory actually make racism and bias worse rather than better.

Speaker 3:          00:50:25       But why let a few facts stop you because we already know from the postmodernists that there's no such thing as facts anyways. So there's skin Canada here. Here's something is one of the things that really makes me proud of my country. Our government has now announced that the judiciary in Canada will be selected. If you're going to be a candidate to be a judge, you have to produce a dossier that specifies your, your identities, whatever they happen to be racial, ethnic, religious, and then you, the committee that's going to appoint you to the judiciary has to have undergone mandatory anti racism and bias training before they're allowed to serve on the committee. So basically we've set up a situation in Canada. Where are the people who select their judges have to go a kind of indoctrination that has no validity from a scientific perspective before they're allowed to select our judges.

Speaker 3:          00:51:20       Now who's enforcing this where to justice minister, but where justice minister, where did this program come from? All sorts of people who have, who are, who are offering these programs now and so we've come a growth industry, but what is their qualifications? That's a good question, right? Qualifications, zero browser rains. Yeah. Well there's just no way of having qualifications for doing this sort of thing because it's not a valid procedure. So how does he claim to be qualified? So they claim to be qualified. They come to the university and they say, I have a solution. The university says finally just run with it. And they just implemented because to question anything that would absolve. Racism is racist. Yes, right? Yes. And they did that in collaboration with the black liberation collective, which is police that one because that, that one's adorable. The black liberation collective isn't that?

Speaker 3:          00:52:09       Isn't that the group that somehow things that white people are inferior because they don't have enough melanin, so it was started by a woman who said exactly that she's a black supremacist and she said that the reason that the reason that white people are inferior because they don't have enough melanin in their skin and Melanin apparently is this agent. It's obviously it's a pigment, but it's apparently this agent that transforms cosmic energy into wisdom mean she's completely. You can make. You can make up your own mind about her. And then the other person who started the black liberation collective is a woman who used to work for the University of Toronto Students Union who is now being pursued by that student's Union for embezzling $300,000 of from, from, from that organization with the help of a couple of her cronies. Well, why let a few facts stand in the way of abolishing racism?

Speaker 3:          00:52:58       Yeah. Well, they also. They also are perfectly willing to promote violent means of social transformation and the university claims that it's in favor of safety, you know, because they've gone after me because my refusal to use compelled pronouns is apparently made the campus unsafe, but they're perfectly willing to take advice from the black liberation collective and not only are they willing to take advice from them and not disavow them despite their support for violent means of of social revolution. They're also pushing equality of outcome on their employees and the people who taught there mandatory anti racism and anti bias training program said outright in their training material, which I have copies of that any institution that doesn't have equality of outcome as as part of its characteristic at every level of the power organization is corrupt and should be restructured.

Speaker 3:          00:53:50       But that pales in comparison to my refusal to use compelled pronouns. Like obviously don't understand how this gets so far. I just don't understand how no one has. There's no rational thinking involved in the administration and the and the people that are implementing these ideas. I just don't understand how it gets to the point where things get too terrible places. One tiny step at a time. You know, if I encroach I, if I encroach on you and I'm sophisticated about it, I'm going to encroach two millimeters. I'm going to encroach right to the point where you start, start to protest, then I'm going to stop, then I'm going to wait. Then you're going to calm down. Then I'm going to encroach again, right to the point where you protest. Then I'm going to stop, then I'm going to wait, and I'm just going to do that forever.

Speaker 3:          00:54:34       And before you know it, you're going to be back three miles from where you started and you'll have done it one step at a time and then you'll go, oh, how'd I get here? And the answer was, well, I pushed you a little farther than you should have gone, and you agreed, and so then I pushed you a little farther than you should've gone again. And you agreed, and if anybody's interested in this sort of process, and this is a horrifying book, if you want to read about how this process works, you can read a book called ordinary men by Robert Browning in ordinary men is about browning, was interested in how the Nazis trained. They're there, they're there, they how they train people to kill basically. And so Robert Browning studied this police battalion. It's very interesting book. So these were middle aged German men. So they, they were, they were raised and educated really before Hitler came to power.

Speaker 3:          00:55:23       So they weren't indoctrinated Nazis, they were policemen and when the Nazis went through Poland and then and then needed to impose their brand of order on Poland, they brought policemen and they brought this battalion of middle aged policemen in and they're commandant. Their commander was by all accounts, a pretty decent guy. And he told them that because it was war time, they were probably going to have to do some pretty terrible things, but that they could go home if they didn't think they were up to it. So there was no compulsion. You know, this wasn't a milgrim experiment or or an experiment where you had to obey orders. The guy who was giving the artist said, look, this is going to be awful, but you can back off, but the guys thought, well, I'm not going to leave my comrades here to do the dirty work, you know, which is kind of a virtue in in a perverse way.

Speaker 3:          00:56:09       And then Browning details how they went from ordinary policeman to guys who were taking naked pregnant women out into the middle of fields and shooting them in the back of their head and they were physically ill during most of the transformation process. You know, they started out by what? Rounding up the Jewish men between the ages of 16 and 65, while you know, you can kind of understand that because you're at war and then, well then they put them in stadiums and then, well then they had to shoot some of them. Then they had to load them on cattle cars. It was like one step at a time. These guys were having a dreadful time of it. They didn't stop. They didn't stop. And so that's how things get to where they are now, is that, I mean, I know they're not at that point and I'm not trying to make the case that they're at that point.

Speaker 3:          00:56:49       Well, you're one of the first people that sounding an alarm that there's, there's a real issue with controlling people. There's a real issue with controlling dialogue, controlling the way people communicate and that these ideologies, although seemingly innocuous, they can take you down very dangerous roads. Yes. Well, seemingly innocuous ideology, those words, innocuous ideology, those words do not go together. There are no innocuous ideologies. And there are forms of pathological oversimplification and there are also clubs. I mean, I mean the kind of clubs that you hit people with as well as the clubs that you belong to. The advantage to me being an idiot log is that I can explain everything. I can feel morally superior and I know who my enemies are. And you know what you're supposed to do with enemies. They're not your friends, right? You move against them. And you know, we're approaching a situation, and this has already happened, I think more in the United States than in Canada, although our countries are competing to see who can cross the idiot line fastest.

Speaker 3:          00:57:49       You're, you're in a situation in the US where 50 percent of your population won't talk to the other 50 percent. That's not good. And I would say it's more pronounced on the left liberal side because they regard everybody who voted for trump as essentially as an enemy. It's like, hey people, that's 50 percent of your citizens. You might think about talking with them. You know, people you can't talk to. Those are enemies. My ironically, I really truly believe that one of the big factors in trump's rise to power is that people are sick of this oversimplification in this ridiculous ideology coming from the left like that. This combined entity politic. Exactly. And so they've chosen an identity politics that opposes the identity politics that they think is disgusting. Yeah. And that's just starting. It's just just start. That's right. Well, if you teach, if you teach one side to play identity politics, defacto, you teach the other side to play identity politics, and I've seen more and more people who are center people as far as I'm concerned, pushed to the right because of the continual insistence that by their mere existence, they're part of the perpetrator group just by being a white person who is somehow or another successful.

Speaker 3:          00:59:01       You are a privileged person. You're part of the elite. You're part of the one percent. You're a part of the problem. Yeah. You're part of the oppressors. Yeah, absolutely. Or an oppressor by being just to just by a person with a home in the suburbs. Well, and it's also extremely annoying for people who've worked really hard and who've made the requisite sacrifices to become along some

Speaker 2:          00:59:22       dimension, to have that immediately attributed to their oppression and it's not. It's not obvious that that's something we want to do. It's like for the social justice warrior types out there who might be listening, it's like, do you. Are you really willing to say that every single person who's accomplished something as done that as a consequence of oppression, that that's again what the Soviets claimed with regards to the to the successful peasants in the 19, in the just before the 19 twenties. It's like, well, the peasants weren't emancipated. They were serfs until about 30 years before that they were serfs. They were basically slaves and some of them had clambered up to the point where maybe they could have owned their hot and a cow and you don't employ somewhat. While the Soviet claim was, well, that's all theft. You got that all because you're an oppressor.

Speaker 2:          01:00:07       And so then the Soviet intellectuals went into the villages and just imagine how this happened. So imagine a village, small town where everyone knows everybody and there's maybe 10, 20 people there who are moderately successful. Okay? And so you can imagine that those 20 people have like a 100 enemies at the bottom of the socioeconomic distribution. Useless, horrible. People who are jealous and resentful about the fact that these people have been successful. Okay? So now the intellectuals come in and say property is theft, success is oppression, and then they looked for the people in the village who are willing to move against those 20 successful people. Well those guys at the bottom, those hundred resentful, jealous, murderous people at the bottom there just waiting for an opportunity to go kick down some doors. And that's exactly what they did in the 19 twenties. And as I said, they wiped out all their productive peasants and then 6 million Ukrainian starve to death. They had posters. The Soviets produced posters in the 19 thirties that said essentially, um, don't forget it's wrong to eat your children.

Speaker 2:          01:01:09       So whoa. Yeah, whoa. There's nothing about the Soviet, there's nothing that you can imagine that's horrible enough so that it matched the reality of what happened in the Soviet Union between 19, 19 in 1959. And you know, the West knew about this too early. Malcolm Muggeridge in the thirties was documenting for, for England, for, for English newspapers, exactly what was going on in the Soviet Union. The bloody intellectuals didn't admit it until the mid seventies, you know, with the exception of people like George Orwell. So why do these patterns repeat themselves? What is it about human beings? Well, we like things simple. We like things simple. So say you often like a simple explanation is a good explanation unless it's too simple. But distinguishing between simple and too simple is no easy matter. We like, we like to know who's our friend and our enemy and we liked the feeling of unearned moral superiority and moral standard yard.

Speaker 2:          01:02:10       Yeah, that's, that's the challenge. Especially when there's no such thing as earning anyways. So, and then, I mean there's deeper and darker things that are underneath that. So like the, the human proclivity to pull down those who have more than you. It's like these kids on the campuses who are claiming identity with the oppressed, you know, somewhere like Yale. It's like how in the world you can speak of oppression if you happen to be at Yale is beyond me. I mean, first of all, your North American, which puts you in the top one percent, and then of North Americans, you're in the top one percent, the top one percent of one percent, but yet you want that, you want to have all the power that goes along with that and you want to have the moral superiority that comes from being a representative of the oppressed. So that's exactly what you want. You want all the power and you want all the victimization at the same time.

Speaker 4:          01:03:02       Well, yours. Yale is a great example because Yale was one of what happened with the Halloween costume debacle at gale was one of the first videos that was released that made people horrified where they, they couldn't believe how students were communicating with professors.

Speaker 2:          01:03:20       Yeah. Well, the student who, who screamed up a storm about, about that, uh, the male professor who was the husband of the woman who wrote the Pro Halloween costume letter, it turned out she was on the bloody hiring committee that hired him. One of the things she screamed was, who hired you? It was like, well, it turned out it was you because you were on the committee just a few years before. I know, and they took it like, yeah,

Speaker 4:          01:03:42       explain that to people that don't know what the hell we're talking about. Well, the explain this debacle because it really was about questionable Halloween costumes.

Speaker 2:          01:03:52       Well, it was about questioning Halloween costumes. Halloween costumes are a part of the whole point of Halloween is to have questionable costumes. Right. You play with depth for example, in decay and and horror and and it's, it's a time when the norms with regards to the expression of things that are outside of our normal behavior are suspended so that everybody can, can have a little celebration as it turns out. Well, you know, campuses have got all upset about things like cultural appropriation at Queen's University in Canada just the other week they were going after students who are dressing up as Vietcong for example, or Mexicans. It's like, I just don't see what the hell is racist about dressing up like a Mexican. Mexicans have a traditional traditional clothing. There's nothing wrong with Mexicans, so why is it wrong? Just dress up like that.

Speaker 4:          01:04:43       If you want to be Poncho via for Halloween, what's wrong with that?

Speaker 2:          01:04:46       Oh, well we'll give you can you can regard that as an image just as much as a denigration. It's like why is that such a problem? Right. But anyways, it doesn't matter because nothing's too trivial to be a problem to a social justice warrior and because they don't like to deal with real problems. And Yale went after Halloween

Speaker 4:          01:05:03       costs. So this woman wrote a letter saying maybe we should just relax about this stuff and you know, and not, don't put restrictions on what people wear for Halloween, but let people decide what is and isn't offensive.

Speaker 2:          01:05:16       Yes. Well in

Speaker 4:          01:05:18       many Halloween costumes are offensive. That's the point. But her letter was in a really reasonable. It was perfectly reasonable. It was like, it was like an adult wrote it. Yes. Yeah. And, and you know, all hell broke loose and she ended up. She ended up quitting and I think he did. No, I don't think. I don't think he left. I don't think he left, but she did. Seeing him bow down to this woman screaming at him in his face was so disturbing. It was so humiliating. I felt so humiliated for him because she was screaming, this is our home. What the fuck are you doing? You're not making it home. The university's not a home, right?

Speaker 2:          01:05:56       It's not a safe space. It's not a secure space. None of that. And, and if, if that, when they get a university isn't a home, that's not what it is. It's a place to be confronted by, I would say often horrible ideas. You want to learn about history, you think that's going to be safe. Do you know what human history is like? It's an endless blood bath with, with, with a certain amount of hopeful progress underlying it. It's, it's a, it's a, it's a horror show and great literature is like that. And, and, and biology is terrifying and physics is terrifying and you want to be safe. It's stay home. Stay home with your mom, stay home with your dad. Don't come to university if you want to be safe because even go outside. No, why don't we have you if you're going. If the university is going to make you safe, then it ceased to be a university, so one of the things I try to do in my class, I have this class called maps of meaning, which concentrates on atrocity basically on Soviet atrocity and and Nazi atrocities mostly, and what I try to do in the class is to teach my students that had they been in Nazi Germany in the 19 thirties, they would have been Nazis and had they been offered the opportunity to be an Auschwitz, Auschwitz camp guard than maybe they would have leapt at it and maybe they would have been in the sadistic, in the more sadistic proportion of the Auschwitz camp guard population.

Speaker 2:          01:07:19       You think that makes you feel safe. It doesn't make you feel safe to know that Nazis were humans and you happen to be one of them. So I think that educators that tell students that they're offering them a safe space are doing them a profound disservice. And you don't. I'm a clinical psychologist and here's one of the things you do to make people less afraid. You don't make the world safer. What you do is you people tell you what they're afraid of and then you break it into little bits so that they can go confront them. You know, so maybe they afraid of going to a party and you break that down. You say, well, do you know how to introduce yourself? And he said, well, I know I don't really even know how to shake someone's hand. And so then you practice having them shake their hand and introduce themselves because maybe they weren't taught by that by their halfway did parents, when they were, when they were young, because they were ignored and so then you say, well maybe you can go to a party for half an hour and all you have to do is introduce yourself to people and we'll call that success and you build up their competence

Speaker 3:          01:08:16       and their confidence one step at a time. And what happens to the clinical literature indicates quite clearly is you don't make people less anxious. By doing that, you make them braver. It's not the same thing. You don't make the world and its horrors smaller. You make the person and their their their capacity to deal with horror larger. You encourage them, you strengthened them. Now that's what you do at a university. You arm people with arguments, you hone their intellect, you, you help them learn to write so they can marshal their arguments. You, you'll help them learn how to engage in intellectual combat because that's better than engaging in real combat and you make them. You make them hard and strong. You don't mollycoddle them and make them safe unless you're their enemy, unless you're trying to devour their spirit. And that's what we have in the universities we have.

Speaker 3:          01:09:08       We have the reign of the diploe mother who's, who's answered everything is, Oh, just come a little closer and I'll protect you from the world. It's just like Hansel and Gretel, the, you know, the, the, the witch, and the Hansel and Gretel story. Well, my house is made of gingerbread. Just come in here and everything will be fine. While she feeds, you can need to fatten you up so she can eat you. That's the archetype of a modern university. When did this start? When did the trigger warnings, when did the safe spaces, when did all this emerge? Well, it has its roots in the student radicalism of the 19 sixties, especially the far left radical Islam. It really popped up in the 19 nineties and the early nineties when I was teaching in the US at that point and which university I taught at Harvard from 93 to 98 and there was a fair push for political correctness especially in the early part of the nineties but, but it, it got pushed back down and disappeared and went under ground and went underground is more accurate and then it's just come back with a vengeance in the last five years and I think it's partly because we have all these radical left political activists departments at the universities.

Speaker 3:          01:10:13       Women's studies being at the top of the list that have done nothing for the last 30 years to even longer than that. Now it's almost 40 years, 30 years, let's say, have done nothing but producing a never ending stream of ideological. He minded counter civilization, political activists and that's all subsidized by, by tuition and by the public purse. And that's another thing we really got to ask ourselves is why the hell are we subsidizing revolution? Why are we doing that? It's crazy and it's dangerous. It's dangerous.

Speaker 3:          01:10:52       What? So what exactly is going on with women's studies that you believe is fostering revolution? Well, you'd go on their websites and read, read what they say. I mean, first of all, for the, for the women's studies types, and this is a, what would you call it, a false anthropology. There's this idea that way back when there was a feminist paradise, uh, and that would be like noble savage mode of living where everything was egalitarianism and a women dominated. It was a matriarchal culture that was put forward by Ucla anthropologist named [inaudible]. I can never pronounce her name properly, but I think I got it. And then that was overthrown by patriarchal institutions essentially starting at about the time say, of the, of, of, of Judaism. And that was all overthrown. And ever since then we've lived in an oppressive patriarchy. And that's what our culture is.

Speaker 3:          01:11:46       It's an oppressive patriarchy. So they're pointing to one unsuccessful society that they believe existed or did it? No, no, it didn't exist. There's no evidence for whatsoever. It's, it's, it's complicated, but it's the, it's the telling of a kind of psychological myth as if it was history and, and, and anyway. So, so the basic claim is that Western civilization is a brutish patriarchy and that whatever positive things that might've managed to accomplish were all accomplished as a consequence of oppression and, and uh, and theft, and that the appropriate thing to do is to restructure it from the bottom up and they mean that they mean that they mean every single bloody concept. And you can marry that with modern postmodernism and throw in a nice stash of Marxism and you have the, the ideological and motivated grounds for social revolution. And I'm just go online and look at a dozen women studies websites.

Speaker 3:          01:12:42       Just read them. You can see what they say. They produce political activists and error. A goal is to restructure the patriarchy. Well, what's the patriarchy? While the patriarchy is Western civilization and what is restructure mean? That's easy. It means tear it down and destroy it. Why? Because it's a brutish system that's predicated on nothing but oppression. It's nothing but a tyranny in the. In the eyes of the, of the radical women's studies types. Heterosexuality. That's a tyranny. Capitalism. That's a tyranny. Democracy. Well, that doesn't even exist, and even if it did, it would be a tyranny. Everything's a tyranny, and so you can ask these and what would they replace it with? They replace it with their own ideological utopia. While we've already had 100 years of that and we saw what happened. Oh, well that doesn't matter. That wasn't real Marxism. That's what the bloody marks is.

Speaker 3:          01:13:31       Always say that wasn't real Marxism. It's like, oh, how many millions of people have to die before you're convinced that it's real Marxism and I know what they mean by that too. They mean, hey, if I was the Marxists dictator, things would've gone a lot better. It's like a. You should think again, sunshine. If you were the Marxists dictator, things wouldn't have gotten a lot better. So if you're the sort of person that thinks that if you would have been controlled, things would have gone a lot better than you're exactly the sort of person who should never be in control. So, and it's resentment. It's horrible. Resentment, you know? That's an important point because I think this is something that you've said that I absolutely agree

Speaker 1:          01:14:12       with that I think a lot of this thinking and the way people are behaving, it seems based on revenge. It seems based on revenge for awkward upbringings, social uncomfortable of uncomfortability, that it seems like there's something about the way they view the world where they want to get back at people that have literally done them no wrong.

Speaker 2:          01:14:32       It's resentment for the burden of being. It's deeper. It's deeper. I mean human being human existence is characterized by a fair bit of suffering. You know, we're limited creatures and life is very hard. Everyone dies. Everyone you love is going to die. Most of the things you do, all of the things you do will eventually fail. You know, suffering is a certainty and it's very easy for people to become resentful about, about being, about existence. You know, these kids who shoot up high schools and and and the, these mass shooters there, they're the perfect examples of, of people who run on nothing but resentment. They're out to kill the innocent because that's the best marker of a. that's the best way of showing just how much contempt they have for existence itself. Why punish the guilty? They deserve to be punished. It's a lot more malevolent and, and, and, and, and vengeful to punish the innocent. It's like people are motivated to a great degree by resentment of being and a huge chunk of that is manifested in, out to the dark side of the ideological possession. So I get to decide who my enemies are and then I get to go after them and I can go after them for every single thing that's ever been done to me that isn't good and we'll a lot of that's just built into the structure of existence.

Speaker 1:          01:15:43       Then they group up, they the exhibit confirmation bias. They all form some sort of a group. Think and then they act accordingly and this is what you've been warning against and this is where I completely agree with you in this why I think the subject is so important and I love the way you've outlined all the steps and the problems with Marxism and ideologies in general that we are dealing with this. These are the beginning steps of it and people who look at it now and they say it's social change and social justice. It's not.

Speaker 2:          01:16:12       It's not. It's not. That's right. It's not. This is not going to improve things. Implementing these policies will make things worse. They've made things worse. Every single place they've ever been implemented and often they've made things so much worse that you actually can't imagine it and people don't do the reading. I've done the reading, I've done the reading. I know how bad things can get. They can get so bad that no matter how bad you think they are, you're not even in the bloody ballpark.

Speaker 1:          01:16:38       Well, it's just so strange that these sort of courses and these sort of Ida ideologies are thriving in universities and it's really disconcerting to someone who has children. You know, that your children are going to go there and they trade schools. You know, I think, I think that, wow, that guy used to teach at Harvard, just send them to trade schools. The universities. I think. I think

Speaker 2:          01:17:02       the universities, I think you can make a reasonable case that the universities do more harm than good. Now I hate to say that. Well, this also,

Speaker 3:          01:17:10       this is a strange time where access to information is so incredibly easy. You can get, you could educate yourself, right? Seemingly endlessly online. Um, and with books and just, there's so much information available. It says not the 19 thirties does, it's not a time where it was difficult to get an education outside of the university the universities may have, or the university, which is like the repository of human wisdom and the attempt to expand that may have already moved outside the universities. You know, just because an institution calls itself the university doesn't mean it is. And many disciplines have turned into ideological factories and so where's the university mean? The university is wherever, where anyone wants to learn about their culture and where anyone wants to expand the domain of human competence. And a lot of that's happening online now, so maybe that's the future.

Speaker 3:          01:18:06       The only thing the universities have now, I think that that people can't get elsewhere is accreditation, but they're doing everything they can as fast as possible to make their accreditation valueless anyways. So yeah, it's really, it's. Yeah, it's a terrible thing to say that the universities may do more harm than good. And I haven't come to that conclusion lightly. Well, there's also say it. I'm sure you do. There's also a gigantic financial stake. The amount of money that it will not. And that's especially the case in the US. I mean, one of the things that's happened over the last 30 years is that the, the proportion of university expenditures that's gone to the administration has, has massively, massively increased. And at the same time the student loan burden has increased. And so what's happened and the weird senses that the administrators have conspired to steal the future earnings of their students and then you can't declare bankruptcy.

Speaker 3:          01:19:00       So to me it's indentured servitude, but you can't declare bankruptcy on student loan. You cannot declare bankruptcy on student loans. So you think about that. You tell me what difference there is between that and indentured servitude. There's not much because it's the only thing that I can even think of where that corporations can go bankrupt. They do it all the time. Ken individuals can. Businesses can fail you. You can be deemed incompetent or not capable of paying your debt in every other case, but not with universities. Right? That's crazy. It is crazy. It's crazy because they were just trying to combat the issue where so many kids were defaulting on their student loans. They try to make you perpetually responsible for it or you know. The idea is that these kids have to learn responsibility. Is that the way to do it? By overcharging them for some users will say that it's not a particularly useful to burden your citizenry with with a massive debt. As soon as they graduate at a time when they're most likely to take entrepreneurial risks, yes. You know you're not going to take entrepreneurial risks if you're so burdened with debt, you can't get yourself off the ground. Yeah, and we're talking about hundreds of thousands

Speaker 4:          01:20:08       of dollars in debt with people that are. If you're lucky, you're going to make what? Forty, $50,000 a year straight out of college. If you're lucky, so you're dealing with the amount of money that you would have to make if you didn't pay any taxes or didn't have any expenses. You'd have to work for four or five years longer than you would actually be in college to get that degree in the first place. It's insane. It's insane.

Speaker 2:          01:20:30       Alright. Would you say to, to the university students are listening, like a lot of your professors are Marxists. Ask them, ask them if they're Marxists. Read the Gulag archipelago first because you need to get your arguments together and nobody and won a Nobel prize for that book and for his other writing and it was one of the. One of the key. There was a couple of things that brought down the Soviet Union, but one of them was Alexander Solzhenitsyn's book and he demolished the intellectual credibility of of Marxism forever, but you have to read the damn book and you got to get your arguments in order to go after your Marxist professors ask them difficult book to read, a very difficult book to read. It's a very difficult book, although it's difficult because it's so horrifying. It's not difficult, particularly because it's impenetrable. It's in fact, it's an absolutely fascinating book in, in, in the same way that at that it's terrible. Horror story is fascinating, but. But there's no excuse for this. There's no excuse for these. These professors who, who claim who claimed to be benevolent Marxist.

Speaker 4:          01:21:30       So I think the way you framed it is very important. I think the way you framed it as them being compassionate intellectuals that are inclined toward this, because on the surface it seems like it's what a compassionate intellectual would would support.

Speaker 2:          01:21:44       Yeah. Yeah. And it's the unthinking adherence to compassion as the highest moral virtue.

Speaker 4:          01:21:49       And it's also whenever you have an ideology, whenever you have these rigid established forms of communication or methods of thinking, ew, ew, ew, box people in your box, people, then you control them and you get them to stick inside that ideology. And in doing so, you suppress people. It's so ironic that the people that are against suppressing are actually suppressing people through enforcing these ideologies and suppressing the marketplace of free ideas. You're not allowed to have free ideas. You're not allowed to debate these things. I mean, I've seen. There was that really famous instance at the University of Toronto where there's one guy, I don't even remember what it barrel. Yes. What was his more? Yeah, why men make.

Speaker 2:          01:22:32       Yeah. It was a multivariate analysis of the, of the income disparity between men and women. He used to be a feminist activist. He decided to go look into the claim that women were making. I think at the time it was seventy cents for every dollar that men were making. He thought, well, I have daughters. I better go check this out and see, you know, do a little bit of indepth investigating. And what he found out was that there were many reasons for the disparity and perhaps one of them was unfair discrimination, but there were another dozen and they seem to account more of the disparity

Speaker 1:          01:23:06       than the discrimination. I mean, just the fact that men take the more dangerous jobs is a, is a huge contributor to that. And it's not trivial. You should get paid more if you're putting your limbs on the line, you know, I mean, are you grew up in northern Alberta where were, were a lot of young men dropped out of school and went and worked on the oil rigs. It's like you go try that. Well maybe you could do it, but you know, the guys would lose their fingers. They'd lose their toes. They was 40 bloody below up there and they'd be wrestling pipe in the middle of the bush. I have a friend who does it. I have a friend who does that in northern Alberta. Horrific it is. It's tough work, man. And you're out in the Bush for two weeks and when you go outside, there's temperatures where you literally can't be outside of your truck for more than 30 minutes.

Speaker 1:          01:23:45       Right? You have to jump back in the truck. And that was called life where I grew up. Yeah, absolutely. Absolutely. Yeah. Those are very difficult jobs and they're very high pain because people die. Hard work. And there's not a lot of women taking those jobs. No. And, and, and a good thing too. So this guy, um, I'm sorry, what is his name again? Warren Farrell, Warren Farrell, who wrote this book was giving a speech about this book and it was, the response was so unbelievably violent and crazy and aggressive and also ignorant, ignorant to what he was saying, ignorant and not, not wanting to debate the facts but wanting to call him a massage, misogynist, wanting to call this a hate speech. And that's a favorite man. Already accused of that twice in the last two months because I don't want to use these compelled pronouns. Just like the one woman in the debate that you had with the other man that I believe is transsexual.

Speaker 1:          01:24:40       Yeah. The one woman who was trying to say what is the difference between not using those words and using racial slurs and hate speech to to describe these people like the idea, just the idea that that's a woman who is a professor who's expressing it in that way. What is the difference between not choosing to use made up pronouns versus calling someone a generally accepted racial slurs that they're trying to frame that as the same thing. The racial intellectually dishonest to the racial slurs are also legal. So what's happening is the law is already there is already such that not using one of these made up pronouns is a crime. Whereas using a racial epithet isn't.

Speaker 5:          01:25:26       Wow.

Speaker 1:          01:25:29       Wow. That's crazy. That's crazy. So you could use the n word. No, it's legally to. Yes, but you can't use you, can't you? You can have zero. He's have to say aZ who.

Speaker 5:          01:25:46       Wow,

Speaker 1:          01:25:47       this is crazy. This is really crazy. This is a bizarre moment in time. Whereas Bizarre postural nature of it is so undeniable that it's forcing a lot of people and I, I applaud you for doing what you're doing

Speaker 4:          01:26:04       and risking your, your, your status with the university, risking your support of your peers and sticking your neck out the way you've been doing with your youtube videos because if you hadn't done that, there's a lot of people who wouldn't be aware of how insidious and what you were describing earlier. The creep is slow creep towards pushing forward, waiting for you to object waiting and then moving forward a little bit more and once you relax. Yup. Because that's what this is. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          01:26:30       Yeah. And it's, it's been, it's been, it's been bizarre. I can tell you that. I mean my son and I counted the number of press articles that have been devoted to this. These are serious press articles. This doesn't count youtube or radio or TV or any of those things. I mean the youtube coverage has been, I would say overwhelming. There's been 170 major press articles written about those videos in the last two months.

Speaker 4:          01:26:50       And what's the general consensus are, I mean, are they going to begin with

Speaker 2:          01:26:56       to begin with? And the first two weeks, which was the most stressful part of this for me, I would say, um, I would say the bulk of the, of the press articles were, were, um, ran contrary to my views and their basic theme was something like, why doesn't the mean professor just play Nice? It was something like that. But, but luckily, fortunately I seem to maneuver past that. And then people started to actually read the, uh, the policies that I was speaking about and started to think about them. And one thing about the press is that they're actually fairly in favor of free expression given that that's their absolute bread and butter. And so the, the, the tenor shifted and I would say the overwhelming majority of press articles in the La sueur apart from the first two weeks have been, have been positive. Well, that's great. The

Speaker 4:          01:27:53       what you've done in your youtube videos, which I think is an amazing forum, particularly for what you're doing, is document and describe in great detail the issues with every single one of these problems with no interruption and I think that's one of the best things about it. The fact that there's not really a whole lot of forums that will give you the chance to express yourself. I've seen some of your videos have hundreds of thousands of views and there's not a whole lot of forums where you can do that and speak for A. I mean they're all like an hour long. Right? I know, I know. I mean it's. It's amazing.

Speaker 2:          01:28:25       It's amazing. Youtube is. Youtube is. Well, I started, I posted, started posting my lectures on Youtube, my classroom lectures in 2013 and in really bare bones form. They're just an ipad recording of me lecturing. I didn't edit in the slides of the images partly because that's very time consuming, but then I watched it for about two years and by September of this year it declined to about a million views. And then I really started thinking about youtube because youtube was cute cat videos, you know, Justin bieber songs for a very long period of time, but it's not that anymore and that's probably been about two years or maybe two and a half years. But then I realized that Youtube is actually a revolution that's as, as overwhelming as the Gutenberg press revolution. Gutenberg invented the printing press and because for the first time in human history, a lecture can have the same reach and the same longevity as a book and it's a lot easier for people to listen and that the time lag publication is basically zero, right?

Speaker 2:          01:29:25       I mean because you can do it live I guess as we are right now or you can post it in a day or two after publishing it and, and you have access to this insanely large audience. And the other thing that's really interesting about youtube with regards to my, especially the more academic videos, is there's only one reason that people are watching them. One, it's not the production quality. The audio is okay and I'm a good speaker, but it's not the production quality. The reason they're watching them is because they want to know and that's something that's really cool about youtube and youtube also seems to be quite skeptical about advanced production values. You know, the people who are, who are popular are often people like you who are basically sitting there talking and everyone's listening. It's like, oh, well people are actually talking about something and this turns out to be interesting. It's like the rebirth of genuine journalism. So yeah, youtube is a, God only knows what youtube is, but.

Speaker 4:          01:30:19       Well, I think it's international revolution. I believe you're right. And I think the Internet in general is this really new thing in terms of the ability to express yourself. I mean it's only existed for 20 plus years and in terms of human history, that's a blink of an eye and it's only really been used as you, you've described over the last couple of years in this form. And I think, uh, it also is responsible, I think for a great deal of the rise of the popularity of the social justice movement. I think it's a double edge sword. I think these echo chambers and these people that do find these patterns of behavior that they subscribe to, and I think that is part of the problem with ideologies in general is that instead of thinking for yourself, you subscribe to a predetermined pattern or behavior and you will lock in like, this is what I'm supposed to believe.

Speaker 4:          01:31:09       This is what I'm supposed to enforce. This is what I'm supposed to side with, and you go with that. One of the good things about the internet is that it is potentially possible to see contrary viewpoints and analyze them in the comfort of your own home and being by yourself and and looking at maybe one of your videos and maybe someone come to you and I'm sure a lot have come to your videos in anger, mad at you, and then listen to your points of view and listen to how clearly you've established all of these positions and what what you actually feel is the problem with these positions. In a very, very calm and very rational and a very well educated point of view. I think the these people, they have the potential to be at least informed it because you're the.

Speaker 2:          01:31:56       I've had lots of, I've had lots of letters maybe, I don't know, 2,500 letters maybe to my, to my email accounts now about this and a very large number of them, maybe maybe 200 letters, 150 to 200 have been from people on the radical left who've written to me and said that they can no longer speak because the authoritarian types, the PC authoritarians have got. So controlling that there once fashionable position is now been deemed unacceptable and they, they're alienated and it excluded. I mean, you see that happening with feminists like Jermaine greer. I mean Jermaine greer who's been banned from campuses, um, she's not very happy with the idea that being a woman is something that's been reduced to a whim, right? Because she thinks that there's more to being a woman than mirror subjective choice. While that's no longer a tenable viewpoint on the left. And so people who hold that view point, many of them are feminists, are no longer getting along with the say radical gender bender, activist types who've who've got center stage at the moment. So

Speaker 4:          01:32:59       yeah, Christine Summers has the same issue with that. She's a feminist and she calls herself the factual feminist and she pushes back against and what her perspective is is instead of embracing these false narratives and running with them as if they're the facts and and and just using that to reinforce your ideology. She saying that does feminism a disservice? Let's look at the actual reality of the situation and let's look at it from a balanced and objective perspective and she gets so much hate for them. The idea of being rational and objective.

Speaker 2:          01:33:32       Well that that's because as far as the postmodern social justice warriors are concerned, those are just code words for oppression. There's no object. You've got to remember this with regards to having these sorts of arguments. When you say objective and rational, that's predicated on your implicit belief that there is such a thing as the objective and there is such a thing as rational. And the radical postmodernists, they do not buy that. Not at all, not at all. As far as they're concerned. That's just another power game on your part. And Bill built into the laws like bill [inaudible] in Canada now in the same, in the laws in New York City that governed the use of these gender pronouns built into the law is the idea that there's no biological a foundation for your identity and that it's all purely subjective. They built that into the law, no objective reality, no biology that's going to unfold over the next 20 years

Speaker 4:          01:34:28       or not. I mean, isn't it, isn't it possible that these kinds of discussions and that your videos and then all the people that agree and all the people that are pushing back against this can have some sort of an effect on this movement

Speaker 2:          01:34:40       I think? Or do you think to say yes? I mean, are you cynical about the future? No, no, no. I'm not at all cynical about the future. I am cynical about my ability to predict the future. Like when I was younger, much younger back in the 19 eighties. I mean, I was very, very concerned about the possibility of nuclear war, but by a, by yes, as we all were. Yes. By bought about, by about the mid nineties though, I realized that things were in such a state of chaotic flux that the one thing I can be certain of was that no matter what I was afraid of with regards to the future, that isn't what was going to happen and so I'm not cynical about the future, but I do believe that we're in an unprecedented state of indeterminate indeterminacy and flux and God only knows what could happen.

Speaker 2:          01:35:29       I'm not having said that. I wouldn't say I'm optimistic about the possibility that the universities will reform themselves because I think that. Well, even with the free speech debate that that the University of Toronto hosted, they did three politically correct things during the debate, which, which I thought was really interesting because if I would have staged a debate and been working on their side, let's say, I would have said strategically speaking, no politically correct maneuvering during this debate because all it's gonna do is discredit us, but that isn't what happened. The university opened up by noting that the land on which we were having the debate was once the. What was one's property owned by the original native set native Americans, which is something I find it boring because on the one hand we took it and now on the other hand we want to be friends. It's like that's.

Speaker 2:          01:36:21       I don't think you get to have both sides of that moral play at the same time, but that's okay. That's how the university opened the debate and then the next thing that happened was that they announced that there would be counselors waiting outside for anybody who was too traumatized by the contents of the discussion and then they closed. They closed by announcing the Trans Day of remembrance, you know, and but, and the reason I'm pointing this out is because it, it just shows you the fact that those things happened. They weren't even strategic. That's just how things are at the university and they didn't even notice that people were going to turn themselves inside out. Noticing that saying, well God, this is so biased. I can hardly believe it, which is exactly what happened. That's how saturated the universities are with this kind of thinking and I don't have any idea what can reverse that collective decisions on the part of citizens a to stop sending their children there be to stop donating money and leaving it in wills and see to pressure politicians like in my wilder moments, I think cut the funding to the universities by 25 percent and let the faculty have a war about what's important and maybe what would be leftover with what the university should be.

Speaker 2:          01:37:31       But I really think it's, with the exception of the science, technology, engineering and mathematics ends of things. I think it's come to that. Don't you think that what you're doing when you're making these videos is in a sense branching out a way from just a university and teaching online because you all, like I said, I think that that you could make a case that that's where the university is because that's where people are going just to get knowledge. They have no other, they have no other motivation

Speaker 1:          01:38:02       and this is a new thing obviously, but at one point in time, so it was the printing press, right? And this, this, this new ability to disseminate information seems to me to be more effective, more accessible, more reasonable. Yeah, and it's entirely possible that what we're looking at is the future of

Speaker 2:          01:38:20       kg. It could be, it could be. I mean I've just been spending a lot of time in the last month or so also concentrating on video editing and so I spent about 10 hours this week video editing about an hour, a discussion with a Russian Orthodox icon carver. Weirdly enough that I'm going to launch in the next three or four days and it, it, we, we discussed things that, that are very image heavy and so I've been cutting in a lot of images and it is a technology that far supersedes what I mean. I like lecturing and lecturing. Lectures can be very effective, but basically with youtube you can turn your lecture into a documentary and then instead of teaching 100 people you can teach 50,000. It's like that's a lot different. That's a lot different and it's up there permanently.

Speaker 1:          01:39:08       Yes. And that 50,000 can grow and grow and grow and as it becomes more spread and shared, the also the discussions about it become more varied.

Speaker 2:          01:39:17       Yup. Well three more than 3 million people have watched some element of this in the last couple of months and in September I had about 9,000 subscribers. That took me about two years, three years to build. And one of my ambitions, which was kind of a tongue and cheek and comical ambition is I thought, hey, you know, I bet I can get more subscribers in the next three years. Then the UFT has students. I thought, well that's pretty interesting, is like all of a sudden I could have a body of students, let's say that's larger than the entire university's like what? We'll just exactly what the hell does that mean? And the answer to that is, I don't know what that means. Who knows what that means, but one of the other perverse things that happened while I was being warned and a cautioned by the university was that my subscriber base grew from 9,000 to $65,000.

Speaker 2:          01:40:08       So now I have more youtube subscribers than the University of Toronto has students. It's like, so then I think, well hell, you know, I could do a whole series on Solzhenitsyn. I could do a whole series on George Orwell. I could do a whole series on the Aldous Huxley. I could do a whole series on archetipal biblical stories and half of me thinks, well, if 50,000 people are going to watch each of those and I can turn them into documentaries instead of just lectures. Maybe that's what I should be doing. Like I couldn't write a book with that much reach. That's crazy. Reach crazy. Yeah, it's, it's, it's, it's revolutionary. I believe that. I believe it's revolutionary.

Speaker 1:          01:40:46       I believe it is too. And I believe no one saw it coming and I think it's such a new thing that we're all just sort of starting to get a handle on how to it and what it's

Speaker 2:          01:40:54       capable of. Yes. Well it was like the Internet was for pornography. Well that changed quick and youtube was for cute cat videos and that changed quick too. You don't know what the technology is going to do.

Speaker 4:          01:41:05       Well it's also a, I don't know how much you've paid attention to virtual reality or how much you've experimented with it, but my good friend Duncan trussell has one of those htc vives and uh, I put it on over his house. He runs a podcast and we, we played with it for about an hour and a half and then we did a podcast and I am thoroughly convinced, especially now with a new phones, there's a phone that I just got called the Google Pixel and it comes. You can buy it with this headset, you slide the phone into the headset, you put on this virtual reality a program and you're watching a virtual reality show on your phone, a regular phone that fits in your pocket, just slides to the headset. You could do not just a two dimensional thing where you're showing a lecture and showing images and having a discussion and putting these images in the background. We're in the foreground and have the audio over it, but rather you could have three dimensional things where you could show a city of village a mountain range. You could show a geometric patterns you could get involved in. I mean it could be used for a million different things and not just for entertainment but also for education and I think that is, that's the next step I think.

Speaker 2:          01:42:21       I mean it's a. it's an unbelievably fascinating new. Well, you must be. Must be shocked to some degree at how popular your podcasts have become. I mean, you have, I don't know how many people on Youtube have larger subscriber base than you, but it's not that many. So I mean, how. How do you account for that and does that surprise you? It's surprising, but it's that this whole, this whole podcast thing is very surprising, but it's um, the youtube is only a small fraction of the amount of people that actually listen to the podcast. The numbers of the downloads are insane. Jamie, what was the last month's numbers? Was the youtube was around 12 million for the month and audio is at $60. Million. Wow. Yeah. I haven't done, like, I haven't played vr anywhere near enough with turning my online lectures into podcasts. He's definitely should. You definitely should. It's, I mean, a lot of it you could listen to when you're in a car or when you're exercising or that sort of thing. Yeah. No, I know. Glued to a screen with the podcasts.

Speaker 4:          01:43:18       No, I was doing some work around my office when I was listening to one of yours, one of one of your things on youtube and I found that it was just as interesting if I was doing some other things around my office. It's a very good passive, like podcasts themselves are very good passive form of income.

Speaker 2:          01:43:33       Yes, absolutely entertainment that makes them different than reading because reading is faster if you're a good reader, but you can't do anything else while you're doing it. Right. People are much more naturally attuned to listening than they are to read it because we've only been reading really human beings have only been reading roughly speaking in any large numbers for hundred years. Right. It's a blink of the eye. Whereas we'd been listening for a very, very long period of time and all this new technology like puts us right back. It puts us back into tribal mode basically, except with this incredible technological enhancement. It wouldn't be difficult at all to extract the audio from any of these youtube videos and just start putting it online as a podcast and again, you know, people could listen to it when they're in traffic, when they can't look at it.

Speaker 2:          01:44:17       Anything on planes, I'm on the bus or wherever you are, where you can just sit down and you. You can close your eyes and you don't have to be paying attention to it visually. Yeah. Well, I, about four or five months ago, I emailed the university, the University of Toronto because they have a kind of a massive online course branch, which they're toying with and I said, look, I've got a million people who've watched my videos, like maybe you guys should give me a hand. We should do something about this because I got a million people who are watching these videos. It's like that's, that's a significant number of people. It's worth attending to, but perhaps I contacted the wrong people but I never did get a response, but it's something I'm. While I'm doing it actively right now and I think the quality of my videos has improved substantially in the last month and I really liked doing the video editing.

Speaker 2:          01:45:05       Although it's very painstaking, but it's definitely the universities better be careful because they're dumping their content online as fast as they can. They're going to make themselves completely superfluous and some smart person. I've been thinking about this for 20 years is going to take over the accreditation end because you know all you'd have to do is set up a series of well designed examinations online and only let a minority of people pass. You have instant accreditation credibility. It's like here's an entire three years worth of psychology courses. Here's the exams. You take them. Only 15 percent of the people pass. Why only 15 percent. Why would you limit the number because it makes the accreditation valuable, but you would limit the number based on what if you had a much larger group than 15 percent that were effectively absorbing the information that you did? Well, fair enough.

Speaker 2:          01:46:00       You'd have to. You'd have to toy with a. you'd have to toy with the accreditation mechanisms, but I mean part of part of the utility and the accreditation is that it's inequality. If everyone gets accredited then the accreditation is worth noting. They just make it difficult because that's what you do is make a difficult. Yeah, but I mean instead of limiting difficulty. Okay, so you wouldn't necessarily be limiting the number. You would just make it so difficult that the number would be limited, almost match. That's right. Well, I think I'd probably make it. I'd probably live. Yes, that's exactly right. I wouldn't limit the number of times people could take the exams. That's a great idea as well. So as long as you hit threshold, I mean that's what happens often. Say with, with uh, like if you're trying to trying to pass the bar or something like that, you get to take it a number of times, but you have to, you have to hit threshold. Well, Thaddeus Russell,

Speaker 1:          01:46:50       who, who's a history professor at Occidental, he, um, he's doing that very same thing. He talked about it here that he's building right now, an online university and he is planning on giving out degrees in history through his online university because he's been teaching at universities for a long time and he has a huge problem also with the politically correct movement. And he was speaking out against a, this really crazy story where these two kids, uh, adults got intoxicated and had sex. And because they were both intoxicated for some reason, the boy was described as the attacker and was a, he was being accused of sexual assault and even though it was consensual, completely consensual, even though they were both, not only did she send him, she sent him texts saying, do you have condoms? Come on over, we're going to do this. But he, because they were intoxicated, he was the one that was the rapist, which is insane.

Speaker 1:          01:47:51       It's sexist. It's 100 percent sexist though, that that kid is suing, you know, and that ace Russell came on here and discussed it, but that politically correct ideology where it's, it's essentially it's prejudice against men in that particular theory. The idea that he's stepping outside of the university. I slowly moved. It means God gets sod is doing that exactly it to yes. And you know, he gets 100,000 people watching is v each video. Yeah. He's been out here a few times. I love that guy. And again, he's another one who like yourself, has stuck his neck out and spoke out about what he thinks is this preposterous movement towards denying facts, denying reality and forming these narratives that are based on their ideologies and, and sticking within this box and then seeking to find people that agree with it and then reinforcing these ideas in this echo chamber.

Speaker 1:          01:48:43       And it's just, it's for someone who's outside of it like myself. It's a fascinating thing to watch for someone who's inside of it like yourself, it must be maddening. Well, we've tried to. We've tried other online interventions too, so I have these youtube videos up, but we also designed. I work with some corporations a while back because I've done some consulting and I had designed tests to help people hire better employees, which I still do. And in fact I worked with his company up in, in California called the founder institute and it's the world's largest stage early technology company incubator. It's created 2,500 companies in the last four years and we test now in 135 cities. But when I was marketing these tests to companies, they kept asking me what could be done about their poorer performing employees, and I said, well, I didn't know because it's not that easy to. If you have someone who's problematic, who's troubled, it's not that easy for a manager to figure out how to straighten them out and they just don't have the time. They don't have the time, they don't have the manpower, they don't have the training usually to do that. But I designed this set of programs

Speaker 3:          01:49:48       called the self authoring suite, and one of them, the future authoring program helps people write out a plan for their life. So it helps them to ask you some questions about six dimensions of your life. You know, your, your health, mental and physical, your use of drugs and alcohol, your wishes three to five years down the road for intimate relationships, for family, for career, for education and so on. It asks you, what could your life be like three to five years down the road? If you set it up for you, like you were someone you were taking care of. So it asks you those six questions, then it asks you to write for 15 minutes about about your vision for your life. You get to have what you want and what would be good for you, what would that be? And then it asks you to write for 15 minutes about what your life would be like three to five years down the road.

Speaker 3:          01:50:35       If you let your bad habits and you're, you know, idiocies in your foolishness is in your weaknesses. Take the upper hand in, Auger you into the ground because everyone knows about that. And so it's like you get to design a little heaven to strive for and little hell to avoid and then you write for. Then you basically turn that into an implementable plan. That's the second part of the program. We've used that with about 5,005 to 7,000 university students now mostly in Europe at the Rotterdam School of management. And we've raised their grade point average of their kids. Twenty five percent drop their dropout rate the same and it's had a walloping effect on men and on non Western ethnic minorities, it's moved the Non Western ethnic minority student population performance at Rotterdam, School of Management from 70 percent below the, the average to above the female Dutch, uh, natives. And so the other, the reason I'm telling you this in part from the fact that it's a very good program, and um, we did it at Mohawk college in Canada a year ago and we dropped their dropout rate in the first semester, 50 percent and that especially again worked well for men because men are at more risk of dropping out now and, and, and especially for men who didn't have good grades in high school.

Speaker 3:          01:51:47       So not only is there the possibility for the net to provide tremendous dissemination of intellectual material, but there's also the possibility for the net to provide dissemination of psychological interventions that have major impacts on people's mental health and productivity at almost at extraordinarily low cost. So that's really been fun too. So I think providing some that sort of a structure and a framework, giving people the tools just inform of asking them questions. What would you like to do is describe this, what is your view and when you do that, you sort of allow them to help themselves outline what they would like to accomplish, which most people don't do well in our education system, our education system was designed in Chicago in the late 18 hundreds to produce factory workers because it was set up when when rural people were migrating to the cities on mass because their kids, first of all, we're likely to get factory jobs and second of all, if you were working in factory, your kids needed to be taken care of and so the purpose of the schools was to train factory workers, which is why everyone's lined up enrolls rose and why there are bells.

Speaker 3:          01:52:56       It's a factory model. The problem with that is that now people's careers basically have to be self determined, but that's never. That's never part of the education system. Part of the reason I developed these programs was because I realized this is the same course where I'm teaching students that if they would have been in Germany in the 19 thirties, they would have be Nazis. I'm trying to get them to design their lives and it's way better to have someone articulate their own plan. You actually neurologically rewire people by having them formulate their own thoughts, which is why you know your school teachers used to say, put it in your own words. It's actually very good advice. If they would explain what that means. It's like if you have to conjure up the thoughts and you have to articulate them, then they change you and so well, and so this program has had the, the, the, the effects have been absolutely overwhelming for us as researchers because it's very, very difficult to produce an intervention that actually has a positive effect on people you know, you hope it does, but generally when you test it out, it's like, no, it doesn't do what you thought it did.

Speaker 3:          01:54:02       Or sometimes it even has the reverse effect. That sounds fascinating. Now, how do people have had, can someone, a regular person have access to this? It's called self authoring. So that's e l, f authoring, like, like writing a book, self authoring Dotcom and the programs I gave away the future authoring program. I think it might still be free. Um, it was, yeah, it is until the end of November I did a video called message to millennials were because one of the things Jonathan Heit said about, uh, he called Karl Marx, the patron saint of the social justice warriors and John Stuart Mill, that patron saint of people say who stood for objective truth and freedom of expression. And I thought that was really smart. He said Brown university is number one for social justice warrior universities in Chicago for Truth Universities. But one of the things that marks has over John Stuart mill is that mark's is a social revolutionary and young people like to think about ways to change the world.

Speaker 3:          01:54:59       Right? And that's actually a positive part of their development. It's a stage that the developmental psychologist, Sean Piaget called the messianic stage and he associated that with late adolescents. So like while young people want to change the world, the problem is, is that that's been harnessed into attempts to change other people, but that isn't what you should do if you want to change the world, you should change yourself. And I don't mean that in some cliched sense. I mean it in the sense that Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn said when he analyzed the Soviet Union, he said, don't be thinking that the line that divides good from evil runs down political spectrum or, or, or countries or something like that. It runs down right down the middle of your soul. And if you want to sort out the world and what you do is you sort yourself out. It's a serious business, right?

Speaker 3:          01:55:44       They say it's more difficult to rule yourself than to rule a city. And that's the truth because you're a complicated and there are horrible monsters inside of you that need to be tamed and to, and to be brought and to be brought into alignment and submission so that you can be a powerful and useful person. And um, I gave away the future authoring program as part of this video I made suggesting to millennials that instead of rushing out there to change the world by changing other bad people that they should look inward and sort themselves out properly. And I think we've given away about four or 5,000 of those programs so far now free till the end of November. And then what happens with it? It's, well the self or the future authoring program is regularly $14, ninety five cents. And the whole self authoring suite which involves, it's a program that helps you write an autobiography.

Speaker 3:          01:56:33       So it helps you sort out things about your past that are still burdening you. You can tell a if, if you have a memory that's more than 18 months old approximately, and when you pull that memory up to mind, if you still have an emotional reaction, that means you haven't fully articulated the memory, you haven't analyzed it causally, you haven't, you haven't freed yourself from its grasp and you're carrying it like a weight and your brain responds to that. Like the more have more weight you're carrying like that more baggage. Let's say the more of the stress Hormone Cortisol your brain produces and cortisol makes you old. Some of this work has been done by James Pennebaker at the University of Texas at Austin because he. He started to pioneer these sorts of writing programs and he found that if people wrote about uncertain things past, present or future so they could be traumatic things, they could be uncertain, things that their physical health improved and he.

Speaker 3:          01:57:28       He did a lot of detailed research trying to figure out why that was and basically came down to the explanation that it was something like an uncertainty reduction mechanism at work because your brain is always figuring out how well situated are you in the world. How much do you not know compared to how much have you mastered? And you can tell that you've mastered things because when you go somewhere and you act things turn out the way you want them. That's an indication of mastery and your brain is sort of keeping track across your whole life of how many places you've been, where things haven't worked out compared to how many places you have been, where they have worked out, and if all those places in your past where things haven't worked out, you need to map and master and that that decreases the existential load on you, but that actually decreases your psychophysiological load.

Speaker 3:          01:58:17       It makes you healthier. It makes you less stress, and so we've put all that together in this self authoring suite to help people write about their past, to sort it out in a. In a detailed autobiography. It asks you questions about your past. It says, divide your life up into six epochs and then divide each of those. That might be, say, oh, birth to kindergarten and then maybe elementary school and then maybe junior high school, however you want to do it, and then to write about the emotionally significant events in each of those epochs and then to describe their effects on you and then to analyze how you did in those situations. What you might have done differently. What you might do differently in the future to straighten out your past, and I've done that with my students in my maps of meaning class for about the last 10 years and some people have written 15,000 words.

Speaker 3:          01:59:03       It's not that uncommon for students to write 15,000 words and their autobiography. Wow. So that's such great advice. That's such great advice about reconciling with your past because so many people just carry it around. Yeah. Well, if you're. If you're thinking about your past, what it means is you haven't analyzed the causal chains because you might say, well, why do you remember your past? While you might say, well, it's in order to have an objective, you know, record of the past. It's like it has nothing to do with that. There's only one reason you remember the past and that's to be prepared for the future. That's why you remember the past. And so what you're supposed to do is take the past and extract out from it. Wisdom and wisdom is the ability to avoid stumbling blindly into ditches. And so you think, well, here's a time in my past.

Speaker 3:          01:59:50       I stumbled blindly into this horrible ditch and terrible things happened to me. It's like, okay, you need to take that apart. You need to figure out how was it that that events conspired with your participation voluntarily or involuntarily so that that terrible consequences merged. You need to know why that happened and how you could react differently in that situation, and as soon as you do that, your brain will leave it alone. You won't obsess you about it anymore because the anxiety producing parts of your brain are basically trying to tell you where there are obstacles in your environment. It's like, look out. Don't go there. Don't go there. It's like, well, don't go there. There's fire. Well, maybe you could master the fire, right? Then you're a wielder of fire. You're not just a victim and lots of situations are dangerous or not dangerous depending on your level of mastery, right?

Speaker 3:          02:00:42       Life is like that, and so a negative emotion that's associated with a memory is something that's crying out for mastery and writing can really help with that. So you're reorganizing your brain. When you write autobiographically, you're, you're basically the emotions. Imagine emotion memories can be stored at different levels of your brain, some sort of primordial reptilian image laden areas that are very emotional up to finally articulated plans for your future life. Will you want to take everything that's negative and emotional and transform that into a fully articulated vision for your future and that frees you of your past. You shouldn't be thinking about your past. I mean maybe if you're 80 and you know you're going over a well spent life, that's a whole different thing, but if you're a 30, 35 or 20 and most of the time you thinking about your past, it's like it's like your soul is trapped back there and you need to.

Speaker 3:          02:01:40       You need to free it through investigation and the metaphysical language is appropriate because that is in a sense what you're doing. You're trapped in the past. It's like you've got to break free of that so you can use all your resources to move ahead into the future. Anyways in these programs, the future authoring program, like I said, has had walloping effects on people. It's dones. Fantastic advice to me. It's just so. It's so logical and it sounds so great. I mean, I think that's one of the gigantic problems that a lot of people have with education, that you're learning facts, you're learning information, but you're not learning how to use your own mind. Now here's something that's really interesting about that. So I spent a lot of time. I'm a scientist, but I'm also. I would say I'm also a religious person. I'm a deeply religious person and how do you reconcile those? Exactly. Well, that's that. And I spent literally, I've spent 40 years thinking about that and for 20 of those years I did almost nothing but think about that all the time and I realized something partly from Reading Carl young and what I realized was that

Speaker 3:          02:02:43       even the fundamentalists have have the wrong idea about religious truth. Religious truth is not scientific truth in the stories in genesis, which are very old stories, maybe tens of thousands of years old. They're obviously not scientific theories because the people who wrote the board scientists, we didn't have science until about 500 years ago. So the idea that the stories in genesis or scientific theories is just false on every possible front. So then you might say, well, there's no other truth, but scientific truth. It's like, well, wait a minute. That's not true because what scientific truth tells you is what things are, but genuine religious truth tells you how you should act and those things are not the same. And so a great story, a great novel which is a quasi religious construction because it's, it's like a distillation of ordinary life into its most important elements.

Speaker 3:          02:03:40       That's a map about how you should comport yourself in the world. And you might say, well what do you mean by should? And because that's, that's the question, the moral relativist Sask. And there's an answer to that too. As far as I can tell, and I got this partly from reading John Piaget. So imagine that here's how you should act. You should act so that things are good for you, like they would be for someone you're taking care of, but they have to be good for you in a way that's also good for your family. And they have to be good for you and your family in a way that's also good for society and maybe even also good for the broader environment. If you could manage that so it's balanced at all those levels and then they that has to be good for you and your family and society and the world right now and next week and next month and a year from now and 10 years from now and so it's this harmonious balancing of multiple layers of being simultaneously and and that's a.

Speaker 3:          02:04:36       that's a. that's a Darwinian reality. I would say. Your brain is actually attuned to tell you when you're doing that and the way it tells you is that it chew, it reveals that what you're doing is meaningful. That's the sign that you and your nervous system is adapted to do this. It's adapted to exist, I would say on the on the edge between order and chaos and chaos is where things are so complex. You can handle it in order is where things are so rigid that it's too restrictive. In between that there's a place, a place that's meaningful where you're partly stabilized and partly curious and you're operating in a manner that increases your scope of of knowledge, so you're. You're inquiring and growing and at the same time you're stabilizing and renewing you, your family, society, nature. Now, next week, next month and next year, and when you have an intimation of meaning, then you know you're there and I can give you an existential demonstration of that.

Speaker 3:          02:05:36       So imagine that each of these levels of existence, the way I just laid them out or like patterns or patterns within patterns, within patterns, within patterns, and there's a way of making all that harmonious. That's what music models. That's why music is so meaningful. You know, you take a beautiful orchestral composition and all the instruments are doing different things at different levels, but they all flow together harmoniously and you're right in the middle of that as a listener and it fills you with a sense of. It's almost like a sense of religious or even if you're a punk rock nihilist, you know, and the reason for that is because the music is modeling the manner of being that's harmonious, it's the proper way to exist and religious writings in the deepest sense, so those are archetipal writings are are our guidelines to that mode of being so they're not true like scientific truth is true there.

Speaker 3:          02:06:29       I think of them as hyper there hypertrophy or meditate true. It's like we take the most true things about your life and then we take the most true things about 10 other people's lives and we amalgamate them into a single figure and that would be like to. That would be like a literary hero. Then we take a thousand literary heroes and we extract out from each of them what makes the most heroic person. That's a religious daddy. That's what Christ is. He's a metta hero and that sits at the bottom of western civilization and his architectural mode of being his true speech. That's the fundamental idea of western civilization and it's right

Speaker 4:          02:07:16       now when you say, when you talk about this harmonious frequency that's achieved, what? How do you reconcile all the stories that were like say in the Old Testament that were extremely violent or with they're ridiculous. Like, Oh, who was the guy that they made fun of, these children made fun of? I'm so God sent a bear to kill the children because they made fun of him for being bald. Or there's a bunch of stories and ridiculous tails in the Bible that obviously have the hand of man on them. How do you separate those from the beautiful concepts that are outlined in religion? Like you treat everyone as if they are your brother, you know, love and let love

Speaker 2:          02:08:03       and that was very, very difficult because it's all in the Old Testament. Let's say the Old Testament was obviously written by people who were deeply tribal. Of course, we're also deeply tribal and some of the problems that those people were trying to face trying to sort out was, well, how do you organize yourself within your own tribe? Justly and mercifully and at the same time, defend yourself against the barbarians who constitute other drives. Well, that was. That was the problem that humanity was trying to solve when it was a mega meeting. All of its tribes process that obviously still hasn't, hasn't finished, and some of the ways that you protect your own tribe rapidly become horrifying and so many of the stories in the Old Testament that have to do essentially with tribal protection are immediately horrifying, but there's also a. there's a developmental pathway through the combination of the old and New Testament that that, that show, I would say how that morality that was fundamentally tribal to begin with transformed itself over thousands of years into a morality that was what that transcended tribal distinctions and so part of the imposition of the new testament onto the old testament was the imposition of a morality that transcended tribal morality onto a morality that was fundamentally tribal in origin.

Speaker 2:          02:09:24       But the new testament of course was

Speaker 4:          02:09:26       constructed by Constantine and the series of bishops. They took things out.

Speaker 2:          02:09:32       I mean how so? Well, it's not much different. Here's a way of thinking about it, so I have a friend who's a comic book writer and I've talked to him a fair bit about archetypes in comics. For example. He was a student of mine at Harvard long time ago and the Comic Book Universe is a very interesting one because obviously these fictional characters were thought up by single people and then the fictional characters were transformed into stories and then the stories were sent out into a broader community. But then what started to happen was the broader community started to stay in contact with the people who are writing the stories and so if you do something like write Batman now, there's a bunch of things you can't do with Batman because there's been a collective decision made in the entire community of multiple writers and the entire community of multiple readers that have decided that there's a core story that has a certain structure in certain elements. And so there's this collective process of imagination that's gone into constructing what you might describe as a heroic Meta narrative. And

Speaker 3:          02:10:34       the reason I'm using that as an example is because there isn't a lot of difference, perversely enough in the construction, say of Comic Book Heroes and the construction of religious deities, and I'm not saying that religious daddies or nothing but comic book characters or maybe I'm elevating comic book characters beyond the status that they normally attained. But if you think, think about this, for example, with regards to something like the construction of the recent marvel universe, I mean those avenger movies are among the most expensive technological artifacts that human beings have ever made and they drive our computational capacity to its absolute limit. And the reason for that is because we're using that fictional space to lay out an archetypical and mythological view of the universe. It's a practice domain for modes of being. And I mean in the Marvel Universe, obviously Tony Stark Ironman is, is technological man, right? He's trying to develop a real relationship with his partner pepper potts whose own sort of independent woman and he's attempting to use technology to build himself up into something that has the status of approximately a god to transcend more limitation.

Speaker 3:          02:11:43       And all of that, um, so there's a, there's a daddy like aspect, the growth of a deity emerging there, and then of course thor and Loki, or they're not comic book ease at all. Their actual daddy's there, the hostile brothers. It's an archetypal, it's an archetype will pair like Christ and Satan or Batman and the joker or superman and Lex luthor. And that's the good part of the individual against the evil part of the individual, roughly speaking, that's played out in these myths. And so that collective process that you described whereby an entire group of people comes together to decide what the central religious text is. I mean, on the one hand you can think of that as the gerrymandering of a religious process. Maybe that's something that's only devoted towards the acquisition of power. Like that would be a Marxist analysis. But on the other hand, you can think of it as the collective imagination.

Speaker 3:          02:12:34       Attempting to build a dramatic, uh, to build, to build a and exemplary drama that everyone can act out. And it's, it's enacting that exemplary drama that we're actually able to interact in a civilized and productive manner. Like look at this discussion that we're having to, to the degree that it's working, we're both trying to articulate our notions of reality and I do that and you listen and maybe you have some comments and then you do that and I listened and maybe you have some comments, but together we're building something that's different from what we both came in here with. Right, and in a sense what we're doing is we're participating in the process of articulating each other's spirits and I mean that most technically like part of your spirit is an amalgam of the information that you've encountered. A lot of that is articulated, articulated wisdom and so its sole construction.

Speaker 3:          02:13:29       If you're having a good conversation and that's also conversation that is meaningful and you can tell that when you're having it, it's that you're. You're decomposing parts of yourself, your false presuppositions, you're letting them die and you're letting something new be born as an alternative and you're participating in this process of death and rebirth constantly. When you're having a meaningful conversation, it's like, oh, that was wrong. Honey, let that die. Oh, that's a little painful. I was kind of attached to that concept, but I'll let it go, let it burn off, and a new part of you will emerge and then another part dies and the new part emerges, and that's this process of eternal death and rebirth. It's part of to the general mythology of redemption and you see that all the time too, and the Harry Potter series, for example, at the very end of the Harry Potter series, Potter undergoes a literal death and rebirth and that's how he finally defeats evil.

Speaker 3:          02:14:22       These stories are deeply built into people. There's a reason that that jk rowling became the richest person in England by she's richer than the queen. She got rich by telling the story properly, you know, and the second volume of Harry Potter, when, when there's the basilisk underneath the castle that turns you to stone. When you look at it, that's everything that people are afraid of that freezes you. Like a rabbit freezes when it sees a wolf and the story and Harry Potter is you go underneath the castle to where the thing that fear frightens you the most resides and you face it down and in doing that, you free the virgin, right? That St George, he frees Virginia and the Harry Potter Story and maybe you have died because of that, because he gets bitten by that. Baskets can just about dies and then it's the phoenix that saves them because the Phoenix is the spirit of death and rebirth.

Speaker 3:          02:15:11       These stories, they come up everywhere. There's no avoiding them and it's because they're true, but they're not true like scientific truths. There are different. There are behavioral truth, if are a pragmatic truth or a dramatic truth, and part of the reason that our society is so damn on stable now and part of the reason all this weird chaos is emerging. This is a consequence of niches observation back from the late 18 hundreds about the death of God. We blew the metaphysical foundations out from underneath our culture and the whole thing is shaking and twisting and it's. It's vacillating between the horrors of the extreme, right and the horrors of the extreme left. It's been doing that for 140 years and we're in the throes of that. Again, we blew the metaphysical foundations out from underneath her culture and we need to get them back. Part of the reason that people are so obsessed by things like the avengers movies and superheros and Harry Potter and all of that is because, and Star Trek and star wars is because our, our collective imagination is trying to regroup at the level of drama and reformulate our fundamental metaphysics. I was reading this thing that was talking. They were equating crossfit and yoga to religion and they were saying it's essentially religion for people that have abandoned traditional religions. Is that the idea is that we'll receiving is camaraderie or and discipline

Speaker 4:          02:16:30       discipline and some sort of a shared community experience. So when you're talking about when you're saying your religion, you're not talking about a literal translation like a guy actually came back from the dead. Well, you're talking about is the concepts and the thoughts and the harmonious frequency that is achieved when people follow the tenets of that religion and live by these laws. As you were saying of stacking on these ideas, is this good for you? Is it good for the community? Is it good for the community in five years, in 10 years, and in that, that that's what you're saying when you're talking about,

Speaker 2:          02:17:07       well, you're believing love, relationship thing about that is that like imagine that there's, there's a pathological mode of being that so terrible that when you enact it, you just die. A good drug addiction will do that for you. If you had pursued that meth addiction, pursue that for about 10 years, you know, and you'll descend to the lower levels of hell and then you'll die. Right? Well, so then you might might say, well, what's, what's, what's at the opposite end of that? What would be the final manifestation of a mode of life that was revivifying and healthy? How, how, how, how redemptive and rejuvenating would that be? And I would say the answer to that is that we don't know. We have no idea and these ideas of death and rebirth are definitely true on the micro level, like so. The developmental psychologist Piaget said, for example, that when you incorporated new information, however you did that learning or conversation that that new information would exist in in contradiction to something that you already presumed and so that thing you presumed would have to disintegrate and die and and then something new will be born.

Speaker 2:          02:18:09       That can happen at different levels of analysis, so sometimes you learn something minor and sometimes you're shook to your bloody core, you know, and and you undergo a descent into the underworld fundamentally, sometimes even a descent into hell. That's where you get genocidal and resentful and then maybe you're lucky and you pop up reborn. Well, those, those exist as, as constant metaphysical truths that that's how human beings transformed. We don't know the upper limits of that transformation. We have no idea what that might be because I don't know, for example, how healthy you could be as if you were as healthy as you could be if you straightened yourself out completely. I don't know what, what your. What limits you could transcend and neither does anybody else, so we don't know the upper limits of the truth of these religious stories. Now we do know what happens if you let go of them too badly. You end up with something like the Soviet Union or Mao's China, which were both based on. I mean, they, they, they were atheist, man. They were secular. They were, they, uh, that they dispense. You know, for Marx it was religion was the opiate of the masses. It's like, it's not like, I don't understand that, I understand that, but it's another one of those situations where it's like religion is the opiate of the masses. Yeah. And it's also 50 other things and you don't want to forget those. Like really we know for example, from studies, religious

Speaker 3:          02:19:28       belief as a human universal. And the reason for that in part is because there is a distinction between good and evil and there is a distinction between good and bad. Otherwise you wouldn't do anything like you're always striving for the good. I mean, unless you've taken a malevolent turn, it's a natural impulse in human beings to make what is better. While it means we have an. We have a deeply inbuilt sense of what constitutes better and we're all aware of that harmonious state that's achieved well. Well, yeah. No. The thing that's interesting about it, like one of the things that need your thought was after he announced the death of God was that people would be able to create new values and Carl Jung took issue with that. He was a student of niches and he pointed out basically that, well, wait a minute, who says you can create your own values?

Speaker 3:          02:20:14       You can't even get yourself out of bed to go exercise in the morning. You're not under your own control. Maybe we could discover maybe we could rediscover the values that we once held and that's the descent into the underworld and the resurrection of the father. That's what happens in Pinocchio. For example, you know when Pinocchio goes down into the depths to face monster and revitalized his dead father, there's a reason that movie was made in the 19 thirties and why it was so popular. It's like you want to have. You want to get rid of your damn strings and stopped being an erotic jackass. That's what this story's about is you go down to the bottom of the ocean. You find the thing you're most afraid of. You face it, you rescue your dead father from the depths and you rise back to the surface with him. That's what our culture has to do. That's what our culture has to do.

Speaker 4:          02:21:02       Now, when you say that your religious person though, people automatically assume that you know there's, especially in this country, the religious right, there's a very, a dogmatic and very simplistic view of what God wants and the. I mean it, it, it, it, it's lumped into no homosexuals, a certain restrictions on the behavior of women. That if you look at the Bible and the Bible is obviously a reflection of the people that lived at the time where it was constructed. Although even trying to figure out when that is, you know, an oral tradition for thousands of years before it was ever written down, written in ancient Hebrew, translated to Latin and Greek and Roman or and I'm English rather.

Speaker 3:          02:21:47       Well, there's always a tension in religions between the dogmatic element in this spiritual element and conservatives technically speaking, tend to tend to Marshall themselves on the sides of the more rule oriented and dogmatic elements of the religion and liberals roughly speaking, tend to Marshall themselves more on the spiritual side

Speaker 4:          02:22:05       and that's because of the distinction that you were saying earlier about the behavior patterns of people that

Speaker 3:          02:22:11       conservative conscientiousness versus openness. Roughly speaking, and I mean the dogmatic structures are necessarily necessary. The dogma is necessary because it conserves the structure, but a spiritual aspect is necessary because it updates the and there's always this tension and there's a tension in people. It's like you have to believe things are. You couldn't exist. You couldn't act. You have to hold onto the dogmatic structure of your belief, but you have to be open for its update on a continual basis and that's well, that's basically what consciousness is for that. Seriously speaking consciousness is the thing that attends to the unknown into the anomaly and integrates it with the structure and there's meaning to be found in that too. That's, that's to boldly go where no one has gone before. You know, in the, in the words of the Star Trek Writers and something that deeply appeals to young people when they watch that sort of thing.

Speaker 3:          02:23:03       But so what the fundamentalists are doing is they're trying to hold onto their tradition and it's no bloody wonder because if, if the tradition falls apart, you end up isolated and drowning in the ocean alone. But if the tradition gets too intense and restricted, well then then you're just clones in a prison. And that's these. That's these two, two forms of hell in a sense. They meet, you know, if they get extreme enough, they meet the hell of absolute chaos and the hell of absolute order. And, and the Conservatives tend towards the hail of absolute order and that and the left liberal types tend towards the hell of absolute chaos. There's some point in the middle that's the line between Yin and Yang by the way, because that's order and chaos and the Dow is say, well, that's life. That's existence. Order in chaos and order is the place you are when what you do works and chaos is where you are when what you do doesn't work and no matter where you go, order and chaos exist and your job is to be right on the border between those and that's to live in Dow, that's to live in meaning and that's that same place where all these things stack up and so well on.

Speaker 3:          02:24:13       So with regards to religious tradition, on the one hand you have to maintain the tradition. It's like maintaining the constitution in the US. On the other hand, you have to be awake and alert because the tradition is a dead thing, right? It was composed by dead people in the dead past. It can't respond as flexibly as it should to the demands of the present. That's up to you and you do that with your vision, with your capacity to see and with your capacity to, to articulate and forever forever really the major deities that mankind have produced Marta, for the Mesopotamians oh, cyrus or horace horace for the Egyptians and and Christ for the Christians and Buddha for the Buddhists. These [inaudible] have been people who are noted for their vision, for their ability to watch and pay attention because there's nothing more important than the ability to pay attention, pay attention and speak the truth, your truth, and that's how you keep everything stacked up in order harmoniously.

Speaker 3:          02:25:11       That's how you keep the balance between order and chaos. That's how you articulate your being. That's how you revivify the world. That's how you rescue your dead father from the bottom of the ocean. That's how you adopt your responsibility as a citizen. That's how you live a proper life and a proper life. I know what a proper life is because I thought about this for a long time. Life is suffering and suffering can make you resentful, murderous, and then genocidal if you take it far enough so you need an antidote to suffering and maybe you know you could think, well, I'll build walls of luxury around myself and that'll protect me from the suffering. It's like, well, good luck with that because that isn't going to work and maybe you could build a delusion and live inside that, but now it's going to fall apart.

Speaker 3:          02:25:56       Well, what is there that helps you fight against suffering? That's easy. That's the truth. The truth is the antidote to suffering and the reason for that is because the truth puts reality behind you so that you can face the reality that's coming straight at you without becoming weak and degenerating and becoming resentful and wishing for the destruction of being because that's the final hell. The final hail is your soul wishing for the destruction of everything because it's too painful and you're too bitter, and that happens to people all the time. Now, as a person who is someone who's extremely critical of ideologies, a lot of people would think it's a contradiction for you to embrace religion because religion being the biggest and oldest ideology ideology is a parasite on religious substructures. You can't look. We could go back to the Harry Potter example. That's a good example.

Speaker 3:          02:26:55       I mean, jk rowling had kids reading like 400 page books, right? She could fill a stadium when she was reading. Why is because she got the archetypes, right? She got the religious sub narratives, correct. They're not ideologies. Ideologies work because an etiology is a parasite on top of a religious substructure and a religious. A religious narrative has has a particular set of characteristics. It's very balanced. So for example, there's the feminist idea of the patriarchy. While the religious idea of society has an evil patriarchy notion built into it, that would be the dying king. The once great dying king. You see this in the Egyptian story of Osiris, for example, who's eventually chopped up by his evil brother. You see it in the lion king with a, with a Fossa and a symbols. Symbols farther in symbols, evil, evil uncle, those are the two representatives of the patriarchy, the wise king in the tyrannical king in a religious story, properly setup archetypal story. There's, there's the natural world, the chaotic world. There's a positive element and a negative element. There's the social world, there's the wise king and the tyrannical king and there's the individual world and now it's the the adversary and the hero. There's always a positive and a negative at each level and it stops it from being an oversimplification because it says to you, well, of course society is oppressive.

Speaker 2:          02:28:22       Patriarchy, but it's also the wise farther that has taught you to speak every word you know. It's like you don't get to say only this part of the story without having gratitude for this part of this story, and it's true at at each level of the representation of properly balanced story is how has got the balance between positive and negative. Always correct. Is that in many ways, like a lot of people who are anti western capitalism are also the only. They will find that capitalism in western capitalism in particular is the only culture that is embraced the acceptance of people like transgender people, people who are gay, people who are marginalized. I mean Western capitalist society is one of the very few cultures that openly oppose racism. Right, right, right. Well, and these people are anticapitalist on their iphones. Right. You don't get to do that.

Speaker 2:          02:29:20       Right. It's a performative contradiction. So that's so important. Yeah. They're on their iphones while they're flying. Yeah. Yeah. Capitalists. It's like, well, actually no, you're not. You're just deeply confused as what you are is deeply confused. It's not capitalism. That's the problem. It's evil. It's a problem. It's. Well, it's also the deeper probe it evil is a problem. So there's a religious scholar named Mercy Eliana who looked at flood myths because there are flood myths all over the world. God gets fed up, floods everything. It's like, just like in New Orleans. So here's a funny thing about New Orleans. What caused the New Orleans flood or hurricane? No, no. How about human corruption? How about the corruption of, of, of the state. How about the fact that people knew the dam, dykes, we're going to hold that the levies weren't going to hold, how about that? They knew that for 100 years and didn't care.

Speaker 2:          02:30:10       How about that? They pocketed the money that should have gone for the repair. And so in flood myths, you always see two things. You see that I'm paraphrasing, say there's a storm, there's dykes, and there's people responsible for maintaining the dikes. Well, the storm will wipe out the city, it could, but if the dikes are high enough that it won't, and if people aren't corrupt and they build the dikes properly, and so god floods the world when the dikes have rotted and the people have become corrupt and it's a very old story and it's disseminated everywhere. And the reason is as well, we inhabit a, uh, a social structure that's old and, and, and, and dad, our infrastructures dictate our, our, our political, economic and practical infrastructure has decade. Why it's old everything to case, okay? Everything's already always decaying. That's dangerous and corrupt. People don't do a very good job of keeping an order. And so if things get old and decayed enough, and if people get corrupt enough, then God floods the world. Why? Because that's what happens over and over and over and over and over. And you don't mean in the literal sense

Speaker 3:          02:31:20       of the word. You mean God as these are the consequences to these types of actions. You are not prepared for what you transcended reality. You could look at it that way. You know? And, and I mean the idea of God is a very, very complicated idea, but you could say if you were thinking about it merely merely from an intellectual perspective is you could say that God is what transcends your knowledge. That's all. It's just, it's what you don't know. It's what's outside of your knowledge structures. And there's a very old story, and this goes all the way back to the Tower of Babel, is that one of the things that characterizes authoritarians is that there's never anything outside of their knowledge structures. They make their notes structures absolute. So in the Tower of Babel, human beings build this structure that's supposed to reach all the way to have it too.

Speaker 3:          02:32:05       So that we can invade the place of the gods. Well, God has none of that. He just blows it apart and throws people all over the world. And it's a very early dramatic representation of the danger of human hubris. And hubris is we know everything. There's nothing that needs to be left outside of what we know. It's like, no, that's what God is. God is what's always outside of what you know is the problem with the term God though the people think of God as being a man, they think of it being a person. They even use the masculine pronouns in reference to God. I mean, that's one of the funniest things about God is calling him a he. Well, it's an APP problem. I mean, and, and that's certainly been a problem. Young talked about that a lot about the, the exclusion of the feminine within the domains of Classic Judaeo Christian thought.

Speaker 3:          02:32:51       For example. I mean, you have Mary who's, who's a kind of a cause identity, who, who pops in sort of like as a fourth member of the trinity. But the exclusion of the feminine is definitely a conceptual problem. Um, is the fact that God is conceptualized as a human being or as a man a problem? It's a problem. And the solution, I mean if you, if you remove the human element of God, then God gets so abstract that it's easy for him to float off into space and to never show up again. Can you lose the human connection? I mean the way the Catholic solve that to some degree is that they have God who sort of at the top of the hierarchy and then they have this hierarchy of saints who were sort of like gods but half human and then they have human beings at the bottom.

Speaker 3:          02:33:33       And that allows for a, what would you say, a continual chain of communication between the highest level of abstraction in the actual, you know, the actual concrete person. But, but the other, the other thing that's useful about the conceptualization of God in anthropomorphic terms is that, and this is worth noting, is there is nothing more complex in the cosmos than a human being. So if you're looking for something to represent the ultimate didn't complexity, it's hard to beat a human being. So your brain is ungodly complicated, so to speak. So I mean these things are obviously too complicated to unpack in a, in a. In a way I didn't expect to get into conversation, but

Speaker 2:          02:34:18       I'm glad we did. D, do you think that these stories exist because somewhere in our code, somewhere in our very being, we understand that there is a need for this order to find this frequency so they're sure they're an expression of our deepest being there. They're an expression of how it is that we must live in order to live in order to reach our full potential. Even more than that, more than that, even to avoid hell and you can take the. All you can think about hell is Nazi Germany. If you want, you can think about it as the Soviet Gulag archipelago or Mao's cultural revolution like we can get there. No problem. If you, you walk down in some of the seedier areas in La, you'll see people in hell no problem. Sure. Go to skid row. Yes, yes. And you can tell where the, when those people are there, because they will get angry.

Speaker 2:          02:35:09       If you look at them and you'll, you'll walk a big birth around them. You're not going to come within 10 feet of the, let's call it psycho, geography of their existence. Right, and that they're, they're in a place, it's a metaphysical place, but it's, but it's, it's not defined by the dam geography, you know, skid row is as much of a psychological place as it is a physical place. In fact, it's more that Maura psychological place, but that doesn't make it any less a place and if you're descend into the hell of skid row deep enough, you'll get to the point where most of your thoughts or murderous and that's like, that's, that's hell as a suburb of the underworld. Fundamentally those, that place exists. People visited all the time and sometimes they don't get out. It's real. I've been discussing this a lot recently because people like to talk about the concept of apocalypse, that we're headed towards an impending apocalypse and my thought is that apocalypse is already here.

Speaker 2:          02:36:11       It's just not right here. Yeah. It's always go to Liberia, go to Liberia and look at people, devastating this treats and eating human flesh. I mean they do. I don't know if you've ever seen the vice piece on Liberia, but it's. It's unbelievably terrifying. The whole live there, the apocalypse is the apocalypse is an archetypal idea and the apocalypse is always here and it's here. It's here at the micro level, like when we have a discussion in our concepts change. Those are micro apocalypses, little bits of our being are being blown apart and restructured and that can be happen at a small scale or large scale or it can. It can get to the point where everything collapses and is destroyed and life is apocalyptic in that matter because we all get sick. We all die. You know, our families, our vulnerable. There's an apocalyptic element to being and we and we have to face that and confronted and deal with it properly and, and the wrong way to deal with it is to, is to, is to generate more hell than heaven I suppose, and to do that consciously. And people do that all the time too. There's never a situation that's so bad that there isn't something you can do to make it worse and there's very seldomly a time when you're not motivated at some level of your being to put the knife in and twist it. Just one more quarter turn. People are like that and we have reason. Life is hard. It's no wonder people get corrupted by it. It's not an easy thing to. To live in a.

Speaker 2:          02:37:43       it's not an easy thing to live, let's say in a truthful manner, but, but the alternative, the alternative is hell. I mean, part of the reason that I made these videos to begin with was because, and I learned a lot about the importance of spoken truth as a, as a, as the countervailing force against tyranny and authoritarianism. It isn't an alternative political structure. That's the countervailing force. It's, it's this, it's spoken truth. That's the countervailing force. It's like, well, why would I put my job on the line to have an opinion about compelled pronouns? I know why, because the ability to speak your truth is the bulwark against hell

Speaker 2:          02:38:25       and losing your job. That's nothing. That's nothing compared to where things can go when they go badly. For me it was just preventative. It's like this isn't going in a good direction. Well, should you take a risk? It's like you don't have that choice. You're silent. That's a risk. Now. Most people don't understand the risks of silence. I happen to understand the risks of sadness because I had been studying them for 40 years. Is it frustrating for you to get so little support for these actions and for, for your, your protests? Well, I, I wouldn't say that that's what happened and I don't mean so little support because you're going a lot of support outside of the, in the outside of the university. It's okay. It doesn't matter where the support comes from. Like I mean it's, it's disappointing in the same way that it's disappointing for me to say.

Speaker 2:          02:39:19       I think the universities now do more harm than good. That's disappointing, but. But it, it doesn't, it's not surprising to me. I guess it isn't as if intellectuals are characterized by an intrinsic moral superiority. Oh, they're smart. So they'll leap to the defense of what's right. It's like, no, there's no evidence for that intelligence and and moral wisdom aren't the same thing like and if you're corrupt and smart, all that makes you is way more treacherous. It doesn't make you less likely to be corrupt. It just makes you much more your 50 snakes instead of two or your 56 headed snakes instead of to like I've had clients who were, who had very serious personality disorders, who are very intelligent. It's like that's not necessarily a good thing for them. They're just better at arguing for their pathology to. That is a real problem where people automatically assume that intelligent people are going to be healthy.

Speaker 2:          02:40:19       Yeah, well they're healthy in that often psychological, better in the world, you know, because because their skills are more marketable and so on, but there's no evidence that there's any relationship between intelligence and morality. I mean, God, let me tell you a story man. One time I have this client, this woman was just ruined. She looked like a street person, you know, and she had very dirty clothes and she was so shy that she couldn't even approach you. She had to shield her eyes from you as if you are emitting light. And she did that to everyone on the street, like he was bent over and, and, and, and humble, like a, like a Chinese peasant brought before the emperor, you know. And uh, one of the things I was doing with her and behavior therapy was trying to just get her to present herself in a more normal manner so that people wouldn't shy away from her and be instantly prejudice towards her.

Speaker 2:          02:41:08       And she'd come to the behavior therapy clinic and she wasn't bright. This woman thinks she had only had like a seventh grade education. She was quite intellectually impaired and she lived with her. Her sick aunt who was, who has schizophrenia and who had a, like a, a satanic possessed alcoholic boyfriend that was always tormenting my client. She lived in absolute hell, but she had this dog and she used to take it out and walk the dog all the time. And then she, she'd actually come to the behavior therapy clinic partly because of her own problem. But, but she'd come to this place called the Douglas Hospital and she'd been an inpatient in the Douglas Hospital in India, in the Douglas Hospital. There were these long term psychiatric clients and they looked like something out of a Hieronymus Bosch painting or Dante's inferno. I mean these people were. This is way worse than one flew over the cuckoo's nest. These people were seriously destroyed and they couldn't be let back out in the streets during deinstitutionalization, like they were lifers and she had decided that part of the reason she wanted to come to the hospitalist because she had been institutionalized there and she thought that maybe when she took her dog out for a walk, she could go and get one of those damn inmates and take them out for a walk to

Speaker 2:          02:42:22       now that was a person who is a moral dumb as a post, just screwed in 50 different directions. Nothing going for her. And she had that bloody moral capacity to decide that there was someone worse off than her and believe me, that wasn't easy to find and that maybe she could do them some good. If, if the hospital would letter, which they didn't, by the way. Yeah, well that's the story of the soul. That's not the intellect, that's for sure. So, so I didn't expect any support from my, from my colleagues. And it isn't that I don't care if I got it, but it's, it's in some sense it's irrelevant. It's irrelevant to me because my goal was, I'm not saying those God damn pronouns and the, I'm not saying them

Speaker 3:          02:43:12       is because they're made up by left wing ideologues and I don't like left wing ideology. I don't like ediology period and I know where

Speaker 3:          02:43:23       corruption of speech leads and I'm not going there. And you know, one of the things I tried to learn when I was taking apart what happened in Auschwitz and trying to put myself in the position of an Auschwitz camp guard, which by the way you can do, if you use your imagination a bit, I wouldn't call it exactly the world's most pleasant meditative experience, but you can call up parts of yourself that would be capable of taking someone who just got off a transport train and having them carry a 100 pound sack of wet salt from one side of the camp compound to the other and back. You can conjure that part of yourself up if you want. And that'll teach you something about what you're like. People don't do it because it's too frightening, but I know perfectly well that I could do that sort of thing. And so once I learned that I could do that sort of thing and maybe that I could even enjoy it, I thought, okay, fine. I get it. I'm going to see if I can figure out how to live so that if that opportunity was presented to me, I wouldn't take it.

Speaker 3:          02:44:20       And I think that's the lesson that people need to learn from the 20th century. It's like that's what human beings did. Okay, well we're all human. Okay, so how is it that we should live so that we don't do that again?

Speaker 5:          02:44:31       Well,

Speaker 3:          02:44:32       part of that is to try to say the truth

Speaker 3:          02:44:37       no matter what, because the alternative is worse and it is worse. The truth no matter what. And that is the real problem that you see with being forced into using these made up pronouns. Yeah, absolutely. It's my language all take responsibility for what I say I have not say in your words and being compelled to say your words by law. Well that's that, that, that makes it, that that takes it past the point of absurdity to the point of tyranny in, in my estimation. And I, and I've seen some criticisms where people are saying, you know, he's talking about this, but really he's grandstanding because no one's doing anything legally, but the potential exists such rubbish. But that is one of the arguments. Yes, they wouldn't have changed the damn criminal. They put it in the hate speech category and altered the criminal code. It's as simple as that, and then you could say, well, no, we didn't really mean it.

Speaker 3:          02:45:30       It's like, oh yeah, you did. You really meant it to have the social justice warriors that have debated being the last two months accused me directly of hate speech. All I had to do was poke them a tiny bit and they came right out with it and then the university's legal team reviewed everything I said carefully believed me and they decided that, oh, it was not only illegal to not use these compelled pronouns. It was probably illegal to make a video saying that I wouldn't use them because otherwise why would they write me a warning letter and tell me that I violated university policy on the Ontario Human Rights Act? They did that lightly. Have they acted on this at all? Is there they won't know. Well acted in that. They sent me to warning, reverse and told me to stop talking and the idea that I was going to be teaching in January again because I teach all my undergraduate courses from January to May that was on the table and I think the only reason that it hasn't happened, one of the reasons it hasn't happened and I'm not attributing nothing but malevolence to the university administration because obviously it's very complicated and they did agree to host the debate, for example, but the idea that I wouldn't be teaching in January and still might not be is by no means that was a perfectly plausible outcome and had this not caused a firestorm much of which has emerged in supportive me.

Speaker 3:          02:46:53       Then I would say there was a 50 slash 50 chance that I would've had my teaching privileges revoked, tabbing to other professors. So the idea that I'm making it, I like that this is a tempest in a teapot. It's like, yeah, okay, fine. Why did you change the criminal code then? And why'd you put it under the hate speech laws? Exactly. So no doesn't wash

Speaker 3:          02:47:17       and I. and the fundamental proof of that is the university's response because for sure there are legal team crafted those letters in recalcitrant employee, you're responsible for them. Okay, what do you do with a recalcitrant employed? You write them a letter telling them what they're doing wrong and asking them to stop. Then if they don't stop, you write them a second letter that's more strongly worded. Then if they don't stop, you write them a third letter, even more strongly worded. Then you take disciplinary action. That's like her one on one. That's how you do it. So, so here we said at the end of November, a closing on December, you're literally a a bit more than a month away and you don't know whether or not you're teaching your courses. In January, it seems highly probable that I'll be teaching them. I wouldn't say it's certain, but if I'm teaching them, it's because the cost of having me not teach them would now be too high. It's not because the university believes that what I'm doing is either necessary or acceptable. If someone who's listening to this or watching this feels compelled to act out in your support, how can they do that?

Speaker 3:          02:48:37       I think they could do the future authoring exercise and that that would be the best way to act out and you're, I'm, I'm dead serious about this is like sort yourself out, sort yourself out before you try to figure out the world and the past. That's the primary objective. That's your, that's your most important thing that you can do so yourself out sort yourself out and, and Marshall your arguments and put yourself in order so that when someone pushes you a little farther than you should go, you can say no and you know what's going on

Speaker 4:          02:49:08       now. Yeah, I think that's outstanding advice. That's very, very important advice. And uh, I think this has been one of my favorite podcasts ever. I really appreciate you coming on. I appreciate everything you've done. I appreciate you having the courage to stick your neck out and I appreciate also, you're incredibly well thought out arguments for the, for those actions, so thank you. Thank you. How do people get Ahold of your youtube page? What is your youtube page? Was the Jordan Peterson videos, Jordan Peterson videos on youtube and do you use twitter? I know you put your twitter page out, but you use it so. And that is Jordan, Jordan, b Peterson Peterson, yeah. Okay. Thank you sir. I really, really appreciate it. It was a. It was an honor. Thank you. Thanks for the invitation. Sia.
