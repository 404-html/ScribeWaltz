Speaker 1:          00:01          Freak bitches, like my friend Remy, Remy Warren was in New Zealand and a used one of those and like wrote in the log, you know, where he was from when he was there. And I guess it also, it helps identify if people are missing.

Speaker 2:          00:15          Exactly, yeah. I think it's a safety precaution. So if you can kind of track down where it was the last person seen, you know, or wherever they last seen. So if they were, if they logged into a shelter and then, you know, they can't find them, they can say okay, on this date we know that they were here so you can give a given radius and know that if they are missing their within at least within a certain, you know, 20 miles in distance walking distance of their. But yeah. And I think those things actually turned into like a just fun. You know, some people just go write full on poems in there, some, you know, confess like life stories and they're like, Oh God, yeah. The trail log books are entertaining the doubt.

Speaker 1:          00:53          Wow. Here, warning, what does it say? Harassing Baron Camp Night of 5:11 swipe clause in two tents. Stepped on my tent. Tila collapsed on me. Please be careful he didn't even try to get the food hanging low on a branch here. Oh, look at her name. Flower. Passion flower with a sad face and there's another one. Bear rip. This is a different. This is a different person's handwriting. Bear ripped the bag hanging on my pack, which was hanging on my hammock. I was Muslim. Say Bullshit. Bouncing, bouncing up and down. He stole my toilet paper. Exclamation point. What does that say? Subway. That's his name. Subway. Eat fresh.

Speaker 2:          01:40          Yeah. Ps, the Pivi is great. What's a pivot? Are Pretty. It's the a privilege. It's just like an outhouse. Oh, okay. Compost. Toilet.

Speaker 1:          01:48          How about this one? Dat Shit. Cray all balls. Ghetto savior. Baltimore.

Speaker 3:          01:56          What?

Speaker 1:          01:58          All balls? Ghetto savior. Baltimore. Okay.

Speaker 3:          02:05          Okay. Well you're dealing with like fringe people, right? I mean these are people that are just not fitting into the corporate module.

Speaker 2:          02:17          I don't what what you're talking about with the New York Times and I don't really. I'm not going to step out and take a view on it, but what, what I believe you're saying with the times is that they were pro Clinton and anti trump. That's different from having a position on climate change.

Speaker 1:          02:32          Well, it's not. Well, no, because they have a position on just just take the Lens as climate change. You have one candidate who is denying the reality of climate change. Where? Who's, who's just claiming that the Chinese trump? Well, no, because it won't because when trump says climate change is a Chinese hoax, you have to call him. Here we go. He said it's a Chinese hoax. He should go to China and see those people that are walking around with gas masks on because they can't breathe in Beijing. Okay. But that's, I mean that's, that's the pollution, right? Which I think is actually much stronger because that's just. You can't go to Beijing and say this is how we want the air to be. Right. But I think something like 20, I think something like 25 percent of the air pollution in California on some days is coming from China.

Speaker 1:          03:24          Maybe there's some amazing pr. I could have that slightly wrong. Jamie can check that out, but please do. There's some, there's some extraordinary amount of Arab air pollution that we get from China. That's insane. I did not know that. It makes its way across the ocean. Yeah. Oh yeah, it does. There's no wall build that wall, but. No, but at a certain point, I mean there's some, there's some level of dishonesty and misinformation that's so egregious that if you're a journalist coming at all committed to being an unbiased or disinterested broker of information and a conversation, if you set up a conversation between, you know, the Sean Spicer's of the world or the Kellyanne Conway's who were, have their alternative facts and someone who's honestly talking about whatever it is, climate change, um, it's very, you know, you can't split that up

Speaker 2:          04:15          baby, but I don't think you have to create mock unnecessary debates around climate change. What I do think is that, uh, with the trump administration, uh, that it is imperative for journal that journalists a call out when things are said that aren't true, but I don't think it's constructive for mainstream journalistic organizations to have an openly hostile anti-trump attitude or pro somebody else attitude because then you lead that just leads to further polarization, but when you exactly what we don't need, but you call them out on all the times that he said things that were just absolutely not true. That's like your anti trump. Yes, it can. There's no question. There's no question. And uh, and I think that's, uh, an issue we're dealing with and I, but I think this is a time of real soul searching in my industry because I, I firmly believe there is a very powerful place in a functioning democracy for a press, for, for media that people generally view as fair.

Speaker 1:          05:17          I don't know how they do it, but they figured out how to splice things and change things and selectively breed certain plants and they came up with different strains. That's why corn looks the way it looks. Old school corn was like the size of a Hobos Dick, and it was so naughty and fucked up look, and it was like four inches long. So it's a little tiny thing. It tastes the same. No, I mean it's uh, hobos. Dick. No. Hobos dicks are weird, man. They're so variable. You never know what you get. And it could be a recent Hobo and be like, that guy who punched you. Just old school snot blowing. Veteran Dick. Tastes like battery acid. Those addict. That's through the Pacific southwest

Speaker 3:          05:58          for guys just doing north northwell. Danny comes in your mouth. What do you think that to say that like, oh, guide drinks. Orange juice has come taste better. Have you heard that? Yeah. Whenever I heard that, I was like, how many dicks do you have to suck for you figure that out. You can get away from me. Do you hold this fucking scientists? He's sucking Dick with a lab coat on. Taking notes, asparagus. Not recommended. Switching it around in your mouth. Like you're a wine connoisseur, right? If a guy eats pineapples, if a guy eats pineapples, is cum tastes better. Right? But conversely, if you're just doing nothing but smoking meth, your loads have to taste like hot death. Yeah. And it does. And it's fucking lumpy. Pesticide loads. Tastes like roundup. It's not good when you have to kill it. It's not much either. It's like a fucking Hershey's kiss. No mother fucker didn't. She's immediately tripping on meth. She's out of her mind.

Speaker 4:          07:18          By the time they came back then they were different enough from coyotes that they not only couldn't interbreed with them anymore, but they sort of are mortal enemies of one another. I mean, when we reintroduced wolves to yellowstone in 1995, coyotes had had 75 years and yellowstone without any wolves. I mean. And that served as a wonderful laboratory to study them too because it gave us a sense of what happens with coyotes when nobody is harassing them when people aren't harassing him, which of course we didn't. And Yellowstone Park and when wolves aren't harassing them either. And what we realize is that they create these really stable territory's. They create very stable packs and their population rises to a particular point. The carrying capacity of the landscape based on what they eat, which is mostly rodents and rabbits and things and some fruit and berries, but it doesn't, they don't, their populations sort of levels off and stays at a carrying capacity.

Speaker 4:          08:23          And so we got to watch that happen in yellowstone for like 75 years and it's become sort of the, the example of what would happen if we just left them alone. I mean, some people think, well, if we don't try to control them, how they're gonna, you know, they're just going to be millions upon millions of them running everywhere, but that's actually, they only do that when you try to persecute them and they go into this colonization mode and generate more and more and more pups and have more and more pups survive. So yellowstone in that period from 19, 25 to 1995 was this sort of model of what happens when you just leave them the hell alone and they just kind of rise to a particular population level and are really stable at that level. And uh, and don't really go beyond it.
