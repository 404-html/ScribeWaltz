Speaker 1:          00:05:23       No sound is their song. Jesus fucking Christ. I should've known. I couldn't hear myself. I should've known. Well, it's recorded on here. So the replays, the replays, what happened? But nobody wants to watch the replays. Goddammit. Let's recap what I talked. Hilarious clusterfuck, haircut, pause. We're gonna. Need that one might be in the audio because you hear them well. Let's recap what we're talking about. Well, we're upset here. I said some genius shit. Probably the most profound shit I've ever seen in my life.

Speaker 2:          00:05:58       Anyway. What I said in the beginning, the very beginning was that, um, I'm excited to do these, uh, ustream broadcast and I'm excited that I decided to do it because I liked doing radio interviews and I'm like doing tv interviews and that's all fun magazine stuff was fun, but it's way cooler to just be able to talk to people and answer people's questions directly, you know, and it's, it's easy to get a weird impression of someone, you know, seeing someone on television. The television represent too, to a certain extent. You know, it's like a lot of these guys in the reality shows to get upset like television doesn't, you know, it represents you in little snippets and cuts you up, you know, but the best way to communicate with people for sure is the Internet and twitter and Ustream. So combining the two of them together, what we're doing is, um, we're gonna I'm going to do this every week. The thing behind me, all this bullshit behind me that's all going to get cleared out and we're gonna put up a green screen so we could have like space behind us and shit and we're going to have this thing set up at a little bit more natural angle. So you'll be looking right at us,

Speaker 1:          00:06:56       which makes more sense, right? Yeah. You can put it anywhere you want. You can put it right there. Is that right? In the middle? Yeah. Yeah. Move this motherfucker.

Speaker 2:          00:07:08       But there's the. I got, I upgraded my internet, I had some old ass dsl.

Speaker 1:          00:07:13       It was pretty whack and I got rid of it. Uh, today actually, totally had got it set up. Is this Scorp now? Much better.

Speaker 2:          00:07:23       Um, so, um, the, uh, the DSL is gone and now I got cable and cables, fastest flux, so we're going to be able to air videos and shit while it's going on. And um, my, my mom designed my office purple shades browse around purple. It's a beautiful color. You don't like that color

Speaker 1:          00:07:42       should be fucking black dude with skulls. Like your fucking shirt, bro. There's nothing wrong with purple, my friend. It's a beautiful color. And there's Brian's he, Brian in the corner there. Brian is actually right next to me, but he's getting facebook by that advertisement. You're going to get facebook. You should move yourself up. Can you move yourself up right next to go? That's better because you're not going to it

Speaker 2:          00:08:04       fucked by that. Uh, no. Don't go all the way up there right there. No right number. Let's move over towards my head.

Speaker 1:          00:08:10       Go this way, right? No, that's cool. That's Brian. Brian's right next door to me

Speaker 2:          00:08:19       anyway, we're just talking about the Internet being an awesome. It's the fucking coolest thing ever. I mean, to be able to communicate with people directly like this, to be able to get the answers to any question at any time. To me it's the greatest fucking thing in the world. I spent most of my day staring at a screen reading stories, watching fucking youtube videos and have, I swear I've learned more from the Internet more from just being on message boards than I ever have from, you know, from other shit. I've gotten into all sorts of different subjects because of message boards, you know, and, and wound up being fans of musicians and comedians and people I would have never heard of. It wasn't from message boards. It's like a whole online part.

Speaker 1:          00:09:00       I meet more people online than I do in real life now and I don't just live in my house. I go out a lot more people interested in the same things. I like to get to know him better on the Internet.

Speaker 2:          00:09:11       Yeah, well the Internet allows you when someone posts for a long time, especially a message board community, you get to see how they interact with other people. You get to see what happens when you know they're. They're challenged on their ideas. You get to see. You get to see what they're made of. You know? It's really interesting. Yeah. You would. The way people write is different than the way they talk because people can think they're slick and they could try to bullshit. You buy really patiently scribing out. They're words, but they're not tricking you. Eventually eventually that shit just comes out because they don't realize how douchey they are. They don't realize they think they're not Douchey, but in your writing, the Douchey always comes out. It's like, this is your. It's your expression is almost like a printout of you. It's like, it's like, you know, like your dna or something like that. You know what I mean?

Speaker 1:          00:09:56       Google helps too because then you catch a lot of people. It's the best. It's the best catch clinical. What are you talking about? Check out these photos.

Speaker 2:          00:10:06       Love to talk shit. People love to pretend that they know things. Nobody wants to pretend that they're fucking clueless. You know, everybody wants to be the wizard. Everybody wants to be the smartest man in the world, you know, nobody could just be a person. You know. It's real interesting, man. It's real, it's real interesting. But people love to talk shit and for the longest time they just got away with it for the longest time. People can bullshit. I'm going to text message someone says is just coming in from Shandra, are you with Joe? So any chance of doing a Miami interview, tell that bitch we're doing a podcast. She should know three to five is podcast. I said bitch with the highest level of affection. So I'll just in fun ladies gentlemen. So, um, what do we got here? She checked it out.

Speaker 1:          00:10:54       Any of the photos or videos of that hurricane damage. Have you been here? The earthquake in Haiti. Earthquake? Yeah. I'm sorry, I haven't seen that man heard the CNN thing that I got on my phone. I get breaking important news stories on my phone. The last one I got before this one was that Simon callow's quitting American idol. Motherfuck awful too though. Is it awful movie? If you watch American idol without, that's the only point, a reason to watch it is past people that things that he says. I really. Yeah, right now. So he was Ryan seacrest. Beautiful Hair. Wasn't saying some brutal dude. He's genius. He's a genius. He's hilarious. He's one of the best. Really. Okay. I need to wash it off and I don't have a good opinion of him. My and my opinion of ms dot has always mean to these people that are trying hard to like, they suck, you know, like you can't. I mean, I, I guess he can be mean, but you know, why do it? They're all fucked in the head, you know? I mean, I think it's kind of funny, but that guy puts out a lot of negative energy. Well, he's blatantly honest. He's like, he is, he's not really neat. He's just so honest that it's me. You know what I mean? Like he's really interesting when he says, because like he'll say he's dead rotted percent of the time. I've only watched it like literally

Speaker 2:          00:12:12       twice and one that I can remember when I was so hot. I don't even know what happened, but one I can remember and it was just painfully clueless. People who are just trying to be like the shit, you know, and they'd get out there and they don't even know that they have no talent whatsoever, but I know so many people like that from standup comedy, you know, we all know dudes from stand up comedy who never feel like they're bombing. They, you know, in the beginning you'd have done open Mike Nights. You know what it's like. There's, there's some people in an open mic night, communities that are crazy and they really think they're good and they would love to have an opportunity to do something like American idol for standup. They would get up there and go fucking crazy and be upset and just like those American people are, they get fucking mad. I've seen some people, they, they leave that Simon cowel dude and start fucking crying and wailing and yelling at him. You don't know Shit Simon, you know, they get fucking angry man. Black women especially. Right? I don't even know if black women, especially C to fucking episode.

Speaker 1:          00:13:07       No, I'm talking about. Let's talk about black girls get mad though because I'm not a huge fan or anything, but every time I see an episode I'm just bawling. How hilarious. Wow. So he's gonna do his own show called the x factor. He's basically dual supposedly and so he's pretty much going to leave or why not have Paula Abdul. Are they stupid? They're like, she's incompetent. Yeah, that's part of the fun man. You need to pill that bitch up and just proper up. Just shove a broom up, harass and push her forward and get her in front of the camera. Let her talk crazy. That's part of the fun of the show, right, isn't it? Yeah, I think so. I don't. I had the little clips that I would get, like people send me one of them occasionally, like the one where she said your first song, it was really cool, but your second side and like. And they were like, he only just sang one song, like she's so fucking blacked out of it. You know why she was in a car accident real supposedly, but it's like real pain. Oh, well, you know what happens, man, you, that's what happened.

Speaker 2:          00:14:04       Breezy and tube. No car preseason. Um, got a, a real bad injury and took pain pills. They're, yeah, they're the pain pills or a motherfucker man. I know a lot of people that have had problems with pain pills, you know, people with anything sort of a chronic problem. Well you have to take them, you know, those motherfuckers there grab a hold of you and it's not just, you know, the week or you know, people like that. People have a weird opinion of people that get hooked on drugs, you know. But I've met some Carl prisons, you know, I dunno, I dunno if I'm just saying I shouldn't say Carl because I don't think Carl has a problem with them. I think Carlos and some sort of an anxiety disorder, but I know that he had to take them and it's hard once you take them to get rid of them. I know a bunch of dudes that like need them, you know, like people that have like any sort, a back injury,

Speaker 1:          00:14:51       debilitating back injury and that you get hooked on those bitches. And they get you through the day. I know a lot of people that just need that man, you know, they need them. It's just terrible. And. But what I was saying is the dudes that I know that have had problems with pain pills, a lot of them were like really smart guys that went to college. They're not idiots, you know? Do you have the thing in front of my face? I'm moving. I'm just going to show you this video in a second. Okay ma'am. But you can't do that. It's only been a second. I've seen this. I know I was going to talk about it. Okay. But why do you have it in front of my fucking face? I like looking at myself. Well, nobody knows what the fuck you're doing. Yeah, who cares? It's a fucking webcasts do. This is serious thing. I totally forgot. I was even talking about now what was talking about. Uh, actually I was doing this. You motherfucker. Stupid Bullshit. Tell me ladies and gentlemen, what the fuck was I just talking about? Huh?

Speaker 1:          00:15:50       Pretty crazy about that dog though. And I heard that that video. The dog in the video? Yeah, that was a dog that knew about the earthquake before the people do. That's because people hear shit. They don't pay attention. The dog heard something is probably what the fuck. And the person was like, what the fuck is that shit? He didn't react and then it happened because it was only like a second before it. Here's that video right here. Watch the dog. It just freaked out and ran. I mean, but it was a while before even anything shook. Let's see it again. Rewind it. Here's the dog dogs chilling though. I was like, what the fuck is that noise? Okay. We don't know that. That dude didn't react. This is a stupid video, but this is the problem the dog took off running, but the guy you don't see his face. The guy might've went, oh shit, what the fuck? And everybody is making it like the dog heard this before anybody else. But he felt some. Because if you look at it but nothing's moving at all. Right? But sometimes you hear things before the earthquake. Well you know that's true. You know, it doesn't really start moving until. Let me see it again.

Speaker 1:          00:16:53       Yeah, you're right. You're right. Shit moving. Maybe it made a sound. Yeah, you're right on the ground to that. It's kind of weird. If there was a sound right, a real rumble can still see some fingers monitor. So. So the dogs like two second smarter than a person. But guess what? We got thumbs. Faggot. Good. Sure. Down sleeping dirt. All right. What else were we talking about? Folks? We were talking about some important shit and I forgot about God. Damn. We got a lot of twitter messages coming in this pitch, that mark mcgwire thing. That thing is hilarious. Mark Mcguire is finally coming out and saying, well that's what we were talking about. We're talking about people that are hooked on pain pills. You know that. It's a when when dudes get hooked on pain pills, like I said, I know a guy who's a very smart guy. He was an it guy, went to uh, you know, went to college. Really avid reader, not a, not a fuck up. Has a real. And

Speaker 2:          00:17:50       that's just what it is, man. Dudes. Dudes get injured, something happens to you and then adjust it chemically bonds with your body. I mean it's really incredible with what addiction is, you know, conviction is your, your body is somehow or another linked to something that's really terrible for it and it needs that. Something like it becomes. It's almost like like heroin and crystal meth and stuff like that that really locks a hold of your body. It's almost like they're parasites. It's almost like the drug itself has a consciousness and the drug itself is gonna make you do it as much as you can and all and rob you of life. You know? I mean that's one way to look at like horrible substances. That's why when people talk about drugs, you know, and they like to lump all drugs in together. I love that. That's so stupid because marijuana and mushrooms and psychedelic drugs, if done correctly, can be very beneficial and when they're over you don't feel any repercussions.

Speaker 2:          00:18:46       You're okay if they don't hurt you, marijuana and mushrooms and things like that. The natural things that people have been doing for tens of thousands of years, those things aren't hurting anybody, man, and they can't get into your system, you know, and if you lump them in with oxycodones and fucking heroin and crystal Meth, that's ridiculous. Don't want to. It's becoming a more introspective, fascinating person on crystal meth. There'll become and fucking crazy. It's like we have to look at drugs and in terms of what they do to the people that take them and do the things that do positive things. You can't ignore that just because they're a drug. You're not allowed to just say, oh, because it's an illegal drug than all the benefits that people talk about it. Those don't count. They're invalid just because it's not sanctioned by a group of fucking criminals.

Speaker 2:          00:19:32       That's ridiculous. It doesn't make any sense at all. And you know, I've lived my whole life like this. I mean it's 2010. I would have thought by now we would have come to some sort of irrational understanding as human beings, as we got to be adults. I thought we would come to a point where we would sit back and we would look at things and go, Whoa, what? What right? Do I have to tell another person what to do or not to do? As long as he's not trying to give it to minors or people that don't know any better. As long as people are educated, let's spend money on programs and make sure that people don't get involved in anything fucked up like this and let's pay attention to fucking children in schools. I mean, the biggest problem this country isn't laws and and crime.

Speaker 2:          00:20:10       The biggest problem is why are people creating crime? Why? Why are people doing these terrible things to each other? 90 nine point nine, nine percent of all fucked up. Things become out of a fucked up childhood. You have kids who have either a shitty fucking parents and in these fucking children, they grow up and they're ticking time bombs. If you have a douchebag fucked up drug addict parents and you live in a fucked up place with no love and every day you just see violence and Shit and screaming and addiction and sorrow and there's no way out. You don't see shit. You don't do well in school. I mean what the fuck? That is a ticking time bomb and for politicians to not address that and to spend all this fucking time flying over to Afghanistan trying to chase down 100 Taliban fighters in the mountains and young people are dying over there for that help out.

Speaker 2:          00:21:02       We spend that money attacking the fucking enemy at home. The enemy at home is a horrible fucking childhoods that some of our fellow human beings in this country have to go through. You know, what we really need to do is focus on fucking kids. Focus on children that are growing up in terrible neighborhoods. Focus on fucking schools and community centers and give these kids somewhere to go to when their parents suck. You know, focus on a bunch of people that want to help raise kids that come from terrible situations or help the parents understand what the fuck they're doing, raising children and, and making these kids fucking psychos and giving them horrible childhoods, you know, and then and literally setting loose a bomb setting loose. Someone who's eventually going to turn all their, their inward anger outward and other people or other their pain and resentment and all that.

Speaker 2:          00:21:51       The negative input coming into them as a child, you know that shit is fucking terrible. You deal with a child, the customer positive loving environment, and you're going to deal with a human being that human beings going to come out of that and going to appreciate other people. That's our number one problem. As human beings, our number one problem as human beings is the way we don't appreciate each other, the way we look at each other as competition, the way we look at each other as just people that are on the highway and my fucking way. Human beings have to learn to appreciate each other and we need to learn how to deal with the fucking very obvious shit that we ignore instead of pretending there's some incredible assault on the human race here in America. You know, maybe we should look on what. Where does the real crime coming from? Are the real murders coming from where's the real anger and violence and the shit that affects day to day people everyday. It's not the fucking desert. Okay. It's not the fucking mountains of Afghanistan. It's in cities. It's all over the place. It's, it's children growing up and becoming fucking criminals. That's way scarier to me than some Douche bag in Afghanistan.

Speaker 2:          00:22:56       You know? It's nonsense.

Speaker 2:          00:23:02       Yeah. Someone said Carl and pills. Yeah. That's something Carl's training partner said, but like I said, I don't know if it's true. Oh, all I know is that he's a. he's always been a cool dude to me. Carl is a great fighter and he's got some unfortunate situations and I hope it works out. I liked that too. I'd like to do it a lot. He's good people and he's a bad motherfucker. One of the best judo guys to ever enter mma, you know, he uh, he opened people's eyes to a lot of shit that was possible because before caro nobody was hitting like those beautiful fucking throws. He hits his beautiful shoulder throws and hip throws and his, his judo, like back when he fought like Dave Strasser, like when it was first a UFC bounce. Incredible judo, you know, and it's, that's an whenever get a guy who steps into mma and has some totally something that he's really, really good at that most people aren't like, like Machita with karate, like people will crowd, isn't that good? Credit isn't really work until Machida came along and were treated. Machida is so good at karate. Then he makes karate work in MMA, you know, obviously he knows wrestling and obviously he knows all the other stuff that goes with MMA, which is why it's such a champion. But the bottom line is his karate, his ability to move backward. I mean, he fights like a fucking John Claude van Damme movie and it's, it's pretty bad ass to watch, you know, because until the shogun fight, he really didn't take hardly any damage.

Speaker 2:          00:24:23       What do I think about the United Arab Emirates buying to Suva? Well, I know that the guy who is behind it all is a chic, talked noon of uh, uh, Abu Dhabi and that guy is a huge fan of mixed martial arts and he's incredibly, incredibly wealthy. So you know, that guy can, he can do a lot of good things for mma. That guy, he is a Brazilian Jiu Jitsu black belt under Henzel Gracie, and by all accounts he's legit by all accounts. He's a really good black belt and Hanzo is one of the most respected instructors in the world. If Henzel gracie gives you a black belt, that's a huge honor. So that she talked noon. The fact that he's a Henzel gracie black belt. I know he's been having people travel to Abu Dhabi for years, for over a decade since the late nineties and he had like some of the best instructors in the world that would come and stay with him and uh, he had a whole camp there and you bring guys and you have guys to train with.

Speaker 2:          00:25:19       I mean, dude, it's just the Jujitsu fiend just, I mean like more than way more than me, you know, like, I mean think about how much I love Jujitsu and this guy is like, you know, he's just like, he loves it and he has unlimited resources. So having a guy like that as a business partner in the UFC I think is gonna be phenomenal for the sport. I don't think there's any question that guy is going to without a doubt that God is going to help out and it's going to be interesting to go there. That lives in a castle like a fucking some old school out, you know, Ali Baba Type Shit, right? Yeah. It's even one without the paintings now. Who is the guy that I don't know the sheik has like, I think that the royal family is worth like some insane amount of money, like the one of the most richest people in the world. How about that one of the richest people in the world. That dude is a fucking train killer.

Speaker 3:          00:26:10       Uh,

Speaker 2:          00:26:14       do I think is going to take an active role like Dana White? I have no idea. All I do for the UFC is the commentary. You know what I mean? I talked to those guys and they're my friends, but obviously I've no, no influence whatsoever on the business side of things. It's just my job to call the action. It's a really pretty fucking crazy gig. You know, for me it's like a perfect job because I'm a huge fan of mixed martial arts. Like for real, like I'm not, I don't watch like when I watched the different shows like k one or saying go goo or you know, dream or, or a strike force or anything like that. When I watch those shows, I don't watch those shows for work. I don't, I don't, you know, I don't get on the underground and mixed martial arts that come or, you know, read all the bloody elbow, read all these different websites and do it just for, for fun. I would have done it even if I would have done it, even if it wasn't my job. I'm just a huge fan, like professionally and I'm very lucky, you know, it's pretty crazy gig man. So a lot of fun. It's cool too because we get to go to the fights and you know, be there live and be right in front of the cage. I mean it's just like there's nothing like that.

Speaker 2:          00:27:23       What do you think of the last year? I've seen some good fights, man. Did you see it? Yeah. That Evan Dunham, dude, how bad asses that guy. And he got tagged in the first round, the first round, you know, effort and was all over them. And then Evan Dunham survived and pulled off that. That fucking Armbar was so bad ass. The way did, it was like, it was so wicked. Did he break his arm at all? Uh, no. He did not break his arm. He fucked up his tendons. So lucky for him. It was a. The problem is man, if it breaks, if that. The way that armbar happened, see how his arm, like he was bending it completely at the joint is scary. Kindness the way Frank Mir broke tim his arm because he actually broke the middle of the forearm. He broke the forum and half. That's the scary shit that takes forever to heal and it's usually not the same.

Speaker 2:          00:28:12       They're like, I don't think you know. I think you break your arm like that, man. That's a serious fucking fracture. Like in the middle. I think if you bust up a joint, they get put that together a little bit easier. Take arms and now by now you like metal arms or bones or something, but I don't think they can. I think they, they do hips and they do knees, but once you get a knee that's a wrap. You ain't doing no Jujitsu. Well, this dude named connor, connor human, he's a one of Eddie's top students, a real high level wrestler and his dad was a wrestler and his dad got a hip replacement and his dad still does do Jujitsu and fighting tournament and the dude's like 50. It's incredible, you know, but he has a hip replacement, but he's a fucking psycho and he's a stud.

Speaker 2:          00:28:57       You know the, the average person, you get a hip replacement and that's a wrap. You know? Remember that dude from the Sopranos, he used to walk fucked up. The Fat Guy who turned out, you know he's gay and the and the Sopranos. And he had that weird walk. Do you remember that guy? What was his name? I don't remember that Kai's character. I can't remember. Something killed him. Remember? He was gay. They murdered him. I think they jumped like a fucking a broomstick up his ass or a hundred member pool. Cue up his ass. That's right. Because he was selling a line of pool cues. After that, the dude tried to sell a, a pool cues acute to die for the bottom break. It was like a brake stick. That's ridiculous, but Sopranos told him to knock it off. How hilarious is that as a dude?

Speaker 2:          00:29:43       Some marketing sense got killed. A pool cue. I'll show them those motherfuckers on the qs sales pool cues because they killed them with one of the Sopranos. Greatest show of all time. Right? Oh, I miss it. Got Slower near the end, but I still miss. I, you know, I, I got into Battlestar Galactica for awhile. I like that up until the last season, but the last season I just didn't give a shit about. Last is the only thing that really got me. Like this season I'm still really pumped up to see what the fuck is going on because I watched last. I didn't watch it at all for like the first whatever seasons there were the first three or four seasons or whatever it is. How many seasons have they done? Have they really? Well, I watched all of them from the beginning to the end. All of them on DVD, which is the shit if you've, if you've managed to avoid like Ari did that with the Sopranos.

Speaker 2:          00:30:29       He didn't leave his fucking house, our estate home for like weeks and just watched the Sopranos Dvds watched the whole series to the end. Have you ever done that? No. Only with lost, but I caught up to. They're the ones that were on the Dvr last year. I did like the first three seasons, the sopranos that way. Oh yeah. Seasons of Dexter. I did that way to whole first season. It's the way, but there's another one out. Last year I was like, Eh, this year, this year rather, as soon as I started watching, I was like, Eh, I'm not in this anymore. Or some dude killing people. After awhile I'm like, okay, where are we going to go with this? You know you're going to keep getting away with this. I'm Kinda keeps saying you kill the bad guy every week. Grayling, come on man. This is silly. Did you see that break dancing robot?

Speaker 2:          00:31:13       Yes. How awesome that. How about that fuck robot they created. You see that? That's gross. You see Jimmy Kimmel last night? No, I didn't say that. He was dressed up as Jane line and I heard it was hilarious. They were talking about the mystery here. I'll say right now, I wouldn't see this. Jimmy Kimmel dressed up as a, as Leno, the fucking wars, the war, the war for late night. Listen, fuck. Late night. The Internet is where it's at. Ladies and gentlemen, this is the real connection to human beings. These silly shows where you sit down and you know, ask some fucking 16 year old kid what are new CD is, you know, hey, sign is standing. You got a new shell out. Oh, that's terrific. Who gives a fuck about all that stuff? It's just you're just under the other. There's just people in their pimp and things.

Speaker 2:          00:31:55       People pimp and movies and occasionally someone gives their dick sucked by some crazy cooker or something like that. Hugh grant interview and you'd get an interesting interview or the other dude that the, the, the, the. What's his name? Joaquin Phoenix that showed up. All fucked up. What happened in him? Is He still fucking crazy? I Dunno, but Letterman is the best for taking advantage of those situations. And Joaquin Phoenix either was playing a character, you might've been just doing it for a goof, you know, I could see him doing something or saying it's real. There's just gone, completely gone. It's not hard to do if you're a person who wanted to be famous and you know, your whole life you've wanted to be famous and you've had, you have this need, this hyper need for attention. And then all of a it happens to like, Holy Shit, you know, I'm lucky that the kind of fame that I got like always was.

Speaker 2:          00:32:46       Especially the fear factor thing was like ridiculous fame, you know, like no one's kissing your ass for fear factor. You know, when people come up to you for fear factor, like what the fuck dude? And I'm a. and I was like, yeah, I know what the fuck. But it's not like they love, you know, like if you're like an actor or something like that and you're in some crazy movies, like that guy is the kind of adulation that guy must get. It's insane. You know? And if he was already crazy to begin with that just when, when crazy people all of a sudden have money and people kissing their ass, you know, crazy people are supposed to be like suppressed. Like you split the crazy people. You supposed to see them and go, hey fuck head, you're crazy. But that doesn't work like on the TV show or a movie. Because once you become crazy, it doesn't matter if you're a star, they let you be crazy. So you're just plucking hog wild and doing blow and punching people and they try to protect you as much as possible because you're the goose that lays the golden egg. And that's what happens to a lot of actors. That's where they get fucking nutty. So where's this video here? Wait, Jay Leno. Okay. This is a Jimmy Kimmel from last night. I guess he was making fun of Jay Leno with you. Megan find it. He even did that. Joe It.

Speaker 3:          00:33:59       And they can hear us too. While this was planned. I got to watch it over here because this stupid things on how much the delay is video and video is tight. Sir. You are correct. Chance sparks. Oh Wow. This is from. He's got makeup on and everything. All my guy, he's the backs in my opinion.

Speaker 4:          00:34:41       Me knowing that I'm taking over all the shows and late night

Speaker 2:          00:34:49       music.

Speaker 4:          00:34:50       Great to be here on thing. Always bumped Conan NBC today that said I won't participate in the destruction of the tonight show. Fortunately though, I will. Jimmy Kimmel tonight. He's gone. Don't worry, it'll be fine. Or he picked up an endorsement. Deal with Jenny Craig

Speaker 1:          00:35:37       here. And then here's him, uh, with uh, Chevy Chase. Uh, let's, let's, let's, let's talk to people. What I'm going to keep playing.

Speaker 5:          00:35:46       What is this one from headlines

Speaker 1:          00:35:51       really lame.

Speaker 4:          00:35:55       Find a headline from the paper and then we present them to you, the viewer. And uh, our first headline,

Speaker 1:          00:36:02       that's the list.

Speaker 4:          00:36:05       Vehicles may end drunk and driving. And cigarettes. Man, lung cancer. I should show you this one. Here we go. A service worker. What are they usually hire? Robots. Service workers.

Speaker 3:          00:36:36       Oh my God. Oh my God.

Speaker 5:          00:36:40       Murdering medic.

Speaker 4:          00:36:47       What is the repair of your tornado? What got you into trouble in the first place

Speaker 5:          00:36:59       that's real. Oh my God,

Speaker 4:          00:37:08       a Maltese and beautiful slowly, very, very slowly after the famous pilot flowing flowing burger.

Speaker 1:          00:37:24       Wow. That was brutal. We're on like a 15 second delay is that in case we commit suicide and it's just probably what I'm doing over here. It takes like 15 seconds to see what's happening over there. So if like you're watching someone in the video and a werewolf is like standing over there, by the time you see that, that motherfucker's dead where we'll fuck that dude. A long time ago was a big ass delay here. I wonder if like, you know there's someone watching all the controversial ustream ones and they don't have a delay and they're like right there with a finger on the button if you do something nutty because then the guy commit suicide on, on a web web show. A guy committed to kill themselves all the time. Now at least two people I think. Well that's not all the time. That's a big, you know, when the community is not, you know, we've got to do man. We gotta do headphones. That way we could listen to ourselves and make sure that the sound is good and now I'm watching them now what happened? Watching meters. Yeah. Crazy motherfucker. I'm glad we got this microphone to. This is the perfect microphone, right? Because it picks up everything. You could probably press pause and then refresh your browser if you want to catch up. Really? You think so? Oh, you're right. You motherfucker

Speaker 1:          00:38:50       the Mar Gaydon wow. That's, that's more kate. And do you know more cadence? It's one of the best comics ever. I don't think it's real anymore. Come on man. That's him, dude. He's been saying some crazy shit. He's one of England's pride. The pride of England. He's pretty funny. He's not as funny. Well, funny looking. He's um, you don't think he's a genius? You don't get it. You don't get the material. I just think that, uh, I can't understand a word he says.

Speaker 2:          00:39:21       Hey. Uh Oh. It looks like this guy. David Galloway. G O e w e y says I'm up at 3:48 AM in Abu Dhabi. Now answer some questions. Joe Will. Fuck. Yeah, dude, I'll ask you some questions. You're up at 4:00 in the morning and you live in Abu Dhabi. I got two questions for you sir. What's it like over there? Man? I hear this all like fucking everybody's got a Ferrari. It's like one of the richest places in the world. I've heard it's fucking crazy. Is that true? So recitation real legal there. I don't think prostitution is but I think if you're like, you know, some sort of a ball or character. I mean I think they just ignore it. I mean the way it happens in Dubai, it is like all the hookers just go there. They just know all the rich guys are the rich guys go to Dubai. So hookers was coming from everywhere and I think they just ignore it, you know? I don't know though. I don't think it's legal. Is there any questions on your message board? But I don't, I've never been either will go to the message board shortly, but I want to hit. I want to see what this guy has to say. It is sweet. And he says, David Wood. David, you just chilling in Abu Dhabi. What do you do out there, man? What do you do for a living in Abu Dhabi?

Speaker 2:          00:40:25       Do you have a Ferrari? Do they give you one? You get your driver's license. They'd hit you.

Speaker 1:          00:40:29       Do you like the yellow or the red? You can get a black one too. If you know somebody

Speaker 3:          00:40:39       do do, do, do.

Speaker 2:          00:40:44       Alright. I'm going to go to some questions here.

Speaker 1:          00:40:51       Let's do two girls, one cup video in video that kind of says, yeah, I was thinking about. Has Anybody not seen two girls? One Cup though? I was really going to shoot a horse wine. Oh, you guys want to see Mr Han's. We can't do that. We can't do that. That was upbeat. US broadcasting of ABC. Okay, but then we can't show the shitty thing either. Can we not? We can't do anything like that can be automatically banned. All right. Listen folks,

Speaker 2:          00:41:15       this is going to. We're going to do this for a little bit, but eventually we're going to move over to my website so I could show you guys getting fucked. Death by horses and people eat shit. I did not know that. I was not able to show those types of videos. Well this is not going to last. They let us say whatever they want, whatever we want, but we can't show you whatever we want, which I don't think is

Speaker 1:          00:41:34       going to be any of the stream websites. You won't be able to like, well, we're going to have to either talk to you stream and see if we can say yes to that. No, no one will. Yeah. Because even if you say like if you click on something saying that you are 18 and over, we don't have that. Now do we? Do we have that now where they have to click on something that says there are 18 and over. We should have that. I think that's possible. People probably put it on there. Well, there's definitely do that. I don't want any little kids getting a shitty ideas. I don't want to have to explain anything to. It's not that I'm telling you anything that's not correct. It's just that I don't want to have to sit down with you and go over the way. The world really works.

Speaker 1:          00:42:06       It's too much work with this guy says Alexander wrote says he heard this Ferrari's just abandoned in the street. That's what I'm talking about, man. Motherfuckers got money. It's like, what does that 2007 just piano throw the keys inside the. They give them away to goodwill and raise her phones everywhere. You're mowing the lawn and there's razor phones. Just finding out hitting. I think they have lungs, man. Our guys are. I would like to see. Maybe they do. Maybe they turned into. Well, I think they're going to have an outdoor fight. They're really exploring the place. That's really scary. The Middle East is in a strange land man. It's a strange land. Very different. Yeah. For the people that want to see Mr Hanson and want to know what I'm talking about. Go to a two guys. One horse, one.com. Two guys. One horse.com is the video that I wanted to show you, but I can't because you stream or a bunch of pussies.

Speaker 1:          00:43:04       I guess they want to make money. You don't want to pee. Advertisers pull it out like they do with tiger woods. Pour for poor tiger was a fella I, uh, went to the airport and they still have his posters up for accenture, one of the first companies that dropped him and one of the posters, it's tiger looking like, you know, contemplating a shot and it says something like, it's what you do next. That counts. Put it up on my twitter page. I'm like, man, how fucking telling is that? Did he ever have a fucking inkling of a clue that that's what was gonna happen when he put that picture out? And people are like, people freak out about the tiger woods thing like that. He's a terrible person. And he said, yes, it's not the best thing to do. I agree. But that guy is an, an handsome.

Speaker 1:          00:43:49       He's an unfortunate looking guy. He's very unfortunate looking and he's a fucking billionaire. He's got super, super rich dude. I bet it was impossible for him to say no dollars checks, you know? I mean, if you think, I mean obviously it was a pussy hound. I mean there's no getting away from that. But to be like that guy you know and have all these tens and they're chasing you down and they don't even care if you're married and they'll fly to other countries to hang out with you. Holy Shit. You know, it's like a rock star. He's totally like a rock star and it will then you shouldn't be married. I totally agree. I'm not defending him in any way. He's more of a rockstar. Most rock stars don't have own beverage. Then

Speaker 2:          00:44:32       they'll have their own clothing line. That dude, it's fucking crazy. People love that stupid ass game. They love it. Especially business people. If you want to get down to business, you know, I've heard a lot of people say that if you want to be successful in business, that you literally have to learn golf. Like you literally have to learn it. If you don't learn golf, that he hit refresh

Speaker 1:          00:44:52       screen, show you so you can see why it sat. What's going on? It's gone on inside. Just a picture. That picture you're talking about tiger woods. Oh, what's wrong with this then? I don't know.

Speaker 2:          00:45:09       I mean, when you stream, you're sucking it dummies. I would close your firearm

Speaker 1:          00:45:13       and open up like in safari or chrome, maybe have twins. Shit Open.

Speaker 2:          00:45:18       No, there it goes. It's usually the pictures up filing. See, that's much much of a delay. So like I said, if you see a werewolf behind me and you hear that, believe me, I'm already dead. Okay. Just be kind to be on the message boards. People are brutal about Artie Lange. Man. That was really sad to see how many people were brutal after already laying tried to commit suicide. Like calling them people just like that suicide shit. All right. I know, but it wasn't just that. It was, it was. There were, there were insulting him. Like it didn't matter. You know, you know that he's weak and he's a piece of shit. Like I said about where it talked about the people that I know that have had problems with pain pills. It's not like, you know, the guy likes to jerk off, he jerks off.

Speaker 2:          00:46:02       Two months later, that guy. You need to smack him in the head and go, what the fuck is wrong with you? You lost your job because you jerk off five times a day. You know there's dudes like that. They're like, dear ms.jobs. They, they, they show up late for work just because they're like chronic masturbator. They wake up in the morning, they have to beat off. They don't beat off. They're going to go crazy. Like they get that. That's a dude that's got a problem. That guy's his. He needs a smack in the head. People that are like, like compulsive gamblers. That's a compulsion and that's there though. There's a problem and your pattern of thinking, there's a problem in the way, you know, and I've been compulsive about many things in my life. I understand what it is, I understand the thinking behind it, but that could all be corrected.

Speaker 2:          00:46:37       You just need to learn how to think correctly. There's a big difference between that and like heroin and Oxycontin and math and people who get addicted to shit. That shit's real. That's real. You know? So to get to shit all over someone because they're addicted to a drug man, it ain't easy to kick that. You don't, you know, unless you're doing it, unless you're deep in the throes of heroin, you can't talk shit. And if you have been, and I haven't, so I can say nothing, but I've talked to people who have. I had a friend who, who died from heroin. I knew a couple people that die from heroin. And uh, the one that I knew he was, he was a real, real smart guy. He was, he was a cool dude. He just couldn't stop it. I don't know. I don't. I think some people bond to those dangerous drugs and you're fucked.

Speaker 2:          00:47:23       So whatever happened with him already laying was every time I met that guy, he's always been cool to. And that's how I judge people. He's always fun to be around, friendly, jovial, and he's, I think he's hilarious. He's just a, he's a nice guy, you know, and to me it just made me sad. It made me just the sound of the people were willing to shit on this guy because he tried to kill himself, but you are right. People get mad when people try to kill themselves, you know, especially when people have a much better life than them. You know? I mean, that was the argument that I heard over and over again about already like this fucking guy. You know, what are his problems? He's got a Mercedes and you know he's rich and all true, but that doesn't make you feel better. Unfortunately you'd think it would, but it doesn't.

Speaker 2:          00:48:06       If your life sucks, your life sucks and it really has nothing to do with you. Being rich or poor. Rich can definitely help things because you don't have to worry about your bills and you have less problems. You have a little bit less stress, but then you've got problems with your money and investments and people stealing from you and bullshit. You know, you. Yeah, you have problems all over the place. Definitely better to have it than not, but the bottom line is just because you're successful doesn't mean you're happy. There's a lot of people that are fucking horribly hard, horribly depressed, and they sit around thinking, well, what the fuck is the purpose of his life? You know, and the real problem is, that's a good goddamn question. What is the purpose of this life if you're not here for other people, what are you here for?

Speaker 2:          00:48:45       Because realistically, you know, you get to a certain point in your life like already and I are basically the same age. I'm 42 and I believe he is too. And you know, you get to a point where you're like, you get all this gray like have gray hair and my beard and on my balls I have like 20 gray hairs. So gray hairs coming in here. I mean this is like, you know, your body's dying. So at a certain point in time you got to go, what the fuck is the purpose of all this? What am I here for? You know, and if you don't have like a relationship, you don't have someone you love, you don't have really good friends that you love and you love to be around. You don't have a family, you don't have children, you don't have someone that that you mean something to someone that you feed off of each other and you share energy and you make them feel good and they make you feel good.

Speaker 2:          00:49:24       You know they miss you and you miss them, and that's very, very, very, very important for people and people just underestimate how huge that is. You know, having friends and having family and having good quality people in your life and not douchebags cut the Douche bags out. That is so important because nothing can fuck your life up more than people who are not looking out for your best interest and want you to fail because they're fucked up. You know? Try to let them aware it, let them be aware of it, give them an opportunity to change and if they don't get rid of a condom out of your life. So important, just separate yourself from anybody negative that's going to fuck with you. That can make such a huge difference in the quality of your life. You know? And then of course, get the fuck away from drugs.

Speaker 2:          00:50:10       The bad ones, don't fuck around with heroin. Don't fuck around with math. Don't fuck around with anything dangerous. If you're going to do something, do, do things that people have never died from, and make sure you know what the fuck you're doing before you do it. You know, don't go crazy and smoke the whole joint the first time you know you shit your pants and paranoia. You freaked the fuck out, Yo. You're probably never going to get high again. The first time you ever get high and you should just get a little tiny bit high. Just a little tiny bit of a hit and get used to it. You know, it's like riding a surfboard. You can't just hop on. You'd be awesome at it. No know the feeling of being caught up in the wave of thc when, when when you get really high, it's like you're connecting to like another, another frequency that it's not available to you when you're sober and that's where people don't smoke marijuana.

Speaker 2:          00:50:55       Don't understand. There's an awareness and opening of your mind, and I've had explained to me chemically about Gaba and dopamine and all the different things that go on. There was a recent threat about it on my message board where people are talking about the effect of it, but the bottom line is it does something to the way you think and it opens up new levels of awareness and if you get too much of that, you're going to freak the fuck out, and that's called being paranoid. But what paranoia comes from is this probably the first time you're recognizing reality. You know you're a very vulnerable person. We all our life is, is you know, it's a transient experience. It's gonna. You're gonna pass from this to something else. Maybe. Who knows? Who knows what the fuck. This is the first place. Who knows what the ultimate goal of human racist in the first place.

Speaker 2:          00:51:41       You just live your life and go through it and you put your blinders on and when you have a hit of some really good weed, those blinders just fall down around you and you realize like, wow, I'm this fragile, fleshy little temporary being that's plaguing to the spinning orb has it's flying through the galaxy and people are sitting around talking about John and Kate and, and, and fucking Miley Cyrus and nonsense. And while this is all going on, were hurling through the galaxy and then literally is never discussed. You know, and I have a bit about it. You can see it on youtube. I think it's somebody put it up, it's yours. It's from my, uh, uh, my, uh, shiny happy Jihad CD. It's about flying through space, but that's where we are. I mean, we're, we're just, we're just animals clinging to a sphere in eternity in this gigantic sea of eternity, sea of space. This never ending thing that we're a part of, but we completely ignore and we focus on the most mundane bullshit. Like Tiger Woods, fucking all these girls, you know. And like what else, what are the other dumb shit that people have been focusing on lately in the news?

Speaker 6:          00:52:52       I know, I think why people focus on so much and it's because you know, they need something. It's like kind of watching the same movie over and over again. You know, you need constant new information and stuff like that, you know, like I understand what you're saying like about the whole thing. But uh, I think that's why so many people focused on the dumb shit because the new shit, you know, that same thing. Yeah,

Speaker 2:          00:53:15       that's a good point. So like what you're saying is that the reason why people focus on like tiger woods and stuff like that, it's just because it's new information. It doesn't matter. We've been in space for so long and nothing happens

Speaker 6:          00:53:26       and you look up, you see stars while Blah Blah, shut the fuck up. It's like same cell phone. What would you have the same stuff on for 10 years? Or if tiger woods sell new cell phone came out, would you get the tiger woods and stuff?

Speaker 2:          00:53:37       That's a good point. I think Brian's onto something. I think know, I mean it makes sense because you know, people are, we do, we have this push for new things and innovation and it's literally built into our hard wiring, which is why you can take a guy with the hottest chick in the world and he doesn't want to fuck her anymore. So like you get, you get tired of fucking the hottest chick in the world and that really is true. You know that that can happen. Yeah. If you look at life the wrong way and that's one of the other things that's awesome about weed. If you smoke weed and you fuck your girlfriend, like if you, if you don't usually do that, it's like you're fucking a new person. It's like you appreciate are all for like who she is and what she, what she looks like. You appreciate it all over again. It's really weird, man. At least for me. Do you feel like that when you smoke weed and get with your lady? Yeah. When you smoke weed and get with your lady.

Speaker 6:          00:54:26       My lady doesn't really smoke weed so it's not really that fun. Well, mine can't right now because she's pregnant with me. Bambino. So have you played with the nexus one yet? No, I have not. You're not a fan, huh? Nah, not really. Michael Tech Review Ladies. Gentlemen to. The main problem is, is if you have something like we both have iphones and you have facebook and twitter and all these applications. Why I've had droid. Why have an inferior version of facebook on the droid sucks the twitter on the droids. Not as good as twitter to, you know, everything is just the blackberry. And I have uber, twitter on it. I use, um, I have an iphone but okay. I really

Speaker 2:          00:55:07       use it more of, as like a, um, like a, like a laptop that I keep in my pocket. That's really what it is for me because the bottom line with the iphone, it's, it's on a t and t and a t. and t sucks when, when I'm talking to people on a t and t I can guarantee it's going to cut out three or four times before I get wherever the fuck I'm going. When I drive in my car. I love the fact that I can have both hands on the steering wheel and I can just talk, you know, and I'm having conversations and I can, you know, do business and answer questions and catch up with old friends that I don't have a chance to catch up with. I love that, man. That's been huge to me. To me, that's one of the most important features of communication, the ability to fucking talk to somebody.

Speaker 2:          00:55:44       I don't like text messaging just back and forth after a while, man. You're like, I want to hear your fucking voice, you know, that's, that's the way I like talking to people. You know, it's fun. You know, you can get things out of you, feed off of each other. You know, it's, it's a volley, you're going back and forth. So if your fucking phone can't make phone calls, that's weak. That's weak shit. So I use a blackberry with verizon. No one's paying me to say this, but the reason why I use the blackboard, because uh, we do a UFC is in the UK and the only way you could get a, um, a phone that works overseas got to get a world phone because we have two different systems here in America. We have CDMA and GSM and GSM is t mobile and a t and t and a CBMA is sprint and verizon and there are two totally different types of signals.

Speaker 2:          00:56:29       Well, in other countries, most other countries don't use the CDMA, which verizon has, but it's the best in America and in America it's the shit. It's way better. I mean, I, when I drive to Jujitsu, I would lose people three times with my, at and t phone three fucking times would drive me crazy. But my verizon was right there. That never drops off for a second. It's so much better. But the bottom line is this shit is whack. This, this, this phone is like an iphone from 20 fucking years ago. That's what it's like. It's like some, some cheap knock off, you know, like some third world country, you know, where they make fake watches and shit like that. I try to summarize are pretty nice. The flashes are pretty nice. Yes. Yes. The cameras dope. The uh, the flash is very good. The video is excellent.

Speaker 2:          00:57:15       Yes. Reddit texting videos. Excellent. Is Not bad to type on the uh, the typing. This is the new one. The storm to the double clicking is not bad. It's not just dropped in the toilet. There's, this was right next to my pool, but it's job while I was at the 9:30 club in Washington DC, by the way. I had a good fucking time down there in DC. People. Thank you very much for your hospitality. Awesome. Awesome show. I had a great time. But anyway, I was at the 9:30 club this Friday night and I was pulling my pre-performance Poopoo and uh, I got up and this phone because I was called a piece of shit committed, committed suicide and dove from my pocket into the shitty toilet. It's like, I'll show you a piece of shit is trying to kill data. I know what it's doing because it knows that I haven't backed up in a couple of weeks, has tried to go.

Speaker 2:          00:58:02       I've got some cool pictures and videos on here and there's motherfuckers trying to kill himself. And uh, so I got it out and shook it and shook all the water out. But I tried it with a hairdryer and the bitch came back. I mean it's, it's, it's a great. It's works tire. Listen to your Shit Joe Rogan. It's terribly for anything else. When you try to go on the Internet, you want to shoot yourself, you try to use the twitter function on here it's so clunky and whack and typing is much. It's okay to type like texts, but when you have to type in numbers you have to like really constantly this little tiny ass keyboard where the numbers are and you're always fucking up. Like when I have to give someone, if I'm answering an email and I have to give, give someone an address or a phone number, it takes five minutes because I barely can press down the three.

Speaker 2:          00:58:43       I'm also, I'm always getting the number right next to it. It's, it's really weakened and knowing. So the iphone is shit. It's just so goddamn far above every else, every other phone out there. It's not even close. If you're thinking about you want one phone, if you only had to choose between one phone, you got to go with the iphone. But if you can afford to have two phones, the iphone is great for like a little computer to me it's shoes for pictures and twitters and applications and going on. I'd probably wait until after the apple announcement in two weeks though, is that there's a verizon iphone. If there's a verizon iphone, I'll fucking jump for joy, but I don't think there's going to be one. We think that the verizon thing, what we've read online, because we're both Brian and I are both tech retards.

Speaker 2:          00:59:24       The late verizon thing is, uh, probably going to be some sort of a tablet, like a little, like an internet, like a kindle, but you can get on the Internet with which would be kind of interesting, like a, like a netbook with no keyboard or just an oversized iphone pretty much ever heard or upgrade the gray. Yeah, he's that guy. He's a guy from England that is a, a professor and a scientist who's working hard on a life extension. He's an interesting dude, kind of A. I'm kind of a real eccentric character with crazy long beard and he's got all these really complex theories on how to extend the human lifetimes, like a thousand years. But the only way you would die as if you had a, you know, like got an accident or something or sickness. Pretty Fascinating Shit. The problem is if people live forever, there's not enough room for everybody.

Speaker 2:          01:00:13       You know, we're trying to fuck with nature. You know, nature has us in a cycle and the cycle is very simple. Nobody lives more than like 120 years. If you're the baddest motherfucker ever, you live to be a buck 20 and then you're done and the last few years you are a fragile mess and you better not go anywhere. You know you could tie your shoes and break your back in half. You know you could fall down. You know when you're going to wipe your ass and head plant into the wall and be done. Crack your neck paralyze shell over the floor. I mean that could be the end. It's going to be ugly. You know you're going to be a human role, a tissue paper. That's what you're going to be. So that's, that's the cycle of life. You know, and you have children and those children, you, you pass on your information and that's what's supposed to happen.

Speaker 2:          01:00:59       We are in the, in the active process of evolving as a species and there's two things that are going to aid that involvement or evolvement rather that evolution. It's going to be either technology or it's going to be what we learn and what we pass on. And if you don't evolve, and if you don't pass on something, if your children don't evolve like this, race can't exist from just the people that are alive now living forever. Okay? Because people don't change that much. They, they try, they do their best. But the amount of people that change over the amount of people that don't change, I mean Shit, how many people do you know that get their shit together, that have gotten their shit together? They didn't have it. You know, how many people do you know, not many. Not that many. Most people who are a fucking mess stay a mess.

Speaker 2:          01:01:48       And that's not good. Those aren't good odds for a whole race of humans. You know, I think that the best bet for the human race that we're really care about it as a whole. But we don't. We care about ourselves because we're animals and because we have these instincts in these instincts are designed to make sure that we stay alive and you know, and that's just hard wiring even though your, your logic and your reason would dictate, well, Hey, I'm only here for a temporary amount of time anyway. I need to look at this like what is my purpose here? What am I supposed to be doing? And what you're supposed to be doing is making it better for the next people will you to be doing is making it as good as you can for the people here and leaving an impression so that maybe you can enhance the minds and the open the eyes and set the tone for the next people.

Speaker 2:          01:02:30       You know, if you meet a guy who's like, I mean every time I've ever met someone who's like really fucking cool and really nice and really friendly, it has always inspired me to be cooler and nicer and friendlier. It's like, it's so cool to meet people like that. But you know, when I was growing up in Boston, I knew a lot of fucking hard ass people. I knew a lot of people that were just always ready to insult you and always wanted to fight and I knew a lot of. And if you grow up around a lot of people like that, you, you become like that. Like it can make you like that you live in that environment where everybody's kind of Douchey to each other on occasion, you know, like you go out to a bar in Boston, your chances are you're going to see a fight.

Speaker 2:          01:03:10       You go to a nightclub and Boston to still throw down. I mean, it's one of the few places, like, remember when we went to at least do the, the, um, common connection and faneuil hall and after the show at like 2:00 in the morning, that fucking place would be alive in the summertime. It was crackling. It was crackling. Like at any moment you could see a fucking brawl breakout where dudes punch somebody and fucking tables would start flying. I mean, it was a crazy place. I would hate to look at. Yeah, I mean we, I'm going to fight, so we see them, we saw so many fights and so many close fights. Me and Ram has got in a fight at Mcdonald's. Just waiting in line for the dudes are way more aggressive in Boston than like say if you go out and try to get some something eat in Texas, you know, people are generally pretty fucking friendly. Like everybody has this, like a stereotype of Texas, but you're way safer going out to get some late night food in Texas. Especially like Austin Shit. Austin's bad ass. That's one of the friendliest fucking cities in the country. You know, you want to go get something to eat at 2:00 in the morning and Austin, you're fine. She'll go get something to eat at 2:00 in the morning in Boston. You might see a fucking assault, you know, you might be a part or something. You got to watch where the fuck you're gone.

Speaker 3:          01:04:19       Yeah.

Speaker 2:          01:04:23       Okay, please. Gentlemen, we're going to go to the questions.

Speaker 3:          01:04:26       Do you do,

Speaker 2:          01:04:30       there's gotta be something you're not looking forward to about fatherhood. Well, I'm already a father. I love it. You know what you don't look forward to is you, you, you don't look forward to the fact that you're going to lose a lot of your time. You without a doubt, you're going to have to spend. If you don't want to be a shitty parent, you know if you've had a childhood that was less than perfect, which I think most of us have, right you, you learned from that and you're supposed to be a better person and a better parent from that and once you have a fucking kid, man, it's like, all right, you have this in immense, immense responsibility to raise a human being correctly and you've got to get your own shit together. You know it, it forces you and you're going to definitely have to look at things a little bit differently because you're not gonna have the same amount of free time and you can't look at yourself like you're the only thing you know.

Speaker 2:          01:05:18       That's what I was talking about before with like a lot of people that I know that aren't happy. One of the reasons why they're not happy is they don't have people in their life, you know, like that are really important. You know, like I know dudes that are like grown man that don't even have like really, really close friends. They have friends, but they're like keep shit from them and you know, sometimes they get bad arguments with them and they don't, they don't have anybody that they really open up and are 100 percent honest with, which is really huge. You know, if you don't have like a real friend that you could fucking tell everything to, you got to have those in your life. Man. Those are huge when we're all out. Like when it's me and Brian and Eddie and Joey and we're all out bullshit and we tell each other basically everything, you know, that's one of the fun things about it.

Speaker 2:          01:06:01       You know, one of the fun things about hanging out with people that you really like is, you know, you get to see inside each other. It's fucking the wiring under the board. You get to see how your brain works. You know, you get to throw out the way you're thinking and what's going on in your life to them and see how you know a person who's not living your life but loves you and looks out for you and wants you to be happy. He gets to look at it and see it, and that's very important for people because sometimes you can't see your life objective, Lee. Sometimes you need somebody in your life that that cares about you, and when people don't have that shit, they don't feel like they have that 100 percent honesty with someone. You already are disconnected to the universe and that's one of the reasons why people get so depressed.

Speaker 2:          01:06:40       You know you're depressed because you don't have all this love in your life. You have to have a lot of love and you have to put it out there too. If you're putting out shit, you're going to get shit back and then you're going to get into a downward spiral that you'd ever gonna to put out. Pull out of. You're going to have a shitty life. You're putting out bad energy. It's always coming back at you. You're gonna, you're always going to be unlucky. You're always going to be unhappy. It's just the way it is. If you're an asshole, you're not going to be happy assholes. They look like they're happy because you see them laughing. They go home and cry and drink or their fucking psycho and they have no emotions whatsoever, but no one is happy being negative. Everybody wants to be loving.

Speaker 2:          01:07:13       Everybody wants to have good friends and have a good fucking time. So this operator, Greg, you're not going to live forever, bitch, and you're not supposed to. You're supposed to do what you can to the people that you, it, you influence and touch in this life and hope that it carries on into the next. And we all know this, we all know that, know this inherently and we all know inherently that people have done this to us. You know, like I said, we've all met people that have inspired us. And uh, I think that's what we're here for. I think that's what, uh, that's what we're supposed to do. It's just going to cover what are you playing? Shit. While I'm doing this, while I'm talking. What is this robot? Why you playing distracting shit. Let me know when you're playing shit. Tell me what it is.

Speaker 3:          01:07:54       Okay.

Speaker 2:          01:08:01       It's hard to read the questions off here man. Any plans for a book? Yeah, I'm, I'm, I'm writing a book man. But the problem is I'm writing comedy at the same time and I'm also writing blog entries and I'm also trying to do all my other bullshit so it's some time, you know, it's hard to sit down and just write a book because I sit down and write things and I just want to write about one thing that day and then I like, that's what I like about blogs. I can just write it, throw it up and Bam, there it is. But I'm always looking for new ways that people could listen to my shit, get my ideas out there and get my stuff out there and kids come to see me doing standup and you know, the different ways to do that. You know, it's like book books are legitimate.

Speaker 2:          01:08:43       Wayne's they're wasted. There's still a lot of people that don't even have any idea that I'm a stand up comedian, you know, just because I like stuff that I've done that's not funny, like fear factor and whatever and you know, and doing commentary for the UFC, it's the same thing. It's like there's a lot of people that really have no idea that I'm even a comedian so I try to like do the best I can to use all of the different avenues to get that out there. So I think a book is going to help. And also I think it'd be cool to have something that I actually wrote that book, you know, I just think having a real book in the bookstore is something cool about that book. Takes lots of concentration, smoke more weed. That's excellent advice. I almost always write stoned, you know, and it might not make sense. The problem is greed it when I'm not stoned. I'm like, what the fuck was I rambling about when I'm high? It's all like super genius Shit Dude.

Speaker 3:          01:09:41       Dude.

Speaker 2:          01:09:44       Yeah. I was talking about depression and Brian's playing a fucking robot video.

Speaker 1:          01:09:49       Trying to lighten the mood, Joe.

Speaker 2:          01:09:51       We don't need that man. Is Jason Ellis the best radio show to go on? Opie and Anthony is the best radio show to go on. Jason Ellis is a close. Second pitch was fun as fuck. Jason's cool shit. He's a. he's hilarious too. I love listening to him. He's just a, he's cocky and he's funny and I just uh, he's a cool dude. I like him a lot. I like that guy. He's fun. Too many guys in Boston where in affliction tee shirts. Well there's nice people that were affliction tee shirts to sir. I goof around a fluxion tee shirts all the time, but I were there. Shit. I bought their jeans. I bought their dragon jeans.

Speaker 1:          01:10:28       You're awful. The genes are. Genes are little much, but I got some dope ass. Um, these uh, Japanese.

Speaker 2:          01:10:34       He's a Samurai ones from affliction does this shit man. The whole, the whole like a mythical, uh, it's, I think it's called heroes and demons. It's bad ass. It's like Samurais flight and tigers and shit. And it's really cool art. But there's a Japanese tattooist but they don't make them anymore. But I told Tom Tom Selection like those shirts and shit. I love them. I used to, before I smoked weed, I used to dress terrible. I think address bad now

Speaker 1:          01:11:02       have leopard print stripes, structured shirts with like I used to where things were really. I used to wear like crushed red velvet shirts and crazy. But I'm not choking crazy big Hawaiian shirts. I'm a fashion retard. Like I always have been, you know. And that's why I still wear a fanny pack, like her wear a fanny pack all the time, you know, whenever we travel I wear a fanny pack and a belt chain. Yeah. And my chain, my wallet chain. Okay. The wall chain, you know, watch there. I've lost my wallet before. I don't want to lose my wallet again. Bam. I got a wallet chain. Nope. I like it. I like it. I like it. I like it too because a imperial rose collection. My man, David Tademan, he made it for me. He said to me, this dude's that's really cool dude. Who's a big MMA fan?

Speaker 1:          01:11:47       Who's a jeweler? And He sends me, so to me it has power. It's like a gift from somebody, you know. So it's this cool chain that I like. It gives me strength and I liked it. I'm not gonna lose my fucking wallet again. People are stupid. You feel good for to. You go to bed with her tonight. I like wear my baseball hat backwards. I like having a wallet chain. If you think I look silly, could make fun of me. I don't care how have you gone without wearing the lock chain from like I've never. I've waited a while chain for decades and that's what I can't remember the last time. I didn't wear a wild chain when I was on fear factor. They used to make me tuck that shit in. And it's weird because there's not many of you, you know, there's not many wallet chain diesels.

Speaker 1:          01:12:26       I don't give a fuck. I like it. Do you ever run into any other wallet team? Would use a little compliment each other on small chains. They'll do dudes look at the chain of. Yeah, that's pretty bad ass man. And Dana White Gimme a dope ass one, so I wonder if you send it to you if you would have a laugh. Dana White's given me to wallet chains. That's so cool. Dana white is. But this is the one that I use now and I can't wait. I can you see it? Yeah, I like it because it's a. it's all like handcrafted mass. A little dragon head and the little dragon head opens up and that clips on my belt. Has it changed? Is Dope chain. It's really cool. And for whatever fucking reason. Okay. This shit is metal as fuck, but it does not go off when you go through the metal detector.

Speaker 1:          01:13:07       I was stupid. Or metal detectors. I will fucking kill you with this. A tripod on the plane, but you can have a fucking chain. Yeah, I this thing, this thing goes right through the metal detector. It's weird. It's crazy. I mean you really have to think like that. I mean, I hope I shouldn't have opened my mouth. Retards from TSA is watching this, those fucking knuckle heads. Some of them are cool. I ran into a lot of cool people at the airport, but the laws is what's not cool. None of it makes any god damn sense. You know, put a Goddamn comp on a plane, on every plane. Don't they already do that already? Well, not every claim. She can't bring a pool cue on. You could bring a skateboard, but you can't bring a pool cue and a laptop. You can have a big Mac and you could have a laptop that you designed purposely to free people up. Totally. Totally. Yeah. It's totally worth it. Shut up before we and making sure we get it all taken.

Speaker 1:          01:14:07       So how is Washington? Washington was bad ass. Washington DC show shows. Great man. We were at this place called the 9:30 club. That's where I told you my phone fell and toilet. Awesome. Awesome crowd. Really? I don't get to dc very much and they. The last time I was there before we was with John Heffernan, Charlie Murphy when we did the maximum comedy tour. So you're in Miami Beach, Florida next week, right? Yeah. I'm in Miami Beach, Florida on the 22nd. Which is what is that, and if I was looking at right now it is a front page writer who will put the little calendar on Youtube. Yeah. So next Friday. But Bam motherfuckers, that's another place I'm not at very often. None. Florida very often. Not in Miami very often, but I'm here Friday pictures actually fund that comedy Shit. I guess there's going to be a lot of people in town for that.

Speaker 1:          01:14:55       You're making a lot of comics are going to be in town for that. Yeah. Yeah. That sounds cool. Awesome. Powerful comedy festival. And uh, tickets are selling really fast. So if you want to go, I'm a go to where they were fucking uh, uh, I think that one is. Do we have a lake somewhere? Yeah. You know what, I'm going to throw the link on twitter because I'm such a bad ass bitch. That's what I was going to talk to you about. What? Uh, it's through live nation said you're going to live nation.com. Each ticket they are charging 17 like something crazy, like $15. Like live nation, get to cut service, charge $15 service charge for three tickets. Some was saying that he was paying something like insane, like 200 bucks or something. Yeah, go check it. Let's actually do it. Well, you know, that's one of the things I like about like a regular goddamn comedy club or regular comedy club was the ticket cost.

Speaker 1:          01:15:48       Twenty five bucks. You walk in the door and you pay your 25 bucks and that's it man. You know? Or if you show up early you can go to the box office or you can order online. You just buy it from the club and that's what it costs. You go through an agency, but if you're going to do like a big concert or something like that, you have to go through an agency that's another world. You know, once you start doing like big venues started doing like several thousand people. That's, that's a totally different world. That's why I love comedy clubs. That's first of all the shows better. The shows are always better when it's like less than 600 people, you know, once you get over like 600 people, they're still fun. There's still a lot of fun. You know, DC was more than 600 people I think, but there's still, it's still a good time.

Speaker 1:          01:16:29       Don't get me wrong, but it's just not the same experience. The same experience. You get into comedy club, it's like you're right there, you're in the mix. There's low ceilings and shit and it's just 300 of you and your fucking around just hanging out. Okay. Three tickets gets to try to get the grant here. Tell me $159 and sixty cents. Three tickets. A lot of money, man. Have I smoked weed with Doug Benson? Probably don't remember though. I must have a. might not. Although I think I did once. I think I showed him the solo pipe was going to get them on. I think Doug's very nice guy. Yeah, he's a real cool guy. Very nice guy. And he did his podcast. He's very fun to.

Speaker 1:          01:17:14       He's got a um, I love movies, podcasts, but I was totally useless on it because I'm not a big movie fan so they were bunk and they were all going on, especially patent patent as well was on and he's a movie freak and they were just quoting all these weird obscure movies and weird and I just didn't know anything. I was useless. They were like, what's your favorite movie? I'm like, oh, I don't have one favorite movie. I don't think I have a favorite movie man right now it's Avatar. Just because I, I never get fit. I've never felt like that before. You know, I like in a movie like wow, like that movie, like even though it was dumb, you know, even though it was like Cliche, it didn't matter. It felt. It felt so powerful, you know? It goes like moved to tears almost a couple of times. It's like me, even though it was still, it was like comic book style, Super Powerful, you know, the images and the way it was done, even though there was something, some cliche shit in it doesn't matter. Fucking awesome. Did I get my Tomahawk Pipe? Yes, I did, sir. Actually there is right here, but we haven't used it because it's kind of weak. It's very clogged already. Yeah. Well it's just, it's a. it's done. It's done. You're not really supposed to smoke with supposed to me. I've got to calm a hog. Maybe it's a silly,

Speaker 1:          01:18:38       but yeah, I got it. I got it. Just so I could show you guys. I got it. When did I start smoking weed? I didn't start till I was like 30 years old. That's why I'm so passionate about it because my whole life, I thought that if you smoke weed you'd be lazy. You'd be a loser. Because I knew a lot of dudes when I was a kid and the guys that did drugs, the guys that were partying all the time, they always want to fuck fucking their lives up and I was terrified of fucking my life up. There was my number one fear was being a loser. My number one I didn't mind. My ambition was all fucked up because it wasn't that I wanted to be happy and I wanted to, you know, find some place, have some point of success and do you know, uh, achieve some goal or you know, be the something for a living that I wanted to be.

Speaker 1:          01:19:19       I wasn't doing that. I was just trying not to be a loser. I was terrified I was going to be a loser. So, um, you know, I think, uh, I think that's very important to have the right mindset. I, you think like when you're growing up, I'll try to answer that. Yeah. I think it's a lot with parents, but also, you know, just how you were raised and the whole package and how people, how the people around you think too. That's very important. You know, I don't even remember what I was talking about, how high we are. There's a gentleman barbecued what we were talking about, something real simple. We're talking about Avatar. And by the way, I find myself saw three d and I loved it at fucking navy was so great. Was the greatest movie ever to me. I said I don't have a favorite movie, but I guess if I had to have a favorite movie,

Speaker 6:          01:20:09       any news on Brock Lesnar?

Speaker 2:          01:20:11       Um, I heard randy couture. So He's back in the gym. That's awesome. You know, more important than anything even as dude never fight again. You know, maybe he doesn't want to fight anymore. Now you know, the most important thing is that he's healthy and the most important thing is you ladies and gentlemen, learn something from this situation, eat your vegetables. It's very important to each of fiber and you got to clean out your intestinal tract by juicer. This motherfucker's been juicing, juicing like crazy and it's been, his whole life is like invigorated. Right. Gotcha, Gotcha.

Speaker 6:          01:20:43       Oh, it's been like five minutes after taking one of these juices. I feel like I could just go do jumping jacks.

Speaker 2:          01:20:49       Why isn't this whack ass thing streaming anymore? I don't know, man. I just forward to support soccer.

Speaker 6:          01:20:55       Uh, I use chrome now.

Speaker 2:          01:20:58       Oh, this is, this is firefox. You know what? I'm going to try to shut this.

Speaker 6:          01:21:03       I've been using chrome a lot lately. I like criminal law. I think it's the best so know better so far. He's the best I gave up on Firefox. Firefox has been a worse lately. Firefox has just been slow as fuck. Really needs to be good.

Speaker 2:          01:21:20       Yeah. Firefox crashes sometimes on me. Shut up for Fox. I got all my fancy new fucking bad ass quick internet. It shouldn't be on gate out. A lot of people got really mad at me. I did an interview recently and I talked about, uh, the use of the word faggot. I was just explaining how, what happened when I did the spike TV thing that they told him that I could say any word except faggot when, when the show was uncensored and I was like, this, that's so crazy because I'm not even talking to a person. I'm talking to a dog and some aunts, that's when I use the word faggot and it has nothing to do with sexual orientation, you know? And I know Louis C, k a actually has a bit on that, about how it never met gay. And it didn't. Anthony Cooney and talks about it all the time on the opiod, anthony, about how fag it never really was a homosexual slur when we were kids.

Speaker 2:          01:22:11       It was, it was not. I mean, but that's true, but it's so sort of not true because you knew that it also meant that, but people didn't use it that way. That's not what it meant. And at the end of the day, like what's language is supposed to represent is the context of your thoughts, you know, and the problem is when words get hyper powered, like cunt or nigger or Faggot, now faggot. It's like the new one, you know, or love. Love's a hyper powered word too. You know, these words get hyper powered and the word itself is more important than the meaning behind the word. You're not. It's not a true expression anymore. Like I mean a lot of people in relationships and you know, he say you love me, tell me you love me to love you. It's like this weird fucking magic word thing that you have to say.

Speaker 2:          01:22:58       It's like you should know by the way someone communicates with you whether or not they love you. It shouldn't have to say this one word shouldn't have all this goddamn power. You know the same thing with the word nigger and the same thing with the word Faggot as a now I guess because this gay guy told me when he was explaining this to me that I couldn't say Faggot, you know, even if I didn't mean anything, it didn't mean gay people. I couldn't say it because I'm not gay. He said, but gay people could say [inaudible]. He goes, it's our nigger.

Speaker 6:          01:23:24       Well, of guys who is a kiss of John's protests, some duty met on the streets. Wow, that's shocking news. TMZ. Well, it's great to be sued. Who's Kissing A. Obviously it's staged ladies and gentlemen. So this one's not staged for a where he's getting into an airplane, kissing another gentlemen.

Speaker 2:          01:23:44       Well, you know, maybe looks kissing gentleman doesn't mean he's gay. Brian, I don't know where you're going with this. Listen, just because John Travolta is kissing mounties photos

Speaker 6:          01:23:54       and what did the audience said? Dude was, you want to say which, and John Travolta is Gary than a room full of Dicks in Vegas? One of my favorite things here. Well, clearly I was

Speaker 2:          01:24:07       just saying it in jest, Ladies Gentlemen. I do not know who's homosexual. There's a funny story that I've told before, but uh, it's true story. There was a dude who was a fighter in this organization, so other fighting organization outside of the UFC and uh, this was like the nineties and they want to do a. wasn't a google search even it was an internet search on this man's name because they were going to write a story about him to promote his show. And as they were searching him, they found out that someone with the same name was a gay porn star and not just a gay porn star, but the winner of the hungriest bud contest, not the runner up with the hungriest spot contest fucking winter. This dude one, the hungriest but contest and they didn't believe it was him. And then they just started searching more and they found photos and they found photos of him.

Speaker 2:          01:25:02       Like one dudes in his mouth, one dude on his ass, and they're using them as like a Chinese finger handcuffs and they found all this porn on him. Like the guy it was, you know, it was used pretty easy to find, you know, when the information first got on the Internet, porn was the first shit to get out there. Porn was there before anything else before wikipedia, before youtube, porn was there. So if you had porn on the Internet, like you could basically get even stuff that was illegal, like the early traci lords videos, you could have got those elite, they could have got those back that you can't get those now. Like you'd go looking for a traci lords video now, anything that's illegal like that, that shit is gone. But back then you could get. So gay porn, it was all over the place. This poor fuck. They pulled up all these pictures and videos and everything. Nick in front of them. And he was like bullshit. But, and then they showed him the photos and you got all angry and he was the headliner. He was the big draw. And uh, he just explained that he looked, he was down on his luck and it was a lot of money. There was a lot of money. And so he did it. Well. It turns out he did like 100 movies.

Speaker 1:          01:26:05       And the joke is how much money is a lot of money to you because if I think you do one movie, you live like you're in a Jay z video for the rest of your life. That's what you want to do. Gay Sex on video. What? That's, I got to see some Zeros. I got to see a lot of commas and Zeros. But this fucking guy did like a lot of these. And the joke was 115 videos.

Speaker 2:          01:26:29       By my accounts, you should have all the money in the world. It should be no more money left for anybody else unless you like it. See if you like socking decks and if you're gay then that's not bad at all. There's no see this when people don't understand like just because someone thinks it's funny because they personally are not, they don't want to have gay sex. That doesn't mean it's bad that you have gay sex. It's only bad for someone who doesn't want to have the gay sex. Right? Brian? Like if you're not gay and you do a gay porn, that's a big deal. But if you're gaining do a gay porn, it's like so up. You're sucking dicks. Is it any more embarrassing that you're doing a video? It's the same. It's no different, but if you're straight and you're out there blogging guys on video.

Speaker 3:          01:27:14       Oh,

Speaker 2:          01:27:17       I stupid about it. My Act that if a guy is like straight and he's blown a guy, you know that if you like made a mistake one night and day like you'll never win an argument ever for the rest of your life because as soon as you get in the argument, as soon as shit starts getting real, now you don't even believe people were on the moon like didn't you start a dick once and that's the end. The arguments over. There's no way you can bounce back from that, but what? You got a dick in your mouth, it's conversation's over. You can't trust the judgment anymore. You've, you've defeated him. You've deflated him as a human.

Speaker 2:          01:27:53       Do I feel very blessed to be as famous as I am, says genuine evil. 80 six. That's hilarious. Um, yeah. I'm just famous enough where it's not creepy now I'm just famous enough where no one takes me seriously. First of all, the fear factor was definitely a blessing in disguise because, you know what I'm saying? Like, you know, you get to a place where like, a lot of people are like real super famous people that are like loved and worshiped, you know, rock stars or Michael Jackson or something like that, or Tom Cruise or Brad Pitt, like their prisoners. Like they can't go anywhere. Like that is a terrible way to live. Like, yeah, everybody is fascinated by you, including me. If I saw Brad Pitt in a restaurant, I was like, point stare like me. You want to hear something crazy? Me and Kevin James. Okay. And Kevin James is fucking famous, right? That, that Goddamn. I'm Paul Blart Mall cop movie. He did made like $200, million dollars. Okay. And Kevin and I are in Boston and we're in a hotel room and Tom Cruise was in Boston too. And Tom Cruise on the street. Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:28:52       And Kevin's fucking hotel room. And Kevin's like Tom Cruise is out there. Look. And so leaning out the window looking at Tom, we're on

Speaker 2:          01:29:02       the 10th floor and Shit and Tom cruises on the ground floor. And we'll like looking at him across the street like, Woo, I'm a movie star is Gawking at another movie star. It was pretty interesting to watch. I was like, you're, I go do you know you're that famous. Like he's not as famous as Tom Cruise, but he's fucking really famous. I mean it's silly that he's like so fat, but that's what it is, man. People, people are, are, are nutty about, about fame. That's not a good level. You don't want to be there that you want to be at the level where you don't have to worry about your bills and you, uh, you know, you're able to do what you want to do. Like as far as creatively, you know, that's what I liked. I liked the fact that I could do comedy, I can do the UFC, I do what I want to do and I'm enjoying myself, you know, and it's fun and people enjoy what I'm doing and you know, you develop fans, you develop people that are appreciating what you do and you appreciate them and it's a good relationship.

Speaker 2:          01:29:51       That's good level of fame. You don't want to be, you know, you don't want to be somewhere like I was. I was watching some video online where the guy. Can you put that video up, the dude when George Bush went to a restaurant and he's with five secret service agents and the guy is screaming and yelling at him, you fucking murder or Zionist murdering piece of shit. And some Guy George Bush senior has to. The dude is like, he's an old man. He's been around forever. He has to travel everywhere with these bodyguards everywhere he goes. He have secret service guys surrounding him and yeah, I know what you're saying. Yeah, no, he caused wars and he's responsible for all these people dying. I see it 100 percent and it's not like being a movie star, but it's the same thing in as far as like, well, no, because people are angry at him.

Speaker 2:          01:30:36       Okay. My point is terrible, but it is right because people were angry at him. I mean he's the reason why he's got all those people around because people want him dead. Everybody wants Brad Pitt dead is fucking crazy. But the point is, any level of fame, you know, past a certain level can be. It becomes a handicap. It becomes like food. If you have some food, you should only eat until you're not hungry anymore. You shouldn't fucking gorgeous self and go God damn crazy. You know, it's very difficult to manage any level of fame and to manage the kind of fame that those guys have managed. I mean, it's almost impossible. That's why. How, why do you think Tom Cruise is so crazy? You have to be crazy. No one cannot be crazy if you're that famous. It's like impossible. Like who can manage that kind of thing?

Speaker 2:          01:31:20       You know, like when, when he was on Matt Lauer talking about psychiatrists and antidepressants, like you're Glib, your Glib, like he doesn't even realize how retarded he sounds. No one tells him, no one tells him that he's talking nonsense. He doesn't have a voice of reason around him. He doesn't have objectivity, doesn't have anybody who talks to him real. He has people who gawk and stare and look like Kevin James and I from the 10th floor of a hotel, Tom Cruise. No one's given that guy the real shit. So when he gets on television and talks with nonsense like he doesn't, he has no idea what nonsense is. He's crazy because he's super, super famous and it's like almost impossible to not be crazy. We're all. The rules are completely different for you than they are for everybody else. The rules for everybody else or most people have to create an impression they have.

Speaker 2:          01:32:04       You meet someone that you know, you tell them, you know what your name is, what you're all about with him. Everywhere he goes, they know everything. They know he's the same tologist. They know he's the greatest fucking, most successful movie star in the history of the world. I mean, that fucking guy can't go anywhere. Everybody wants to say he's like five foot one and oh, he's gay and he's fucking crazy and everybody's staring and scrutinize them. You know that marriage that he had, that first one, that called and that was all set up and I was on a real. Everybody's constantly up in a shit. How could you not be crazy? Right? Yeah. Brian gets a. He gets a lot of internet fame. You got a lot of Weirdos. They get upset at you. You got a lot of weird. How about that Pepsi Spice thing? Listen, listen, this story, this, this dude, when Pepsi guys remember when Pepsi Spice was around, well Brian is like one of the Internet gangsters. He was like, he was aware of Shit. The companies weren't aware of. You know, companies were like these multi, multi billion dollar companies, but there really weren't deep in the Internet. They didn't understand the impact it had. So when Pepsi Spice came out, they didn't have Pepsi Spice Dot Com. So Brian Bought Pepsi slice on and Brian started putting up all these crazy because it's still up. Or did you get sued?

Speaker 6:          01:33:16       Uh, the website? Yeah, I let it go because I was tired of paying for it and they weren't bringing back the. Did you give it to them? Uh, no. I just let it go. Somebody picked somebody else pick it up. But what did you do with all those, those crazy stories that you wrote on it? I will tell everybody about the stores pretty much. I just copied off that Morgan spurlock guy and I, I said that I was going to drink pepsi, Pepsi holiday spice for 30 days. What are the people that don't know? That's from supersize me and ate Mcdonald's for 30 days. It's a documentary. Pretty good one. Yeah. And so, so, uh, I had, I could only have pepsi spice to eat and drink for 30 days, which is alone. The dumbest thing in the world that anyone believed it, you know, like I'm not going to eat food.

Speaker 6:          01:33:57       I'm going to, you know, have. So that started having like the first couple of days they started having these lesions and stuff like, can you photoshop these things on fake things? I made myself look more and more sick. I was losing weight and I was telling him like my photoshopping fat off me and what's crazy is then I started getting interviews from radio stations thinking it's real and I have it somewhere like this two hour interview where a college radio station. It was real. And uh, I had people actually I started really thinking I was like dying and stuff like that. And then one day I stopped like 20 days in and people all thought I died.

Speaker 2:          01:34:36       It was one of the great trolls. One of the all time. Great trolls. Yeah, it was really brilliant. Yeah. Just look up Pepsi spice projects, but something's gone. Goddamn brilliant. Trolls on the Internet, you know, the best is Doug Stan hope on Baiting, baiting.org. Doug Stan hope would go and bait pedophiles and then right, like I think they did a about it. Then they do a book, they put it in a book form of thing. Yeah, I think so.

Speaker 1:          01:35:00       I believe it's still available on, if you go to Doug Stan hope.com, you'll probably have a link to it somewhere because one of those, one of the funniest things that doug ever did and he would pretend to be a little girl and Laura pedophiles and say like all kinds of fucked up shit and it was really, really genius stuff. I, I don't, I can't pull any of the quotes off the top of my head, but I remember really laughing really hard and wanting to do the same thing, but I don't have

Speaker 2:          01:35:26       that kind of commitment. Doug is. Doug is an animal. He's a pit bull. The level of commitment that he has towards trolling. I don't know. I'm not into like goofing on. People don't know why like that. Like I, I get bored. I mean I, I'll argue with people and I'll make fun of someone but like pretending to be someone else going back and forth for whatever reason. My brain doesn't work that way, you know? I don't know why I don't get into those trolls, but I love watching them like that. Pepsi Spice One. I love that one. That was awesome. And Doug's. I loved them. I just don't. I don't. My brain doesn't think like that.

Speaker 1:          01:36:01       Here's that. Here's when I actually. This is when the first video site did special effects on. Here's the, here's the video from Pepsi spice where it's like one of the first times I did like a real good special bad assets as video and video shit. This is dope folks. Just like we've got a real God damn show here. People can you see it by the way, all the Shit I do. This is probably one of the funniest things I do. This is fun. You know, we look forward to this.

Speaker 3:          01:36:40       Who's that? Good job pushing up. It's me. I'm fucking myself. Pepsi spreads. Oh, this is my spice. That guy that people would think. Chicken Pepsi's. That's hilarious.

Speaker 2:          01:37:22       Oh, that's hilarious. Dude. That's very fine.

Speaker 1:          01:37:26       Have I seen Jessie Ventura's nurse new show? No, I have not. I'm not seeing Jesse Ventura's new show. I don't know shit about Jesse Ventura's new show. I know it's some sort of a crazy conspiracy theory. Sounds awesome. I like conspiracy theories up to a point. My God, dude, Brian's going to pay. You guys want to see his Dick? Can you talk about the music you like? You should listen to phish dead

Speaker 2:          01:37:56       wires. Call what the fuck? My toilet. How do you even know? What is your name? P Q I l e s 24. This is the dude who likes the dead and the fish. Okay, man, I don't get the dead or the fish. I don't get it. I understand that you like it and I would never say that it's not good because it's obviously good to you. You know, I gave up saying some things suck a long time ago when people like them because it occurred to me somewhere along the line that they, even though they suck for me, even though I do think they suck as long as you know, what do I care? As long as it's not promoting anything ridiculously stupid. Well, as long as it's not, you know, reinforcing retarded behavior as long as it's not negative for human beings. What do I give a shit?

Speaker 2:          01:38:43       You know, you think it's good. You like it? I can't get into it, man. I can't listen to the debt on that. I tried, I did this grateful dead experiment where, uh, I tried to listen to it for 30 days, but I was hating it so much that I didn't want to run. I was going to write about it. I was going to read, I was going to listen to dad for 30 days and then write about it at the end. It's just not my shit, but that's okay. You know what I mean? You can like it. But like I was listening to the dead one day and uh, I put on right after I listened to it. I was listening to for like an hour and then I put on midnight rider by the allman brothers and I never listened to the debt again. I was like, are you fucking kidding me man? Are you fucking kidding me? I mean, look, I know some people like the grateful dead and I understand and I appreciate it and shit like that, but, but listen, man, there's some fucking music that there's, there's some music this on another level and in my opinion, the shit from looking for this. Why am I making sense here? I'm looking for the song.

Speaker 2:          01:39:48       Shut the fuck up.

Speaker 3:          01:39:54       Um,

Speaker 1:          01:39:54       I spoke to her damn own brothers, you know, this is a whack ass setup. What is the basic building makes himself. You can't, you're going to get arrested. Huh? You're going to get a right. You could do this. You, yeah. This is a picture of a picture.

Speaker 2:          01:40:16       Oh really? Yeah. You allowed to do that? Well, I mean, so that's the UFC. They'll see the.

Speaker 1:          01:40:23       I can't find the allman brothers.

Speaker 3:          01:40:29       Here we go.

Speaker 2:          01:40:31       Okay. Shut that off for a second.

Speaker 3:          01:40:35       Listen to this shit. Listen to machine.

Speaker 1:          01:40:40       Oh, that's rambling man. That's not what it was. It was midnight rider fucking con. Do I not have that? How is that possible? I get it out of my fucking phone. How do I not have it on my itunes?

Speaker 3:          01:40:55       Oh, there it is. You Bitch. Okay, here we go. What the Hell is gonna? Meet your screen. You're going to hear this immediately. You have to meet your screen.

Speaker 2:          01:41:17       Oh, otherwise it won't play, right? Is that what it is? Well, you're just gonna Echo yourself. Okay.

Speaker 3:          01:41:25       Yeah. Alright, here we go. You know you can listen to the grateful dead all day. That's all good. This plane did terrible. Let me know. I listen to that. Ah Man,

Speaker 2:          01:42:15       I can't go back. I can't go back to the grateful dead. I can't do it. I understand it. If you like it, it's not my shit. I like some rap music. I like seventies music. The midnight ride from the allman brothers. I don't know if it sounded good to you guys. It sounded awesome. So great. God Damn fucking song. Just to some of the shit they did in the seventies, man and stuff just so resonates today, man. You know, you listen to some, some of the sixties and seventies music Zeplin the doors and just there's something about it man, that like when I'm like in a mood, don't want to hear something. Especially if you smoke a joint and you know, you sit in front of a computer, you want to write, I'll put on some fucking classic rock man. It just, it makes you, it just makes you feel more connected.

Speaker 2:          01:43:01       It's just like there's something about that music, like whatever they were doing at the time and they were making that music. They were nailing it. They, it, you know, there's music from that era that doesn't smell at all, like commercial. It doesn't smell at all. Like, like they were trying to, you know, to trick people or do something, thought it was going to be successful. There's a bunch of music from that era that's just beautiful man. It's just a lie. It's like the pure, the purest version of, of musical art. You know, and I think it's because they were all doing psychedelic drugs. I mean, I think there are a lot to do with it. Everybody was high, everybody was smoking pot. They were dropping acid and taking mushrooms and they were coming out with dope fucking music man. And today, still to this day, I mean no one's going to be listening to pop, pop, pop, pop poker face. No one's going to listen to that in 30 years. No one's going to listen. That 40 years led Zepplin will be around in 40 years. Forty years from now, some fucking dude in a spaceship is going to turn some other dude in a spaceship onto whole lot of love. Probably not 40 years. We'll still be stuck on this planet for 100 years from now. That shouldn't be like Mozart. No one's going to remember pop up poker face. I, you remember that right? Why don't you agree? I know it's pretty big song.

Speaker 6:          01:44:13       I think you've just hating on the APP. You liked that song. I think it was okay at the beginning, but I mean the main thing that, who cares about me? That's like my number, a number one song, you know, not every song is number one. You know?

Speaker 2:          01:44:26       Um, what about what people remember it? I don't know. I think that sounds horrible. Does anybody here? I mean, Lady Gaga, she's not bad. She.

Speaker 2:          01:44:37       Yeah. This dude is down, man. Kevin Newcomb knows what the fuck I'm talking about. This is there. The best music, the allman brothers. Just soulful man. There's something about those. When Joey Diaz describes it as the best, those dirty motherfucking white boys. Dirty white boys from Florida. Are you fucking kidding me? Getting that pure heroin able. Are you fucking kidding me? They will play in the real music. Joe Rogan. You gotta get your ideas on ideas will be here next week. We're going to drag them in here next week even if we have to change the schedule for the show and do it at a different time right now because I didn't look at this at all the last time we did this. I have to look at it now. Yeah. I made a post on my message board asking people to put in questions. So uh, because of that I'm going to go there right now and check it out what the questions are and see if anybody has some cool shit because people were upset that I did it last week. But when I did it last week I didn't answer any questions. But I mean, I like the questions and I, it's good to have the questions, but I wanted to make this as loose as possible. I want to make this as much as whatever we feel are talking about, you know, whatever, whoever's here, whatever, just let things come out, you know, and answer twitter questions and all that shit.

Speaker 2:          01:45:56       What are the best tips for navigating a high dose mushroom trip? Are you doing them regularly? I was the first question. I don't do them regularly. I'm Terence Mckenna, who I learned everything I know about psychedelics from that guy, or at least that's where I started listening to what he had to say, reading his books. But what he always said is that you should do them in a high doses. And very rarely, that's what he said. He said that psychedelic experiences shouldn't be something where you do the right dose and then you take a long time off and try to sort of contemplate what happened. And uh, I agree with that. The last time I did anything really strong like DMT, there was over two years ago and it was because it was a very, very, very profound experience and I wanted to make sure that I got as much out of it and they understood it and sort of deciphered it as much as I could and applied it to my life as as I could before I just went to try to do it again.

Speaker 2:          01:46:52       I'm, I'm very serious about psychedelic trips. I don't think it's play. I mean I think you can have a good time of mushrooms with your buddies if you don't take too much, but I think you can get a lot out of psychedelic trips where you. And I'm not criticizing people want to do it for fun because look, I like to drink for fun. Smoke pot for funds. I smoked pot both for introspective quality thinking and also for fun and I don't if you want to do it for fun, that's all good. But what I'm saying is like, for me personally, I've learned a lot from psychedelic experiences, and what I believe is what turns Mckenna has always said is that you should do them very rarely. You do, um, and then you don't do shit for a while and you think about what the fuck you learned because it doesn't.

Speaker 2:          01:47:33       If you really want to prove yourself, you really using it for that reason to really expand your consciousness. You don't get anything out of it. If you can't apply it to your life, you can't just have the experience and then becomes some fucking shut in who doesn't interact with the rest of the world. Because all you want to do is go down in your basement, turn the lights out, and do mushrooms, a curiosity. Now you're not even a part of us anymore. Like you should be able to. You've got to be able to function in both worlds, in the psychedelic world and in this world. You got to be able to navigate both dimensions. And I think if you do too much drugs, if you do them all the time, you know, you can, you can definitely lose your handle on this world. So that's my answer to that question.

Speaker 2:          01:48:13       I think if you're, if you're doing anything consciousness expanding, you know, and always do things that have been done for thousands and thousands of years. I mean, I'm not telling you to do anything illegal, but there's stuff that you can do that isn't illegal. They just haven't classified it yet. You know, Iowasca isn't technically illegal. DMT is illegal. IOWASCA has even been sanctioned recently. Uh, they, uh, some church in New Mexico won a supreme court case where they, uh, they take dmt as part of their, uh, their Christian church. It's part of their religious ceremonies to get in touch with God. Yeah, they want a supreme court case for few people know about it. But you should know what the fuck you're doing. And that's the real problem with psychedelics is that there are no shaman anymore. You know, in the, in, you know, these tribes in Peru and these people that live in the Amazon there, there's like a history of usage that goes back thousands of years and they pass it on from generation to generation.

Speaker 2:          01:49:06       And the Shaman, the people that like brew this Iowasca Iowasca is very powerful dose of, uh, of dmt that comes in an orally active form and they get it from combining these plants and boiling and into this crazy mixture between that. And there's also shaman and other parts of the world in Mexico where they, um, they, they're Sharman where they, their thing is mushrooms. And these are people that have navigated these dimensions, whether it's Iowaska or mushrooms or pod. They've navigated these dimensions many, many, many, many times. So they can tell you what to expect there. They can, they've, they've learned from their experiences and they can help you. You know, I think that's the real problem is that psychedelic drugs aren't necessarily bad for you. They're just illegal. And when they're illegal can be bad for you because if you need car with them and get locked up, your life can get fucked up if they find them on your in your purse, if you have to test for some sort of a job and then all of a sudden you're labeled a drug addict.

Speaker 2:          01:49:57       Yeah. And that sense psychedelic drugs can be bad. And the other sense it's like a circular saw like one those, those are awesome. If you know how to use one, you can build a house, you could, you could fucking do some cool shit. You can cut some wood that you would never be able to cut with like a steak knife. But it doesn't mean everybody should have a fucking circular saw and just be using it all day. And that's the same thing with mushrooms. Mushrooms are just like any kind of tool you can like. Like I said, with marijuana, with a hammer, you can build a house with a hammer or you can just hit yourself in the deck if you're fucking crazy. It doesn't mean that hammer should be illegal. And that's the same thing with psychedelic drugs. I wouldn't give a circular saw to a 13 year old boy and say, Hey, go play with this.

Speaker 2:          01:50:37       But if a guy is a goddamn carpenter and he knows what he's doing and he's Kinda gone up through trade school and you know, it didn't apprenticeship and worked as a carpenter's apprentice and learned how to use tools properly and learn the proper safety precautions, then yeah, that guy should be able to hold a fucking chainsaw. That guy should be able to use a circular saw. That guy should be able to work in a machine shop. He's learned how to do it. And that's the same thing with psychedelic drugs. There should be someone showing you the dangers and the pitfalls and what it's all about because it's not simply that easy. It's not like you can just do them and you're going to be okay. Some people do psychedelic drugs and there's so unmentally prepared for it, but they're never the same again. You know?

Speaker 2:          01:51:13       And that's a real possibility and someone needs to be there to evaluate whether or not, you know, you've got the proper information with your head's in the right place, you know, and that, that's why it would help if we were more open about these fucking things. And it's the nutty thing is it's, it's still got this terrible reputation and here we are, you know, in 2010. And I think the reputation is all based on the fact that we, when we get something in our head, we stick with it and we get something in our head. Even with all the information, like marijuana is still illegal, 2010 and most states it's illegal, you know, it's crazy when alcohol and tobacco and all that shit is readily available. But we get it in our head that it's bad because it's been illegal. All our lives were. It's a very tough for us to change gears.

Speaker 2:          01:51:54       And for a long time we've had this thing in our head about psychedelic drugs. And uh, it's just a cultural pattern, you know, it's just a lock. We got talked into it when the media was young and when the newspapers were around and that was the only way to get information. Now they would publish these stories about marijuana and the William Randolph hearst scandals with William Randolph hearst owned not only deedee own newspapers, but he also owned paper mills and when they invented the decorticator, it made it more effective to process hemp fiber and what he started doing was attacking the hemp industry so that he didn't have to change over his paper mills from wood to hemp paper, because hemp is a far superior paper. It makes superior clothing. It's you. You can eat it like the is. It contains all the essential amino acids and the seeds besides the fact that it gets you high, even take away.

Speaker 2:          01:52:44       That gets you high part. Even the plants that don't get you high at all or still like really economically viable, valuable. Well we'll we'll you ran off first attack that industry because you own the newspapers. He started printing these stories saying that blacks and Mexicans were swept smoking this new drug called marijuana and they were going out and raping white women. And so because of that, because he did this, they all, um, you know, people got crazy and they'll pat got paranoid and congress actually outlawed marijuana not even knowing that they were outlawing hemp. They didn't even know it was the same thing. So that's, that's how marijuana became illegal in the first place. And that's why it's still illegal today is at once something is stuck in our consciousness. It takes a long time to get it out. Well, I think that a long time ago, a long time ago, it was probably very, very common in all cultures to have a shaman, to have some sort of a, you know, someone who is aware of psychedelic states, you know, John, Marco Allegro, uh, he argues that that's what Christianity is all about.

Speaker 2:          01:53:45       Christianity is all about concealing these secrets of consuming hallucinogenic drugs. He was the guy who decided for the Dead Sea Scrolls. John Mark or allegro, worked in the Dead Sea Scrolls for 14 years. And after he did all this discovery, now I don't know if he's right and neither of you, unless you're a biblical scholar, unless you can, you know, you have to be a, a master of ancient languages. You have to study it for decades. Even understand what the fuck he's talking about. I read it, it's like make sense sort of, but it could be totally bullshitting. But what his story is was that the entire Christian religion was a giant misunderstanding. What it really was all about was the consumption of psychedelic mushrooms and fertility cults. And that's what it was all about. It was all about breeding babies and taking mushrooms, which makes sense. People live thousands and thousands of years ago and didn't know what the sky was. They didn't have any science and they're popping mushrooms. They would. They wouldn't want other people to know how bad ass the mushrooms are. You eat mushrooms, you see God. It wouldn't want other people to know about that. So they would hide it in stories. I told them make sense?

Speaker 2:          01:54:43       Some guy said, I've been tried robitussin. What are you kidding? Do Caucus Powell drinking robitussin? What else? Dragon Aftershave, Phil agreed, discusses, hates everything in the radio. I don't hate everything on the radio, but Goddamn, I had a lot of songs. I think there's just a certain reality and it was like a lot of rap and a lot of classic rock. I like soundgarden too. I love sound garden. I heard they're getting back together again, which I love because I was not a fan of that. Chris Cornell Shit I was on.

Speaker 6:          01:55:15       Yeah. Lately I haven't been a fan.

Speaker 2:          01:55:18       He seems like a really cool guy and he's a talented as fuck as a singer, but there's like some bands that get together. They got to a magic, you know?

Speaker 6:          01:55:26       I don't think it. Even if they get back together, I don't think it's going to be that character willing. Yeah, I think. I think a lot of bands like soundgarden, they were good because they were a young and every eight doing drugs and going crazy and just experiencing life now. I think these are just people that have slowed down, slowed their role and they're trying to be something or because their music.

Speaker 2:          01:55:44       Just a lot of these guys as music or I think that was kind of what I was talking about earlier when I was saying that there's a certain level that you reach as a, I'm a performer, you know, if you get too famous, you get too successful. It's very hard to, to, to cope. Very hard to be still creative and still have enthusiasm. I mean, how many guys just get better and better every album. It's not that many know stereo. Hard to pull off. Who Do you think has ever done it the longest? Most consistently.

Speaker 2:          01:56:16       Wells that blend. One of those guys, probably the Beatles did it forever. Right? Did they ever fall apart? They got better, right? Yeah, they did. They got into their psychedelic stage, you know, they're fucking white album stage, better beatles rock band. It's great because he started off like Shitty Beatles songs and you're just like, this sucks or whatever, and then you start getting into like psychedelic and it's just, it's cool. The more you play the more into the music scene. The thing about the Beatles was they didn't just change their music. They changed the whole culture that was listening to them too because people got swept up in their music. People were such huge fans of John Lennon and when he started getting into transcendental meditation and acid and you know, hanging out with gurus and shit, they hold onto it too. Like he changed a lot of people's consciousness.

Speaker 2:          01:57:02       That was a guy that really, really affected a lot of the way our culture operates, the way people think about Michael Jackson to fuck you. Yeah. Yeah. Michael Jackson. Just from the, the, the music, like how powerful it was like bad and thriller, man when I was a kid, there was nothing that was more popular than that. It's like it was so recognized that his talent was just so far and above everyone else's. And you know, everybody's like, God. It's so sad that he's such a freak and he's so crazy. But the more I've been thinking lately, I think that when you get to a certain level, I think there's a certain level of, um, of greatness that some people achieve like a certain frequency that some people cheap and it's almost impossible to achieve. If you're not insane, it's almost impossible to push yourself that far that hard because it's not easy to be like Michael Jackson.

Speaker 2:          01:57:53       It's so fucking hard. It's not just natural talent. It's a focus and an energy and that focus requires like a very singular way of looking at things in a very essential question by sexual abuse and that probably helps to relax in the back of his. What do you think that's what happened with him? You think it was when I was a kid, I think probably. I mean, well, it's all speculation. They all were. He could have been that. He just got so fucked up because he got so famous when he was so young that he never felt like he had a chance to grow up and he wanted to go back to when he was a child and it was just so psychologically damaged that he literally wanted to be around children because he wanted to revert back to that moment in his life before he realized that life was haywire.

Speaker 2:          01:58:36       You know? I've thought that before because you know what the thing is about all these child molesting accusations is that he was always around all these poor kids and trying to help all these kids with cancer and shit and people were who were broke and it's like after awhile, I mean these people, like all they have to do is say some crazy shit about Michael Jackson and you know, it looks weird. Why is my Jackson hanging out with kids all the time? I would say some crazy shit and he's gotta pay you gotta pay. You start going through the newspaper and to these people that were super broke. I mean, that'd be so tempting. Here's this billionaire, the biggest rockstar music star and the history of the world and he's hanging out with your kid. He's a kid. Your kid over for sleepovers and you start.

Speaker 6:          01:59:16       I believe it though in some I've paid him

Speaker 2:          01:59:18       the. What I'm saying is there's not like a whole bunch of people coming out saying he fucked up. You want to just fuck a couple of kids. You'd be fucking kids all over the place. Especially if you're Michael Jackson. You'd be like the tiger woods of kid fucking. You'd be just banging kids all over the place. You would if you got that obsession where you want to have sex with kids. If you look at like trauma masters, like the recidivism rate is through the roof. It's crazy. It's like a 99 percent or something like that. I don't know. It's real. I just made that number up. It's real high though. Whatever it is. I've read it. I don't remember what the numbers are, but the people have said time and time again, it's very difficult to reform someone, so if he's like banging kids, he's not just going to bang one or two,

Speaker 6:          01:59:55       but that's why he had kids and he called the kid blanket because he's always on top of him.

Speaker 2:          02:00:00       That's bullshit.

Speaker 6:          02:00:03       Seriously though. I mean if you're a child molester and you get caught, what don't you have kids? You're just get enough money. Yeah, but

Speaker 2:          02:00:09       no, none of his kids have ever come out and accused him of doing that. You can't just say that you're just,

Speaker 6:          02:00:13       you're adding on now you're making. I'm not saying it's true. I'm just saying, but I'm going to say that's what I believe in. I don't believe me. I believe that he probably slept with kids, but I don't think he's like, fuck, you know, like doggy style on the side of the bed or anything like that. So you think he just did inappropriate shit? I bet he's just because he thinks he's a kid. You know? Maybe I was molested by his father growing up. That would cause. I mean Miley Cyrus would be fucking black by now if that was true. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          02:00:43       Somebody said this. I don't know who said this, but I don't want to not give them credit, but I don't remember who it was. They said that they think that Michael Jackson might've been castrated. They think that at certain point in time Michael Jackson might've been castrated and that's why he can sing at such a high pitch, even though he's a grown man. That might be why so fucked up sexually and it totally makes sense. Especially when you look at his children. Those are not his children. I mean, there were white kids there, 100 percent white and he's a black man. I mean he might've paid for someone to have those kids for them, but they're not as kids, you know, and I think that it's real possible that, that that's real possible, but it's special

Speaker 6:          02:01:19       culation Janet and all them, all kinds of hair, that kind of voice. You know,

Speaker 2:          02:01:23       Tito doesn't. Jermaine doesn't. Those are men. You look at his brother, those are men. Unless he's like some sort of a, a biological freak. Why does he have that voice? Why is he looked like that? Why is he so feminine? Why is his voice so high pitched? Even though he's a grown man? I mean, could you imagine would if. What if? I mean he's so crazy with his fucking plastic surgery. What if he had some bad sexual experiences when he was younger and he just decided to Castro himself?

Speaker 6:          02:01:49       I mean, you look at what he does to his face. That's not beyond the realm of question. I'm just making a fucking rumors. Two hours and five minutes and this to the goddamn rumors show. Folks, what does that, this is my anger to one of these twitter posters. I love those guys. I just to get math, there's like those guys that just trying to get your tag. Look at me, look at me like every five posts. It's the same guy.

Speaker 2:          02:02:14       Australian men can't get hard, man. Oh, can get hard man. Uh, they can trust me. I know. It's funny. I thought that was the whole point. Castrating people, unless you take like you have to take Viagra or some. How do you, how do you. Does anybody know this? Are there any dick experts out there on the twitter? Ladies and gentlemen, please give me some information. Can you really get a hard on after Castro did? Not by natural means, right? You have to take something. It seems like when the balls are whacked out, that's a rap song. That's a rug son. So wrap, son.

Speaker 2:          02:02:51       I'm glad you guys are enjoying the JPG for ps zero. This is fun. It's fun for me too, man. What? I banged a 16 year old. No Man. Listen, you know they look hot. That's a problem. And they're ready to fuck. They really are, you know, teenagers. I mean, I'm not saying anybody should fuck them, but when you see a girl, like when I was 16, when I was 16, I was having sex weren't you? I was having sex and my girlfriend was 15 and she was built like a woman to a woman. She had Turks and she had a big ass and it was a woman and she wanted sex all the time. I mean, that's a, that shit is real. You know what I mean? That's, but you're not supposed to deal it. Doug Stanhope as a joke about it. Me and uh, Brian, uh, me and a are ever talking about it on the plane already told me the joke that Doug said, and apparently Doug said, you know, you know, you say that data that they're 16 years old, they shouldn't be having babies.

Speaker 2:          02:03:47       Well guess what? God disagrees. That's why they can get pregnant. And that's a really good point. You know, I mean, that's really true. But no, I wouldn't have sex with a 16 year old. That's a child, you know. I mean, even if a girl is like 20, like I'm 40 fucking two years old, like I've heard of dudes that are like my age that have like 20 year old girlfriends and everybody laughs about it. Like, well look at that guy he's got, have a buddy that has a wife and his wife's 19, you know, and he's in his forties. It's crazy. But you know what? That's them. The, they, they, they like it and they have a good time to. I have a hard time talking to people, you know, I can't. I mean if I'm living with someone they have to be smart. I'm, I need someone who has some experience.

Speaker 2:          02:04:30       You have to be on the same level as me. And there's something that you denied when you're younger but you realize when you get older is that when you fuck, when you have sex with someone, even though you like to think that it's just physical, you just getting there and you blow a lobe. It's not that simple. There is some sort of a weird connection that human beings make when they fuck. And especially when you do it to someone who's young, like they, we learn how to ignore that connection and we learned how to like push each other away when a little older we learned how to separate and get, you know, just deal with it about physically. But when you're young, like you get so attached, you remember how attached to her the first person you had sex with, Holy Shit. Unless that person's a total douche bag, you know, like you, like it really like hooked on them.

Speaker 2:          02:05:15       Like puppy love is brutal, you know, and that that's what they call a. you're inexperienced in the incredible connection and you as you get older, you learn how to manage that connection. But the connection is real. And if you're a grown adult and you know, you're, especially if you're in a position to take advantage of this kid, you know, they're young and naive and silly and you're fucking them. That's a weird thing, you know. Then again, a lot of 20 year olds are Horny as fuck or they want them to. I'm not telling you what to do, do whatever you want to do. But to me not, you know, girls 18, that's like a baby to me, it's as a little child. I like women, you know, I don't like. I'm old.

Speaker 2:          02:05:59       I don't even like a my urge, but it's women are more fun. I like to be able to talk to people. Don't you? Some dude, Josh Jitsu says I'm 23. Well, good for you. You young little whipper snapper. When I was 23, I was fucking retarded, right? I was a complete and total dumb ass. So I hope you were smarter than me sir. Because a life can be tough when you're stupid, you know? And if we all come from a different place, you know, when I'll have a different, um, a different starting point, that's what it is. You know, some people, their parents are super cool and real open and their dads, their best friend and you know, and their dad was, you know, very educated and intelligent and raise them, you know, very, very smart way. And that person has a huge headstart. Huge, huge, huge headstart in life.

Speaker 2:          02:06:50       If your parents are cool. My parents were divorced when I was a little kid. My, you know, my Stepdad came into the picture when I was seven. He was 24. And imagine if you were 24 years old and you know, actually I was five when he came into picture. You were 24 years old and you have a fucking five year old kid hanging around with you, you know. So if he came in the picture when I was five, then he was like 22, that's young as fuck, you know, to be that young and to be around someone else's kid, someone else's loud ass kid, you know, that's hard to deal with. So a lot of you out there and maybe you my 23 year old friend, maybe you have a headstart, you know, maybe you'll be smarter than me when you were 23 than when I was 23.

Speaker 2:          02:07:32       But I think um, what, what I was talking about recently with a friend of mine was that guys like Michael Jackson or you know, or, or anybody that I know that's exceptional. Almost everybody I know that's really exceptional at anything had kind of a fucked up childhood. I think that's really weird. You know, people that I know that are like all my friends that are really good comics, all my friends that are like really good artists. All of them had fucked up childhoods we doing. Showing the beginning thing again, showing the beginning thing again. That'd be getting things pretty bad ass. I think um, you know, I think it's horrible. You know, that people have fucked up childhoods. But I think there's something, something that comes out of that. Right. You know, like when you're in balanced, it's like your, your ride is so much rockier, but there's so much more energy behind it.

Speaker 2:          02:08:22       It's like if you can get ahold of it and, and control your personality and, and figuring out a way to stabilize it and it's like you have so much more thrust than a person who is content, but it might be unhealthy. Final words, final words. Listen, pitches sign, kind of final words will tell you a couple of these questions in the forums dot Joe Rogan.net website. Before we bail, this is fucking question.

Nobody gives a fuck about that stupid yellow metal. You're going to need bullets. Okay? Yummy food and a place to sleep. It's warm. You know what I'm saying? The fuck are you dealing with gold. Gold isn't worth anything. Pussy and guns. That's. That's all. Those are valuable assets. Cars. That's important. House as important. Preferably surrounded by chain link, fence and dogs. Okay. That's what you're going to need. You're not going to go you dumb. Fuck. What do I think about James? Tony fight in the UFC. I'm a huge James Tony Fan. He was an awesome boxer. Still isn't awesome boxer, but you know, I don't know if he's really into it. If he's really into it. He said, fucking, you know, fucking champion a guy. So good at boxing and wrestling. If you're really. Who knows? Maybe he's been. He's been watching this shit for years. We don't know. Everybody's talking shit. He might've been secretly working on his wrestling. He might have a six bra. If you've got to

Speaker 1:          02:10:34       stand up with that dude and he's got four ounce gloves. He's gonna fuck you up. Oh Damn. James. Tony boxing with you. That guy is going to fuck you up. I don't know how he eats those leg kicks. Leg Kicks. Fuck them up. Get a guy like ray cifo in there with them. Boom, boom, boom. Those fucking thunderous tree trunk leg kicks down on your meat and making your legs buckle. You only took a couple of those bitches and page through yet. No. Well, I have everything set up. So there's 100 images at or 100 posts. Why my site excited about coming to Toronto? Have I ever been? No, I've never been in Toronto and I can't fucking wait. Your wife has nice tits. Maltipoo very nice tits. Aaron told me to say that. He said Tell my wife she has nice tits. She does. She has nice tits.

Speaker 1:          02:11:21       Congratulations sir. I'm reading the page, man. You're not seeing. He said, I'm just seeing if he's reading the page. Really? You had to say that because you didn't want to be bragging about your wife's tits. You know what to say about being drugs, but smoking weed and fucking is just awesome. Being drunk is better when it comes to eating pussy though. Really? Being not in my opinion, in my opinion, being drunk is better when it comes to eating ass because it's the only time I do it because I never even asked when I'm sober. The only time he had asked me sober is when you just get out of jail. So when you're. When you're high, you don't want to eat ass either, but I beat the fuck out of some pussy rental heart. You just, you like it depends. It's Megan Fox asked. I'll eat that anytime of day.

Speaker 1:          02:12:06       Anytime of the day he thought ass talk, Yak. What if it's all poor? Don't care. Either wipe it off and just dive in there. I'll wipe it off with your mouth. I'll start with the hair. Well, that's why I think it's important to drink drinking. The reason why drinking and eating ass goes in hand in hand is the alcohol kills the Cola. I mean when you're drinking jack and cokes and you're eating ass, the alcohol is killing any bad bacteria. That alcohol is flushed your whole system with poison. Nothing's grown in that. No, no bacteria is going to take hold. It's going to get swallowed up in that whole antiseptic chemical reaction that the Jack and coke has. That's why you really think you can eat ass when you're a jack and coke when you're high. You don't want to eat ass because when you're high like this is probably not the best.

Speaker 1:          02:12:52       I never even put like metal in there and it cleans the metal. Did you know that if you take jewelry and putting on a candidate coke, it just dissolves all the face of coconut frog? Yeah. If you take a put a frog in big thing of coke, like a dead frog. It just eats all the skin away and just bone makes it go. Is that true folks or is that one of those? Those do exchangers we used because I heard that the, the taking the paint off cars was bullshit. It's like bullshit. I don't think snopes anyone do. If you, you know, one of the best things to clean your grill is coke. Really? Yeah. Damn a rag. But you know what? The doctors, when you haven't like a fucking barbecue sandwich,

Speaker 2:          02:13:32       a nice goddamn cold cold. It's pretty fucking delicious, right? So barbecue pork pulled pork sandwich. Alright Ladies and gentlemen, uh, I think that's going to be the end. We got to take one more question. So we end on a high note. But, uh, we are enjoying the fuck out of this. Here's this. To disclose your product has 400 witnesses proving ete life exists. Even astronauts. Listen, just because you have 400 people saying that they've seen Ufo, that does not mean there's cfos. That means you have 400 people that say they've seen you have false and they might really believe they cfos, but you know, they have a real problem that hunters have a real problem. And this exhibit, this happens all over the world where I'm the most experienced hunters are the ones that wind up accidentally killing people. And the reason being is that these guys are winning your experience.

Speaker 2:          02:14:21       Hunter, you know that sometimes your window of opportunity where you get a shot at a deer is real short. You've got to be able to react. But the deer's right there, you got to be able to shoot and people see things that aren't there and one of the things they all say a universally when they have an accident, and these are like good people, church going people, no anger, no violence issues. Guys are just loving on thing. They say, they swear they saw a deer. They swear they saw deer. One guy accidentally shot this, um, this woman, uh, in Maine and she had white mittens on and he is following a deer. And this lady was in the woods and she had her white mittens on and he saw that white. And he said he saw the book. He said he saw it. He said it was right there in front of him.

Speaker 2:          02:15:05       And he said he squeezed off the trigger. We don't fully understand how the, our consciousness and our imagination affects what we see. It's, it's still very much. It's, there's something tricky to it. Hallucinations and the ability to see things that aren't there, that's real. And if someone's in a very heightened state, if they're in a very heightened state, like if they're in the heightened state of, you know, of, um, wanting to see a deer, or if they're in a heightened state of being in the woods in the dark, and you think you see a monster, you can see a fucking monster. You can really see it. You can convince yourself that you've actually seen it. If you see something and you don't know what it is, you will turn it into your mind and making a monster. If you're out in the woods and it's Pitch Black and you stumble into a wild boar and you barely see it and it makes noise and runs away, you could, it could be some to, you know, to fucking foot tall troll man with you know, giant fucking furry feet and glowing eyes.

Speaker 2:          02:16:09       You could make something up in your head and you don't think you're doing it, but you're doing it. The human imagination and human memory or not totally to be trusted. So unless they have actual evidence listening to anybody talk about Ufo as you have to listen to them and go, hmm, maybe, maybe I'm not saying that you can't get, you know, hear from other planets. I mean, if you were so sophisticated that you can travel to this world from another galaxy or another solar system, why wouldn't you be so sophisticated that you could hide? Why wouldn't you be so sophisticated that you're, you're Ufo is completely invisible. Why wouldn't you be totally undetectable? Why wouldn't you? I mean, maybe they would just have everything completely master the idea that, you know, they would show themselves and look like they're dangling on a string. Allow people to take pictures and you know, and they all, maybe they wanted us to see them really.

Speaker 2:          02:17:04       And that's how they did it. They just showed up and some weird obscure place where you, no, no, no, no, come on man. No, that's not what they're doing. That if, if there really are aliens, they're probably so alien. You can't even recognize them. They're probably. I think that what we recognize is what we see in our dimension. What we see in our environment, what we see in our world, I think there's probably life forms out there exist that are so alien to us. We don't even have the sensors to detect them. You know, and the way I've talked about this before and I was talking about farts and that by when someone farts, if you don't have a nose, you have no idea. It stinks you. There's literally something going around you that's invisible and the sense that you have tunes into it. How do we not know that there are an infinite amount of things that we cannot detect that are around us all the time.

Speaker 2:          02:17:53       We don't. It's just guesswork because something's not on the same frequency as us. Something's not solid. It's not tangible. You can't bang on it because just because of that doesn't mean it's not real and if there are aliens, they're probably so fucking alien. You can't even see it there. They're probably on a totally different frequency than we are. I'm not buying all these dudes that say they've seen Ufo is because they really want to see you, fos. These motherfuckers want to see it. They have all had experiences and something's happened to them, but they want to see you for they want so bad they've given up on their jobs. They've given up on their careers, they've decided to pursue [inaudible] full time. They make youtube videos constantly. They do conferences and seminars. They have a lot of vested interests involved in the idea of flying saucers and ships from other planets coming to this earth, and there's a lot of psychological things you have to take into consideration like why these people want to see these things and when these experiences happen, that's another thing.

Speaker 2:          02:18:51       People individually experiences, especially alien abduction experiences. Most of those things come in the middle of the night while people are dreaming and when you're dreaming in the middle of the night, your brain is producing all sorts of psychedelic chemicals including dmt. The most potent psychedelic known to man is produced when you're in heavy rem sleep. So when these people are having these alien abduction experiences, how do you not know that it's not your imagination mixed in with psychedelic drugs that you don't even know you're having? You're having these things in your brain is producing, um, and you're having these incredible fucking psychedelic trips and maybe you're halfway into a dream and you wake up and you're tripping out of these chemicals in your fucking brain and you start creating all these scenarios with your imagination. Next thing you know, you're on a spaceship. Why? Because you're in the middle of a fucking natural dmt trip.

Speaker 2:          02:19:37       And if you smoked DMT, dumb people that want money. Joe. Actually, there's this, some people that are done though. There's some people that aren't done that have real experiences. You know, I've, I've, I've seen their interviews, I've read stuff they have, I've read all the John Mac books. So you, some of them, yes, but there's a very, it's, there's no one you can't generalize, but people have had ufo experiences, but the, any, any supernatural, phenomenal, you know, out of the ordinary experience has to be considered in all sorts of different ways. Where's the evidence and what else could it have been? And when you look at what time these things are taking place, almost universally they take place late at night when people, especially the alien abduction experiences almost universally take place late at night. And when these people have these experiences, they're all sleeping, you know, they're all like half out of it and something happens to them.

Speaker 2:          02:20:25       It's much more likely an endogenous dub of psychedelic chemicals. Ladies and gentleman, I'm no expert in my disclaimer. I don't know what the fuck I'm talking about. This is all shit that I've read on the Internet and watch documentaries on and um, learned when I was in my isolation tech stone. Um, we've had a good time here today for either you have a good time. Fifty percent of the time, 50 percent of the time. What didn't you like about today? I've heard a lot before when these subjects come up, a lot of times I've said, I've talked about all the shit many times before, but Brian has to realize there's a lot of people out there that have not seen me talk about all these things before. And when a interesting subjects like this come up, you know, you gotta you gotta address it. I think it's an important thing to talk about.

Speaker 2:          02:21:09       But we had a good fucking time. Thank you very much. We're going to do this every week. Like I said, I upgraded my internet today. Finally it's up. So now I can get a Brian here beside us and we can load videos up and shit. And like I said, behind us, we're going to put up a green screen and when we put up the green screen we're going to be able to, uh, have like a space background and shit. And I got all kinds of cool things coming on. And we're going to do this every week. Fuck it. It's fun. I enjoy it. Next week I'm going to try to bring on my boy Joey Diaz. Maybe Eddie Bravo would join us as well. Maybe I should. Fear will join us. We might not have a whole Party in here because next week I'm going to have a big couch in here. Um, so, uh, thank you very much. I had a good time. You motherfuckers, um, if you, uh, want to come see me do stand up if you're in Miami. I'm at the Lincoln Theater in Miami on the 22nd, which is, I think it's next Saturday or next Friday. Next Friday. Next Friday. Next Friday. The, so a nine days for today. So thank you very much. Everybody wants to play that thing on fullscreen and that's how we'll end. Thank you very much. Love you bitches.

Speaker 3:          02:22:15       See you next week.
