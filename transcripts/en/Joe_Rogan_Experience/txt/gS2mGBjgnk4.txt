Speaker 1:          00:00:07       Experience. I'm always trying to type faster than that commercial and I always fail. So I'm trying to tweet this live in the moment and then stare at it. My, with my ever shittier eyes. Oh yeah. Tell me what am I supposed to tweet it? I'm doing this right now. I just tweeted it. You could retweet it and that way it'll be, but I've tweeted, my eyes are fine until I w I stare at my fucking computer too much. No, they, they get screwed up and then you try to look at the TV and you can't see what's going on. It's guaranteed it's age, but it's also, I don't think screens are good for you. Have you ever like taken a picture with your cell phone of a screen and then you see those lines that you can't say like whatever the fuck those are. Well let's actually just your phones, the aperture on the camera's not able to catch up with the flickering images arise.

Speaker 1:          00:01:01       So then if I'm looking through this screen at that, that doesn't fuck with my eyes and think it's the actual strain of staring at something that's lit up so close to your face that's really fucking with you more than anything. Isn't that correct? Is that the correct aperture? Is that the correct terminology? And you're squinting or you're reading, you're, you're squinting your eyes. You don't even realize it, but that's not what we're talking about. We're talking about the flashing thing. The flashing thing like this, just your camera can't catch shutter speeds that what it is. Um, like if you watch a cars, if you see videos of cars that have LCD lenses, there's something happens when you film them, it looks like they're flashing. It's a different refresh rate usually. Yeah. It's weird. I don't like any of that shit, which is why my new special, I actually did it in black and white because I don't like HD TV.

Speaker 1:          00:01:45       I think it's, I don't like seeing somebody pours is they're talking to me like HD at this point. It was great. And then it got to a point where it was too, it was too real. It's clearer than real life. Like I went to a game at a Dallas Cowboys Football Stadium and they've got this giant fucking TV classic Texas, right? We've got the biggest fucking TV, you know, that means we're the best and it was so clear. It looks realer than what was going on in the field. And you, I had to like pull my at the visor down on my, my, my head cause I kept wanting to look at that. Tony, we're almost like right in front of me. The promoter hook me up with these great seats. He's fucking right there and I'm looking up further away than he is for me looking up at this giant fucking TV.

Speaker 1:          00:02:27       It's also an instinct to look at screens. I see that a lot of the UFC people are, their babies do it. Everybody does. It's an instinct to stare because it's so captivating and we're used to staring at screens. So like if you're at a sporting event and there's a screen there, you just autumn automatically start gravitating towards that screen for some, I look at the screens here, I usually always just look right here instead of looking right there. Well you should, you're actually running shit as supposed to do that and make sure that nothing's, I don't know, demons behind us and we don't know about, yeah, I'm not a fan of a technology

Speaker 2:          00:03:00       electronics. I liked some of it. It just, I feel like all the benefits of it are taken away. And then some with the crashing, with the refreshing, with the, what the fuck just happened with the, Oh, now this is outdated and I have to buy a new one and then I throw this one into the fucking ocean. I go back and forth. I love it in a lot of ways because, um, I'm just fascinated by innovation. I'm fascinated by these new things that these new people keep inventing, but there's also part of me that realizes that a certain point, Tom's not benefiting us anymore. It's not like making our lives easier, it's just making things more connected to electronics. It's making you more into like whatever world to the electronics create. Yeah. Somewhere in the 90s we pretty much could have slat towed here we will fine and even people say, well what about medical stuff and like helping people out and everything, helping them live long and cure disease and everything.

Speaker 2:          00:03:52       That basically kills the rest of us to keep that other person alive and then they're still alive, taken a shit that ends up in a river and it just keeps polluting more and more. We're just, we're like, we've just for all over the fucking place and it really needs to shrink down. Like the technology I don't think would be a problem if they weren't. So everybody has a fucking lapped are so many people have laptops and shirts and all this shit that we just keep buying and then throw it out. Like you know that Paul put litter in its place. You ever think about that? It's like when they pick it up, where do you think it goes? Do you think it leaves earth? It just goes somewhere else. We don't have to look at it and it's just fucking sitting there. What's going to happen is they're going to figure out a way to take everything that we make and turn it into either a product or turn it into fuel.

Speaker 2:          00:04:34       Like whenever we make something and we have to throw it out, it'll just become fuel for something else. Do you know how many people would have to agree just to even get that ball even slightly moving? They will just, somehow Jesus would be brought up and somehow, uh, just something them versus us, Republican, Democrat, liberal, conservative and nothing would get done and they would just sit there screaming at each other maybe. Or maybe they could figure out a way to actually use whatever the fuck pollution is, like whatever the carbon goes into the atmosphere, pull that out and convert that into energy. It seems like there's probably some fucking nerds that already know how to do something along those lines. Maybe not to that level, but at least take the shit from down the dump. You know, they know how to do it. There's just no money in it and it's just like they probably get checks to not get things done.

Speaker 2:          00:05:23       Please show up with hookers and fucking just a fucking big freight train full of money. Kalon boys. It's a party so that then we got to get all new machines that's going to cost us a bunch of money. Just do it the way we do it until we die and then you guys can do it how you want to do it. By then someone else has bought into the deal. So I am completely pessimistic when it comes to that shit. People think that that's all bullshit that like those kinds of conspiracies don't exist. Come on, you guys are just nuts. This is stupid. Nobody would do that. If they get rid of pollution, they would. But if getting rid of the pollution costs somebody money, I guarantee you there'd be somebody that tried to cock

Speaker 3:          00:05:58       pocket. Yeah, there would be. If there was a guy like the, the classic William Randolph Hearst story, I don't know this, but the reason why marijuana became illegal wasn't because there was a problem with people smoking marijuana. It was because William Randolph Hearst owned paper mills and he also own newspapers and so he was going to have to convert his paper mills over the hemp paper because it's way easier to grow. You refill an entire forest in like a year, like you chop them down. They brought her, oh yeah. I mean he owned a lot of newspapers and he was the reason why Rosebud was, you know, that whole, that whole citizen Kane movie, the coast, he's fucking, he was fucking crazy. But he had so much money and so much power that he could just print fake stories. So he wrote these stories about blacks and Mexicans and I'm sure he didn't write them, but he commissioned them blacks and Michigan smoking this new drug called marijuana and having sex with all these white women.

Speaker 3:          00:06:51       Like that wasn't even what they called marijuana. If he actually did that. I want to have people died because of that story. Oh God. A lot. I'm sure a lot people in jail. I mean, just think about that. That was in the 1930s and it's still stuck. It was all about hemp. It wasn't even about marijuana. They weren't even worried about the drug. The drug was commonly used amongst jazz singers and all these other people. It's smoked pot. It was a normal thing. The real issue was the hemp, like the commodity, the non psychoactive hemp. They were worried about it taking over and having to spend millions of dollars to convert all his paper plants to hemp paper.

Speaker 2:          00:07:27       Yeah. You just want to smoke weed against the good spirits. People who don't believe in conspiracy is fighting to be. It's like, dude, you can inspire. You go to a bar, you see two hot chicks. She come up with a game plan. It's a conspiracy. You conspiring to get over there and try and fuck them. Then just to sit there and like, like all advertising there. You're a cunt. What the fuck I'm doing here now? Selling my special. You don't conspire. Yeah. You think I just showed up here? Yeah. We conspired talks. Your children's got a Zillion fucking followers. He's a fan of my shit. I know it's gonna come off. Good. This'll get me more like, yeah, I want, I want this to keep going. Just not randomly doing this shit. You're conspiring. Yeah. But just because I'm not whacking a president in the middle of it doesn't mean it's not a conspiracy. Well, the shed like the end

Speaker 3:          00:08:15       Ron's disaster that went down, that was a conspiracy. There's a bunch of conspiracies that you could see in clear form

Speaker 2:          00:08:22       that actually did happen. Well, the best thing they did is they make conspiracy synonymous with more ronic thought. And everybody says, Oh, you putting your 10 ad on. It's like this whole country came about through a conspiracy. The Revolution was not a spontaneous act. People sat there and was like, okay, we're going to rebel against these fuckers. Well, they're gonna hang us as traders if we don't pull this off. They came up with a game plan, if you want to call it that. But if, if they lost, they would, they would had been talking about this treasonous conspiracy by all these guys that are now on our money site. Right up. So true. That's so true. Yeah. But now, but then if you say you're into any sort of conspiracy, that automatically means you think nine 11 was an inside job and that the moon was made out of cheese.

Speaker 2:          00:09:05       Well nine 11 is the best one because this is the one that I was using. My favorite one. When people don't believe in conspiracies, I just say, do you believe that nine 11 happened? And they say yes. Well then you believe in conspiracies cause people conspired to fucking hijack planes and fly them in a buildings that doesn't just by my whole thing was that, that you know that Americans were involved. And then that image, give me a fucking break. Okay, right on it. Right out the gate. You gotta be like, okay, so who wants to fly it in and die there? God likes to do, I mean you got to have an absolute fucking nutjob do something like that. So do you got to have them? I mean, I don't think we've ever even, we've never had kamikaze is you now have been able to get Americans to be like, listen, I'll go over there and try and fuck some people up, but if you think I'm going to fly some shit into something or walk into a cafe, strapped up with a bomb the fuck outta here, no Americans to Dadada, we've had guys jump on grenades to save other people to run into pizza hut.

Speaker 2:          00:10:06       And that's not our style. That's not, that's not our style. We're not in a suicide bombing. Yeah, we're in to doing it from 60,000 feet, calling it freedom with an x box. No. The funny thing about the original suicide bombers, the, uh, the kamikaze says there were all mapped out. I didn't realize that until a few years ago. I didn't even know that math was like an important part of their diet back then. I never saw that in the Ken Burns documentary. It's apparently of just a historical fact. And even there was a recent report on Hitler. Hitler himself was on, uh, a litany of medication and one of them was meth. They were giving a meth. They would give meth to people, but I can't fault him for that dude. The amount of energy that that guy put out during his speeches, he needed something to level off.

Speaker 2:          00:10:53       Forget about, forget about the screaming and yelling. Just sitting that still waiting for the right moment. Building them into that. That frenzy. Do you ever watch that Michael Jackson documentary right before he died, when he drove, just freeze after he did a dance move. Let it simmer. Let it simmer. That's Hitler Shit. Just sitting in that fucking chair. Just getting him crazy. Just wanting to hear or see the next thing. What's he gonna do? It's timing. It's fucking timing. Some people do that on stage. The Michael Jackson Hitler simmer moment. You would have to, we got to do that tonight at the comedy store. All right, we good? Okay. We've got to have this. You got him. Oh Dude. If we had some of the technology, I could be in your ear telling me keep [inaudible]. You had to keep a straight face after a punchline. As you're looking down some fucked up hose and I'm just going to let it simmer, let it simmer, let it simmer and release. So my dad was great. Comedy clubs are filled with drugs and it's nothing.

Speaker 1:          00:11:53       You know the thing about a guy like Michael Jackson, he's up there doing some shit you can't do, he spinning and moon walking and it's an acrobatic event. But you see a guy like you are a guy like me on stage talking and you're like, I can fucking talk. You know we all have to get a couple of drinks. Just kind of went out like we're going to do roll call. Yeah, you have a couple of drinks. I can fucking talk. I know how to talk. I can't moonwalk. I could fuck a talk. So you can't hold those, those pauses to them. It's like the green light fucking queer that can help. Right? They can't help it. Those big juicy pauses. It's just this opening. They could, they could say something funny too, like when it happens in a movie theater, most of the time it's retarded.

Speaker 1:          00:12:36       But every now and then someone will yell something out in a movie theater and it's fucking hilarious. Right. And then that guy, you know, he becomes a hero for that crowd. He just killed. There's always that one guy doing the sporting event. So like now we'd like to take a moment of silence for all the victims. Yeah, the fucking outhouse fire and everybody shuts up and it's like, just, we just want you to remain quiet for 30 seconds. It's always that guy. 20 seconds. They just hear this guy go like, let's wrap it up. I want to see what I came in to pay for. Why do those fucking moments of silence? Like she know you could do like a 10 count at a boxing match if a, you know, Lou Dibella dies or something like that. Or one of those guys. What was his name?

Speaker 1:          00:13:18       Lou was the, the the famous guy that had like the worst skin. No, no, no. There's this famous, it's funny. So I'm video flu, Goddammit Wallach. I don't remember the name I'll send her was as new. It's famous all throughout the grant. 1980s Easton's he used to train Meldrick Taylor. I don't remember. Anyway, the point is he looked like the most unhealthy guy ever. Who Do Va. That's it. Luke Duba. You nailed it. Pull up a picture of Lou do. But just so everybody knows what the fuck we're talking about. But he was, you know when he died, I'm sure they had a a 10 count for a guy like that. A 10 count. Okay. But those fucking 30 seconds of silence. Come on man. He had to pay for that wonderful head of hair, man. You have to see what this dude, it looks like. I don't remember what he page not found. That's what they looked like. He looked like an older Freddie Blassie classy. Freddie Blassie. Nobody. There he is. Lil Duval. Come on. Come on. Seriously. That might be the most unhealthy looking man that's ever lived. Yeah, but that's right towards the end, Matt, even 12 he had that Elvis here. He did have some good hair. Did Fonzie here phrase whole fucking life. I'm so jealous.

Speaker 1:          00:14:31       Anyway, point being those moments that you do in like that kind of a performance. And plus if Michael Jackson's doing it this fucking 30,000 people there and you know, at least 68 huge numbers. Yeah. What was like the biggest place he's ever done? It was probably like hundreds of thousands. The original family that owned the New England

Speaker 2:          00:14:52       patriots, they went bankrupt on the Michael Jackson victory tour when he went out with a, with all of his brothers, uh, the sun put the thing together, and I don't know if this is true, so I got to preface this, but a promoter in Boston told me this cold forever. Like Michael Jackson was going to go to Foxboro stadium with a patriots were playing and they promoted the show and all the tickets and he had that would of pay or play, whatever they call, no matter what, you got to pay the guy. And the town of Foxborough said, no, we don't want to show, we don't want all these black people coming out here. All right. That's what it was. That's what it was. I mean the white people got too crazy on Monday night and they stopped having Monday night football for like 20 years. Like FoxPro was like, then we're not having this really, this is a quiet little town, have you football game during the day on Sunday and then get the fuck out of here.

Speaker 2:          00:15:38       So they canceled the show and I thought the, the amount of money lost on that show, they were close enough that that brought him under. But what this promoted was claiming was this guy actually promoted the whole tour. And when he was doing the finances, he didn't take into consideration how big Michael Jackson stage was and how many seats that that was going to eat up. He had this giant ass fucking stage that was eating up like tens of thousands of dollars a night times all of these fucking dates. And when he tried to get him go, Hey Mike, can you just have a smaller stage, blah blah. I guess he was competing with Prince and was saying like now cause if I have a smallest stage, prince will have a bigger stage and I got to make sure my shit is bigger than his. Of course you said that in a falsetto, I don't know if this is true.

Speaker 2:          00:16:20       Right. But like this is the story of this guy told me, it blew my mind. I was like Oh I always thought they went broke on just on one fucking date that he canceled that and I just figured you know there's 60,000 people there. That's what reminded me talking about 60,000 people all paid that money and he still had to give him a cut of that and they just didn't have it. That actually does make sense that the the size of the stage thing. That totally makes sense. Yeah. Cause there's a comedy club that did that in New York where they, for some reason they moved the stage out away from the wall and now this little small club and they moved it away from the wall so the waitresses could walk behind the stage behind this wall. And like they took out like five or six tables and all the other comedy clubs were laughing and they figured out how much money they fucked themselves out of over the course of a year.

Speaker 2:          00:17:02       You know, doing shows two or three shows a night times six, seven days. Like they were fucking themselves out of like three quarters of a million dollars a year. So they hadn't, they, they ended up having to move the wall. Those fucking hilarious, everybody from day one is just like, this is stupid. It was already one of those rooms that was kind of shape. It's not to celebrate was shaped like the seller where it's like you're standing sideways in a rectangle. So you kinda got to angle yourself and they took that shit and moved you further into the crowd. So it was almost like a year in the round almost. Yeah, but only on, but the people who are at two sides, this is a place like that in San Francisco. There's a theater that I did. It's like that. It's weird. You walk the stage goes out into the crowd and like, so people are behind you.

Speaker 2:          00:17:41       And to the left and behind you and to the right. It's very strange. You did that thing with me, right? Yeah. Yeah. That was weird. Right. I know that you have, I want to be sitting behind a performance. No, well I'm doing a theater in the round in, in Phoenix. Just collaborative theater. Yeah. Just cause it would be weird now that I do it five times before you do, Oh, you've done this before. I just start the joke on this side and then turn an end on that side and I just really try to be conscious of sections. Like Dane said, the most brilliant thing about the, uh, the, the theater in the round, he goes, it's for theaters. Just look at it that way. It's four theaters just all stuck together and you just sorta performing one theater. Then this one and then that went over there and then I just think you do it like the, the, the three card Monte, he just sort of switch it up like you don't, right, right, right.

Speaker 2:          00:18:28       As you go around. But I know, I know people that have seen comics I'll do is theater in the round. They'll be like, so and so was here and he didn't move it. Not One of those comics, it's just standing with the mic and the mic stand. So they were in the back and just sitting there and one of them had like a slow turning stage. So eventually you just send that dude 20 more jokes. He's going to be looking at us. So he made the stage turn while they have a stage that turns. And I think that's for musical acts. We have a drama drunk kid in amps planted, so they're not moving, but it's also for, I think like performance who just want to stand there and not move around. It's fun around like they're wrote a fucking carousel. You did that one very slowly.

Speaker 2:          00:19:08       Very slowly. It spins around the one that turns though. Yeah. But it turns very slowly. Very slowly. It's the same place. Yeah. The celebrity theater. That's the one we're talking about. Yeah. I forgot that it turns. Yeah, they asked me the option, do you want the stage turned on? Um, I'm definitely gonna say yes. Oh, I always say no. It's like I don't need, I don't need that. I want to just for, cause it's weird. Yeah. Well if they can speed it up, you could literally just be running in place doing a whole fucking choke running against it. My goal is to do so many shots while months, days that I can't figure out where the stool is at any given time. It can be anywhere. It's moving around. No. Well I was going to say, no way. I've been drunk twice on stage. It was twice, twice and 20 something years.

Speaker 2:          00:19:50       Yeah. It's not the best move every now and then though. It's the right thing to do once I was in Ireland. So that's not my fault. And the other time I was coming back from a Yankees Red Sox game and didn't know it was going to have a show and somebody called up, hey, I had a falling out, can you come down and do the show? And I thought it was sober. One of those like, yeah, Hey, I'll do it. And I just went up there and I was just like, she's, yeah, should I heard? And I was just like, oh shit. I had to slow way down and had a very, very uh, subpar fucking shows bad. So you had a slow way down just to get your mouth to work right? Yes. Which killed the timing of everything. So I, I bombed very slowly. I see that with um, that the term punch drunk. That's like a term that people don't like. But that's a, that's exactly what it's like. That same thing where you know you're a little fucked up so you have to struggle to get your words out. But you could see that in fighters it's exact same thing. It's why they call it punch drunk. It's not just, they sound like they're drunk, but the same thing like you have to struggle

Speaker 1:          00:20:48       to control your situation and then when those guys get drunk, that's when you see guys that are really punched drunk guys that had been punched drunk get drunk. Cause then you see they have a hard side because they have a really hard time controlling the words then that it's just a, it's a mangled mess. It's hard to understand the, that

Speaker 2:          00:21:07       that UFC, the a, what do you call when they stick them in the house and all that shit. Ultimate fighter, the ultimate fighter and it's all women. And like I remember last time I did your podcast, I was against it like women in the octagon. It's like they, they like why would you do that? They're beautiful. Why would you punch each other in the face? And I want to see a jab. Do you have breasts and shed? It's just, I didn't want to see it and now I don't even notice it anymore. And it's, it's unbelievably fucking entertaining. You don't notice that the girls anymore. Now I know they're great fights and it's guys who are already good at talking shit and fucking not liking each other, but they're just women. Just take it to that extra fucking level, that shit talking. And then the fact that they can beat the fuck out of you.

Speaker 2:          00:21:48       And then it's funny there's a guy to be just watching it going like there is not one woman in this house that I could even get on the floor. Like these women would all just mop the floor with me. There's a fucking hilarious youtube video. Somebody tweeted it to me and I don't, I don't know, I just lost it in the ether. It was this girl, it just starts writing in. It was almost one of those six second videos, whatever the fucking kids call him. And you knew this kid had a little bit of training and this girl had more training and she came at him and it was like she climbed up his body, like stepped on his fucking thigh and then was behind them. And the video ends with him just grabbing like, this is its rear naked girl. You know, he was out before he went and the whole Party just goes, oh, and it ends and I fucking died laughing.

Speaker 2:          00:22:28       But going like I wouldn't even have lasted as long is that kid did. Cause it seemed like he knew a little bit of a defense. A little bit of defense like I have a great Rhonda Rousey. Bit of like what it would be like to date her if she was actually physically abusive, but I just can't do the prat fall. I want to act like you know her big movies. She does that fucking throw and you go over a hip and just you fucking landed on the ground. You're like in a relationship with her. Oh our bar real mature. Showing you like I know I tapped out. That doesn't mean because you're right. I didn't want my heart broken and then she comes out. You got to knock down the stool to try to have something in between you and her.

Speaker 1:          00:23:06       I think it took like that probably has to date of fighter. If I had to guess. She probably has to date some guy who also knows how to do what she does. I just couldn't imagine

Speaker 2:          00:23:16       Jen a fight data. I'd be on the kitchen like an apron just like make her an her food and shit. I just couldn't get me. Look at me sideways. You'd fuck me up.

Speaker 1:          00:23:24       Almost every female fighter does. They all date fighters. They just does. Just seems like, you know a girl being in a position like that where she could just beat the fuck out of her boyfriend. I don't think chicks like that.

Speaker 2:          00:23:35       That's, I never looked at it that way cause I always thought it was hilarious. Like I, I, I could date somebody like that. I would think it was funny that they can kick the shit and one of my guy friends gave me shit. I'd be like, yeah man, she kicked shit out of me. And you, I think it's funny but like I never looked at it like, cause even though they are like, like these lethal weapons now there is still there could possibly still I should say, I don't want to speak for him that this female male relationship where that they still want the guy to be able to protect them and it's just kind of like uh yeah dude that's funny. Cause then they're just sort of rendering you useless cause they're already making a zillion dollars. So there goes your on providing I can protect you and do what I can kick your ass.

Speaker 2:          00:24:13       And then I can also have a kid. So you're basically now like a 45 year old teenager, which just gives you a little height chair. You know what I like about watching it? Like self sustained unit? I think it's fucking awesome. What I like about watching female fights is the, they're more reliant on technique because they don't have overwhelming physical strength, but there are certain guys that have overwhelming physical strength and abilities you can plow through. Yeah. They could just defects in that game. Yeah, they can muscle things. They can, they just hit really hard. So sometimes they have like shitty technique. They throw windmill punches, but with a lot of women, what you're getting is you're getting the purest technique. You can, again, it depends on where you're head is a gentleman with my opponent given plenty of time to see it coming and let them know the couches are always coming from the same direction.

Speaker 2:          00:25:06       If he see the left, the next one's the right. Have you see the right? The next one? Yeah. Don't get tricky. What's fucking dumb? You're less linear story. This isn't Tarantino. We're dancing here. Okay. Left right, left, right. But with checks, they're, they're forced to use more tech mean the obviously there's, there's a curve as far as like physical strength is like someone like Serena Williams. So obviously a very physically strong girl and there's other girls that are like not as physically strong, you know, throw me over a couch and you know, when you hit the window like sideways and then slide that she's so land on some gym shoes pressive like her legs and the strength that she has, I was at, I was at a party one time, uh, some agency I used to be at and they also represented her and you forget your agency also represents, you know, athletes cause they want to like fucking, you know, make money off of selling to readers or whatever.

Speaker 2:          00:25:55       Right. And she was at the party with a basketball player, so he was like, you know, so they were probably a portion couple, like I felt like a dwarf dude. Like she was like, uh, just like, it was totally gorgeous. Totally in proportion, just like, like super athlete. Do Marvel Comic, uh, bodies that's like on like, dude, you should be wearing a fucking cape. It just, no, and it's just, you know, you just see people like that and you just go like, oh yeah, that's why like you always sit there in the back of your head as you watching some quarterback. That sucks. What if I did some more setups? What if I get thrown against my body like fucking Brett far, but not throw an interception. And then you actually run into the real athletes do. When I saw Joe Theismann who always looked like a little fella, you know, when he was out there, he had the one little bar here, he got his leg broken.

Speaker 2:          00:26:42       He just, he always looked just so small. When he was out there, I saw the guy and like in a mall, he's like six one in like still jacked. I'm like almost five, 10. I'm just going like, this guy would fucking drop me. How did he, uh, did he get his leg fixed to, they put bars in it and pins and shit. Like how did he get his legs fixed? I imagine I haven't been in contact with the, did anybody at the hospital, did that end his career? That was my, my question. Yes it did. That was the last play he watched. He said, I'm on what time you said he watched the replay one time. Uh, and that was, that was it for him and uh, and I actually win a silver, broke his leg. I think that reminded me of that, that compound fracture of just like, oh my God.

Speaker 2:          00:27:23       Oh my God, I can't even imagine the pain. And then going into the shock. And then the fact now is he's coming back, right Silva's. Yeah. January is to fucking sit there after you went through that and to just the first time you start throwing kicks with that leg again. Just like the level of whatever that is. I don't have that anywhere in my life. Like if I ever fucking broke my leg like that doing stand up, that's it. I would, I would be, I'd open a comedy club used to go up on stage. I know I don't, I don't want to do that anymore.

Speaker 1:          00:27:55       He's at the end of his career. He's got a few years left fighting and uh, he has an opportunity to still make a lot of money and I think he's probably just going to make as much money as you can over the next few years and then get out. Now what, what is the, that that rumor that I hear that if you break a bone, this is such a bother heal stronger and heal stronger to sort of, I mean it's less likely to break in the area where it broke. It's less likely to break there. It gets knotted up and thick, but not necessarily sure it gets stronger. Thank you doctor Brogan and say, why am I asking you these fucking questions? Do know a lot about broken bones. This is how I learned all of my shit. Asking people who don't have the job, asking ups, get all those packages to everybody overnight. If you ever have questions like that and you want answers, ask Brian Cowen and even if he doesn't know the answer, he'll fucking keep going. He will come up with something that's a logical just insecurity of just not knowing the answer. He just has to fucking answer. He'll fuck it. Argue about some shit. He's not educated at all I love, but he also has a shitload of fucking information is had. Brian is like one of the best I've ever right.

Speaker 2:          00:29:06       Met At being able to pull quotes out of the air about books that he's read like constantly. He's writing book hang with him from one, three minutes. You realize he's out of his fucking mind. He's crazy. He just gets the best everything. I love him. I love him, but he's out. He's out of his fucking mind. There's definitely crazy. He's fucking mind is going like a thousand rpms constantly. Whenever I talked to him. You just got to do the alley. You lay against the ropes and just let all the information come at you and then you get them with one and then you come back. Oh, and by the way we can do it. He got a pair of shoulders on you. How would he to do at that point? Is that what is hanging off of, you know, I bet you got to be sign. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:29:42       Yeah. And a piece on Ya. I went hunting with him. It was five. I mean I've done it three times now. It's five days of gay jokes. Fish by not shutting up. You really should be here. People are gonna think I don't like him. I love him. I love him. I just like trashing him. He knows what he does. That's part of his charm is that he likes to make fun of himself. Did he go out and talk to the bear and ask him what he's doing to get those back muscles? He would almost as big as mine. I got mad. I got to find out. But we were for five days. If I walked around on all fours and occasionally stood up, I like a beer. I'd be like a bear without all that hair.

Speaker 1:          00:30:24       Five days, every time. It's just constantly the Brian Count show cause you could just wind them up. He's just that guy. He's always on. He's never not funny. Like he's never, I never called Bryon. He's depressed, you know. If he is depressed and be depressed for a couple of minutes and then it'll just start talking about something and it'll tell you start talking about lean muscle mass or how he's built for dance and he'll just go into something and then next thing you know you're laughing. He just doesn't want that uncomfortable silence. No. He's like, what's his face at the end of the hulk? Feel big speed instead of walking away from the town. Those were his troubles. Do you know that the hulk, they changed. I just want to keep trashing him until people show them this clip. Two I get on his show again. They changed the hoax name by the way, the piece of salt now that's from uh, the, the hippie warehouse.

Speaker 1:          00:31:17       These ideas, the salt crystal lamps, they're supposed to and somehow or another like generate positive ions and Salsify, the air float through the air and make you feel better. They changed. Robert Banner was a bill Bixby characters name on the hulk, but the real, the real name is Bruce Banner. Right. But they changed it from Bruce to Robert for TV because they thought Bruce is a gaining Bruce. How did it bro? You angry again? I'll get mad. Right? God Green last night it was don thing and you ruined your pants again. Bruce become a gaming. It's like Bruce for the long. For the longest time it was like, you know Bruce, I was going to say Bruce Jenner, but I guess that's a bad example now. It was a good example a few years back to that guy. What's going on? He's such a good looking guy. Yeah, no, it was never anything wrong with his nose.

Speaker 1:          00:32:10       He's becoming a good looking older lady though. That's what's going on. Hey, God bless them. If it makes him happy, God bless him. If it makes him happy, I just, I just don't. Just watching people fucking age badly. Oh, attack in their face. Yeah. It's a weird thing that people do. They get, they want to change it and then they think when they changed that it looks better. It just looks different for the most part. How much of a hug do you need if you're staring at your throat in the mirror, like sideways holding America. And I don't like my Adam's apple, like I don't think I've, I don't know what my Adam's apple look, I couldn't pick up my Adam's apple and a fucking lineup. I don't think I've ever looked at it. I think his deal, and I'm just guessing is that he's probably transitioning to being a woman.

Speaker 1:          00:32:52       If I had to guess. I think, I think that's a probably a pretty safe estimate at this point. He's grown his hair long. His nails are long. He had is now, do you think he'll come back [inaudible] name or do you think he'll just got fingernail Polish on now? Man. Do you think he'll, he'll uh, he'll, he'll go with a, um, a new name, like three Cema. Yes. I'm saying, do you think he'll go hacky and just make his name of feminine like Bill, Bill Arena? Like Betty has a fucking full character that he, that he becomes when it becomes, let me see, let me put, bring it back up. Bring it back up. Those nails. I mean, first of all, if this is fake, he looks like a Jennifer. You think so? I would say Claudia. Nah, he's not a Claudia. I was going to say he looks like a Claudia.

Speaker 1:          00:33:44       Look at him. He's got a cigarette. Susan or a Jennifer. So he's smoking cigarettes to look at him right here. Yeah. We all know gay people. They're always smoking cigarettes. That's what is happening. I think that looks like that's a pretty good picture of what he probably looks like. He has like his lipstick on when no one's looking and he's tucking. That's bad. He looks like he looks like an older lead singer of a band and they're doing the casino circuit. The earrings too. It's like he really, he seems to be coming. A woman seems to be becoming one good for him. Yeah. I mean this is a good time to be a lady is a good time to be a transgender woman to, you know, people are more accepting of it than ever before. It's a good time for me, but it's, I mean it should, but it should bother you.

Speaker 1:          00:34:37       It should not really. Should not. It should not. You know, having said that, I hate the color of his nail Polish. The red is my favorite. I feel like if you're going to fail, he's that he's that type that's too racy for, I don't mind it. He's an Olympic medalist. What do you think you should have black go golf. I think he needs an edge. I think he's just a little too soft. Like God's got his hair blown out. I wouldn't, if I had to do a makeover, less scarves, less flowing shit. And I, yeah, he needs an edge man. Poor God. Look at him. He's wearing those visors, this old lady tennis visors. If you're not a hunter s Thompson and they don't say that Vegas on them. Take that fucking thing off. That was the picture of absolute bliss though. I think he wants to do it. That's what he wants to do. Well listen, he's been with those crazy bitches for so long. He became one. I mean, that's really what it is. I think it's a little more, I think they tricked him. Joe. I think they could put you in that

Speaker 2:          00:35:38       house. And I don't think you're coming out looking like that. I probably would imagine if, I did imagine if it was proven that if you're around women like that many women long enough, they slowly but surely Ab your masculinity away. Do you want to become a woman?

Speaker 4:          00:35:52       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:35:53       If it's proven that like we, we imitate our atmosphere so much that one more around the opposite sex for two months or one of those people that view a, what's that psychological word? They say that you're a, a, you're codependent and you know, you got to watch out who you hang out with. They're pretty soon you're doing what they're doing and next thing you know, you know there are people like you want a pleated skirt, you'd like some uggs probably starts with the eggs. I think it starts to feet it the feet first head of curious and then you, your work your way up your body if you're easing into it. Yeah, because people aren't going to notice that time. One time I got a manicure, I fucking hated it. Did you get angry? No, I just, I didn't like it. Pain. I didn't. Why didn't you like it? Well, I was on, I was on the road with the, uh, Charlie Murphy and Don l and it's acceptable in the, uh, amongst black guys to get your fucking nails done. Right. It's like considered some pimp shit. So like you got to do it. So I've literally sitting there,

Speaker 4:          00:36:56       okay,

Speaker 2:          00:36:56       next Charlie like this with my hand in the thing and I'm lab bill Byrd is the way to do it. No, he was laughing too because I just kept saying, this is the most feminist fucking thing I've ever done. Forget about doing it with you who's just overloaded with testosterone. Say, Charlie, you need to do this so you don't win. Mill kicked somebody. I don't know. I'm more in the middle. I don't need to do this. And I was on stage that night and I was just going like this. I was self conscious. I got the, I got the clear, I got the clear fetish and they were just like, glistening. Yeah. But then what sucks is then it starts to peel. So then he just, he had just fucking scratch and then it looks gross. Did you try to prematurely age it? Do you like maybe get some sandpaper and rubber?

Speaker 2:          00:37:36       I was doing all, I was super homophobic about it. Fingers in the dirt. Like fisting the dirt. Yeah. Trying to get the nail Polish off now I found somebody with one of those gravel driveways isn't a fun thing in the African American community getting your toes and nails done. Like this picture's a dude's like getting their toes done on the cell phone. No talking with this Alpha now I remember that. Yeah. No it wasn't really his, it was his friend's company. But yeah, he was a part of it. Yeah. No they, they, they take being cleaned to a whole nother level and is generally speaking, some of 'em think white people are pretty filthy. That was a trend in MMA fighters for the longest time was getting their nails done. Like chocolate. Dell started out [inaudible] is funny, man colored pink and I thought it was to me, that's fucking funny cause you can kick the shit out of somebody. That's that. Yeah. Way that Bruce Lee story. What's stuff that he used to walk around wherever the fuck he was from even go into the city and he would act all the feminine so people would fuck with them and then he'd beat the shit

Speaker 1:          00:38:36       out of him and his friend would say, why did you do that? And he said, because if I just kicked his ass, he could get over it. But if some of feminine guy kicked his ass, that's going to stay with them. And I want that to be true. I can give you the, the whatever the book is. The Bruce Lee book is a, it has a red cover. I can never remember the name of it and a black and white photo and he's like this and just fucking shredded. Yeah, he was across to all the other Bruce Lee photos where he's like 20 pounds overweight. Sorry. I would think that he would probably be a guy who would come up with a bunch of different real life scenarios just to test as martial arts and to, to, you know, becoming a feminine guy and have guys try to beat your ass.

Speaker 1:          00:39:12       It seems like a good move. It's pretty bad ass. I think it's a smart move because most people spend their lives right here. Avoiding physical confrontations. It's like, you know, you know once, once people really started gaining weight and fucking bloody noses and broke, busted eye sockets, I tapped out. I was just like, I'm going to tell some jokes. If you, the only way to really test it is to test in a real life situation. There's a lot of people that look really good in the gym and then when it comes to an actual fight, they just fall apart and panic. They just can't do it. I just think that you need that. You got to have a couple of days that's like, you know, for some drinks, no, you gotta, you gotta have a couple of fights and hopefully survive them. Yeah. If you don't have a fight, and if you ever, you ever seen someone get in a fight that's never been in a fight before and go into a full panic?

Speaker 1:          00:39:56       No. I think I've told this story before, but it was at the comedy store. We're sitting on the patio and there was this guy, this black guy in a white guy, they were fighting in front of the House of Blues and the yelling at each other and it turns physical and as it turns physical, the white guy is in full on fucking panic mode. His eyes are closed and he's literally, was this me flailing this way? Like this way, like not moving his shoulders, but his arms are like, like he's boxing the guy's ears. That's what he's doing right. Left, right, left. I mean his hands are open. He's just absolutely in a full panic. And then a bus pulls in front of them and then I don't get to see what the fuck happened. The bus moves past, the guys laid out flat out called the black guy's nowhere to be found.

Speaker 1:          00:40:42       The white guys fucking dead, stiff, knocked out. People are freaking out. So obviously he got hit. I have no idea what happened. Is this bad? That's a bad, that's not your face, right? Terrible technique. It doesn't hurt your opponent. Double Time. It's the good thing about it is you being very ethical, like you're not, you know, harming your opponent. You're involved in a physical altercation but you're not going to do any damage. Just want to say is you don't wanna hurt your hands punching somebody skull or you don't want to fuck up your manicure. Snoop Dogg Snoop Dogg has his nails did. Wow. He's gets French tips I guess. Different colors. White, black, white, black. Yeah. Okay. He's snoop Dogg. He can do it. Remember when Tate used to do his nails? Tate used to have colored nails. That whole Alpha Nail Polish thing. Those, there's a lot of dummies that we're doing that for awhile they all got off of it. Roger worked had, yeah. That's

Speaker 2:          00:41:34       the type of shit that like when you almost start dressing like a chick, like you actually get more pussy. Like more women come out. Like that rock star thing, that Androgynous fucking look. You stop borrowing that close and next thing you know that blowing you. That's how I heard it went down. What's really funny is that and hit parade is pre like Reddit, like Judas priest started a lot of the metal stuff. Rob Halford, you know all the SLM dressing s and m dressing and people didn't realize he was gay as fuck. Right? Yeah. I had no idea rob Hoffman was gay as fuck and he got all of these guys to essentially dress like gay s and m guys. Yeah. Like that was what became the luck is brilliant, but that's so much of a bad motherfucker. He is. He made people kind of one of the great front man and then nothing too he, he basically was completely 100% other than Freddie Mercury, who was literally in a band called Queen and we're just so dumb.

Speaker 2:          00:42:28       Like, no, he's fine. He's straight. He sings good. That's all. Don't be homophobic like it matters. Yeah. I have to ta do funny. Mark, you and me, that fucking guy that live aid set is one of the, I would put that up against anybody's performance ever. Oh, he was a bad mother fucker, dude. He turned Wembley Stadium into a fucking coffee house. He had them. Everybody like the fucking back row that had, that guy was unbelievable. He was sensational. He was a really unique talent. Like, like there was no one like him before because he was such a combination of like masculinity and femininity and exp. I never noticed any of that. I was just like, this fucking guy. You can't stop watching him and his, his, his, his, uh, his singing was incredible and he was better live as good as the albums worries. One of the few guys that was actually fucking better live.

Speaker 2:          00:43:25       I haven't seen anybody come close to that guy. Wow. Since, wow, that's a strong, anybody you got anybody that could fuck fucking hold 100,000 people in the palm of his hand after he had to follow all those other beasts. You know, it's true. You had to go and have to Robert Plant Jimmy page. I went, didn't go well that was the one that was one of the ones that didn't go out, which is why 2007 went so well because they were like, we can't do that again. They put it together the last fucking second. And then you had like say they had, did they had to dramas at the sink. Can you please whisper that in my ear during my act and are you were, you were the first guy to call me up. You called me up and left a message about Zeplin you called me.

Speaker 2:          00:44:06       I'd be like, you're not going to fucking believe this, but you got to go devastating. Go on Youtube. You're not going to fucking believe this. They stole everything. They fucking stole away that I was saying that they fucking, this this thing they called the song remains the same. And they was showing how many dude there right now going, going to trial. Yup. On Stairway to heaven. And you call me about this. It was many years of dating to me. I still love John Bottom. I actually still loved that music because I still have all cause it is still great and I still, and I, all those childhood memories of where I was when I, when I was going on, but like I, you know, it's like the Cosby thing. He just hope it isn't true.

Speaker 3:          00:44:38       Well, the Zeppelin thing to me,

Speaker 2:          00:44:40       yeah. With a riff raping women. That latest one with the [inaudible]

Speaker 3:          00:44:47       worse. Yeah. The, the, the Cosby thing is very different obviously. But the thing about Zeppelin that got me was that every band is influenced by every other band, every band. I mean they all, you're, you're going back to everybody who your fans with. And this guys, it's sound like guys because that was their music. And I think as a lot of us has calming influence be influenced. No one ever got sued for as my point though is my point. My point was, but there's a certain line that you cross that they crossed where they were stealing rifts. The opening to stairway to heaven. It's like my God, it's a silage. They'll allege it seems like the same thing, legit allegedly allegedly delivery. But it made me less, it made me like them less. I know the music is still amazing, but it made me like the less that was a, that was devastating.

Speaker 2:          00:45:39       Yeah. But they're still, but I have a bootleg of this and they have them at like, um, the whiskey or something. And they have a song called killing floor that sounds like the lemon song. And then by the time it's out on led Zeppelin to, it's called lemon song. And then later they got sued for that by the guy who wrote killing floor. So they, it's not like they didn't know. That's one of those things where it's just like, dude, you obviously knew that you would call an a killing floor is a cover and then you switched some of the lyrics and then called it the lemon song. That's fun. But I don't know if this is, to me, this is just me, is completely uneducated looking at this shit. I just know that, uh, you know, that just is a little suspect. But just, you know, obviously I'm not a musician, so I mean, I don't know. Fucking, I dunno. I don't want it to be true.

Speaker 3:          00:46:24       I don't want it to be true either. But that's the same thing as the Cosby stuff. Nobody wants, I mean, those, I was reading this Chris Rock articles really interesting Chris rock article where he's talking about, um, people being offended by everything. And that's why he doesn't do colleges anymore cause it just looking to be offended at things and they're just too easy to offend. But you know, he was saying that he just doesn't want it to be true. And I think everybody feels like that except the people that obviously were raped by him.

Speaker 2:          00:46:47       Well, they would want it not to be true because then they wouldn't be raped. Right. So, yeah. So like all of like, yeah, you don't want that to happen to somebody. And then also this person that you, you hold as a comedian, you know, we almost went to see him too. We were going to, we're planning on taking a trip to Vegas. I saw him earlier this year. Did you? Yup. We're just seeing him. I saw him out in Pasadena at a theater and I met him, uh, about a year and a half ago. It was fucking amazing. Really. It was amazing. It was fucking amazing. I was, uh, his set was amazing. Yeah. At everything. Yeah. Yeah. When he went to go see the guy, me talking about guy, you know, 77 years, 76, 77 years old, was excited about his new special and was like, why am I tell you I shot this Dang.

Speaker 2:          00:47:28       And then she was animated, so fucking excited about his new special and was just like to see a guy that far into it still that excited about standup. Like, dude, like that gave me a charge for like weeks and uh, you know, so like I said, I hope it's not true. Yeah. I really hope it's not true for the victims more so than it, but you're just focusing on him though. But if you're doing that, then the victims are crazy lunches, alleged victim. Well, I mean, and then you know, that's better to be a crazy person to be a crazy liar than to be a rape victim. They were to being raped by bill Cosby.

Speaker 5:          00:48:00       This new one is interesting because the girl said it says she was 15 and he, he took her to the playboy mansion and allegedly, but when you go to the playboy mansion, they have your name on records. Like every person that goes there has to put their name down in all their information down. It's, there might be actual proof that she was 15 and he took her to the playboy mansion

Speaker 2:          00:48:21       sound like one of those bad news programs. So there might be, we might have some information later on so hang around for that. But like not the little in the point where, but that's just his fucking brutal. It's crazy though.

Speaker 3:          00:48:32       This all happened out of Hannibal Burress his joke like him talking about it on stage.

Speaker 2:          00:48:37       No, somebody filming the person who put it up should be getting credit cause Ha Hannibal didn't do that and he shouldn't be getting the grief either. It was a fucking great joke is a funny joke. It's a joke. Then it became funny bit possible fact. Um, I actually felt bad for him because I don't think he wanted that. I think he just, I think it was just telling a joke. They do it if some of this shit, you know, that's all of that shit is taken out of car, like re everything. Like these fucking people who take your shit. They do the same thing that a news, like a um, a bias news channel or like a political ad we'll do. Like I did this rant making fun of cubs fans versus White Sox fans. And the reason why I did it was because recently Chicago had beaten the Boston team and all I wanted to do was cause infighting.

Speaker 2:          00:49:21       Okay. I didn't believe a fucking word of it. And I, and I went on this whole thing and then I paused and in the end I said, I'm just fucking with you guys. I'm just mad because blah blah blah. They lopped that part off and now it's just a standalone piece that I'm shitting all over cubs fans and I'm defending white sox fans. And then what was funny was I took a wild guess and I actually, people are like, dude, this is like fucking dead on. This is exactly the way it is. It's like I didn't know that but, but the, the point of it is is that they went up there and they deliberately lopped off the thing where I say it's just a joke. So, so there's that and I got a specialist Friday man, we really tried to fucking be interested in that dumb story for the whole time. You just, all you had now we just went to story bill. I don't know where to go with that man.

Speaker 3:          00:50:10       No, I'm thinking about this culture of trying to catch people doing things like that and I, you know, and get upset at them, especially when it's clearly a joke and I had a whole bit and in my act about the difference between jokes that you say on stage and like being in court and getting fucking affidavit. I have a whole bit in my last

Speaker 2:          00:50:28       special about lying. I'm like, I lie on stage all the time. Like if you watch any of my act and you go, I don't, I'm the, I don't see things the way this guy, I don't either. I don't see these things in the way. I see. I'm talking about that around. Yeah. I'll say shit that I don't believe in. If it's funny and that's, I think part of what Chris Rock was saying is that people are getting offended. Comics comics should apologize and less, they actually meant it in a malicious way that the person took it. Like if you, you know, he can go on stage in a bad mood and you can deliberately get an, someone can heckle you or do something and then you get mad and you deliberately try to fucking piss him off and uh, you know, you might owe somebody an apology then, but you don't have to go on TV and fucking apologize to the country.

Speaker 2:          00:51:09       People are doing it because they're scared. They don't want to lose the careers. Then they also, the people have demanded an apology. You would have in kind of say whatever you want. That's not true. You know, you have a career, so talking shit, I understand that. But the thing is, as of yet, I do not have a TV show. Why don't you have to teach better off without it. That's when better off without the fuck you doing to this animated show that I'm doing comes out to you. Wait, you wait, but you're doing great. Stand up though. Yeah, I know. I'm not saying, I'm just saying, but the animated thing was the perfect way to go into the TV because you can get away with anything. Yeah. Cause you can't, you're not going to offend anybody with these animated people. Like what, what message is this going to send to animated children?

Speaker 2:          00:51:59       You know what I mean? What about all the three fingered fucking yellow headed people out there? Are they going to, what are they going to think that it just piss off Asians. Nobody got hurt. No, no headed. As long as I like square heads thinking Simpsons, uh, someone we'll lop would cut it off there and just be like, yeah, what are you gonna do you, you're always, when you ever saying anything on stage that's controversial, you're always going to open yourself up to opportunistic people that just want click bait. There's no such thing as controversy in, in standup comedy. There's no such thing. It is. It is manufactured controversy. It's all complete horseshit. It's one person in the crowd. The amount of times that they've showed clips of comics who said something controversial. You literally hear the crowd laughing on the fucking tape. Everybody's laughing.

Speaker 2:          00:52:46       Taking it as a joke and one fucking person and then you know, and then you just take it out of context, which is out of the comedy club. I mean, I'm trying to think of a joke. Any of my jokes that I could do on the news that wouldn't seem like, you know, I'm doing this bit about Isis and how they're not a threat and I'd like to see him try to invade Florida where silencers are legal and see how far they fucking get now. That's silly and ridiculous and funny. And a comedy club. You then put that on Fox News. Bill Burns says isis is not real.

Speaker 2:          00:53:17       Well what about the soldiers died? We return the controversial tape we'll be playing. What about the soldiers that died? We are here from Florida that actually confronted Isis. When we return, he listens to what bill said. And then after that show and Nancy Grace, we'll pick it up on the next hour. Bill Baer, the standup Comedienne. You might have seen him on such shows as breaking bad bad. I'm going to go out on a limb and say she's a hot shit. If you went out and drag with the, do you think so? She would just laugh Vic. Yeah. It's a fucking shell. Do you think she's just being, well, she was a print. How much do you know how much my face hurts to pretend to be that mad? Every episode. I love coming out here and smoking a little weed and fucking get in a relaxed. My eyebrows.

Speaker 2:          00:54:03       I eat Twinkies. I'll really, I get foot massages. No, I think she would be fun as hell to hang out with. Andy actually get into an argument with, it's just a, she makes unfortunate faces on TV. I think she's probably exactly like she comes off on TV. I bet that's her. Uh, Nah. You can tell you right now. You, me and Nancy Grace driving to Vegas. We wouldn't be laughing our fucking asses off you and I would be laughing our asses off, but it'll probably get ugly with her. I would buy the inland empire. She would loosen up. He thinks, yeah, we'd shut off our cell phones. You're not being recorded. Just fucking, I was held hostage by profanity farts out show she did, but she'd have a good time over. They irritate me for four hours now. This is what you do, right Nancy, what fucking guests?

Speaker 2:          00:54:57       What's the worst guests you ever had that you just wanted to reach through the screen and punched him in the face and then she'd be telling a funny story and then maybe, and that's it. We'd be in, you'd ask her about the Duke Duke Lacrosse case, whether it was she was unfairly accusing them of something they didn't do. I don't watch it on TV. I don't watch the show, but we are, it's funny about her as she looks like Ozzy Osborne in like 1985 during the ultimate center. Like when she wears the black eyeliner sometimes I literally a better looking Ozzie. Of course. Well, I'm more dainty. Ozzie. Less Feminine. More Bruce Jenner. Ask less hard road. Yes.

Speaker 2:          00:55:35       America in trouble. The youth of today to day. Yeah. You know, I saw something, I don't know why this reminded me of, Oh, I think shaving down your Adam's apple was, I was thinking of, I actually, uh, I don't know. Sometime I started talking about torture or some shit on my, one of my podcasts and someone was showing them the devices, you know, the rack, the rack would, they would, they put him on, they tie your legs and they would crank it. Okay. And these guys did an experiment. Was what gave way, was that your tendons or whatever? You know what it was? They actually discovered it was the bone. Oh God. Fucking broke or pulled away. They they put like, it was the creepiest thing ever where they were just like, this is a pig's ankle, which is the closest to a human's ankle.

Speaker 2:          00:56:17       At which point you're sitting in home gone. Okay. Like if they said it was a Yak, like I would argue, I have no idea. So they put this thing on there and they start, they tied this little hook with part of it's neat St. It was just as much like the knee. You got to see this thing and they start cranking this thing and you're hearing it every time it gave way. You're heard a noise. They would do an x ray and you know these fucking scientists are so, oh this is interesting. This is interesting. The patella is still there and the issue, see the middle car, we'll fucking whatever the hell ligament, but what we're seeing is we're seeing is stress in Nashville Femur, which would be a femur and they fucking kept doing it. And what? What gave way it was, I guess I was the slowness of it that made the bone break and not the fucking tendons where if you just get hit quick or something like that.

Speaker 2:          00:57:04       The tenants I, you know, I'm so fucking stupid. I can't remember what they came conclusion with, but it actually broke your fucking bounds. It's amazing what inventions people came up with just to fuck you up, more like to make you more in pain while there were killing you. The two things that I've ever seen, there's very few actually. Maybe cats, monkeys and human beings are the most cats. A mold breaking my bones, the most sadistic like cats, the way they catch a mouse and then fuck fucking let the thing get away and then get it again and give it hope and take it away. But you'd get the death penalty. That's like somebody begging for their fucking life. Right? Yeah. I saw this video one time, this chimpanzee like you know, basic. In the last 10 12 years they've discovered that chimpanzees like the occasional steak and want to eat another monkey because they thought that they were vegetarians.

Speaker 2:          00:57:54       So this fucking monkey trap, this small, it's chimpanzee trapped this smaller one, and he's basically standing on the fucking thing up in a tree. And rather than just snapping, it's fucking neck. It's taking its finger and his thumb and just digging flesh out of its fucking back and eating it as the monkey is underneath that just screaming bloody fucking murder. And you just sit and I, I've dude, I fired a gun. I would have blown. That thing's fucking brains out. Just start a principle. I've seen that. I've seen that. I've seen that video. I've seen a bunch of those videos with chimps. They, they liked to eat king hate chimpanzees should the scary animals, they are definitely should be respected, but they like to eat the organs first. They eat them while they're alive. It's grabbed the, apparently the Oregons the most delicious part to them.

Speaker 2:          00:58:41       So while they're holding onto the monkeys, they're not trying to kill them first. They're just trying to go right to the guts and started eating. Oh Dude, it's just bending. But getting back to you get back to the rack, like how could you, the fucking agony you're putting somebody through. I couldn't do that. I couldn't do that to somebody. Don't you think it was? That was during the time where first of all, people died like way, way quicker. Like people didn't live very long. They live to be alert. If you're lucky, you got 50 years in holy Shit. Like I lived to be 50 whilst the infant mortality rate was really high. There were constantly at war. War was at close range. So war involved like swords and arrows and he thinks about shots. The kind of Fuck Catalan does fucking flaming bodies. You know, they used to literally light bodies on fire because human fat is like a good way of a lighting.

Speaker 2:          00:59:31       Building's on fire because it's so disgusting. So when they would light us on fire, they would light human bodies on fire, launch them and catapults roofs. Hilum first. Yeah, probably. Maybe, I don't know. Whatever they wanted to do, I can't greenway to a text. Sure people, well, when people get doing that, you were saying, where are they? Just going to use all the fucking fuel. They'll figure out a way to just have no waste. We use the waste and it becomes feel, but that kind of life where you're, you know, you're subject to violence and brutality on a regular basis and the movies where the movies, they only show the wars. They don't just show it when they're hanging out playing like a flute. You know what? I think there's probably a lot of war going on pretty much all throughout human history. I just feel like he could hide so much easier back in the woods.

Speaker 2:          01:00:20       Yeah. He just ran into the woods. Yeah. Those are the heroes of comedy. Yes. You hear the floor fucking moving on the horse's back there. You have to figure out a way to get away from the wolves. Yeah, but you weren't going down to whole foods. You a hunting your own food. You were self sufficient. Right. But you had to have your bow and Arrow and all that stuff. You like to be close to town, have a fucking blacksmith nearby, like when you're out there in the woods by herself. It's probably pretty, pretty hard scrabble life. Absolutely. But you know something. Anything that's going to kill it. You kill it. Kill you. I was thinking shoot at you and kill you. Kill it. You anything that's going to kill you out there. It's just, it's going to be a quick like a dude. If a mountain lion ever fucking ran at me, I'd fucking just give him a neck.

Speaker 2:          01:01:02       Get it over with. Dude. I've gotten scratched by a fucking house. Cat. You think I want to fucking fuck with you. God Damn. 140 pound cat and proportionate like they're there. As far as like the strongest house cats or the strongest cats, it's house cats are with some of the strongest pound for pound and mountain lions like right up there with them. Stronger even than like some other cats that are terrifying. How they fight off. Bears went into my youtube video watching. They definitely do was doing all the animals shit. Now is it an animal plant? Is that what discovery? Just when all cars, like they don't fucking do anything anymore. Discovery. Yeah, animals anymore. Well, there's a lot of shows like TLC used to be the learning channel. What do they do now? Reality. That's all reality. I say history jam. That's Tlc is honey booboo you don't have with a history channel is they just ran out of war footage.

Speaker 2:          01:01:53       They just raved. Just got, we got nothing and then they had to show like nothing is interesting to anybody anymore unless there's footage like I hate it when they would do like even like some of the civil war shit they would have to reenact it because before remember when we were kids they would just have drawings of it and they would sort of pan the camera across summit which would put you to sleep and then World War II was the shit cause they would just show him planes getting shot down and all of that. You know it was like a movie. Well they had history channel had like a lot of Nazi shows. They had a bunch of those and then I think after a while they just realize is more money in idiots. This is more money and just reality TV. It's just safe to a certain point in time that you come in network.

Speaker 2:          01:02:29       Well, I mean what I think happened was a bunch of people will watch your reality and Martin watching their shows and the rise at the third hour, right? What happened in the night of the long knives or whatever the fuck. Then just no one cared anymore. And they're just like, all right, if that's what you want, they have shit on like ancient aliens. Like they have a, I mean they have, how many episodes of ancient aliens have they done? I totally believe in aliens, but I don't think anybody has figured out a way to travel from planet to planet and actually live. I think it's possible, but I think that way too invested in it being originally we could figure it out, but we're going to destroy each other first. And I think everything kind of, you destroy yourselves. That's gods. I think fucking checks and balances. I made this thing smart enough to figure out how to get over to this other pot of people that I made, but they got jealousy and envy and I want credit and I want to produce your credit on your fucking rocket ship and all that shit and like they're all going to destroy each other first.

Speaker 2:          01:03:28       Like we'll destroy it before we figure even know how to get to fucking Mars on it by a spell. Where are you going to do, first of all, how do you, how do you, how do you have enough air to get their air? Like in the oxygen? Something that generates oxygen. You'd have to have something to processes. Carbon dioxide generates oxygen. There's a harder thing would be you could, you could probably do that a last, so I guess the question is, well, plants do that, right? Is that what plants too? But that's going to last all the way to Mars. Six months. It's got to last six months and I remember, I don't think it takes six months to get to Mars things. Lots of sand. I think they're saying it takes six months. No, it doesn't.

Speaker 2:          01:04:08       I mean, think about how far the moon is the moon. He just seven days, you know, all this shit. No, it takes six months to get the marks. How long do you think it will take? Fucking years? No, I'm pretty sure it's six months. Let's see. Uh, how many months to get to Mars? He's got a creepy tone right now. I'm pretty sure it's six months. I could be wrong too. I was very self deprecating. It's possible, um, precise. Six to eight months. I think as far as an earth orbits are perfectly circular. But that's like just a drone though to actually get a personal note for this is a, for a person, this is for a person, they're talking about the a man space travel to Mars mission where they're actually going to have to stay there, which is really fucked up. These people are gonna.

Speaker 2:          01:04:52       It's gonna take, uh, about six months to get there to do you realize the fucking balls that takes unbelievable. I'm going to another fucking planet forever. And once you break the Earth's gravitational pull, what is stopping you from missing Mars when that fucker comes around? Talk to relations. I know that, but I'm saying if those things are off. Yeah, they never are though. Jerry. Speed up. Speed up towards fucking, what's the next one? Saturn. Jupiter. They're pretty good at figuring out earth. Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Neptune, Uranus, Pluto loop completed anymore. They're bringing it back though, right? No. Where'd you hear that? I heard recently that they were considering bringing it back as a planet. Did you hear that or read that on a website? This is how they should promote that. They should have like when they bring Pluto back, they should have the scientists dressed in like bell bottoms and shit with like the, the fucking Travolta thank you know like they bring it back like disco assumption.

Speaker 2:          01:06:00       No, bringing it back. Bringing it back. Come on man. I was dressed up like saludo. No, that's too on the fucking note too on the nose. You know what? You know what I hate? You know what I hate in a on a joke writer room is they got a hat on a hat, a hat on a hat. When you have like a joke within a joke, right? Like it's like say say whatever the joke is you fall off the fucking chair and then you want to add another layer to it. They go that's, that's a hat on a hat and it's just like so what if it's still but they don't understand like taglines. If it's still funny. It's funny. Still is funny but if it's not funny it's not funny. No. It's like if you had a half that's fine. How come I can't look at the other fucking hat the next time I watch it cause I didn't even notice it.

Speaker 2:          01:06:42       If you have a hat on a hat and the hat is funny, it's funny. That's what I think. Yeah. I think like they're acting like funny plus funny equals not funny. I think that does that. How does that work? I think that's just a lack of, it's just the different mentality that a comic has versus, there's definitely like a place you can go where it's not funny anymore or we've had a too many jokes or you ruined the original joke. But I think a writers have a different perspective and granted they write for a living and I don't, I just think their perspective is a scene as opposed to your perspective, which is like stand up, you know, looking at it standup wise. No, I'm not looking at it like this is going to, yeah, I just think it's fucking funny. I think as many layers as you can add to it, it just keeps getting funnier.

Speaker 2:          01:07:29       And then if people don't even get it, that's fucking funny. Like why would you even, why would you fucking sit there and make that damn rural? I mean, I guess, you know, I'm going against all of these successful shows, so whatever. I just think there's a different style of writing too. Don't you think there's a different style to way, like you write for standup and the way you write or you would write for a television show? It's, it's just a different kind of writing. I barely know what I'm talking about ever. So, um, I just, maybe I'm just frustrated with pitching jokes and then somebody's going to Ed. That's a hat on a hat. Like a hat on hat. We'll see. That's why I'm telling you a guy like you, your best shit is you just being you without anybody that you have to pitch it to.

Speaker 2:          01:08:14       Cause you know, you have a very year from now when I show up with the six episodes of emphasis for funny, I think you're getting up, you're going to have you heard talking about a cartoon. I'm always 100% functioning too little. My fucking, she love it. Animated, whatever you call it. It's like if you look at like the most innovative, dangerous comedy on TV ever, it's out park because they can get away with those guys. They've done the best social commentary for like 17 years. They don't get the credit they deserve. Yeah. Not even close. They're animals. They're the best. They're and they're, they're so innovative. They're just constantly coming up with new shit like every week. Genius is that for their social commentaries because how simplistic the animation is that those guys that are like, but they can just churn them out but like how finished and polished it is.

Speaker 2:          01:09:06       Yeah. As a brand new joke coming right out of the gate, the first time they era where they just, they just fucking nail it. I think it's different. For whatever reason. I feel like they're going to have to do it for 30 years and then tell people that they're leaving before they're finally going to just acknowledge, you know, they're going to get out the fucking Mark Twain Award and all that stupid shit that you supposed to get. Well, they get acknowledgement just by everybody in loving them. I mean the show is that they have taught pretty much total autonomy over comedy central. They kind of get away with whatever they want. I mean they can, they can pull off shit on their show that no one could ever pull off on another show. Just don't think people give him enough credit. No, I'm not going to change that argument show.

Speaker 2:          01:09:46       I'm with you. I don't think they give him enough credit either, but either way it's big. They can do so much because it's a cartoon and the characters never get old. They don't have to worry about their character like Jj from good times. That shit wouldn't have been funny if he was 80 you know that their stuff is dynamite. We shut the fuck up. Like what are you talking about? No, Jj from good times. We're going to pull that one out of my, well, now that you brought up South Park, I don't think it's going to be that funny, but I think it's going to be amusing consuming music. Show your show. Yes. What's it based on? A childhood stories. Oh, your childhood stories? Yeah. Well basically everybody in the writer's room at that point. Oh, so I just got sick of people groaning about my childhood stories, comedy.

Speaker 2:          01:10:29       I was like, well, what if I fucking animate them now? What are you gonna grow? Net. Huh? Wow. That animated. Yeah. It's fucking annoying. Why are you going to Indianapolis Bill? No, it's fucking annoying. That shouldn't be a t shirt that you sell. I watched that, that story that you told last time you were on the podcast about the guy next to you on the airplane. I am questioning you work on Indianapolis. I watch that. My paper for the most fun I ever had on a flight when he said, I'm going to push this button. And as we're taxiing down, um, taxing over to where we're going to take off. And I was, I was just, Ah, let's, let's see what happens. And he was sitting there reaching for the pocket thing and I'm just sitting there like, let's see, let's see what happens. I had pushed the button.

Speaker 3:          01:11:16       So this, um, this animated show that you wrote, who did you do it with? Just do it all by yourself? Or did you bring some money?

Speaker 2:          01:11:23       Uh, Mike Price from the Simpsons. Oh, great. Yeah, it was just a fucking force. And he put up, he put together this murderer's row of uh, a writing room and um, and then the produce a production company is um, um, wild west, which is Vince Vaughn's company. And that's how the whole thing, like I was just going to make a little five minute vignettes and put them on my website. And then, uh, I don't know. I don't want to happen. I, I I, Steve Byrne, I opened for him or something like that. We were working together or some shit and Vince was there, saw my act wanting to see me, uh, hey, come in and take a general and I had no idea, no idea is no nothing. And it was really, I just took a general like we like you if you ever have anything, you know, ballpark general meeting.

Speaker 2:          01:12:07       Yeah, general meeting. Yeah. And I was just walking out and as I walked out I was like, you know, I kind of got this idea for a cartoon and they wanted to do, when they wait a minute and sit down and three fucking years later we are one year away from it coming out. I mean, it just works slowly, slowly. The, the it, what is the heart? Nobody was, didn't want, nobody wanted the idea and everything and the whole thing was dead in the water. And then Vince was the guy who was like, let's go over to Netflix. And even that guy's an ammo man. He's in there in the fucking pitch meeting, selling this fucking thing. And then Netflix was like ridiculously supportive. They're like, you know, do whatever you want. Netflix is doing wild shit further. Push it further. Yeah. Do you see the ad for a Marco Polo,

Speaker 3:          01:12:52       Marco Polos, a new series of the Netflix is doing on Marco Polo and Gingiss cons, like this huge fucking epic series that they're doing. So they have that orange is the new black, there's doing standup comedy specials. Like they're becoming like a real legitimate network right before our eyes. There'll

Speaker 2:          01:13:08       be on that because they're international and they are so ahead of the game that all you're going to see is just people trying to rip off their business model is what's going to happen. Uh, you know, it's the usual thing. Like, what are these guys? Don't know, they're not going to fucking blah, blah blah, and all of a sudden, okay, all right. And then, then, then the next thing you know, you become the person and then everybody's like, oh, that's the way you do it. Monkey see monkey do. And then I just think people will try to rip off what they're going to do. But they there at the, uh, you know, they were on point, so, so they're cutting their way through the jungle, so there's still going to be out in front of everybody. So I think it's going to be very hard for a, I don't know, maybe the fourth person who tries to rip it off.

Speaker 2:          01:13:53       There might be room for two other people to try to rip off what they're doing. You know what I mean? And then you have like three, like ABC, NBC, CBS of International Television. Well, what they're doing that's unique is that they're taking the money and they're making their own shit. That's the big thing there. There've been doing it for, I did my comedy special with them in 2005 that was originally on Netflix. And then it got sold to showtime, but they were even back then, I mean that's nine fucking years ago. They were taking chances and funding comedy specials and now they're doing real originals that Kevin Spacey show that, um, how's the cards, you know, they're doing and the horsemen, yeah, it's been killing it.

Speaker 2:          01:14:33       And your show, they're doing a lot of Chelsea Peretti. Her standup is on Netflix or a news show. Um, I think, um, Chelsea handler doesn't she have like a whole species? Yeah, she left her talk show as far as I know on a e e to go do a talk show on Netflix, left the network to go to Netflix. That's like, that would not shoot. I'm Alice speak for her, but I don't think that moves gets made two, three years ago. He shows you how quickly it changes. Yeah. It'd be like white men, but I'm on, I'm on television. She's got so much fucking money though. She probably doesn't give a fuck. You know what I mean? She, she said make that much money on. Yeah. She's, she's got a lot of money, man.

Speaker 2:          01:15:19       She's a very, well, she's also, it's not just that, it's books. She saw a lot of books, you know, she's in that stage to where she has like this giant amount of fans that could just follow her anywhere she goes. And I don't know how that works. I don't get like, how do you like, uh, how do you have a TV show and write a fucking book? I Dunno. And do stand up in the constantly. I mean, she does. She does a lot of shit. She's just constantly working. Yeah. That's, I mean, I'm never going to be that busy. I couldn't handle that. Yeah. I'm too busy right now. I think there's a certain level of busy where you just like, you can coast, you could like keep it, keep the fire burning at a certain temperature, certain Rpms, but it goes up and down when it goes.

Speaker 2:          01:16:04       I would think just having a TV show and trying to keep that thing on the rails and have just prevent someone from coming in and fucking it up would be, uh, would be hard enough. That's a big thing. Preventing someone from coming in and fucking it up. Right. Cause that's a real issue. Someone could definitely come in and fuck it up. Yeah. Cause they want credit. Yeah, I got it. They got, you have to implement something that I said again, that's all negative shit. I'm going to try to white whitewash all that. No, not that it hasn't happened to me, but I just, I don't want to get a test. It's our old fucking conversation that uh, everybody knows it. That's, that's what it, that happens in every fucking business. You know. Look at the Geek squad. That was a great thing. And then best buy, it was like, oh hope dirge or make money without us.

Speaker 2:          01:16:46       And then they fucking absorbed it and nobody uses this shit anymore. Squad before best buy. It was just a bunch of nerds who would fucking, it's like Uber, they said they would run around fixing your computers and they dress like nerds, like with the black ties and the white fucking, and then bought them and then they bought them and I've never seen it. It was cool. They showed up. It was funny. They were like embracing being nerds. It's like 10 years ago they had the f I haven't had fucking glasses and they came over and they just fix your shit and it kind of had like this spy vibe to it. Geek squad and they showed up dressed like nerds, but also kind of like a little pulp fiction ESC except without the jacket. And it was a, it was fucking cool. I wasn't aware of them back then then.

Speaker 2:          01:17:24       Then they drove around in little beetles. Yeah. Did. Were you aware of him? Oh yeah. Before best buy bottom. Yeah. I wasn't using right now my fucking laptop died. What happened? Do you use a Mac laptop? Are you one of those guys that gets frustrated? Honestly, I got frustrated and I slammed it shut. Was it an apple laptop or a windows laptop? Apple. See, I would think of, you might be one of those guys that goes, you know what, I'm fucking sick. All this apple shit. Everybody uses apple. I'm going to go windows and I'll see you being hot guy. Now. What I do is I just, uh, I keep computers forever and I keep I iPhones forever. I'm always at least two numbers behind whatever everybody else has. Why do you do that? Because when I say hello, the person can hear me. What does that mean?

Speaker 2:          01:18:11       It means it means I don't need a new fucking phone. Oh, okay. So it's firing. He takes video. I don't even need the gays and kneel at this Gloria screen. Look how beautiful. Look how big that stupid ass fucking thing is. How dare you, first of all, first of all, how dare you. Second of all, the camera on this thing is fucking substantially. You got to see the new camera on the iPhone six. That's what I'm saying. When I point that at my Dick, dude, you can see the helmets. Great. God Damn. Picture a picture. Joey Diaz. That's great. That's great God damn picture. It's too clear. It's fantastic. We clearly look how good that is. Huge. Joey does not look like that in real life. Technology has gone beyond what you've seen, but young bill burr, he does look like that. He does look like that now I'm just, you just see you're looking at them in a little tiny 400 to talk you out of your phone.

Speaker 2:          01:19:04       You obviously love it. Could you make me feel bad about my purchase? I'm happy for you bill. I remember like couple of years ago you were still using mapquest. Do you still use mapquest or do you know? I used, I used the one that's on that, that thing. But the uh, the one that's on your phone. I mean, you know what I hate. I hate like the fucking recycled jokes on the Internet and people like someone would be like, was this film with a potato for like the 9000000th time? You're going to write that and be like, can you just pick a different vegetable? Can you try to elite a little bit original? I do not believe I've ever heard someone ask you. And I know you have home with a potato. It's fucking, it's like this recycled, wait, what? Like those fucking said no one ever. It's like he's fucking like, it's like mad libs.

Speaker 2:          01:19:51       That's true. Said no one ever is pretty common. But effective if used properly. Like I reserve the right to you, said no one ever. If I'd fucking half too. If it's right there, I got to admit I, I would, I would definitely, you'd a few notches I would drop off. Seen watches in your estimation up front. I'm looking at drop a few matches the stratosphere that I have. You went right to build myself back up. I have to fail a little. Nah, once you drop a certain point, you dead to me. I'll take that into consideration. But wait what Wayne said, no one ever within two hours. If I got two of those tweets from you, I would uh, well when people say really stupid shit like khaki comedy, including all the people who now are going to watch this and then tweet that to me and they just think it's absolutely fucking genius.

Speaker 2:          01:20:40       Not realized that like 9,000 people had the exact same idea that water cooler jokes. You know those fucking just gay or you know me. You know about the Shit that Collin Quinn makes fun of those fucking Collin Quinn. Yeah, that it cause people don't even know he's joking. Like you know like one of the beautiful things about knowing Collin and then knowing his tweets is that some people were reading his tweets and they might not get it at all. They might think, do you remember the Colin Quinn show he had on NBC? He had one of the greatest fucking sketches and it was like, it was so much fun. It was like office humor and I remember Bobby Kelly's was the funniest one. It was the high five guy at the office in Bobby just comes walking by. He just like, dude got that new jet ski and he fucking, he just puts his hand up and you have to high five fucking, even the way you high five was hilarious.

Speaker 2:          01:21:28       Mine was somehow I went up to Greer Barnes, not Greer Barnes. I went up to Godfrey and and and said some really white shit to him is Greer Barnes was standing in delivering a package like dude ain't took a recommendation. Something like God's for God's first park was hilarious. Some really stupid white movie. And then Greer is sitting there looking at God like he's a fucking sell on or whatever. I'm totally butchering this, but it just totally tapped into like when you work in those fucking offices, the amount of like this like six jokes and they all just keep telling them that was in, I'm not like those are the only jokes, but there's like six jokes that you can just always get count on for a laugh. What was that was on NBC, right? For how long? Many episodes had called show last. It was sort of the season, right?

Speaker 2:          01:22:14       Only one season. Like 600%. And it was like we're liking it. It was like what tough? It was just on the wrong network. It was what, what tough crowd became. Cause he also had this thing where uh, Patrice and Norton and all of them will be sitting down and just in different areas it was actually shot really cool. And uh, they would just be talking about topics. We had like a live thing. He had these sketches thing. It was a fucking great show. It's a great show. He's a funny dude, man. I want. I did tough crowd. I got to see him warm the crowd up, you know, he does stand up before it and I was like, I forgot how fucking funny kind of coin this. He's really fucking funny. Really good. The best was when he first got on Twitter. If you follow them early and nobody knew what the fuck he was doing. Are you doing gang signs over there? I know I was doing three episodes. Oh it only when he had, when he first got on Twitter and, and so many people didn't know what he was doing. It was fucking funny. They still don't every day, but he does still don't. But he's like Zeplin such an underrated band. It's just a shame. They never had a hit to that. And people are like, what the fuck is that? All capitals.

Speaker 2:          01:23:18       But when you do that you're trolling like dumb high school kids. I think a lot of adults were fallen for that too. And uh, when he would talk about how famous he is and how, who the fuck somebody stepped down in [inaudible]? I don't know. He always, he's always good for a fucking, he's a funny fucking comic man. Watching him do stand up like you really get to appreciate it. I think even live, he's one of those guys you really want to see a live like when you see him, like even in film it's like you're missing something. You're missing half of the Canard. Yeah. Yeah. He's amazing. That show shit never been cancelled. If they're smart they'd bring back. Tough crowd. Tough crowd was off. Fucking great idea. It was our great show. You're speaking to that. How weird is it? There's two shows that have come back that is the comeback came back with the [inaudible] which was a great show was just sort of ahead of its time.

Speaker 2:          01:24:09       But the weirdest fucking thing I ever saw was when our cineo show came back. Dude, he came back with the same fucking haircut, maybe look 10 days older and then had the same guests and it was just, and it was like 20 years never went by. It was, it was like a, it's a long, one of the few times I ever wished that I did like hallucinogens cause I was just like, this is, it was blowing my mind. It blew my fucking mind. He had, I think he had like Dyson or Eddie or, or somebody and it was just like, I felt like I was like 24 again and I was just starting out as a comic when I used to watch it going by, if I get to do standup on this, how am I going to, how am I going to navigate? Am I going to cross over to this crowd?

Speaker 2:          01:24:52       And you know, I dunno. It was just bizarre. They took over his social media accounts when they did that show like East Arsenio. He's like, because he was being too edgy. No, no. That's what they do. That's what they do now on a lot of shows. They demand to take over your social media and they start tweeting for you. How crazy is that? That's what he told me. That signing over power of attorney and like an uh, exact cyberspace kind of way. Exactly like signing their name, your name, and he was trying to get his Facebook back and it's Twitter back. And I was like, what? He was telling me, he was telling me this at the ice house and I was like, you gotta be fucking kidding me. They made, he goes, I didn't want to initially, but I said, you know what? I'm going to be so busy with the show. Fuck it. Let 'em do it. Now I'm trying to get it back. I'm like, oh my God, they just take over your account. Yeah. But if you let them, you just say no. Exactly. No, but you gotta be willing to say no. It might be a deal breaker. And he started Sineal go fuck yourself.

Speaker 2:          01:25:52       Yeah, but came to me. Yeah. But they, you know, if they're thinking that people want to, they want to be ball players, you know, hey, you know, we're willing to work with you. Like

Speaker 1:          01:26:04       want to make this show it hit. That's a Sioux thing. They don't want to get sued by you saying something fucking nuts. And then Ima, if you read the guys' interviews, aren't seeing it was interviews are always great because he doesn't give a shit. And he just Kinda says what he's saying. So they're looking at like, yes. Says Wild Shit. Yeah. Well, I mean, I, I know I just, he's honest, which does not work when you got to sell toothpaste and fucking cars and all that shit in between the comedy. So I think that that's, that's fine. But having never gotten a show on the air, Joe, this is what I feel is going on behind the scenes. We'll McGuire, you know, Chris Mcguire was the head writer, uh, on, uh, he was the head writer over there, so he, you know, he told me it was a struggle from the beginning, but it was also that they were trying to do the same show.

Speaker 1:          01:26:48       They're trying to do the exact same show that they did in the 1990s, which is really strange because I was saying he was a likable guy. I mean, people love them, but it seems like if you found the right vehicle for him, he'd be a great talk show host people. He's genuinely friendly, likable guy. Yeah. I mean, like I said, it was, it looked like the exact same fucking show and I felt like, did I just like miss that this thing was still going on and then he had all these guests from back then. I think that that, like, I think the whole thing could, uh, uh, I dunno. I Dunno. I just want to just stop when I would put it on when it first started. Maybe just did that the first week. Uh, no, no. He kept doing it. They kept doing it.

Speaker 1:          01:27:29       They, they kind of does what they did. I mean, it might've altered a little bit, but that was essentially the show. It's hard to do those fucking shows, man. I could never, I can have a host to talk shop. No fucking way. You don't get to choose your guests. You know, like people equate a podcast to a talk show sometimes. But the thing about a podcast is, you know, I, I like you like I want, I want her to talk to you today. I tell you man, like you man. But you know what I'm saying? Like I don't have to pretend. It's like if you were some guy that I didn't know that was in here that was pitching something I didn't give a fuck about, but the network that my story is a dying and then you got to save them. Oh, those are the worst.

Speaker 1:          01:28:07       Right. And so on. We'd have to jump in. Well, I, I, I feel, I feel bad for, uh, when, when I see a talk show host and has a guest where they're off or they're their, uh, stories aren't working cause it, you see him, you see him like glancing down at the card and then they got to like letterman's the best thing they got to, cause it'll just openly mock the situation. He'll just openly mock you if it goes wrong like that. I'll just let you sit in it going, okay. Yeah. Do you remember Bill Hicks bit on Leno? Oh, the Dorito thing? Yeah. The whole thing about having joy Lawrence on the show and ask, enjoy Lawrence if he has a girlfriend. Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. You know, and, and choices. No, well, yes, we'll shoot things. So, right. He pulls a gun out of his drawer and fucking blows his brains out and is his brain splatter on the wall and the form of an NBC peacock cause he's a company man to the bitter end. Jesus. Dude, that was word for word. No, I did. I forgot all the part about him. Uh, changing clips. He's, he pulls out an Uzi and east suck on a news and he's spraying bullets through his head and he'd change his clips and it's fucking hard gig. Leno loves doing that show that he does now because of that. He does that car show online.

Speaker 2:          01:29:31       Jay's garage watch. I go on that all the time. I love it. Great fucking car collection is insane. It's insane. And it's all like, he's got great taste in cars. Then he's got these fucking cars, like those ones. We got like two shifters and she's got goggles on and stuff. But, um, he had won a car recently, that bank, I crossed, forget it. I got obsessed with it. If you want to look it up. He did. It was an early, a seventies Dotson I think five, 10 and um, they're just the coolest fucking cars. If, if you, uh, if you put like a new engine in the suspension and everything cause it's like, it's like the classic American sustained sedan, but the miniature like uh, Asian version of them. And uh, let's see. Can you get a picture of it before I'd just stammering a fucking complete black hole here on this thing.

Speaker 2:          01:30:17       That's they just fucking bad ass car man. Oh. So they did like a wretch stow, a resto mod version of an old, it's an old Datsun. It's like a Datsun five 10 or something like that doing, it's got that little fucking, the her shift or automatic, it just looks so much fucking fun to drive because my brother had a, uh, the smoothest shift in car ever drove. He had like an 81 Toyota Tercel. And when you changing gears in that fucker, they, it just was like butter. And it was this piece of shit and it was, I just couldn't understand that was that that was a really bad time for American cars where they would deliberately making them to shit the bed. It's 60,000 miles so you would get this perpetual car payment. At least that's the conspiracy theory of it and all of these fucking uh, Toyota cars that to remember that when they started coming out in this, but dominant only went up to 80 miles an hour and everything that you to speed and not while the gas crisis and all that, and the Mustang became the Mustang to became a car like Farrah Fawcett, Provan Charlie's angels.

Speaker 2:          01:31:13       There was a such a hunk of shit. It went from being one of the most bad ass American muscle cars ever to a, just a total plastic, shitty shape, ugly. They made an ugly table within like five to seven years. It became just an absolute and all of that. There was so many of those held over like a muscle car names that just became like a shell of themselves, like the Cougar and it become this big fat ass fucking tutored like sedan, like with sort of a poor man's like Lincoln continental or something. Um, but whenever he, but he is his collection of cars. It's just fun. It's fucking incredible. And just his knowledge of them. That's really cool. Well, he's really passionate about it. That just shows you when you get a guy doing something that he actually likes to, like Jay Leno

Speaker 3:          01:32:00       loves cars. It becomes an amazing show when you have him host the tonight show you like, he doesn't give a fuck about Joey Lawrence, his TV show. He doesn't.

Speaker 2:          01:32:07       Yeah. So he's got it, looked at it like he's, he's trying to, uh, he's, you know, he's making some money and he's going to go buy some cars now. When I was a younger comic, I used to judge them and belows fuck bullshit. You know, back when I thought I was, you know, I should be wearing a leather jacket on stage, you know, like I was saying. And anything think, but now that I've gotten older, I'm like, Nah, fuck, he's doing his show the way it wants to do a show and then he wants to go buy some cars.

Speaker 3:          01:32:30       Yeah, he wanted to make some money. Made some money. Apparently does the word is always been that he doesn't even spend his tonight show money that he'd spends only a standup comedy money. That's where he gets all everything and then the tonight show money, I'll just went to the bank. Can you imagine

Speaker 2:          01:32:46       dollar collapses, poor bastard, get all that money. Like I don't understand having that all in the bank when you're, your account isn't shared up to like fucking two, 300 grand. Yeah, it's not smart and then it's also it is until it isn't,

Speaker 3:          01:32:58       well who knows what all in the bank means though. He might've investments, he might've put it in bonds and mutuals and all that

Speaker 2:          01:33:03       shit. You got to convert it into cash, gold stuff it in your fucking walls and then just some of it in gold and they just got to pray. I haven't all of that fucking money and trying to not, who has that book you read when you were in like fifth grade about the guy catches the big fish and then he's bringing it into this, into inland and all those fish are taken a bite out of it and by the end he's just left with the skeleton. That's what it's like having a ton of fucking cash. Everybody's just going to fucking descend on you. You know you're accounting bills all of a sudden, two plus two equals four is way much fucking more difficult. And they got to charge at $9 million more for your fucking taxes. Why? Why? Cause I have it. You know what I mean?

Speaker 2:          01:33:47       Yeah. That's what they do and all of a sudden everything becomes a big fucking problem. So you just advocate spending it all. As soon as I advocate getting to a certain level of success, getting a machete in a pit bull and sitting on your cash. Yeah, but right. Laid out in the living room. You just sit on a mound of it and you order food, have it delivered and have it delivered. You never leave. He'll bills off the pile of pay for. I have no, uh, my, my, uh, whatever in society. Is Society going to Shit My, uh, my plan is I just embraced the fact that you can only kill me once. That's it. I'm going, I'm, I'm, I'm not going to survive that

Speaker 3:          01:34:30       you hope. But what if it's like groundhog day? Keep dying like that new Tom Cruise movie. The edge of tomorrow we dies over and over. Spoiler alert. Well then I would just get a gun and then

Speaker 2:          01:34:41       how would just walk around like this and I wait for the awful death to come and then I go like that. I like how you thought this through over may a lot of really good points. You know, I learned it buying it. Buying an old house. Yeah. Oh, you going to be the guy who lays in a shallow grave and waits for people to attack

Speaker 3:          01:34:58       you food supply. Then you sit up like a Zombie. Me Know. I'll be more clever than that. I'll probably set up a fake civilization and then be outside of that civilization and the real civilization like, so people come in to raid and then fucking launched down on him. He's, he just words fire what I'm saying. Listen, I, I've planned this out. No. If, if the shit hits the fan, I hope the, um, where the fan explodes. That's what I think too. Like if yellow stone blows and we wind up living in some sort of a perpetual nuclear winter for the next hundred years, I hope the lava lands on my fucking head. I don't, I don't want to be one of those absolutely. Hardscrabble people out there in Antarctica trying to eat seals and stay alive. Help reinvent the wheel. No, I don't find that. I cause what you're gonna do then what are you going to do? Yeah. That's like

Speaker 2:          01:35:47       realization went through a divorce right in there. The guy that gets like the flop house, you know what I mean? Like you're just, you're just going to, you're never going to build it back up in your lifetime. So why not leave with a flat screen TV watching MMA shit, whatever you want to fucking watch. And then the ice still a bit about that. Just when that Korean debt, little fatty, they're over in Korea was talking about how he's going to shoot a fucking warhead. And I was nervous until he said la and I was like, perfect dude, right at my fucking giant forehead. I don't even want, I don't even want to know. Just hear that whistling sound like what is that? Somebody watching bugs bunny. What does that whistling sound? And then it just fuck it lands right on my house and then that's it.

Speaker 3:          01:36:27       Yeah, you don't want to be the guy who's barely survives and has kids and then dies where your kids are like standing over you and they're eight and you know they can't live on their own. You're, you're fucking, you're dying in front of their eyes. Like you don't want to be that guy and you don't. You also have to take into consideration that even if the human race survives, eventually it won't, whether it's a million or a billion years from now, eventually the earth will no longer be able to sustain life because the sun will burn out. So like,

Speaker 2:          01:36:59       well, it's not going to last forever. I'm just talking about like our lifetime. If some bullshit happens, I don't want to go back to them to the world where like boils and shit and warts on the end of your nose or an issue now because there's no more cvs is and shit, whatever the Benadryl a crap you'd put on it and then everybody starts looking like a, which I like. They live under a fucking bridge.

Speaker 3:          01:37:19       Do you know that it's ever gotten a warrant? Other nodes know what I'm saying? It'll back in the day. So cvs keeps us from getting warts in the nose. That's another

Speaker 2:          01:37:27       I'll take care of. The Universe is gone, compound w is gone, dollar collapses and all of that Shit. Everything stops being made. It's done.
