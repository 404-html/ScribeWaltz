Speaker 1:          00:00:01       Great overlap. Do you drink? Do you want to zero alcohol? Caniquan sure. If you have it. One. Yeah. There you go. Phil. Zero alcohol. Let's get crazy. Excellent pace ourselves. She takes cheers, sir. I'm going chug this. Whoa. Don't do not get to that too dangerous. Zero alcohol. How many calories though? We scare calories, Bro. You stay alive. That's trying to get plenty of calories already. I have to ask you, did you drive it in the Hemi? No, I didn't. I got dropped off in a Chevy. Oh my God. This is outrageous. I had one for a little while. It's just a little while. Yeah, I figure like you would have to have one for quite a long time. It was fun. Well, okay, I'm going to backtrack a little bit. So first commercial, right, that, thank God I hear me right. I did six of these things and around commercial three I, uh, I was talking to my agent and I said, man, you know, if they ask you to do another one, oh shit. Here we go. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:01:02       That's the worst I've ever looked at my life. I really felt like I was sitting in a desert like no one's ever going to see these commercials, and I wasn't going to know what a Hammy is incorrect. I could not have been more wrong. Yeah, there it is. Look at that bad. I asked you, did they give you one or did you just go out and buy one? Well, I said, listen, if they, if they want me to do another commercial, see if you can get a vehicle out of them. Right in. My agent was like, you know, make it their problem. He calls him up. He goes, hey, I don't know if you know this, but your Hamy Guy, your spokesman is driving around Los Angeles right now and a Suzuki sidekick. Oh. And they're like, what's my name is not the fucking die. So at the same thing, it's the lightest.

Speaker 1:          00:01:45       It's a box Skype. If you could put a string to it and float it in the years that, that shitty looking jeep thing. Yes. Oh Wow. You have one of those? I did read. I don't know why. For some reason I liked that thing. I've got it in college and as my way like it. Yeah. It was cool for a tailgating and shit. There it is. Yeah, that's, that's the ll cool j versus, I didn't have that one. Let's see. No, I think I saw that in a video one time cause that's, that's the one I had. Right. You've got that hard top. Damn. Yeah. I had total that thing in North Dakota one time hit black ice. I mean a gust of wind just knocked me off the road and I was in a ditch, but it was, uh, you know how people in motorcycles, they'll see another motorcycle and they'll wave.

Speaker 1:          00:02:28       It's like a little club that you're in and jeeps do it too. And I started doing that to others who Zukie sidekicks and out of port for a reason, I'd wave to them nine times out of 10. It's like a overweight black lady. And I just went with that and I'm like, what does he do it? I was like, we're in the club man. So, but yeah, uh, people like Nice cars, but to do that with shitty cars too. Yeah. That's what, that's the next level that's more fun. Like I see you, did they give you when they give you a hemming? It was a, uh, uh, 1500 dodge ram quad cab black lot of chrome feel comfortable on it then I loved it. I loved when I first got it. You know, it's like, it's like in the middle of, you know, I did six of those commercials.

Speaker 1:          00:03:09       So as ride around La with the windows down, just blasting, you know, Leonard Skinner and shit. Yeah. The comedy store and like park it, I made, they hated park in that thing and that then that lot, because it's gigantic, it's a wide and they're like, really man, can you just have somebody drop you off? Brendan chavs been showing up in his, uh, he got a raptor. Oh yeah. Realize how wide those things are until he's standing in front of him. Like huge as a fucking giant vehicle and then trying to valet that thing anywhere in Los Angeles. You know, it's a lot of tiny little Mexican dudes are like, really man. Well the worst is if you try to valet a stick shift. I tried to give a valley my keys to my bronco and he didn't know what to do. I go, you don't know how to drive a stick shift.

Speaker 1:          00:03:50       He goes, no. I go, what the fuck are you doing here man? How can you have this job? Yeah. Yeah. That should be a part of the a resume. I can't drive all cars. It's crazy. Yeah. My, I don't think most people know how to, you know, and do what an under 30 could drive a stick. I don't think so. No. Going into is going gone. Yeah. Porsche doesn't make them any more. The only American muscle cars were one of the last holdouts like corvette and Camaro. I haven't driven a stick in a long time mustangs. You know, you want to try? Sure. Today actually, the last time I did, I was in Costa Rica and I rented, I rented a car and I'm like, I just assume all cars now when you rent them are automatics. You know, you get to know the country. It's, it's what ever, and so I'm pulling out of the, uh, the lot and it's like, oh shit. It's been admitted. It was pretty embarrassing.

Speaker 1:          00:04:42       I got this. Yeah. When you're in Italy, they all drive stick shifts. Even like minivans. Yeah. It's weird. Yeah. Everything's a stick shift over there. I'm not sure why. I don't know. What, what's the advantages and disadvantages? I mean, what do you prefer? Well, if I was in where I was in Italy, it was in Ravello, which is a very small little roads. It's very tiny and it's like crazy congestion because of tourism. Yeah. And uh, the guy was always on the clutch back and forth, back and forth. I was like, yeah, this is, you gotta be annoying as fuck. You'd be having automatic just like La, right? Like if you're in, if you're commuting to la bumper to bumper every day, you're going to want an automatic exact, that's what happened, right? I think you're right. Yeah. Yeah. It's just more comfortable lip lift the car to the work.

Speaker 1:          00:05:25       But if you're on a mountain road, like the angel's Crest Highway, Oh yeah. You want to shift. There's something cool about being in command of the vehicle and you killing it when it's manly. Yeah. It is, and he got a dick in your hand and if it's a woman, I've got to go, Ooh, don't get too close to this one. Yeah. She likes driving stick shifts like, well, she's a rebel. Right. She might be great in bed maybe. Yeah. For a little while. And then I didn't bring her house. She gets mad at you for email for 12

Speaker 2:          00:05:58       years ago. I didn't even know you that what the fuck? I can't go back and find this. Where's that phone come from? That's a flip phone. Zukie sidekick. We were looking at that thing from ces at Jamie pulled up. What does that goofy thing called? These are good, right? I'll really, I don't feel like I'm drinking a nonalcoholic, it tastes like a regular beer. Um, planet computers. Cosmo communicator, which is like, it's outside of thing that is, that is wasted. Someone was doing coke and they decided, is that having a space ship? It does. It looks at it lucky. These has a planet or a spaceship on the front of it. It looks like one of those metal wallets that you get to keep your credit cards. Yeah. But that shit is preposterous. Missing your fingers. Who makes that fat? Fucking hands am not going to fit on that thing.

Speaker 2:          00:06:53       Yeah. He's not going to be able to do that at this point. We're so used to doing this. Why go back and go to back to that now? Do you ever go sideways in your iPhone? Uh, yeah. Just to take a picture. Yeah, but never a typing. No Way. I thought that was the move. I'm like, oh, once we go sideways, that's going to be the shit. Have you tried on an iPad? Uh, have not. It's not bad. Yeah. Sideways. Yeah. Like when you have to type on the full screen, the full cohort of hands. Not Bad. Yeah. It's not perfect, but it's way better than just your thumbs on an iPhone. Yeah, that makes sense. Especially if you can type, I used to think I would never get used to that. Just that you know the, the, the screen without feeling it. Look at that little front screen.

Speaker 2:          00:07:34       Like you've got a bunch of shit that comes in on it. Look at that whole like apps and stuff. I guess. Boy that's going to, no one's buying that song. How am I gonna do that thing? How much is, there are so many options now. If you don't like apple and you're committed to like an android phone, there's so many options. Why would you buy that thing? What? I don't even know what companies that whom exactly. That's also part of the problem, right? Yeah. That'll be gone. Like where do you bring that thing to get it fixed? Yeah. If the screen cracks and you bring it to the mall, what is it? Yeah, the cosmo communicated, Bro. I'm going to have to go to the future and fix this thing. Yeah. We can't do this in 10 minutes. This thing's a mess. I mean, I got a cracked screen now and you know, it's not even that bad, but I've seen people walk around with like damn spiderweb on their phone.

Speaker 2:          00:08:20       I'm like, when are you going to go get it fixed? What's the point? It's the glass was falling off. This is an indication of you needed to get your shit together. Yeah, that's true. Yeah. If your phone looks like a like a haunted house. That's a good one. Yeah. Let's go into like, uh, you know, see if those girls going to be crazy. How cracked is her screen? That's a good point. Like gimme your phone, like a girl who can deal with a little crack. That's probably the, okay. She's cool. Just a little crack in the window in the corner. No big deal. It'll fine. She doesn't give a fuck. She's easy going. She doesn't even need to wear makeup bro. You know what if he's had to do like this and get the light just right cause it's like a dam. It's a full [inaudible] get tea because that part of the glass won't work.

Speaker 2:          00:09:04       What about the other way they're going with the flex phone? Because this isn't the one that broke, but this is another one that came out at ces to that they'd read called Samsung recalled the ones, I suppose they were called all of them. Huh? They'd unreleased date. Now they're not going to, who knows when they're to come out and they break in like crazy. Apparently flex phone. Is it flexible bins? Yeah. But how does that one work? All I'm seeing is like, yeah, opened up video of that. Yeah. The Samsung one had like a little teeny, uh, I don't know if you look online in the each slash aquarium that we put sea monkeys in, it does, right? It looks like one of them ones. It's like a pillar and a shitty hotel in Miami or somewhere by full for hours. Someone needs to clean the tank.

Speaker 2:          00:09:50       They have a waterway, has a flexible and it looks way better than the Samsung one. It looks thinner and it looks like they just nailed the design better and on the side of it. What's it? Yeah, it's a different car. I don't know. No, no, no. Sorry. Royale Flex Pie beat Samsung. And why wait? A market sells out. That's what this one was folded. Folded in half. Yeah. Yeah. They're, they're making these things where you can flex them and bend them like a thousand times. Oh, how weird. Yeah. That's weird. How am I supposed to fat? That thing is, that's like Karen, a VHS tape in your pocket. Right. I mean, I'm trying to imagine the advantages and disadvantages of watching porn on that thing. Oh, there's advantages. Yeah. Cause like Lassi your ass and then you got to turn your phone upside down. That's pretty wild how it works.

Speaker 2:          00:10:41       That is eight. Yeah. Well kind of hoping it works so that the version three or four in a couple of years, it's way better than these broken ones. Well for sure. You're going to see people at concerts holding a blue, it looks like 12 inch iPads because it's going to be these goddamn things in the future. I've seen that before. Now would you do that? Because they're assholes. Yeah. They're everywhere. I mean you're right. Yeah. I hate it. Especially like a comedy show. It's like the, the phones bad enough. I pad, I have a Tesla and uh, the Tesla has this huge screen. Right. It's enormous. Yeah. Yeah. And you get so used to it. Yeah. So I go from that to another car with a little tiny navigation screen like that. Is this bullshit? Yeah. It's funny how you get used to things. It's like, I'd rather have a Thomas Guide when I first did you have on those and he came to la.

Speaker 2:          00:11:32       God, he had to pull over every five feet. Bill Burr had one of those as recently as 2011 wow. Came to my house. I really came to my house in his fucking Prius. He still has a Prius. That asshole that's probably got $1 billion is going to fuck it. Prius. He pulls into my driveway and a, I see the Thomas Guide is backseat. He's like, yeah, those that navigation shit with that goes down. You can't figure your way around town. Yeah. You're lost up in the hills. No connection. The Thomas Guy Works every time I knew how to do it, man. I get back in the day. Oh Ie 10 I know how to do that. You go eat 10 that's why I need to go write it down. And that was always dangerous. Fuck up. And all of a sudden you're in a Mexican community. Chickens or run across this street.

Speaker 2:          00:12:18       Sounds great. Is Sun Valley sketch never been to Sun Valley? I think it is. Yeah. There's lots of, I'd been there once. I got to think I got lost. I was like, this is, this is not. So when you got rid of your Hemi, did you say, hey, this is from the Hemi guy, like this should be worth some money? Oh well it was, I thought a kid like auction at all. Yeah, on Ebay. Like I took pictures with it and everything. It didn't work. It was like, I think it was when gas was at its highest price and paper. Like no, I think we're moving on to other things. So fucking high, no it's closing in on five bucks a gallon again. But I had it for about two years. Once you get rid of it. Well I was married at the time and that thing was hard when I would leave and she'd had that car.

Speaker 2:          00:13:07       It was just hard to back into the, the garage or any, we have a small two door to two car garage and it was hard to get that thing in there. And so she, she, she convinced me that we didn't need it. We leased a Lexus Rx rx three 50 for awhile. Those are dope. I liked them. I like it when you drive it like the backup camera and those things. That's very nice. Yeah. We drive a truck and then you get into a little car like that. You're like, oh yeah. I was like a dancer, right? Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:13:40       What was your first car? My first car was a 1973 Chevelle Chevelle, s. S it was a shitbox. I drove it from the guy's house to my house and then it died. It never, it never worked again. I take, I drove to my girlfriend's house and then I drove back to my house and then it died, and then I called the guy up, my hand, me your fucking car died. He came and gave it. He gave me the money back and took his car. He said, what happened to my car? I'm like, a died. Just doesn't work. Wow. Like a day. I had it for a day and then my was horrible. Yeah. Then I had a 1968 four four two that are wrapped around a telephone pole. Oh Shit. Yeah. Whoops. Hydroplaned yeah. Yeah. If you didn't know how to drive back then and you had to like kind of balding tires.

Speaker 2:          00:14:25       Yeah. And you hit some water. Yeah. Cars would just go sideways and you know what is this like? You're floating in there. Yeah. It's crazy. It's a crazy feeling. You can't do anything about it. Nothing about it. They always tell you to turn until it nothing's happening. I was just going sideways. I was like, I can't believe this shit. I just got this car. I had that one for a few months and then bang, fucked that one up. Just hydro planning. Just hung by yourself. No, I was with a couple of guys from a school. He might get hurt. No, we're all right, but it fucked the car up. I was in a fee era member fee arrow. Yeah. My sister had one of those. It's like a little key chain Ferrari. Yeah. Remember they used to do so small. These are do Ferrari kits for those.

Speaker 2:          00:15:02       Yes. It turned into a fake Testarossa. Yeah. Put a car on there. Yeah. Those were, those were interesting. My friend Joe had with those two. Those were cool little cars. Jim Carr, right back in the day. It was like either in my hometown. It was like, it is ridiculous car. Great. Then this is adorable. Those cars are so gross when people do that. Yeah. And it's obvious what's like, what do you, no one wants that once you get is that one that can't that great job. That's crazy. That one actually looks good. Yeah. What kind of tricks? I'm really dumb girls with that. You go to Miami, you let me see your cell phone or the really dumb ones. Like if that's like, if you were only looking for really dumb gals. Yeah. That's your car. Dumb gold diggers. Those louvers. What is, what does that in the back?

Speaker 2:          00:15:57       Yeah. It looks like, yeah. It's probably a plastic rear window. Oh my God. They make some cars with plastic windows just to save weight. Okay. Relax. Relax with that. Yeah. We, uh, my buddy and I, he, he had one of those, we hydroplaned spun around a couple of times, totaled it, hit another car that was parked at a body shop and they had just finished it. He's like, cool. Uh, I guess I'm doing two cars fixed. Totaled by slamming into a car that was just finished at a body shop. Yeah. It was a Sarah Uber is that guy's friend. Get on Uber. Yeah. I love Uber. I wonder how much that's preventing drunk driving. I just had this conversation. Yeah. I think what mothers against drunk driving mad, you know, maybe even the government should like kick in. You'd be like, you know, these guys are saving lives.

Speaker 2:          00:16:58       Yeah. For sure. If you get, cause if you're not doing that, then you're drinking and driving most likely, most likely. So it gives you a real easy option. Yeah. And it's so quick. It's so convenient. You don't have to pull cash out. It's, it's great. It's kind of a weird organization of both of them. It's like they're trying to figure out if their employees or their contractors and then there's like this fact that you're just getting into someone's car. You don't know them. Yeah. Yeah. I mean you assume that if you get a limo, but there's a background check, right? If you get a cab, you living on the edge. Right. That's how I was going to say. If he never know Robert De Niro, you look at me. Yeah, we're not talking about a fucking psychopath. Right. That's what you like. But you will get caught like New York City cab drivers, you'd get characters and you get either like a angry white dudes or like a guys who come from other countries.

Speaker 2:          00:17:50       I can tell you cool stories. Yeah, you get like characters, weird smells and shit crazy smells, lots of weird music but possibly a Voodoo doll. But now you know what you get when you get in New York City cab driver, you get advertisements and you'd screens like they have little laptops facing and the play these these credit card machine back there and they play these, these videos about things about restaurants and this and that shows that it's its own network at this point. Yeah, like just the cab network. It is kind of right. It must be, but yeah, I've seen that the copy has their own little loop that they plugged Jimmy Fallon and I mean I've seen him down there many times doing stuff. I remember they used to do the HBO show Taxi Cab Confessions. Yeah. That was crazy. I enjoyed that. I was like, who the fuck is signing this release?

Speaker 2:          00:18:37       What are you giving these people? Like I just want to be on TV. And I would say the worst stuff. Like if you're fucked up on coke and you get into a a cab and you start just talking shit about all the crazy sexual stuff that you like. And then, and then afterwards they're like, hey, you're going to be on HBO. You're like, fuck yeah, I am inside that thing. And then you wake up in the morning. That's true. We'll call this, uh, this waiver at the right time. Yeah. That's gold. That's a good move. How does that work? Does that count? If you're hammered? I, there's gotta be some loophole. I always wondered about that. Um, the catch a Predator show. Yeah. Why the fuck would they sign it? They have to sign a release. Do they? Yes. Or cops. They have to sign a release.

Speaker 2:          00:19:25       Yeah. You have to sign a release. So yeah. And then there's like the, is it entrapment and even, you know, there was that whole thing too. Well that show's definitely entrapment, but it's entrapment. I support. Yeah, totally. I supporting Trapman if it's like, Hey, do you want to fuck a six year old? And they're like, Yo, do okay. Get in the cage fucking piece of shit. That's right. Yeah. This is starting to trap me in the hall for you in a fucking anybody under 18. Right. Or how do they get away with that? How do they get them showing their face? Maybe because they were proven guilty. You waived your rights, but just by being guilty, you have no rights when you're, I don't fell it. Right. Thank you. And you're selling, you have no rights. Is that right? Well, you have rights. Bernie Sanders wants you to be able to vote, even if you're a terrorist.

Speaker 2:          00:20:12       If you've seen that, he's like, yeah, anybody in jail for anything. He's was like, you should still be able to vote. Like, whoa. Okay. I don't know. There's a lot of people in jail. That's true. What if they count as residents of the state? Like it have. You have like a maximum security prison somewhere. Right? And these prisoners have everything like they have all day, right? Yeah. Then what I need to do, and they registered to vote while they're in there. If you have a few hundred thousand prisoners, yeah. You literally can shift an election one way or the other. That's true. All you'd have to do is get into that prison and go, hey guys, here's the deal. Um, I'm, I'm for shortening your fucking sentences. Okay? Yeah. I'm forgetting you better lawyers. People would start campaigning and prisons. That's legit, man. Yeah. Like these laws are bullshit and you can bribe him real easy with the little ketchup.

Speaker 2:          00:20:59       Cigarettes. Cigarette, bring in cigarettes, trucking cartons of cigarettes. How did you win this election? Marlboro reds. What's that guy's name? Booted. Judge. Judge. Judge, what's his name? How do you say his name? Tulsi. Gabbers my girl. I'm voting for her. I decided I liked her. I met her in person cause it, I don't know. I give up. I give up and not paying attention. Anything else? Telson Gabbert uh, but um, if you could go into a prison, like what is a, what's a B? What's a giant prison population? What's the biggest, biggest one? I don't know. We think the biggest one is the biggest one. Uh, I don't know if it be in New York, California. There was not what? It isn't there? A giant one in Colorado that Joey was talking about. There's a, they take the serial killers. They stopped him on the ground.

Speaker 2:          00:21:47       Like what is the, that, what's the biggest one? Uh, 2004 he looks at, okay. Did you say 50,000 prisoners? I don't know much about that. That's probably a lot of people think about spread up all Rina, right? Yeah, that's true. Okay. Well No. Okay. 50 60,000 the biggest one. The biggest? Yeah. What's the smile? It's, well, it was probably some Odin rinky dinky mass, but a bit, I'm not gonna stay in jail. No. Yeah, I'm going to say a little lighter. I'm going to say thirty thousand thirty thousand the biggest, they put money on this. I'll put a dollar on this. I don't give a fuck, bro. I'll put, I'll bet you a Heineken double zero shit. We got too rich for my blood. What do we got? Jimmy's confused. I have to be very specific about what I look up to find the answer. So do you want largest maximum security?

Speaker 2:          00:22:39       Sure. Yeah. Killers. Not people who smoke weed known as Alcatraz of the south. The Louisiana state penitentiary. We go has it inmate population of 5,000 that's it. Damn. That's maximum security. So like criminals, if you go a little bit less than it might be a little bit higher, but okay, let's go with thieves. Let's go with a medium security or maximum is like violent prison. Yeah, the biggest prison. The largest prison. That's one thing that popped up. Give maybe we're way off 5,000 is a lot because it looks bigger. The X and Florence supermax prison, there's one old supermax prison. That's the one I think you're talking about. It's even higher, but that would probably have way less people trying to see if it says, oh, that's even higher criminal level. That was like where they put the ice 23 hours a day. Tom Single cell confinement.

Speaker 2:          00:23:35       Um, 5,000 is a lot of people can find me as so weird cause like we're just, we're killing you, but we're just killing you with nature. We're going to kill you with old and shitty nutrition and just can keep you on a box with your own brain and that weird. Yeah. It's like it might be more cruel to put someone into a small cage for 23 hours a day. Then instead to just killed him? I think so, yeah. Have you just kill you? It's over with. Yeah. And you're saying it's suffering? Yeah, hundred percent yeah. 100%. Like that was uh, my, my take on uh, Chelsea manning who's now free. Yeah. Like they tortured her. They tortured. They did? Yeah. She was naked in a cage by herself for years. I think it was like the, the hole she was in solitary when I have to find the sound. Once Jamie's telling with this search,

Speaker 3:          00:24:25       I'm like looking around as a, the one in California has male only where Manson is, it's got 3,500. There's one in Illinois, medium security. It's got a thousand.

Speaker 2:          00:24:33       Okay. So we're way off by a factor. So pessimistic thought it was going low and I was off by a factor of 10. I don't know if it's

Speaker 3:          00:24:42       counting then too. There's private ones and I don't know if I can get the numbers

Speaker 2:          00:24:44       private, those dirty bastards stuff. I mean on top of each other. It's called the ones make sense. If there were 30,000 inmates in one place, a man, it would be hard to contain that and control that. Yeah. What's the largest private prisons if that's, yeah, so, but the Chelsea manning thing, she was in solitary confinement when she was still a Duke. Does that count like a, as her being like kind of two different studies say that you say Bradley or do you see Chelsea when she hadn't changed yet? I think we have to ask, can you still say Bruce Jenner won the Olympics or did you say Katelyn? Well Bruce, when they limpic no, no, no. Kaitlin. What does it say? He's Caitlyn now. You can't get it now. You know if you dead name him, you'll get kicked off of Twitter. Dead naming. Do you know the dead naming is no, I never heard of it. You didn't know. So say if you become Joe Honda a reap, if you decided at this stage of the game, you know what? Fuck hammies and transitions. Yeah, I'm, I'm, I'm wearing time for Prius. Yeah, it was time to get my legs waxed. The, what do we got?

Speaker 3:          00:25:44       Reeves County detention complex. And pesos. Texas has a combined capacity of 3,763 prisoners in it's three sub complexes.

Speaker 2:          00:25:53       Wow. So that's probably about as big as it gets. Yeah. Does that car and you still can't get anything over 5,000. Yeah. So it's in the 30s 3,300 6,500 what about the world? So if you, you've changed your name of Joel Rape and uh, I started saying, Hey John Reape what's it like wearing dresses? Pretend you're a girl that's dead naming you. I dead name new cousin called you John Because I choose name is Joe Hahn rat. Right? Well, but, but Bruce Bruce is the one who won the Olympic. Yeah, but that's his dead name. Well that's what he was going to be an asshole. John, you're so insensitive. So I believe this. I hate in this day and age, I'm gonna make you subscribes to list them in the hall. It Alondo podcast. Get your shit together. Shit. You need to get up times, Bro. So way behind. I was just kidding about Moses a moron.

Speaker 2:          00:26:42       I don't know what she's doing. Yeah, I don't either. It was a good name though to throw around. Yeah. Alyssa Malanda cause she has, she's active on the, on the Twitter sphere. I believe so, yes. She's very political. Yeah. She's always arguing with people. I think that was one of them. People, you know, they, they booted Jon Woods, you know, Jon Woods, the actor, they booted him off the Twitter can. What's happened? Naughty. I don't think he did anything that big a deal. What it, first of all his jobs, refresh my memory. I'm sorry. John Woods. People probably be mad if they probably know this, but New York City's Rikers island as a population of 11,000 but I don't know if that, they're all prisoners are not what I mean like there's probably workers that live on the red hat. Do they really? It says it can get accommodated to 15,000 prisoners.

Speaker 2:          00:27:34       15,000 prisoners. Yeah. Now we're in the neighborhood is when a Turkey that's got 10,900 wow. Okay. So that's about as big as it gets. That's a lot though. If you go to a theater, like if you did an arena like 15,000 peoples like Madison Square Garden, that's all a lot of fucking criminals. Yeah. You got a baton. So the, the Chelsea manning thing, like now she's free, but then she got locked up again for contempt of court. But I think when she was locked up in solitary confinement, they took away her clothes. They wouldn't let her have closed because they thought she was suicidal. Really? It's just an excuse. So when they, okay. So when the quiche household was a male, he's in a Bradley. I'm trying to know. They don't do it. What? So when Chelsea won the Olympics, Yeah. Um, was, that was what she chose me. I tend to do that.

Speaker 2:          00:28:34       Let's see. In a male prison. That's a good question. And then as a female, does he go to a female prison? That's a good question. Okay. I don't know. Maybe that's why they put her in solitary. Oh, right, right. Protected from toots. Then that's kind of a loophole that, uh, let's say if I know I'm going to prison and I got like a year before I get sentenced, I might just go ahead get that sex cig. So I'm with females. Right. I Dunno. Maybe change anymore. You just have to identify. Oh, okay. There you can. Oh, good. Did you see that? Um, male who identifies as a female just broke all these world records and weightlifting, the new one that just came out. Wonderful. That's, congratulations everybody. You broke everything. I fucking so progressive and so preposterous that we broke everything. You have men that are women when women's world records in fucking weightlifting, which is the dumbest shit for men and women to compete against this every one thing.

Speaker 2:          00:29:35       Even though I like the tennis argument, it's like, well, you know, Billie Jean King beat Bobby Riggs. Yeah. But Bobby Riggs was 55. She was 29 and they say that he threw the match because he bet against himself. Oh, right. He was a big gambler. That was what I heard. Yeah. I would say that too of I lost. Yeah. You know, I would say a through the match. Yeah. Well, yeah. Basketball is tennis. The woman, the one, yes. Says Chelsea. This is uh, the women who's winning says not Bruce Jenner records. Okay, let's get a look. Oh my God. Here we go. Huh. That seems like a very strong man.

Speaker 2:          00:30:15       Yeah. So rich, how much weight is that? It doesn't look very, a lot of weight. So listen, this is all about, this is about reps here. Yeah. It's 300 303 15 yeah. Okay. That's as ridiculous amount of weight for a woman lift and to [inaudible]. You're going to be a real woman, a biological woman. Excuse me. And lift that kind of weight. You have to be a real outlier. Yeah. It's very rare. Yeah. But this is so ridiculous. Wow. What is this? This is, what is this guy's quote? What does it say? One guy that comment say, congratulations on your excellent performance. Screw. Anybody who tries to knock achievements, the hard work speaks for itself. Hey, whoever you are, fuck you. Yeah. Fuck you. And your nonsense here. The reason why they shit is happening in the first place because people tolerate this and that is nuts.

Speaker 2:          00:31:01       If you, if you had a daughter that trained her whole life to be a weightlifter and she's really into it and this fucking guy decides, he identifies as a woman and then compete as a woman in weightlifting, it's just fucking stop. Everybody just stopped. You're in crazy town. This is officially crazy out. Yeah, out of our fucking mind. How it's legal. What time was it legal. It has nothing to do with being open minded or tolerant. It has something to do with logic. Just basic reason. This is craziness. This is you're enabling people to do something that's preposterous. This has nothing to do with being open minded are kind to people. I'm 100% for people being trans. I'm 100% for people doing whatever they want to do. Just don't hurt anybody and I'm cool with that. Saint Mary, but this is just, you're in make believe town.

Speaker 2:          00:31:46       Why not? Pretend you're a fox and go live in the forest like you're, you're in. Make believe this is make believe you can't. You can't just decide you're a woman and compete with women. Right? That's make belief you, there's no advantage. Make belief that's make believe is my advantage. I fucking know there's an advantage. Yes, everyone knows this is crazy. I want to see that in the NFL. You know, you got like, what does that before and after? Is it two different looks? That's, I need to see this person in a sec. I don't want to shame this person. Look, someone's letting her do this. Right? You know, it's nice to problem. That's the problem. They should. There should be a transgender league or there should be some rules where you have to compete with the chromosome, your birth. You don't have to fucking compete.

Speaker 2:          00:32:31       Most people don't compete in organized sports. Most people don't know. And if you're trans, maybe that should be something you can't do it. And particularly for girls who transitioned a boys, you know that school in Texas that won't let this girl is transitioning to a boy. They won't let her compete with boys. So they make her compete with girls and she's on fucking testosterone. So she's taking testosterone to be, or he's taking testosterone, whatever you want to say it. I get so confused. Yeah. To become a board Zur is taking testosterone to become a boy. Yes. And then now is forced to wrestle with women with young girls. In fact, all jacked. Right Jack? Like a boy. It's like a boy wrestling girls crazy. Probably pop a boner doing that. I don't think she has one yet. You can get a little thumb. You grow thumb.

Speaker 2:          00:33:18       Yeah. That's what happens. Oh yeah. The clearest gets a little bit bigger. Yeah. And did the ovary sort of like start getting suspended and uh, I don't know. They come to, they dropped. What do they do? I wonder the wonder that if they remove those parts, you know, because they do hysterectomy. Some women when they have disease, I wonder if they do that when a man, when a man transitions from a woman. Yeah. When a man transitions from a woman. Yeah. When you used to be a woman and now you're going to the dude. Yeah. What do they do? I just can't wait til the day where they can do it genetically. Where a woman really becomes a woman, like a man becomes a woman or a woman becomes a man. But guess what? Even if they do, here's the issue. If you knew that a woman took steroids for 30 years and developed insane tendon strength and muscle strength and then stop doing steroids, it is a scientific fact that you are going to keep a very big percentage of those gains.

Speaker 2:          00:34:13       What are the game? What is the percentage at 30% or 40% whatever the fuck it is, whatever percentage that you would keep after you get off the steroids, that is significant. And even if you're not currently on these performance enhancing drugs, your body has been artificially boosted to this superior level through these drugs. Yeah. And you lose a lot of the feminine. Again, you lose the breasts. It does. Might not come back. Well, I mean, I think if you take estrogen, they'll probably call me. I don't know how to fucking doctor. I'm a moron. But what I do know is when this is, we're in nonsense land. Yeah. Okay. It's not, is it not saying that someone can't become a woman and be a woman and I'll talk, I'll call them a woman. I'll treat them like a woman. I'm cool with it and I'm 100% cool with it.

Speaker 2:          00:34:57       I'm in is open minded is I come with this. But this is, this is unfair for women, which is what's so ironic about this, cause everyone's supposed to be looking out for women. If you're looking out for women, but you're also blindly progressive to the point where you let and shit like this fly, well then now you're not looking out for women. Right. Because now women are in this weird position where you're putting them there at an unfair disadvantage. Right. It's fucking crazy. I agree. God Damn. It makes me want to drink real Heineken. I'm getting B on this devil's here. No, they just sent the stuff to me. It's good. Yeah. Um, I used to love Heineken light. I talk about that subject a little bit too much, but it's just, it's a symptom of a sick society. It's a symptom of a lack of rational thinking to symptom that people just, just being bending over backwards so hard to be progressive and open minded that you're just, you're giving into these extremists, these crazy people that are looking at this thing completely delusional.

Speaker 2:          00:35:57       Lee, when will it snap back? I mean, it's common to Trump. That's why Trump's present. What that is, he's gonna win again. He's going to win again. Other who can meet him. They're not going to beat it. There's no one who can write. He's gonna win again. He's gonna win again because the shit like this. The more shit like this happens. There's then what's after chunk? There's another four years, son Donald Jr Donald J Donald Jr was a, with a, a friend of a friend of mine. Uh, his name is crispy and he, he's a disabled veteran or he's very able, I should say. Yeah, but he's a wounded veteran. He's, he was missing, he had his leg amputated, Burns over most of his body. Super positive attitude. Great Guy. Anyways, he doesn't get political online. He took a picture with Donald Trump jr right. And Instagram took it down for violating their terms of service.

Speaker 2:          00:36:45       It's just a photo picture of just photo with hesitant son photo with him at Trump jr just standing there and they took the picture down. What that, what are you doing? Yeah, maybe this a, did they ever, when they do that that it gives you a reason or they just do what they want? Well he posted it on his, he sent me a direct message about it too. I asked, I actually reached out to him because a, I follow him and he follows me and I was like, does this shit real? And he's like, Yup. And he's super positive about it. I mean, this is a guy who served our country too and he's know he's a great guy. Like his, his, his, his, his uh, Instagram handle is crispy 11 B. Okay. Yeah. And he just put it up there and they said that they got him for terms of service and they took it down and he put it back up again. Good. Good for him. So this is the photo right here.

Speaker 3:          00:37:37       Let me see when the acid Instagram says that they didn't do it, didn't do it, but who took it down that said, however, an Instagram spoke first and told Fox News. The post was reviewed but was not deleted by the company after I found the post did not violate their standards. But that's not true because it's missing spokesperson said it. There are a number of reasons. A post may no longer be available, including the account holder deletes either the account or the post it cut it. And he's saying he didn't do that. So it could have been something else.

Speaker 2:          00:38:01       Mm. I mean, you can't prove it and I don't know. Well did this dude is not an attention whore and he wouldn't do that. He wouldn't do that in lie about it. That's ridiculous. I mean, Twitter, Instagram can be lying and they, and they just never really could be a glitch too. Yeah. You know, sometimes it's a fortuitous glitch that looks like a massive conspiracy. Yeah. But he said they'd send them notice it said it violated the terms of services. So if he said that he, he's okay. Yeah. That's what was said back to, I'm pretty sure that's the screenshot you want to make sure that says you violated something. Yeah, that's what you want. I mean, it's just so weird what's going on now. This is, it's, everything just seemed so fucking preposterous. Yeah. Just like on Facebook, Twitter, all that stuff. If I get, if it's something negative, I just, you know, that's gone.

Speaker 2:          00:38:50       I don't, I don't let, I don't let people just start bashing me on that stuff. I just, okay. Here it is. Once I landed, I opened up Instagram and got a message that your post was taken down for violating Instagram guidelines. So did he poke post that? Yes, he did. Oh, there you go. Wait a minute. Let me see the dude. Yeah. He posted a thing, sang it. Okay. Here's what he posted. It said, wounded veteran violated community standards by posting with Donald Trump jr he didn't post the actual notification, but he probably didn't even save it. Right. [inaudible] I believe him. I believe him. I just somebody, you're right. It is a sad, I think you also have overzealous employees. I think there's that too. Yeah, I think there's a huge company. Yeah. I mean anybody can go and get a minute and just do what the what the what the, what do they want?

Speaker 2:          00:39:39       You think they're reading Dick pics and it's been fucking with them on the other way. The other way around. Someone could have just flagged it by a bunch of bots. It's just made it disappear. Oh right. To get a reaction like this. Yeah. That's all. It could be simple as that. Can you do that? Sure. So if you just had a bought the jewelry, I can do it right now on Instagram. Review it manually before they delete it. No, cause I can just be taken down. It happens on other accounts for that doesn't get reviewed that way and it just got taken down because it got flagged to so many times. I don't know. Well that's one thing that we did learn from talking to what Jack Dorsey, the CEO of Twitter, like it's impossible to manage. There's too many posts. They're going up right now by the thousands. Like if you could see everyone, everyone in America posting on Twitter right now and be like, oh yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:40:28       I mean, imagine if you all have supernova explosion of ones and Zeros. Just fun all over the place and texts. Just chat. Who Do you think like if he would've grabbed somebody phone, the most popular person that gets tweeted the most. Just looked at it. Yeah. How fast would that go? You know what I mean? Like just that, that one account. Oh, be insane. Oh, years probably goes to people or do you just, yeah, full still out of the people. I follow a lot of other people. I just followed whenever, whenever things, someone's interesting, so he's got cool pictures. A fall guy. Yeah. Yeah. I just hit like first. Yeah. Well let me see. What else does person's nature. They're not whack. What's really funny is people get mad at you for certain people. You follow people that you stopped following r Kelly. Now don't tell them what to do.

Speaker 2:          00:41:21       Right. That's first of all, first of all, don't tell me what to do. Second of all, what am I doing? Am I boosting up his profile? He's fucking art Kelly. No, it doesn't matter if I follow them. If I don't, I want to know how crazy he is. That's right, dude. Did you see Tyron, Tyron Woodley, UFC, a top welterweight former champion had a thing on his Instagram page of him watching our Kelly getting interviewed and where he was. He was. Who was denying that he knows how to hog tie people laughing at him. Play this, play this here, all in this interview. This is crazy. Shit ain't funny, but hole I sent me paypal hall.

Speaker 2:          00:42:23       That's great. He's not using confidence tonight. He's like, Hahaha. To haul. How? Hey, I follow r Kelly for the same reasons that I love real talk. Do you ever watch the video? Real talk? We played it on the podcast multiple times. Real talk is one of the greatest unintentional comedies that's ever been real talk, real talk and seen it. Oh my God. What is it? It's a r Kelly song. Okay. Where he's in an argument with his girlfriend on the phone while he was with his girlfriend on the phone. He's like getting his hair done and shit. He's smoking stone, he's drinking. It's got like different outfits on and he's still in the conversation and there's one part where he goes, bitch, I wish you would fucking clothes. Real talk bitch. I wish you would burn my motherfucking clothes real serious about that. Listen, I absolutely feel for any person that he's victimized you got, but you cannot deny that. That shit is fun. Hilarious. That shit is fun. I'm sorry. There is. Hold on. I just play that triflin ass.

Speaker 2:          00:43:41       Flynn is the best, best African American single malt. Trifle Triflin Triflin and it's one that white people cannot use. It's too, I pronounced it too good. They on that word. Hang on that word as much as they own the n word. Right. Top trifle link. You can't be trifling. You can't. You can't be announced the g and track the link. Yeah, you Katelyn. Yeah. That's why. Why people were not allowed to use it. They would ruin it. Exactly. He's out there trifling stuff. They're trifling. Shit. He's just a bullshit hint. Trifling ass trifling. Here's the thing, I bet gay guys use trifling. Getting guys will pull it out out with him over there, but this trifling ass. I know. It sounds like a rifle that you travel with. That's a trifle it. Yeah, like a triathlon. This I travel rifle. The thing that abandoning those good for long range, they'll bring a trifle with. How many people do you think had to look it up before Webster had to like answer this question. What does a trifling Heifer definition laugh, lacking insignificance or solid worth such as a frivolous, trifling. Be Trivial. A trifling gift. See chiefly dialectical, my God. Lazy shift list in a trifling fellow. Trifling fell.

Hello? Yeah, that's a word bro. That's a, that's a legit word. Trifling Shit. I was going to say something else. I totally forgot. What did we talk about right before two of them are Kelly Kelly. I liked that point. He did an album where it was a lot of just talking. Oh, trapped in the closet. Yeah. There was a whole series. I think Aziz had a whole thing on that. I think he did like Aziz Ansari did a bit on it. I believe so. I know he had a bit. Yeah, about r Kelly. It might've been about trapped in the closet trap. The closet is great but it can't fuck with real talk. Real talk to you. The Jam.

Speaker 2:          00:45:41       Have you seen at a shocker weird Al Yankovic trapped at a drive through? No, it's really good. It's the same length as our Kelly's trapped in the closet and it's the same and it's all about being trapped at a Mcdonald's drive through because the person in front of is taking too long and it's like the fact that he did the whole song is this one respect commitment. I made it too. It's the whole cart animated. Oh my God. That's hilarious. Which one is this weird? Al has been around for a long time, man. I mean I remember when Michael Jackson's beat it came out and he had eat it. Eat it. Yeah, I'm I it was, I'm fat. That's gotta to be, it's gotta be late eighties early. Not yet. It is late eight is real APP real. How old is here? Weird. Al's gotta be 85 years old.

Speaker 2:          00:46:40       59 12. His first song aired in 1976. He was big on Dr Demento. That's insane. So he was really young. Dr Demento Demento I never listen to it as a kid, but that's uh, they played all of these weird goofball, nerdy songs. Yeah. And he was the king of it. He has a huge following now. He's like, he'll, he'll sell out places. Weirdo. Yeah, that makes sense. Yeah. Well, he's got so much neurodegeneration. Giant body of work. Yeah. I like his hair too. He's got the hammer. He's a super nice guy too. Yeah. And smart. I've heard. Yeah, but everyone's smart. What else can we say? Yeah. He's a good dancer too. And accepts his gender. He's not trifling. That's one. That's definitely not true. Yeah. That's a word. It's like there's certain words like that one you just seemed so ridiculous if you try to use it.

Speaker 2:          00:47:39       Oh, this is what I was going to say. Yeah. We were talking about, uh, uh, we weren't even talking about this, but my daughter is watching these youtube videos of this. There's this young gay fellow that does makeup tutorials. Oh yeah. Okay. He's enormous. He's enormous. You know, he, he, he probably gets more views than any network show that's ever been created. How old was this fellow? He's young, so he's like 20. Oh, okay. What do you say, Jamie? If I should bring this up. I just put the last thing that popped in my head during Coachella, he got accused of being in this viral video that happened. It said it wasn't him, but there's did the Ferris wheel Coachella. Have you ever seen that dude I'm talking about, no. It's a big famous thing that people take pictures in front of. Uh, during a concert you could see a silhouette of somebody getting head in there and it's two guys.

Speaker 2:          00:48:33       Oh, it's a very vivid video that was going, went super viral on Twitter that night. And they were saying it was him. How dare they, he's all about makeup, not head sons of bitches. We imply your lift ticket, keep it clean. But it's hilarious. My, my sister, my sister, my daughter sits in front of the TV cackling watching it just as it's supposed to be funny. She thinks it's funny. She thinks he's hilarious going for laughter. Well, I don't know. Yeah. I mean he's covered in crazy makeup. I think what she was laughing at though, in all fairness was he was making fun of someone subscriber 6 million, 16 million, all black. I think he was making fun of people that put on too much makeup. Okay. So he was going crazy with, she thought it was really funny. That is fucking banana. 16 million people and he's doing makeup tutorials.

Speaker 2:          00:49:26       He looks great. He looks great. That's the thing. It's like we, there's an all credential kinds of shit like this that you would have never expected. Yeah. And because of the access, because on demand access, especially like through computer, it's so easy. It's so easy. Just type in the next thing, but just what's next just pops up. Yeah. So like these people that no network in their right mind, like NBC would never say, Hey that young guy, let's get that guy to do a makeup, show the blood, get the fuck out of the office. You don't know shit about ratings. Meanwhile, 8 billion subscribers. That's crazy. That'd be a fun game to play is like what rabbit hole would youtube send you down if you typed in this? I just let it keep going. That's upon its own. Those algorithms, they, the real problem is people think that a lot of those algorithms are essentially designed to get you angry. Oh you pissed off. So he wants the next thing take. Yeah, our our children. What are

Speaker 1:          00:50:28       they teaching our children next? This is the problem with illegal immigration. I knew there's a fucking problem and you know, and then next thing you know, you just more and more angry. That's like the argument with Facebook too is that they're trying to figure out what gets people to engage. And so the algorithm realize what you engage with and then that's what they show you more of. And what gets people to engage is shit that makes them mad. Yeah. Yeah. It keeps me wanting to, I want you to fight videos on Facebook all day. Derail and do well. Just like, you know, like brawls in the school yard or like, you know, just, it just keeps going. I'm like, Oh man, what's going to happen here? It's, but yeah. Well, you know, I'm not, I don't do much of the fighting, so when I see it, it's like, oh, this is interesting.

Speaker 1:          00:51:17       Who's going to win this one? And the ACA when the, you know, with the, the underdog. Yeah. I enjoy watching it. Yeah. I mean, I will watch them. I watch it to talk. It's obviously someone's about to die. Right. That like her a couple punches to the face. Well, the best ones are when someone deserves it. Yes. So those are the ones you enjoy. Someone's being a real dick. Yeah. Someone's like, listen man, you're being a dick. Yeah. I just saw one. There's a guy on a, it was a, I want to say it like an old Middle Eastern couple that are on a subway. And this dude's like smacking his wife in the face like that and there's this other guys he's across from him and he's recording it and he's like, no, not not in front of me. And he walked over there and say, he told him like eight times to stop and then just a punching the shit out of him.

Speaker 1:          00:52:01       So it's nice to see that. You know, that is, yeah. There's one, uh, of a guy that uh, Kinda, it's like a bus and some guys running his mouth to this old white guy who's obviously a like a x Vietnam vet and he's telling him like, just leave it alone, then leave it alone. And he comes down in there and then he walks up to the front and he just beats the shit out of him and, and, and you just see blood coming out of his face and it's like, you know, he started this, he engaged that whole thing. The guy was walking away and then he goes back up to ones. Yeah, those are the best ones. Yeah. When someone deserves it. Yeah. How many, like that's the thing about like a guy smacking his wife in public. Yeah. Like how often does he smack her that he's so confident that he'll just smack her and say to everybody, right.

Speaker 1:          00:52:49       Like it's, it must be, he must think it's acceptable and everyone else was cool with it. Know, I must think that he could just get away with things. Yeah. Sometimes people just think they can get away with things. Yeah. It was a, there was not many people on that bus in this video. I wasn't even paying attention to him or that. Most people just going to be too scared to say anything. Yeah. That's what I mean. Death. This is where it gets real scary because that is the best argument for the end of all privacy is that no one would ever be able to do anything like that because the whole world will be watching. Yeah, exactly. Honest like you, you

Speaker 2:          00:53:26       might, it depends on what kind of action you could take. Yeah. If you could literally see everything that's happening at any time, everywhere in the world. Ah, yeah. We'll not, everyone's got cam. So it's like it's close. It's close. Yeah. Right. And then they're gonna have those fucking foldable things. Cops on us. You're keeping the people on. It's now a little bit until too much alcohol's involved. That was something to it because if you think about La, like Kennedy did a speech on secrecy. It was like in 1961 or 62 about how apporach secrecy is, how dangerous it is for a free society. And uh, they're basically talking about secret societies and secret, you know, packs and the government. And he was basically, I think a lot of it was him talking about some of the shady shit that he experienced and intelligence agencies and Oh, but when you have like kings or when you have people that are in power, like how do they wield that power?

Speaker 2:          00:54:24       One of the ways they will their pie. It's all secrecy. If they want to execute people and then I kill people with, it's all secret. No one, the world is not privy to it. Like what happened to them? They, they took him to a bunker somewhere and they're beating the shit out of him. Torturing them. Like North Korea. Yeah, exactly. They're just isolated from the rest of the world and who knows what the hell he's doing over there. So if we just know the stuff that he allows us to know. Yeah. No, that's the perfect example of power and secrecy, right? Yeah. Like do they just take you and make you disappear that he's executed a bunch of people? Oh yeah. The, we don't even know. I'm sure that over close to the tip of the iceberg on that, I'm sure that still goes on here too.

Speaker 2:          00:55:03       Oh yeah. I'm sure. I'm sure people are killing people for someone right now. You know? And some of them deserve it. Yeah. Give him an extra one for me. Right. Stopping a triathlon. It's, it's also weird like what we'll accept people dying from like a, I was listening to his podcast where a, this wolf lady, she's a wolf biologist who was talking to my friend Steve Rinella on the mediator podcast and she was talking about how we accept people getting killed by mountain lions. Yeah. Like it's, it happens tapping twice last year. Right. It happens. It's not, it's not really common, but it happens. But the moment that people start getting killed by wolves in America, people are going to get furious. Really? Yeah. Cause when they reintroduced wolves all the 1994 that's right. Also that, so that's a, they're outraged that we did that too. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:55:56       Well she was basically, they were sent, it was, there was two really interesting things about the podcast, have a lot of really interesting things, but two that really stood out was one that the, these people, they reintroduced these animals in 1994 but there were already some wolves here and the wolves would have probably eventually made it down there. Was in Yellowstone, right? Yeah, yeah, yeah. But that we aren't w because the fact that they brought him in and it wasn't just a natural, oh, we have this thing like, oh, so many ruined this. Somebody fucked this up. Yeah. And the other thing is that they number them instead of name them. Because if you name them, it's like there's Delores, Delores killed some sheep, we're going to have to take her out and wow, we can't kill the Doris, but a number three wolf one five, seven, right?

Speaker 2:          00:56:42       Yeah. Yeah, that's true. That's like inmates in prison. You just give him numbers. Exactly. It's easier to kill him. Easier to treat them like cattle. Right. So, but we did the one guy killed that mountain land. He fought back. Yeah. That story turned out to be horse shit. I sat right. Yeah. That the male lion was one kid who was a real kitten and had been separated from its mom. I think his mom got killed. It was really, really small and really young. So it wasn't like, I mean, he might attack, who knows? Yeah. Well he's, yeah, he's a bitch. I don't know if he's listening right now. I'm sorry bro. But I think what happened, you were alive and were happy to live. You better not touch wolves, buddy. I think it maybe it was starving to death and it took a chance to try to kill him.

Speaker 2:          00:57:28       Yeah, that's possible too. But it was really small. It's like 30 pounds, which still a 30 pound cat. It's fucking terrified. I'd never saw pictures of the cat. No, I never saw it either because something had ate a lot of it by the time. Well, okay. Yeah. So did he say how he did it? Did he put it in like a choke hold or did he choked it? Oh, right. Stepped on it. Something like that. I don't man. Yeah. Can I ask you if you saw this thing going around the Internet, about this wolf pack being tracked or the, it's actually six of my shit. It's like a moving gif over time, but oh yeah. I have seen this. It's amazing. It shows how they never cross territory's. Oh, cool. Six different packs, I would think. Yeah. They all established their territory. They mark their territory and they respect.

Speaker 2:          00:58:11       They'll respect it. Yeah. It's like over Minnesota. Minnesota has a shitload of wolves apparently. If it keeps going and it's a picture of Jimi Hendrix. Wisconsin has a shit, right? If you pull back further. Yeah. Wisconsin is a shit load of wolves apparently like thousands. Yeah. Yeah. I could see that and it's a lot of no woods up there and just land. Not, not many major cities. I freak out saw once, I think I saw a wolf ones, but it was like in the wild. Yeah, it was big. It was a either a coyote or was a wolf with a thing. Might've been a wolf because it was a just getting dusk and I was in Alberta and I saw this thing run across the road. I was like, damn, might've been a wolf. Yeah, but if you see a wolf, that's the spooky thing is what do they do when they circling you? Yeah, the checking you out and they're not usually a long right. Those are the lone wolf, but that's rare. That's an asshole. He's a guy. Get kicked out. You ever seen this video? This one's great. Look at the sides of this thing. Comes out of the woods, walks across the street. Look at this. Jesus. That's a bear. That's such a big wolf. That's a bear.

Speaker 1:          00:59:22       No, that's a wonder what that is. That it's a big ass wolf. That's what that is. That's probably 130 pound wolf or something. Where is this? If I had a guest does this Canada, Russia. It's gotta be Russia. That's a gigantic wolf rushes head. Real legitimate problems with wolves were in Siberia. They have these super pacs. They would get together like, cause they were starving so you get like a hundred wolves would form a super pac because they could kind of do whatever the fuck they want and once they get that bang and they started killing horses. Yeah, go on a horse stables to just tick down a horse. Easy. Yeah. But it's just the idea that the super pacs and that they realized it was too hard to, to just take over shit. All these pesky people and their guns and houses and that's, they get desperate.

Speaker 1:          01:00:12       Your fucking horses now. Siberia has always been an interesting place in Russia. No. Have you used to do up there? 1990. Yeah. Uh, right before communism fell. I was there for three weeks. Well before communism fell. Yeah, we do a bunch off. Was a empower. Whoa. Yeah. Uh, it was a spy preview of the CAG deal. You'll get pulling in my visual style. Wow. That's pretty good. What'd you say? I said hello? Uh, I don't understand please and thank you that it's the worst. I remember, uh, it was just program founded by Dwight d Eisenhower and that four days of the, it's called people to people where the, they send the youth of America to other countries to hang out with that youth to promote world pace. And that's all it is. And certain kids from high schools are selected and they go, you got to Washington DC first for three, for three days.

Speaker 1:          01:01:02       They, they, they debrief you and then you go to another country and ours was Russia. It was awesome. Had to add a great time. Wow. Yeah. And uh, I told Bert Kreischer that too, you know, cause he has the whole machine story. I said, I feel like I can't tell my Russian story because you've, you've owned it so much with your machines going and if I do anything about this, then it's going to look like I'll, I'll get you too, huh? Yeah. You got it in Russia story to you should tell it. Yeah. People want to hear it. They'll understand it. They don't think you're, I kind of got in trouble because I was trading illegally on the black market over there. Well, we did it on purpose. I didn't know I was doing it. Um, because you know, it's both for the story, right. Because a cop and like tell me more.

Speaker 1:          01:01:42       That's kind of what happened. This dude I was talking to is after like a, a function that we were at, you know, with a, we will go to the, some, some towns, some village, and they'd come in, they'd greet you with bread and salt and they would dance around and you would just eat with them and hang out or whatever. And, um, so I was just talking to this kid, you know, and they speak perfect English, you know, we're the ones that don't speak Russian. So this kid is trying to teach me Russian cuffs words and I thought he's pretty cool. It's before the Internet, you know. So I had a bunch of these ain't pans that my mom gave me from the phone company where she works. She goes, just give him make pants, they live anything with English riding on it, anything American, they're going to love it.

Speaker 1:          01:02:16       Bubble gum, jeans, ink, pens, Solo. I was like, yeah, it let's, let's be pen pals. So exchanging addresses, you know, like I would keep in touch with you, why not? And I gave him a pen and he gives me his address. And what I don't know is this dude's already kind of in trouble with cops over there for trading illegally on the black market. I had no idea. And this cop just grabbed both of us, the drags us into the hotel and no one saw me from my group get grabbed by the way, because I was off doing my own little thing that this dude, right, uh, learning Russian customers. So we'll go into his office and this hotel and they're just cussing each other in Russian. And I don't know what the hell is going on. I'm like, dude, what is this? Am I a big trouble here?

Speaker 1:          01:02:55       I mean, you know, he goes, if this bullshit not to learn about that, this is bullshit. Then they scream some more. Now the cop doesn't speak English. And so he's basically my translator disguise to the cop. I'm like, Hey man, I'm with this group, you know, I don't know what's going on. And so he kicks that kid out, the Russian cop, and now it's just me and this Russian cop. And I'm looking at him and, and he's looking at me and he looks at my bag with all these ink pens and he's like, he goes like this. He's like, what was, you know, let me see. You know, he'll call you want to pin. So I hand him a pen and he looks at it. Is that good? Cool. He puts it in his desk and he goes away and it comes back with this big ass Russian PennDOT sickle and hammer thing with wings coming out.

Speaker 1:          01:03:33       It's pretty cool looking thing. And he's handed it to me and he goes like this. So he technically arrested me for trading and then he traded with me. Yeah, 1990s. When that happened, it was pretty crazy. It was fun to see all that shit though, right before it fell. And did you see like lines in the street for food or anything crazy like that? Yeah, I'm not crazy. Well, yeah, we, I saw linens. Uh, we went to red scare of square Lenin's tomb. Um, we went to some smaller little danky villages. Uh, went swimming in the Nepa to river, right close to where Chernobyl was like 50 miles from Chernobyl and whoa. So, um, but yeah, there was definitely tell it was definitely some poverty going on here and there, but not, not to the extreme that you hear. You're not, I didn't see like these lines around buildings or for toilet paper or anything like that.

Speaker 1:          01:04:25       But you know, that's what I was, communism was on its way out too, so it wasn't in the worst part of it, but it was definitely an experience. I was 18 when I went over there. There's a picture of me in red square and w I got acid washed jeans. I've got a bugle boy t shirt on and I'm wearing a fanny pack with deck shoes and I'm just doing like that. So that was fun, man. Yeah, that's gotta be a hell of a flight too. Right? How long does it take to get the ride? We went to Germany first on a layover there for like three hours, Frankfurt and then to house so young. I couldn't even tell you how long that thing was. It's been a long time. 47 now. That is an interesting country to me. It's always been an interesting country because it gets so fucking cold. They're hard people and they create all these amazing fighters. There's so many great fighters and wrestle and wrestlers that

Speaker 2:          01:05:18       have come out of Russia. Former Soviet Union that can drag off rocky five or four. Yeah, the new one. It was scary to new ones. She was afraid of the new creed. Rocky's. Yeah. You know that I've heard. I haven't seen it yet. Yeah. Dragos son is fighting. Who is this guy? Creed's son till we know the actor. The creed guy? No, no. Think this is the son of a Drago. I Dunno. Some Russian cat. Okay. Already famous over here. I like to think so. I don't think so. Yeah. There's the guy. Look at him. There's the real cool. Yeah. He his son. My sauce. Like a bad ass. He does. He's still a bad ass. I'm sure that his jaw was perfectly square. That was like a dam square cut. Much bigger Rocky's right. How tall is a Sylvester? I don't know. I maybe met him.

Speaker 2:          01:06:14       Yes. Yes. Um, I think he's about five [inaudible] nine. He's taller than me. I'm five. Eight. Okay. So he's either five, nine or five. 10. Okay. So that hold the drug up must be huge. Like how it tells you to say he is, cause everybody was jokes around and says he's five [inaudible] 11 or a these five, seven, five, five. But they do that with everybody. Yeah, they do that. Tom Cruise, his five 10 see that makes sense. So He's two inches taller than me. Five 10. Okay. Well yeah, I think I'm five nine. I don't know. I haven't measured myself in a while. Hello? Hello. How tall do you think I am? I think you're about that. About five. Nine. Yeah. In high school I always put like five, 10, five, 11 you'd get more bigger. Now. We're old people that are small and as people get bigger and bigger, these kids today that are getting hitting puberty when there's six yeah, there's hormones in the meat.

Speaker 2:          01:07:06       What's up? Six five, six, five. They probably accentuated his height for that. That single, that's just his hair's five inches. Look at that damn hair. It looks like he's almost like a foot taller than them, doesn't it? Yeah. Yeah. They probably had, they probably had him in heels and barefoot or something for that shot. Didn't they say like, uh, at one point there in this movie, Rocky said, go ahead and uh, go ahead. Hit me for real one time. Just what, you know, so make it look real because they were always like, you know, they're like an inch apart and the swings and it almost hit him to the hospital. Like he hit him in the chest. Right? Yeah, he talked about that. Almost stopped his heart. Dumb idea. Doll from Jews. Right. He's a professional. He's a kickbox kickboxing. Yeah. Really good. So that's the song Lundgren put me in the hospital during rocky four.

Speaker 2:          01:07:54       Yeah. Yeah. Believe it. Don't let people hit you bro. You know, he, he also liked to realism bell, I guess. I wonder if they even use the clip. Right. Um, he also has like screws in his neck from doing the expendables. I'll, yeah. Yeah. What do you got you, he's put in intensive care for five days of that with nuns walking around. Jesus Christ. Wow. Insurance Company would not pay out until after they saw the footage of the incident. Once they did, they wrote the check. I want to see that footage. He said he could see that punch. He hit my heart so hard that it banged against my ribs and started to swell. And that usually happens in car accidents. Oh my God. That guy can punch. He's a beast, man. He's a giant dude. Why would he ever needs a serious striker? Like he knows how to throw shots. If you watch him in his movies, he's uh, he's obviously trained. Yeah, I want to see that footage. I want to say that punk, ouch. It's gotta be out there. But if Sylvester Stallone wouldn't let anybody see it that way because it was too embarrassing, the way cried.

Speaker 4:          01:09:07       Ooh.

Speaker 2:          01:09:08       He's like that lady who steps on Grapes and falls down.

Speaker 4:          01:09:11       Oh Wow.

Speaker 2:          01:09:13       She loses her breath. You can never be an action hero again. If somebody sees you cry. That's true. Right? If someone sees Z, like legitimately cry from a liver shot, whoa. He just shit yourself and he's looking at the camera. Why shitting yourself is probably the most embarrassing thing a person do, right? Yeah. You share like a guy who's known for being handsome and Debonair and a bad ass can't make it to the toilet anti black. There's no control over and shoot yourself in your car while you're driving. You know, white leather seats. That's the worst it's going to happen to sell. It happens to everybody. It's going to be a time in your life if you eat risky. Yeah. Right? Yeah. Think of the most handsome person in the world. Most often the woman in the world splattering all over herself at some point and her hotness hay day, most likely.

Speaker 2:          01:10:04       Do you remember that? Like thinking about that, what was the Woody Harrelson movie? Was it w? W that was, he was throwing up it. Was it woody Harrelson movie where he played the Bowler? Oh yeah. I'll a kingpin tink pen. Yeah. That was a scene, right? There wasn't a shit seat in that. That was, I'm thinking of dumb and dumber. There is a shit seen it. Well, he's sitting in the urinal. That's about it. Really? Oh yeah, that's right. That's right. I know how to do it because I had a fairly brothers movie. Dumb and dumber as big shit scene too with uh, Jeff Daniels. That's right. That's what I'm thinking. It's laxative in his, where he's hanging onto the toilet lid. Like he's going to get shocked to orbit and he's going, oh yeah. They got all these weird noises. Yeah. Because Jim Carrey was tail ceilings girl.

Speaker 2:          01:10:50       Yeah. Yeah. Always poisoned his friend. Yeah, that's it right there. There it is full on. But kingpin, was it a fairly brothers movie? That's, um, that's one of my all time favorite comedy movies came paint. That's a great guy. It's great. I remember loving it, but I haven't seen it in so long. I need to get looked at it. Looked at it against, scared to watch movies that I love again and see him in like the light of 2019 and go, yeah, this is terrible. I know that's happened a couple of times. It happens. It's weird, right? Yeah. You remembered so fondly. Yeah. Look at that. Bilberry think that hair hair's amazing. It was such a good movie with hair and makeup had to go like, I'm sure that was his decision. We're going to make your hair just fan out randomly up. It's going to look like a spoiler on a fee era before Donald Trump.

Speaker 2:          01:11:44       Yeah, yeah. Like a little Trump thing going on there. It's very similar. So as a professional bowler now and a Pba that has a full on orange Afro right now. Really? And he's like really good and he's from my hometown. Yeah. See if you're a bowl or you got to do something like that. Stand out where like purple glittery clothes or some shit. That's smart. That's just Brandon. He's peacock and he's like there is that dude's from Hickory, North Carolina. So he, that's why he wears that shit. Got Him. Well he's gets up to Scott too. I mean, how the fuck else do you get attention when Europe Bowler? Exactly. Like that might be the only way to save Boeing. They might have to like go like roller derby and just knock into each other when a boat trailer board a bowling. I've never sat down and watched bowling.

Speaker 2:          01:12:31       Ari's, he's got a good friend, Tommy, what's his name? He's a professional bowler. Real Nice Guy. I met him at a couple of shows. Okay. But this guy's a real pro bowler and we were talking about like the financial opportunities of bowling and this is not good like pro pool players on both. Surprised. It sucks. It sucks. Tommy Ari's friend. I'm sorry. Have you boldly? Recently I bought with my kids as five bold. Yeah. Dilutes maybe. I think that's it. Yeah. Tommy glutes. I think that's it. Got, what's your high school with was a, Yup. That's him. Did turn a hundred percent there's already or you went to see him bowl? Yeah. He's a good guy. Real fucking killer borrower. Do you, can you make it curve? No. Yeah. He even tried to enroll that motherfucker to ride down the damn middle. I do it as hard as possible or it's disturbing for people to watch and now they have it.

Speaker 2:          01:13:33       They have the miles per hour up there so you can see how fast, it's like a dam, you know, like a pitching thing. I'm trying to get that bitch fast. Yeah, I just want to smash those things. I can't, I know he get the guys who like curve it really good. Like he goes way over here and it just whips real fast and then a gutter ball. Oh all that for fucking Beth. The fucked up. Look at all that you did shitty with watch. Now Watch me ride down the middle. Strack to me bowling was always like breaking in Pool. It's like yeah it's cool to break the balls. But the real cool thing is to play the game. Like this is you just breaking the balls over over again. It's the same look every time. Every time. Well it's like bowling, bowling, you're just breaking the balls.

Speaker 2:          01:14:18       That's all you're doing. Like when you're bowling, you got pins, you just knocking down the pins, the exact same more. It's the same thing every time. And I know the combinations are different in the way they collide and the way you impact is different. But it's still the same thing. Like it's a dumb game. Sorry. And my grandfather was a big bowler Mac and bold leagues and he had trophies in his house and Shit. He used to love bowling, but I was like a little kid. I was analyzing Boeing cause he'd take me bowling with them. I was like, this isn't a nonsense game. Yeah, it's games nonsense to get into it just so you can smoke and drink and there's a thing that they have in the east coast in Boston that they don't even have anywhere else. It's called candle pin bowling. He ever see that shit.

Speaker 2:          01:15:01       It's which smaller version do you your ball with a softball. That sounds more fun to me, but it's huge in the east coast. Hometown, Ohio. They've got a few places actually. The gigantic bars that they have all these lanes for this thing? Yeah, for candle pin bowling. Yeah. It's called pens or something like that. Yeah, I was looking down on that because I came from my grandfather in New Jersey. I bold regular bowling, like a fucking American. Right. And then I go over what's this candle pit bull shit. What'd you guys steal this from Finland or something. But is that nonsense pins, all of those things. See, I didn't notice that. That is ridiculous. I didn't know they were shaped that way. Throwing rocks to thrown rocks had pins. That's not what I was talking about. This is really just the bar that hard. This is not what you're talking about.

Speaker 2:          01:15:42       Just, well I mean it is but it's it's way smaller and it's really just like a bar game. Oh No, this has like five lanes or 10 lanes and he could play but but it's the same game and see bowling in New England, they'll have like bowling alleys and you'd go, Oh let's go bowl. And they're like, Oh we're candle pin only people like what? Candled pin only bowling alleys. Yeah, so we're going to light these candles. That's what I want. Set them on fire. It only works on the east coast for some reason. There's a few of those things like how about this high lie? I'll fuck people can't go fault. That ball goes fast. It's actually it's way smaller. And I was thinking in my head, I'm like miniature bowling. You got a little ball to just keep ball a little bit. Yeah, so it's Kinda like candle pin bowling, but the candle pins, the pins are different.

Speaker 2:          01:16:30       The shape, like candles, that's why it's called candle pin bowling. If you look at them, they're thin pins and they're not like fat on the bottom. That's like what? Why are we even here? We bolded or not make a commitment. Highlight I think is one of the most corrupt games. Oh yeah. Someone, someone tried to tell me explain, oh, it was Joey. He was explaining to me how highlight works that it's all about gambling and the only reason why it works is that people are betting on the games and so because people are betting on the games, they get these guys and these guys just fucking miss it on purpose and they knew. Yeah. It's like it's rigged. I might be wrong. If you're a highlight player and you're like, is this podcast, hey, I get my information from the Church of what's happening here.

Speaker 2:          01:17:11       We go, look at that damn glove. It's, look how they play with that. It looks like somebody with a one long freaking nail or they they're holding it right. It's not like wrapped around their wrist. They're holding it like a tennis racket. How much more fun would it be if he watched a baseball game with a picture? Just had that thing. Boy, that looks so stupid. This game looks so, Doug, what's the goal? The goal was losing, I don't know, throwing it off the wall and then another guy catches it and then throw it in, but they somebody here to get hit in the face pretty quick. They're putting forth minimum efforts. Even when he falls down, it's like that guy, he's fallen down like he's trying to get a foul like, oh yeah, he does. It looks like he flopped Flint soccer. The soccer flops.

Speaker 2:          01:17:55       Oh, he soccer flopped it. That's why Soco never make it in America. The flop you can't get. Yeah, you have 30 years of flopping. You can't trick us. We can watch it on TV. We know what you do. You know though, I think it's catching on in the NFL and the NBA, they're starting to flop a little bit more because they see what happened. They didn't. Somebody analyze who's free throw to the analyze. What do you mean? There was someone that Angela, there was an ESPN analyst who analyzed, um, what's the guy's name with a big crazy beard. Really good basketball player. Oh, from the clippers. Hope go to, I don't know what I pretended. I literally don't know shit. Go To uh, Andrew Salt Schultz is, I think it's Kevin Durant. Is that it? Andrew Salt Schultz's go to Andrew souls. Schultes is a Twitter page, so he had it up on his Twitter and I washed it and I've watched it analysis the difference between him when he's challenged and he throws a free throw versus unchallenged when he's uncharted with the beard.

Speaker 2:          01:18:56       That's James Harden. Okay. We've been challenged, meaning someone's trying to block him or he has a free open cup of Chai and he has a free open shot. He just jumps up in the air and does this three is three pointer. But when he's challenged, he throws his legs up to hit the other person so he could fall down on his ass. I don't like it. It's like a leg kick. Yes. Move. Well, he's not even, it's not even a self defense move. He's like making, he's forcing contact with the person so that he can fall down. But it looks like, yeah, it's interesting. So it looks like got file. So here you'll see him. This watch, watch no one's there. Watch, watch. He jumps, two jumps straight up in the air, straight up, just straight up in the air. And this guy analyzes several shots where he does this. Well, any man's then um, then they show when he's contested, right? And when he's contested, he jumps up in the air and look, he throws his body weight forward and then it falls down. So in the hopes that there'll be a foul, they're saying like if you look at the way his body moves, when someone's contesting him, he moves and Leeny his legs towards them to make contact. Do you think that's involuntary or voluntary? Involuntary. You see the problem is that pencil, neck, Dork fucking pushing that now

Speaker 3:          01:20:08       he's a specifically no, and especially like in the last two or three years for getting himself to the free throw line. Right. At a way higher clip than that almost anybody in history. So like that's what they're also saying. Like you can't fault him for that because he's using the rules of the game to play the game. Right. So this guy is, who is this guy who was examining this van pelt and he's got the heck events, health center guy. So the head sports and a guy is analyzing this and he's realizing that the legs are moving in a direction towards the other player because the guys there, which is might exactly be what he's doing. It might be that or it might be that he has a different reaction when someone's in front of him and he almost wants to kick the guy away from him.

Speaker 3:          01:20:47       Yeah. I don't know. Most Times fouled on a three point attempt. He has 95 60 more than anybody in league. So yeah, I'm going Scott van pelt and they made it a rule to cause you may be correct. There's a big thing that happened over the weekend and their game because you have to give the guy a space to land because there are a couple of years ago there were a couple of defensive players that got in trouble for hurting people. They're getting their ankles turned, ruining their career, which has been ruining this team's chances to win a championship. Lots of money involved. They made a, it's a flagrant foul like it's very bad to do that and the referees all of a sudden didn't didn't call this on Sunday, like the very first time all year they stopped calling it. That's why they're talking about it really and they stopped calling it because people are taking advantage of it. W why they stopped calling it is the big question that people were literally talking about for 48 hours. Like why are they doing this? Bringing up the question of like, are the officials really involved in the game and it's become a big discussion.

Speaker 2:          01:21:41       Another reason why I won't watch it. Do you watch sports? I watch football. That's it. Yup. Do you worry about brain damage? Uh, well yeah cause it's going to really the NFL. Do you look at a different length right away? Do you look at it differently than you did like before that concussion movie? Uh, well I, I played high school football. I've, I've got hit so hard that I've seen stars and that kind of stuff. But I think that can happen. I don't look at it differently. To answer your question. No, no. I think it, you know, they might change the helmets and they've tried that over the years. Do you remember like what, it was just leather helmets. There was less concussions cause you would not lead with your head. Now you have a weapon on your head and people have used this such and so I would love, you know how they do throwback uniforms?

Speaker 2:          01:22:27       Let's see. I mean let's go throw back equipment. Let's put the leather helmet back on. Tech Tech Tech, stupid face mask off. You really should. But you'd have to change so much. You'd have to change so much in the way people, there's so many different factors. The way that practice where they set up plays. Yeah. He would have to be a new game. I don't think it's going to happen. I think the perception of the helmet being safer, fuck the game up. I really think did, uh, you know, all right. I used to think that a bare knuckle boxing, I like, they should have bare knuckles in the UFC, but then I've been watching this bare knuckle boxing stuff and people get caught up so bad. Now I'm thinking, you know what? It's better to have knuckles. It's better. Yeah, it's better for the fighters. The helmets, the leather helmets were padded.

Speaker 2:          01:23:10       They just weren't like a hard shell. And the Shell is what made it, uh, you know, they used it as a weapon. So that's literally the only way you're going to be able to stop some of this brain damage and you're still not going to meet. We'll stop at all. There's still colliding into each other. They say these guys are getting brain damage from getting hit in the chest. They're getting hit in the chest and the head snapped back. Green's swashing around inside their skull. Well, they're, they're changing. I think, um, maybe like a younger, like little league now it's like you can't do tackle football until a certain age. So now that everyone's, you know, it's all flag football til a certain age, I think may doubt that'll probably happen. And Yeah. And then, uh, the practices will be different where we only do pads once a week.

Speaker 2:          01:23:54       Well then for the real game will be amazing if the ever came up with something that definitively fixed it, like some stem cell treatment or something like that, that regenerate brain tissue and bring you back to your normal state. Right. If they do that, then we don't have to worry about it anymore. Right. But until that man, oh, that's got to be around the corner, that's close. I think that's a very complex question of how to regenerate neural tissue, brain tissue, how to get rid of all those abscesses and all those things that you see in those people's brains. And FCT, they develop these like holes in their brain. Yeah. It's serious shit. You know, it's um, wild ass sport though. Did you play football or no, no, no. I wrestled in high school. I was a little man. I wasn't that I've wrestled 134 pounds.

Speaker 2:          01:24:39       He could have been a good run, a bit fucked up. Fuck Outta here. There was another dude chill. The fastest guys are small and just, you know, I was in that facet runner. Oh. So fast kicking and punching and stuff. But I wasn't really that faster. Runner didn't do a lot of running. But um, when I was, uh, in high school, when I was wrestling, they were trying to tell me like the coach, coach Murphy, who was also the wrestling coach, he was also the football coach and he's like, oh, come on, you're a sick fuck. You should, you should play football. Yeah. And I was like, dude, that guy plays football. We had this heavyweight, his name is Bobby Baker. He was 300 pounds. He was enormous. It was so big. I was like, he's not squashing me the fuck out of here. The hardest I've ever been hit was by little dead and practice.

Speaker 2:          01:25:20       Um, probably like five sat there and he just, he was a, a db and it was a practice. I was like third string running back and they're like, I was just running up the gut and I was falling into the end zone. Right. It was over. And this k he had a running start like 20 yards headstart and it was like he came up from out of the ground and went foul and knocked me back up. Whoa. And that's the hardest I've ever been hit. It was by a little guy. So you know, think about a few moments peto torpedo with a hard helmet on. He led with that helmet. But you know how fast I go, really good athlete can run and just think of all that mass behind them. Adjusted Cock crash. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:26:04       Yeah. Those, the way those guys get hit and the amount of force behind them getting hit, it's probably unlike anything in sports other than a car accident. Right. Other than like the white car. Yeah. Nascar, there's, I think they should bring, they should, uh, you know how hockey league is still fighting hockey. Nascar fights pull out in the pitstop let's Duke it out. Let's, yeah, let's say if there's a caution and everyone else was lapping. You've got two guys, have a beef pull over, get out of the car in the middle of the infield grass. We have a wrestling rink and it's like full on. Let's go get in the rink. We'll get it, we'll give you two minutes. And then, uh, if you win that match baby, you get a little time shaving off. You know, so it's uh, there's advantage to, uh, add watched that more.

Speaker 1:          01:26:46       I feel we're like half wrestling. Half your leap, right? Mascot? Nascar's a weird one, right? Because it's, it's obviously fun to watch. It's fun to be there, but it's not as fun as Formula One. You Watch Formula One, you're like, well, these guys are going way faster on those wheels. Yeah. Yeah. I mean that's a whole nother thing. Those wheels touch. It's over. You're in the air right now, these guys and ask on a lot of that happens and it's fine. You know it's true that one wheel of wow. Yeah, and those guys die. Yeah. Well I guess Nascar guys did too. Yeah. Not as much anymore, but me. Then anybody's driving a fucking car going fast can die. What am I saying? But there's something, if you ever see the video between, um, they showed gt three rs racing versus Formula One racing. It's the same track and they show a good gt three car look, a Porsche going around this car really fast and then they show the same exact path being taken by a formula one car.

Speaker 1:          01:27:44       And you're like, Jesus, watch this. Watch this. Watch this one on the left and of them, whoa. How much faster they are now. What's the, okay, that's the same track and save track. Exact same turn. Look how much God damn faster. They are bad. So why is that car going on the right? I don't know, man. That's insane. It seems amazing and perfect line. He's cutting. See how the line perfect racing line is cut into the groove. Like you see that darkness. Yup. Yup. That's a bunch of talented drivers and other thank you. I think the fastest I've ever been was like maybe 115. You ever been on a race track? I bid on a racetrack. Yeah. Yeah. That not, you know, not at a pace car, you know, but a NASCAR, but the, uh, but the Daytona 500 has that huge, you know, the incline and just being down there and seeing that standing there next to it, like, well, I didn't know his best steep.

Speaker 1:          01:28:41       You have to go fast and stay on that then. Yeah. Then it's pretty wild. Yeah. And people get hit up there, the bump wheels up there and collide and fucking spin out each other. Look at that thing. Yeah. Yeah. That's a serious bank. A wall that is a little turn to the picture, but still. What is, um, what do you think that degree is? Like what angle? Uh, they've told me before, I forget it. It's probably like, it's pretty serious though. 20 degrees, 31 degrees degrees. Whoa. Wow. That's crazy. That's insanity. That's, I mean, if you would be nervous, you on a skateboard on that thing, you don't have to go a certain speed just to stay up on the probably right. Yeah. It's such an American sport, man. Nascar's so American because it's allowed. It's fuck, the cars are gross. They look to see, oh they're so gross looking.

Speaker 1:          01:29:36       They don't look anything like now I'll call how many sponsors are all right. You have a really nice car that's supposed to be the model that that car is and that they can ask. Our car looks gross and they, the decal, they make fake headlights. It's a sticker of the head, my wife and put that on there. Yeah. What are we doing when you're lying to me? Yeah. It's a fascinating piece of equipment though. Yeah. That we've decided to make these things that just drive really fast and then hurl them around the circle, this oval over and over. So high tech, like every, they count every law, the drafting of it. They know it. Every, uh, I end goal that's, you know, all that. But back in the day, it was just a couple of good old boys moonshot trying to outrun the cops. Yeah, that's, that's what I want to see.

Speaker 1:          01:30:21       That was hot rodding and it's fine as that's what it was. That's what I want to say. Put motion in them cars and that fun. That's where it all came from. Yes. Guys are trying to figure out how to get the fuck away from cops. Cops used to have those fanciest cars. Men you think that they had to chase people and like caprice classics, you know that is with but bench seats. Yeah. That is the worst car. Free meddling with dress shoes. God, they make them wear a stupid shoes. Yeah. Nike, that's back in the day or on the page while I taught, I was on the ocean. It was Daytona 500 the first event. Uh, you know, I think so. I think, well I'm not, no, I don't know about that. But I know that's what was on the, on the sand. The first Daytona was on the sand, I believe.

Speaker 1:          01:31:08       So these are on the sand? Yeah. The driving in the sand. This is crazy. They're not going as fast as those cars are such a convertible. It looks like the Batmobile. They are convertibles. They're can wearables. Wow. That's what I want to see when I'll bring back the day convertible and Nascar. I want to see these dudes faces when do, why they made him in convertibles. Yeah. Well they got the roll bar. Yeah. But still, I mean I bet it gets too hot in there. They probably didn't have air conditioning. Right? Yeah. That's probably it. It's on fire. It's easier to get out when you don't have a roof. Yeah. Yeah. Those people probably died. Those things all the time. Those shitty cars. Like if you were a car racer back then you were going to crash. There's no way you're going to know. You're not going to keep it together every time.

Speaker 1:          01:31:53       Uh, what's the fastest you think you've been in a vehicle? I want to say cause we're on the, ah, well, you know, you don't say where, what country it was in. Uh, I don't know. It could be in Germany on the auto mile. In the one hundreds. Yeah. Yeah. There's some, um, fail. No, no. That thing that would have fallen apart. Yeah. Flying off the, the, um, the newest cars though, the problem is they're in this horsepower war where every year they have to have a faster zero to 60, and now they've gotten to the point where they're, they're ridiculously fast. Like the cars of today. Like if you just bought a regular car today, it'd be faster than a muscle car was in the 1970s. Right. And you wouldn't even feel it. Yeah. You wouldn't even know. Couldn't even tell you're going that fast.

Speaker 1:          01:32:42       Yeah. Like if you bought like a Honda accord today, it would probably handle better and drive faster than any supercar from 1970. Right? Yeah. Probably fight the gas. Yeah. You can't feel it. Yeah. They're real. No way safer. Yeah. Way more boring. Have you driven a Tesla? No. Strive that love to those stupid, isn't it electric cars zero to 60, way quicker than gas? You wouldn't even believe it. I mean, it's gotta be right. Yeah. It's just instant power. Instant power. And that one has a four wheel drive. The, uh, the Tesla model s 100 d yeah. It's got four, four wheel drive. And so it's got an engine in the front and an engine in the rear and it flies. Yeah. It's so it's violates physics that you get like a whiplash and that think of rollercoaster dude. Yeah. You can't believe how fast it's going.

Speaker 1:          01:33:33       It's stupid. And they're making us stupider one. They're making a faster one that goes zero to 60 in 1.9 seconds. Oh Lord. Yeah. It's a Tesla roadster. It looks dope too. It looks like a spaceship. I would love to travel. Do you, uh, are you still living in la? Where are you at now? I moved back to Hickory, North Carolina. Damn. I was out here at 18 years. Just couldn't do it anymore. No. Well, it was a couple things. You know, my career has always been like a roller coaster and good years, bad years. And um, I actually just admits I miss my family. I haven't, you know, I missed out on a lot growing up, you know, so, and the market was really good. I had this condo in studio city. I bought it for a certain amount and then it's, it's, it gained value.

Speaker 1:          01:34:15       And I thought, well, this, if I'm going to do this, now's the time to pull the trigger. And I think I saw you at the Improv. Why not say I'm Outta here, I'm bouncing. And I, uh, my gold road so much. Right. Yeah. Well that's the thing too. And the industry's changed. Like, you know, I already have a manager and an agent. It's not like I need to be here for every little audition, you know, I'll put myself on tape. I got eastbound and down on a tape. I got Harold and Kumar on a tape while, you know, and then now the second audition, yeah. You fly up for it. But like, you know, getting your foot in the door, that tape, I could do that now. They, it's just changed so much. That's if you want to act and you do so much stand up on the road, there's really no reason to be here unless you just want to perform exact door all the time.

Speaker 1:          01:34:55       That's right. Yeah. Yeah. So, uh, and I moved back to Hickory and I was going to get myself a nice lake house in Lake Hickory. Yup. Still want to do that. But then as soon as I get home, you know Thanksgiving Dad has a stroke so I see that happen that you ever seen someone who had a stroke you there when an app I was looking right at him and it was weird because my dad's a funny guy. Like I thought maybe because we were going to eat Thanksgiving dinner late so like it was like a 6:00 PM thing we were doing to get other people in the house and so he was complaining all day about not eating like I'm hungry. Where are we? What are we going to eat? We're not going to eat. I'm looking around at him. He's sitting next to the fireplace and he just like, he just like nosedives but just head first right into the hardwood floor and it was like bump, you hear like a thump.

Speaker 1:          01:35:44       And I was like, Oh, dad's making a joke. We haven't eaten yet. It's a, you know, it's making me think about it like low blood sugar or something and I was kind of laughing at my brother's leg. He hit really hard, his head hit that floor way too hard for that to be a joke. And then you walk over to him and arms Kerlin up one. I was going like that and it's like this is a stroke. And we called nine one one they came pretty quick but he suffered some serious brain damage right here. And so he's paralyzed his left side now. But I was in a weird way, happy that I was at home when this happened because you know how we're still out here and that should happen, right? I'd be, I'd be hate in life, but the fact that I'm there and able to help mom out, you know, going through it, all of this, this whole thing, because she's got glaucoma and she's got brittle bones, you know, she can't physically lift him up and do stuff.

Speaker 1:          01:36:37       And the fact that we were in the house and able to help, it's crazy that it wasn't, I didn't see the drooping of the face. I didn't see that happen. You know, that's what people say when you see a stroke, you see like the drooping happens. Yeah, I like that. That fat chicken total recall, you know, wait, let's see. We're at explodes. Get rid of her. How to surprise. I thought I thought that that was what it was, but now he just hit the floor. And so have you toured it at all since that or if you just been small places? I couldn't, I didn't take on extra gigs. I, but I didn't cancel the ones I had. So the ones that I could drive to definitely as well. Let me go. I have a brother who's there as well. So, um, but I definitely didn't take on anything for, you know, since Thanksgiving than it wasn't already there.

Speaker 1:          01:37:27       So yeah, it's uh, but he's, he's at a skilled nursing facility now and they showed us the X. Right. You know, the, the Mri of the brain damage of the happening at a clotted artery he's got, now he's keeps getting UTI infections because he has a catheter because it also, it doesn't just fuck with your muscles. It's the organs on that side too. So his bladder's got to relearn how to operate. So he's got a catheter, you know, that, that that's just opens you up for Uti infections a lot. And those, I don't know if you know, they're like Uti infections when you're older, like it really devastates you cause you, you hallucinate so you see shit. Yeah. And it's weird being in there and you know, he would like, uh, I make sure that bears not out there. I'm like a bear. Like he keeps hearing her think there's a bear outside the window.

Speaker 1:          01:38:17       So yeah. That, that was happening back home for that. But, um, are there bears where you live? Not, no, not, not the skilled nursing facility. I mean, there might be some points. Yeah, no bears I allowed to say twink I don't tell trouble. He used to be able to just make a joke about that was dangerous. Yes. Yeah. No, but uh, yeah. Hoping for the best. Still going through Rehab, occupational therapy, physical therapy. Did they think that he'll be able to recover some function on his left side? I think you know, that they always want to get, dangle a little bit of light of hope at the end of the car. Chases panicking. But uh, you know, some people recover quickly, some people not at all. Some people three years later can recover. You need a, here you go three years later. Yeah, I mean it, you know, so we're just still, we're still doing all of it.

Speaker 1:          01:39:10       John Singleton just died from a stroke and he was watched 51 51. Yeah. It could happen to anybody. They didn't age. Luke Perry, same thing. 51 stroke. That's right. Yup. Yeah. Crazy. A lot of strokes or happened. Fuck man. I wonder if those folks smoke cigarettes. Well, my dad definitely did. Yeah. Yeah. They said and cigarettes contribute pretty heavily to strokes. He used to smoke a lot when he was younger and then quit, you know, when he was in his late forties. Um, but that was a lot, you know, back then we, you'd smoke at 12 years old or something. I'll pack. I don't know if singleton smoked, but I do know Luke Perry did. Yeah. Yeah. And this woman that I talked to who was a neurologist was telling me that that's a significant factor. It raises your chances of stroke. Pretty significant. Yeah. So I'm back in hair cream, but I came, I'm going to cut my ideas to come out here, you know, for pilot season.

Speaker 1:          01:40:05       Keep doing it, right? Yeah. Right. And then hit the store. I was there last night. It was fun. It was good seeing you, man. You too, man. That's doing the roast battle. So that's out of my comfort zone too. Oh, it's so mean. It is. That's not me. No, I know you're a nice guy, but I'm like, okay, you got your shake hands hug at the end. I'm glad they hug too. Well Brian Moses, the host of it is awesome because he's such a nice guy. Then when he does that show, it seems like it's okay because he's so nice and some funny too. Yeah. I like him hosting it and make it seem like it's okay. And Jeff Ross been there sort of like letting everybody know kind of what the rules are, you know, like listen, you know, hey Jepson, interesting cat, right? Like he's really created like roasting is.

Speaker 1:          01:40:50       Yeah. It's like it's come back, he's carved out that whole niche. It's all him. It's all him down. Yeah. But it really is. I mean there was so little roasting going on before Jeff Ross. There was, the roasting was a thing of the past. It was old friar's club type deal. Yeah. It was like old Jerry Lewis Dean and that kind of stuff. You know? It's kind of amazing though these days here. The amazing, yeah, they were great. I like those guys are so mean to each other. But they were all friends and they were laughing. Yeah. While it's happening. That's also the difference too. It's like those rows, there weren't that many of them and they were friends like legitimately friends. That's the thing. Yeah, they already were friends. Yeah. A lot of these roasts now it's like who am I doing right and I'm going to come out swinging.

Speaker 1:          01:41:31       Yup. Me. Yeah, me and I feel like I got to get to know you but fuck, I really bust your balls otherwise I'm just being a dick. Exactly. But it is just being a dick. But it's really clever. Yeah, it is. I enjoy it for from far you though. Yes, me too. But I think it's a great showcase. Showcase for joke writing. 100%. Yeah. Yeah. Really good for the best ones. Although this the quickest, right to the joke. Brutal. You know the guys, there's a guy last night it pulled out a laptop and was trying to do some voice created like you know Stephen Hawking voice or something and I'm like, this is taking too long. He had a, it's not working like just the in the neck. The next guy had like, it was like four words. Pat. Pat, Pam. Yeah. That's a skill I wish I had.

Speaker 1:          01:42:20       See, I'm like, I get up there, I'm a goof ball. I tell stories, I am animated, I move around. I, but I envy those guys who can go but a bang, Bada boom. I wish I had that skill. You could develop that skill, but I have, but you've gotten better at it over the years. But you have a style, you have your own John Reape style. Right. And people like your style. They would be mad like, hey man, why are you doing that? A lot of them, but I'm anxious guy. I like the guy who tells the great stories. Is he doing an impression of a comedian? Yeah. But do you remember like when you first started out there was like a way you thought you had to be? Yeah. You know, when did you do anything like cringy that you look back on now and he'd go, what was I back that I made?

Speaker 1:          01:43:05       I used to come out, like I used to dance a lot. I was the Hickory dance machine, Korean dance machine. I would come out dancing really a like, okay, the a lot of energies there. What kind of music? Whatever was popular, you know, something from jock jams volume to, you know, snap. I got the power. Oh, I got the, it's getting real. So I come out dancing. I made up the stupid little, uh, I do a shovel dance or rake dance, a mob dance, and then I would stop and do, do comedy and then I would get bored with myself. And then I danced to get in the middle. This is what I was featuring. And then they have to get it. The hickory dance machine. My favorite one though, this was, I'm actually proud of this dance. It was any guy washing women's laundry in the 18 hundreds dance.

Speaker 1:          01:43:58       It's a very specific dance. A guy won't look at you. Oh, it's tiring it off. Well, looky here. That's it. So he smells it. Well, this before the beard, look at those Chins. Look at that baby face. Yeah. How old were you back then? Oh, this was a week ago, I think. Now this is like, it's like Russia. That's the theater in uh, right outside of Hickory. A place in little nowhere. I was like 700 people. Wow. Yeah. Yeah. Out of shape right there. Where did you first start doing standup and Raleigh, North Carolina at Charlie Goodnight's. That's a great spot. It's one of the people love it. It's like one of the best clubs on the east coast to say it is somebody buying that place? Yeah. Well Brad, it was Tommy Williams forever. Then he sold it to Brad Rader. Brad readers sold it to the guys that own helium so that, you know, uh, uh, Philadelphia in Portland, that club chain.

Speaker 1:          01:44:54       So now they own it. It's just called good nights now. We took the child off of it, so it's still a great club. I don't know. Charlie good. I was some cowboy, bland. I think maybe they didn't like that. What's wrong with child boy? Chinese. Great. But have you played there before? Yeah, a bunch of times. It's hard not to do great in that club. And it's also can kind of uh, you know, ruin you in a weird way. If you start out at a club where everyone kills all the time cause you're thinking, okay, I've got this, well it's been a week after, nailed it. Kabod world, what do you got? And then you'd go to some other little shitty one nighter. It's like, no, no, you can't dance here. That's interesting. Like what do you think made it so good? Was it the dimensions of the room?

Speaker 1:          01:45:37       Was it the crowd because of the town, the town's cool town. Yeah. Towns. Great. It's a college town. It's also the capital. Yeah. So you get a mix of like, you know, your, your politicians, your college professors or students and right outside of it, the rest of the world. So it's a mix of everything and it's really close to campus too. So I dunno, I think it's, they are just that club. It was good at what they did. You know, like you got until one night or it's a bar. Like, I remember the first time I did a gig outside of a comedy club, it was just a bar is a pool hall that had a comedy night. And I went there on a Wednesday and in me and this other guy walk in where the comedians and they were like, Oh yeah, so, uh, we're here for the show that comedians are like, oh shit, that's tonight.

Speaker 1:          01:46:24       Huh? Suck. All right. Uh, John to go get that amplifier. So it's like there's among a, you kidding me? And then you have to tell people to stop playing pool so you can tell your jokes that right away people hate you. Oh, you can't get people to stop playing pool or go back to goodness. Oh Wow. So that was your first venture. First one outside of a club was like a one nighter pool hall. Wow. Yeah. That's a rough first one nighter. Yeah. Yeah. It had to. Luckily, you know, I only had to do like 10 minutes, but I, that 10 minutes seemed like an hour. Charlie goodnight's also was a club that had been around for so long that it's such a history, cause there's so many comics came through there. Everybody came through there. Everybody, I know, everybody came through there. Everybody. So like the people that lived in that town, they were used to good comedy.

Speaker 1:          01:47:13       That's right. They got great comedy every week. Yep. And uh, yeah, and in the 80s was the hay day. You know what else is like that xannies in Nashville. That's my favorite comedy club. Fuck. Great spot man is my favorite one. So fuck that. Xannies God places the Shit. Yep. I been going there for years, uh, as a lot of deaf teacher in those walls. Probably. Yeah. There eight by tens. Yeah. There's eight by tens of comics and many of them are, there's a guy named Brian Cow. Kylie. I know Brian. Colin does this is a different one. Oh, I know the one you're thinking of. The guy from Boston. Yeah. This is a different one. Same name. Uh, but he, uh, started in Nashville. It's big, big, big guy, right. Play all the way, like five, 600 pounds. And, you know, he's a polite guys and hey, I'd love to open for you and you know, do the road and all that stuff.

Speaker 1:          01:48:01       I said, sure. He just show up at these gigs and you want to go up, I'll let you, I don't care. And so it got to be a thing. You know, he did a, he did a Gig for me and uh, uh, apprentices held my hometown and then that night he goes, well, I'm just going to drive back to Raleigh tonight, which is like a three hour drive. And he died on the way there. Some drunk driver hit him and he flipped his car and he didn't have a seatbelt on cause he didn't have the extender. He couldn't physically put it on. And so I had no matter how big you are, if you're flipping that car, you're going out the window. And so it killed him and his headshot hangs right there above that door. And so that's one of many people on that wall.

Speaker 1:          01:48:42       There is no longer with us. A lot of comedians die. Yeah. But that, that, when do you think that [inaudible] was started? I want to say in the 70s probably there this started Chicago. Nice. Xannies Chicago. There's a real Dorfman's that's the Chicago one, right? That looks like, yeah, that's not, yeah, that's a weird angry, that's club. That one. Yeah. That one's not as great to me because it's long and boxing and the fourth thing you get back to the bar area, the more chance you have to lose them back there. Yeah. But it's still only 150 that's in the eye. Yeah. That's tiny shit. But, but it's, I swear Nashville Nashville's perfect. You get the flanks. It's, it's it, it has a balcony right there at the top. Shout out to the door and everybody just has a good time at xannies. Great Club. My favorite one and then a second favorite would be, uh, Denver.

Speaker 1:          01:49:37       I was bummed out when they locked Denver is fantastic. But I was bummed out when they lost the punchline in Atlanta. That was what, that was all not anyone, man. They've lost that went to a parking issue. Is that what it was? Yeah. Now when it was shaped like a barn. Perfect. Yep. And it had a small balcony, but they just packed people on top of each other. Yeah. So you didn't have room to be, you know, uh, on your phone or talking. It was like you're right on top of people. You had to walk through the crowd to get to the, to the stage. Unless you, I got that one weird green room the whole time. Well, there's no bathroom. That one weird green room. Yeah. And electronic spot. And then had that sign on the back wall that said, quit trying to be Hicks.

Speaker 1:          01:50:18       Yeah, yeah. In the, yeah, there was all sorts of writing on the wall. It's weird, Atlanta, because we're all kind of hit. I remember there was an upstairs area too where you could look down like, it was a little about the DJ was out there. He had like, that's where their office was and they had like, it's like the heckle that maybe like five people could sit up there. I did a, I did a good practical joke at that place one time. There's this comedian named James Sibley. Great Guy. Very funny southern dude. Uh, we were sharing a condo somewhere, I think in myrtle beach. And, uh, as a joke, I thought it'd be funny when he's leaving to put a condom wrapper in his bag and I go, ha ha. Not telling you so fast. So I did that. Right. Did this happen to you?

Speaker 1:          01:51:14       No. Okay. No, but I can still, he goes away. I don't see him for a year or two, maybe three. And he's divorced now. Well, the first thing he did, this was at Atlanta punchline. He walked up to, it's like, you motherfucker, you know what you did to me. You want me to get divorced? Like it was this long thing was like, dude, I am so sorry. I was stupid. It was just dumb. I already had, I wouldn't even planned out. It was sitting right there. I just do it in there. Huh? Maybe he'll find it when, as he's packing to go home. I didn't, I didn't think you felt, you know, so I felt really bad about it. He goes, I'm going to get you back. And uh, I'm like, okay. And that stupid green room they have in that corner at the punchline, right where you're sitting in there, there's no access to a bathroom or if you just poke your head out, everybody can see you like who's in there?

Speaker 1:          01:51:54       What's going on? Right. So I'm sitting in there, he goes, all right, here's what I'm going to do when you go onstage, because he was opening for me. I'm going to put mustard all over the door, knobs in here. Okay, and you're going to be in such a hurry to get out of there and go back to your stupid march table that you don't have to go. Remember that I told you there's mustard all over this door knob and he's just going to grab mustard on your head. It wasn't as good as me getting to him with a condom obviously, but he was right. Like I go on stage. He told you he was going to do, he told me he was going to do it. I said, a cat's out the bag. Jen's not going to happen. And of course I grabbed it right away.

Speaker 1:          01:52:29       I was like, okay. He's still close with them. Do you know? Well, not, I mean as close as I can be, but uh, we're good. We're fine. Did you have to talk to his wife? No. He's got a new life now. I'm not going to be wonderful. It was, it was the first step. Maybe so first 10 the first name. That's right. Yeah. You're welcome. You're welcome. New Lives. Glass is half full. Okay. Settle the fuck down. Everybody welcome. Do White. Yeah. God's plan. That's right. Yeah. In a weird way. I was like, God, come on man. A lot of ways. What if God was one of us? He is. It's me. Isn't that a song he used it is who sang that song? It if Jane Osborne, I think. Yeah. You know what's really funny? Am I right? Yeah. Charles born pretty close. Pretty close.

Speaker 1:          01:53:12       You're not impressed with the speed of it. I was very quick. Look at Dj from the nineties jock jams. Yeah. Whatever happened to that lady. That was a good song. Yeah. She had her nose pierce. He had beautiful curly hair. She just said, listen, this is not for me. I'd rather be in a hippie commune somewhere doing yoga every day. Well, I wonder where she, maybe she is doing that. Probably. What does she still out there still hostile. They're still making it every day I'm hustling to, to, to Allen and when I go into this, that's on my playlist of working out. When I get on the treadmill every day I'm hustling. Yeah. That one gets me going. Any sort. I got a dose Katt Williams started it though. Like when I saw Kat Williams do his bit about like you could have any stupid job and if you hear that song you do the best you can at it.

Speaker 1:          01:53:56       It was a great bit and I'm like the wasn't and that's where the first time I heard the song I'll go, I'll walk that. Yeah. I'm on the treadmill. Katt Williams has some all time. Great bits. Yeah. Especially the earlier stuff. All that pimp chronicles stuff is a murderer. Shit. Yes. So fun. He was coming up like right when he was starting to blow up. His stuff was so good. Yeah, it was so good. He was so way that he talks. I did too. And, and it's really fun. Fun Shit. Great comic. Uh, so there's Rick Ross on my playlist and then I also do a soundtrack from flash. Gordon Queen, you know, you're the best or, and now that's quite a kid, but a valid, he sound check that was on there too. You, you're the best around. No one's ever, yeah, that'll rocky. Obviously I'll go with movies that kind of inspired me when I was a kid and get that soundtrack and then I get on that elliptical machine and now I'm doing the elliptical, you know, for the universe.

Speaker 1:          01:54:52       Like Flash Gordon, he letting motherfuckers know I'm saving the planet. Ever watch the old Flash Gordon from the 1950s? No, that wasn't the first one I saw was the cheat Chitty one of the 80s. Uh, I was on a plane, not really recently. It's like I guess more like a couple of years ago. And they had one of those video catalog so you can just watch stuff. I think it was an international flight. Yeah. And it had a old TV shows and it had flash Gordon and I watched a bunch of episodes of flash court while it was weird. It's weird to watch. Yeah, it's weird to watch what people thought like space. Who's going to be like and aliens. It's so strange. Yeah. I mean I think Flash Gordon was probably from the fifties right? It was a comic book, wasn't it? Yes. Yeah, so originally a comic book. See if he could get pull up video of they need to remake that film. Photos of the green room and the punchline. I was looking for that

Speaker 2:          01:55:44       Hick slide. Oh we've showed that before. I wish they would remake Flash Gordon and make it a comedy but keep the soundtrack cause it's queen. Oh human rights. These huge queens. Huge right now. Keep the exact same soundtrack. Make Flash Gordon a comedy Jack Black get does. Well you thinking of a Flash Gordon, the movie the movie. I'm sorry. Move Way, way, way. There's the original flush board with Maine. The merciless collide to some ball. Let's look at him. How Wa, how weird does he look? We got flash like that's what they thought. People are going to be wearing weird neck powers in the future belt buckles. It's such a strange look man. It just a lightning bolt on your chest pull up was a good deal of it. So we could watch a video because it's so, it's so weird to watch cause it looks like, what years did it say 56 c four to 55 Ming the merciless.

Speaker 2:          01:56:35       So this is where he like, it's so shitty. Like the special effects were. So this is not even the movie. This is the, I know but I mean I'm saying the claim jumpers, Steve Holland does Flash Gordon, Irene Champlin, Dale Arden, look she's hot. She's hot in a real way. Yeah. There was no faking it back then. Doctors are calling. Yeah, same care. I have not seen this though. So this was a whole TV show. How many episodes do you think they made? If I had to guess, I bet they made 50 or something like that. Look at that. She's got a shirt. She is hot.

Speaker 2:          01:57:14       It was like a drill. She's holding a drill. Women back then all had flat butts unless they did gymnastics. Right. Unless you're some freak of nature accident and then that is some sort of weird deal. Does stupid. That's a jackhammer that you know what the handheld Jackhammer. It looks like that Tim Tam. That there gun. That's what it looks like right there. What does this thing, this is a thing as I do, it's for massage. Oh shit hurts. May I? Yes. Hang on. Probably shouldn't do it right in front of them on a microphone. It's great. It doesn't hurt to feel good for loosening up the muscles. No Bro. That's what they had. Good Lord. Yeah. That's their weapon. But to me I'm gonna Punch you in the face real fast. It's always weird seeing what people thought the future was going to be like once the futurity hits. Yeah. Cause if you think of that movie alien, like didn't we figure that out? It was like 2015 or something like that. They thought the first one was in 2000 with a soul. Yeah. Yeah. Like yeah, it was 2015 yeah. It was something along like, well back to the futures classic, you know, their future was a, what was it, two, what was the future? Cause it happened in 1985 and they went to, and the second when they went to the future, but it was like 2015 or something, right? Yeah. Something

Speaker 1:          01:58:42       like that. What befell is the billionaire now because he took that stupid a sports almanac and bet on a bunch of shit. I watched that a couple of years ago at a movie theater in Bozeman, Montana with my family. They had like a back to the future night where they were playing it, you know the appointment, the old classic movie. It's fucking great. That won't show up. It's so good. It's especially cool to see an old movie in a movie theater. I got know they do those. Sometimes it's certain movie theaters will have like they'll screen and old moving. Yeah, it's fucking, I went to the Hollywood bowl and watched back to the future with and it had an orchestra playing live. Ah, the soundtrack. You know the movie as it's happening and you kind of forget that that's, that shit's happening right now. Yeah, we do that every year. We go to see the nightmare before Christmas.

Speaker 1:          01:59:25       Oh yeah, they do that. Yeah. Yeah. It's great. You ever go to the cemetery and watch a movie? No. Forever. I did a show there once though. He did? Yeah. Duncan Trussell used to host a show. I love him. So what outside? No, inside there's like an inside place where you just stand up. Okay. It was really weird. Yeah, we did stand out. Did that one at the center, these concerts there and shit. Yeah. Yeah. Well that's what they have that one gigantic white wall and they just project movies and everyone sits on the lawn. It's like 5,000 people. Where does that, I'll watch purple rain cemetery. Look at that. I want to scream. This is super weird. Scream the are movie cemetery. That would be good. That's actually a great move. But they, yeah. Cinespia they, you know, I was there watching a purple rain and Dave Chappelle was there.

Speaker 1:          02:00:10       Um, they come out, there's a Dj, they do stuff before and after the movie and what addresses up like characters from the film. Wow. Yeah. That's awesome. Have you seen proper writing the movie lately? No. That's great. Is it? No. Yes and no. Yes and no. Acting is so bad. I made great sarcastically prints. It's that. It's so funny when he, there's this one when he first makes his full face on film. Right. And this, the movie, it takes a minute. There's this one scene where it was, the Apollonia is walking off and he's mad and he just like whips around real fast and his hair comes and does that. And then everybody in that, in the cemetery was watching this in front of like 5,000 people. Every girl is like looking at it.

Speaker 1:          02:00:57       Hello. This guy was four foot one. Oh Man. But it was 80 pounds kind of changed music. Yeah, I know. I was a huge fan. Yeah. I saw this one in a theory. Came out was the first time that like our French kissed a girl and touched a booby was done this movie. Well. It's also like, oh, and there's a lot of why, and mine started this movie. There was a lot. Yeah, it didn't. He hits her in the mirror. Yeah. And he's like, oh, I want to be like my dad. But he actually hits her and he says, he said the f word as well. Yeah. Not Wow. Yeah, that's right. I'm afraid to say anything. I don't do it. Now you know about deadname. Oh, always free dead naming. No names. You can get kicked off of Twitter for life, bitch for light. I'm barely even on Twitter.

Speaker 1:          02:01:47       Really? How to, yeah. Well I'm, I'm on there, but I'm going to, Facebook seems to be where my people are. Really. What people are those rednecks from Hickory?
