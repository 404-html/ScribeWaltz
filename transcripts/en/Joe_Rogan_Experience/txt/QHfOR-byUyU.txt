If you are a, someone who runs her own business, go into the post office can be a real pain in the ass.

Speaker 2:          00:05:48       Joe Rogan podcast by night.

Speaker 1:          00:05:52       Too Loud, right? Yeah. I'm sorry. The. We have an adjustment thing here.

Speaker 3:          00:05:57       It's too loud. We can actually lower your volume. Where you at? Are you this one right here? Is that better? Is that better for you? Yeah. Okay, cool. Sorry about that. Didn't mean to blow your ears off. Thanks for joining us. Thanks for Douglas Rushkoff. If you do not know of him, hat is a, what'd you call yourself? A media analyst. Which a theorist immediate Arthur. Mainly author mainly. Yeah. And your new book is called present shock when everything happens all at once, is that everything happens now. And then when everything happens now I saw quite a few of your videos online. It really, really, really interesting conversations and one of them that really struck me was, um, you know, several of them that struck me, but one of them was your story of being mugged and you, you told people on an online room like where you got mugged and people were upset that you in telling them that you got, didn't telling the world that you got mugged there.

Speaker 3:          00:06:57       It was lowering their property values. Yeah. That was a bad one. That's so crazy. Yeah. I mean it was one thing to get mugged. It was just kind of freaky in itself, you know, and whatever shaman weirdness goes with that. But, um, I guess what I was trying to do, I mean deep down was probably elicit, you know, love and affection from people on my list. You know, so I put up, oh you know, and there was a social, something social responsibility to it. So I put up where I got mugged because everyone should know this is maybe a dangerous stretch here. We got to maybe get a light. But um, yeah, so I sent, I sent it out and then um, the first two emails I got back from this loving list of parents was how dare you see exactly where it happened. You know, we live right across the street, you know, what you're going to lower our property values.

Speaker 3:          00:07:48       Are you selling now? Is that, is that. No, we're not selling. But it was a really weird time when people needed their property values to go up because they were trying to get bigger mortgages and pay down and do all that. And it was just like so panicky there about that, that some, you know, someone was afraid of what if a newspaper covers it and it's bad and it's so weird when one's and zero's trump humanity, you know? And in that case, that's exactly what that is. It's ones and Zeros, trump, humanity. Well yeah, in two kinds of ones and Zeros, you know, the ones and zeroes, that money now and the ones and the startup of digital technology, which I think can create a kind of a distance that feeling the impact of saying that to someone's face here. Yeah. There's a weird communication that takes place online.

Speaker 3:          00:08:40       That's you. It doesn't have any consequence, you know, you can, you can do it anonymously and there's just like these barbs that you can just send out and illogically like in, in, in ways that you would never. If you had to deal with someone one on one because you would feel it, you would look at that. You would feel the response, you would be like, why are you saying this? Like, like why? Why are you being such an asshole? But because you are anonymous, so people are just like in this unnatural communication thing. Right? But then the part that worries me after that is if you get used to doing it like that in an anonymous way online, just to start to make the behavior a bit more normative when you're even with your identity. Oh, I guarantee it has to. It has to. There's, there's no free rides when it comes to that.

Speaker 3:          00:09:26       I, I really feel like your thoughts, you're kind like, there was always a thing. I remember when I was in high school, this was someone in my school newspaper wrote like a funny critique about the boy scouts and one of the things that he didn't like about the boy scouts was that they wanted you to keep your thoughts pure. I, he was like, you know, well my thoughts are my own thoughts, you know, as long as I don't do anything, I don't think there's anything wrong with my thoughts. Right. And that was really smartly argued. I remember reading that going, wow, this kid's pretty clever. But then I thought about, I'm like, but you, if you're thinking about creepy shit, you probably are kind of creepy, you know, and it's not going to get any better. Just, you know, you're just gonna eventually one day going to snap and then going to do something.

Speaker 3:          00:10:08       Maybe thing. Yeah. If you really are like the, I don't know. I mean everyone has their own definition of thoughts being pure, you know, like a more lenient person might allow a lot of healthy sexual things and the idea of thoughts being pure as long as it's not creeping. But there's other people that would just sit around and say, well, let me just think about creepy shit all day and not do it and I'm fine, but there's no free ride. There may be though you think. Well, I mean what you're describing like you're describing is you know, the benefits of an absolute police state as long as it was always right. No, that's no problem. You know, that's the problem. I mean, you can always get your, my narrative report, you know, just maybe they're running really subscribing that. I'm just saying that you've been, you can't have really shitty thoughts and get through.

Speaker 3:          00:10:53       And I think that if you're really shitty online, if you have those thoughts, even if it's only online, I really believe that negative energy genuinely shitty. I mean it's just how do you decide what's, what's shitty and whatnot. But yeah, now it's people when their demeanor you are online without your face, the meaning you can be online with your face on the meaning you can get in real life until you just got mean people. Do you investigate pupils to it? Like if someone sends you something weird on twitter, do you go to their twitter page and see just all their country shit that they write to everybody and go, oh, they're just crazy guy. I will admit I focus way more on the content tweets and emails and things and on the ones that are 10 emails. Oh, your book was great. Oh, I love it. You've changed my life. My children worship at your altar. He was like, delete, delete, delete, delete. With this guy.

Speaker 3:          00:11:48       Yes, this is the biggest piece of Shit I've ever read, but I need 10,000 people. Loved it more than life itself, but I'll spend the rest of my week trying to convince this one guy. Oh No, you don't. I am not a bad guy. Why? The book is actually okay. You gotta learn the Internet well now. Well, it's inevitable. It's hard. It's hard not to engage people because they're like a person saying it to you. It's very similar and to have someone who's public, you know you're out there, you have your, your name is out there in the videos are out there. Anyone can find out about you and see you. They can reach you to and reaching you on twitter. You know, they can send you some shitty thing just to get a arise from you and then they're just making you dance and you're dancing dancing's to someone else's spell. So you've got to learn how to just look at yourself and go, does this make sense?

Speaker 3:          00:12:40       And be able to leave it, but you've got to be able to do that to the point where where it's healthy and not beyond. Yes. At some point, if everybody's going to wake up, your bug needs to be this. When it's, you know, you've got, you can do this, but you can't do that. I, well, in the end of the sale, the market would tell me. I guess the market will tell you, but you're not a dumb guy. You'd never do that. Never make a book like that. That was so often out of line. You would look at yourself along the way down. I can tell him talking to you for 10 minutes. You're not that Kinda guy, but the kind of guy that would do that, it's like there's certain people that are functional, crazy and they can like figure some things out and chase some things down and then they'll get stuck in some sort of a weird Rut and you can't talk them out of it and you know, you realize, oh, he was crazy all the time.

Speaker 3:          00:13:27       He just figured out how to get through life. You know? Those are the ones that will go off on crazy tangents and people go, what are you doing? Because the guy wasn't really nuts in the first place. You're not nuts, man. You don't have to worry about that. Just need to keep people around you to keep telling you you're not insane. I can. I think there's a good thing that comes from criticism though, because it's even really harsh criticism is because if they're ridiculous and if you look at what they're saying, if it's ridiculous and mean and it really reveals far more about them than it really does about you, but look at what they're saying and is there any merit to it at all? Does it make any sense or is it just nonsense? It's just a guy being an asshole or if you weren't, you could you find merit in it?

Speaker 3:          00:14:12       Like I've found criticism from the biggest assholes, but it was like there was like a hair of accuracy into it. It made me reconsider certain things. I mean, in the most valuable thing about it. For me, it's entertaining. It to some extent is just. It makes me, it makes me more flexible. You know, as a, as a thinker, you know, if you can wrap your head around, you know, Oh, where am I wrong? It can make you a little indecisive because it's like, well, he's right and he's also write this, but sometimes things are complicated. I know, but that's the whole. That's, you know, for me, the object of the game, that's why I keep writing. I'm writing about that now, present, being present. If you're actually present, you have to be present with yourself and be president who you're with and that's the thing that everybody looks to be avoiding one way or another, you know, whether, whether they're doing it cold because I got to earn money or they're doing it because they got to check a device.

Speaker 3:          00:15:04       I mean there's the constant assessing and it's just. I see so few people. I walk into rooms now and I feel like I don't feel like I'm in a room with these people. There's no sort of social cohesion in. They're not really present. They're each in their own little segment, you know, connected with the internet or friends. Yeah. And then not connected with, with each other. You know, I, I am, you know, I'm a net fan. I've been since the late eighties. I've been, you know, pro bling bling or cyberpunk type person. But, you know, I keep feeling like rather than using these things to, to reach out to other people and connect, you know, we're using these things for business. They've gotten super aggressive, behavior's gotten way worse. And I don't even think it's our fault. I honestly think it's in these cases, it's because we're living on this, this, uh, uh, an operating system, but an economic operating system that just needs to feed off the net when it's, should be our space, not the economy space.

Speaker 1:          00:16:06       Yeah. It's, I, I feel like we're in a stage of progression for this interconnectivity progression where we're starting off with, you know, we were starting off with just regular telephones and that is moved to cellular phones, which everybody carries, which is going to move into some google glasses type thing which is going to eventually, I mean, down the line, if you extrapolate 100 years or whatever it's going to take. There's gonna be some really crazy interconnectivity that people share. And I think this stage that we're going through right now, the anonymous stage of being able to like make a twitter account or some fake name and just start saying mean things to random people like that ability is going to go away. You're not going to have this anonymous portal like I, I just think if you look at the way things, I feel like the way I look at the future, it's like the thing that's going to be really scarce is secrets. I think we're going to be able to connect with each other in some way that we probably can't even imagine right now. Whether it's some neuro chip or something that you embed in your body, whether it's nanotechnology, whatever it is. There's gonna come a day where we're like completely

Speaker 3:          00:17:16       each other. But the beauty of that though is if it really worked, it would bring us back to the now that we've been avoiding all this time with a face to face live interaction where you can't fuck with each other because you're here. You know there's this guy, strange way to look at it. Yeah, I met this guy, this show guy, I'm a stage magician guy who could tell when people are lying. I don't know if you've ever seen this guy. He's like worked for the FBI and stuff and he can like, he does all these tricks. He lines up 10 people and he says, okay, one of you think and he, he can really tell period when people go online and I was thinking if he can tell that people are lying because he's got this talent, it means that on some level we all know we all have that ability, right?

Speaker 3:          00:17:57       So we all on some level know when the other one's lying to us. So it's kind of been, if you're actually in the moment, it's all exposed anyway. Yeah, I think there's a weird feeling that you get when someone's being deceptive. There's a weird feeling you get where you're like, there's a sense of disturbance when you're communicating with them, you this, but you can't put it into tangible. There's nothing you could say, oh, it was x amount of weight. So here I know this is a real thing. You know, here, I'll put it on a scale, it's, but there's some weird thing that happens when you, when you're with someone, like you can tell if someone's upset at you and not saying it. They can be saying all the right words, but you're like, there's a certain, there's a coldness or a lack of warmth or there's a little something I wrote about the women in a.

Speaker 3:          00:18:42       what's it called? The housewives of Orange County. I got obsessed with them because they were just having all of these awful disagreements all the time. They, the communications guy. I'm trying to figure out what, why is there communication breaking down and so this is what I do. So I know. So I concluded in the end that is because they've put so much botox in their faces that they can't actually execute facial expressions in an honest way anymore in a way that the other person organically can react to. My God. These women in trying to kind of freeze time at age 29 ended up making themselves inaccessible to the now that they're in, because you know, you see one, they'll say, oh, you know, my, you know, my daughter, I think she might have cancer, and the other one like, oh, I haven't been in a smile. Right?

Speaker 3:          00:19:32       So then we go to the first. She said, I can't believe I told her my daughter has cancer. And the other one she says she's sorry, but I can tell she's not of. I mean that's just a metaphor, but that's true. They're like stuffing cotton in their mouth and they can't. You can't understand what they're saying right there. They're ruining the facial communication expressions of facial communication is we live in the woods shooting poison in their face to freeze it, but they're to freeze it in time is that they're trying to stop time and that's like A. I understand the urge to stop time, but when you stop time, you lose the moment. That's kind of the whole point. I'm making second the net. It can stop time in a certain way, but you're going to lose certain moments that you know, so I'm all for being on the net and having a net moment, but you know, even here, you know, I've heard you do those ads before for those sponsors and you could just cut and paste, you know, you could cycle seven of them and maybe people wouldn't even know. It's the same ones. You know, you could cut and paste from another show and throw it in. But you decide, no, I'm actually going to sit here and read these three ads with my friends. Well, if I didn't do that, I'd be really bored. I never want to just read an ad. So we always do it that

Speaker 1:          00:20:48       way. We've always money you make. And the model of the industrial age of course is to make print out more. Yeah. And the only way we would, the only way we could even do any of this stuff, the way we're doing this because we don't have anybody that we have to approve it with. You know, knowing that I don't have to go to NBC and say, Hey, this is what we're thinking of doing. I know you have these commercials but we're just going to talk shit and occasionally we'll get to the point of the commercial, but, but ironically on the long run it ends up making more money, certainly more money for the people who are actually doing it. You know, maybe by the other system you can make more total money, but it's going to go to, you know, God knows what does that mean institution.

Speaker 1:          00:21:25       Anyway, so, so the fact that it is that it is live and it is a what an MP3. Mainly it is mainly a podcast you think on the first hand, because I'm looking to do make her kind of radio choice myself and it's like, well I can do this for the man and make this amount of money kind of guaranteed, but I'm going to have to stay between these site lines and I can go to this other road and actually do the thing I do. You know, there's not even a choice. They're not in this day and age. It's not necessarily, it's they used to be a time where you would have to choose, well, this internet thing, who knows if it's gonna work out, but that's crazy like you, you have an option to immediately jump in and get a gigantic group of people that are going to start retweaking and tweeting and listening to your stuff and you'll, you'll develop a giant following in no time.

Speaker 1:          00:22:15       And as that's happening, all you're doing is you're selling ads for companies that you actually believe in. You. You could. That's the only way you should do it. Fuck working for some company that tells you not to swear or not to do this or not to discuss that or you know, that's not the stance we're taking on is particularly complicated issue. No, fuck that. That's the enemy of real thought. The enemy of real thought, his committee, you know, I don't know what you're really thinking. Everything you say has to go through a committee before it comes out of your mouth. I want to know what the fuck you're thinking. And, and especially in, in the sense of a radio show, you know, guy on the radio, that's the whole thing. It used to be like, even Djs, they used to be, this Dj likes this music, so this sauce or broadcasting from the same city, that urn, that clear channel took over and it was like, oh my gosh, we're getting a recording that's done by computer miles away.

Speaker 1:          00:23:11       This is my local rock and roll stations goes Jack Fms, which is essentially like playing shuffle when you're on your ipad. Just, you know, it could be anything of a number of things that they approve and they pretend we're wacky. We just don't have any rules. Like, Oh, we're Jack FM and that's like a standard model. There's like 100 Jack's across the country and probably even more than that. It's weird. I think radio's completely on its way out. I think they're fucked. I think that's like a, it's a silly way to do it and no one's going to stick with it after a while. Like why you're going to have Internet access in your car within no time. That's a, that's easy. They could do that right now I already get that with podcasts on the iphone because I have my iphone bluetooth to my car, so I'll just immediately say, oh, I'd like to listen to a Duncan trussell podcast and inner.

Speaker 1:          00:24:00       I've done it at a red light where it's so easy at a red light. It's one to Dunkin donuts. Boom. There is the one aspect of radio that I feel like I would miss. Is that local terrestrial, the reality of it, I guess. I mean, yeah, we could still have, I, you know, you can have an, a la channel and I could have a, you know, this part in New York channel and you know, we could do that technically with digital, you know, where you'd pick your, your so called regional thing. It'll be local stuff, but the medium is not biased towards that. The medium is, it's all equivalent, you know, and I wonder would we drift further away from, from local and kind of the things that matter to us in the here and now or um, you know, will we choose that stuff? I think, you know, instead of like a local radio station, you're going to have a million people in la making their own music, making their own, putting their own shit out there that you can choose from, you know, whether it's a music list, like a Pandora list or something like that someone puts together or whether it's podcasting.

Speaker 1:          00:25:10       I just think the idea of a local representative was always gross and it was always grows wolf man. Jack was always gross because for every Wolf Man Jack, there's a million other dudes. It probably had interesting ideas as well and they had no outlet. So you have one guy has this outlet from this particular time. That's crazy that that idea sucks. The I, the idea that we're dealing with now is way better. It's like a billion outlet, 6 billion outlets and, and there's no local anymore. There's people that are in that town that'll tell you about things, but everyone's more connected than ever before. And because they are, I mean the economy as we know, it also has to go away to, you know, they're 26 billion people doing podcasts. I mean, you've got 2 billion left doing farming. It's like, did all the businesses go and you also lose those iconic figures like the wolf man Jack or like Howard stern or like the mate?

Speaker 1:          00:26:04       Well, I mean, I think you could still choose. You would just have major every once in a while something major would happen. Right. But it wasn't, it wouldn't be, wouldn't be that one guy who's your town's Guy. You know, when I grew up in Boston, it was Charles Laquidara, Charles Laquidara. And the big mattress was like this. He would call this morning show. It's called the big mattress. It was a great guy. Lockwood era. Really Nice Guy. Met Him to eventually put he, um, he, his, he was like the number one radio DJ in Boston. Everybody knew it. You would go to, when I was doing construction and go to job sites, people would turn up or turn on the big mattress, listen to Lockwood era. And it was, that was a show. It was like that was shell. And the only

Speaker 3:          00:26:44       way to get a show like that, it's, and not have a lot of options. You know, to have a show that everybody agrees we're all gonna listen to, you know, it's kind of the only like three options. No disco, no, we're not listening to this go, you know, there wasn't like the Internet quality options that, that, that changes the whole game. Like there's never going to be a CBS radio on the Internet and it does. It will. And it's going to replace everything terrestrial, I mean on every sense. So if you're saying, we're saying everything's going to be replaced, everything terrestrials going to be replaced first it's radio, then it's other stuff. All we have to make sure then is before we lose all those things, which we're going to inevitably lose to say to ourselves, what is, what is it we value about those things that we want to bring into these digital things before we're untethered in there.

Speaker 3:          00:27:34       You know, before it's all the way. Yeah. Well we want our cake and we want to eat it too. We want the digital era and we still want mom and pop stores. We're trying to like keep it all together. And that's the question is can you get both, you know, so can you have this, you know, very traditional narrative, 20th century industrial age culture live right aside, you know, this sort of steady state economy and peer to peer currencies and local CSA as you know, can we have an iphone and organic chard and no slavery in Africa to get either. Yeah. Is that possible open? So we moved towards it or not, you know, it seems like that's what a great percentage of the world would like. But it's, we've made shackling little progress and moving towards that potentially utopia. Right. But then, but you know, as long as we got a hope or try to envision that would say okay, but, but this shift that we're undergoing now from an analog era to a digital one is a bigger shift than just than just that there's a whole different digital media environment that we've gone into.

Speaker 3:          00:28:44       So we've gone into this from this. This time is money expansionist economy live by the clock universe to one that's potentially asynchronous. That's just off that off that day. I remember when the net first came up, it was like, it was, you know, people in Austin and slackers and cyber punks. The idea was that the net was going to give us more slack, you know, and it's ended up for most people kind of doing the opposite because they're always on and working and being monitored and all that and distracted. But I mean, I think if we, if we, uh, take command of the way we're programming these things, then we can use them to sort of, to create, you know, the gorgeous culture, slack to create, you know, what a few of us are, are kind of discovering we can do like you're doing with this, right?

Speaker 3:          00:29:34       You're just doing your thing. Yeah. I think we're trying to resist the inevitable and that inevitable is the symbiotic computer relationship. There's going to be some sort of bio mechanical connections as when men talking to another man with that funds to a million people listening in their car or wherever the fuck they are asynchronous. I really don't feel like we can stop that. It seems like the things that we got so excited by as as these higher functioning primates are these new things that we've created that input us or give us input in a way that our bodies completely not designed to to get like through your ear phones, like like listening to a podcast like the computer itself, the ability to watch a video, the ability to go to the movies. It's all good. This is the stimuli that's coming at us. It's just we're not designed for it, but it's.

Speaker 3:          00:30:28       But it's. It's reconfiguring itself to be as seductive as possible. Well, because it's not what it's for, right? It's to seduce us into itself so that the companies behind it can make money and because we moved constantly in to in a path of progression, and if you look at the technology, it's always going to move into a stronger grip. We were never satisfied with any particular result at any particular time. More choices. Yeah. We want more choices. We want it to be powerful more fast. We want, we want better graphics, we want bigger boobs. That's not realistic enough. Let's take it to the next level. It's, it's in this desire to get these experiences were pushing the technology. Like ultimately that's what's getting. What's interesting to me about that is while all that's pushing ahead, what we get in a digital media environment is we ended up retrieving weird medieval values.

Speaker 3:          00:31:22       You know, you get burning man and etsy and people doing peer to peer stuff, trying to have their local currencies, which they haven't had since medieval times. You know, you see the stuff that gets her treatment, paganism, men and uh, you know, mashing up a route to heal yourself of things, maker culture. All these things are what we've lost over the last thousand years. That's what the renaissance and the industrial age was about. You know, stamping that out and putting everybody on the, on the assembly line at Ford. So it's fun that as we move forward, we get these great old recurrences, which to me is reassuring. It means that we are bringing something with us into, into this next place. I think it's also that the current system is so flawed that people are willing to try anything and that they're actually actively thinking about what can we do differently?

Speaker 3:          00:32:14       Can we make a local local currency? Like you got to know him, which is interesting because like the two places I've gotten emails from him the last many years of people doing social currency, sorry, either from a place like Ithaca, New York where they're doing it because they're just, you know, strange and trying to try something weird and good. Or like Lansing Michigan where there's no GM plant, there's no bank that's going to give money to a factory to open up to hire people and they're desperate. They're like, well, I've got skills. I know how to fix a fridgerator and they have needs, so can't we just make an economy that way? You know, those are the places where people are actually asking the, the, the where they're ready. I just don't like that. Readiness seems to involve being just so I'm not just fed up but uncomfortable. You know, that you've got to do something.

Speaker 3:          00:33:00       Yeah. We're clearly going through change. We're clearly going through a change as a culture that we weren't prepared for and we're sort of making our way as we go along and there's a lot of mistakes along the way and the evidence that points to it. One of the best pieces as your story about people getting upset at you because you got mugged and called in the story and said the location. That's one of the best examples of people like losing the script like along the way in this crazy thing that we're doing where we developed currency and and then there's things called property values and those mortgages and equity and all this crazy shit along the way. You know, we're going to have to figure out how to, how to stay human and when you see like instant failure, like, oh my God, I got mugged.

Speaker 3:          00:33:47       You fucking asshole. What are you? Why'd you say the place? It's interesting. I made it in every single one of my books and I've written like 12 now. You know, they're, they're all finally about how do we bring humanity into this thing that seems to have lost it. So I did it for, you know, for, for business, I did it for, for the economy with Life Inc is the book you're talking about did it for Judaism, something called nothing sacred. St Judaism should be this ongoing conversation. Keep it alive, keep it human, don't let it lock down. And now this one, it's weird because it's like I'm kind of admitting that it's what I guess I'm realized it myself, but I'm kind of saying, oh my gosh, I'm a humanist. No, I'm a humanist and a technology enthusiast hadn't how do you be both because so many of the other folks who are sort of pro technology, sort of my posse and they're all sort of talking about not human beings being enabled by technology but technology surpassing us, you know, some singularity or you know, some, some moment in the future where computers get smarter than us and then we're not really needed anymore.

Speaker 3:          00:34:52       It might not be that simple. I'm a, I've been thinking about it a lot lately and one of the things I think is why do we have this idea of competition and why would the computer enjoy that idea with us? Our idea is based entirely on our biological makeup, our need to reproduce or need to prove ourselves to our mate or need to protect against strangers. All these instincts that a computer's not going to have at home. So the idea of competition with humans for resources or the even the idea that survival is imperative and that you know, you, you, you have an ego and you can't die, they're not going to have any of that. So why would they be in competition with us? Why wouldn't it just be like any new? It wouldn't be because of them. It'd be because of the program. The program

Speaker 1:          00:35:39       though that that's really wouldn't do the bad thing. Okay. So why not keep us around, but it doesn't matter. I don't even not. It's not a matter of them being able to do that because I don't even think they will. I don't think they can. It's more a matter of people in the here and now saying that human beings are really only important insofar as we can be the shepherds and organizers of information. Information is the thing that's evolving towards greater states of complexity and once human beings are no longer the best at making complex information, but computers are the best at it, then there's just no need for humans anymore with the computers kill us or not. I don't know what they give us a good time, who knows? But, but the, just the whole idea that we should be developing technology with this in mind.

Speaker 1:          00:36:24       Um, I dunno it, it negates what I think is an essential for us anyway, centrality of humanity in the equation. While I think people don't recognize how much we need each other, we don't recognize how important positive interaction is with other people to your health and the way you feel about life. There's clearly a relationship that people have to each other that were in denial about the lock ourselves up in our apartments or our homes. And we shut our car doors and we rolled down the window and that's one of the reasons why people are willing to give people the finger when they're in the car. He would never do that in real life. You feel like you're in some sort of a contained world and even though you're not even anonymous, who still like, fuck you, you know how many people do give the fan in real life?

Speaker 1:          00:37:09       Like nobody. But once a year I'll give somebody the finger. Somebody does something crazy and they beep at me. Fuck you. Fuck you. It's beautiful. It's a beautiful thing to do. But you know that eventually I think we have to accept the fact that we were only happy when the people around us are happy, when we're in harmony with the people around us were not happy. When we're in conflict, we're not happy. When, when we're not happy, when we fuck people over. Like I know people that have done bad things in business and bad things ethically and bad, you know? And they're not happy. No. But then in the current culture they can compensate for that with medicine. Say that type of presence that gets them through the night, like you have to hope. I mean, I always do, which is to vain hope. I hope that the people who do bad stuff but then make up for it with drugs still feel worse than I do.

Speaker 1:          00:38:02       Not taking those drugs and trying to do good stuff and you don't want to believe that, you know, these kind of guys I used to see, um, I won't even say his name, one of those millionaires down at Knicks Games and I had always think, I sure hope he's not happy. That's fine, isn't very fair. But a while hold he's doing is playing some really crazy game that was around before he was ever born. He just got into it and got really good at it. The game itself, it's bananas, just the stock market itself. Just the idea that the wealth of, of, of a person can vary day by

Speaker 3:          00:38:35       day because of confidence, you know, confidence, computer, consumer confidence in a product can shift and change with recall. And then watching these numbers go up and down like what the fuck are you even talking about? Most of the explanations you see, you know, I watched these business sites and the market will go down and they say, oh mark it down because of such and such in London. And then it's like, by the time that piece comes out that markets actually back up and they're already constructing their, you know, let's tie market going back up to another random feature. You know, it's like the, the, the explanations after the fact to have so little to do with whatever. Some algorithm decided it was going to suddenly ultra fast trade something and throw the stock up. You know, it's like at this point it's, it truly is.

Speaker 3:          00:39:18       That's the best place to see humans combating machines on the market where it's like there's human traders competing with these programmed algorithms and the algorithms are certainly winning the war. And if you look at their screens while they're, while they're doing it, it is almost like code. Like the average person who doesn't understand it, doesn't know what the fuck the stock market saying the symbols. And the essay, Oh, and this and that and the ones and the Zeros. You look at all that, you have no idea what that is. I mean, how is that really different than a computer code that you're reading me that's essentially like a, a way that people are, are, are, are, are tapping into this bizarre system. I mean it was at one time the sort of the price of something had to do with some thing. It's like there's a factory, oh it's factory went slower today in the rain.

Speaker 3:          00:40:01       The market will go down on that. It was like real, you know? And I think it's gotten certainly further and further from whatever is going on in that company or their earnings are the things, you know, it's, it's absolutely abstracted to the point now where people don't even invest in companies, right? You invest in something like when facebook went public, people bought it at like nine in the morning at like nine, 10. They're all pissed off that it hasn't gone up. It's like, wait a minute, I was supposed to my well my wealth. It's like, no, you don't. You don't make money on the trade, you're supposed to make money on when you've, when you've done it, but now we've got, you know, derivatives and derivatives of derivatives and derivatives of derivatives, of derivatives on there, which is just a way of kind of shrinking the. Explain that for people don't know what that means. So if you buy a stock, I mean, you know, you buy stock and hope it goes up and then you sell it in the future. If you'd rather make up that time right now, I can sell it in the future right now, right? I can basically sell that future sale because I think that sales is going to be a good one now. Right? I can say, what if I did that trait? I'm gonna, I'm gonna. I'm gonna have it now, but

Speaker 3:          00:41:10       one of I trading, then I'm trading. I'm trading on, on an abstraction from what something's going to be worse at some moment in the future. So it's like I'm trading on the stock over time and then someone else will say, well, I'm going to trade on the abstraction of that. I'm going to trade on whether or not people think the stock in the future is going to be worth more next minute. Then this minute it's like, well, what's that? So basically what you're doing is you're buying stock over time, over time, over time. Over time, you're creating these things, these derivatives of whatever the original investment was, which is kind of just a derivative of the thing, right? There's the pork belly, this derivative, the pork belly derivatives, and the derivatives. Derivatives of derivatives, of the derivatives, of the derivatives, all, all ever tighter ways of saying what is pork belly going to be worth, you know, on February third, why is that legal?

Speaker 3:          00:41:58       Well, it's legal because what it. Because the economy requires it, right? We have a kind of money, right? That has a clock in it. It's lent into existence and has to be paid back more than got lent out. So our economy needs to expand by hook or by Crook. Somehow it has to grow in order for it to survive. That's just the way central currency works. They need to find more surface area for the money. More ways for people to buy stuff. So instead of just having, there's not enough of a company to buy, so now we can bet on how that company's going to do in some future date. We can bid on that or we can bet on that. Right. But what we're really doing is trying to kind of compress all of this time, right onto like the head of a pin so we can bet on that.

Speaker 3:          00:42:42       So I don't have to sit and wait, you know, 3000 years for facebook to be worth something I can trade on his future worth now. But the whole joke of that is people who are trading that way, there are these computers that are trading faster than them. So I put in one of my super fast, crazy, you know, um, derivative trade. Goldman Sachs sees that order coming in on the computer. They're so close to the exchange, they can execute an order before my order even goes through based on having seen that I was going to do what I'm going to do. So they can literally trade in my future. Right. I am in their past though. That's, that's digital time shifts. That sounds like it's cheating. That's like someone running a quick server and they're local and then you have like 150 paying. Exactly. That's bullshit.

Speaker 3:          00:43:29       I think so. It will be so bullshit. The irony of it is it's gotten so big, right? Derivative trading is bigger than regular trading, so the New York Stock Exchange actually just got bought. The exchange itself got bought by its derivative exchange, so it's almost just like the proof's in the pudding. It's like the derivative owns the market at this point, but that's allowed that how. How could the government even ever deny how incompetent they are when they allowed that, like that alone to like someone should just have a broadcast on national television, a one of those town hall sort of events where you sit down with the main people that run the country and go, how the fuck are you allowing this? How? How will you, if not, fix this. Why would you ever try to do anything else before you fix this? When they made the decision, they genuinely thought it would be good for business in the short term.

Speaker 3:          00:44:27       I will never understand. Big business people promise them, figure it out before it got really bad. Oh my God, we'll figure it out before it got really bad. How much bigger is the derivative economy? I don't know exactly. I mean it seemed. I was looking, trying to find out what the, what the sort of trading was. It seemed, from what I could tell, like 94 percent of trades are now derivative because they're in because they're. Because there's such a bigger volume, so that's insane. No one's gonna like, you're not going to buy 10,000 shares of Honeywell today because that's, you know, you know, whatever. $60,000 or something. But you could buy like 10,000 futures on Honeywell because they're, oh really? Gee God, that is so crazy. Percent of the trades are. And how many more? It's, I think it's ultra fast. Two is a whole other.

Speaker 3:          00:45:21       There's sort of two different. Two different realms. But yeah, to huge. They must all be crazy. Everyone involved in the must know that they're bringing on the matrix. They must know that they're there. They're the first steps before the digital machine takes over. They must know. They must know that there's no humanity in that stock market. Shit. That's chaos and, and again, I don't want digital technology to get blamed for this, right? Because the real operating system they're promoting is not the digital operating system. It's the economic operating system underneath it. It's this 13th century central currency interest bearing, debt based economy, and none of the guys who I thought we'd get us out, you know Evan Williams with twitter, Mark Zuckerberg, with facebook, the kids from Google, right? They're getting the. Each of them had a real shot. Even Bill Gates at breaking the central economy and and flipping things the other way.

Speaker 3:          00:46:14       Not going, not going public, not be good, not doing it with venture capital. Saying if I can, if, if Google can hack web search, if facebook can hack social, if twitter can hack everybody, why can't they? If they're so busy disintermediating all these different things, why doesn't anyone of them yet want to disintermediate central banking and say, no, Mr. Chase, we don't actually need you. We're gonna do our whole thing through kickstarter. Say like one of your didn't want to hear things. Yeah. That's an interesting point of view. I think they probably would never want to take that stand because they would be killed. I would imagine there's a lot of money in, uh, in, in them not being successful with that quest, you know, to the point at which, you know, you're doing paper, okay, we're gonna let people do individual transactions. That was their original model and they were going to make money on the float and then the banks came to them and said, ah, you're not allowed to do that.

Speaker 3:          00:47:13       You're not a bank paypal kids. You've got to be, you know, can I just start as a bank or you're going to have to be connected to one of us and that's when, you know, pay pal kind of becomes part of Ebay rather than whatever these crazy guys might've done. And I suppose there's this point where, you know, innocently these companies that get bigger and bigger and bigger, hoping to do the right things, and then it's like, we're gonna, we're not gonna let you do this if you don't, if you don't play by our rules. But uh, I also feel like there's companies that if you, if you're willing to go smaller, if you're willing to let it grow a little bit slower, that you can scale up, you can become a big ethical corporation. Yeah. Yeah. I was always wondering why a big corporation couldn't be ethical.

Speaker 3:          00:47:58       Why? Why can't you have a big corporation with a, a good ideology behind it? But I think it's really because of shareholders and shareholders are inpatient. Shareholders are there. They're not really there, right? They're distant. They're shareholders are, are people who just want to see a number go up by the next quarter. And if you have to make a number go up by the next quarter, then you're going to have to be thinking about something other than doing good in the world. You if it is ones and Zeros at all costs, if that's the game you're playing and if you've got shareholders, then you're going to throw you in jail. If you don't do that, I mean that's your fiduciary responsibility and it's a fascinating thing that a corporation can do something that an individual would be a total piece of shit to do. If it was one person that was involved in this one guy, what he did was he, you know, he gave the loans to the Third World Company, the countries that they couldn't pay back.

Speaker 3:          00:48:51       He went over there, monopolize our natural resources himself, dug the oil, lie himself, polluted the river himself, you know, raped and killed the villagers himself. He'd be like, Jesus Christ locked that fucking guy in jail. He's making people work for $5 a week. You know that guy. There he is there he is holding down, you know, but because it's a corporation, you're like, well, they're making money for their. Exactly. And how many people who on the one hand, you know, we'll read a good magazine or something or listen to us and, and NPR and, and be all sad about that stuff. Still has a 401k plan with stocks in the very companies that are doing those things. So they're the ones who actually own the company. They're the shareholder who wants to think to go up so they could send their kid to college. You know, I mean it's, it's, it's interesting how circular it gets.

Speaker 3:          00:49:36       So I mean, for, for how unvirtuous that circle is though, I think unwinding it is just, is just as easy. So it's like, okay, instead of doing these sort of long distance, longterm disconnected investments in mining companies, I'm going to invest my money where I see it and people actually know in the place where I am, who are trying to do something, you know, and bring it, bring it, if not, uh, if not local, at least at least into your present, at least into your, into your visible reality. Yeah. And it really is the, the, the pursuit of the end goal of simply only ones and zeros done through a corporate way is really anti human. I mean that's the, that's the real anti human aspect of it is that it will engage human suffering as long as it's willing to extract ones and zeroes from that elected calculates how much human suffering are we willing to cause, how much devastation to the environment or are we willing to cross so much, you know, which is why.

Speaker 3:          00:50:34       Then the question becomes, I mean in the nightmare scenario then is you invest that into technology so that your robots, no, they're not in competition with us, but they are playing the corporate program. They have no desire other than to extract, extract value and meaning from it. And those computers running algorithms recognize trends in the marketplace before a human could ever see it coming. And then round countered. And meanwhile, as we're making ourselves dumber about technology or I'm wearing this code academy tee shirt, right? Want people to learn to code. As we become more stupid about our computers, our computers are getting smarter about us doing big data repositories of every. Every keystroke, right? Every are there. They know, they know stuff about, I think knew some teenage girl was pregnant before family did and you know, they know when kids are going to be gay before they know themselves, you know, it's like things got really smart and I.

Speaker 3:          00:51:32       You go to a google when you google something or look for things, certain things online and then say you go to youtube and there's ads for things that you've recently looked at is scary. Tantalizing ads. Oh I see you're into jeeps. Why we have a jeep for sale and it's a new jeep and here's a video you can click on and their ab testing that you know, understand which is which he reacted last girl or not girl and cheap correlation. Okay. Give him that next time. Tits, tits. Like they'll show you everything that you're into and you like you son of a bitch. How do you know about all this? It's weird and it's just the beginning. We're accepting it slowly accepting the needle and to our vein pumps in nano cells that eventually replace human tissue. If there's going to be a commercial is going to be an artificial guys is going to be saying why would you want to be natural? You're going to rot. It's not fun. Life gets even better as you get a buyer buyer little nanobots to from like the most reputable company, you know, the one that you really like and the great user agreement. And then, but then after it's in you, it's like they get bought by google and all of a sudden your user agreement shifted, you know, agree to, you know, do you want to have, you know, uh, do you want to remember your children's names? Okay. Then sign that's used this new user agreement.

Speaker 3:          00:52:53       Otherwise you get no's. No data. You have enough for two people to phone numbers. Your emergency 911 phone, like your phone. It's not registered at only relate to call nine. One one. That'll be the same thing. Well, you should've paid your bill, Mr Rushkoff. I don't know why he didn't want to pay your bill and here you are with no recourse. Yeah, you're going to look at a shiny guy from the future of thousand years old and it looks great, but again, it'd be all artificial. Yeah, but again, it's not with all that artificial knees. It's not necessarily, although it may be it, it's not necessarily the technology that's the problem in this equation. You're the company that owns the technology, right, but ultimately what's getting done, the technology's getting pushed. That seems to be the case in every single situation and ultimately at the top of the execution food chain where you look at like what is being done at the end level.

Speaker 3:          00:53:47       That's really the game changer. The technology constantly increases with every overtake, with every new gigantic invention and bundles of money that go along with it and all the people that got fucked over. At the end of the day, the technology keeps moving forward and it keeps getting stronger and stronger and stronger and it's. But it's not just stronger that it's, it's, it's fundamentally different. I mean, that's the thing that Mcluhan was trying to bring up in Marshall Mcluhan, the media theorist. He was looking at that, the different environments that different media, different kinds of technology create. So you know, fire had a change. They had a media environment, had a technological environment with fire. Now you know, people could go live further north in colder places and little apes, you know, who were smart enough to have fire, could get away from big dumb apes who couldn't travel north to chase them.

Speaker 3:          00:54:34       You know, we got different races and all sorts of things happen because it's sounding like fire or the invention of text or the invention of text changed. Well for me it changed the way we look at time, right? Because now I can write something now that I'm going to be accountable for later. So we can have contract with text. We got history, we got the Judeo Christian line of thought. We got law and ethics, you know, we got our, we got the calendar, you know, then that all went along and we developed. Then we get the printing press and we get the clock right now, the clock, all of a sudden we go, oh wow. Now we can actually break down the day into these little pieces. We put one up at the town square and that's when time became money. That's what it was like, okay, now you can work for an hour for me instead of making a thing that you're connected to and selling it to me, now you can work for the hour or two hours or three hours.

Speaker 3:          00:55:21       We got to standard and now we get the digital media environment, you know, which is just as different as the industrial age media environment. That. And the clock was from the printing press, from the written text, from, from, uh, from even fire. You know, and in the digital media environment, there's this, uh, it's not just more tech, it's, it's more, it's more of a sense of, of moving through time and a choice. Two choice, two choice two choice way. You know, where we just have more choices than we know what to do if we spend more time processing choice itself than we do. Getting the things that we've chosen, you know, it's like the call waiting is almost like the typical kind of digital choice. It just ended our, I'm talking to this level and I've got a call waiting. What do I do? You know, just to be put in that, just to be put yourself in that, in that interrupted state is very digital because you want to have the choice because that person wants to reach you.

Speaker 3:          00:56:16       But how, you know, how that interrupts what, uh, what used to be a more continuous way of, of just moving through life. Yeah. It, it certainly gives us more options and we're naturally designed to handle. And the more people have on their facebook page, the more likely they really have zero connection to those people. The, the idea. I mean like, like we're, we're designed for Dunbar's number, right? One hundred 50 people and you get, get 5,000 people on your facebook page. Well, who the fuck does that mean? Who are you talking about marketing and you know, what, what kind of interaction that you really happening, you know, it's not the same. It's not a human to human interaction. The other weird thing that facebook for me, again, it's how it compresses time, so it's like there are these people from like second and third grade.

Speaker 3:          00:57:04       I'm finally, you know, 45, whatever years away from that and then it's like two weeks ago from second grade, it's like, God, I'd finally, I'd left that behind me. It's unmarked. Yeah. I don't know who she is. It's I was or who she relates to. It's just, it was in the past for a reason and now it's here, but then on the front end I've got the computer on the other side, calculating everything about my keystrokes so they know my future. They know who's going to be pregnant, who's going to be gay, who is going to be, this can be that. There was like, okay. So it was like my past is all in here and now my future is all in here and everything's just sort of crushed in on me there. I don't feel. I don't feel autonomous anymore. I don't feel like I have agency.

Speaker 3:          00:57:46       I don't feel I'm in charge. I can't get away from anything and I can't actually be moving towards anything with a sense of free will, but can you. I mean you're, you're sort of in control of how much to interact with it, how much you choose to use it. That's why I dropped facebook. You dropped it. I was just like, too much. But you still use twitter? Yeah. What? What's there? Stays there. Facebook problematic. Facebook is a problem that will. A real problem with facebook is I'm not in charge of what I do on facebook. Why is that? Because Mark Zuckerberg can use me or my likeness in an ad of something that I don't even know what it is. He can't do that anymore than I thought. Oh really? He undid that. I think that was something that wasn't supposed to happen. Supposedly. Are they backtracked about that?

Speaker 3:          00:58:35       They do. They go two steps forward, one step back just to forward one step back. It's sort of an ever evolving user agreement. I mean, we're the part that I had gotten concerned about what? I'm on there as an author. Right. I'm on there, buy my book. Love me. You know, and like my ideas, um, I can't do that. I can't solicit the likes of other people have readers, people who I'm supposedly a advising about this stuff, especially about sort of media ethics and integrity. I can't invite them to like my page when that very active liking is making them vulnerable to marketing, that's going to be passing through me beyond my control. Yes and no because they're also providing you with this excellent connection with all these people that's available through facebook, which not as limited as twitter with 140 characters. I'm willing to pay for the privilege to reach those people, but I'm not willing to have them and their likenesses used to represent things.

Speaker 3:          00:59:36       I don't think that they understand that. What liking makes someone vulnerable to, you know? I don't think so. I mean on some senses is patronizing. I guess what I'm saying is I think I know stuff about this technology that they don't. If they all knew really how this worked, if they all knew the implications of what they were doing, then I would say, let's, let's go for it. But ultimately the worst consequences is what marketing they're going to be marketed to going to be represented. So their image would then be put on something. Oh, so, but no, I'm pretty sure that I'm 100 percent sure they didn't. They dropped that thing of using their photos and advertising. And you're not going to profit. They're not allowed to just take your photos and just, uh, just photos. No, they're not going to do it. With your photos that you're talking about is, are you talking about the photo, the photo thing they bought? I'm talking about using, but for, you were saying like using it for advertising sponsored stories and how they use people in a sponsored story. At least the day that I quit at that point it would not.

Speaker 4:          01:00:36       Oh, you can turn that off. But yeah, that, that, that there's things like that that are on, but there's ways

Speaker 3:          01:00:40       turn them off. I'm confused. There are sponsored story, but do you mean people don't know? I feel like most people don't know and just to be there, it just didn't seem like it also because I so don't trust who they are. And what they're, what they're about. I don't trust them as a company the way I want to trust the kinds of companies I let get bigger and bigger and deeper and deeper into my lives and eventually put probes in my brain and do not trust them because Justin timberlake played him in a movie. The other one, he played a Shauna to put the good guy. No, he played the mindspace story and how much of it is about coke and horse for her, because I would have with those guys and they just take that money crazy.

Speaker 4:          01:01:20       If you're going to take facebook, if you're going to say you, I don't trust facebook. You can't trust twitter. You can't trust google. You can't trust any of the snow.

Speaker 3:          01:01:28       I'm aware right now I'm aware of the ways that twitter is broadcast. I feel in control of how I'm tweeted and retweeted. Almost

Speaker 4:          01:01:39       worse though, because they're actually to the point where you try to go back in time and your timeline. You can see there gets a cutoff point where you can't download your own tweets unless you know the exact link. Then they end up giving you your history. They said, I still can't do it on mine, and that's the same with like twit picks are all these photo ones, like some of them. Now you're saying that some inches. Okay. You're saying that you want your. If you're going to do tweets you want or should have been an addition for your free, for your free tweeting. You want them to maintain an archive of you and everyone else. Well, I'm, I, I personally, I personally don't have a problem with it, but when I'm saying

Speaker 3:          01:02:20       is that that's kind of more ridiculous to me than facebook. The fact that I can't even access stuff that I've, that I've totally different thing I'm concerned about. I mean this is what in the book I call it digit Phrenia, you know, I feel like the problem with, with digital for most people, it's not this idea of information overload, that there's too much stuff coming at them, but they're, they can't maintain more than one online persona a simultaneously. There's too many sort of individual instances of us and if you're going to have different instances of yourself, you know even your email inbox is an instance of a sort. If you're gonna have all these different different things out there filling up or interacting, you want to be damn well sure that you're in charge of each one of them and I didn't feel. I felt like facebook was now doing things on my behalf.

Speaker 3:          01:03:05       I was like one step of control. When you make a very good point in that having more than one version of yourself becomes very problematic. Especially if you're involved in any like real. I mean I'm sure you probably interact with quite a few people every day and to do that on twitter's semi manageable. Do it to do it when you can, but to do that on twitter and then they have to hop over to facebook too. It's like you should have one portal in one portal. At least one. That's one that I was always sad, you know, because I don't really. I didn't go to facebook much. I go there and they'd be like some relative, you know, who said, oh, I just heard of your mom's passing. It was like six months have gone by before I found that message. You don't want to console them or whatever.

Speaker 3:          01:03:47       Um, it's, it's just such a, it's for me, it was such an awful interface anyway that I was just losing, losing stuff there. But yeah, it's uh, I don't think it's just has to do with how I get more, uh, uh, correspondence from other people. So I've got a, I've got to limit it more than others. I think it really has to do with, um, well if anything, it's at least I'm the canary in the cage for what's coming for everybody else. I mean, you know, people will need to get one or two emails and now it's just streaming in for everybody. Yeah. If you send me something on Facebook, I don't read it just to let everybody know because they pile up. I don't have time to read them. So I'm with you in a certain way. I still use facebook to put up links, but it's connected to my twitter and I'm pretty cognizant of that.

Speaker 3:          01:04:30       So when I put a tweet up on, when I put a link up on facebook, I make sure it's short enough to fit into a tweet with, with, with, with twitter. I mean you, you understand what you're putting out, you put out this little hundred 40 things, it went to your people and those words are out there. It's like a tool like facebook. You don't really have the same sense of ownership over what's going and you don't have, you don't actually have it. Right. Your picture is used. Douglas went into starbucks just now. Yeah. I could turn it off so everyone should turn it off. So again, you know, it's like, I feel like it's a useful, it's a useful tool, but it's, it's a part of the untrustworthiness of

Speaker 1:          01:05:18       a good portion of the net. Yeah. Well, I could see that with someone else being in control of the, uh, the, the interaction and someone else being controlled ultimately of like when you sign a user agreement and you have all this information, they just sort of put up online. You're, you're entrusting it to them and then turn their marketing to you. I mean, that's a really good clean relationship as long as they don't fuck you. But yeah, I mean, and there's a point at which, you know, I'm all, I'll let Netflix and it, whoever's in behind my TV remote. I mean now they know all that stuff, right? I mean, I'll let them craft commercials around me. It's like, oh, I'll accept in this, in this little, uh, arrangement we have with business. I'll accept anything incoming, you know, but don't use me for your outgoing know.

Speaker 1:          01:06:04       Otherwise, once you're taking the person's identity and then saying, Oh, you know, alice down the street like this, a Sitcom to, you should watch that. And then my, what I'm watching is getting broadcast to them or what they think I'd be watching. That's where it starts to be like, oh, now I'm being disembodied, now I'm being taken. I think it's facebook is one of the most popular websites online and it's also one of the best ways to waste time, like you can waste a day easily just looking at people that you used to have sex with you and I'll just fire them and go, what is this picture up to? Oh my goodness, look, you know you could do that all day. You go through that all day. That could be entertained and you're not getting shit done. It's the same. It's like I try to use twitter.

Speaker 1:          01:06:50       I'm one of the things that I do with it is when we're. Whenever someone sends me something fascinating and a link, I retweet it and because of that you become like a portal for cool shit and people know that if they send me cool shit, I'll retweet it and so you get all this cool shit just starts coming to you. When you sort of have that idea and then you send it, they send it to you and then it becomes this really exponentially expanding thing where you know, you, you have this like a radio channel or, or like an information dump. What percent of the tweets that you get do you think you would pass on? Um, it's not that high percentage because it's not always filter. Well, I'll have to look at it, you know, I mean if it's really interesting I'll look at it, but sometimes they'll send you something and like, oh dude, that's nonsense.

Speaker 1:          01:07:36       Like, what are you talking? Did you see where this came from? Like you read the link, know that is not big foot and that guy's refrigerator. Shut the fuck up and stop telling me this. But what that makes you a reliable. A reliable filter. Yeah. You can't just retweet things, but I do read occasionally if someone sends something really preposterous, will retweet it. Just to see how people react. You know, there's um, or if someone, if people get mad at me, I'll retweet it just to see how they react. It just, it's just we live in strange times. It's uh, the, the, the, the twitter interface is a very bizarre one. The idea that you only give them 140 characters and people abuse the shit out of that. Sometimes people will send me like 30 tweets in a row, like explaining something to me, like to stop the, of things like snapchat.

Speaker 1:          01:08:25       You played with that or no, what is that? The one where you take a picture and it like, you can send it but it dissolves in like three seconds or five seconds. So it's like kids apparently. I mean this is the dark secret. Kids are leaving facebook, you know, the, the demographic, the younger like thing or in the 16 it's like falling totally off and they're doing things like snapchat because they don't want, they don't want to be putting everything they're doing on their permanent record. I mean they're finally kind of accepted that they can show someone they're posting. It only lasts for three minutes. You screenshot it though and then you save it, upload it. Well he knows, but if you screenshot it, it at least tells them that they've, uh, I mean, so it's been defeated, but if you screen save it, they at least the person who sent you the thing knows that you did, that they've given, given their control.

Speaker 1:          01:09:10       But yeah, but just this quest for truly uh, Julie present based non archivable silliness, but it's because when we were silly we got to do in the parking lot of the seven slash 11. It's like, and there was no camera in the back either. It was really just it. What happens in the standard seven, 11, seven, 11, you know, now it's like every single silly thing they did, if they didn't post about it, their friend posted about it. So it was still up there. And it's like, may as well. We pitched passion to the side of the Parthenon. Not only that, but the ideas behind what you can and can't do or enforced by these archaic laws that were written when none of this digital technology was available. So because of that, he get a lot of weird shit happens. Like there's one girl who got charged with child pornography because shape, she was sending photos of her naked body to boys in her class and so the cops arrested her and charged this young girl.

Speaker 1:          01:10:06       She was 15 years old with child pornography sending pictures. Yeah. I mean you talk about losing the scripts. That's, that's really losing the script for life. I mean that was, that is the nuttiest shit ever. You're, you, you, you found a child porn king pin, right. There happens to be a child. It was like, yeah, exactly. Zero tolerance son. It doesn't matter if she's a child, but her vagina doesn't matter son. She's a criminal. She's victimizing probation is rape. Exactly younger. She's feeding the dark hunger, so we need to discourage this in a big way. Solitary confinement. But that's really just a temporal lag hopefully. Yeah. So I think in our last then catch up, are we. I mean, and also, I mean in some sense a lack of privacy could help that along too. It's like if you know, if Google cameras finding like tens of thousands of people who are just smoking joints in the streets of every American city, you know, some point they have to go, okay, let people smoke pot, let gays get married.

Speaker 1:          01:11:07       Say yes, except the pod thing. There's money in enforcing it. The biggest issue, more money in enforcing it or being in selling it? No, but it would be two different people and you have to pry it from the hands of the people that are making money by keeping it illegal. Whether it's the private prison industry, whether it's the prison guards unions, whether it's different pharmaceutical companies that would stand to lose profits, whatever. There's gonna be a bunch of people that are trying to stop anything, any change, especially changes in legalities because there's a big business in locking people up for shit I know, so they're going to have to maintain a, an illegal population to stay alive. They're going to have to rest more and more if they're going to have corporate growth. Greater greater percentage of America has to be in prison every single year until it's an Asam Tata curb and there's one guy left.

Speaker 1:          01:12:00       That becomes a really interesting scenario. If marijuana does become legal and you can trade on the future of marijuana, what the fuck man, I want. It does have it. There are some stocks that are marijuana stocks really at that people trade. How is that possible? Well, they're the companies that I guess that I've already laid out a marijuana strategy or are they ready for it? Look at that percentage of the US prison population that are non violent drug offenders in the 1980 and then in 2012 percent and in 2012, it's 25 percent. Yeah, the war on drugs folks, they're winning. More people are in jail I guess is. I mean they're winning and no, as long as we have a private prison system, it's good for the economy, the whole thing. It's fucking bananas. Just the. The fact that in this day and age you still can't make a logical argument as to why certain things are legal and illegal.

Speaker 1:          01:12:59       Certain things that are legal, which are devastating to your health, and then when you find out that information has been withheld and that companies may have new known about certain risks, no one seems to go to jail if anything happens, people get find a little bit. But if that was an individual person that did that, oh my God, there would be a horrible human being, a personal person. One person who's responsible for all the deaths that came from aspirin alone. You would want to add what's. That's why there's some, there's some ways to get more conscious of it though, because it's all of us, right? It's all of us who are part of that system are owning that corporation, has shareholders or whatever. And there are these things like, um, have you ever seen that slavery footprint Dot Org? No, it's a, it's a fun website.

Speaker 1:          01:13:42       You got to do it when you're feeling good about yourself though. What it does is, um, uh, you, you put in everything that you own. If you have a car, not where you live and this and that, and it calculates how many slaves are working for you right now. God and like with like whatever. Getting that. Yeah. Getting the Molybdenum for your iphone or whatever it is or you know, losing their fingers in some molybdenum, molybdenum, Molybdenum to metal. Is it a rare, rare metal? Wow. I never that one. I've just recently heard a cold Tan. That's the stuff that they get in the Congo than for self. Something that's really good with activity or something to do with the electronic connectivity in the use of cell phones. So it's, I've, I've found that to be so bizarre and one of the more bizarre things in life that the most complex stuff that we use, like cell phones, computers, that the very base of it, the origins early, there's a mine, there's a hole in the ground.

Speaker 1:          01:14:41       Also human suffering, which is why I don't like the idea that my computer, which could really do everything I needed to do is rendered obsolete by changes in operating systems that really are unnecessary except to sell another computer. You know, the difference does not, uh, but I don't think necessarily because they're trying to continue to improve the product and they're continuing to add more functionality and believing that or at least at the rate at which they do. I sometimes feel like there's a, a, it used to be sort of windows and Intel that you know, windows and make it complex operating systems so that you'd have to get the next intel chip and then Intel would, we'd create a tweak on that. That makes you the next, uh, next Windows operating system that they sort of would leapfrog each other. And it feels like that with them.

Speaker 1:          01:15:27       Yeah. You know, you're, you're, yeah, you're iphone is better things now. Then three iphone to go. But what about all these iphones in the garbage and all these people who lost all this stuff and the amount of time compressed into one of these, one of these devices is really intense. You know that, that at least one of our, our, our goals when we're developing new technologies and new technology pathway should be, well, what's the one that's going to actually require the sales of the lease up, the fewest amount of computers. I don't know how many people are going, how could we sell? How could we need to sell less computer so that we're, you know, people don't have to throw out these old ones. Have you seen those photos of Cuba, of the old cars? Because Cuba doesn't get new cars. They have cars from like the fifties and sixties and they are gorgeous.

Speaker 1:          01:16:14       They're beautiful, but they do drive like shit. That's the problem. If you drive like a modern day BMW and then you go back to willow, stupid Chevy's from the 19 fifties, those things are dog shit. They break terrible. They, they handle like a horse on roller skates. Their ridiculous cars. They're so stupid. We know how to be thrown into rebel without a cause today. And you hopped in that car. It will not be that. It wouldn't be. The experience were thinking. They're talking shit. They're terrible. You could with a prius, you could easily get away from some guy in a 55 chevy. There's no way you keep up. Those things are terrible. They can't take corners. The breaks of his stupid drum brakes. I mean they might as well have a rock that you throw out that's attached to a rope to slow your car. Tell you, take a. You take a 57 t bird over a segue. Yes, yes. Over just because it could rain. Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:17:09       I liked the idea that, you know, they've managed to recycle these cars and keep them working and keep them running and it's really cool to see it aesthetically. It's beautiful. It's gorgeous. I mean you see a, a modern street in this day and age and you see these beautiful like, and you can tell they're proud people because these are shiny cars. They're painted nice and they're done well and they're restored well or, or at least maintained well. I mean, I don't know how many miles some of these cars have on them, but they do look, it does look amazing. I know there is that, you know, I feel like there's a hunger for stuff, not just fifties, but also started to sixties madmen period that this Dahlia for that, so that, that's right before this digital age started. That's like the height of the TV agents, you know, putting satellites in space.

Speaker 1:          01:17:59       There was that innocence, you know, you know, it's funny because people look at these kinds of shows and say, Oh, you know, aren't they a Tibet, Tibet there, uh, you know, decadence. And I was like, no, it's about their innocence, you know, they believe in, they got, you know, it's that, you know, and you go around La, it's like everybody's got hayward Wakefield in their house and trying to get those old g frigerators with this sort of rounded coverage. You know, there's that longing for a, like the industrial age just feels so real. You know, it's a solid when people made stuff, you know, it wasn't just kind of printed, right? Yeah. There's that, that also like when you see those cars, there's such a human element in that old stuff. Like even like sixties muscle cars, like those were sort of like human created works of art as opposed to, you know, you look at like a new Mazda or something like that, a real modern car and they're like, it looks like something that just came out of a machine.

Speaker 1:          01:18:53       They screwed it together and came out of a machine. You looked at like a 69 chevy that doesn't like a Chevy Camaro. Sixty nine Camaro. That's something somebody fucking screwed together. There's some men work in behind that. There's some people put tires on the wheel and bolted in place. There's some guys who work some wrenches. There's no doubt about it. You look at that thing that's a mechanical creation. It's not a a computer creation and we're slowly moving towards the Prius and I'm fine with computer creation aesthetic if it means that we don't have to work, they didn't. So they get rid of all those guys, screw it in the screws and then let them stay in their houses. Fuck ended up, fuck. Those guys have to pick up a lot of work. They have to evolve with the times. That's the whole thing too. It's like, so now we have.

Speaker 1:          01:19:45       The big problem in America is unemployment. Obama talking about getting jobs, jobs. Jobs are people who wants a job. I don't want a job. You don't want to jump. People don't want jobs. People want this stuff that you get when you have a job. They want the money that you get for having a job, but they don't want the jobs. Right? So meanwhile though, we've got more than enough stuff. We're burning food every week, so you keep market prices high. We're tearing down. Bank of America is tearing down houses in California because they're in foreclosure. You can't just let someone live in it. It's going to bring price down. They tear them down. Why did they tear them down? Because they're there. Would have to sell at distressed prices that would then lower prices of other properties that they're trying to keep up. What it would cost them more money.

Speaker 1:          01:20:26       If you own 10 houses in a town and one isn't going to sell, you'd rather a tear it down. Then if the bank comes along and create some sort of a program to give houses to needy people, then it's going to lower the real estate values of the, of the mortgages that they've invested in that are already teetering. So they can't do that. So charity itself becomes unprofitable. It's never been quite profitable, but that's like less than unpalatable. What if we figured out that okay, we only need rather than having everybody work 40 hour weeks, which is based on a clock and the industrial age, how much can we have people working at weekend? What if people don't really have to work that much for us to have everything we want? But what if 10 percent of people could work, you know, two days a week and we get everything right?

Speaker 1:          01:21:07       So you go in, you do your work. I'm going to do my work in April 2007, you know, and then I'm going to go again in March. What if it got that? You really didn't need everybody working all the time for everybody to have stuff. We couldn't deal with that. Not because we don't have technologies to do that. We can't deal with it because we don't have an economy. We don't know how to divvy up the spoils. You know the reason that you have a job is so that you can be entitled to a share of what's actually in them in abundance, but because there's not enough jobs for people, we've got to rip up stuff and ruin stuff that's in abundance because we can't give it out. There's also the social issue of not having jobs when people don't feel like they've made their own way or pulled their own weight.

Speaker 1:          01:21:47       They feel unworthy, they feel, but you gotta replace employment with work. You know, employment is a new invention. Employment, again, industrial age. We used to work for each other and ourselves. We only got jobs when we got the clock. When we could work on the clock, then we're employed or but we don't have to be employed in order to work. In order to have meaning. If you don't have to have your job, you don't stop, so you just have to find a new niche into the system. You have to find a new thing that you contribute to your to the world. Yeah, I completely agree with that, but too many people find sort of a preexisting way to interact and they don't create their own way to interact and in doing so, you oftentimes miss on one of the best things which is accomplishing things, whether it's accomplishing starting your own restaurant and keeping it open and in or having a car shop that only fixes a certain type of automobile that you really love to work on.

Speaker 1:          01:22:47       You know when you can figure out a way to do something that you actually have a passion for that. It's like the the, the old cliche. It stops becoming work. It just, it becomes you're you. You don't really have a job. You have a thing that you love and you're in flow at that point and how many people have that and that's problem is you can't have it in this kind of economy. You can have it. When you have this kind of education system, you can have it. What about just real naturally dull people that need to be pushed in certain directions, but you know, so not everyone has to be the one that figures out how to do the new method of biodynamic. Rudolph Steiner farming on their organic community supported agriculture plant. Someone can just go there and plant plant carrots. It's also the issue of how human beings are raised in the first place, which is so huge and not really addressed the.

Speaker 1:          01:23:37       The reason why some of these people fall into these mindless jobs is because never along the line of they've been stimulated neverland, one by their family, by the school systems, by their environment, by their atmosphere, by their, you know, their fellow knuckleheads in their community. They're all just surrounded by people who are either likeminded or less or you know, or support it and you kind of fucked. And then when something comes along that eliminates that job for that guy, that robot job when he was 45 years old or 50 years old and he has to start again and sort of reignite some sort of passion and curiosity or die off like a dinosaur. And it's hard too, because he was liking the thing he did, you know, if he's a toll collector, you know, and you get better and better at it and then you start, you know, then test to see how many people you can make eye contact with when you're getting the towels and the how many lives can you change with that?

Speaker 1:          01:24:28       I mean, Gosh, he can be that you could live the bodhisattva life as a toll collector. You know, they take that away from him and it's not just that he can't be retrained, he doesn't have motivation, you know what I mean? It's not his fault that they broke his heart. They should have a show where a guy's a toll collector and just see how he interacts with people and then give them projects. Like, today you're just going to casually mention your penis and let's see how many people freak out back there. Back to your reality roots. Yeah, that'd be funny. You do. You have to do a toll collector. You got to do it pretty fast. Well yeah, that'd be a weird way to experiment how people interact when they don't have to. It was really quick. You know, how many people treat you like shit?

Speaker 1:          01:25:11       How many people were like, how are you doing? What's going on? Everything. Cool. All right man. Take care of. You know this. You're going to get a broad variety of the way people interacted with you. I think that'll be kind of fun. Wouldn't like hold up as a series, but maybe a one hour special. The tall guy. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Just have a guy and you have, we have to do like break it up with like a sit down. Yeah, the chairs and then have a discussion about the last couple of ones that we've seen and what it really means. People love that fast track thing now though, they won't, don't want to pay it. Totally want to put that little thing up there and they just go through like New York is one of the weirdest scenarios ever because somewhere along the line they just decided to make people pay to get to the city.

Speaker 1:          01:25:51       It used to be that they were paying to get the bridge built, but they paid that fucking thing off a long time ago. Every bridge got paid off a long time ago, but revenue is so intoxicating. They just kept with it. We can understand that in California because we don't really have a plate. We could get anywhere it was bitches were built, but now they got to all be rebuilt, rebuilt. I understand. Hudson bridge. They were building and building and building and by the time they've finished they had to start rebuilding it again. It was that many years. Two reasons why that's nonsense. The big one is, is the dumbest way to make traffic. You have a spot where everyone has to stop on the way into the city. That is so stupid. When you are going from Long Island to Manhattan, that is the most maddening shit to do at 8:30 in the morning, you want to fucking kill somebody because it's so stupid box.

Speaker 1:          01:26:49       You should make people pay. You know, either either you could justify the construction of the bridge, the maintaining of the bridge, but they should pay for through their taxes and that's it. There shouldn't be a spot we have to stop because that's fucking dumb. The only reason why you would want to do that is you want to check cars for bombs are nutty people or are you just trying to discourage? Yeah. Well I guess maybe try to discourage, get people onto the lirr and do rapid transit the way God intended and discourage people from coming into the city because the easier it is to get into the city, the more the traffic sucks and it sucks already. It's terrible when make it suck and then charge for making it knapsack stuck. You can't fix the suck that way you just suck $20. We'll give you the green light.

Speaker 1:          01:27:33       Do you live in Manhattan now? Do you live in New York? I live in New York. I live in Westchester County. I lived in new Rochelle for a little bit on Hudson. Oh yeah. It's um, that's a, that's a beautiful area. That's nice. The whole Westchester. It's got some nice pots. Yeah, it does. It's a little snooty. Some of it. So there's a couple of towns in Westchester that kind of retained some little shit to reality, you know, it's not just westchester is a weird. It is though. You'll be in a neighborhood where you're seeing these mansions with these giant lawns and then you'll go a half a mile and you're in the projects and projects, so it's a little more. Jersey Jersey ask drive through the oranges. It's that. It really, you get that sense. I mean, most of Westchester is pretty a pretty affluent at this point, you know, but you know, it's not as affluent as Manhattan.

Speaker 1:          01:28:26       Manhattan is the most affluent and. Right, right. Well, yeah, I mean you, if you're inside Bloomberg's bubble, if you made it in there somehow, you know when you entered the apartment was Amelia and I, you've got $10,000,000 of real estate or something, but um, you know, anywhere else doesn't quite. It's not quite that. Those places are madness. Those multimillion dollar apartments, like the way of living in the big city like that is so alien. It's only exists in Manhattan where you have so many people living in apartments and it creates a different community and in, in the sense it's more than than Los Angeles.

Speaker 3:          01:29:04       Oh, it is. I mean, most things about it are, are kind of more consonant with our era in our digital economy and all that. It's a better carbon footprint is stack people up like that, that they have everybody. I'm in lawns and fertilizer and whatever else they get in the suburbs. So, I mean, it's, it's, it's good on, on most of those levels. It's just New York itself is so crazy expensive, you know, through God knows what sort of real estate shenanigans are done. That's what sort of then for me colors the, uh, the experience of urban joy there, you know, there's no one is an artist or a writer. Regular of a regular means could live there.

Speaker 1:          01:29:43       Yeah. That's where it gets really crazy when you see a small apartment is like 3000 bucks a month and you're like, okay, that's just nuts. That means a guy who makes $50,000 a year, it has to give up three quarters of his income to pay his fucking rent. That's not,

Speaker 3:          01:29:57       that's right. So it's like, I mean, I don't know if you need crime, uh, to make it better, but you know, you'd go back to the era of, you know, Basquiat, he couldn't live in Manhattan and you know, none of that. None of the folks from then one of the ramones or. Well they were queens actually, but uh, you know, or Warhol or any of his 42nd street. The real. But that's the thing though, it's like exhausting. It was criminal. It was, you know, it was awful. Terrifying. Yeah. It was terrifying. And yeah, there's certain, some part that wax nostalgic, but that's not a good old days that you really want to return to either. It's just like, how can you have a New York that works and is still artistic and alive and vibrant and fertile and not have people, you know, getting stabbed in the stomach.

Speaker 1:          01:30:43       Yeah. And how can you have so many rich people live in together? Because you have to be rich to live there. I mean, it's, it's really difficult to pull off living in Manhattan if you don't have at least, you know, upper middle class income. So yeah, it's a strange, strange place. Unlike any place in this country, you know, there's no place in the country that's so overvalued and you can get a decent apartment in San Francisco for half of what you'd spend on an apartment in Manhattan. San Francisco now has gotten worse. Something one of those lists. Well, look the worst. There's some places outside of San Francisco that are just insane. Like we're, I'm near Stanford. Uh, they have, um, I think it's called Atherton. So the highest real estate in the country. Uh, and you, you look at these people that I know have this house up, there is an acre and a half is worth $15,000,000 to fucking look into this.

Speaker 1:          01:31:37       I was like, what are you talking about? It doesn't make any sense, but it's like everybody in that neighborhood is all. They're all tech people. They all, they all made insane amounts of money and the various tech bubbles and booms over the years and all that. Google money's up there and all that. Apple money's up there and there's just a lot of fucking people that have incredible amounts of cash up there. So real estate, they need houses. This is what they live. So real estate's through the fucking roof, right? Like you will look if you look at, like I, I enjoy doing that sometimes. Like could I live in Phoenix? Let's see what, you know, what the neighborhoods are like in Phoenix and I'll go look at real estate in Phoenix for a goof. You look in Atherton and what's $11,000,000? She'll like, get the fuck out of here.

Speaker 1:          01:32:17       That's $11,000,000. Well they got to be bike distance from facebook or wherever. It's an amazing bubble of, of money. And this strange one of really strange one because again, you go a mile over and we've stopped at this Wendy's and it was like a really sketchy Wendy's. Like really? Like this place is kind of fucking dirt baggish to be a mile away from a $15 million dollar house. Like it's so strange how there is no middle anymore. Yeah. That sort of got, got, got spun out in the, in the spin cycle at the end of the day. This industrial age here. Well you can't say there's none, but I mean just and certainly a diminished very little, very little. But you know, like you're saying no, if, if that, if that lower 98 percent or 99 percent, whatever it is, a gets fed up enough, it'll network with itself rather than trying to get something down from the top.

Speaker 1:          01:33:10       I don't even fed up. It seems like we only act when we forced to act. We need a desperation. We need, you know, we need to have no options and then we move into this new stage of understanding what the fuck. The real problem. But that's. And that's different. And again, that's, that's the whole point of, of being in the president of presenteeism is that instead of going on some Long March on some other 20th century movement or this eyes on the prize and just the means justify the means battle to the future thing, we go, screw all that. We just want it now. We're gonna just do it. That's what it was. So encouraging about the occupy movement. What are your demands? What do you want from us? We didn't want anything from you, you know, it was like we're not going to stay at our demands.

Speaker 1:          01:33:47       Were going to actually do this thing, you know? And that's where, again, we'll do what thing though, there the real issue, right? To try to occupy the world in which we live. I love, I liked in the occupy movement to white blood cells. Like they recognize there's an issue and they gather around it and you know, it's like if calls attention to the issue and you know, they're, but they, they're, they're gathering around a six spot. I mean that they know there's something wrong here. And so everybody's like, oh, this is the spot, it's all going down right there. They try to educate, they do teach ends and learn about stuff a lot. A lot of people know more about these issues now than did before. And they see it as a super longterm project. I mean, this year they did an occupied debt and the debt jubilee.

Speaker 1:          01:34:32       So what they're doing is buying pennies on the dollar, the debt of people like you've got, you know, health bills, they can't pay and all that because it's just owned by credit companies. So they buy the debt and just believe it. Wow. So it's kind of cool, you know, they take $10 in relief, like a thousand bucks a debt and it's well worth it. That's interesting. That's a great idea. And I think that's a great community idea that there's a lot of people out there that I have a spare $5 or a spare $10 you won't even think about. But if you get of those people, you can

Speaker 3:          01:34:58       enact some real change and really help people. Um, what do you think is like what, what is the best way besides podcasting, besides books and besides having actual conversations with people where you explore these ideas, what is, what is the best way to get people to understand that true happiness really does come from a sense of community where one of the interviews that I saw with you, you were talking about your youth and you were talking about living in a place where you all shared a large backyard and it became sort of a community thing where everybody would get together and have like a barbecue and then queens and we had, it was like one barbecue pit at the end of the block that was just on all weekend. That's when we were lower middle class. My Dad got a better job. We leave Queens, we'd go to Larchmont in scarsdale.

Speaker 3:          01:35:46       These, you know, these Westchester towns. He. Yeah. And it's like you don't barbecue with the Joneses anymore, you barbecue it against the Jones. It's like every single family has got its own, like $300 a weber grill in the backyard and no one would think, you know, it's like you can invite someone over I suppose, but it's not that barbecuing was this solo family activity and I was thinking about as far as the grill company's concern, that's better. They'd rather everyone have a grill and nobody grilled together because then they get to sell more grills, you know, but what it's like, I've, I've looked in my, uh, not the neighborhood I'm in now, but never. I almost went to because like everybody on the block had a snowblower and I'm thinking that's really weird. There's like 10 houses with 10 snowblowers. How many snowbirds do you need per driveway? It's like that. Every two houses share one for every four houses shared one. Want to get up in the morning and you don't want to talk to Mr Johnson can use the snowblower first because you got to be at work at 7:30. You don't want to talk to Mr Johnson. Is the phase a Douche bag? Maybe. Maybe you should be able to have your own snowblower. There isn't a huge bag is because he's working overtime to save up for that guy.

Speaker 3:          01:36:59       Yeah. Well there's not a lot of people that are happy out there as the roads quote that most men live lives of silent desperation today. Loud desperation and Marshall McLuhan's quote that humans are the sex organs of the machine world and that has this desire to keep up with the Joneses. You got to pay for those Weber grills, you know, as the disconnects us, you know, I walk in a room now and I feel it feels different when I see people sitting on their devices. You know, you used to walk into a room with a bunch of guys. You walk in here and you guys have devices, but you can feel the family, you know, you can feel you guys are on an animal level in touch with each other's vibe. Right? On whatever that subtle level is. And I go into rooms now and I don't feel the same group dynamic group presence than I used to even teach in a class, you know, 20 years ago versus going into one today when everybody's reading what's going on in there. It's just different. I'm not saying it's worse, so though

Speaker 1:          01:37:56       I think it's worse. I'm a qualitatively different experience. They have more choice over what they do. They can divide their attention the way they want, they have more autonomy over all these things, but they're losing. And maybe it's out there on the net somewhere. Maybe by the time we're in the great, great second life we reconnect, but they're, they're missing a certain subtle animal contact that we don't yet fully understand. Maybe he just needs to be mitigated. Or maybe we need to just understand and explore like the ethics of a when to and not to use cell phones when to and not to connect and encourage more connection and like let people know. They're like, look, that is an impulse. Just like washing your hands too a or just like there's like a lack of satisfaction in the satisfying or the completion of that impulse to check twitter.

Speaker 1:          01:38:47       You check your twitter checking twitter again, what are you getting out of that? Why not pay attention to the person who's in front of you but you're doing it so like a nutty person washes their hands 100 times. That's the whole point. That's the whole reason I write in my books are that book before this one is called program or be programmed and the idea was just to give people sort of the 10 biases of digital media. Like they're really good for doing things far away. They're not going to be doing things with someone in the same room because they're. They're just really simple stuff like that or this time idea, which is that digital technologies asynchronous, it doesn't live in time, so don't you try to keep up with it because it's not in your temporal universe. It's in its own, you know, and you can make it conformed to yours, but certainly don't run and chase it.

Speaker 1:          01:39:27       It's that. It's kind of, it's at this point, it's education, it's just having the conversation letting people. That's the whole thing. If they become more aware than you know, then they stand a chance. I certainly think a lot of these things is sort of snuck up on us and we could all do with a lesson or at least an idea of how to manage them more. Right. More humanly. Exactly. In the trick is for people not to see it and this has been my whole thing not to see the messenger of this as the one who saying, oh, this stuff's so bad. Oh, well the children are turning more violent. You know, that whole kind of pbs ish hand wringing thing that so many writers are out there. It's like, are you for technology or against it or for it or against it. You know, and if you're not just going, Yay, go business.

Speaker 1:          01:40:14       They think you're against it. And it's like, no, no, I'm for technology. I'm just against the way were happened to be using it right now. I don't think there's any. I don't think it's a coincidence that people are. I think fundamentally less happy now, I think than they have been in a long time. If you look at the amount of people that are on medication for happiness, it's really what it is and if you're on an antidepressant, essentially you're on a medication for happiness and whether or not that's because of a chemical imbalance that you suffer from or because of the fact that your job sucks in your life sucks and you, you just, you're just filled with suck every day and you're responding to the well for whatever it is. If you look at those numbers,

Speaker 3:          01:40:54       one or two things is happening. Probably both. One, we're getting fucked over by these pharmaceutical companies and they get unethical doctors to prescribe that shit with impunity and there's that for sure, but then there's also like, people are not connected to this world. They don't, they don't feel whole. They don't feel satisfied in great pain. It's better to only be in moderate pain or mild pain. If you can take a pill. I mean, what's hard to do is to get people to go, oh, well actually that pain is, is kind of a good sign because it means that we all need to kind of work here to change, to change the way the world is and, and, uh, and take some action. The pain is trying to get you to change. The paint is trying to get you to avoid the pain and you should use your logic to say, well, what's causing this pain?

Speaker 3:          01:41:35       But there's a disconnect. I'm not, I'm not, I'm not emotionally satisfied. I'm not connecting with my fellow humans. I'm missing something unless you're up against the wall and there's nothing you can do to change your circumstances and wishing to take the pill. That's the, that's the danger there. But I do think that more people can start to get in touch. You know, for me it's these rhythms, you know, the rhythms of life, you know, the 28 day lunar cycle and the fact that each week of a lunar cycle, your neurotransmitters change, right? So you have siedel Coleen week followed by a serotonin week, filed by a dopamine. We followed by a norepinephrine week. It's like every month is one bump, bump bump. If you know that, then you're like, oh, this is the dopamine week. That's why I feel like this. Or I'm getting strangely. I mean, we go to, there's a website, someone space.org that he's got it, he's got it laid out.

Speaker 3:          01:42:22       There was originally, it was an Olympic trainer, irving Dardick who figured this stuff out. He was, uh, doing exercising people at different times of the day in different parts of the month. And they, you know, they've been looking at bio, a biological clocks for many years ever since the, you know, Major League baseball, pretty much discovered jetlag that people, you know, get more jet lag when they traveled west to east and east to west. And they realize all these clocks are not folklore. There's actually something going on here. So their circadian rhythms for the day and the night. But there's also all these other rhythms controlled by different, you know, uh, you know, whether an astronomical features and traveling like that really does fuck with those rhythms. Right? Yeah. Yup. But as people get in touch with them, um, I think it could help us, uh, you know, get out of some of these, uh, you know, drug, a drug relationships that we're having, you know, wherever you taking drugs in order to compensate for those shifting neurotransmitters because we're trying to be on all the time.

Speaker 3:          01:43:18       I'm in sales so I got to be in sales when I'm in dopamine week or in Serotonin week, you know, and that's, that's hard. Well, there's also the, the arrogance of the human mind to think that I can manipulate the human mind, the human mind going like, oh, like how things are running here. I think I am going to take over the running of me and I'm going to invent some shit that makes me run more to my liking. I'd rather just be okay with everything. Uh, I want to be high all the time and okay with everything, okay, can you get that? And then one day they're going to get what you feel like when you're on ecstasy and it's

Speaker 1:          01:43:52       going to be, keep it all day, just all day, enjoying the world. Wow. You've never seen this guy, this color blue, you're going to be so happy to have those though. They don't like you genuinely have those drugs because when, if you're as high as you are an ecstasy or as high as you are pot, then you start figuring things out and then you start unwinding that relationship and becoming less dependent on Sam. It could even just a shift in the levels of things and the approach to things gives you a, Oh, this is a new consciousness space that I'm occupying here for. Whether it's a brief moment or a long drawn out crazy trip and it's different than the solar sort of palliative care of. Of Pharmaceutical. Sure, yeah. Yeah. That, that does the exact opposite is true. The ones that are available that you could buy on a regular basis are the ones that bring you closer to the hive.

Speaker 1:          01:44:37       Drone. Exactly. Yeah. Just to let you accept more and take more. Even Caffeine and alcohol, you know, such easier them to tolerate the one that's interesting. That's sort of playing both sides of that, of the field here is adderall. You know what I mean? Because they use it to control a little kids, adderall and Ritalin. It's one of these add drugs that keeps us kids from, you know, acting out or a different class. But also the counterculture is taking it for a, you know, to write, to write or work or to get that, uh, kind of a right. I've never fucked with it. But the people that I know that I've said it kind of hampers creativity. Right. I guess. I guess it's more for a, like a speed yet cramming for a test drive. Yeah. Yeah. Getting work done. Organizing Shit. Like my friend Robert Schimmel rest his soul.

Speaker 1:          01:45:26       Uh, he, um, he accidentally took it once and he had heart issues. It was kind of a crazy story. He picked up the wrong pill, someone else's prescription and took an adderall. Then he called his doctor. It's like, what am I in trouble? I'm scared. You know, I got this heart condition and the guy's like, you're gonna be fine. You're going to be fine. You're just gonna you're gonna be, you're going to be a doing a lot of things over the next few hours and just accept that so he takes any said he just starts fucking organizing his office and he sat down in front of his notes and he said, I got more work done than I've ever gotten before. But. Well yeah, that's why they call it speed, but it's a, it's a great. Did pay a price. The ultimate industrial age truck I guess said it makes you more, more productive, more efficient.

Speaker 1:          01:46:09       Quite a few friends who've had an issue with it. Several, you know, uh, a good friend, very smart guy who just went, I'm just got off of it and you know, he, he went crazy with it for like several months and he was starting up a business and working with a tech company and there's was a lot of hours and he just took a little adderall to help them along the way. And next thing you know, he needed adderall. Every man. Yeah. They do say this to sort of, I think speed, longterm speed use is the closest they can model schizophrenia with drugs had been on speed freak for a really long time. You get way closer than with any psychedelic or something. Yeah, I taught both. It just seems like it just red lines. Your system. Yeah. Lindsay Lohan's

Speaker 3:          01:46:50       plead deal. One string attached. I want my adderall. Was that TMZ?

Speaker 4:          01:46:55       Yeah, she's supposed to be in that prison or that Rehab for the next whatever 60 90 days is. She's trying to get a plea deal so she can be an adderall and wait a minute. They're putting her in jail again. Yeah. What for this time? Uh, I think it was for hit and run back in 2010 or something like that. I can't remember kid. I've been following it.

Speaker 3:          01:47:16       Well, there's another weird aspect of our new society that children become famous. You know, back in the Shirley temple days when they invented that. Yeah. Who would've ever thought that you would get a person like a Lindsay Lohan? We raised them from the time their child and they never know anonymity and just long to escape every day long you can get fucked up and just drift away in a drunken stupor and not have to think about it. Yup. And they can't leave it as the thing because they're also to, to uh, to add. Yeah. And if you do leave it, it's almost worse to Vin a husband than to be a never was. It never was. You see a person walking on the street, you never go, oh, look at that loser. He was never fast. He just called. There's a gosh, I'll tell Ya. It reminds me there was this moment that I still don't know exactly how I feel about it.

Speaker 3:          01:48:07       When they did the, they did the brady bunch reunion. It's like 10 years after the show, whatever, 20 years. And Jan didn't show up. They had a different girl for Jan and I was like, coconut oil. In other words, she broke free and we'll move on. She'd probably eat plums. She probably got, you know, all this crap for not going. And a lot of people probably thought, oh, because she's probably too screwed up or some problem, whatever. And I'm like, no, you know, you went, you went into the future, you know, and we're not going to let that define you no matter what. Yeah. Or she wanted money and they didn't. Who knows, who knows, who knows? Media is good for projecting. There's something very sad about people that live completely in the past. Like if you were on a show in the 19 seventies and you're still going to those autograph signing things and tired.

Speaker 3:          01:48:58       I heard that it was Barbara Eden on the radio, you know, Juma Genie. Yeah. And I was thinking, man, that's one of those. It's one of those things. Well Barbara Eden also was in a time where you didn't make money like you didn't get that residual cash or people are still selling. I dream of Jeannie. She would still be getting a palace. But no, he didn't. She didn't get a slice back in those Gilligan's island days. Those guys didn't make any money. They got fucked over. Gilligan's island days was uh, the, you know, like back in the day, they never knew about like syndication. They didn't, they didn't have any idea that things are going to be worth so much money and then in a digital form forever. Dude, I was supposed to be at my next thing by now. Whoops. It's like five.
