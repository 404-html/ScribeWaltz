Speaker 1:          00:00          The joe rogan experience. So when, when I worked for Jamison, I worked for James from, for two years. Did the Jamison tore me. Billy Gardell, Steve Byrne, uh, Michael Loftus, Nick Griffin and Danny Bevins and you, they sent cases at Jamison to your house every fucking month they sent cases of pace is of Jamison. Nug Spence, how they expect you to drink it all. And, and know when you got to a show, Jamison waiting in the green room and the rule was you had to drink at Jamison onstage. You had to mention how good your Jamison was, but putting on a show like take a step like, damn, that's good fucking Jamison. Like, and you had to like, hey everyone today, like you had to be pro Jamison. I got no problem with that because Jameson is pretty God damn good. It's fucking awesome. Good Shannon, we get done the tour. You ready for this? They buy us each of them acre of land in, in fucking, in Ireland on a river. All of us right next to each other. We get a fucking Acre land, a deed and a picture. Whoa. Yeah. Fucking Jamison was, you got to build a house in Ireland. Now you can't build, you can't build on it. Can't build on it and it's fucking pointless.

Speaker 2:          01:01          But can you camp on it? You could camp on it. They can't take him Billy garden permanent. Can you have a permanent tent? Yeah, but me and a bunch of pikeys ob fucking t w o pikeys. Yeah Dude, I've been obsessing about watching these Irish travellers fights. Can we, some of the uncles, oh my God, they have some of the best fights, dude. You got to Brian, you got to look this up. They're boring as shit. I mean most of these guys, but they're tough guys and everything. But there's a different style of fighting when you fight bare knuckle and literally they stand there and volunteer themselves in the face. It's not like a street fight like you see in the states. Have you seen that once they challenge each other, when they challenge each other? How to tell you that Johnny. Johnny Mac. Yeah. You're good for nothing.

Speaker 2:          01:40          That's how you are gonna happen and yeah, cause I thought Boston's Heidi of hall. I'll tell you, I don't know. I'll fight cha anytime before Christmas. Any. I thought, goodness me, there's a beauty. I mean, there's a video of of a pikey driving to a street. They said, well, meet what? Be a according to the click to flies. It uploads it. And whoever knows that one between me cause I, I tweeted it a while ago. It's really hilarious, but I can't find it in my Twitter while the show is going on. But I want to play it because it's so, it's so ridiculous to see something really disturbing Irish travelers. Then there, there were talking shit before street fight. It's even better than the actual

Speaker 1:          02:15          most disturbing pikey video on there is most disturbing one. Every week someone's listening that knows exactly what I'm talking about at. Please tweet it to Joe and me and Brian, it is pikey gets what he deserves and it's a bunch of a British school, kids in a park having beers, snorting coke, smoking weed, and a pike, you will comes up and he won. But it's all done post. It's a, it's a recount of the British kid going. So a little pikey comes up and he wants to little drink. He wants the thing. I didn't do this and that. Well, we tell them it's cocaine, but guess who just got a nose full of k, a special k and they cut in the pike. He is fucking seizuring on the ground. It's bulky. Sketchy. Breaks your heart because you go, that guy's helpless. He's in a k hole right now. He's not coming out anytime soon and it's all, it's if you've, if you type in Brian of you typing pikey gets what he deserves, park or something like that, you'll see it and it fucking, you just go, oh, that shit happens. That fucking happens. That does happen. But manuals pikey fights were gripe. Fucking was obsessed with those for a while.
