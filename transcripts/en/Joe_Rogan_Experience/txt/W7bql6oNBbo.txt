Speaker 1:          00:00:02       Hello Freak bitches were back. This episode is brought to you by ting. Ting is the official cell phone provider for the Jews and his name is boss. You guys. Uh, Ting is a cell phone provider. I've got one right here. This is the thing phone. This is my Samsung Galaxy note five. It's pretty dope. Uh, I liked the fingerprint thing. It's pretty sweet. The fingerprint thing is sweet and um, the fact that it's waterproof is pretty sweet too. Um, what it is, is with ting uses is the sprint backbone. These a sprint network, but they do it their way with no contracts, no early termination fees, no ride alongs or bundling and no, no bullshit that you ordinarily have to deal with. If you deal with most cell phone providers, most cell phone providers also have their billing setup for what they say. If you have a hundred minutes a month, but you only use like 10, which is by the way, what you probably use, most people don't fucking call anybody anymore.

Speaker 1:          00:00:56       You call someone for 10 minutes a month, you're a Weirdo unless you're doing business. My understanding if you're doing business. Um, but the point is with Ting, you only pay for what you use. They used to have it so that like they would credit you and your next bill and knock money off your next bill if you didn't hit them, they're ordered a hundred minutes but you only used 80. They would credit you that in your next bill. But then they realize like, why are we doing that? Why don't we just charge you for what you use? Like that's the most logical way to do it. And that's how Tim does it now. So I think every cell phone companies are going to be forced to do it that way. Cause that's what it should be. If you use more, you pay more. But if you're like a heavy data user, especially ting is an awesome way to go.

Speaker 1:          00:01:35       Ting uh, actually just dropped their rates because of their second year anniversary for no reason other than they got a better deal and they said, fuck it man. We're going to continue this path of being an ethical cell phone company with, which is a good idea. The good ideas, like to not fuck people over, give them something that's a good service that you can get at a good rate and uh, you feel good about the transaction, whereas, you know, you get those overage fees or you get some fucking early termination fee and it's like hundreds of dollars and you're like, fuck off man. You feel robbed while Tane has it set up so you don't do anything like that. Um, 98% of people would save money with Tang and that's because they do mobile differently. The average monthly bill per device for tin customers, it's $21. That's a, that's a pretty fucking cheap.

Speaker 1:          00:02:24       And if you go to rogan.ting.com you will save $25 off of any of their devices. They have a wide range of a cell phones, including a iPhone fives and all the greatest and latest of the android models, including the LG nexus five, the Samsung Galaxy s five, which is what I got right here. And the Samsung Galaxy note three. If you just can't have it big enough. rogan.ting.com save yourself 25 bucks. We're also brought to you by audible. If you go to audible.com forward slash Joe, you can get a free audio book from the number one provider of audio entertainment on the Internet. Audible has been around for a long fucking time and I've always been a big fan of audio books. It makes it so much easier.

Speaker 1:          00:03:24       And wait, if you get one of those from Amazon, the kindle fire HD and you get this thing called whisper sync, it's fucking crazy. You read the book. So if you're at home, you're sitting in bed, you read the book, and then when you get to a certain page, it syncs up with the audible version of it in your car. So you get in your car and then you listen to the audio version of the book. So it's like it keeps going for you. It's like you read when you can and then they'll read it to you in between, which I think is pretty fucking awesome. And if you want a free audio book, you can pick from over 150,000 titles, including life of the party by our pal Bert Kreischer actually read by Bert Kreischer and cool. You can get that shit for free if you go to audible.com forward slash Joe, uh, can't say enough good things about audible.

They have the opiate Anthony show. Um, that's not even Anthony anymore.

Speaker 1:          00:04:28       That's Bert Kreischer think we're violent and crappy way by planting them in the guy though. Anyway, audible.com forward slash Joe go there, my friends and get yourself a free audio book and one free month of audible service. That's right. Sweet bitches. Amazing. Also were brought to you by on at.com and we, right now it is September 3rd and it is a 3:00 PM west coast time, which means there's one day, 20 hours and 58 minutes and six seconds, uh, to go with the 72 hour sale, 72 hour sale, 15% off everything. You use the code CEP seven two, it's like the short for September and then 72 for the amount of hours in the sale. Uh, if you hear this after that, then just use the codeword Rogan and you could save 10% of any and all supplements, but it doesn't work on everything. This code is 15% code right now.

Speaker 1:          00:05:21       Works on everything, but on it is as a human optimization website. That's what we decided to call a website where we sell shit that does good things for you. Whether it's get you in shape, whether it's a give you healthy snack options like the hemp force protein bar, super healthy, very delicious, very good for you. Hemp, very easy to digest. One of the easiest proteins to digest. Uh, we have hemp force powder and that hemp force powders, the finest protein powder we could buy, the most expensive stuff. It's a, all of it comes from Canada because the United States is, I'm a fucking crazy place that will be mocked in the and the future when they look back at the marijuana laws and how preposterous they were and how they affected its cousin. It's non psychoactive cousin hemp and that's what hemp is. I mean it's not the version of marijuana that you use to get high.

Speaker 1:          00:06:11       It's a non get you high plant and it's still illegal because it's related to the get you high plant. It's the male version of the species. The female version of the species has the um, the buds which you, uh, you get your THC from. Uh, to answer your questions, cause I know a lot of people have questions about protein powders that involve hamp or any products and involve him. You cannot test positive. If you have a job that tests you, they make you pee in a cup. First of all, if you do have a job like that, strategize your way to get the fuck out of that fucking jail. Some Dick Wad doesn't let you take a hit off a joint on your weekend cause they're worried about you losing productivity for your fucking slave job and on Monday, fuck them. Set your phone down. That's fair enough.

Speaker 1:          00:06:55       Um, no, just answer it. Start calling people shit. Fuck. Oh, I want to do this show. Um, anyway, uh, hemp force. You can a, you can only, you can only test positive if you smoke weed while you're eating hemp force. But um, I should tell you that if you eat bagels that have like poppy seeds on them or anything with poppy seeds, you test positive for heroin. As crazy as that sounds. But it is absolutely true. If you're going in for a heroin test or any sort of a drug test, if you eat poppy seeds, you will test positive for heroin. It's very strange. It doesn't happen with hemp. Go to [inaudible] Dot Com oh Anne and I t and browse our lovely selection of strength and conditioning equipment as well as food supplements. All that good shit and use the code were rogue Rogan.

He put it together and he used our friends at Squarespace to design this website and to, uh, sell it all, which has been a pleasure. It's the best website creator ever.

Speaker 1:          00:09:23       All right, that's it folks. The Po me, what am I doing? I got um, September something or another. I'm in fucking Toronto. Let me find this, cause I didn't have it in front of me, but uh, we do a messy little Joe. I am doing the Sony Center. Uh, I liked Massey Hall but it was already booked, but I did the Sony Center before too, is pretty fucking dope. Yeah. Sony Center for the Performing Arts with Tony Hinchcliffe. Friday, September 26. Jody rose, who was supposed to be here tomorrow, but he had to, he got an acting gig. The kids got talent. You can hold them back. So Tony has taken his place and Joe Derosa we'll be here next Wednesday. Uh, in the future I have Rupert Sheldrake and Graham Hancock are going to be coming up. Uh, I got a lot of good guests. Real solid guests. Mike Dolce is going to be here next week. Uh, like I said, Jodie Ross will be here next week. All right, that's it. Boom. Schelok lock. Boom Saga. Oh, ice house. Ice House. I'm going to be at the Ice House in Pasadena September 12th and 13th. What does that like the weekend after this one with Tony Hinchcliffe. All right, that's it. Cube's music dominant areas here.

Speaker 1:          00:10:38       Dominic, me, brother, a little Joe for fuck sake. Look at you sitting up there and they asked me if I was David Letterman and it will actually tell everybody about this chair. This is my latest device to try to mitigate back pain from sitting. And it's called the uh, I think it's called a Sally. Yeah. S a l. L. I and it's a saddle chair. It's like a saddle. So if you see how it's sitting here. No, no one's endorsing this. I'm just telling you it feels, I'm going to tell you this. They would hate me endorsing this cause it feels like shit. It's like the least comfortable chair I think I've ever sat. But it's very good for your back and makes sure that you like, you can't sit any way other than like this. Like you have to sit like straight up. You can't like slouch in this thing just doesn't support it.

Speaker 1:          00:11:25       And when I sit in a regular chair, by the end of the podcast, my fucking neck starts to hurt like my back, like around here where I've been injured starts to hurt. What that like stretch your asshole out though and like give, that's what I'm trying to do is kind of easier for if I ever do wind up going in the pokey. I want to be just gaping soon. Um, no, it doesn't do anything in your asshole. You fucking idiot. You're sitting now. It's like your bubble. I know. I'm certainly easy. No, this is, you're not listening. The whole idea behind this is it's like a saddle. If you sit in a salary, you actually kind of have to hold yourself in place. So by squeezing your legs together, it's not opening your butthole. You're actually squeezing everything tight. So if you were a Gao and you wanted to have one of these, I figured it would probably be good for the ova.

Speaker 1:          00:12:09       Jj probably tighten that baby up. Like women are supposed to like do those key Glenn not supposed to. Supposed to. If they care about treaty, a penis correctly with their vagina, they do those Kegel exercises where you squeeze your vagina and you can actually make it stronger. There's some crazy bitch and Russia that's like the world record holder for the amount of weight she can carry with her pussy. But it's something substantial like 50 pounds. So she shoves a Dildo in her pussy, attaches it to a fucking kettle bell and a and does squats holding this, this Dildo in her, in her box just with our shield puts him like grabbing it like that.

Speaker 2:          00:12:43       Is anybody else getting hungry? Yeah. I don't know why I'm getting peckish. Did you ever hear a honeysuckle divine? Yes. Yeah. He's the one that used to shoot ping pong balls and needed a tuna fish sandwich with no, where was that at? Where did she do? She did it. The truck or their own Philadelphia cause it was like when we were kids it was like this big joke about how many circled the one. But uh, I was up at the rib and they were shooting a porn and you know, these porn girls need so much attention. Obviously they didn't have anything else to do and there's no more conversation. So one girl sits in a Bush, it goes do your trick. You know the, the, the container. There's the gores put in jams at dinner and she's just pops it out. But she paid, she hit the girl too hard. It was so funny. Girls faces there and you go boom, it's getting the girl goes, fuck, ah, big red mark on her face. And she explained that she could shoot it out of her pussy. So hard. It hurt. Yeah. Did you see that fucking Mantis shrimp that I posted

Speaker 1:          00:13:39       on my, uh, my uh, my Twitter page yesterday? No, you got to see this. This is the craziest fucking animal I have ever heard in my life. If you scroll down, a guy named Mike Jackson, Esquire, the truth, Jackson on Twitter sent this shit to me and it's a, a murder mantis shrimp. It's a shrimp that has a builtin weapon. It's not actually a shrimp. It's like they explain what it is. It has a builtin weapon. Like it has this thing where it's bodies like got a spring inside of it. It's got two hammers and it shoots to hammers out and slams on the like crabs and killed them and breaks their shells. Open breaks, open clams and crabs. It is the wild is looking at the, in the ocean somewhere. It's called, they call it the mantis murder shrimp and they have a video in slow motion explaining how this shrimp, I never, I never heard of it either until yesterday. This guy, uh, who was explaining it, we should give these guys a youtube page. Whatever it is, is that him smarter every day, smarter every day. That's called mantis murder. Shrimps Watch, scroll. Scroll it back just a little bit before, right where you were just a little bit there and it show you. Watch how this thing does. Turn the volume up.

Speaker 3:          00:14:52       Watch how it comes out. It wax this crab and fucking kills it. Fucking knocked it out. Watch this. Look at this. Isn't that nuts? It's got two hammers on the end of its clause. That's cool. I never do anything like this exist. Cool. How could that be kept almost all these years, these years, there's so many animals. Look at the crab is smashed, it crashed, crush the shell of the, the crab. It's crazy if that thing has been there and the ocean is whole time and we never heard about it until 2014 is too many things to pay attention to. What I had come here to this podcast to learn about shrimps that fuck people up or fuck things up. Um, yeah. It's not an actually a shrimp. It's like something else. They call it a here. I'll, I'll Google it and find out what the fuck it actually is.

Speaker 3:          00:15:40       But uh, incredible with this is that you're just finding out about boxing gloves almost. Yeah. Like hammers, right? Yeah. Look at that. So the whole goal of the podcast is smarter every day or the uh, the show smarter everyday. It's a really well done show too. Wow. They did a great job of explaining the mechanism that this thing has inside of its body. It's essentially like a spring. It pulls this thing back and that it holds it in place and wait. It's like locked and then when it gets close to things it just releases it. Blanches not a hundred. It has to hit you because it's underwater. Yeah, that's right. Close it them and deep underwater too. You know, it's not like it's on the surface. You're dealing with a lot of pressure. Amazing. Really amazing stuff. The world. Dominic. A jealous that I forget something else.

Speaker 3:          00:16:28       The last time we worked together we did kill Tony at the ice house cause I still don't go to the comedy store, but the Ice House, a version of kill Tony, you and I, I that was more fun than I've had doing a like a podcast and a long time. That was really fucking fun and we were crying lists. So silly, so silly. The, the, the, the premise behind kill Tony folks who don't know, it's a Tony Hinchcliffe and Brian red band have this podcast where they do, everybody does like a minute, like you have new comics that go up and do a minute and they have these two girls were their names again, Sarah wine shank. Then Kimberly condom. Very funny gals who do a free, not a free, a new rather minute every week, which if you've ever done standup before, it's hard. Yeah. It sounds like a new man.

Speaker 3:          00:17:14       It's easy, but you know, they don't get a chance to really develop it just every week. They do and do minute and they've done that since the very beginning. So their entire standup career has essentially been just doing stand up on the internet in front of everybody that takes balls. It does. But I was a little mean, I thought, but I was just having fun. Yeah. I had to be, if you've got to go for the jug, you'll uh, go for the juggler. I love guys that had a minute and they came up like with 35 seconds. Yeah. They couldn't fill a minute and were like, okay, are you guys from like, well if you stare at your mirror and you practice for a minute, it's most likely not really going to be a minute when you're up to cause you gotta be panicking. You'd be talking faster or do you ever get nervous anymore?

Speaker 3:          00:17:57       Ask me that. Yeah, I got nervous for a film my special in Denver. Uh, definitely a kid. Yeah, I got a little eh. Yeah. Cause I was probably good work. So hard for it. Yeah. It worked out great, but it was just, it was so much a preparation for it. I definitely felt more intense than a regular show. Not like you're big and uh, yeah. I did it a small place though. Did it at the comedy works well that's where I'm going this week. This month. Love that place. I did. He'd do a good downtown or to the cruise. She downtown the cruise ship. That's it. It's like the other place. Why do you say it's like you're just like a giant cause it all, it has, everything has like movie theaters, restaurants and it's all in one little block. Oh, I see what you're saying. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:18:36       Downtown is like funkier. Yeah. Well downtown's smaller too and it's like you're stuffed into that really cool room. That room is special in event. Well, yeah. Yeah, yeah. That's good idea. It was fun. I think it's better than a theater. I think so too. Well, my, my thought process behind it was that when you're at home, you're in your living room, your living room, it's very intimate. You're sitting down or you know, maybe your downloaded on your computer or you're in your office. But either way, you're, you're in a small environment usually, and you're sitting there watching like some guy on stage in front of thousands of people. It doesn't feel, I mean it's still a good show. Like you can, you can enjoy it, but you don't feel like you're there. No, but I watched, um, I've seen a couple of people doing, like Sarah Silverman had once she did it Largo and uh, I didn't watch too much of it, but I was like, wow, that feels good.

Speaker 3:          00:19:26       Like that. She's all in tight like that. It feels good. Like to watch a show where you're, you know, you're kind of like right there. So I decided to do it. I think it's good. I had this discussion to be a name dropper with tosh and with Seinfeld and both of them think theaters are better. And I just disagree. And even for Tasha. Zach, I think he's better in a club. And so I thought, I, why can't I just sit on my hands? I'm looking at people, sit on their hands, listen to me for an hour and a half because a lot of these people, you know, it's like I said, because I'd rather people be drinking. I'd rather them be a little distracted and having fun. Right. Then focus like it's theater. Yeah. There's definitely a difference in the kind of show that you can do to like, you can't like bang, Bang, Bang, Hammer.

Speaker 3:          00:20:06       I'm in a theater because the laugh that you got to wait for it to roll. Oh, fucks over the punchlines. I went to see Louis Black Mean Joey. Uh, we were staying at this place in Jersey and we were doing the theater the next day. He was doing it on Thursday. We were doing our Friday and we went in to watch and I was like, wow. Like when a guy's on stage, um, doing like telling jokes when people start laughing, you don't hear anything else he says until that laughter stopped. Yeah. And I never realized that because obviously you're on stage, you have the microphone, get the monitors broadcast in your face. So you hear yourself very loud and clear. But the audience, they don't hear you very good when people are laughing. It's real weird to share. And then we be, it's Madison Square Garden and places like that and you really had to wait for the wave to come by because otherwise you ready, you're talking over yourself, you're talking over the left.

Speaker 3:          00:20:56       Yeah, you talk over the laugh and you kill all the taglines. Anything after the punch line, which you know, but some of those taglines like they have to be done very quickly on in a comedy club, but for it to work. So there's a totally different kind of timing in a theater that like a joke won't work as well in some ways because like sometimes you say something and then he'd say something else and you say something, he'd say something out like, like those, like everybody's laughing at the first thing. Then the second thing, like in a theater, you have to say it, say it. You know there's a, there's a big pause and that timing gets funky. Totally different. Yeah. I'd much rather do a club. Yeah, it's the best. It's just you can't make as much money and that's the difference. But there's something to like some clubs or some theaters like uh, like Massey Hall, we were talking about Toronto Massey halls. Fucking phenomenal. Even though it's 3000 plus people, it's still phenomenal. It's like it's the right size. For some reason, I was there when night we had Jason Alexander Spf want to do an Improv. At the end of the show we had to follow Robert Schimmel talking about cancer and killing. He was fucking killing. I said to Jason, I said, Shit, molds kill and talking about cancer. What the fuck are we going to do? Fly around the room.

Speaker 3:          00:22:07       Yeah. He had a whole series like after he almost died, I saw him in Tempe and he, he had all this material about almost dying. You know about like he would bring up. Brilliant. Do you have to be to make that funny? He's honest as fuck, man. That guy was honest as fuck. He was such a sweet guy too. I ran into him, uh, after all the cancer stuff, you know, he, he'd survived it and piece really skinny. I ran into him at um, uh, Barnes and noble man, just randomly and he's so warm, so friendly. That really fucking bum me out. That bummed me out. The Robin Williams thing really bummed me out recently and Richard, Jenny really bummed me out. Those are, those are the big three. I didn't see it come on with Robert at all. I mean he was supposed to do my podcast now and I was just going to call him the silver.

Speaker 3:          00:22:57       It had a life work today, well around this week because what happened was I didn't call him because I knew he was upset about the series not getting picked up and he had, he had to go back home. These kids are going to school or whatever, something was going on in his life. I said, letting me leave him alone. I'll call him next week. There wasn't an next week. Fuck yeah. And I had to go on CNN and I fucking hated it because it just, it just find out a buddy who was dies and they want to talk about suicide and hell, he did it. And brain chemistry. I said, look, I, I'm sad right now. I don't want to really, I want to go into this a chemical bullshit and theory about why can we give them a moment. Yeah. Dana Gould wrote a piece for, I think it was for rolling stone that, uh, I also, uh, tweeted yesterday, let me find it here, but it is pretty detailed piece about, um, why

Speaker 2:          00:23:46       so many comedians are depressed and I thought brain's behaving badly. Yeah. It's for rolling stone. And Dana who is not just a funny, really funny comic I've known forever, but very bright guy, very, very insightful. And uh, he wrote this, uh, interesting thing after the whole Robin Williams thing, you know, he said something so funny to me. Uh, we were at the left factory, I did this bit about mother and daughter Exchange Club lesbians taking care of her younger girls sexually. Right. And vice versa. And I, there was two lesbians there. I said, yeah. Did you ever see it? One of the women? Yeah, yeah, I've seen, I set a time, ain't it? It's perverted. And so, and I, I say something about Dana, you know, being married and I get them and they sit down with him because he's done. I'm like, guys, I'm, I read 12 years. Of course I fucking seen, that's one of my favorites. Dan is a funny guy, man.

Speaker 1:          00:24:39       The thing about the Robin and also about rich Jenny that I, uh, it's not in my wheelhouse is the depression thing. Both those guys suffer from pretty severe depression. And the more people we talked to, we had Carrie Santa Maria on last week who was a friend of ours. He's very, very smart, very brilliant woman, and also a neuroscientist. So, you know, she's not talking out of her ass when she explains what's going on in the human brain. It's just a fucking disease, man. It's a disease. And anybody that doesn't have it that talks out of their ass, you know, like fucking what's his face? Henry Rollins said that it was like week that he killed himself because he had kids. Not that these people, you know, I, I see that they want to take a stand because they find it offensive that Pete people would be in their eyes what they would consider so selfish that they committed suicide.

Speaker 1:          00:25:29       But I think in talking to people that have had it, I think it's pretty safe to assume they're telling you the truth, that they can't do it. They can't keep going. Like these motherfuckers when, when they don't get help, when they don't get some sort of a chemical help or, you know, whatever, whatever it needs to be done, whether it's at some sort of a mental imbalance, whether it can be mitigated with exercise or diet, but whatever that state they're in, when they hit the bottom, they can't go on. Man. It's, I don't, I don't understand it. I don't have it. I don't get depressed.

Speaker 2:          00:26:01       Yeah. I get it to you in the morning. Yeah. Uh, then it kind of worked my way out of it. Uh, the jerky way out of it. Your to put way up and I stay in little things in my house. I come here, come here kitty. Uh, you hit a bell with Jenny. It could see something coming. Jenny. Like he was like, Richard is always very neat. It was all disheveled last time I saw him and Eleanor is such, you saw him at a, uh, like a supermarket. He was knocking over things in the shelves. It was like, oh. So the drugs were fucking him up. What drugs was young? Somebody anti psychotic drugs and he was supposed to change the prescription that week. You know, I don't know which stories are true but Robin, that the

Speaker 1:          00:26:44       big difference was there was no indication. Well apparently not. But Mark Gordon, who's a, this God is doctor that have had on the podcast before sent me this piece that he's working on, on the high instances of a suicide in relationship to a operations and that people need to, yeah, that's what over and said. He was saying that they need to accept that there's an issue going on with people's hormonal balances that get thrown out of whack by a pretty severe operation like heart surgery. And he cited the instances of a hypothyroidism that can be caused by it. And then the pituitary gland function, uh, especially being under for a long time when they do like those, uh, like what Joan Rivers just had done, they put her under for a long time and now she's still in like critical care. She's gonna me. Yeah. Yeah. She's fucked apparently.

Speaker 1:          00:27:36       When you, um, when you, uh, get put under for like long periods of time, they do something like open heart surgery, which they did with Robin. It can be really tricky, like when you come out of it, like it's like some pretty severe depression occurs in a lot of people. So if he didn't, if people didn't see it coming before you got that factor, you also have the drug factor that he, he recently checked himself back into Rehab again. He said it was no reason to, it was just like reaffirming his commitment to sobriety. But that sounds like some PR, right. People's idea of what to say for me. Yeah. Don't tell him, don't tell him you really fucked up again. Yeah. I mean, he didn't get, he didn't get caught drunk driving or anything like that. Whatever it is, he decided to check himself and again, and so there's all those things.

Speaker 1:          00:28:21       And you know, he also had a lot of debt, you know, you know what? A lot of money, but he was very wealthy still. I talked to his agent who's a friend of mine and she was saying, don't let all these people tell you that he, um, he owed more money than he had. He had plenty of money. He just has this like $30 million house in Napa. He say she say like a 600 acre estate, like has some crazy fucking park essentially in Napa and it's, you know, $30 million. So, but she said he's still, he was still rich when he died. Then you can't say it was that. It was, um, you know, when someone owes money, like they have a mortgage, it's not you, it's not like you can't pay that money. It's just more strategic. Like as far as like how much interest you can earn on your money.

Speaker 1:          00:29:06       It's smarter in a lot of cases to like keep paying it off like as a mortgage than it is just spend the, you know, whatever he owed on it. Like it was 20 million bucks or something like that. Take the $20 million out of his money. But she's like, he could have done that if you want it to. So it wasn't like he was in broke at all, but a lot of people thought that had that had an issue too. Just the fact that he's the failed relationships is depressing. And you know, I know his first wife very well, but you know the thing about him when he won the Academy Award, I'll never forget it because it was liquid Jamie Foxx when I go, wow, we beat the grownups. You know what I mean? It's like

Speaker 3:          00:29:42       because like they would have ever takes, I mean they were both series parts but nobody ever takes comedian seriously for Academy Awards and Mike Meyers in Austin Powers. To me it was Academy Award winning performance. I really believe that at that level because it was funny to me is anything, but anyway, Robin was so fucking talented I think about that was a very talented actor man. That movie a one hour photo and you ever see that creepy fucking movie man? People saw that one. Yeah it was a no, it was more of an independent. That was one of the things that he was talking about why he wound up doing that television show. It was because it was an independent film situation where he was like constantly getting these offers to do these films and they barely even had funding and if they pay they paid scale and they were interested was interesting jobs but he was like the, the big movies had kind of dried up for him for whatever reason. Like sometimes guys will, those movie star guys will go on these peaks and vowels. Definitely like Kevin Costner and he started doing movies recently, but I remember after waterworld, it's like a long fucking time before anybody put that guy on a big movie again.

Speaker 4:          00:30:45       Did you actually see Robin's new show? Uh, unfortunately I watched a few episodes of it and I understand why. I think it didn't work. It just seemed very, very cheesy and I'm, maybe that might've been one of Robin's things that because he was still playing a character that never really progressed in a way like,

Speaker 3:          00:31:05       Yep. So catch up on Seinfeld and there was a, what do you mean by a character that never really progressed?

Speaker 4:          00:31:10       Because [inaudible] if you ever see Robin Williams like on the tonight show or any of those shows, he, he always does the same act where it's very frenetic. Yeah. Very crazy and very like, you almost can guess what he's about to do next, you know? And to me it was, I loved it, but I also thought that when it was converted into a show was pretty flexible too much. It was just like, all right, this is so unrealistic. Do that when he was on more commending. Right? Yeah, that's what I'm saying now. It's kind of like, well, the difference is he's 60 now.

Speaker 3:          00:31:40       Yeah. That was 30 years ago. Can't be a 30 you could be a 30 year old guy and be like, oh fuck, I'm craze craze are [inaudible] I'm from another planet. But when you're 60 you know,

Speaker 4:          00:31:49       it's kind of like Jim Carrey doesn't do Jim Carrey in as much anymore. Like Ace Ventura. Yeah. Like if he was still doing ace Ventura, then you know, then you made it a sick home with a laugh track. It's like, oh, the loop

Speaker 3:          00:32:03       man on the moon when he did a, is that, what is it called? The uh, yeah, yeah, we did the Andy Kaufman. Yeah. Like that was a great performance. That was an Oscar worthy performance. I mean, he really nailed Andy Kaufman and was really, he really was Andy Kaufman's Rosie. He did a great job. But like when he does the ace Ventura stuff, you can't really do that when you're 50 years old or whatever it is. It's probably like 50 right, right. You can't really do that. Nobody wants to see you get out of breath. Prat falls. Well, didn't Chevy chase like fuck himself up from pratfalls? Gerald Ford, he used to Ford falling all the time. He was the president at the time because it's got in Chevy chase was only on for I think one year. Really. Then Benny and it became that famous over that, that one year where he was the first star.

Speaker 3:          00:32:50       Yeah. From Saturday night live. Right? Yeah. Huh. But apparently all those pratfalls we're really a, well, I've heard that. I heard that about the three stooges to those guys were like punchy towards the end of their career because they would smacking each other so much, you know, uh, getting hit with shit. What's it? What's it guys? They'd from Jackass. A steevo. No, and that's the way Johnny, I saw him, I seen him at the gym sometime. Right. We were talking, I said, it's really cool. You know, you guys are trained and stuntmen stuff because we don't know a fucking thing. This is where just a bunch of assholes. I started that. I didn't know that. I thought they knew what they were doing. Their fucking crazy. Yeah. That's not a smart thing to do what they're doing and alligator's biting your balls. No, they got lucky.

Speaker 3:          00:33:36       They got lucky that no one ever died doing that show and then one guy died. They're getting lucky still. They're doing it still. Like they're still filming stuff together and doing like, I hate think they might even be doing another jackass. What happened with Steven when he painted that sign near seaworld? Seaworld socks. He climbed up, fell a bunch of times. She want to watch it online. I mean, I don't know if he fell on purpose. He's just just being a silly goose. The way climbs assign climbs a sign, it falls from like fucking 30 feet up and lands on the ground and socio survives to visit and to see him do stand up. No, it's bizarre. Yeah. Well he does like tell stories, right? Yeah. But he also like did some physical stuff. He tries to fall and stuff. That's what I saw with the live factory.

Speaker 3:          00:34:20       I don't know if that's part of his real act, but some of it involves fire depending on the comedy club, you know, and in the fire fight, fire licenses. He does a lot of different acts. Like he grew up, I've Ringling brothers Barney, he graduated from their college, so he used to be in the circus. A lot of his shit's like, so he was Lisa. You imagine if you have a fucking business. It worked real hard to put together a comedy club. You hire waitstaff, you get everything. We're up and running and steevo comes to town. He asked you if he could do fire on stage and you see your life falling apart for one fucking Thursday, November and you're like, no, no fire dude, no fire. And then he's got the fire. Anyway, like I wrote it, I wrote it. I mean cause a fire big.

Speaker 3:          00:35:02       Yeah. One day that's not going to work. One day something's going to go bad doing fucking getting hit by bowls and get launched into the air with a blindfold on. You see that? This was after Johnny Knoxville was a movie star. He was already in movies with the Rock. Remember he did that movie with the rock after that puts a blindfold on and let's, I'll fucking bull launch him into the air. Unbelievable. And flips like head over heels, like can easily land on his neck and these guys expend so much energy. There are very mild. I you talk to them, it very low key. Jim Carrey's like that. Jim Carrey, he's like, you know, he's the wacky guy and then these are you ever talked to him is he's so like mellow and down there it's like Steve Martin, he's almost shy and doesn't really like to even talk to people.

Speaker 3:          00:35:46       Right. He was, yeah, he was such a Dick to me. Uh, I was doing see was. Yeah. He's like, I mean, you know, I was doing this thing for comedy central where I'll be for the awards shows. We would interview people and everybody was nice. Jerry Lewis, Garry Shandling, all these guys, Steve Martin just, we asked him if we could interview. He said yeah, and then he wouldn't, he wouldn't give me one word answers. And your surreal smug. I'm picking your fucking career was predicated by putting an Arrow three ahead. Don't don't act so slick with me. Why is he acting slick with clumpy? Don't do the interview if you're going to be like that. Yeah, that's too bad. That's too bad. I, I think he was brilliant. Oh, I knew as a comic. I mean the, the, let's get some all, all that stuff. Alright, brilliant. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:36:29       I think what happened to him, no, is overload. Like if you talk to him, like have you listened to him rather talk about it. He talks about how it got to a point where he can go on stage and anything. He did. People laugh so he couldn't figure out what was funny anymore. They were just so happy to see him and he was like, this is crazy. So he just pulled out, pulled out a comedy. Stop doing standup. That word crazy. If you couldn't do that because, yeah, I don't know. I mean I guess I could really, I wouldn't have watched it up. Don't stand up. I could, I wouldn't want to, but I could. Yeah, I could. You know what, I, there's a lot of things I want to do, man. I like doing stuff, you know, like I'm writing a lot now. Um, especially in writing law stand up because I'm getting ready to do like a whole new hour.

Speaker 3:          00:37:09       I've got to put together a whole new hour. So it's really exciting. But I'm also, I just started writing a book to writing a script. I wrote this, not a script, a another book. I'll like a horror book. Um, I'm a monster movie book, so I'm like, I know a bunch of shit I like to do. So if someone said you can't do standup anymore, I be like, man, when miss stand up, but I got to do all this other shit. Like I don't have the, I don't have that distraction. I'm like busy. So for me, if I do only one thing, it doesn't, it doesn't sit well for me. Well you have a career nobody else has. I mean with the, the, the fights and everything, it just, the way your career, where you're acting, you know, I mean there are people that watch fear factor.

Speaker 3:          00:37:50       They didn't know you were stand up. Yeah, I did a lot of things that didn't make any sense. You know, they don't go together like being a standup and be in a cage fighting commentator. They don't really go together. That could it fucking great at that man. It's fun, but you love it and you know about it and you break it down for people, you know. I mean, I know you don't watch football, but I watch a lot of football and this Guy John Gruden, do you watch football? He's don't want, he's talks about bubbles, screens and all this shit. I Dunno. What the fuck are you still going about? You can break it down so that a common person could understand what's going on. Well, this is a thing that sports casters would like to do to let you know that they're in the know.

Speaker 3:          00:38:27       They use obscure lingo and jargon and they do it on purpose. Like I've heard guys do it with MMA. They were like, yeah, he's going to hit him with the two, three, five Combo. Fuck is that, I don't even know what that is. Everybody's is different. By the way, you can't say that because here's your standard two three to a two is a right hand. Uh, three's a hook. So it's jab is a one, two is a right hand. Three's a hook. But different camps do different shit. Like some camps have the like hit him with the Aldo. They'll come up with names for combinations that come up with names for certain techniques. Like a shovel hook is the razor Ruddock, the Razor Ruddock you know, and they'll, they'll have different numbers. Like instead of one, two, three, they'll do it backwards. You know, they'll have like a 10 strike combination from like 10 being the head kick, nine being the need of the body's seven being the elbow to the head, you know, they'll have like a bunch of them.

Speaker 3:          00:39:16       So they'll, they'll have their own system so that no one knows what the fuck. Like if you, you're in someone's corner, uh, and you're yelling at him with a, to hit him in the, to, the guy's going to look out for the right hand. But if two is a roundhouse kick instead, or we'll kick or something else, you know, no one, they won't know. So like everybody mixes things up. So when someone's like, you know, I think the two three is going to be big for him in this fight. Like fuck you, what are you doing? You're just letting everybody know you're inside. That's all you're doing. You're just, you're, you're giving them nonsense sports guy talk and you can't do that with fighting. You know, there's a lot of sports guy talk, they like to insult like athletes. I'd like to insult players, you know, there's like a certain amount of that, but they don't tolerate, people don't tolerate that.

Speaker 3:          00:39:55       And MMA, it's a totally different kind of sport. The people that have been like really insulting about athletes, really insulting about like you like calling them losers or fat or whatever. Those people all get ostracized. They all get pushed out because there's such a tremendous, like the emotional burden of fighting. It's respected. More the like there's going to be people that mock people when they lose, but a lot of those people were fucking teenagers. A little kids. People don't know about life. But as far as like journalists, the Ma, the v, the vast majority of ones it like super negative journalists. They get ostracized, which I think is a good thing. I'll tell you what, the time that you invited us in Montreal, so that was the French Canadian guy, George Saint Pierre. That was one of the most exciting moments I've ever felt in my life.

Speaker 3:          00:40:42       But a positive energy. Yeah, it's fucking incredible. That was wild. Yeah, there are always wild and thank God he won. Yeah. Can't imagine if he had lost, but then plus the crowd was so much class here, cause I've gone to like professional wrestling years ago and they will look like the we'll cross side and they'll look, I skate on his face. Don't say that to Tony Hinchcliffe. We'll get fucking angry. Really hit it with the boy. Tony Hinchcliffe was reading a book the other day, a fucking pro wrestling book on the insides of the business. He subscribes to the channel and just sits there and watches every single wrestlemania over. And he was trying to explain to me how they write the story arcs and about, he was right though. The Brock Lesnar was going to beat John Cena. Like you told me how it was going to happen. It was going to happen.

Speaker 3:          00:41:26       I didn't know anything. I don't know anything man. Marcy's going lifted. It's a show. Well they had to, they had to, uh, for a bunch of reasons. I think they had to for like tax purposes like that it's entertainment, sports, you know, it probably costs them money, but I think they had to also because otherwise they could be accused of fixing contests. So they think they had us change it from being a sport to being entertainment. People didn't give a fuck though. They don't care. Stop the ratings at all. I think it's funny when the punch lands like a foot away from the guy's face, guy goes flying. Oh yeah. Well they beat the fuck out of each other for real too though. They do hit each other. Oh, well they're good athletes. I mean just flipping in the air and landed on your butt.

Speaker 3:          00:42:08       I had to hit Kevin. James would have punch on, uh, on his show. I can't queens. And I was so upset because my left hand is so much better than my right, but I through this kind of have a fag punch with my right hand and he goes flying down. Why did you have to throw a right? Because they didn't accept southpaw. Yeah, they wouldn't, they the camera thing, whatever it was. Sons of bitches. I know that's ridiculous. You should have your ground. But he'd say, look, I'm a lefty. I wasn't in a position to Joe who was a guest star was, it wasn't exactly an executive producer director to fucking damn which it around. Maybe we can go back and change it. We should go back and post film upside down. Brian knows Photoshop switch that around is a clever little son of a bitches.

Speaker 3:          00:42:49       So when you threw the punch, when you threw the punch, how far away from him were you at that far? And it looked like I hit him really? And he went down and he comes up with all ketchup in his mouth and I accidentally hit a guy in a scene in a, we're doing that hardball show. I threw a punch and they threw like a beer. I think it was my face or fake beer and uh, and I was supposed to hit him afterwards, but because like the fake beer hit my face, I was like temporarily blinded and I tried to like do it like in front of his face or to the side of his face and I accidentally like nick dumb. I felt so bad. I didn't hurt him, but it was just like, what an idiot. And of all people, I used to do demonstrations, pulling punches people's face and I accidentally hit this guy.

Speaker 3:          00:43:34       Do you VHS copies of this show and can I transfer the ball line? I probably have a couple. There's no, there's the only thing I've ever been able to find is like one or two screenshots. Sony took it to where they drop all that nuclear waste in Nevada. They opened up some canisters and they dropped all the master tapes in the nuclear waste so that no one would ever see. It wasn't Sony Disney, Disney Fox. That was the first gig. You have one first clearing your head. Yeah. If it wasn't for that I nothing else. So like I would've never gotten news radio. We're never gotten any of those things because I got news radio cause I, it was still out here. And the reason why I was out here is for that hardball show. I've, if I, if it wasn't for me signing a lease because I wasn't going to sign a lease, like I was just going to rent at the Oakwood. Yeah. You know the oakwoods is a thing that everybody does in la. We get when you're getting separated from your wife, that's too, well, it's um, everybody does in la when you move to town because they'll sell their rent. You a furnished place, like it already has a TV, has cable, it has a bed

Speaker 1:          00:44:32       and you can kind of, it's almost like a, like you move into an apartment that's somebody else's shit is there, it's not bad. Like, you know, they had paintings on the walls and like, it, it feels like an apartment. That's what I got when I first was here, but it was like, it was too depressing. There's too many weird people. There was like a lot of weirdness. There's like discombobulated souls wandering around there and I just, I didn't enjoy the energy. And so, uh, like any idiot who's 25 years old, it's convinced as television show's going to go, I'm like, this fucking show's going to go. I got a lease on an apartment, you know, I rented an apartment like a fucking moron. And, uh, I signed the lease and, uh, I bought a TV and set it out. I didn't even have a couch. I was watching TV on the ground and um, then the fucking chuck are canceling. I'm like, Shit, I'm stuck out here. I was totally ready to go back to you.

Speaker 2:          00:45:21       Can you imagine if that would would have happened, what your life would be totally different. Yeah. I would have been a dancer. I would have been an answer. Natalie needs a nightie. I just would have concentrated on that

Speaker 1:          00:45:31       stand up. I mean, I've already done standup TV or are they already done Caroline's comedy hour. I'd already done MTV half hour comedy hour. I was already headlining nationally, so I was already making money as a comic. It was like just when it was starting to work for me, so I probably would have just concentrated more on stand up. But yeah, definitely would have been different. I never would have been on something like news radio, that's for sure.

Speaker 2:          00:45:50       Where you're working in Dunkin donuts and tower seven who knows? I wasn't working in Dunkin donuts when I was 19 I remember bringing you up Montreal when the club Soda. Yeah, that was before I was on anything. That was a long time. You are a completely different kind of comedian were, I mean you were, you were always good, but you were different and you didn't have, you didn't invest the energy that I remember that you could do late later on with the new rules. Why wasn't, I just wasn't that good? You know, pretty good. I was okay. I just didn't know how to be the best version of me, you know what I mean? But, but he didn't have any insight either. That was the other thing. I was 24 25 when we met, you know, when we first hit Montreal, like was it like 92 or something like that?

Speaker 2:          00:46:36       I Dunno, I something like that somewhere around then. But I didn't, you know, I was an idiot of just me being on stage. It's just like a ridiculous proposition. Like who the fuck is this guy? Why is he allowed to talk? You know, so I, you know what I mean? Well, I don't, I think it'd be in tough with yourself. You were, you were pretty good. You just weren't, I mean, now you're just so confident. The energy's all there, you know? It's like he, I mean, I don't know if people get too comfortable, but you can see it, you know how you have like a minute or like a half a minute or on stage where there's just, it's just like thinking there's something you were comfortable with that now you, you weren't comfortable with that then I met then and neither was I.

Speaker 1:          00:47:16       Right. And what you mean? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Those, yeah, the pauses and just being in your own skin and the audience can sense when you're not comfortable. It makes them uncomfortable. Then the whole thing goes wacky. Yeah. Plus then like

Speaker 3:          00:47:30       if anything went wrong, the fucking show was over. I never, I never pulled myself out of a downward spiral ever. Like I would do great. Great, great. Eh, like once it started going down, the ship was going to hit the rocks. There was no getting out of that. Save yourself. We'll see what, I had the Improv in those clubs in New York. Where did you develop? Um, well, mostly Boston up until, I guess it was right around the time I met you. I was moving to New York. It was 92 ish, somewhere around there. I lived in New York from 92 to 94 and in [inaudible] 94 I was already going back and forth to la, but I'm nine. All that like 88 to 90 ish night maybe. I guess it was 1991. All that was in Boston. And it was, a lot of, it was, uh, working all these, uh, outside bar gigs, the bar gigs and clubs.

Speaker 3:          00:48:19       Do you remember when it clicked them for you? Honestly, as a professional, I don't think, it wasn't until I was like 10 years in, you know, when I did my first, uh, comedy CD, which is a, I'm going to be dead some day. I did it at the Houston livestock. I did that 99. That was when I was, I felt comfortable enough with what I had to put it on a CD. And the, I listened to it today, I cringe, but it felt comfortable enough after 10 years in like, I think I can release something, you know? So that's uh, that was one, but I still am, I, I feel I'm better now than I was two years ago. I know I am. I'm, I'm working on it more. I work at it more and more excited by it. I wasn't that happy with my last special, I was when I put it out and then when I started going over and I was like, I could've done this better.

Speaker 3:          00:49:04       I was too with doing too many different things, you know? But this one I did stand up like every night I did stand up like Sundays. I did Tuesdays, I took Mondays off, but almost every week I was doing Tuesday at the Haha Wednesday at the Improv. Oh fuck. Yeah. It does. It does. I look like I looked at my act now, the body of my work, if I may, and I know, I think, who the fuck wrote this? Yeah. Because how did they get this? But Shit, I couldn't let go. I had to write. Sometimes I think like, you know, she goes to, they do. They do. You're right. A lot of go. Yeah. I write every day. The problem is not, it's not that funny other than that. Um, prolific, well that's the difference sheet. The guy like you and someone who is not disciplined.

Speaker 3:          00:49:46       Like some people, they sit down and they write and it's not good and they just go, ah, fuck it. And they stopped writing and they'll take days off and they won't. Right. But you got to show up. If you show up, the stuff shows up. It's really that simple. You know, I had a guy on the podcast yesterday, his named Sam Harris. He's a brilliant guy and neurosurgeon or neuroscientists rather and uh, knows a lot about the human mind. And he was arguing, I'm not arguing, but explaining the idea of determinism that uh, there is no real freewill and that everything you do is a combination of your genes, your life experiences, the environment that you're in. All these, it was really, really interesting argument. Not Ours. There's no free will. Yeah, he's saying there's no

Speaker 1:          00:50:28       free will. Um, I see what he's saying. I see what he's saying. He's saying that the reason why you act the way you act is essentially based on all these factors that you have no control over, like your genes, your life experiences, all these different things. But as a comic, um, I dunno, I guess it's all those things that are leading me to invest more energy into it right now, but like, whatever it is, you know, I don't freewill whatever the fuck it is that's causing me to be excited about it. Now I'm as excited if not more excited by standup right now than I ever have been ever. I could see that. I get so much more for you get on stage and you were already like in a good mood because you're on stage. I think I'm appreciating how awesome a Gig it is too. [inaudible] I can never lost appreciation for it, but I, you know, I compare it to other things.

Speaker 2:          00:51:23       Oh wait, the other thing is for me, it's crossing generations. I appreciate that so much. And uh, like, I mean, you're gonna quiz shows like yours help a lot, but it's amazing to me. I was in Montreal, true story. Stop me if you heard this. Oh, oh. I was in Montreal and this girl and her mother said that they were related to come up to me and wanted to fuck. They wanted that. It suck my fucking, oh, he goes, the kid was nervous, you know, and she said, are you dom Herrera? I go, yeah. And then she gets a quick get a picture. I said, of course. And so the mother walks away to get a camera and the father, I said, there were, how old are you? She goes, 12 I go 12 and this is because of the Internet, you know, I said, and you know me.

Speaker 2:          00:52:08       She goes, I said, on, she goes, listen man, she called me. Dude, you could listen dude. I've ever, I've been a fan of yours since I was seven. I said seven. I don't, I didn't know I had had any single digit fans. Wow. And that incredible. That's wild. A 12 year old has been a fan since they were seven. And she says, funny is funny. And I said, you know, we're so different, which different generations, different worlds. And she said, I said, well, I can't believe your parents would let you watch a pig. Like she goes, well, you know the Internet. You can watch anything dominant. Six years are going to be fucking her. That's where it gets dark. I look forward to that show. You will too. I know I need two years to get hard now. Play. You gave me these six years. Heads up. Just save up the lows. Oh boy. Don't have any of those three quarter erection ejaculation. No. That's a limp. Dick lead. Jerk it off of the limp Dick and you calm anyway and you're like, oh no. Why are those words the funniest words? Limp Dick is, I used all over the vogue limp. Dick is always limp. Dick is floods. It's embarrassing. It's inherently, I wouldn't know. Never the El Pomar now. Whoa. Yeah. Just hey, you're like Liberace. Liberace. I one of his balls was a pump was or air

Speaker 3:          00:53:26       Max. I'm not kidding. No, I'm not kidding. Yeah, you gotta pump [inaudible]. There's a thing that guys do when they get erectile dysfunction that a, they used to do that. Just talking about it. I don't know about that. I've heard that a stone like the lion, the glass white girls shit on him. I thought that was dating a guy at heard Danny Thomas. I was him to together. They jerk each other off while they watched it, but that's not a really shit at the fair. It's that shit. It's shit. No to table. Yeah, but the biological, you know you're watching it expand and you watch it. Yeah. It's like when a little kid plays a plate out and they have the factory and they winded up and it comes out. That's with like, you were the one that told me about that a long time ago when we first started looking up, shared on the Internet that some Japanese guys getting shit on and what isn't.

Speaker 3:          00:54:11       A lot of videos of people that would like shit in each other's mouths and stuff and you can't believe it's real, but when you watch it, there's some fake ones like two girls, one cup they like put ice cream up their ass or whatever the fuck they put up there. That wasn't exactly shit. Eight parents that you can get some severe diabetes from that get all that sugar up your butt hole. But I don't think they're concerned about those girls. The first worry, there's plenty of videos though of people eating shit. It's apparently it's a genre. You know, some folks enjoy watching it. I've had it in my mouth once like, oh, oh, because he's thinking about asking. He's like, I shouldn't let me need let me. Oh No, no need. No need to know or knew her very well. He was sleeping in the same bed as her.

Speaker 3:          00:54:58       You do a bid on that? Yeah. Okay. And then I thought I heard it before. It's a true story. True story with my happy stories. The truth gets dark out there. That's interesting that that's a weird fetish. That wasn't his idea that just an accident. She was an accident. Right. Some people through shit and he chose his mouth like, go, okay, let's meet here at two o'clock and I'm a shit in your mouth. Yes. Get to that point. How do you do on every pair of perversion there is. So you get to that point. Well, that's why would Sam Harris says it's so fascinating is if determinism is true, that means that you're not even responsible for letting someone shit in your mouth. It's like all these variables have played a part in your being who you are at this moment, lying there on the stainless steel table by this Japanese guy hovers over your face. Should have been he's guy. Yeah, he pulls it, pulls us a sack up. So's balls. Don't get shit on and dumps one. Write down your fucking mind.

Speaker 3:          00:56:00       I don't know why. I don't know. I don't know a lot of things though. I don't understand the grateful dead. You know why there's such a phenomena. I don't get why anybody listens to that and likes it. I don't get it. I understand that you like it, but I'm just being honest. No, I don't like not you, but anybody who's listening to this, like I get like sunk trucking. I get a touch of gray. I've, I've, I've heard a bunch of that are pretty good, but to be a dead is a little over the top. My cousin traveled around the country with them. I used to used to travel the country. I mean it went to three shows, but we got, but he died right when I got into them. Of course it all that so funny. He's like, fuck this guy, I'm just going to kill myself right there.

Speaker 3:          00:56:38       Also about though, what a lot of people forget is that it was also people that you knew that also like the smoke marijuana when it was really, really illegal. So it was like this group thing of like, Hey, we all like to do psychedelics and mushrooms and smoke weed and that's awesome. Yeah. Well there's also a thing that happens when you're on a drug, when you listen to something where it just sounds totally different than if you're not on that drug. That's a, that's a reality that I experienced recently with um, with what's called an ECO row. An ICO is this thing that, uh, the play when there's, um, Iowasca ceremonies are going on and if you, uh, you take DMT and you listen to this [inaudible], you see these things like play out in front of you. Tony is going to talk about it tomorrow. Tony and I will talk about it tomorrow cause we did it together in Texas, in Texas with these ECO rose. But it's this crazy fucking sound that's um, that's playing that is like, it's, it's really wild because the sound's somehow or another effects the music or the, the images you see rather this is it.

Speaker 3:          00:57:52       This is all these shamans in the Amazon and they play this and while you're on DMT and you do this, the images and these like elves in this hallucination or whatever you want to call it, they dance to this music and it's fucking crazy, man. It makes the whole thing that makes the whole thing even more bizarre. But what's weird is that these songs were actually designed to be used that way. They were all made by these trippers and the Amazon and they're all using like rattles and shit and they're whistling like, listen to this.

Speaker 3:          00:58:36       It sounds like really simple music, right? If you listen to that, and I'm like, dude, you need to download this and be like, bitch, get the fuck outta here. I'm listening to some asshole whistle and slap his thought. But if you, if you listened to it when you're under the influence of DMT, it's amazing. It's like they danced to the music. It's really, really weird with all psychedelics though. Music is very, very important with mushrooms and everything. Cause I've really changed a whole mission trip before just on the music I listened to being like pink Floyd or doing some kind of more like a drum type stuff. Uh, I think that would kill me. Yeah, I'm serious. I think if I took mushrooms or anything hallucinogenic, I'm so close to the fucking edge anyway. The I need like tranquilizers. You're that close to the edge. Well as far as that account

Speaker 2:          00:59:22       Aerosmith something long when the world today, I don't know what it is. Something wrong.

Speaker 5:          00:59:34       This is one of my favorites. I like that. It's kind of like

Speaker 2:          00:59:40       the last thing you hear when walking down a dark alley about to get raped by some guy was tricking them. But we feel he didn't really even think that he just went with that because he thought it'd be an interesting thing to say. The first one I did cause I was thinking of a guy whistling and you know like walking slowly down an alley, stroking his car. That'd be terrible if it guy was raping you while doing this. If you just have your mind went there and you're getting raped by dragons and patterns.

Speaker 3:          01:00:08       Have you hallucinated when right now have you listen to it? What do you mean? In real life or drugs, but drugs. Yeah. Yeah. Hello? I don't know. I don't know if I'm really seeing Elvis. Maybe I'm really seeing now is, but I'm assuming that it's a Luiseno pot. No. Well you can if you eat it, if you eat it and you close your eyes, you definitely hallucinate for sure. If you eat a large dose, like if you have like a cookie, like a strong cookie and then you lay down and close your eyes, you see bizarre shit that would scare the shit out of him. It should. It's, but that's a, that's a part of the whole thing is that it scares the shit out of you. And then when it's over you feel better. I was asking Joey Diaz last night about, I said, do you ever go a day without eating pot? It goes, yeah, of course I do. I said, does it bother? He goes, no, I smoke. I tried it once in the 60s. It's overrated. Yeah. He um, he's taken it to another level. He definitely, he does take, you know, he takes days off of edibles. Animals can fuck with you man. They can, they can give you panic attacks. I've been with Joey when he was

Speaker 2:          01:01:14       getting like a panic attack. We were on a plane really? And is he in these things called Chiba Chews and we tell you about Chiba Chews my rare, right. I don't ever eat a whole cheat, but you, I mean, ever, ever.

Speaker 6:          01:01:28       So Joey, three of them, the re, oh my gosh. Chiba Chews war. If you a three Chiba Chews and you listen to this and you close your eyes, you would see the most bizarre shit ever. Dancing fluorescent cartoon characters, fucking and creating new cartoon characters that are separating and dividing like cells. You'd see your whole childhood play out in a cartoon form, like a comic strip. He could see anything. You will hallucinate. Like that's a massive, massive dose of ta. Now how did he walk from the plane to the car? He did and he sat in that plane for five hours and we flew across the country and Atlanta go Joe Rogan. I almost had a fucking panic on that plane. Was He okay by the time we landed, basically, yeah, he recovers quickly. Thc when you will, marijuana when you eat it produces a psychoactive chemical called 11 hydroxy metabolite and it's about five times more psychoactive than THC.

Speaker 6:          01:02:35       It's much more like mushrooms, much more like I'm much more like a psychedelic than marijuana because marijuana is, it gives you high. But um, that five hydroxy will fucking kick your dig into the dirt. It's one of the reasons why when people eat cookies, they always say, oh, it was laced, man, it was laced. That wasn't lace. That's what happens when you eat a lot of it. Especially I, one of the most frightening moments in my life. I took, I took a marijuana pill and I was talking to this guy that turned out to be a rapist. Turned out to eventually, he eventually went to jail for rape. He was a Brazilian Jiu Jitsu belt and, uh, he, uh, he fled while he was on this, uh, under, you know, they were looking for him cause he fled and moved to the Pacific northwest, started doing Jujitsu again even though they were looking for him, couldn't stop doing Jujitsu cause he likes to do it so much.

Speaker 6:          01:03:27       And uh, I was at this, uh, grappling event and he had competed in this grappling event and I had taken this pill and I was way too high to be out in public. This was, it was confusing. It was like really like, whoa. It was one of the first times I was ever really, really big. But he, in this, he and I were talking and when we were talking I was like, wow, there's a distinct like different thing going on with this guy. Like this guy has like, uh, there's, uh, an ability to do things that this guy has like in his head that might not necessarily be good things. Like if you were with this guy in a street fight, he might like stomp somebody to death. You know what I mean? Like you might see him do that. Like don't do it. Stop doing it.

Speaker 6:          01:04:12       You know, like he wouldn't, I don't, you know, there was like an edge that he had that he had crossed over and I was feeling that when I was on, on the pills and then like a couple months later the guy goes to jail or gets indicted and you know, and then flees and then wants up going to jail later when he's still doing Jujitsu because they had found him in some school. Well cause he's a really high level black belt is not that many guys that are tapable of tapping out other black balls. So when some guy comes in your school out of nowhere and he started strangling your instructor, everybody's like, well what the fuck is going on? Who's this guy? You've tried to pretend he was some guy from Brazil and everybody's like, but he's American. The fuck's going on. He's in jail now. He's in jail now. Yeah, but as those God damn pills, I saw him to his soul. I didn't like it dumb. I don't even like hearing it. That's true because I'm going to get it over the air, but in the context of that story is a song any better? Yeah. I like this.

Speaker 6:          01:05:17       Oh, you

Speaker 3:          01:05:18       don't like it? Your highest fucking, you hear this is the greatest song of all time. That's why I downloaded it. I, how do I keep it? I wanted it to be a part of my life where they say what language are they singing? Anything or just making noises. There's, there's a, there's words to it. I don't know what the words are to this one. There's words to it. Obviously the other ones didn't know from the Amazon. Yeah, yeah. That's, that's the real deal. Peruvian. So I guess it must be a some form of a, I don't know what I mean, it's not Spanish native. Yeah, but Peru, they speak Spanish mostly. I think they speak a bunch of different layers of a native tongue and the Amazon and a couple of wild shit, man, that's crazy place to live. But this is their technology. This is the, the technology that they've invented to try to

Speaker 3:          01:06:05       enhance or change these psychedelic trips that they go on. Very, very weird. You ever get stuck in one you think you can't get out of, get out of it? No. Um, I've gotten, um, but I had one that I did a few years back that, uh, fucked me up for a couple of weeks afterwards. It was so intense that for a couple of weeks afterwards I was really worried that like reality itself had gone. The way I described it was, it was, it reality was too slippery. Like it didn't, the, it didn't make sense. Like I get these thoughts in my head, like I'd be driving on the highway. I'm like, what if a car flips the divide and comes towards me right now? Like I'm like, what am I thinking this, you know? And I think where were you working on then knowing this or fear factor? No, it was post fear factor. Um, so nothing just doing stand up. Oh, okay. Oh you're still at the comedy store because I remember you talking to me about this and wasn't, so that was 2007 maybe 2006 maybe wasn't that long ago?

Speaker 7:          01:07:03       Yeah.

Speaker 3:          01:07:04       Yeah. Cause we stopped going to the comedy store at 2007. I feel like it was post that Brian, that's so long ago. Yeah, I think that bet on the wrong horse. It doesn't make any sense. I remember we were in the back alley behind where I had a few that fucked me up. I don't know if this is the same. Big Life is slippery and you were like, you just saw a ghost and I'm like did you do this last night? And you're like, no, this is like four days ago. And I'm like, what? I'm not sure if our timelines are correct here. Anyway. That's not important. The important thing was it took about, I think what was going on for about two weeks after this experience was that it was so ego shattering but the, the, the, the psychedelic trip was so it's so like changed my idea of what was important and my position like in my own universe, like instead of me being the center of my own universe, I became like just this piece in this gigantic fractal. Like it was, it was very weird. And it, if you're, you know, you're clinging to this idea, like what makes you successful, what makes you push forward? Well, I know you personally, I know you enjoy killing. You like going up there and, and, and you like being a great comic. You know, there's

Speaker 1:          01:08:16       a reason why you're a great comic. You've worked at it, you like it, you enjoy it, you go up, you do it and you take pride in that. Well, when you have like a really intense psychedelic experience, one of the weird things that happens is like your idea of who you are, like the youth thing that you part of it, which was so natural and normal kind of like dissolves. So I think my ego by worrying about all this shit by like, like worrying about cars flipping into my lane or weird things happening. It was almost like my ego was trying to present me with a bunch of different dangers. And though these dangers, you have to prepare for these, so you have to worry about yourself. You have to think about yourself. So it's like, it was trying to counterbalance the destructive ego, destructive properties of the psychedelic.

Speaker 1:          01:09:00       Like the psychedelic was saying, listen, you can tweak out all you want about shit. But here's the reality. The reality is you're a part of something that's infinite and it goes on forever. It's infinite in size and it's infinite in length and it's fractal. It folds into itself and expands on to infinity. And you can, you could pretend you're important all day long, but you're not there. It's impossible for you. You're a part of the universal soup of not just consciousness but of atoms and subatomic particles and all these different things fold into each other. And it was so, uh, it was so humbling that I think my ego was trying to battle it. I think my ego was trying to reclaim ground and the way to do that was to make me paranoid, to make me worry about shit. You know, I usually I'm aware when I drive, but I don't usually think like what if a car flips over that lane?

Speaker 1:          01:09:46       What if a car comes in? You know, one of the things that they used to connect a DMT with when it first, uh, when their first experiment with it, they thought it was a causes psychosis and they thought maybe it exists in higher doses and in people that are, um, and people that are psychotic. That's one of the reasons why they're nutty. They're nutty because their brain is producing all this, these weird chemicals that have been shown to be produced by the body that also produce hallucinations. And my B. It's just see that there was a Twitter images about that guy who was pineal. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          01:10:21       Oh yeah, we showed it on the last episode. We did good. Joe, you when your, when your original DMT trips, you talked about how that you met some kind of like visual spirit or something like that and he was tailing like 3000 a million times or whenever that was. Do you still love you talk to that exact same guy or is there a new guy he got fired?

Speaker 1:          01:10:40       It's, there's a part that you go to that's like the same place and the part you go to, it's like these rotating columns that go on in infinity and it's all like you're a part of like this. You see like the gears and the mechanisms of the universe it feels like and it's filled with entities like whatever this thing is, it's filled with like these conscious entities where it feels like conscious entities and sometimes they talk to you in English and some. This last time they were there, were there talking to me and like a language that wasn't even real. Like they were talking to me and like they were like,

Speaker 3:          01:11:14       there were, there were saying were like they were saying like things that didn't make any sense and showing you things and if you thought negative in any way, like you, they would go like, Duh, Duh, Duh Duh Duh Duh Duh Duh, Duh, Duh Dah, Dah, Dah, like finger would shake back and forth and then, then, and then and then, uh, and then if you calm yourself and thought positive, that would calm down. But it was like letting, you know every time you slipped into any sort of a negative pattern of thinking. And it was exposing a lot of the, the ideas that I was thinking that were important, that weren't important at all. So it's all ego based ideas, ideas about, you know, um, how you, how you address or how you look or you know, whether your car is dirty and whether you're not, you know, whether you make x amount a year or y amount of year, whether you, you know, with all these ideas that we have connected to ourselves that like infest our brain and there are there all the time.

Speaker 3:          01:12:06       It was letting me know, like, you're spending too much time thinking about stuff that's not important. It's like showing it to me like over and over and over again, but it didn't do that thing where it says, I love you. It didn't say, look at this. Like the one time it was like, they were like, I love you 600 million, 500,000 times, look at this. And every time they will say, look at this, it would become this even more beautiful thing. Well that's good. It was weird. But this one again, I did to these ICAROS these songs. You're going to do it tomorrow? No. Oh No, no, no. I get it on this Joe. I can't do, but the three teaspoons of cough medicine, they fucking shaky. That's not true, but you could. You could have a drink. You can have a little Xanax. Have a little of that. I don't drink. Was that why? What happens will be your heart slows down too much. Oh, a lot of people die from tranquilizer. Alcohol mix. Yeah. I got to wait for those people.

Speaker 3:          01:13:02       You're pushing for die and we'll see. You can't take a little fucking Valium and a little whiskey. Holy Shit. That's how Merle haggard became famous. I saw Johnny Cash made songs. Got To do it, son makes it up. All those country music guys used to fucking party hard. That was a big shocker to people that saw that Johnny Cash moving a walk the line. Everybody was like, what? They were all pilled up like what the fuck? Yeah. A lot of musicians, musician, when they used to call it a, what'd they call it? Before marijuana was before it was called weed. I forget, but anyway, it's like a grass, maybe grass. Yeah. What's that noise? That outside? Yeah. It's that song coming back. Well, this is a very different podcast show. I never thought I'd get nervous. And your podcast nervous. Well, I started with the, the head stuff gets me a little does it then you should do it. Fuck though. No, we killed me. They, uh, they give you the finger, they look like jokers. They have like joker masks on and you see them when your eyes are open or your eyes and close, your eyes are closed.

Speaker 1:          01:14:12       You see him way more visual. The visuals are way more potent than anything you could ever see with your eyes open. They give you the finger and they're spinning around giving you the finger. But they're having fun with you. They're letting you know, like stop. I think it's their way of telling you not to take yourself seriously. What did it say? Look where we are. Like you, you take yourself seriously, dude. Where we're in another dimension and we're fucking mocking you. You're creating it right. Your brain's created. I don't know. Yeah, I would take, I would think so. You think there's really something out there? What? I don't know and this is the best way to describe it. Um, I don't know what life is. I think life itself, like this life that we live is, if it didn't exist, if you, uh, if you, if you said, if he just, you know, you were creating a universe, you had no, no point of reference and he said we're going to have a bunch of people that the way they interact and let each other know what's on their mind is they make noises with their face and then everybody's noises are different depending on what patch of land you're in.

Speaker 1:          01:15:13       And those, those noises represent like shit that we've written down with symbols. But everybody's symbols are different too. Like there's some similar ones that a lot of people use in different places, but then the Russians, they change them up and the Chinese change, him and the Japanese have their own system and Koreans have their own shit. And then Spanish people use fucking like water slides over the top of their ends. You know, everything's, everything's weird, right? And the only way they communicate with each other is by doing this. And then someone came along and they invented a translator, so you'd take copy, big slabs of pay of of texts. You throw it into Google translate and it spits back up some broken English version of what that person is saying. That's just, that alone is weird. The fact that there's a planet with these types of people, these entities, and they're sending photos of each other, they're, they're fucking, they're flying and metal tubes.

Speaker 1:          01:16:05       They're broadcasting video through the sky and you could pick it up on your phone and you could watch it. I mean, that alone is very psychedelic. It's just, we don't think of it because we keep doing it. We what we do as Comedians is entirely psychedelic. When you're on stage this weekend at the laugh factory and you're killing killed, hello. When you're doing that, you're, that's like a form of mass hypnosis. You got those people locked into the way you're thinking and your doing something to their body by you talking and you talking in his expert rhythm of the master standup comedian and hitting all the punch lines and thank you. Good night. And they're like, whoa, what a show. They laughed and all you did was make noises with your mouth that represent ideas that you can introduce into their head that they wouldn't have ordinarily pieced together. Like my act, I know your work, but that psychedelic. So what is going on when you take a drug and you see these things with your eyes closed? I'm not sure cause it seems like they're way fucking smarter than me. It seems like they're mocking me. They understand me and they're so beyond anything that I could ever experience on this planet. It seems like if,

Speaker 2:          01:17:21       I don't know if there is anything other than this dimension, I don't know. But scientists seem to explain it in some sort of a way where I'm, I'm willing to listen to them, but I don't, there's definitely something else. Whether, I mean just the fact that this is all Adams and it's moving, everything's moving is beyond my scope. I mean, I can't, like if you said something one time, I think we were sitting on stage and about, you know, we have no control over us or a journey through space as a planet. And the thing that's interesting to me is we have absolutely no control. I mean, if this planet just dropped for some gravitational reason, there's nothing we could do. What if it just started falling? That's what I'm saying. Like there's a whole solid system. Everything's spinning and our pants drops. What would we do? I mean, well, yeah, we're going, oh fuck. Getting my salary ship. Somebody puts something in my drink. There's nothing you can do. Yeah, we're fleas. Well, that's not a dog. That's what cracks me up. People who are so full of themselves, but what are you fucking cocky for? Wouldn't even know what we're doing here. That's what they do

Speaker 1:          01:18:29       value. When you do DMT, that's what those things are doing. When they're giving you the finger, they're like, ah, you fucking idiot. You take yourself seriously

Speaker 4:          01:18:35       it wouldn't it be cool if it was always there? Those guys are always around you. And when, only thing that psychedelics does his speed down your timing belt a little. So you can see, I'm kind of like where dogs are always barking at and invisible things and sometimes dogs. What if dog seed that DMT the whole time with you mixed into dogs barking invisible things to hear sound. Yeah, let's do you came here

Speaker 1:          01:18:56       dimethyltryptamine Oh, Rick Strassman will be on the podcast folks. He'll be, uh, on, uh, sometime soon. We're working out the date, but uh, I'll be, uh, I'll be talking to him soon. He'll be flying in. It either be a, most likely it'd be October. Looking forward to it. And Rick Strassman for no one, if anyone knows who he is, he's one of the, anyone doesn't rather, he's one of the first guys to ever get permission from the Dea to do a university studies on dimethyl trip to me and on psychedelic drugs that are schedule one drugs. And he did this, um, series of tests out of the University of New Mexico and wrote a book about it called Dmt, the spirit molecule where they were injecting intravenous DMT into people's bodies where it's the biggest, the longest trip. If you smoke it, it goes directly into your bloodstream, but your body brings it back to baseline and about 10 to 15 minutes depending upon the dose. But if you inject it, it takes a half hour. And apparently these people all had like these intense, intense DMT trips like when I'm talking about, but that went on for 30 minutes. Fuck that. Right. Fuck that again.

Speaker 4:          01:20:04       Sign me up. So you would do at 30 minute one. Yeah,

Speaker 1:          01:20:07       dude, I did five of them the other day. I did one after the other. Yeah. We kept doing it to him. It was amazing. Yeah. You walk out of there, you feel better about life, you feel better about people, you'll feel sorry for like angry, shitty people instead of being mad back at them. You feel sorry for them.

Speaker 4:          01:20:27       And you're not concerned with any side effects?

Speaker 1:          01:20:29       No, none. There's none. I think the side effects that I had when I did it those years ago when I was talking to you about it, I think a lot of those side effects were based on where I was in my head at that time, that it was so obliterating. And then it took me a while to sort of come to grips with what I learned from that experience. But this, this experience, um, which is, uh, at least two years since my last one, this experience was only positive. It wasn't, there was nothing negative about it. It's like I was ready for this experience. Like instead of it like knocking me in the dirt, I had learned enough from my last one that I had, I, I came into it with a good in a good place. Like you're always going to have like a certain amount of ridicule from them.

Speaker 1:          01:21:14       Like you're always getting at, like, it'll put a lot of your ideas and your, uh, like a lot of your, like what do you think is important in a perspective? So I think like that always happens because I think being a person stopping at red lights, talking to people, dealing with customer service on the phone, like develop a, just a certain pattern of behavior that you think is normal for existing in society and that that normalcy you carry around with you like a shield. And when you do DMT they go gimme that they throw it away like you silly like look at all this and they're, they're showing you this insane fractal universe that you exist in. And it's only positive to me, but that's me. I wouldn't advise it, you know? Like I said, I had that one weird trip that fucked me up for a couple of weeks and I'm pretty stable. Insane in comparison to a lot of people that I know. So if you're not stable or not saying or you're having real problems, I wouldn't recommend you doing it right here. That's me. That's you. I would recommend you doing it though.

Speaker 4:          01:22:17       Yeah, I mean, I'm very, I've had a few bad trips we've talked about in the past and I've still done it even though knowing those bad trips. But there was also like a recent time where I did mushrooms where I remember going, you know what? I think I'm done with this. Just I'm not going to learn anything more from this. This is now. It's just kind of like me fucking with my brain that hopefully everything works out okay. You know, definitely learned a lot by herself. I'll still, I'm not writing it off, but it, there was, that's what I felt. My last trip though when I was in my trip, it just getting stuck in there. Eddie Bravo

Speaker 1:          01:22:52       two artists. Um, I forgot the gentleman's name, but uh, he's a really good tattoo. Two hours to go do the Biomek stuff on his arm. He did DMT like a hundred.

Speaker 4:          01:23:00       He's in a row and somewhere you, somewhere during

Speaker 1:          01:23:05       the trip, the DMT entities like, hey, hey, hey, no more. Stop enough. Like they were telling him, you gotta stop doing this. Wow. But he was, he was creating all this artwork and all this. He's having all these visions and he wanted to be in the DMT realm more than he wanted to be in the regular world. So he's like pulling back from the regular world. He was like, he didn't want to interact with people. He just couldn't wait to get back to his house to get blasted again. So he'd go into hyperspace.

Speaker 4:          01:23:33       When you finally get into just the DMT, Rome, you just become homeless. Right. That's what those guys are probably on the streets. They've done so much drugs. Most of them mixed with, you know, you know, schizophrenia and their backgrounds maybe, but it, those are just people that have fucked their brains up. Right.

Speaker 1:          01:23:48       I don't know. I mean, I think a lot of people are just mentally ill. I don't think they've done it necessarily to themselves with drugs. I think there's, that would be unfair to assume. I think a lot of those guys are just people. Look, some people get cancer, some people have, you know, serious diseases. I have hypothyroidism. Some people have, uh, no. Yeah, yeah, I have that. It's hereditary. My mother has it. Um, I take a thyroid medication. What does, so it, it fixes it, but, which really fixes it fun. It doesn't, it doesn't affect me at all, but, uh, it would make me real tired towards the end of the day. Right when I was on fear factor, I started getting concerned because I was getting these weird headaches. They were weird. Like at the end of the day I'd be, I would be so exhausted and I was getting these headaches where it was like my head was just compressed and it felt like the only solution was to sleep. Like I would fall asleep, like watching TV and I was like, this is not normal. It does not. No, no. I know what a normal tired feels like. This is not feel like a normal tired and uh, I have, they call it Hashimoto's disease and it's, um, to some weird hereditary failure of your, your thyroid gland. That's part of the endocrine system. Yeah. Yeah. It's just comes from, you know, I mean, what, they don't know what it comes from, but a lot of people get it. My ex girlfriend had, I remember he helped her

Speaker 4:          01:25:04       because she was having really bad ups and downs and she tried all these different ones. Then you turned around to this one.

Speaker 1:          01:25:09       Yeah. Armour thyroid. Armour thyroid is made from pigs thyroids and it's very biocompatible to human beings and it makes it essentially like you don't have an issue. But I had the other stuff, the different thyroid medications weren't the so good until I got this stuff. Yeah. Yeah. There's a lot of people that have it, man. Super Common. Sometimes it's a, I would never have guessed that because you have so much fucking energy. That was what was weird to them. They didn't understand why I was so lean when, when they brought me in, they tested me. They were like, you know, like how come, uh, has this affected your weight? Have you gotten fat? And I'm was like, not at all. No, because I was, I would push through it, you know, even though I would be tired and forced myself to work out. And when you're doing Jujitsu, um, it's so intense that you, you, you, you're fighting for your life essentially. When you're on the mat and so there's, there's no way you can half ass a workout. So I stayed lien even though I had this issue, but it was definitely affecting my endurance. Like I noticed a difference since I started

Speaker 3:          01:26:04       taking it and now you're back to normal. Totally normal. Yeah. But um, you know, people have weird things. I mean you were talking about kidney stones. Some people have, you know, some people have kidney diseases, some people have failure of their, their fucking, the what rich Vos and Bonnie Mcfarlane have his next door neighbor. They were talking about it on the, uh, the radio show today, who's losing his liver. His liver is dying. He drank too much and he killed his liver and there was waiting for a fucking transplant. Shit goes wrong, man. The body, the body doesn't always work forever. Nobody gets out alive. Delude. It's do, do, do, do, do, do I have a drink? And Again, oh Jesus, Dom, now you, now you tell us you want to drink right now. No. Okay, good. It's a test. That means you could put it away.

Speaker 3:          01:26:47       He didn't get all shaky in the head. Oh, wake up fucking drunk every day. Every day. Every day. Wow. Just to give yourself a day off and I was thinking about that. Maybe tonight we'll play some pool after this. Give yourself a break. You don't want to play pool drunk. He'd be upset with yourself. Do you enjoy drinking water? It is water hard for you to drink. I love you. A drink of water. I hate water. Do you enjoy drinking water? I mean, I like Tang heat water and why just doesn't do it for me. I, I'd rather drink Gatorade, but I bought her. Terrible for you. Let me, it's not bad for you after you work out because you need to replenish the shutters, the lecturer to in sugars too. Right? Like one of the best things after you workout is actually chocolate milk. Really? Yeah. Chocolate milk is great, especially after you lift weights because it has a little bit of protein in it. Um, it has a milk, milk proteins. Uh, it also has a caisson, I think it's called, and a sugar because of the chocolate syrup and all that jazz. It actually replenishes your glycogen. It's really, it's like the best. That's me. And chocolate milk.

Speaker 3:          01:27:56       Sexy as fuck. Where's this show me? That was all long time ago, man. That's a early two thousands, somewhere around there. I, we've known each other a long time brother. Yeah, man. We'd known each other since the 90s. My brother Dominique, we played pool at Amsterdam billiards and like 1993 or so. You had just gotten that show I think. I don't even think I had it yet. They didn't have it yet, so I think I'd just done your show. I did that, that showtime thing with you in Montreal and then we ran into each other. So it Amsterdam. Yeah, that was great. The one on the upper west side was great. The new one's great too. It's on the east side. I haven't seen it. Where is it? Uh, uh, I don't remember the s to see the streets, but it's like lower numbers on the east side.

Speaker 3:          01:28:40       It's great. It's like New York has a bunch of pool halls, but la, they're all gone, man. They're all gone. All the pools when Hollywood billiards, we went, it was fun too. The other one, we could take the girls up. Oh yeah. Hollywood athletic club. Yeah, that was great. That was back in the 90s. Thumb a neck bourbon. Still a good one. Yeah. They still have, what does it fantasia or something like that. Yeah. That's a good one. This is a nice table you got here. Yeah, that's a good table. That's a, that's an old gold crown too. That's from the 1970s. I'm excited to write a range. Pockets. My friend. Very small. No, really? Oh they gonna hurt your soul going to bring, uh, yeah. This guy or Nesto Domingez top pool player. He uh, he's also a great table mechanic and his brother has a son rather Oscar Domingez a top pro. And uh, they, uh, they make these, uh, these, they cut these table. I made this, will they, uh, they, they built the table. So they make these table openings like four inch holes. So it's very, very difficult. It's a normal one. Five it's a big difference.

Speaker 3:          01:29:46       My back's going to be killing me from rack and that's how I would do if there was a, if, if I couldn't, if I couldn't do standup anymore, I would try playing pool professionally. I tried going on the tour if there was a tour tours kind of dead. Now it's amazing because it's such a great, great sport. P needs a television show, pull needs like Larry the cable guy and to travel the country. You're right. They did. It needs, it needs something. I thought about doing it for awhile. I thought about doing a show where I go from town to town and play the best guy in the house or something like that, but people would get bored. I told you this before, you got too much going in your life to become a pro. Who took put in the practice it would take to be a pro.

Speaker 3:          01:30:26       I know, but I get obsessed, get obsessed with things, done my room. You get obsessed with anything. If you get the old fucking moves back, you wouldn't try it. A little bit of pro ball, a little dribbling between the lanes. People don't know you're a good basketball player. Uh, that was like a chewed. You could beat somebody at horse. You think, fuck people up at horse. I had these two kids. I was in Ohio and I guess they heard I could play basketball. They said, well, you're a good basketball player. I said, well, for a comedian, they go, uh, could you jump? I go, I could grab the rim. My height. That's a good jumping. Where are fast? It goes really fast. They go, you, you go. Not what you're seeing now. You fucking idiot. I have this fucking bloated old Chinese man. Fuck I am.

Speaker 3:          01:31:12       No, no. Like fucking 145 pounds a monkey muscle. When you see, when you see your face go, Chinese did, do you have the urge to just walk around, do whatever, the urge to fight it? I don't know what happened. Is that as that, is that a disease? I didn't look at me. I don't know what the fuck happened to my head. I think it's a lot of it is a water retention. Alcohol probably. Yeah. Your body fat rises. Your whole face gets Chinese, like very moved by. It should be honest with me. At my worst, if I lost too much weight, do I look beautiful? I love you. No matter what you look like. Um, this, uh, it wish you were a hot chick. This drinking thing. Um, is this something you want to do something about it or you just kinda gotta I gotta you gotta look for,

Speaker 2:          01:31:59       you've done it like cold Turkey, right? Yeah. My doctor said, just take a half a Xanax and you can, I said, well, I go get, you know, I get convulsions and shit if I stopped drinking cold Turkey. He says, no, me. I guess because my body was drew from it all day today. You know what I mean? That's not like I'm drinking. I get up and have a drink and then you, we asked me if I want to drink. Oh yeah, go for one. It's not like that. It's just you convenient. Like it's a pattern that you fall into when you go out at night. I love being high and like, uh, I'll sit there at night and I'll go around. I'm going to have like two shots and I go, all right. Six shots. Six shots. Yeah. I just keep every night. What's your main drink?

Speaker 2:          01:32:38       Your main, your gut, which I can reach. Uh, I like, I'm Jay Jamison. I looked up dirty martinis. Oh, so you'd just drink straight with no mixers or, yeah, maybe start doing large drinks and then it's like, you know, like I do Ginger Ale. No, he wants her get drunk. See, I want to get drunk. I don't want to get to know. Trying to like sit there sipping. I don't want to enjoy it. Like, Hey, hey, Jackie is open up your Aa. I put this umbrella and you drink. It makes it more difficult to find in the liquid. It's all not all happy. Got to move it around and makes you drink slow. Ah, I fucking hate like Pina coladas and shit like that. Do you like getting caught in the rain? I feel like the smell of the ocean, of the tastes of champagne. I like Jimmy Buffet and making love at midnight. I don't think that was Jimmy Buffet. If you like Pina coladas. Who was that thought it was difficult, but no, I don't believe so. Look it up, motherfucker.

Speaker 2:          01:33:39       Shaking the day. The chicken that they, I feel like it's something. Someone else. Yup. Jimmy Buffett. Is it man? Don't you bring your primitive? That feels to me about music minster rogue. No, it's Rupert Holmes. Hey fucking knucklehead. It says Jimmy Buffet. Rupert Holmes recorded by American singer Rupert Holmes. I think it was made famous by Jimmy Buffett. It's on the midnight special. Burt Sugarman. Here we go. This is Rupert Holmes. You're both right. This is the famous one. Yeah, that's it. It's Rupert Holmes, so don't trust Brian red band to Google anything for you that your life on it. I played Jimmy Buffett's science. Probably going to sound exactly the same, but that's probably the one that played the Jimmy Buffet. I want to hear it. Jimmy Buffet. Well, this guys, this is the guy who made that. He had the hit. The guy who had the hit that was on the radio is Rupert Holmes. Okay. You're right. I think I'm definitely right. I know how to Google you Google with your dick or something. I don't even think you pay attention to what you write in there. I honestly thought that that that was a Jimmy Buffett. Jimmy Buffett is the fucking Margaritaville guy and

Speaker 3:          01:34:57       maybe that's why he's not a Pina Colada. How did we go over to look at about the universe? Brian Redman, fucking, he's the crowbar in any intellectual discussion. Clang. Your gears get ground up and then the, the fucking elves give you the finger. Look at things like this, like if you like peanut clot, Jimmy Buffet, I think that's an idiot that doesn't know that it's not Jimmy Buffet. That's just some more on youtube. Unless Jimmy Buffett actually sang a version of it. See if we can find a Jimmy Buffet version of it, but Jimmy Buffett was wasted,

Speaker 8:          01:35:29       man. Oh No.

Speaker 3:          01:35:32       He has a whole fucking station on Xm. You can listen to Jimmy Buffet. All of this. I don't think go with the, if you're in Florida, you would, if you were in Florida and you're popping Xanax and drinking booze and just fucking sitting on the feature, you still right? No, never. No. But you'd take a Xanax in the morning and by the time it wears off, then you're drinking. That's how it works. Is there a, is there a version of it where there's one that when I was showing, you know, you're right, it's mostly all just repaired homes and Jamie just shoved me something like the five songs that people think are from the wrong artists. Oh, okay. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Because it seems like it would be kind of a Jimmy Buffet Song, but I knew it wasn't him and it's because of Margaritaville. I think you totally nailed it right there.

Speaker 3:          01:36:14       I think that's why I'm just immediately thought it's one of those old ass songs that you don't understand. Like, um, like uh, the things you do for love. Who the fuck saying that? Like what the fuck we're looking for the answer. And I, I had a copy of that when I was a little kid. I was a little kid, like maybe six or seven and we had a 45 of that song and things you do for love was like, the first song I ever owned was like, who the fuck knows? See if Brian, I'll pull it up. Call me. Hendrix, led Zeppelin, the WHO? It's a British band called 10 CC, 10 16 wow. Really? You know, a friend of mine was on a cruise ship and Robert Plant was on it and somebody called, somebody called him led. Oh, my daughter's name was lit. What a disaster. Why would Robert Plank go on a fucking, why would he ever do that? Do you know? Wrapped on a boat? Oh, I fucking know what to do. I've been on fishing boats. I don't like both set.

Speaker 3:          01:37:29       If I lived near a lake, I would be in heaven. If I lived in a lake and I could just pull out like a nice bass boat out there and go fishing. I love fishing. So fun. So primal to some about catching your dinner. You know, he's throw that soccer on ice, filet it, get home, cook it, eat it. Very satisfying. Something like caveman style satisfying. It just feels great. Have a couple of beers when you're out there. Castle wine, enjoy the day. Just go to the seafood restaurant. Oh, dom, you say that? Do you ever catch a big fish? It's fucking fine. Look at me. Do I look like a fish? I got to put up some youtube videos and me and Ari, when we were, uh, in um, uh, Alaska last summer we had a great time. That was really manic. We uh, well that was that part too, but we caught the salmon run like right when the King Salmon Salmon, we're running strong.

Speaker 3:          01:38:21       Oh. And we caught like seven, eight fish a day and they were giant like big 30, 40 pounds salmon. It was so fun. I got some videos. I need to put them up on Youtube. I've had him for a while, but we had a fucking blast because we had a gig up there. We set scheduled a Gig for one day, but we went fishing for two days before the Gig. It was so much fun. That's cool. Did you see the video that grouper eating a shark? Yes. Put that shit up. It's probably going to get us right. This is the part of the show where we say this will get us pulled from youtube. If you, if you're tired of chicken getting pulled from Youtube, folks go to Vimeo. Vimeo doesn't pull things like youtube does for whatever reason. But uh, this grouper is groupers. If you don't know, they get to be like hundreds of pounds there. Fucking huge. So this guy is caught. The Shark and the grouper just gangs his fucking shark. He's pulling the shark in and it's so enormous. I mean there are like four or 500 pounds sometimes these Goliath groupers and it comes up and it, it's snatches his fucking shark. Like he's got the shark floating around at the top and the fish can't help himself. He's like, fuck it. Here he goes,

Speaker 3:          01:39:38       look at this thing. Look at the size of this fucking thing. One bite. One bite inhales the entire shark. Fucking unreal. That's how big Goliath grouper is. If you catch one of those bitches, you're going to be pulling that thing for hours. You're going to be hang on,

Speaker 7:          01:39:57       Aye.

Speaker 3:          01:39:59       I don't even like go into a seafood restaurant and they tell you to cook your own fish. Do they do that? And boy I have seen it tell you. Gotta clean my plate too, Dan. Thanks. You like you go on a date. It's like with doing activities, we're cooking together. Turn it over for me. I like tipping fun. Do I take the brand? I tip in the cheese. Ooh, that's good too Joe. People like the Korean barbecue. We like you have the, the the hot thing in front of you and you slap down. There's a place in the mall out here. They do that. I love that. It's annoying. I don't like it at all. No, it's stupid. Any things? He smells so bad when you leave. If I was going to cook myself, I wouldn't cook like that. I like cooking over like charcoal, like like lump charcoal. Can you get that smoky flavor? It's more about all you can eat. The, Oh, was it all you can eat places? Not all you can eat you, you choose which meat

Speaker 4:          01:40:54       group you want. Like you get there be like an $18 per person, 24, $30 in of the 31. You get a different menu. You could just order as much as you want or you can eat things. Psychologically it seems a lower the quality really. All you can eat Sushi. Oh yeah. But Brazilian

Speaker 1:          01:41:10       steakhouses. Oh, that's fantastic. Those two. Haas Korea's, we have that card. Yeah. Like green on one side of red on the other. When it's red. Do you want to take a break when it's green? They just common with new food. Yeah. They both places like that in Philly. After Eddie Bravo, uh, fought and metamorris or has grappling match and Metamorris we went to a Fogo de Chao and uh, near the Beverly Center. Brian and I have eaten it about

Speaker 4:          01:41:36       most of them. Most of them across the country. There's anyone in San Diego. Yeah, I know. I noticed. I noticed when I was down in American comedy company, when we would show up

Speaker 1:          01:41:45       town and we found a Fogo, we'd go, ah, we get alongside and we go there. That's delicious. And Joey Diaz would look at you like you're an asshole. If you go anywhere near that salad bar, why you fucking want that salad bar dog? Listen, sit down here. He had no danger. You're in no danger. Bring it over. Bring it all. We've got, what do we got when we got, he started talking in Spanish to the fucking guy. The skewers, they speak Portuguese. He's talking to them in Spanish trying to find some middle ground.

Speaker 4:          01:42:09       I recently went and they, they hide that Kanye now they, that guy's hard to find. You ask it to different people and you get so much chicken sausage and bacon stuff and you're like, just give me the Pecan. I think it's a matter of how many people are there. Like some things like are more popular, right?

Speaker 1:          01:42:24       Uh, last time we were there, they kept coming with it. They had the big Kanya and the garlic beef or be is like top sirloin. What they do is they have like a, an open fire. It's like a wood fire. It's like real and they have these skewers that they lean over the fire and the skewer spin around and when when they deem that it's ready, then they bring it over your table, slice pieces off the outside and then they put it right back on the five salted. Yeah, the result it and put like I have a basting thing if they do and so this is a big piece of meat and they put it over this fire and they just slowly cooked the outside and then they put it back in and slowly cooked the outside and I'm getting hungry. There's a place near here you want to eat after this?

Speaker 4:          01:43:00       Yeah. Fuck yeah. By the way, Joe, our green mountain grill, they have a new app now that you could use the app to tell when your food's done.

Speaker 1:          01:43:08       They sent me the info. I got to hook it up though. You got to get a guy to come to your house though and plug it in sensor thing and yeah, it's not easy to do, but that green mountain grills ma. Awesome. Yeah. That's a pellet grill. If you don't know what that is, it's a smoker. It's smokes your, your food like, like an oven. That's the hot smoke of uh, this burning firewood or this burning a hardwood. They take hardwood. And when you like, say if you bought a table like this table's made out of Oak, well someone who cut this would you leave a lot of saw dust and they buy the hardwood saw dust and they compress it into these pellets, which with the natural sugars of the wood, there's no additives. It's just the wood itself. And then you pour these pellets. It looks like, almost like you ever seen that pine kitty litter to use that stuff. The best stuff

Speaker 3:          01:43:52       cuts the smell back the most. Yeah. But you take these pellets and you pour it into this like hopper. It's like this box close the lid on it and he set the temperature and it automatically keeps the fire going. It's like this got this, um, what is it called? An element that that heats it up and it spins it and like this gear and the pellets automatically get introduced and the fire has the exact right amount of temperature and you can keep it at like, you know, like for two 50 or three 50 or trying to cook something. Whoa. So amazing. It's so easy. Like I used to have another kind of smoker used to have to add, would do it all the time. It was a nightmare. This thing does it all itself and it tastes like all those guys. Like have you ever watched those barbecue competitions?

Speaker 3:          01:44:33       You ever watch those things and like the food channel, a lot of those guys, they use those pellet grills now. The pellet grills are like a big, a big deal. Hey, you put the meat on, you know, earlier in the afternoon and it's just falling off the bone. No, it's pretty bad ass. It's pretty bad ass. I'm a big fan. I've got a big, big fan. Tom, I ran right back at you. Joe's big fan. I love cooking men. Cooking is fun. It's especially fun when you're cooking something that you killed yourself. When you cut it up yourself and you slap that bitch on the grill. It's very exciting though. Never killed anything. What'd you be willing? I'm thinking about doing a hunting show. This is the idea of the hunting show. The idea of the hunting show is I go out with people that have never been hunting before, whether it's comedians like Hannibal Burress, he said he would go, um, a lot of guys are interested in going, I would go to the flash star hotel closest to where goes, it goes go home and he wouldn't hunt.

Speaker 3:          01:45:25       No. What if we took you out in a pickup truck and you can just roll down the window and fire it out the window? Yes, definitely. What'd you do that? That's my style. You can do that in some places in Texas, there's a ranch that Aubrey hunted at where you literally shoot your rifle from the front seat of the truck. Oh, I love the, the fucking truck has no windshield. So you drive around on this truck. You know, I don't know if it's like a jeep or if it's actual pickup truck. They knocked the windshield out, but you drive around in this truck and then they get close to these herds of animals and then a fucking set your rifle up right there through the window. Boom. He shoot it. Then you get out of the truck, you get it, you take a photo with it. Oh, I got to get out of the truck. You don't have to. Okay, I'll bring it to you. I'm still in. I'll bring it to you and you can wave. Instead of taking a picture with the animal you kill, you just wave from the window. This is dumb. This is dom to deer and you uh, and then they take care of everything else. It's like the laziest way to hunt ever. I would like that.

Speaker 3:          01:46:25       What I was, we were in the mid Sophie, we're in Hawaii and she was snorkeling and I finished. She's only, you are so fucking lazy. Could find a way to snorkel without even going under water. I got one of those riffs that you see through, put my head on the snorkeled with a raft. Oh, that's hilarious. I snorkeled for the first time. Last time I was in Hawaii. It was awesome. It's really fun. Yeah. Swimming around a reef. We're around a reef. You're seeing all these fish moving around in their little world. You know, it was a little, uh, I stepped on a CNN enemy though. This fucker went right into my foot. Really? Yeah. They had a poor vinegar all over my foot. You're supposed to do it. If you've got to go near a reef, like reefs are really sure. He's supposed to do it with those a scuba shoes because that was his barefoot. But you, uh, you step down in the wrong spot and he see an enemy like black spines went deep into my foot. Oh yeah. Fuck me up.

Speaker 4:          01:47:19       I never go in the ocean without shoes on. I just don't want to step on anything gross. Like what? Condoms dead. I stepped on dead. Jellyfish wants I'm, it's just disgusting. And just, you know, there's a lot of great stuff

Speaker 3:          01:47:30       she can fuck you up. Especially Australia. Oh yeah. If you were to, uh, Australia, there's um, certain species of jellyfish that kill people every year.

Speaker 2:          01:47:39       Yeah. I was just there a couple months ago in Perth. They have the helicopters going over, you know, to spot the sharks. They have that in Adelaide to really, yeah. Cause they have, well they see them, they warn people. Fuck that big white, great white sharks. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          01:47:58       Yeah. That's a, that's a scary spot. Apparently the most scary spot for sharks in South Africa. Australia is pretty bad. Is it van? Yeah. That's also a place where a lot of people surf too, right? Yeah. Did you ever surf? Yeah. Really observed you surf, but you, what was it like?

Speaker 2:          01:48:17       I was a pretty good athlete then. I was, I got up a couple times, you know, I did it a few times. It's the thing about it, you have to be a strong swimmer to really get out there, to have them enjoy it. Can't just like go 20 feet and expect to ride something in.

Speaker 3:          01:48:30       You got it. Right. And you've got to climb on it at just the right time to write. Yeah, it's probably difficult. It's, yeah, it's very difficult. A place in Abu Dhabi, I think it's Abu Dhabi or Dubai. I've seen that they created an indoor surfing. That's pretty wild. It's ridiculous. So we're most ridiculous thing ever. Like isn't the whole idea is that you're out there in the ocean with nature and these guys will learn in the middle of the does it, we're in a pool, in a mall. Sometimes. You've got to settle.

Speaker 4:          01:48:59       Brennan did comedy there back in, was it Neil that you used to say? He did.

Speaker 3:          01:49:05       He tries. I'm kidding. No, he does. Eddie have just had a Kickstarter. He created his own. Um, he created his own like mobile podcast van, like a van to go drive around and do podcasts. We talked about doing that on the podcast, like getting a stream one of those streamers, whether it's called streamline streamline's those silver ones. Yeah, they'll silver things. Is that called streamline? Yeah. Why? I feel like it's called something else. Streamline trailer. It's the silver one. Yeah. Well that thing, the cool looking retro looking one Gulf Stream. Jimmy Buffet had one stream.

Speaker 4:          01:49:41       I was actually thinking about recently. You just sell it because I have my second card and selling it and try to and get one of those and we've death squad into that.

Speaker 3:          01:49:48       It's not a bad idea dude. I thought about doing it too and like that we could do them like on the road. You could do it like you show up an hour early for a Gig, do a Gig, you know, doing the parking lot. But the fun, the friendship flashed on the dust squad. There was no one knows. No one initiation fees is two on your backstage. Lower back. The lower back two dolphins game. Why were you like to come? But there, yeah, this one, this is, there's a company that makes like a high end version of these things where the inside of it is like air stream. There it is. I know you fucked it up. Streamline. What'd I say? Streamline. Yup. But there is a streamline, see this is a streamline trailer. Uh, so there's some, some of them are streamlined. They just ripped off the air stream game.

Speaker 3:          01:50:34       Yeah, look at that. It makes it look that sexy thing. How much are these fucking expensive? They're not cheap because they're really made well be says there's a place up in big Sur where you will you rent them? They have a, they have them set up on this property and that's how he camp. They have like a like a little grill out there. Like Dunkin was up there for like a week. He loved it. He said big surfaces. Favorite place on the planet. It's beautiful. I know there's one in Joshua tree where a lot of la comics all they rent out a trailer. They have, I went to [inaudible] where they had this big circle of trailers in each one's decorated like a different, like the 70s you know the retro on the Star Trek one you have any interest in doing like going to burning man? No. Next year we should podcasts from burning man.

Speaker 3:          01:51:22       If we're in a trailer, yes, but if we, oh yeah dude, we're going to be a trail. That's what I mean. I will go there if there's a trailer, but it's burning man. It's a ridiculous festival out in the middle of the desert where everyone gets together and they all like dance around and do drugs. They don't shower. It's an excuse to be stinky. It's like it's a like a psychedelic sort of a festival. And these people, they all get together. Look at this one Brian. They have one that's like a truck. They have a, they have like a coach and you could drive it around. They call them interstate Ext. So look at this. Oh Wow. Yeah. So you could drive it. So you'd have like your, your kitty cat on the side of it. It gets someone to paint it or get one of those uh, uh, wrap.

Speaker 3:          01:52:05       Yeah. And you take one of these things around if you develop, like if you really developed a plan and like set forth like a, uh, like a, a real like legitimate plan to get one of these things. You could do it in a couple of years. Here's, will Smith at burning man this year on segways. Will Smith, was there no for real or is it a Smith Mask? Which ones will Smith just wonder here. Other dancing together. What are they doing? Filming something. They're getting jiggy with it. They're getting genuine. Um, desk Mckenna. He are not a dentist. We can have Graham Hancock rather. He goes there every year. I think you just got back it, it just happened, right? Yeah, it was last week and actually the first day or two was canceled because of rain. The, they have the crane and it closed, flooded. All the roads going into it. They even have like these really small ones.

Speaker 3:          01:52:54       Look, they just attach to the back of your trailer and then you can just leave it at home if he went to, yeah, there's some good ones. Um, w rain. Where is it? Uh, uh, Arizona. Where does Bernie man type place? I think it's one of the thing. It was California. And what did I think it was California done many death valley, California and the land to go to burning man thumb. No desire at all. Jews. We're doing a podcast down there next year. Would you be willing to stay for one day? We'll lemme you when you come out. You do the pockets with you out. You're in Arizona. That's great. Heard it here first in to the broadcast. We drink, we eat well. We've been talking about taking this bitch mobile, doing some uh, podcasts in New York, doing some podcasts and other places where I can't, you know, I get, can't get certain guests to come here, so I want to go to them.

Speaker 3:          01:53:45       I like it here. Do you like it? Here is a good spot. Yeah. Very good. But you, you're, you, you know, still with the Werewolf starting out. They're trapped by the pool table. I gotta fuck toy miss up. You're not paying attention. She is black. Rock desert is worked. Burning man is, where's that? Arizona. Nevada. Hmm. Didn't they try to enforce laws there this year? The same like the catch people with drugs are gonna arrest him and some shit. Check your car for weapons. All that. Leave people alone. Fucking drugs. She's, hey, he's got a, they got to make money somehow by my era. That's exactly what it is. I keep all those people in uniform. Who gives a fuck? What do people even care? Old People, conservatives, people who want tax dollar business, that's not their business. That's the point. That's what makes young people so angry.

Speaker 3:          01:54:30       It's almost like they know that they're, they're controlled. They have is fleeting and they know that there's kind of a new age in the air like what was going on in the 60s is going on now, but to a much larger extent and to a much more broad extent, like the, the understanding of how corrupt our system is. The understanding of like how flaw did all is piece together. Even by the people that are in it. They're involved in it. It's like they're all admitting the whole thing is a disaster. Well, there's the financial system, the political system, and then on top of that, like marijuana is becoming legal. Whether people like it or not. It's spreading. Colorado was making so much fucking tax money. It's incredible. It's also happening in Washington state. Unprecedented number two, Superbowl teams. We're both from states that it was legal cars highest fuck come up with good ideas.

Speaker 3:          01:55:17       Excellent strategies. I, Joe, I don't even, you know, I smoked pot four times in my life and I always go for number five. No, it's one hit. Just a little bit of one hit the switch to all these stores that will be a heroin addict and a week and make you feel good. It's not a gateway drug. Just the Partnership for drug free America trying to trick you. I'm totally convinced that it's not a gateway drug, by the way. I'm totally good. I know. I don't know anybody from that went from pot to heroin. Well, you could, but you could also go from toothpaste to heroin. You know, it doesn't mean that it's a gateway. Like everybody drinks water. Who does heroin, by the way, Karen would, should be legal, by the way. I do too. I think everything should be legal, but I think there should be consequences to selling people things that are bad for them.

Speaker 3:          01:55:57       So I think that if you, if heroin is legal, but if you're selling heroin, I think that should be massive consequences. I think you should be. If people die of overdoses, I think you should be held responsible. Just like you should be held responsible. Say if you come up with, uh, you come up with some new medication, you know, he caught up with, if you're a pharmaceutical company and you come up with a new medication and deals with Migraines, but it also winds up killing a certain percentage of people. They should be held financially responsible. You should be able to be sued. He's got a joint for you. He's the devil. Look at him. That's what the devil looks like. Everybody thinks the devil looks mean. Likes cuddly devil. Looks like a big sweetie. No, no, no, no, no, no, no. He doesn't stop being a pusher.

Speaker 3:          01:56:36       What were we talking about before the devil? Just the legality of drugs and how ridiculous. Uh, and you were saying that people who sell, excuse me, this is the point, sells drugs to people she'll be held. That's why it's being responsible for the repercussions of what happens to people when they use it. If people die of heroin overdoses, if that's possible from something that you sell, you should be held financially responsible up to a point because you know, you could die from Shell, from salt, you could die like get me a, if you'd give a Guy Bacon every day for breakfast, it's going to be dangerous if you eat nuts, not banded bank. And believe it or not is not bad for you. Bacon. Yep. Not Bad for you. It's delicious thing I've ever had in my life. It's not bad for you. You know what's bad for you being fat enough that bacon is bad for you.

Speaker 3:          01:57:20       That's what's valued to say it like that. I'm not saying any foul. You said it with like a, you like go, you projected it to you because you like the audience of my delivery. But I mean you, I'm at Ralphie may I met someone larger. That's not me. I love Ralphie by the way. This is just jokes. They're talking about me. I right here. Yeah, he's right there. Um, but when you're, when you're so fat that Bacon's doing un well, some people have naturally high cholesterol too. That's another thing to take into consideration. There's some people that are genetically have high cholesterol and they have to watch it. Yeah. And they have, you also have to balance out your good cholesterol and your bad cholesterol. A lot of people think the cholesterol is all bad. You know there's Ldl and Hdl, there's, there's good cholesterol and then this cholesterol that is, it's not not good for you but is good. But if you have like low cholesterol like pho, there's certain cholesterol that's actually good for brain function. Yeah, I think I've just heard that though. Uh, cholesterol, the hipster coalesced good. I'm going to write cholesterol. Good. Okay. Good versus bad cholesterol from the American heart association. Okay, so this is not bullshit at all. HDL and LDL triglycerides. What's the difference in Ldl? Cholesterol is considered the bad cholesterol because it contributes to plaque, which is a thick, hard deposit that can clog arteries and make

Speaker 1:          01:58:42       them less flexible. So are still our, our, our theory or old sclerosis. Arterial Sclerosis is what comes from the bad cholesterol and those narrowed arteries or give people heart attacks. HDL cholesterol is considered good cholesterol because it helps remove LDL cholesterol from the arteries, which is interesting. So expert Cresta does that, is that that a a pill? Yeah, and Lipitor too, right? It's that same same kind of stuff. Experts believe that HDL acts as a scavenger carrying LDL cholesterol away from the arteries and back to the liver where it is broken down and passed from the body. One fourth to one third of blood cholesterol is carried by HDL. A healthy level of HDL cholesterol may also protect against heart attack and stroke while low levels of HDL cholesterol have been shown to increase the reduced risk of heart attacks. Um, Dr. Mark Gordon explained this to me when I had my, um, my blood work done.

Speaker 1:          01:59:39       And when he was telling me is that there's a lot of issues like where people think they have high cholesterol and then, you know, they say, oh my cholesterol count is this. And he'd say, okay, what does that mean? Is it your HDL or Ldl? And then most people don't even know, like they used to not know. And if you're dealing with a physician that doesn't understand the difference between the two, if they're not an expert in it, like thinking, give you bad advice and get you on medication that you don't even need. Like you just said, you have high HDL, you have high, uh, you have high healthy cholesterol, you can, you know, you really want to balance allegedly coming from me. I'm a little doctor to steal one of your bits. I'm not a doctor that I had no idea. But um, so my point is big and not bad. Not Bad for you.

Speaker 4:          02:00:28       Did he went to burning man this year and changed as supposedly changed his life forever. Like look at his picture of him at burning man and then like, look at this.

Speaker 1:          02:00:39       He was at burning man with his own little umbrella. You didn't even have a guy holding it for him. That's crazy.

Speaker 4:          02:00:44       ADDS up pink. Who's that? PDT. Oh, and supposedly it changed his life once. CanNot explain. I'll never be the same. Same

Speaker 1:          02:00:56       Bacon is loaded with fats, but they're good fats. The fats and bacon or about 50% monounsaturated. And a large part of those is a lyric acid. This is the same fatty acid that olive oil is praise for it and is generally considered heart-healthy. 40% of it is saturated fat, accompanied by a decent amount of cholesterol. But we now know that the saturated fat isn't harmful and cholesterol in the diet doesn't affect cholesterol and the blood. Fascinating. But that's the greatest thing was I had all day to Bacon, Bacon and jogging. Go get some Bacon said when two of them together. Do you, so you, you, you're going to the gym though, right? You work out? Yeah. Where do you work out? No, don't tell people they'll fuck it. Stock you. They'll stock in a steal your underwear, breaking your locker and shit in it.

Speaker 2:          02:01:40       You know the this place shirt. Correct. Oh, that place. Okay. Yeah. So you get a good workout there. Yeah, I've got an, excuse me. I got a torn rotator cuff, partially torn. So it's been tough to lift the weights and then you get flabby right away at this age. It's funny, I was in Perth and I opened, the elevator was closed during a fire alarm about but pulled this thing. Whoa. Unbelievable timing. I'm in Chicago, fucking totally in pain. The guy comes up to me after he goes, you know, I'm an orthopedic surgeon. Uh, I got 20 doctors here. A couple of us were talking about you, you have a partially torn rotator cuff. I said, uh, why you can tell by looking at me. He goes, absolutely. He said he could. He could see the way he was raised in my hand. He says, come in tomorrow, Pro Bono, I'll take care of you.

Speaker 2:          02:02:27       Wow. I says, you know, I got insurance. It's not, no, you made me laugh for 25 years. I'll take care of it. So I think it's going to be me, him and a needle. It's like a whole group of doctors and you know, he's trying to be funny. He goes, is that the hand you come with? Oh, he said, is that the hand you jerk off? And I said, well, I jerk with that hand, but I offered the sand and uh, anyway, so I'm up there and he gives me a needle in the shoulder. I said, well, why am I paying my hip hurts too because I look at that, the x Ray that give me another fucking shot. It was great.

Speaker 3:          02:02:57       So the parsley turned rotator cuff, does it need surgery? No, no, it's 85%. I mean it's only 15% tour so it just needs exercise. So you have to stabilize it. Is that what it is? They have to, you have to always be moving. It does it fuck with you right now if you're moving around like, like sometimes like this, like moving and like that. I can't let that goes like this. I can't do, I've never had like real soldier shoulder problems, but I had some of their recently where I shot too many arrows. I uh, I got overzealous with my bow and now I have a 90 pound bow and an 80 pound bow and I shot the 90 pound ball like 150 times a day. It was just way too much. My shoulder just got worn out and it was, it was hurting for like a couple of months.

Speaker 3:          02:03:43       But thankfully it wasn't torn. It was just like tendonitis, like all very mild form of irritated tendons. But now it's 100%. Took like five weeks, five or six weeks. I never had done anything like it. I've loves, luckily it was my right hand cause I'm lefthanded so yeah, it's not good. Shoulders are a weird joint cause shoulders move. Very calculated, very strange ways as opposed to like knees, which just been like a hinge and a shoulder goes bad. It's bad for fighters. It's a real issue for fighters. Like um, they have to get surgery and they don't fight for a year. It's a long time out. It's a career ender for baseball players per pitchers. Yeah. Yeah. I would imagine you have to be really smooth fucking weapon that arm back. Like it's, it's really, can they fix that now or it's still not that they could fix it, but now it's not a career ender anymore. Well it can be. It's all going to, how still can bail, you know, just like the elbow. Wow man,

Speaker 2:          02:04:38       that's it.

Speaker 1:          02:04:38       It's weird when you find out there's parts of your body did they can't fix. Like one of the things that I've found out when I started to have back issues as they want to start cutting things, they want to start getting in there and fucking Yank and shit out. But there's certain things that they just can't fix. Like they've started to give you artificial discs. They started giving those to people like they have, um, they have spacers. Were these a plastic things that they screw in, in the place where you're, you're Mushi disc used to be. And then now they have these titanium rotating disks that they put in your neck and yeah, pretty crazy. And some people, um, in other countries they do that and they don't do it yet. In America, I don't believe so. Some people who get injured in America go to other countries to get your fucking neck cut open. Like Germany does it. And

Speaker 2:          02:05:25       England does it to put a little fake disc and it moves around screws and shit. Which is how you get hit, like what your break and like Bo Jackson, remember Bo Jackson, great baseball and football player. He had a knee, a hip injury. It was the end of his career. That was it. It's just playing baseball for a little while and tried. Yeah, he was the first one that ever played with an artificial hip, but I mean it was never the same. He had so much power. He was able to hit home runs without even over whatever and torrent turning over. You didn't even totally rotate what halfway rotate and he would get pissed. He would break a bat on his leg and how fucking hard that is. The dude, he's a super athlete. That guy, Bo Jackson could have done anything if he wanted to go into MMA, he would have been all checked guy.

Speaker 2:          02:06:05       He was a such a super athlete and they said he barely worked out. Barely lift awake. Yeah, just, just was naturally super strong and just a great athlete will. Chamberlain was supposed to be like that cause I'm from Philly and we always read about him. Oh, imagine, look at the size of the guy. But he was the fastest to, that's the fastest guy on his team. He wasn't, you know, well you remember when Jordan was in his prime and he would literally fly through the air. Yeah. He would fly like nobody had seen anything like that before. Julia serving sort of the sky hook. Right, right. No, that was the hook was a Abdul Jabbar. Oh. But Julia serving was the first one that did the, uh, from the foul line and the dunk contest. Whoa. Really from the foul line, a dunk so crazy that someone can do so fucking big Joe that he could palm a record album to imagine that.

Speaker 2:          02:06:52       Like you could be putting my God, that's insane. That's insane. Yeah. Imagine if Michael Jordan got into MMA was just flying across the fucking Kaeser punching people live because there's levels of athleticism, you know, it's like this, the average guy and then the z above average guy, and there's the guy who was above the above average guy and then there's a super athlete and then there's a Michael Jordan who makes the super athletes, like he's on another level. If Ron James does same thing, right? Yeah. You know, an old buddy of mine is Charles Barkley. Uh, you know, he is, he, uh, was telling me, he goes, look at me. He says, I got my, my size of 32 inches. He goes, I got a definite advantage. He goes, look at that. A little white guy, Scotty Brooks could barely touch the net. Yeah. There's certain physical advantages that are undeniable.

Speaker 2:          02:07:46       Oh yeah. The idea that all men are created equal is fucking preposterous. You could say that the human soul is equal or that you should be equal under the eyes of the law. Yeah. But now they're not an equal. Yeah. You could take all the steroids you want. You never have been able to do it. Michael Jordan did naturally and you can't practice being six 10. That's also a weird thing, isn't it? Where like, uh, where people talk about like performance enhancing drugs should be illegal. They definitely should. But if they are, that means like the super athletes are always going to have an advantage. Just a natural, undeniable advantage in speed and power and the ability to move well, racial differences make a difference. I mean Jimmy, the Greek over here, no they do, but I mean physically, you know, it's incredible. There has not been a weight cornerback in the, in the NFL that I remember in the last 2025 years.

Speaker 2:          02:08:39       What position? That's discrimination. That's why they're quicker. No, they're trying to keep the white men down. Dom, you know, you come on this podcast, he started spreading black propaganda. It's the same thing every time. But I hate all minorities. Joe. Even white people. Yes. When why people would come minority. Maybe everybody relaxed. Also minority talk. It's sort of, it's funny the thing he said about race because on a serious level these guys can't say anything like that's what's so funny about Barkley cause he's black. He can say stuff, right. He says that, I know you can't say it, but I'm going to say it. Whatever it is, you know? Yeah. There's a lot of fucking like things that they used to say like on a regular basis now they can't even say. So they've had to adjust over the last just few years. Yeah. Well everything's so politically correct now and now it's Sam, that Guy Sam got picked up by the cowboys to get got it came out of it and say that he was getting, yeah, so here, that leads with a team so, well I heard that he was, according to Jamie, that he's a, the reason why they picked him up is that the cowboy is the guy who runs the cowboys is into publicity.

Speaker 2:          02:09:48       Oh yeah, totally. That's exactly it. Yeah. He's, he's a moneymaking machine. This guy, the cowboys had been a 500 team for the last 10 years. Probably. They haven't won a Superbowl in 20 years and the the most, they're most valuable per franchise in America. That's incredible. Yeah. That's hard to believe. They have to make any sense. Thanks. Three point $2 billion. Why? How come they don't have to, when they don't have to win because of publicity. First of all, they're called America's team. You know who named them that? The owner themselves. Yeah, the owner. It's that guy named t text gram, but America's team, they got the star and the glitter and the fucking weight is a Dallas cowboys and the dude's names tex. Yeah, he went tech Graham. He wins. Yeah. But I mean he's, he's dead now. But he was the one that created that image.

Speaker 2:          02:10:39       Whatever happened in that show used to do for comedy central. That was a funny show. You used to do like a show with football players. It was called off sides. Well, what happened to it was the timing was bad. You know, if comedy central was as big as they are now, they could have afforded more. But NFL films is so fucking expensive that they just had to lift. And we had good ratings, but it just wasn't, you know, they, they're, they're footage costs so much for us to get, and I had so much fun with the players because they knew I wasn't a journalist, so they were like, I get, uh, you know, Brett Farve is okay. So Reggie White was their star, their team, and he said, he recognized me because man, I saw you on Oprah. And I said, I can't picture you sitting there with a Kleenex box going, I can't believe he's two sisters never met before.

Speaker 2:          02:11:24       They were 21, you know, you know. So, uh, Reggie one that to do with thing with me, he liked doing impressions so far of was was the second biggest star on the team. And he comes up to me, he goes, what are you doing? I said, we're doing it football show for comedy central. You want to do it? He says, well, what do I gotta do? I said, just, you know, fuck you, fuck around. You know, I'm not a journalist, but would just have fun so I could see him. He was a little, had some trepidations about it. I thought I was going to maybe lay into him. I said them so I'm fucking this girl in the ass, right? I mean I'm holding it down and fucked him. Banging a no rubber, no nothing. I aint no pussy. And he starts laughing. He goes, are you allowed to say this? I go, we're not on satellite. Then I'm just trying to make you laugh. And then he got loose and then it, then we had a great interview. When w

Speaker 3:          02:12:10       when you did that, like was the NFL in the same position that's at now? Was it just as popular still? Nfls never dwindled, right?

Speaker 2:          02:12:16       No, it's gotten bigger and bigger but it's bigger now. It was the football is by far the most, I mean I dunno about Nascar, but the regular like athletic sports, football is, football is so fucking big, high school football, college football. Know. I think Nascar is the biggest spectator sport, right, isn't it? I think don't they have places like boarded up 200,000 people or something absurd?

Speaker 3:          02:12:41       Well, you know what happens. Yeah, there's that. But you know what also happens is that like when you go down south, everybody knows about Nascar. I was on the radio once in Atlanta and they just started talking to me about going to Kyle all draw up and Neil Day and this guy, I'm a home hand. It did bring it up. All these names. I never even heard of this guy won the Talladega wrong. I literally, I go, so what are you talking about? And they're like, we're talking about NASCAR. You don't follow Nascar. This guy does not follow Nascar. Like it was so alien to them that I didn't know who any of those guys where it's heard about Dale Earnhardt. What about Dale Earnhardt? So he's still doing it. You know like you hear certain names like escape from that world and

Speaker 2:          02:13:22       I mean, I only know Tony Stewart because he was the guy that accidentally apparently killed that driver that got out of the car. He said, yeah, that was fucked. It was crazy. What the fuck was he thinking to get? The driver got, well Tony Stewart apparently clipped him with his car and spun him out and he was only 20 he's a hothead, 20 year old, you know. Jeez. Amazing. Tony Stewart is going to race again. It did. That's, that's nuts. He raised again and when he came in like 41st it came real slow, Huh? Yeah. He can't be a dick after won somebody over. Imagine if you just fucking balls to the wall clip and everybody now or would it be just very safe driver now he's like giving proper turn single that he's like, I'm going to the racetrack. Is that a normal position for him to be in 40th please?

Speaker 2:          02:14:07       Oh no, he's usually up there at the top. I mean, I don't know that much about it, but I bet he did try to take it slow. Probably. It's probably a real mind. Fuck man. I feel like mom, it's like boom, boom. May have seen the after he killed Duke. Who? Kim, you know, like I, you know, the guy should have been frightened but Raymond was never the same after that. No, no it wasn't. It's one of those things, man, it's, it's hard for guys. It's, it's hard to also, you know, for a boxer, you're dealing with your own mortality too. You know, that's, uh, that's, that's the fight that changed fighting from 15 rounds to 12 did it, he died in the 13th. I believe. He, you know, he had a bleeding on his brain before he got hit. Got in the ring. How do they know that?

Speaker 2:          02:14:50       That's what I read. I don't know. They said that they had whatever, that he shouldn't have been fighting the guy, you know. Well, I know that he was cutting weight and that was also, I think back when they would weigh in the day of the fight. But now they know more about weight cutting. Cause man senior was a lightweight. So that was 135 pounds. And I think that, uh, I think that fight took place as a lightweight fight. I believe. Fought Livingstone bramble he found a lot of great fighters. SARC whale. He came to see me at the Improv one night and uh, we went out to talk and his wife and his kid, we're watching a show and some guy comes up and it goes boom, boom and seen. He goes, can I ask you something when you hit me? Right. And, and I said to the guy, I said, look, you know, I said, they can't hit you Moravians.

Speaker 2:          02:15:41       Really Nice Guy. Do you ever meet him? I'm said hi to him. Real conversation with them. You know, Youngstown, Ohio, like real cool guy and did it all for his father. Great Story. And I said, look man, he can't hit you. You know, like Raymond's like he's, and they said, well, can I hit you then to, to rape me? I said, no, you can't fucking hate him. What are you crazy kind of hit you when he said, he said, I always wanted to see what like a professional punch felt like, Oh God, like the fuck I look, I like to give them an amateur punch. Well now he that dummy, the guy's got a his fucking hands and then put gloves on and then punch you. Either you could break his hands course with the forest that they hit. Yeah. You could easily break your hand on someone's forehead.

Speaker 2:          02:16:24       He's lucky he didn't say it at the Vinny Corto. Vinnie would have probably punched him. Oh God. I did a great thing of any one time. Every tennis what? I Dunno, I brought them up. Okay. We had this crazy fucking nut cocaine head lived upstairs and they will fund to doing this. Yeah, they would fuck. And then you hear the shower and it was like five in the morning and I stay up late. But after a while, like I said, too much gay turned the music down just a little. That's all nice. You know, next day Kim's window was broken in a car. I knew he fucking did it. So I go get Vinny. Vinny looked like fucking, you know, incredibly fucking gorilla. Just cave man 100%. And I get, I get a kick out of him. And I liked the I personally, but, uh, he, he did me a favor, come, we go up and was like, good guy, bad guy thing.

Speaker 2:          02:17:12       And he kicked the door and the kid goes, what? And I go, hey man, I just want to ask. And he sees Vinny and then he changed completely and he goes, uh, you know, uh, uh, my cup, I just wanted to tell you that somebody broke a window. And as your neighbor, I want to warn you that there's somebody around here. So just look out for yourself. And I'm totally not really me. And Vinnie goes, my fucking cousin, he goes, I love him like a brother. He goes, if anybody does fucks with dom, I get these fucking headaches. I don't even know what I'm doing. And the kids go on and the guy goes, no, no, no ma'am, I certainly didn't do it. I go, holy fuck accused you of doing it. Why would you say that? And, and it goes, Vinny said, I sleep on his couch and the afternoon, make sure there's no fucking noise. I'll go fucking great. And that was it. You know, stop. The noise stopped. Everything, stopped everything that he'd see him at the gym. See Vinny pressing 500 pounds at the gym. Yeah. How you doing? How's your cousin?

Speaker 1:          02:18:11       That's a problem with living in apartments. Yeah. I had a guy that lived below me that asked me not, I had a pool table in my living room. I bought this pool table us and I rented this apartment specifically because it had a place for the pool table. This is the place that I lived in. Uh, when I, when I had to stay in la though, the first place I moved in North Hollywood, he signed the lease. I signed the lease and that's what made me stay. And that's the reason why I got all everything, News, radio, everything. But I got this, he was a, it was a loft and it had this big living room and I was like, I get doubt. Like I measured it out. I can definitely get a pool table in here. I'll take it. I tell the guy this, the fucking landlord is, shows it to me.

Speaker 1:          02:18:48       I'm looking for a place, that pool table, he was below me, so, and Lord Yo, yeah, that would the, not the landlord, but the superintendent or whatever it is, the guy, the guy who showed me the place wasn't the actual landlord, what do they call superintendents? And so he's this, this gay guys, really flamboyant gay guy with his boyfriend. And um, he co I, after I put the pool table in, he knocks on the door and he goes, uh, we're having an issue with you walking around. I go, you're having an issue with me walking, just walking. He goes, well, the floor creaks. I hear you walking. What are you supposed to do? I go, okay, well what do you want me to do? And he goes, well, between the hours of 5:00 PM and 10:00 PM, you just not

Speaker 3:          02:19:28       not do that. I go, see, you're asking me not to walk in the living room. I'm not even doing anything. I'm just walking. And he goes, he goes, oh. So I see the game, we're gonna play here. I go of the game, we're gonna play. I go, well, you're telling me is the structural integrity of the apartment that you rented me is not good enough for me to actually be walking. Just walking in the living room between a five hour window every night when you get home to when you go to bed, that's what you want. He goes, yeah, I go, is the fuck is this? I thought that's just crazy. You can't say don't walk like a, what if I just walk around my pool table but I don't play. I just walk in delivery. Like if I have people over and they want to walk around, look out someone.

Speaker 3:          02:20:09       You just have to roll or scoop. How about I put a Webcam. You can tell when I'm walking and when I'm just, when I'm playing pool, so you can't get mad at me. That's fucking apartments. That was just, settlers kept playing pool. Fuck him. I had a guy wouldn't let me do the treadmill. I, I told them, I said, I'll do it anytime that you're not there just to a compromise. Anything I moved to for him, killing me. You're killing my wife. I said, who the fuck a buy in this country? Go back to wherever it came, Tom, I can't believe you took it there. Well yeah. Well it's, I hated the guy. Why did you have to have to go to the immigrant place punchy this country get the fuck back. Who made guy, the guy like when he said to me like, oh I see the game we're playing.

Speaker 3:          02:20:59       I was like, okay, there's no negotiating with you. You're a ridiculous person. I probably thought about it like probably didn't play as much in but it takes the fun out of it. They ain't got to worry about some fucking nut downstairs. It wasn't, it's the crazy thing was it wasn't loud. It wasn't like I moved around. I heard I didn't hear anything when I was walking. I didn't hear shit. I've been in that situation where you hear every single footstep and they had to end up putting carpet just to fix it. Why had a carpet already? It was already carpeted. It's just a shitty building. Cause the lady next door to me, super nice lady, but she would be on her phone and I to hear every fucking word she said like I was listening. I May. It was like, there's no insulation in California.

Speaker 3:          02:21:42       That's the difference between apartments on the east coast and department of the West Coast is those, those fiberglass insulation or the stuff that they pump into the walls to keep retain heat. They don't need that out here, so you got wallboard Stud, wallboard. You basically got a fucking notebook between you and some person who's talking like some pretty intimate shit. Every time she would get a phone call, I would hear her voice, her answering machine go on and I would hear friends leave her messages. That's not good. That was ridiculous. I always think about that. If I'm watching porn and they hear it explore, turn it up really loud when the guy comes, I stopped caring. There'd be there. There is this too many times where I'm just masturbating my and we look over, notice

Speaker 4:          02:22:26       my windows openers to people fencing in my backyard. I'm like, oh you guys fencing? Yeah. They just fence all day. Who fences and your name would be neighbors? My neighbors dress up as pirates and golf people and plants. Burbank, man. Fucking white people in Burbank. They're fencing in your backyard. They make their own costumes though. It's pretty bad ass. But they do. Yeah, they're mean, but very glamorous. Like they're kings and stuff, but pirates. What? I don't know. So do they do like a part of a festival or something? I think they must work at universal or something. Oh, so they're practicing their trade maybe. Hmm. But they also have those sewing things on like are those like things where you so on in their windows, like when you walk by there, just like it looked like people were just standing there. Oh, the mannequins like yeah, those snowing. Yeah. That's wow. I guess they bake a lot of clothes. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          02:23:20       When are you going to play dress up and make your own shit? It's probably more satisfying. It's probably what we were talking about. Eating the food that you kill. Extra satisfying when you're out there at fucking comic con Alpha that you created yourself. We were in Sacramento this past weekend. I did a, the punchline you have do the punchline Sacramento go. Oh, what a great fucking club. Oh, I love it. Perfect club. Perfect size bar in the back. Low ceiling. Tight seated. Ah, we had so much fun there but a while we were in town, it was there for the UFC and there was some sort of an anime convention, like some sort of address up. Dork fest was hilarious. Just what's up layer layer. What is that? The convention. What's layer? What is that? The thing that I was watching in Sacramento. How do you know?

Speaker 1:          02:24:11       Are you just making shit up? That's not what they were doing. You're wrong. 100% they were dressing like anime characters. You Fuck? He's just this. Jamie's into it. He's like Qt, prudential. Norman to who? Both this but how about renaissance, right? We're not talking about renaissance. Fair of Jamie Layer. This must be it the fuck out of here. There's 100 million of those things. I love it though. It's cool because dorks getting opportunity, they get an opportunity to hang out with other doors, get outside, get a little vitamin D, renaissance faire, any of these things? Well, this is an anime thing because people were dressed up like superheroes and some people were dressed up like furries. There was like a lot of weirdness going on that came out of Japan, right? Furries,

Speaker 4:          02:24:51       uh, yeah. Enemies. Just pretty much Japan animation in their style.

Speaker 1:          02:24:58       Do you ever perform in Japan, dom, that your people know he's the Escobar? It's not funny. It's a the Moo. My eyes were opened. I knew you back in the day. I got a picture of Joey Diaz. I'm going to put on Instagram later today. I got his headshot that I found in my office, so he used to have on the wall is from, he was walking 220210220 pounds. Crazy. I can't believe it's the

Speaker 3:          02:25:23       same guy. We'll see ways is three, depends on how high he is. When you ask him wasn't dog. He used to go on stage and he would talk on stage. He goes, listen dog, I'm 45 years old. I got no time for this bullshit. I'm 50 years old. I got no time. And again, the same set, we'll give you three or four different ages. Went through the fat blob. He's like, don't talk about it. It's just my little thing. It's just a little fat bomb thing that he had to get removed from his like shoulder head. So it was weird. He told me, he just said, I love that guy. I fucking love that guy. Love him to death. He's so much fun. There's no more fun guy to be around. Like, like when you bring him to shows, like everybody's funnier to the show's funnier.

Speaker 3:          02:26:05       The comics on the show or funny or you're funny, you're backstage. Everybody is funnier. I love him too. And where's the CO headline? A couple of times. What a blessed, so much fun. I told you what he said to me, right? What? I said, Joe, I don't care who goes on first or second, whatever you want. It goes dumber. Ever tell you what, why don't you close the first shows and I'll close the second. So you don't have to follow a fucking pig lake me and then you could do it and then you can do it at the laugh factor if you want. I said, so you're not only do me a favor, you threaten, you get me spots and other clubs. He said he's a great dude. He is. His podcast is doing fantastic too. And that's one of the things that I really love about the Internet, that um, you know, a guy like Joey could be Joey.

Speaker 3:          02:26:45       He would never, no one would ever understand him unless he saw him in the uncensored form, like on this pilot and I never understand. Or his podcast dose in that kid that still does that. You'd give him mushrooms yet it gives him stuff. He doesn't tell him who Joey to what kid is it little friend that always hanging, what is his name? Lee. Yeah, he doses him. Yeah. It keeps those to them like fucking like roofie in him while he's not fucking him. I don't have a problem with that. If you're around Joey. No, not to eat any of the shit. He toast Burke. Chrysler's Dad. I know Keith Burke crisis dad edible weed, and it bursts like, what are you doing? And He's like, his dad was like, oh, I'm just eating some candy that Joe gave. He goes, that's how I can listen. Cock sucker. You Dad's gotta live gotta live. He's Tom Ziglar has a fucking hilarious story about the same thing that I said about getting high with Joey on the plane where he's, he just throwing down these Chiba Chews. That's Joe Joey in the middle of a panic attack, like eight another cheap shoes.

Speaker 3:          02:27:57       He doesn't give a fuck man. He goes deep. He's one of the funniest people I know. He's bad comedy store. Yeah, he said that it's been a good challenge that, that he forgot how, how that room was. You know, when you're on stage, well they don't know you that you don't, they don't know your comment there for Jelly. Yeah. Yeah. It's a different kind of a group. You know, you've got to develop material that like, you set it up differently. You got to introduce it differently because they're not expecting you to be that this raucous, crazy, you know, giant Cuban guys done a ton of coke in his life, you know what I mean? They don't know what to what, what he's doing. They just see a guy on stage and then they have to slowly but surely be introduced to his ideas. What's going on there, whether it's they're trying to stop people from smoking weed where at the college. Is that true?

Speaker 4:          02:28:42       There's a rumor that uh, that, that might be true, but not the management. Like, you know, what are you going to stop,

Speaker 3:          02:28:50       go hide in the back? That sounds like the dumbest idea ever. That's like telling football players and stopped doing steroids. Yeah. That's so stupid. Yeah. What do you think keyless, the comedy star, what are you gonna do to stop him from drinking too?

Speaker 4:          02:29:02       Well, it's just one person that wants to do it and then he's not, I mean, that's ridiculous.

Speaker 3:          02:29:06       He have power that one person. No, I doubt it. I have no idea. His name rhymes with Pauly shore. I Dunno. I don't go there anymore. I'm just talking about in my ass. Yeah, that going to go now? I don't think so. I can't. I talk to Scotty, Scotty shores, my buddy, I talked to him when I was down in San Diego. I was like, just say I just too much of a bad feeling about that place. I love when you come in for breaking balls. I love doing your show, your show the laugh back. See the laugh factory doesn't have any negative feeling to me. Especially now, you know. Now it seems like there's like a whole new crew there. It's a kind of a different, yeah, different sort of a vibe there.

Speaker 4:          02:29:47       But you, if you go to the comedy store ever, especially everyone that you've met through desk while like Justin Martindale, Tony Jeremiah, they're just everywhere now and there. It's all positive. It's like a huge family and when somebody from the outside comes in, it's like a whole family looking at that person. Yeah, but the person that comes in doesn't want you smoking weed and I'm going to smoke weed. If I go to the comedy store, we all do it. What if, what if you get banned from smoking weed? I have a license.

Speaker 3:          02:30:10       No, you can't just can't say I have a lifestyle that the liquid smoke in your house. Well you know we were upstairs when we, when, when it's private. Just the acts really let you smoke inside upstairs. Oh Hey this isn't blowing it down. All those people get the show better as glass nail in between. So yeah, that's a great thing. He's got it set up up there. That's a sweet thing. Other than when they're in between shows like Friday and Saturday with the two shows. It's, it's basically a club for the acts. We can relax. I don't mind going there. I, you know, I, I like the laugh factor when I do it with you. It's got a good vibe, you know? Oh I love it. I love that shit with you. Thanks. I always fun with the interview. Yeah. If you ever seen breaking balls with dom Irrera he does a show, he fucks around with the audience, does material that brings up a comic and then fucks around with the comic inbetween and then brings up the next comic relief. Yeah, it's fun. It's fun. It's fun because you know, Don, you're, you're at your best. Well I wouldn't say it. You're at your best. You're always, I mean, you're always funny on stage, but I, I love the particular type of funny when you just fucking around. That's, that's what I liked. Yeah. Like when we did

Speaker 1:          02:31:20       the, uh, kill Tony shared with the ice house. Yeah. We were crying and lift. Oh, so fun. It was so fun. That was, that was really, really, really fun. And for those comics to get a guy like you fucking with them and you know, talking about their material. I mean, a lot of those guys, it was the first time they ever went onstage. That's amazing. Imagine that the first time you ever go on stage and you get a guy who's been doing comedy forever, it's been on HBO, a legend in comedy, and he's critiquing your act. That's, that's, he's busting your balls. It's as good as you could ever hope for. I mean that's a beautiful moment. The idea killed Tony is a great idea. That should be a comedy central show. She's totally sell. That shit is on the schedule. It's a great idea.

Speaker 1:          02:31:56       Comics do a minute, you know it's, and it's especially fun. We did it at the Ice House because the ice house has such a good feeling to it and then the room is perfect. Yeah, this is totally rooms good. Just like the belly room. Yeah, about the same size amount of seats. Right. Belly rooms, like a hundred seats, 90 seats, so it was that room with the Ice House has an annex. They have a big room, which is not a big room. Anyway, the big room was only like 190180190 something like that. And then they have the smaller room, which is only about 80 or 90 and it's fucking amazing.

Speaker 4:          02:32:29       Yeah. I liked that main room. I think that's my favorite room cause that's barely ever used. It was, and it used to be such a famous room.

Speaker 1:          02:32:37       Started there three, three Saturday night shows out. Yeah. But the main room late at night when there's only like 10 people in the room, like it's fucking sad.

Speaker 4:          02:32:46       Yeah, no, no. Unless it's like Brody Stevens or something. I prefer those where it's just him.

Speaker 1:          02:32:53       I was in the main room once back in the Joey Diaz days with Joey Diaz had, uh, Jeff, you know Jeff the piano man [inaudible] he had Jeff play Ozzy Osborne and he got on stage and took his shirt off and he's singing war pigs. He's singing at Joey Diaz is singing on stage. And it was fucking one of the greatest things I've ever seen in my life because he's completely committed to it. He had no shirt on. And the audiences, maybe there was for audience members and the rest of the audience was, all comics were all just hanging out. And Joey deals is onstage and they're fucking with the lights. No, it wasn't. It wasn't Jeff. It was the other guy who did the, the main room. Mike. Fuck, is that his name? Mike. The guy with the glasses? Yeah. Yes. Great Dude. Who was in a band? Another guy. He didn't have classes.

Speaker 1:          02:33:44       He was in a band. You remember that guy? I was like, what's up dude? Hey Dude. Yeah, he's still there. What's his name? Uh, Shit. Do you know what I'm talking about? I think I got the wrong guy. I was talking about Mike who is the manager of playing piano. No, no, no, no. I know you're talking about the guy who handled the sound and the shit. Now it's not Jeb, Danny, Danny, Danny, Danny, Danny. Danny is playing a war. Pigs, you know, and uh, and Joey Diaz is on stage screaming the lyrics too, along with the sound that's coming over the loudspeaker, which is, you know, Ozzie

Speaker 3:          02:34:18       and they're doing like the different color lights, like Joey's on stage. And I just sat back and we were all barbecued. We're all completely baked out of her mind. Sat back and laughed and we were all just clapping and just, it was such a pure performance. It's great cause he wasn't trying to impress anybody. There was no one there to see him. There was no audience. It was just us having fun and like, like I said, maybe four people in the crowd maybe. Yeah. That's some shit that only takes place at the comedy store. I, that's why I love it. It feels like you're just hanging out with your friends, getting wasted, you know, and having fun and getting, it's just playing around in, you know, doing silly shit. And you would think because it's the comedy store that it would be packed all the time.

Speaker 3:          02:35:02       It's the gut is getting in. Let her location. No you can't. It's got this name. You know, like when I was a, uh, an open miker we'd heard about the comedy store. It was like Mecca. It was like I would always wanted to be at the comedy store, you know, to me like getting, becoming a paid regular at the comedy store was more important that getting my first television show. It's interesting. Yeah. Cause it was, it was, that was the spot that was her Kinison came from. That was what prior came from. They all started the comedy store. So when I was there and you would, I would show up the first time I was there, it wasn't even half full. I was, I was there at the, in the or and like some terrible actors on stage, some fucking singing, nothing. Some was blue. It was dog shit. And I remember going, this is the common, he's like, what the fuck is going on? But this is this place. I would expect it to be like when you see live in the sunset strip, like a line around the block, the WHO's who of Hollywood's, they're the greatest comics in the world are all going up. Nope. It was like

Speaker 2:          02:36:04       when I first went out, what year was that? 85. It was like that was it. Like that was the Kinison days, right? Yeah. Yeah. Well I first went there and uh, he used to go on right before Sam at the end. Wow. Um, we became friends, a lot of, a lot of laughs. A lot of, a lot of fucking lips to blow with them. What's that?

Speaker 3:          02:36:24       Did you ever do blow with him? No. I thought he said, did you ever blow? Did he ever offer it to, you know, he knew

Speaker 2:          02:36:31       me. He knew I wasn't, I see the thing about Sam and I, we were, it could be friends, but I'm not a follower and I don't want to be a leader either, but I just rather just paying and you know, I was, I like, I would never be part of his entourage. Yeah. He had a whole cult of following. Right. And the outlaws. Yeah. And, but we had a lot of fun together. I mean, we had a lot of laughs. I was always glad when he was there. I passed the first time I auditioned there and then she forgot me. So then I had to audition again, you know? But yeah, it was fun. It was amazing. You know, cause I remember him, Roseanne couldn't get on in the main room and couldn't get on. She couldn't get a spot in the main room. When was this?

Speaker 2:          02:37:14       In 85 she couldn't. I thought she was already huge in 85 no, this was probably later than 85 yeah, I always heard that. Right when she moved here. She got to show the same day. Yeah, she means she was giant. Oh No. Oh God. Look, I remember working in Vegas with her and she couldn't get on that. She was good. She, she all she wanted, there was a spot in the first show. Main Room. Why that was the money spots cause that's when we would all make four or $500, which was a lot then, you know, write, write, write town. I used to make, well I started out at the comedy store in Hawaii. I went, I had a very circuitous route to the comedy store in Hawaii. I did the Hawaii with Barry Sobel and carry snow. Then I went to, uh, I went to a la Jolla, did well there, went to Vegas and that went well.

Speaker 2:          02:37:59       And then I went that. And so I didn't really start doing the common story until I had done like the tour. Wow. That weird. They had a Westwood one too, right? That was a little before my time. Westwood. It was on West Wood Avenue in the Westwood one was where Kennison really like started out. That's where you're really like develop. Apparently I took a friend of mine who's a priest, is the reason I went in to see the, the room and Sam was on and my friend's hair was back. I said, it's not always like this. It's, especially back then, nobody knew who Sam was. Nobody saw that coming. Oh, it was fucking incredible. Incredible energy. Yeah. That, um, the comedy store had a whole like series of clumps and now they're down to how many were there and they were all consumed. People owned them. Well, there was a dog.

Speaker 2:          02:38:45       Mitzi. Yeah. Yeah. Well, not the same people. Same One person. All right. Yeah. Let's see. You still make a lot of money in Vegas, man. Yeah. Why don't they out? Well, obviously now it's a mass, but so what, think the comedy store in Vegas would be a no brainer. You know, what happened to the original one? They should, they should have. They raised it because, uh, the Bellagio bought it out. That's where the Bellagio is now. I would think that, um, that would be a no brainer for a franchise. I mean Improv's are all over the country. It's amazing that the comedy store never, yeah, the impact is really knew how to franchise it. And Jamie and Jamie's doing it too. Yeah. Yeah. With Chicago and Vegas. Right. You were just in the laugh factory back in Chicago with me. I'm going there in October by the, I give you a $2 to do a full weekend, but you'll be at laff factory. It's a lot of money for a of factory. He really off for your shit. Money. I usually air allegedly and we're on the air. Allegedly. He got a pair of deal allegedly now they fixed it. I have no, I have no tech. Nope.

Speaker 2:          02:39:51       That's what makes you funny. If you had tacked, we'd get in the way of a lot of good jokes. Thank you. Joseph would right? Yeah. Tact with the fucking shitty old for you.

Speaker 9:          02:40:00       Hey Dominic, smoothing out your mess and how you got a know mess.

Speaker 2:          02:40:09       I didn't know herpes couldn't move to the, but I, from talking about earlier

Speaker 3:          02:40:13       herpes, you could shut the fuck up. I think that um, Mitzi like had an issue with like the idea of franchising because they had to be comedy store comics and if you had franchise a certain point in time, you seen it down, the more we need 365 days a year, you know, she would have a seven night a week show at 365 days a year of good comics and you're flying him out to Louisville, Kentucky. Good luck. There's no one's going to do a week. No. I mean this is Vegas clubs. Like they used to do that at the Riv. Right. You would do Monday through Sunday. You'd do the whole week. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          02:40:43       Yeah. You'd have to, you'd have to stay for seven days. I go and get calls from buddies. Yeah. They didn't make me do that. I did Thursday through Sunday. I just did Friday and Saturday. I did the late night shows because I couldn't do the regular show at the river. I could only do remember that extreme, extreme extreme. You and Slayton. Yeah. Thank God I would, I couldn't do it. I can't, I can't do Vegas from more than a couple of days. I Love Vegas for a couple of days. It was killing me. How many days you do this past one. Uh, for, but I went in early and it came, came back late and so Wednesday through Monday or something like that. Yeah. That, that's when I, cause I didn't want to fly in the heat. Right. Like go to the floor. I can't fucking take that. I didn't intend to Greece. I'm very delicate artists. What's your favorite place to work in Vegas?

Speaker 7:          02:41:31       Yeah.

Speaker 3:          02:41:31       Uh Oh God. That's what Beth to see. That's, that's a bad question is a bad question. Why? Because you just worked for Jamie. You don't want to tell the truth. Well you know it was for act like to tell you it was fun. It was a fucking great job. Was I opened for Cher for years in the early nineties when we did the Mirage. The Mirage is great. They used to call me easy money cause I would be at the sports book and this is when I could still fucking jump. I'd hop over to fucking rail just a minute to eight because everything starts on time there. Boom. I fucking slide across the stage, do my stew, 25 minutes and then I go in the back of the crew fucking with me. They'd have a chair and a towel and water. You'll KZ money. All right guys. Almost a 26 tonight. I went crazy.

Speaker 3:          02:42:16       That was a fun game. You say hop over the sports book. We betting. Yeah. So you'd gamble up until the moment you're supposed to go on stage and he'd run. It was a big gambler, but yeah, I would bet on games and stuff. I like to watch it. I like it to stretch out. I don't want to put everything on black and then leave a fucking loser. Well if you, especially like if you're a sports fan, it makes the game more exciting, right? Oh yeah. Well that makes everything, I mean that's what I love about Benton football. Like, like with the pro football starting tomorrow night. I fucking love it. I love the over under the over under is, yeah, I loved that because especially if you're, I'm pretty over because you rooting for everybody. It's all positive. Like the unders, all negative. Don't drop that tear drop that peers can get that motherfucker.

Speaker 3:          02:42:57       I was like, but the overall is fun. Yeah. Positive beddings by the negative Bennett. Yeah. There's a cheer sometimes in Vegas. If you watch a boxing match, they'll have an over under on how many rounds? The bet that and then it'll hit the fifth round. Everybody goes like there's a roar in the crowd. Yeah. Like I think it was Larry Merchant that actually brought it up once during a broadcast. Yeah. The reason why these people were cheering because cause they gambled won it. Yeah. There's a lot of proposition bets like that. Like you could bet a bunch of fights parlay. Put them all together if you get them all right. It's sane amount of money. Never. Aubrey is a big gambler. He always Campbell's in Vegas. He's never hit that shit yet. He's gotten close though. It's always one shit. Judge's decision fucks you up. I can't get into it.

Speaker 3:          02:43:46       Gambling on fights, gambling on anything. Why not even slot machines and all that stuff. It's just for fun. It's not right. Like I'm addicted to it or cards. Nothing. Bedding. It's probably good. Yeah, it's probably good that you don't do that. I just don't know shit. It just hit me. I realized my favorite club to work in Vegas. Bread, carrots club cause it working there in October. I can't believe it. It just hit me. Use Club was a Tropicana, but now I didn't just hit up a memory. Lost it for real. A real memory loss. You always talk about Brad Garret's. I was waiting for you to bring it up. I was wondering why. I thought you were out of reverence to Jamie. Well, it's, it gets my bread. I was, I worked for dad out of body, but the Mike Collab is bad. You got to see his club with these fucking chicks there.

Speaker 3:          02:44:29       Switch one that Brad Carrow. I'm like, God, they got, did you ever since you book a weekend when I'm there for UFC, I would love to MGM. Right? How often? Uh, yeah, downstairs. The Mgm, it looks Nice. I pass by it. I've never performed there. We did that once. I remember we had a couple of times I was there for your uh, your fights. Yeah, but I never got to see you at Brad Garrett. Um, there's a bunch of UFC is coming up. So how often do you go to, to Vegas? How often you do it? Three. Three or four times a year. What about January? You got anything booked in January? The weekend of January 2nd. That's the weekend. The UFC is going to be in Vegas like great fights too. It's like I could do that. Let's do it doable and you can come during the day. You can see the fight started for so you could watch the fights from like, what's the first show at eight?

Speaker 3:          02:45:13       There's only one show. What time is it? I don't know if you'd get them to do it at 10. That's the shit. But dumb. Get them. Do it a 10. You can see all the fisticuffs then get over there with ample time and then eat mushrooms at 11 what is it? It's, it's at the MGM sometimes. Sometimes at Mandalay bay. Sometimes MGM. Those are the only two places I was at the palm one time. They used to do it at the palm. They don't do it at the palm anymore. Dana White, uh, he gambles too much and he broke them. Smash the palm. Yeah. Did he really? Yeah, he smashed him. They banned them when they banned them. He pulled the UFC out and they started doing the smaller events at the hard rock. He was winning. Oh yeah. Wow. He wins. He wins. Big Man. He Bent, he loses big money, but he gambles big money.

Speaker 3:          02:45:57       He gets crazy. You like $1 million a night. Wow. Oh my God. Yeah. I don't get it. I don't know how you could do that. It's like keep a pulse and not fucking scares me. Sweat all your blood out. It seems like, it just seems like I would if I lost $1 million in a night, I was totally quit. But he's won like five or six months, not really gambling. You know what gambling is? If you have a plot, a guy who's better equal to you and pull and you play pool, that's gambling. Right? But you're not, you know these fuck casinos wouldn't have crystal chandelier is that people really gambling? The odds are set against them. They definitely are set against you. But if you're good at certain games like blackjack, yeah, there's a more of a level field. I mean certain things are fucking ridiculous.

Speaker 3:          02:46:39       Slot machines. Desert ridiculous. Yeah. They post the rigged. It's not even like it's a machine. Like they set them, they can set them to easier or harder. Like they can decide whether or not you're going to win or lose. Like they could set it. So it's one person wins a month, you know video poker to you. Yeah, because you sit there, you get the drinks. What ain't nobody you'd under no anybody like blackjack toys. Like keep your hands off the table, sir. Not like that. Crazy. People get pissed at you. I've heard people say that like if you, if you're playing blackjack at a bad table, when someone doesn't know what they're doing, they fuck up the hand. How could they fuck? I mean, I see what they're saying, but that's a weird way of looking at it that they fuck up your hand. Like what kind of a whack ass game are you playing with someone else?

Speaker 3:          02:47:24       Making shitty decisions affects you. They affect the card count. Yeah. They make the, you know, whenever I'm craps too, I don't even understand that fucking name, that deck games. Ridiculous. You've got to know too much. Yeah. Richard. Jenny used to have a bit about crabs. It's fucking funny. Bit Too. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. About how he doesn't like a certain games because like he, he, he liked games where nobody knows what the fuck is going on. That's what this whole thing about craps. So funny bit man, that he did that bit like on the tonight show, I think. I never saw that. I used to love his ref bit. Let's see if we can find it. See, see if you can find Richard Jenny on craps and we'll, we'll end with this at a respect for our late friend Mitch, the Jenny. He's a guy we've talked about a hundred times on the, on the podcast that, uh, he doesn't get enough respect.

Speaker 3:          02:48:13       Fucking great. Stand the, Oh yeah, man. When he was, when he was the best, when he like in the late eighties ish, somewhere around there like 88 89 he was one of the best, one of the best in the country. Just did, but didn't get that sort of like the same respect like Kennesaw. I think rich is brilliant. I don't think he had the charisma. That's my x that are not as good as him or put, get bigger than him because you know, is this a Brian? No, no. Richard. Jeni craps on craps. Just written no, but on crap. That's why it, cause that's it. This came up as the second. Okay, let's give her a shot.

Speaker 10:         02:48:51       Okay.

Speaker 3:          02:48:57       We're stressor. He dressed like a guy who he's on a boat.

Speaker 10:         02:49:05       Oh, always can always in a good mood around holidays. I had a great thanksgiving boy. I was so thankful. Thankful on Thanksgiving. Yeah. Look at that Turkey and I'm thinking, Hey, life is tough and you have problems, but nobody ever cuts a hole in your ass and filled you with mushrooms. Wow. Bravo. Jay Leno was edging. Imagine problems without bringing up that model of self restraint. President Bill Clinton won a guy. Gotta give him credit. You gotta give the Guy I can't get my girlfriend. The smoke, the Gar. Backtrack. I guess the thing that annoys people is, you know, you kind of want the president to be a hero when it turns out, you know, Clinton is just like every other stupid guy. He can't turn down oral sex. He can't. You get no Guy Dad, because I couldn't buy in to do activities. No guy ever gets tired up one sec to not moving at all so big they can't believe it's happening.

Speaker 10:         02:50:02       At the same time, there's been able to remote in exam, which going, those are the big Joe. I'm not moving. I'm with my girl can talk. What's better than, I don't know if this is the cramps bit. Hopefully this is really one at a time, Huh? No. You know, I think she'd be president. You hear me out here? Jack Kevorkian. You know why he doesn't lie. This guy has nerve [inaudible] himself and 60 minutes ending a guy's life so you can get arrested on purpose and if he's going to fix it, he's going to starve himself in jail as a protest. Now that is courage. That's commitment. That's the guy standing up and saying, hey, I don't want to live. If it means I can kill other people. Nerve nerve. I mean think about it. Think of a comparison. You Know Bill Clinton commits adultery live and squirmed and would've been if it was single person Jack and warhead commit first degree murder and broadcast on national television. He is not the type of guy with Jay. No, I didn't do it. Not Him. He'd be on the White House lawn having sex with an intern and doing bong hits out of the death machine.

Speaker 10:         02:51:17       How much time is listening to us? Okay,

Speaker 3:          02:51:23       did give it a little bump and it has been to make the segue.

Speaker 10:         02:51:27       Well, I'm happy if it's doing its job. Mean it was depressing out gravy was pointed right at his crotch and he goes, Dave, nope. Anyway.

Speaker 3:          02:51:41       Jessa isn't that weird? That sort of tonight's show type comedy where you have like seven minutes, five minutes. Yeah. Sort of rushing that every bit I hate. Right in those sets. I, last time I did it was a Jimmy Fallon and I had fun because I liked Jimmy and then you know the band, but it's like they're still fucking when he was doing his show or the TV show, his show. Yeah. It's hard. It's hard. It's not real comedy. It's a uh, like a clue. It's like the difference between a preview to a movie and the actual movie itself. Yeah, I think that's a good way of putting it.
