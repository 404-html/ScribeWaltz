Speaker 1:          00:00:01       This is real, this is live is really happening. This is what the Joe Rogan experience podcast is brought to you by the fleshlight. I was going to get that. Go ahead. If you go to Joe Rogan.net and click on the link for the flashlight and enter in the code name Rogan, you will get 15 percent off. Number one, sex toy for a man. That's it. That's the end. Is there a number two? Number two flashlight. Is there a number two? Number two, what? Sex Toy? That's a good question. What is number two? Your hand going to shut off the music,

Speaker 2:          00:00:39       right?

Speaker 1:          00:00:45       Number two is probably one of those standard blowup dolls I bought. That still gets action. I will never use one of the. I don't think. No, I don't know anybody who does that. Maybe stanhouse.

Speaker 3:          00:00:55       You have one? Have you used them to Joanna? Angel wine and it's a. It feels like it. You're one of those racks like at the pool. You know, it smells like a raffle. I fucked a lot of RAF. Yeah. Does that. So maybe I shouldn't have. Yeah. Feels like it. So. Oh God. So it's just kind of a whole. Yeah. And what's cool though is the one I have a, I have you take out the fleshlight out of it, the, the case like fish in the bucket thing and he put it through the whole of the blowup doll. Then it's okay, but then you're still feeling like you're fucking, you're saying take the

Speaker 1:          00:01:25       insides of a flashlight, the good feeling part and stuff it into that hole.

Speaker 3:          00:01:29       Yeah. I said that you could do it in a gas tank as well. Just stick a fucking put clothing on the doll and it kind of is on the car. Oh yeah. Well I think you're even more fucked up to pretending that things a purse. Well that makes me, I swear to God, it makes me a little sick to my stomach. Thinking about how is it when you're especially horny or lonely or what? Neal Brennan is talking like Neal Brennan? Yeah. Hey guys.

Speaker 1:          00:02:00       Indian slash producer, character slash director slash just all around Hollywood bed.

Speaker 3:          00:02:05       I'm starting to realize something about myself, which is a standard. Like I like, I like talking. You like talking? Yeah. Meaning like I like Chapelle one time, said he'd made a fortune, he talked his way into a fortune and which always, and now I realize what he means just because I've been doing a lot of road shows and gigs and shit and you just have to talk, right? But you got to go do radio and talk and talk and talk and you just. And I go, Oh yeah, I like talking. It doesn't feel like work to me to go when people are like, do you hate doing ready? I'm like, I don't know. You go and tell jokes and be funny. Maybe you think of something new. It seems all right to me. It doesn't bother me.

Speaker 1:          00:02:45       Well, you're a, you're a writer as well. And writing is so much more difficult to just talk and shit.

Speaker 3:          00:02:52       Ah, well that's what made me realize that this guy, Alan Stevens or seven comedian, uh, he wrote for and he said, he goes, I'm actually not even a writer. I'm just a bullshitter. Which is like, I know what he means now. Like I, I really want. The minute he said it, I was like, I'm a bullshitter too. Like I write better jokes, just talk and I can write good jokes writing, but I'll. They can, they'll get a little bit better if there's a social center.

Speaker 4:          00:03:19       Yeah, there's some that just only come out when you talk to.

Speaker 3:          00:03:23       Yeah. Is there some about like the pressure of having that human thing that you need to please, particularly if they're comedians that you like and respect. That's why I like writing with a guys. I'm friends with you because it's like, Eh, I don't want to, first of all, don't want to have to pitch to a guy that I secretly don't think is funny.

Speaker 4:          00:03:42       Yeah. And there's something about bouncing some of off likeminded people's heads that also allows you to come up with some shit. You know, when you know a guy's already got several steps of the puzzle figured out along with you and that Nigga. What the fuck? Yes. The other thing is the,

Speaker 3:          00:03:58       there's that Chappelle used to say that he and I were like thrilled killers where he'd like stabbed the person and I'd be like, good her fucking head off Dave because you're just so like, you're like, you want to one up that person. Then he went up to you and then and then you got like a vineyard, you're talking and then you really don't know.

Speaker 4:          00:04:17       Well, that's always offends me when people put comedians on the line for really, really outrageous shit. They said onstage as if they really mean that drives me nuts sometimes because half of what we do is try to say the most fucked up thing. Like you didn't just fucking go there. Like when you're talking to a bunch of comics and you're hanging out with comics, we, you know, we're going to go, we're going to go to the most fucked up place possible because that's the only way to make the person laugh, to get us to. That gets us off anymore. I mean, we endorsed the idea of whenever it is beastiality anything,

Speaker 3:          00:04:55       you know what I mean? Like I'm not, like, there's nothing in my, and I'm like, this is a fact, this is written in stone and this. It's like, here's, here's an idea, here's another idea. Doesn't mean that if your brain goes there, yeah. It goes back to that tracy argument of like what Morgan tracey Morgan the other night at the comedy store, I do a joke about a mark twain and how they're taking all the words out of Huckleberry Finn and I ended up saying nigger like seven times. No one's ever had a problem with that at all black rooms because I never say it as myself. Of course I say it as in yes. Finally a girl in the audience goes, no, and I'm like, what? She goes, you can't say it. And I was like, why? Why can't a black girl? I go, why can't I?

Speaker 3:          00:05:44       And she's like, well, I don't in here and call you cracker. And I was like, well, you just did. That's a. and I didn't, didn't bother me at all. Got The show back. Got It. Righted the ship. We ended up talking for about an hour after the show. Me and the girl and she was like, I go, you know, before I did that joke, I specifically did jokes about Mexicans and Asians and you didn't have any problem with that. She was like, no, I didn't have. And I go, so you, your problem is with racism against black people, but not all racism. You're fine with racism at large, but you're cool with it, but you're against it when it's against black people. Which she's like, yeah, I'm a hypocrite. So we ended up having like a half hour discussion. She walks away. She one of these people who like, she's never lost an argument in her life, like, just didn't even when I wasn't.

Speaker 3:          00:06:32       So like she doesn't know why I won the argument. She walks away. You and I know. Uh, she knows. Yeah, she walks, she walks away and uh, and her husband goes, here's the problem. And he goes, I know that you don't have any hate in your heart. Problem is she does. She does have. So she had, she had said during the conversation that's been dropped on you, that dude's a week away from telling that bit. Well, no, he just say that to random people at the comedy store. She's got her heart. You. Well, he wasn't saying it like that. He was just saying it like she's got like she is up the mind that white people are constantly saying the n word and it's like, no, we're not. I've, I told her, you know how many times I've heard it without a speak for yourself saying that he's saying that she said she recognizes the argument that she thinks that white people are constantly using the emerald wise will run around.

Speaker 3:          00:07:23       It's like if a guy uses the n word in that way, if he's not, if he's not being funny because there's no humor to it. I did get disgusted. That's how many times I haven't even heard it without a sense of humor or I go, maybe I've heard it five times and I have, I have, I have definitely were mostly. Did you hear it in Jersey? Yeah, I heard it in Boston a lot. Oh, right. I heard that. I've heard a guy at times, you know, I've been around people that were looking to jump racists. It's creepy. It's creepy to here, you know, and these fucking Niggas and they go, Whoa, whoa, Whoa, whoa. Yeah, whoa. Yeah. Just because some black people did some fucked up shit, you know. Have you ever seen gone with the wind? Yeah, I think I have, but it was a long time ago.

Speaker 3:          00:08:13       That is the most racist movie in the whole entire world. I just watched it from my first time recently. I think it was 1930. I don't think I've ever watched watches 39 because the guy, one guy a directed a gone with the wind and wizard of Oz in the same year, but he did wizard of Oz. Well that makes completely sense because I, because I thought it feels like the wizard of Oz but racist and, and there was the same like production design in the same feeling of it. The, there was one scene where it was late at night and there was like tons of little white children in their beds. And then there's this black child cranking this fan to fan all the white children when they slept. Yes. Oh my God. There was the part where the main actors, the one that Clark Gable says, you know, frankly my dear, I don't give a damn that girl, like she has like a slave and she's like slapping the slave in the face because she wouldn't shut up or something like that.

Speaker 3:          00:09:07       It is so uncomfortable to watch and then you realize the Clark Gable guy like I don't know what ethnicity he is. He, he was like from Glendale or something like that. Like I never thought this was supposed to be like this, like, like handsome, striking young man. But he looked like somebody. This guy. Like he, he, it was weird. What do you mean? Like he didn't look like a leading man. So like you're used to like the rock say like a big manly hands had this guy looked like a little rocket. The rocket will know you're talking about he racially, he looked, he looked. He just like for back then it seemed like such a racist movie then. Then they had like, they would have gone after him now. Yeah. It would have felt like a little Mexican looking dude. Yeah. Like one of those standard Mexicans like Oscar de la Hoya, Mexicans, maybe it was stolen, but gone with the wind I thought was a creepy ass movie.

Speaker 3:          00:09:55       So that's the, the woman who won the, uh, the academy award for it yet for playing a maid. And by the way, she was the best person in the movie. That chick I could fucking watch all day. She was hilarious. But, uh, the, the whole thing though is so creepy because now they have the intermissions and the opening sound. What used to play in the movie theater, sitting there for 15 minutes in the middle of the making about listening to piano music, thinking about racism winds like what is the plot of them who wins? You know what? I was just so fascinated with the racism that I don't even remember what the plot was. Shit, man. It was freaking me out. The video, the image of the black boy fanning. Oh, it's creeped and there's so many little things like that in the movie put to wizard of Oz feeling to it.

Speaker 3:          00:10:45       Now, do you think that this movie is supposed to reflect the genuine racism of the era that it was depicting or 39. So it wasn't even. There were still people alive from that time. Like when was 39? Yeah. Wow. It was the first color movie, I believe that. Or one of the first color movies. Yeah. Wow. Yeah. I think it might've been the, the first. Uh, but, but the. Yeah, I don't, I think that it was so it's not like it was made in [inaudible] 78 and they were taking like, there were still black people still couldn't vote when the movie came out. They didn't have to fan you anymore to drink it, but they couldn't afford for vote. Wow. Yeah. Old Movies, man, old movies will trip you out or other. There's a, there's a, the in the godfather, someone goes let's sell drugs in their neighborhood, their animals.

Speaker 3:          00:11:40       Anyway. And I remember seeing that and going like, that's a little rough like as an adult probably 20 going like maybe cut that out. Like Mooney always makes the joke that like the fact that they aired on television pretty irresponsible or is this sort of like fucked up Dave and introduced that idea that there's anybody that would listen to that guy and think he was making sense. It's dangerous. It's. Are you talking about Mooney or the guy? The Guy Saying that and the Godfather? Yeah, it's messy. If you're a little black child and you have to fucking listen to that now, do you think they should cgi, they should eat that gun out of all these movies. Do you think they should. CGI that did was create a work

Speaker 4:          00:12:23       for. And then work of art reflects a honest behavior, but when you put it on television, it's a very tricky thing and if you're going to hear that on tbs,

Speaker 3:          00:12:34       I wonder if they. I wonder if they, uh, if they, if it went in there is on television.

Speaker 4:          00:12:39       Well, I don't endorse them censoring it, but I don't get to see where people would not want their kids to be exposed to certain things that are in certain movies more than Jackson. If you could just flip through the channels, you know, it's easy to get to something.

Speaker 3:          00:12:52       What was the first moment you saw that you were like, oh, this isn't. This is an adult.

Speaker 4:          00:12:57       My parents took me to a drive in and there was some Kung Fu movie. I was a real little kid, but I remember my mom being pissed off.

Speaker 3:          00:13:04       I got to say, it doesn't surprise me. It doesn't frighten me. Like you little Joe Rogan and to come from like your parents get murdered. My parents were crazy, so and in the background your parents get murdered in your wife and the images of Kung Fu or fucking streaming and on your possible tyrants are going, Joe, you have to avenge us. And there was a girl who had a

Speaker 4:          00:13:24       in the movie, she had marks on her chest, like she got scratched and the guy said, let me see what it looks like. And so of course she pulls her whole top off and I just remember my mom saying this because I was like fucking four years old or something. But I remember her going. She didn't have to take her. Sure.

Speaker 3:          00:13:40       Dot that way, like she was mad at how preposterous it was. She didn't have to take her shirt off that there was another, there was another route. This is ridiculous. That was. Yeah, that was exploitative. She could've just, her being upset by that. And what did your dad go like? Well, let her finish. Jennifer, what was your mother? I think her real name is a Santa. Wasn't real. Yeah, but she didn't like it. So she went by the name of Susan. She and I have something in common because I don't like it either. A, what does that mean? I don't know. I don't know if. No idea. Some Italian name. It does sound like an Italian. A slang for blind people does it there, but I don't, I don't appreciate. There's got to be a lot of them. Uh, how many days a week do you guys do the show to? Most of the time. And you're doing a podcast now yourself? Yes, I am. I'm doing a podcast called, uh, the champs, uh, with me and Neal Brennan, Moshe Kasher, and I can't even dj doug pound who's from Tim and Eric. And uh, our angle is we have a, we only have black guests because black people are so underrepresented and podcasts each crazy.

Speaker 5:          00:14:52       Yeah, it's crazy, you know. But like, are you sure tyler was the only blind person? Women and black people just don't. It really is like, they're behind on, on podcasts in terms of popularity. It's a lot of white men like Joe Rogan. Um, and so this week we've had a comics, we had a jerrod Carmichael on who's really funny, young guy and you know, in words. And then this week we have Blake Griffin, the basketball player who is about as cool and funny a guy as you'll ever meet. Like you can't believe it. How cool and end. He's legitimately funny. Like we were texting one night I go, uh, he, he was going to vegas and I go, Hey, if you need, um, if you need a carrot top tickets, kill yourself. And he wrote back, actually I just found out that carrot top killed himself. And I, and I wrote back, oh, that's a shame.

Speaker 5:          00:15:46       Kind of put on one hell of a show. And Blake wrote back, flake wrote back, I give them props, but the fucking guy used them all, which is like, that's a pretty good joke for a 22 year old dunk champion. But that's maybe not even the best exit. He's just a really funny dude and incredibly nice. Like we had, um, we did a podcast in my house and he was drinking. He brought up, he had a bottle of water and then he, he finished that and then he refilled it in the, in the tap, in my kitchen sink was used to the locker room on it I guess. But it was just very like impressed by like, how are you not a Dick? I kept asking him, how are you known a Dick? And he never told me no, but he's like, he, yeah, he's, he's got one car, he rents his house.

Speaker 5:          00:16:35       Like he's just a smart. It's kind of an interesting situation with a lot of athletes is a lot of athletes that just did not nice people. It's like part of getting good at the sport means kind of. Well that's what we were talking about is being. And you could talk, we get, this would actually be an interesting thing because I would like to make a legit documentary about this competition in America, uh, in that. Because like coby Brian is too competitive. Michael Jordan is too competitive to the point where it's like, dude, I don't look like I'm all for winning. I'm all for. But you clearly are something is there's like a switch. And I was talking to another NBA player who's, who's a big star and I won't say his name [inaudible]. I go, I go man. And Colby is a, he's too competitive. And he's like, well, you know, man, it's this, you know, you get in the game. I go, he's too competitive. He is, I know. And tell them that all the time because like he, it's like sort of weird to people when you're, that how they get so good though.

Speaker 5:          00:17:40       Absolutely. Mike, Mike Koby Bryant, Michael Jordan, guys like that are Michael Jordan is an incredible athlete. And you pair that with this crazy spirit and you get Michael Jordan. But what I'm saying is at what point is it too much? Where it's like you deal with mma, I think about it in comedy, guys knocking each other out of the way. It's like, what are we getting at? Because all every study of human happiness, and particularly there's a lot of sociological studies coming out in the last five to 10 years say that people don't get any happier beyond a certain, a financial point. They don't get any happier, uh, with possessions. They don't, you know what I mean? So it's like, what are we, what's the point? It's also now it's like cap. This is the first time in my life where I've ever thought like, capitalism isn't so great. You know what I mean? Where it's finally falling apart, where you kind of go,

Speaker 1:          00:18:35       well, all right, let's see what happens. I think it's not perfect, but I think the idea of, you know, you're working your merit and your ability to maneuver your way through the system counts up to something. The more effort you put in, the more reward you get back. I agree with the idea of capitalism and that went. But when you, when you get involved in the system that we have now with, with some just the stock market alone, like, and trading. And what did you short on this article the other day? It was brilliant and he said, because I've had to tell people that, haven't read it. It was in the Sunday, New York Times. He basically more above it. The third wealthiest man in the world or America says, Richard said, fuck

Speaker 5:          00:19:16       he, whatever. He owns the company, a five products in your house. Um, he basically said, look, we, I weed people rich people like me have super rich, don't get taxed enough. We used to get tax way more. And I've had this argument, but you know, how Republicans thought, we say a tax cuts lead to an improvement in the economy. And I, in the back of my head, I've had this argument that a sacrament with Vince Vaughn one time about that people don't get into business if taxes on doing standup comedy. We're a 70 percent and not 40 percent. I would still do standup comedy. Do you know what I mean? I'm not doing it for a bit. I think people start their own business because they don't like working for other people and they, um, and they have an idea that they want to create by themselves and I don't think it comes down to I'm not going to do it because taxes are too high.

Speaker 5:          00:20:15       And Warren Buffett made that point that capital gains tax, meaning gay, uh, uh, taxes on money you make in profit on the stock market. Like if you make, if you invest 100 grand and then you make 15 grand off of it, uh, they will tax the 15 grand at. Now it's really low. It's like 11 percent if that. And Warren Buffet said it used to be 29 and he said, and everyone invested just as much. So I, I reject the idea that, that we all liked this, that taxes, that even socialism, I think you would do the exact same shit in a socialist country. I think you would, if they paid you to host fear factor and a podcast and news radio and all this shit. If you did the same, if you, if we all got paid relatively the same amount of money, I believe that I believe that I do what I do because I'm compelled to do it, not because of the money. Now I'm not saying everyone's an artist or everyone's a writer, a comedian or whatever, but I'm, I'm of the mind that, that people.

Speaker 6:          00:21:22       So you, uh, you're almost advocating everyone getting paid the same amount.

Speaker 5:          00:21:27       Uh, I don't. Here's what I'm advocating. I'm advocating that the, we live in a country where people, art, people die because they're poor and I think a lot of Republicans or right wing people think that, that the reason they're poor is because they didn't work hard enough. And that's simply not the case. A lot of times I think people, I think a lot of people on the right are born on third base and think they hit a triple. You're born into this career. You know what? That's an old phrase, but yet it's, it's, you're born into this life and then you go because you don't. It's like when Barbara Bush said during Katrina, Hurricane Katrina, she goes about the people in the superdome. She goes, some of those people have never lived so well. It's like you fucking cunt for you to say yes. She actually said that.

Speaker 5:          00:22:18       Um, so, so the idea that people will, they, they just believe that people in rich white people couldn't believe that there were people in America that didn't have cars when they said they would go, well, the mayor told them to get out of town and drive out into town and they're like, they didn't have cars and there were no buses. The buses stopped at a certain point. Um, so just the idea that people are dying. Uh, and then we get into this thing of like American's best isn't, uh, a lot. Most of the people that say America's best system in the world don't know what the other systems and also the idea of like socialized medicine.

Speaker 6:          00:22:54       Why wouldn't you want to help save people's lives like I, you know, I think the idea behind it is that it doesn't encourage competition amongst doctors, doctors. So doctors, if they're only going to get paid a certain amount of money, no matter what, they have no incentive to be excellent. But that goes back to my point. I think most people that are doctors are compelled to be Dr, but I don't think it's either or. You don't think that a doctor is compelled to be a doctor. He enjoys it, but works even harder because he gets financial compensation for his work. I think personally, I personally

Speaker 5:          00:23:29       don't because I think that people that are driven are not driven by a financial renew.

Speaker 6:          00:23:36       Right? But you don't think it enhances things is even if they're not driven by it, even if they would be doing it happily for a peasant's wage because they love the art, whatever the fuck they're doing,

Speaker 4:          00:23:46       you don't think that it makes them really push it and have it sometimes and not slack off when there's money on online? Uh, yes, I think, yeah, to give people money makes me have productive.

Speaker 5:          00:23:57       Uh, yes. But I guess the point is why are we so compelled to be productive? It's like where they go, they go, man, France fucking only works 35 hour work week and we get an image in our head of like,

Speaker 4:          00:24:11       that's faggy a 35 hour work week. What are you affect it? No, they're having a good life like we don't, but we've these systems and the images and the and the, the cultural norms are such an America that we just go with fucking. I wouldn't be caught dead only working 30 about why, why, why do you? Why? Why do we all have this need to like, I'm going to fucking work and I got to generate and I got to make fucking. I got to trick people into wanting to buy shit that I'm doing so that I can get money and then buy shit that I had been tricked into that I don't need. I don't need any of this. This is a song that I've been bouncing around forever and my conclusion and I don't have a real conclusion, but what I always believe is that it seems that everything in nature operates in some sort of a natural system that we accept.

Speaker 4:          00:24:59       Whether it's salmon going up river, there's bizarre things, you know, they're going up river and throwing themselves on the rocks and it happens every year. It's just a cycle and it's put in place for a reason. It's put in place to make sure that only bad motherfucker, salmon get to breed. You've got to be the baddest motherfucker to make it up that river. And I think that that is the same thing with human beings. I think we are a part of a natural system too, but we're the apex of the natural systems and we're so super complex that we don't even understand our motivations for things. We don't understand that this drive and this, you know, all our ideas of personal gain really aren't about personal gain. It's about enhancing the amount of money that goes into this system that makes things and innovate. It's. That's what it really is all about. It has nothing to do with you or I all of our wants and needs and loves for material possessions and all the things that comes with it. Those that all that is doing is somehow or another pushing innovation, pushing you. Keeping up with the Jones' is pushing some sort of a technological singularity that we're pushing towards said

Speaker 5:          00:26:01       that, do we not attended? We just let it is I guess on productivity as this, as this, as this high high. That's the ultimate goal. Just seems like no, it is ridiculous for the fucking people who own the company, but it's not. It's middle. Like the middle class is gone now because it's because we've all been tricked into thinking like, like these people that provide jobs are these fucking messiahs the particularly in the last year and a half of like, what about the jobs? What about the jobs so that they go, well, we don't want to hurt. We don't want to tax people like Warren Buffet because they provide jobs. Actually most jobs in America, I think 60 percent of America are from small businesses, um, now having. So I guess it's just the idea of in they're starting to study like a gross national happiness. Um, and I, and, and a lot of it is not contingent upon capitalism and productivity and I.

Speaker 5:          00:27:02       because now I feel like people are so drunk on productivity and getting these possessions that they are, have less time for the kids. They get to work two jobs, they got an. It just seems like it, it just seems like we're at a breaking point in terms of like, uh, I don't, I don't know if it'll happen, but I, I wish there was some amount of consideration from people. Uh, I, I, and having said that I enjoy a hard day's work. I enjoy like him. But what I like about it is I like the personal interaction. That's what I've always loved about work is the personal connection you have with people and like feeling like we're doing this thing together that I'm completely for, but it's, you know, it's like the money part I just find not negligible because I think it's important to make a living all that stuff. But, but I just feel like there's too much of a premium put on productivity and getting pregnant.

Speaker 1:          00:27:59       There are. But you know what? I love having an. I love having a laptop. I think it's awesome. I really liked being able to go buy a cellphone. I love it. I love being able to get a car. I'm not making any of these things and neither are you, right? You don't know to live this life this way. We need somebody to make shit and you know, no one's saying that should be, you know, I understand that, but

Speaker 5:          00:28:21       that doesn't necessarily preclude that. It couldn't have happened in another, in another financial system or arc or like as, as the guy on the Internet the other day said, a felonious monk is the guy's name, but he put up, posted a youtube video that got a lot of love. He said a black dude. He goes, how can you, how am I going to say that capitalism is the best system in the world when we owe billions of dollars to a communist country. You know what I mean? We just like [inaudible]. America is like, this is best. Okay, well, why don't we eat. Their system is clearly beating as a communist. Uh, they're there. It's like a communist with a soft capitalism. I don't even know how you described the Chinese Chinese a financial.

Speaker 1:          00:29:03       I don't know enough about our financial system to even comment on it and when I say things I'm usually wrong as far as like numbers and. No, I'm, I'm. That's the thing about all this shit is no one under all the fucking. They don't know. They know that. That fucking. What's his name guy? The ponzi scheme guy. What's his name? Bernie madoff already made off. It would never been able to get away with that if they all knew that that is the best proof of this is some crazy fucking get. So when people go, when people go, well, I don't think that we should have done the bailout and why don't think it's like, yeah.

Speaker 5:          00:29:37       In a perfect world, Matt Taibbi wrote a book called Grip Toby, which is fucking excellent book. I love that dude. A. The book is really, really good. I love the rolling stone articles. He was the guy who. He broke the Goldman Sachs article because he was on. How is he still alive? I know. Well, that's proof that there is no illuminati. If you needed any more for, but that's the only shred of proof, that mentality. There's a lot. Um, the, uh, the he was on, he was in the press pool on I believe Obama's or Mccain's campaign for president and they were all talking about the, you know, the bailout and the all that, this, the tarp and all that shit. And he was with all the correspondence and he goes, does any, do any of us know what top is? And none of them did. And he was like, I have to study, I have to write about this shit because we're the ones who are supposed to know and we don't fucking know. And he said, and he said, the amount of work it takes to even understand it. He's like, it was, it was, it was pitifully boring, uh, how much shit he had to do to even begin to understand it. And his point about tea party people was, they, what they long for is simplicity. And that shit is over some financials.

Speaker 6:          00:30:57       It's not just financial simplicity, but I think the whole idea of calling themselves the tea party, I mean they, they, they are actually, they're reinvigorating memories of the original Boston Tea Party. No, absolutely. But, but having said that,

Speaker 5:          00:31:10       it wasn't. The Boston tea party was about taxation without representation and this is about complex financial instruments and the interconnectivity of the global financial system. It's like you can't, they don't know what a fucking uh, uh, reverse mortgage, all that shit

Speaker 6:          00:31:30       that you just go. I don't know what the fuck. I don't know. I'm a relatively intelligent guy. I have and my dad was a tax attorney. I don't understand any of this shit. And you try to look at like leveraged mortgage and shorting. Yeah. You look at talent. Try to figure that out. I, yeah. Shorting. I could explain relatively [inaudible] like, but, but the, uh, what about that dude that shorted the economy that there was some, some gigantic wage have made that the economy that are American economy's going to lose its AAA standard or whatever it be making millions of dollars. Yeah. Some guy made a fuckload of money when our credit rating dropped. Yeah, that is correct. But again, you wouldn't even try to explain that to somebody in the tea party. Try to explain that to a fucking intelligent person. Try. Explain. So anyway, so yeah, so, so they're trying to. So

Speaker 5:          00:32:22       they're trying to, uh, they long for this simplicity of like, I don't, I believe that there should you believe in, in corporate socialism, but you're like, fuck you if you're dying. But if a corporation is even as like a, a graze, like a flesh wound here comes everyone to like, we got to help the corporations because they provide jobs like you motherfuckers are buying into this thing of it's the deification of corporations.

Speaker 1:          00:32:49       Well, if you ever watched that documentary, the corporation. No. Yeah, that's an amazing piece of work. It really gets you thinking of how the. It's actually set up and the way it's set up. No one feels like they're doing anything badly even though bad things are getting done

Speaker 5:          00:33:03       it. You can't be a corporation without being fucking dastardly. You eat. You have to, the way the system instead of, and this goes back to my, my, uh, my capitalism argument, the way the system is set up, if these corporations profits don't increase every 12 weeks, their stock price goes down. So how do you make profits increase? Either fucking expand your market or cut workers, so. So they cut orders is a fucked up thing to do and expanding markets is a pretty dastardly business to uh, so. So they're not the only way you survive in these. I remember when me and a Chappelle, we're having stuff with, with comedy central, a lot of stuff and I go get that. That's not their viacom for a reason. Like they're just, that's what they fucking, they who, how can we get there? They're hungry machines that are built to hoard money and fuck people over.

Speaker 1:          00:34:05       Well, when you get into negotiations with anyone about anything and you start really realizing, oh yeah, this is where it is. How was your a fear factor? Negotiation was. It wasn't gross. It was easy. It was easy. There were nice, great. Well luckily I did it for 148 episodes, so they knew I could do it. I didn't know I was going to have to audition for it and I was like, you better not make me audition for our jobs. Stupid. They were always kind of weird with that show because it did so good. Like I think it stayed on NBC website the whole time. It was off the air. Like you could still go to the show page for fear factor and it was kind of odd. That was the only show that you could do that with? Well, I don't think it was ever officially cancel and I think we just stopped production. Who was weird because it never liked. Got horrible ratings. They all die off a little bit, but it never had. It never was horrible. It was just. We had done a syndicated version. Are you guys 148 was enough to syndicate. Oh, it was 100 more than enough syndicates. They syndicates most shows at 100.

Speaker 5:          00:35:04       No, absolutely. But I'm saying did you. But it's like a who wants to be a millionaire? Like they, they, they, they stripped it, stopped doing it prime time and then they did they ever.

Speaker 1:          00:35:13       No, no, no, I didn't do that. Well that would be the budget of fear factor is really high when you factor in some of the crazy fucking stents these people have to do and they're big this year, man. There's some nutty shit. These fucking people have to do like some real real like were you like, whoa. Like this is fucking scary. Let's. This one's nuts. I can't describe any of them. It would be a, it'd be a breach contract, but it's

Speaker 6:          00:35:38       bigger. Like the stents are bigger and crazier than we've ever done it before.

Speaker 3:          00:35:41       You were ahead of your time jail by the way. I wanted to say that you never wear makeup on any time you go on TV shows or if you're on shows and stuff like that. He's always been the person where they have to make a person come and just like, no, I don't want any. And they're like, well we're just going to give it up. No, I don't want any. You never get. I was watching a show the other day though, where you can now with the hd, you could see the makeup, the bad makeup jobs on all these people, and now I'm just imagining you with rosy cheeks.

Speaker 6:          00:36:05       Yeah. You had a skin thing though, didn't you have the little Lego? You can see it on my knuckles. You had it on your face that would periods correct. Yeah, but it goes away. There's a stuff called protopic ointment as long as you catch it, like right as it's coming out, you can get it to go away, but you've got to be real diligent about your vitamins and stuff like that and wouldn't really shows. It was like when I'm out in the sun, you know, got it. Really shows them a speaking of vitamins that wanted to talk about last time we were here, we were talking about a hgh, all that stuff. Um, and a buddy of mine texted me and said, [inaudible], you were saying that there's basically no side effects, etc. Not say there's no sound. It's relatively safe if you're doiNg it under a doctor's supervision.

Speaker 6:          00:36:44       Right. You're smart about it. Uh, and my buddy texted me and said, uh, what about, what about like cancerous cells? It will accelerate the growth of any kind of self. There's no evidence, there's no evidence that it supports cancer growth, but there is evidence that if your body's immune system's down and you're not healthy than cancer can grow in your bodies easier, right? If you have your overall system is operating more efficiently because of hormones that you've introduced to it or because of vitamins and supplements, if your system is working better, you're going to be able to fight things off better. It's really that simple. If you take a holistic approach to the human body, you know, cancer is a very, very, uh, tricky mystery of the human body as to why it exists in the first place. But a lot of people believe that anything, any ailment that at least part of it has to do with how you feel, what kind of energy you have, how much work you have to put in every day. How happy are you? And the idea is how much does the whole system are you? How much money did you make last quarter? That doesn't protect you from cancer fella. Wait, what? But that's what they would have. You believe that if you're. Who are these day, I believe the exist in that world needed to be an artist. This is crazy. It's like rejecting yourself in the proletariat to know. But I see people. nobody's more proletariat. Then the kid, the kid proletarian and he calls himself the kid. I liked to hang out with that guy.

Speaker 5:          00:38:12       The, uh, the, uh, I just think it's fucking disgusting. I think when people are, again, it goes back to that you can be anything in this country. You can be anything in this country. And they, it's never. You never hear it from when people go, yeah, you can be in this country. Having said that, if you're white, if you're born into a, into a upper middle class white people or above, it's way easier to be anything which they never said.

Speaker 4:          00:38:39       What's an unknown saying? It's a level playing field and it's impossible to make it level.

Speaker 5:          00:38:43       They'Re is. I agree, but they're implying that it's level. I think that the people on the upper crust believed that it's level goes bY,

Speaker 4:          00:38:52       did anybody believes it's level, but I do think that they think it's a better setup than India. That's what I think. I think they believe that people here have more of a shot at living a real life than France. You know, there's people that have these ideals,

Speaker 5:          00:39:05       but you know what America is ranked in terms of class a jumping in the world. 14th. Yeah. Who's the number one who just fucking around eight might be India. Really? Yeah. It's, it's, it's definitely not. Um, it's, I don't think it's the uk. I don't think. I think or it might be Germany, Germany has got a really good economy but, but uh, in terms of like the german, he was in the shitter right now to now they're the only ones that's not really not. Yeah, they've done better than anybody.

Speaker 4:          00:39:36       Some reason when we were over in Germany doing a show, that's what our driver was saying. Maybe he was just a whiner.

Speaker 5:          00:39:43       Uh, yeah. No. So, so the idea that America is the best you can jump. It's like, yeah, first of all, it's 14th in the world out of $200, which again is we made good, but in terms of if you ask people, they'd all go, we're number one.

Speaker 4:          00:39:56       Yeah. You know why we're number one? Because we had leonard's cantered. We make muscle cars. We have some of the fucking best shit. We designed some of the best shit. We invent some of the best shit. Fucking van halen. There's a reason why we have the best comedians. There's a reason why that's a fact. Even though there's some good ones from other countries, that's a fact.

Speaker 5:          00:40:15       Give us number one on shit that we deserve, that we're actually number one on, but we're not number when people are. You can be anything. There's of.

Speaker 4:          00:40:21       We don't have all the best bands, but we got most of them. Let's be realistic.

Speaker 5:          00:40:26       Uh, yeah. Joe, you make a really good point. We do have most of them.

Speaker 4:          00:40:29       America. I'm ted nugent concert. The other night on tv who was there had it on hd net. I have this crazy thing with ted nugent, man to new [inaudible], one of my favorite people to watch. You know, how come? Well, because he's. Well, first of all, he's super right wing rah rah guns kill american bison. He dodged the draft in Vietnam and if you listen to some of the stories that he told, I don't know if it's true, but by shitting himself and by doing crystal meth and getting his heart rate up and then showing up, I don't know which of those stories are true and you know, but this guy dodged the draft and yet he's this crazy like super pro military. God bless our war. Yes, god bless you warriors. And he's got a camo vest on and he's playing guitar and looking to god made some bad ass tunes mean no matter what you say about his politics, stranglehold is a fucking jam. You know that, that song, man, that's a bad ass. That's one of my favorite all time songs. He played the fucking shit out of a guitar, right? Yeah, fine with ted nugent can play the fucking shit out of a guitar. But god damn, he's so crazy with this pro warrior stuff and salute the warriors. It's, it's, it's

Speaker 5:          00:41:42       first of all, it's a pretty easy, you know what I mean? It's like pretty low hanging fruit to be like, I'm support the troops.

Speaker 4:          00:41:49       It's so silly and it's, it's almost like he's positioning himself to be a cheerleader. You know, I'm your guy and you're going to cheerlead a guarantee. You're not going to get another. But pro-america enemy. You know what I mean? Yeah. Even controversial doled ted's controversial, but you know exactly what it's marketing. Yeah, it's fucking fascinating is what it is.

Speaker 5:          00:42:08       Uh, somebody, um, when, when, when they swift voted for john kerry, bill clinton had the best point, which is the minute they swift boated them when they said he didn't, he wasn't a hero, isn't all that stuff. he should have challenged dick cheney and George Bush to a debate about Vietnam and he would've won the election like that. Um,

Speaker 4:          00:42:29       I think the way he laid down after that was all over. It was almost like he's not really wanting to be president in the first place.

Speaker 5:          00:42:37       Uh, he, he's, he's a, he's a, he's, he's soft. Yeah. Again, that's one of those things. It's like, I feel like democrats, if they have a shitty candidate will kind of admit it. I'd be like, eh, no. I feel like republicans kind of did with mccain where they were like, yeah,

Speaker 4:          00:42:53       when, so far as to get sarah pailin to join them. That's how little they believed in him. Yeah, exactly. Wanted to do a little bit the trick. They wanted to go to the party favor. Yeah. Yeah. Then now this, this michelle barre.

Speaker 5:          00:43:05       When things fucking. What are you, I understand you want to be in charge. I know you want to win. That's where this winning thing comes again. You want to win, but at what cost do you really think she's good at being charged or something?

Speaker 4:          00:43:20       Here's the real question. Why did this country become like this? Why are other countries more relaxed wise like Italy the way it is, why

Speaker 5:          00:43:30       Italy is really disorganized? There are, I mean in terms of what are you talking about?

Speaker 4:          00:43:34       I mean about the people, about people, their behavior, what they accept and what they don't accept, why they're driven and whether or not driven

Speaker 5:          00:43:40       well that that's an I, I, people come here. I mean, I think that originally people came to America to escape. I always call us like not england, whatever angle is like they don't have guns. Well we fucking have nothing but guns like, like, uh, they, they, the, the character of America is a, it is this kind of outlaw thing. It's certainly become this outlaw thing and it has become. We make best fucking cars and we got the data. It's just constant. Nobody believes we make the best car. Whatever you were saying where you're like, we need to make muscle cars. Vented muslim, but queers. Yeah. If you asked a bunch of people in the south and the north west, if they will go, yeah, fucking America does. It's all that stuff of we're the best. You don't really hear it in other countries. You hear like, this is a nice

Speaker 6:          00:44:37       country, but you don't go. We're the best in the world. Are so polite about it. They're like, canadians are doing good down. There are apps. Yeah. They caught a lot of canadian comedians in the american character. I don't think it has

Speaker 5:          00:44:52       to do with the old west. It's like the last, uh, it's kind of the last land that was settled in the world was the west.

Speaker 6:          00:45:01       So it's just wild douche bags,

Speaker 5:          00:45:04       dia that we are, it's a great question. It's one of those guns, germs and steel steel things where you just go, I don't really know why we are where we are. I always think australian dudes are a little rough because of the prison thing. That's why there's so many, uh, australian like leading men because they're like, fucking still dudes over there. Um, whereas, uh, he had the american character. I, I don't, I don't know. But, but I know that were a little soft. Right? I know I put, I don't think we're soft, I think, well in terms of that, but I'm saying the american character in terms of like we're the best, uh, we're, we're, we never fucking lose nothing. We withdraw.

Speaker 6:          00:45:47       We don't have a hero right now. Do we have an action hero semester stallone to 70 fucking years old? He's still beating people up. Oh yeah. No, like the rocks. Not really much of an action hero because he is. He's legit, but he's not. He's not legit. Like stallone was. No, not yet. No, but it's not going to happen. Well, the thing about stallone, stallone was legit as an actor first. Like with rocky, he was legitimate and an actor. He was respected. Then he went on commercial as commercial as you can get like many, many times that he started out as that legit guy. But in terms of action stars, I mean I feel like you had said like the new guy's going to be like a hardy christian bale. Christian bale I guess is kind of different action star, but it's the same way. Yeah. No. If there's none of that 80,

Speaker 5:          00:46:43       it's morning in America. That shit, like all that that's over. And now it's just this like it's America to me is defined at this point by dislike. Vicious infighTing between left and right and everyone's got their own little own little bunker and fuck them and everyone's got in the audience. Everyone's got their own little feedback loop of like people. I go on the huffington post and the daily beast. I would never go on fox news. I would never. I actually tweeted a couple of weeks ago, uh, which news do you guys root for fox or cnn? Because that's what it's come to. It's come down to these teams of like, I like that news. Yeah, it is a while. Meanwhile it's, it ought to be facts. You know what I mean? Now it's come down to this like, tell me the facts that favor my ego telling me that, spin this, so that. So that my worldview is confirmed.

Speaker 4:          00:47:38       It is amazing and we've allowed entertainment to enter into the news because that is exactly what it is. Editorial and entertainment. Yeah. No, when you, whenever you see some fucking guy and he gets busted doing something creepy sexually and he's like a senator. Fox news will always put democrat and second, doesn't matter if that guy's a republican, they'll put democrat and then they correct it, but the thing is, the most important thing is that the first inclination, the first image was another pervert democrat.

Speaker 5:          00:48:11       Right. That's illegal, man. You guys are criminals. But if the fucking sending the news, you're a propaganda machine. They are very probably supposed to be protected from that. Well, but they, they, they, that's all. That's all gone. This is the protection from that dude, the internet. I agree. Dude. Since doing this, doing your pockets. The first one, I don't know, it was six weeks ago or something. I really see the value of the. It's just so democratic. It's fucking fair. Because I went on the road and I had people showing up from twitter and I was getting like the. I was getting a bunch of money at the door, like I was getting a percentage of the door instead of this thing of like, yeah, we'll give you 1500 for the weekend and then you maybe if you make the bonus, which you never going to make, and then I can do one show, tweet it out and get a grant, you know what I mean? Get like a fair wage for, for the skill and the, a popularity instead of them going like, you know, you're not popular, you're going, but I have 80,000 people on twitter who sam popular come to the show and yet you're telling me. So. So that's what's great about the internet is, is it, is really fair. And, and uh, and I didn't even realize the sort of power of it. you were quick to. It wasn't because of your worldview or was it because, uh, because you just happened to, you lucked into it.

Speaker 4:          00:49:40       Well, I've been pretty deeply embedded into the internet since 1998. I had a message board on my website and so from 1998 I would write blogs and interact with people on my message board and I think in 2001 we switched it over to a vbulletin and now it's kinda like $5 million posts on it. yeah, it's got. I mean I don't know how many thousands of members, but it's super active and people are constantly posting on a regular basis and there's a. There's great value in connecting with people online. The biggest resource in human history for gathering information, for being introduced to new information is this. Nothing is like twitter has ever existed before. Every fucking day someone's sending someone. I don't know who's sending me some cool link yesterday. It was some fucking

Speaker 1:          00:50:28       crazy video where these dudes took a hornet and they threw it into a spider's nest to see who would win the horn of the spider. It was fucking bad ass man. That marvel, but the right. That spider just fucks that hornet up. Spoiler alert, spoiler alert. It's worth seeing again though, even if I have spider, spider, jack's the hornet and so no, no comparison long was the fight. That was very quick. Hugh sackett, did you give it a van? A mma announcing? No, I didn't. No commentary. I did a. I did a lot of this fuck by myself. You know when you by yourself going, fuck, we just lucky spiders are little man. could you imagine if a spider the size of your house? Man, you have translators out here. I didn't even know there was translated in California. Huge dead translate on. It's killed once, one accidentally.

Speaker 1:          00:51:17       I didn't realize I'd killed until I stepped on it. It was in front of my house. It was like my fucking hand was my hand. I'm not joking. It was my guy, harry harry fucking crab. It was a crab walking around. I really didn't realize how big it was. I stepped on it and it crunched and then I went back inside the house and got a flashlight and came outside and looked at. Giant was so big. It almost seemed like a pet that got loose. Doesn't that freak you out that when you lay in your bed that some spiders that could crawl from the host of fear factor. Okay. Everything can be probably somewhere. I've seen everything creepy crawly on this planet. On your few. Can't throw me. Yeah, the dude, eddie bravo went to Costa Rica once and he told me how horrifying it was laying in this place because it was like an open air cabana and that's how they kind of kept at cooley were above the ocean and above the wall there was like a gap between the ceiling and the wall.

Speaker 1:          00:52:10       Whereas just air comes in and fucking bugs and he said did well like birds. These birds size bugs flying around the fucking room. Yeah. That, that kind of shit freaks me out, but this isn't that bad. Every now and then you got to kill a snake. Based on that. You were talking about a snake the other day. He killed a rattlesnake the other day and then there was transistor. You're time I fuck rattle snakes and people say you shouldn't do that. And because I've got kids and rattlesnakes can go fuck themselves. Yeah. If I can, and I have dogs, my I've had when I had pit bulls, both my dogs had to bring them to the hospital on two separate occasions for rattlesnake bites. Oh my god. Yeah, yeah. No, no joke. Dude. You're a fucking vigilante. I went running ones with the dogs. I ran over this rattlesnake and I didn't realize I had run over it until I was in the air, in between paces.

Speaker 1:          00:53:00       I thought it was a log. I thought it was a big ass fucking branch. I mean it was big, you know, because I'm running with the pitbulls and I have to keep up with them and I'm taking the turn and as I take the term, we'd go over. They didn't notice it either. Thank god, because it was totally outstretched. They go over it. I go over and then I stop and turn. I pulled him over, I get 'em on the leashes and I start pulling up to the thing and it's like my forearm dude. It's enormous. Big fucking

Speaker 4:          00:53:26       rad norm. It's like your forearm. My form for a snake is huge for a guy. It's not too small. It's not that bad, it's not embarrassing, but these fucking snake was huge dude. It was like it had to be eight feet long.

Speaker 5:          00:53:42       You didn't kill it and you just.

Speaker 4:          00:53:44       I try to kill it, but yeah, I try to tie the dogs up your website very quickly. My website I've been doing since [inaudible] 98. And what, who do you think

Speaker 5:          00:53:53       is who is like if you had one, if you. If there was like the joe rogan fan, can you describe him or her? To me? No, there's what do they all have? What's the commonalIty? Is there anything?

Speaker 4:          00:54:08       No, I don't think so. No. There's a lot of right wing guys on my message board and a lot of like really hippie guys and you know, I can say there's, there's no, you know, there's people that appreciate someone who's going to tell you the truth is going to be people that know that I've been involved in controversial shit from the beginning of my career. I don't. I think that if you can express yourself as long as you can, let people know how you feel about things you should, you should do. What the fuck are you like? You should do what you want and not worry about others.

Speaker 5:          00:54:39       That's what I love about twitter is you just say something like, fuck you, and you just go, yeah, no, I'm not taking it down. This is what I. like I said, it's the George Bush thing and just go like he, George Bush never made a mistake because. yeah, well that's what I mean. Like some people go when, when, when we killed in london, it's like, or gets killed or whatever you want to say it in people's heads. I think they get that credit. Bush somehow.

Speaker 4:          00:55:00       If there's one constant in all the people that I do meet, is that there? Surprisingly nice and I get this from comedy club waitresses. They're always saying that when we do theaters, people always say that like, your fans are so nice. They're you guys. That's what, if there's anything I try to put out, are they put up like underdogs? I guess everyone's maybe in this world if you're not a fucking ceo, you're an underdog. Yeah, I mean, yeah. If what you said about corporations is true and it is the, yeah, we're all underdogs and we're all in this together and I think if there's anything they share is that there's a lot of fucking nice people that come to my shows and people that are just trying to have some fun man and people that respect someone who's going to say what they really think.

Speaker 5:          00:55:44       Yeah. That's the other thing politically, that they've been learning. Studies have elections. They people vote for people with the courage of their convictions. That's why they go. He's a flip flopper. Everyone's like, fuck this guy. Wait. He takes into consideration facts and changes his opinion. That fucking fuck this guy because he just needs you to be like this pillar. That's George Bush was a pillar of, I believe stupidity, but he wasn't. He didn't move.

Speaker 4:          00:56:14       Yeah. They also have everybody convinced that if you do flip flop and get caught, you're done. Instead of someone coming up and saying, yeah, in

Speaker 5:          00:56:22       some ways you done because

Speaker 1:          00:56:24       they go, this guy's soft. This guy's a flip flopper. People respond to the courage of your convictions. I told a story the other night, uh, at our, I did a show with ari. I'm in montreal. It was, we were telling stories and I told a sex story that, that, uh, I was dating two girls at the same time, which I didn't like. I don't like doing that because I told them was variety. Well, no, no, no, no, not my problem is when you date more than one girl, you get the stories mixed up. Oh yeah. He

Speaker 5:          00:56:59       died in nine slash 11. My mistake. Um, so, uh, so, uh, so I was dating two girls. One came over thursday night. She had very short hair then and she gave me oral sex. friday night, a long haired girl come over. She, she don't come over and we had regular sex. A saturday night, the short haired girl comes back, we have oral sex again. I go to the bathroom, she comes out and goes, hey neil, if you're going to sleep with other girls, uh, be a little more clever about it. And I was like, what are you talking about? She goes, I just found a hairband and economy behind your bed. Now I'm basically cold, busted and uh, and I took a pause, like a really. And she goes, yeah, and I go, man, what has been going on in here? And just walked out of the room and she was fine with it. What's because I just sold you just go. That's crazy. And just

Speaker 1:          00:57:59       eddie murray used to do a joke about it where it's like just denied. Denied. Denied. Denied. Denied. Yeah. But that's better than denying instead of denying you're incredulous. You can't believe this is going down. That's better than denying who you reacted perfectly. If you denied it, you'd have probably been busted. Yeah. But instead of denying it, you like, you didn't even consider it as a possibility that you could have been. He's been doing. Yeah. You were like, what the fuck is this? I got to talk to them

Speaker 5:          00:58:23       manager or something? Yeah. You must have a clean underneath bed though. I never clean underneath my bed. So even if a girl came underneath my bed, she'd be like, oh my god, there's $500 bucks. Somebody taught me a long time ago. If you're dating more than one girl, you gotta, you gotta have a lint brush. That's the key. when pro, because they girls shared a lot of hair and earrings. You gotta scoop earrings out. You got to have a lint brush. You really gotta be on top of it. You're getting variety. Jail. Yeah, but you're also. There's a lotta, there's a lot of. There's. Look, people don't think about it from the guy's point of view. Who's, who has to date three different women. They don't. They only see it if you're a dog. Yes. but do you have any idea of the stress? I'm under that. I'm constantly having a lint brush things and fucking collect the earrings and, and um, socks. People. Don't.

Speaker 1:          00:59:14       People feel bad for you, dude. You should be able to cheat and not get fucked with you. Fucking these broads. Got to get off my back. What

Speaker 4:          00:59:22       do you think about people that want to live a, a polyamorous life and just continue that forever? Like the idea that we should never be committed to one person and we all should stop being so jealous about what, what our loved ones do with their bodies and just go and have a wild.

Speaker 5:          00:59:37       It seems crazy. It's a great idea. In theory, I think it's good cause I like I have a. I had a girlfriend and then we broke up and now it seems as if we're going to. We're headed back to togetherness. Oh shit. I'm. Hi. I'm and I'm and, and we were talking about it yesterday actually. That is my problem with relationships is you have to make an emotional promise in the future. So I have to go. I'm going to love you 10 years from now. Meanwhile, I've changed so much in three years. the fact that I'm making fucking emotional promises. It's crazy. I hope I love you. I hope I love you, but the idea of going like, I guarantee you I love you and if I can't then you get half of my shit. I bet you that I'm going to love you. I'll bet you half my shit that I'm going to

Speaker 4:          01:00:32       relationships make sense to me. Of course marrIage doesn't make sense to me. Less kids are involved and even then I only got married because of my wife. I wanted her to be happy and I wasn't going anywhere. I'm committed to the whole thing and raising children all requires this level of commitment and that and I'm more than willing to embrace it. The only reason why I was willing to do it legally and sign all that stuff, I was like, this is like, this is some crazy stupid tradition. It's completely ridiculous. Then sayIng you should have to break up and you have to bring in the legal system. So to do it without children to me seems preposterous. To do it with children is ridiculous, but I submitted to it but to do it just because you're in love like my god, you're crazy. You're connecting yourself with someone legally and

Speaker 6:          01:01:17       well. Do you really fucking know them? You don't. I mean it's fucking. You don't specify things are going great. Yeah. When your life is going great and everything's going great, you you barely know people. You know them. When some shit hits the fan, it's easy to. It's easy to know somebody when you're in fucking. You're both in love with each. Exactly what's the. Especially in the beginning because every little annoyances like,

Speaker 5:          01:01:37       no, that's a little thing, and then it metastasizes and it's three and a half years later and you're like, ooh,

Speaker 6:          01:01:43       and also you might be evolving and them not advice averse. You know

Speaker 5:          01:01:49       how you've evolved as a person. You almost are saying when you're in, if you're going into this relationship like I'm done revolving when I know the way I feel about this and you is never going to change. It's like it just. It seems like a state basis

Speaker 4:          01:02:06       when you could. You could get involved with the chicken. Then she can turn vegan on you and then you're in the middle of the relationship and all of a sudden they're giving you shit about eating cheeseburgers.

Speaker 6:          01:02:14       definitely. Oh fuck that woman. Have you well know I'm people think

Speaker 5:          01:02:20       I am vegan. I didn't do. I was single when I never do it in. Why not the that? Because the meat industry is fucking disgusting. Like the amount of greenhouse gases, cows and mitch shit like that. Like they're worse than cars and I'm not that big of mika. I just wasn't, you know.

Speaker 1:          01:02:38       Here's the problem with that statement. Go. Cows are awesome and so are cars. So we've got a problem. Cool. We've got a problem because I enjoy. You testified before congress. Uh, I will call me. That'd be. I will have that testimony and if I do testify before congress, you can guarantee 100 percent. I will be high on marijuana are usually. Well, whatever testifying.

Speaker 5:          01:03:01       Did the fear factor people get get on you about being, talking about being high end.

Speaker 1:          01:03:05       One of the producers sent me a text message when we had signed the deal saying breakout the pot lollipops because it was a, was an inside joke. I would take the pot lollipop every day at work. Right. That's how I enjoyed the show. I enjoyed doing it. When I was stoned. I would come in, if I wasn't stone, I would think about all the shit that I could be doing at home. I could be playing pool with one of my friends. I could go to jujitsu class, I, I'll do all these things that I, that I would like to do today and write some jokes instead of being out here in some fucking rock quarry with six different knuckleheads that want to be famous on tv, but then out of that pot lollipop and now it's soaking the full experience and then all of a sudden I'm like a fucking scientist. Then all of a sudden I'm studying human behavior and taking it all in house and cars and thinking about new orleans between the sun and the earth and how this is fear keeps the heat in and it is that. If it just shifts a little bit, we freeze to death. That's the. Did you. Did you tell your back on a lot of cops? Oh yeah. Yeah, right away. Great. There's no way to do it. Other than that, I wouldn't disrespect people that enjoy the original show by trying to do it sober.

Speaker 1:          01:04:15       One hundred 48 episodes. Don't out of my fucking mind the integrity of that, but listen, it's medical marijuana. What I'm doing is legal in the state of California. I'm a. I'm a voter

Speaker 5:          01:04:26       I that had told me to ask you about something that's like, it's, it's the chemical that gets released when you die, but you can eat it or smoke it or something around the dmt not. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:04:38       Yeah. Oh, sorry. Sorry. I've talked to about it so many times or something like google it. They'll give you a documentary to watch. Can you get me any? No, I can't because it's illegal. You fucking retard. You mean like lollipops, you know? I mean like dimethyl tree. Domestic trip to me is like really, really illegal. Like it's not like a slap on the wrist sort of thing. Having a nuclear weapon in your house or something. Is that true? It's scheduled one, but so is weed, but weed is elise has admitted it may. Even the government has admitted has certain medical properties to it. There's, you know, it's very hard, very hard pressed to come up with medical properties for

Speaker 4:          01:05:18       dmt. The problem is dmt exists in many different plants, not just one and all the plants that it exists in our legal right, so you can actually have a plant that contains dmt in it and it's not like having a marijuana plant which contains thc. The dmt plant would not be illegal. It would only be illegal if you extracted it, went into the plant and took this stuff out. But the problem is also exists in your, your, your own body. It's like terence mckenna joke. Everybody's holding when it comes to the you, you're all, you're all legal. You know, you're all. Y'all have it. Isn't hgh illegal? You'll have different synthesize with bacteria. I mean they make it something that they make in a laboratory. It's different,

Speaker 6:          01:05:55       but I'm saying it's not mobile dentical I don't know. No, no. You can get it prescribed. It's prescribed it for a bunch of different things. For recurring. It's healthy. It's healthy for your body, you know? I mean, I'm not saying all levels of it are healthy, but for people that have injuries per month because I want really want to know. Well, we'll sit down. I'll talk to, you know. I know, But I want to. I don't want to wait. I want to know the information. Okay, well I'll do that some other time. Maybe you didn't fuck in the army knew you should've gotten high with us before the show. Neil. Neil brennan is not high on marijuana and brian and our need some in your life. Brown settled. Yeah, I do drink. Not really. It'll put you in a good place. How can we take the weed?

Speaker 6:          01:06:37       Because it just makes me sleepy. But you get in the wrong lead. My does not make you sleepy. It makes you think about space. Yeah. No, I do want to do the uh, the, the, the chamber. You should do it then the fuck you want to do it? Well, who's holding you back? If you want to do it, why haven't you done it yet? You're one of those guys. You have fox something. There's a force. A lot of people are scared, man, scared of themselves. Uh, I, yeah. I feel like I know my foot pretty well.

Speaker 4:          01:07:00       That tank is you buddy. If you know yourself, you've got to get to know yourself much better. Tank is, especially if you're high. The scariest most self soul searching moments I've ever had is alone in that tank. On a pot. Brownie. yeah. Because the marijuana, when you, when you eat it, especially anything that's fucking with you, anything that's in your head that you're not happy with, just gets exposed. You know, that's the beauty of that tank. It's just like a, it's just the, like the best show for you to see. That is your life. That is like, here. Here is you. This is you. We're going to put on a show and we're going to show you. We're going to do a documentary on your life.

Speaker 6:          01:07:38       What changes did you make every result of? I'm not talking about outlook. I'm talking about talking about behavior from the tank. Yeah. I think it slow.

Speaker 4:          01:07:51       Slowly but surely made me a nicer person. For sure. Yeah. Yeah. Made me more humble. I think all the psychedelic experiences make you humble. They're all very humbling because they're very ego dissolving and there you know, you, you feel like you're connected with everything and when you come back you're like, wow, just knowing that that experience exists,

Speaker 6:          01:08:12       you've heard that you've sought study where people that did shrooms, like adult

Speaker 5:          01:08:16       did it, like conservative adults and I think seven of them, seven out of 10 said it was one of the best spiritual experiences of their life and they do it again.

Speaker 1:          01:08:27       It's beautiful. Yeah, no, I agree. I would encourage them. I've always said I would encourage my kids to do sharp. You know, it's all about set and setting. People have taken them in party ideas, you know, in a party saying and you know, had a bad time. Maybe they got too high. It had a bad trip. It's all what it's going to take you on a journey and you have to submit to the journey and you also have to be willing to go for a ride. Man, you can't try to resist it if you try to resist it and hold it back or deny the things that it's exposing. That's what a bad trip was all about, you know, that's the epitome of a bad trip. I also think there's people that just shouldn't ever do it ever though. Absolutely. Like duncan saying yesterday that he wanted to not dose whatever large amounts of people, you know, he was talking about. It's a really brilliant idea in injecting it into the common cold, injecting lsd into the common cold. So somehow when you got the common cold, you also want in his vast lsd trip. Wow. That is brilliant. Yeah. Until you get some kid that has, you know, a whatever, some kind of alzheimer's or not alzheimer's, but uh, autism. And then he fucks him. Yeah. And then he goes out and shoots up

Speaker 4:          01:09:36       a genius idea though. The idea of spreading something psychoactive through a cold. Like I wonder if that's possible, like just the idea of a cold. To me it's so bizarre, the idea that there's some invading organism that tries to shut your body down and consuming. You have to battle it with your immune system, but the fact that maybe this invading army, my kerrick psychedelic chemicals, why not?

Speaker 5:          01:09:57       It's where the capital thing comes in again because capitalism, cause they, they, it's, they spend more money on boner pills and then they do on solving the common cold because there's just more money and vulnerable probably aids research than, than boner pills. And it's like because there's just more money and it's like, yeah, but you're going to do more good. What do you inherent good.

Speaker 4:          01:10:16       What do you think about the people that don't believe that hiv causes aids? Have you ever heard of this argument? Does, what the fuck is the guys? And there's one doctor that's like a very well respected doctor. UH, and he's got this, he's a teacher at the university of California in berkeley and he, for whatever reason, doesn't believe that hiv causes aids.

Speaker 5:          01:10:40       Yeah, I mean, again, I think a lot all conspiracy theorists and all that shit is just about people going like they're lying. It's like calling bullshit all the time so that you feel like you have the upper hand

Speaker 4:          01:10:54       peter duesberg. yeah. This is the only thing, the only reason why I listened to this guy at all. I mean I don't, but the only reason why I would is that he's a phd professor of molecular biology at the university of California, berkeley. That sounds like a guy who knows things.

Speaker 1:          01:11:08       Yeah. But there's hundreds of guys that I know. It's just so funny when a guy like this, like this is my point of view. I'm in no way saying that hiv does not cause aids and nor would I ever. What the fuck do I know? I'm not A doctor. So what freaks me out is when I read. So you got a real nice dot. You've got forums like a rattle snake. This when a guy like this peter duesberg guy who is way more educated than me in the subject, you know, and way smarter than me to when this guy has some fucking, you know, all these, uh, website articles and all these published papers on this shit. And he believes that act was what was killing all these people back in the day.

Speaker 5:          01:11:51       God bless. Sounds it sounds completely nutty. Uh, yeah. Got bluffing.

Speaker 1:          01:11:56       I mean, he might be just as crazy as the person that's saying that the end of the world was going to happen two months ago, you know? No, it's funny how much worse alcohol is for you than aids says, look, magic johnson is alive and kicking with hiv, but amy winehouse is dead as fuck alcohol. yeah, that's pretty interesting. Uh, hiv aids is way more treatable. Yeah. Alcohol then like the alcoholism. Yeah. Alcoholism or even drug it certain like nobody wants to get aids. Again, alcoholics, you have to keep them from going back to getting it. Could you imagine if someone got aids and you cured them and they're like, oh, I just like to get some aids again. Shit. I got the itch for aids every day. What are you going this weekend? Hey, try not to get aids guys and try not to get aids, but that's alcohol. You a, you gotta keep those people from crawling back into that fucking alcoholics depression? No, I mean I do occasionally, but I don't need it. If I, if I go out to dinner, I might have a glass of wine or something like that. If I go out with some friends and somebody wants to do a shot, I usually don't say no, but I could go the rest of my life without drinking the night be I feel the exact same way. But the marijuana, because the idea of, of being

Speaker 5:          01:13:07       like, I need a alcoholic, you know, get rid of my inhibitions. I don't really have any inhibitions.

Speaker 1:          01:13:13       Can shoot with your arms up in the air like that. Exposing your armpits. You don't give a fuck. I really like doesn't even have any inhibitions. Look guys, this is like some shit that you would say to a check right before you booked your car. Oh, a buddy of mine used to say the greatest pickup line. You know this buddy. I want to think about it. Okay. I'll know it as immediately.

Speaker 5:          01:13:30       He used to say, um, you, he would go up to girls and go, uh, they say that spontaneity is a sign of intelligence and you strike me as a very spontaneous person would say we go back to my place and fuck or something and it would work. Is that your ideas?

Speaker 1:          01:13:50       How often would listen? We both intelligent here. Let's cut the bullshit in a muffler hanging out there. It was in the eighties, the eighties. This is pre a pre aids. Nice. Which is raw dog. Yeah. Rhonda, a. That's ted nugent

Speaker 4:          01:14:12       song. Raw dog war hog. One of his war. So, you know, I watched a show, jay. Well this is one of the reasons why because I look, I even from people that I disagree with them on some things I may agree with very much so and other things. And one of the things I agree with him is he's a hunter and he gets all of his food from his own ranch. He has this huge high fence set up with this, like, you know, several thousand acres he owns and taxes and he goes around on his ranch and shoots animals and eat. That's what he eats. He doesn't eat subsistence.

Speaker 5:          01:14:45       Yeah. I like the idea of that.

Speaker 4:          01:14:47       Yeah. I love the, you know, the fact that this guy stands up for people that think that there's something wrong with hunting, you know, and I think that's completely ridiculous. I think if you're eating meat and then you're telling people that they shouldn't be hunting, that's just fucking nonsense, man. It's ridiculous. You know, hunting is the. If you want protein from animals, that's probably the best way to get it for you. And it's probably the best way to get it for your head. So you understand what the fuck meat is. You know, I mean, the reason why american indians were, were so vigilant when it came to using every single part of that animal because they knew how god damn hard it was to get a deer. You know, you used every part of that animal. Nothing went to waste. Right. You know, and we, we have this incredibly wasteful society, incredibly wasteful attitude and I think hunting and gathering up your own food just to, you could put that in your hand. That's really what you're eating. This is where it comes from.

Speaker 5:          01:15:42       Well the other day about if they thought the recession would change people's character somewhat, like if, if, if because of now that because it seemed like everyone was rich for 10 years and now now it seems like everyone's poor and you hope, I mean at least because I would drive around la and go like make a good living and I don't have a bmw or I don't have a poor whatever these cars are and I would always think why do people. So I'm hoping that it'll go back to. I hope people's values will be less materialistic. I kind, I mean I, I could go either way. I can make an argument either for either for either being likely to happen because they're not going to stop promoting consumerism like

Speaker 4:          01:16:29       bore. We're locked into a certain pattern of behavior and it would take something monumental shift that it would take some 19 sixties type shit. Where's everybody got on acid? It would really take something like that. It would just something

Speaker 5:          01:16:41       that's ever going to happen again because I haven't. I've just had a theory that those computers are two good shit's too sweet, man. Too fucking easy. Sit in my house or go out and riot, go out and pick it and go out and you have the reason those kids in london we're riding is because they fucking are poor and they have nothing to do.

Speaker 4:          01:17:02       Listen, there's a. There's a thing going on in Florida right now where they have a real problem with these pain management centers and what it is. Legal drugs, right? See cotton's. Yeah. You can get them at a pain management center where you go in and you literally go to a doctor and then right next store from the doctor after he writes you a prescription. There's a pharmacy. It's all inside the same building and what it is is they figured out a way to make heroin in a pill form. It's really that simple. They figured out a way to make heroin in a pill form and then it got released. Well, if someone ever does release, whether it's sill assignment or whether whatever the fuck it is, when they start releasing it as a medicine and they are working on that, yeah, they. There was a thing a couple of weeks ago, but yeah, they are.

Speaker 5:          01:17:40       I have the perfect dosage. They have the dosage exactly. Not too much and that will get everyone nice and high.

Speaker 4:          01:17:47       What's going to happen is that shit's going to get out just like it gets out in Florida and I don't know what state it's going to be that it's going to be one state where the pharmaceutical companies make some fucking creepy deal with congressmen and senators and somehow or another they allow, like in Florida, doesn't have a database with the way Florida setup is. You can be a doctor. You could prescribe brian's and oxycontin's and then brian goes next door to me. I'm a doctor. I prescribed him oxycontin and he goes down the street and he just keeps going. There's no database. You just go to as many places you want as long as you know, come in, scratching your fucking skin off with blood coming out of your eyeballs. They just move you onto the next.

Speaker 5:          01:18:21       Yeah, but I don't think. But even the cyber selling thing, I think it's, if, if you feel like your. I just feel like we're locked into this thing of like possession.

Speaker 4:          01:18:31       Well that's what would cure that. Big groups of mushroom uses. Mushrooms, users getting together and forming communities of. You can have a lot of people that have had these, like changing these transforming love experiences where when you do mushrooms, man, you really do love everybody. Man. You really have this joy for all things living around you in this, this sense of this sense of a symbiosis, a sense of uh, uh, connection with everything. Whether it's the molecules of the air, the grass, the trees, and this, this, this connection that you can't feel when you're on it, and it could be completely an illusion or whatever, but alcohol is completely illusion to. And the culture of alcohol. Absolutely. Shapes in area and the culture of

Speaker 5:          01:19:15       it makes you hate everyone around you. Culture of silicide been with a graph and would be the best thing for, for a society because that what alcohol does to you, it makes you angry. No, it actually, again, it just makes me sleepy. It just may. I need energy and like I don't have a, uh, an excess of energy so I can't be like, if I were going to do drugs, I do cocaine or speed or something. I've never done any of them, but not do any drugs at all. Nothing takes all. Often I would do shrimps.

Speaker 4:          01:19:43       Well you shouldn't do shrooms if you take zoloft. I believe that that's not good for you. I believe that you're not supposed to combine those two.

Speaker 5:          01:19:49       Uh, I haven't in a long time. So how long have you been on zoloft? Twelve year. Wow. Yeah. What does that do for you? Uh, it makes me not want to cry. It makes me not like, it makes me just put paper over the mirrors. Yeah, that's true. Nice one.

Speaker 4:          01:20:12       Oh, what do you hate?

Speaker 5:          01:20:17       Have you always been a sad person growing up or did you just get a little off after? No, I was always a sad person. Did you ever try anything? Like a regular exercise like running? Yeah. Did that help? No. No. I mean it helps. Like in, in the cocktail, I think I'm better off exercising than not. So it adds to it. Yeah. But it, but I don't, but if I took nothing and just exercise, I just get real, like low energy,

Speaker 4:          01:20:44       zoloft, particular look, you guys couldn't be money. Zoloft in particular has a supposed to have a psychotic effect when you introduced it to cocaine, cocaine and zoloft together as supposed to be very bad. People have psychotic episodes.

Speaker 5:          01:20:58       Got it. Yeah. I mean, I. There's no risk of me doing cocaine. No. Um, but there's, there's a real risk of me doing last.

Speaker 4:          01:21:05       Yeah, you should. You should find out about that from someone who also has it in. Does it

Speaker 5:          01:21:09       now, have you tried to take a break from it? Like have you ever felt like I took a couple of years ago I took a break and I remember I'd be out with my girlfriend at the time and just at dinner with her and her friends and I literally will be falling asleep. Not because like the regular reasons guy one guys want to fall asleep just because I, I couldn't, I was. So we're vegan at the time? Uh, no, it's back when I was eating meat guys. Fucking interesting. Um, so, uh, but I even, but I, I just realized before I started taking that five htp stuff that I started taking reasonable and up my dosage of zoloft, my neck and back and shoulders were fucking tight and knotted up all the time for like years. How often do you exercise? A couple times a week now I've been trying to extend. It's like everyday. But um, because I want to, I feel like, you know, like I said, I think it helps.

Speaker 4:          01:22:05       Did get a punching bag. Oh, greatest thing you can ever have. He blog so much stress. Get someone to teach you how to punch correctly, get a punching bag and just beat the shit out of it. You feel so good when you're done. It's like ugh. Like you know, I mean when you get angry and what do people want to do? They want to hit things. You know, there's nothing better than just beating the fuck out of this inanimate object. It just blows all that monkey dna out of your system. And then I feel like I'd break my wrist or something, wrapped them up. You wrap your wrists up. Oh yeah, yeah. You take your hands. It's not that hard. They sell these a gel wraps that are pretty easy to, to learn how to wrap your hands up and then if you're smart, you put a little athletic tape over that so it takes five minutes.

Speaker 5:          01:22:42       Okay, well I go to the gold's gym in venice that did they have a bag? The mecca body? Do you do squats there? I do the I do. And I take an exercise class with a bunch of 40 year old women

Speaker 4:          01:22:54       that would actually be funny watching a guy just lifting very little weight, screaming through it.

Speaker 5:          01:23:01       Uh, yeah. No, I, yeah, I take it with a bunch of 40 year old gets called body. Yeah. And it's actually a great class. It's, it's, it's on your, but to be more attractive. Shut your fucking mouth. I got it. All right. So you'll enjoy this joe barbell right? AdjusTable weights. Put as much as you want. My little little as much as you want. And then we do every muscle group in unison to music. Okay. So the weight is varied via the from person to person. Uh, but the exercise is the same. So you and you get every single group. Now are there women in the class at lift more than me. Yeah, there are. Joe, is that tough for me? Yeah. Joe is tough. But uh, I liked the class and, and those bitches better watch their backs because I'm going up to the 40 pound level when it comes to curls. Gateway class

Speaker 1:          01:24:01       says a lot for one arm. It's doing it for two homes. A lot of reps I would say.

Speaker 5:          01:24:05       Yeah. No, I'm doing all right. But that's the uh, that's no good. Hey joe, I want to apologize. But it's music. It's like a whole thing because I don't know. I know I basically figured out what to do, but I like the hour and doing it.

Speaker 1:          01:24:20       They make you do it, you do it to them, you follow up, there's a teacher. Whereas when you're by yourself it's hard to motivate yourself. Yeah.

Speaker 5:          01:24:27       And, and it's also, I would like take a break and go get some water and like this is like go, go, go, go, go. It's a good class.

Speaker 1:          01:24:35       Those fucking classes are hard man. You can poopoo them all you want. But a lot of those. Yeah, that's what they pulled out the steps and you start stepping up and down and throwing punches. That shit's fucking difficult. Yeah,

Speaker 5:          01:24:46       that's, it's. Well I think girls just like, it's that group thing, like they like going to the bathroom to get a name, like doing shit together. Yes. A worth guys. They yell at each other though. What do you mean? Just in general,

Speaker 1:          01:24:58       mrs rogan goes to the gym, there's a Bunch of caddy cons, a bunch of these uh, mostly name is the name of the chair and the day hunt. Yeah it is. Look it up on yellow pages and they fucking yell over who gets what spot and you know, they try to steal the right spots, the room and they yell at each other when they throw kicks.

Speaker 5:          01:25:18       I have a theory that women would be better off if they could punch each other in the face. All that like snapping and cattiness. We'd go out the window. That's why guys aren't, is cause we, cause I know if I do it more than twice, you're going to punch me and, and there is nothing legislating women's behavior that way. There is with guys. I've had guys on the set of, of tv shows that I was in charge of. There was a sound guy named charles who I sort of snapped at one time and he looked at me like, you know, I will fuck you up. And I never snapped at him again. It was one of, I just think it's like, it's a good thing to checked. Yeah. It's just as long as you know it's a possibility. It's true. like it helps regulate behavior.

Speaker 6:          01:26:04       I'm not saying that they ever should. I think it's always wrong to hit a woman, but uh, you know, what regulates black chicks, black chicks regulated video that I made a video that I made in the. Where the fuck was in milwaukee. There was a, I did a show me walking afterwards. I just went out and took pictures of people for an hour and a half and these black chicks guarded me. They put their back to the crowd and like student a semicircle and created this system where the people had to go through them this way. And when you entered in, you entered in only from here and then you left only that way. It was really funny. They were hilarious. So I made a video with them afterwards to my youtube. They will, they will fight my youtube channel's joe rogan.net.net. There's a video, I don't knoW.

Speaker 6:          01:26:47       It says something about joe rogan shows love to the milwaukee something, some stupid fucking some stupid title. There's nothing you can do. You just have to be stupid. Did I tell you I'm going to be in baltimore next week. Are you going to be more comedy factory guys? What is the baltimore common factor? It's a new club, I believe. Nice. Because for awhile they only had the um, they only had a in baltimore. They had the improv in the improv went under and I had never heard about anything else. I think it replaced the improv really. Is the improv the one that you went to like maybe nine years ago? We went a long time ago and it was like a whole outdoor courtyard area with a bunch of bars and stuff. Yeah, that's exactly what. Yeah, that place was dope at the same place. it's where the improv used to be.

Speaker 6:          01:27:35       Oh, what a great spot. That's that. That's a great spot. Apparently. It's nice. Okay. So what is it called again? The comedy factory in baltimore. The baltimore county factor. And what days are you there? Eight. Twenty five through eight slash 27, which is next thursday, friday, saturday. Folks don't miss this tremendous opportunity to see neil brennan. I personally talk about capitalism. I don't talk about my dick. You can talk about the ladies. I will talk about politics. Obama, you can argue with his socialist. Ask in person. I'm noT sure that I spoke to him for all his social ideals, but it just seems like people don't like it without thinking about it. You know what I think, man, I think you need to concentrate on yourself. That's what I think. I think it's a very complex system. It's very fucked up. There's lot of things wrong with it.

Speaker 6:          01:28:23       The big, the big question. The big key is how do you make yourself happy? Because nobody else has to figure it out on their own as well. And how you make yourself happy and that's, you know, everyone has their own unique answer to that question, but how do you make all these other people happy? Man, I'm not so sure it's socialism. I don't think that would work at all. I'm not so sure it's making everybody get paid the same amount of money for everything. I don't think that would work either. I think the reason why we have so much cool shit because there's a god damn race going on as competition going on. Some people rise to the occasion, absolutely, but I feel like it's we punish those that don't know. We have to figure out individually how to be happy. That's what it is, and we also have to figure out how to keep corporations from being so fucking corrupt and crooked that they are

Speaker 1:          01:29:02       able to get away with shit to get there.

Speaker 5:          01:29:04       Nothing's gonna stop because they're. The corporations themselves are buying messages saying, don't touch us. We provide jobs and that's all you care about and jobs will give you more.

Speaker 1:          01:29:15       Not only that, they're paying masses, masses of money, giant sums of money to help politicians tend to office lobbyists, lobbyists, campaign contributions. The all of the above,

Speaker 5:          01:29:27       I believe that is a massive key is campaign finance reform.

Speaker 1:          01:29:31       Gary, it's so scary that companies can just buy presidents. You. They could just have us convinced that bump we got to get into Pakistan. There's a lot of shit going on. Yeah. By the way, while we're there, we just found trillions of dollars in minerals. Oh wow. We're coming from. This is crazy. Oh, we found a natural gas pIpeline. the biggest source of natural gas in the world in Afghanistan. We never even knew it was there folks. I, we never knew it was their next stop. The Congo. There's a lot of shit going on the Congo and we got to get a lot of unrest. We got to shut it down, shut down, find a shitload of minds. The condo who fucked up the Congo so fucked up. Even the United States government is like, you know what? I know you guys are making billions over there, but you can have that crazy part. Is China going to war in the Congo?

Speaker 5:          01:30:18       A lot of. In fact, at one point I looked at my financial investments tonight. I was invested in a company called petro China, and I was like, what is that? And I went and they, they uh, god I want when I was investing in petrochina and uh, like lockheed martin and that was a petrochina is, it's a chinese gas company, but they'd get it all from africa. They get it all from either the Congo or uh, or, or Nigeria. just one of those dislikes.

Speaker 1:          01:30:51       The gas, you mean petrol? Yeah. Wow. So they're, they're, they're pumping it out of africa. Yeah.

Speaker 5:          01:30:57       And they're, they're buying, you know, it's like they'll pay both sides. They, they, they bought the government there. They've, it's, yeah. It's crazy. Yeah. It's crazy. And that's the thing is no one's gonna do anything because it's way easier to sit on your computer. I have, I have a theory that that crime went down when cable cable increased. I believe that they are directly correlated. I can't prove it in any way.

Speaker 1:          01:31:21       Giving people something to watch on tv makes less crime. Just people have shitty. They go, I want to get in and

Speaker 5:          01:31:28       involve. I want to. If you can get a laid with a lot of, by inviting a girl over and all that shit and having shit to do with her, I feel like that's, you will get a regular job just so if you can, if I can afford verizon, time warner and whatever else, I got to get them straight. If I can get posey than I'm. That's. I have that budget. That's my budget. There's also the thing. Did you see, did you read, um, a focus on New York times book? It was where they said the reason crime went down is because the crime started going down in 91 and abortion was made legal in a 73 basically saying all the guys that would have been 18 and criminals were boarded up a. Yeah. Which is, it's. And it's in that book a freakonomics that's interested in the first edition of freakonomics.

Speaker 5:          01:32:28       And you just go and they did it. Cool. You know what's crazy? They did it by state because certain states legalize it sooner and those states crime started dropping center to the month holy. Which is like one of those things where you go, wow, that's fucking awesome. If that's true, right? It's awesome. I mean, and people go, that's human, that's human engineering, whatever, But It's like social engineering, social engineering, but it's like, I don't. If you don't want a baby, go ahead and I'm going to take your word for it. You're going to say, I'm going to be a bad parent. I'm going to go ahead and take your work

Speaker 1:          01:33:05       for real problem with abortion becomes. WheN do you say it's not legal? At what point? You know when? When it's a baby inside. Is it still legal? No, no, no. Not when it's a baby. When you can see it. It's a baby and it can exist outside the womb. Okay. What a month before that. Is it a baby then? What about a month before that? Is it a baby then? It looks like a baby. It looks a little immature baby. When can you kill that? Know that gets crazy.

Speaker 5:          01:33:27       Well, yeah. That's one of those arguments. It's like, well, once you start having it, there's no good. You can't tell me like it's just a protozoa. It's like once this pharmacy a, it's a, it's a, it's a. As much as I don'T connect to it. When it's a bunch of seeds, drop it out. It doesn't seem to me. There are people that do believe that you can connect to it. Yes. I've heard that. The sperm and the egg and the just the thing splitting and splitting and splitting it. Like you'd go that that's a person. Some folks believe it's like the 49. No. Well that's the thing is once you. You can keep going back, you can keep going back to it anytime you jerk off. It's important. Yeah. I think they whole abortion rate. That's why I call my bathroom the abortion clinic because I go in there.

Speaker 5:          01:34:13       I jerk of joe's typing, but he would have given me a big laugh on that. I believe. No abortion clinic. Nothing we can say. I don't know. I was going to say I wish there was a camera that you can like in like check to see if it's like retarded. Like, like, like I just have a space there. Tests and yeah, you can test, so it's not 100 percent now like you'll, you'll know it's retarded. It's, they put it euphemistically, but it is basically your child's going to be a to say brain damage, disabled, whatever, and people, people, a lot of people get abortions because of.

Speaker 1:          01:34:51       Yeah, I'm the sole is supposed to enter the body and 120th day of pregnancy, that's the yogis believe that the pineal gland comes from the hundred and 20th day 919. So you can get rid of the baby before that and it's just a like how it made answers that the soul enters what happens to the soul. I feel like it's got like a bus ticket and it goes and it's on its way to the baby's house. One hundred 20 days there. It's got a suitcase. I'm, hello? I'm here. Where's the fucking baby?

Speaker 5:          01:35:23       Yeah, where's the soul? Good. Is it just go out and fart gun in the air? It goes away. It goes back. It goes back to the river souls. Hopefully that's the, that the uh, yeah. it's like either you're for or against, but all that stuff,

Speaker 1:          01:35:36       like not necessarily think either you're for it or against it. I think there's a rational argument that could be said that after a certain amount of time you shouldn't be able to do it. You know, these late term, pre at any fucking. Linda's got fingers, man. Did you use eyeball documentary?

Speaker 5:          01:35:51       The lake of fire. That's one of the best documentaries I've ever seen. This guy, tony kaye directed it who directed american history x and it's a bit of a lunatic, but he made a two and a half hour documentary about abortion over that took place. He shouted over like 10 years. So uh, any he focused on both sides. And when you come away with is it's fucking brutal weather whether you're for it or against it, you know, when they do an abortion, they and they, they have to find all of the parts in a, they have, they put it on like a medical thing and the nurse has defined two legs, two arms, like just read this go. That is so awful. I can't believe, but it's such a joy to watch the documentary. Hopefully it's unknown. What's it called again? Lake of fire and why they call it lake of fire. Uh, it based on the song and the biblical, uh, based on the bIblical thing that people that, that some don't. Some, some biblical phrase.

Speaker 1:          01:36:47       Yeah. This looks funny subject because when you bring it up, the ultra liberal amongst us will, will never let you say that. It might be bad. No. Well that's good.

Speaker 5:          01:36:58       The thing is I am liberal button. What I'm, I'm, I'm, it's one of those things where I just go, wow, I'm, I'm, I'm for it. But I'm not like for it. I believe it should be allowed, but I'm not like, I'm not on some like you fucking, you know, you had, you stand up as the best joke about it where the people are for it in case of incest or rape. And he's like, so you're for it. If the dad is an asshole, that's what he's saying. Like if the dad's an asshole then you're for it. But if the dads nice guy than your, than your foot. But because it's just as much a life, if the guy raped or insensitive,

Speaker 1:          01:37:33       the baby shouldn't be responsible for its data. And for the dad being a dick, that is an interesting way of looking at it. You allow It under some circumstances where you shouldn't. A man can't be forced to make a woman carry the life. Right? Yeah. That's a weird thing. Like saying that, that's like some tribal shit that's not very spiritual thinking that that's okay to kill people. Then, you know, we met.

Speaker 5:          01:37:56       Sorry baby. Yeah, sorry. I know you're just a baby. But if you believe it's. I'm sorry, fetus will go fetus. But yeah, that's the thing is I was having watched that documentary. I'm still for it, but it's a bit. Uh, it's my, my point of view is way more shaded and nuanced than, than it would be than it was before I saw the dog.

Speaker 4:          01:38:16       I don't think I have a right to tell you what you can do with your body, but I think it should be discussed when it gets crazy. You know, I, I have a buddy who is a, he was dating a girl and she had a late term abortion where she had to go to some illegal place and do it. I don't know why they chose to, but she was fucking pregnant and they killed that baby. You know that. That freaked me out. Man. Did. What did your buddy think? I don't remember because you know, I haven't talked to him in forever and I don't. I tried not to really question it than if it was happening now. There's no way I would not be able to, but you know, back then it was 23 years old and I was just like freaked out the front and this lady was fucking pregnant and they're going to suck that baby out of her and some illegal place. Yeah, no, that shit is that. I mean, no matter what, that's evil. There's, there's an you don't want to accept reality at that point is what's going on. You've decided to try to change reality. Is there an out

Speaker 5:          01:39:12       that's one of those blind spots though that we live with all the time. Like, but yeah, there's tons of things we do that are just like, that's pretty fucked up that you just walk past homeless people. You walk past poor people, you walk and you just go, ah, fuck.

Speaker 4:          01:39:27       The numbers are too great. If there was only a few of us, we wouldn't do that. You know? I've always said that people lived, they should be in tribes have like 500 monkey people. that's what we're supposed to be. 500 tribes have a few hundred people where we all know each other very well. That's normal

Speaker 5:          01:39:42       and I believe that women would stay in, raise the babies. I honestly believe that the way guerrilla style where it's like the women, all the women gorillas stay. They want the babies in the guys just do the parameter standup perimeter and fight and fight and protect.

Speaker 4:          01:39:57       That's what it's always been, man. Yeah. It's always been like that. It's just we have that same genetics, but now we're in these giant groups of 300 million people pushed together onto this one continent and we're confused. We're confused as to how to behave. We have all these weird instincts to fuck everything and kill your enemies and everything, but yeah.

Speaker 5:          01:40:15       Yeah, but you can't. That's what I've been doing a joke about. Like they that it used to be. now we have to be romantic to get women, but it used to be all we had to do before it was just chased them down and send to them. There's a reason why men are stronger than. Well, no, I know. That's what the are superior. That was it. Like that was a date. Yeah. Was just a chase was just. That's why chase scenes work in movies. Well, that's why dirty girls like to get fucking choked ad where the guy I got, I gotta be honest. We talked. I don't know if we don't as last time. It's, it's, it's not just dirty girls anymore. It's not. You haven't been out in, out, out since that real internet. Since you porn. Girls want to choked. I don't

Speaker 3:          01:40:53       know if all of them do, but a lot of girls want to want to get. I could trust me really, like I don't know what

Speaker 5:          01:41:01       your experience has been, but it's been a, maybe it's my, my credits or something, but it doesn't take long for them to bring it up.

Speaker 3:          01:41:10       I don't, I've never, I wAsn't doing it. And then I. And then I slowly but surely like when you're saying choke you mean grabbed them physically by the neck and choke them while I'm talking about in to linkedin, but it's not real choke unless you're doing real quick. Like, like I, I do choke but it's more like I'm just zach just like, hey, I'm choking you make a face. You know, girls slapped, choke a fuck that shit. It's all gone. So now it's all gone. So at the beginning, because it might be your crowd though, dude might be attracting a crowd is like literate and fucking they liked hip hop. I don't know who my credits, but I do imagine that I'm cool with black label. Most of them are white now. You know what's funny is he ever look at your crowd and go like, wow. ReallY? Like it's just, you just, it's people that if you

Speaker 5:          01:42:00       by them on the street, you wouldn't think that I bet that person would like me

Speaker 3:          01:42:05       really. And then, yeah, I mean, I don't know. I don't assume, I assume that no one likes me. So when people are there and eventually I'm going to be right. And when people are at the show, I just go. If I saw them in public, I wouldn't think, oh, that guy's, that guy's coming to the new and children. How many tour, how many shows have you perform now? How many months you've been doing the like the hour?

Speaker 5:          01:42:27       Uh, I just did a, I did it for a couple of weeks and now I'm back. And then I'm now I'm doing like club dates fairly regularly.

Speaker 3:          01:42:33       So are you enjoying this? I love it. It's great. I'm

Speaker 5:          01:42:37       saying it's like I just liked the idea of, of, of uh, uh, you know, what's funny is, and you'll, you may relate to, I would assume that I'm way behind you in terms of development standup wise, where your feeling about the audience changes. The more you do stand up. I feel like the first thing you have to do is just to overcome nerves, which takes. It took me years. I mean, I think it takes everyone using just reps, reps, reps, reps, right? yeah. Just get onstage gonna just get you as kevin wants to. My brother once said, you know, you're doing a lot of standup when you're comfortable onstage and uncomfortable at the grocery store, which is fucking true. Where you just do. The thing about the road is you do so much standup that you dislike when you're not doing it. You're a little bit like, oh, what am I? Oh yeah, no, it should be doing standup. So I finally got like not nervous and from tHat your audience, I'm no longer defensive against the audience. I know no longer see the audiences is thing I'm keeping at bay, you know what I mean? I no longer seat is like elian that I've got a whip and a chair and I'm like keeping them back. Now I see it more like I'm immersed like a diane fossey pit. Like I'm, I'm, I'm,

Speaker 3:          01:43:52       I'm like in the middle of the crowd and I feel like they won't overwhelm

Speaker 1:          01:43:56       that feeling, that you need to overwhelm them and control them and whipped them as basically the same feeling that unattractive men have towards women when they're unsuccessful. Yeah. You know, that anger that may have towards women, a lot of comedians have that angle audience. Absolutely. Because of the constant rejection. Yes. Or just say almost like fuck fucking people fucking just fucking people and you know, and it's. And the audience can smell it on you. Yeah. Immediately, of course. And so can women, you know, a guy coming to buy a drink. No fucking lesbian. You know, tony Montana, when a guys just ready to snap over to the other side, it's always the same thing. Well that's.

Speaker 3:          01:44:30       And that's the difference. It's like some girl said like, you're so smooth or something with like just nice talking to a guy who knows how to talk to a girl and it's like you. because you have to stop looking at it as a buyer, as a seller and you have to look at it as a buyer. That's in some ways I've stopped being like that.

Speaker 7:          01:44:49       Ah, right. Am I. What do you think, babe? Huh?

Speaker 3:          01:44:54       I used to do, yeah, a lot of dance and those guys

Speaker 3:          01:45:01       dot that they eat and eat and now it's more like, what do you. I, it's the chris rock thing of 90 percent of girls want to fuck 10 percent of the guys. Once you get into that 10 percent, you are officially a buyer. Like your 10 percent. You're in the top 10. What leaped you into that top 10 chappelle show? Next question. Show. And also just the fact that you have a credit credit and an age soon. Unexperienced meaning a hot girl. How soon do you pull out the. He was the cocreative chappelle show. First hour. You have a couple of january between 10 seconds and 40 seconds. So really if you're, if you're at a bar with someone. So neil, what do you do? Well, what I do when I was directing the, the pivot movie, I would, I would go, uh, I would go, you're, you're going to think I'm a douche bag, but I, I, uh, I, I'm a movie director and they've got like what, what do you. And then you just get like it is one of those weird ass jobs where it's like, so, so use by saying it, it just sounds so cliche. Yeah. It in la, especially if you're like, what do I do? I'm a director, but when you're actually working, when you actually have a job. So I don't, but so right now, so right now I say I'm a comedian, I'm in comedy. And then just leave it like that. Yeah. But you

Speaker 1:          01:46:22       got this ace in your sleeve that you want to pull out and want to pull out that chappelle show. How it, how long do you wait? It really all depends. Like if it's going well, you don't even pull it out for a while. It's going well. Yeah. No, I sit on it. Yeah, I get it. The old fashion way back again with the, with my own hands. I don't get enough credits, you get it just by being a community, but if she gets a little slippery was on a buddy of mine. Oh, don't do it that way. Dia

Speaker 5:          01:46:50       a tropic casually at the olive garden or so. No, you can't say I created the bullshit. You just lose. You mentioned garden every episode, right? Because it's the most generic restaurant I can think of that. But you always mentioned. I'll start saying chili's. You can't just say, you have to say a buddy of mine. You can't say like, you know, when I was directing, you can't, you can't name it, you have to go up. but buddy mine, I was, I worked on the show and did a chappelle show. My favorite is when I go to open mics that people don't know me and they go, what do you want me to say? And I go, uh, particularly, it used to happen a lot. I go and cook inch belsher and they go, what? That would be good to go. Okay. And then they would go because they, it's like a, I used to call it the atomic credit because it is one of the things like, whoa, take put that thing away.

Speaker 5:          01:47:41       Like, how about a fucking. You were on fallon or something new. Did you feel like that that was a lot of responsibility to live up to when you first started doing stem? Well, yeah, that's what [inaudible] my brother was. My brother kevin was slamming me that saying that like, you know, you're getting opportunities you don't deserve and all that stuff. And he said, oh yeah, I'm not a real comedian. And sloW your own brother said that to you. What the fuck is that about? It's about a growing up one of 10 and elbowing each other and wow. Petition of 10. Why do you think I'm focused on compensation? I got brothers that don't talk to me, you know, it's like wow. And if I blamed capitalist, uh, kind, uh, yeah, it's amazing that you have all these hippie ideals, dad on smoking with us. Uh, yeah.

Speaker 5:          01:48:23       So. And then we all competed with six guys. There were five brothers, so, uh, but yeah, it wasn't bombing as the creator chappelle show was worse than bombing as an anonymous guy. I've got to think a pressure on you. That's what I'm asking. No. Yeah, there was absolutely pressure. I mean, I wasn't like conscious of it, but looking back it was, it was definitely pressure, but that's. So that's what's nice to be in a place where it's just more like, I just, the is like, they just have, it's like the robin landing on your shoulder and fucking I'm now I'm a chimney sweep from mary poppins. That's who you are. That's who I am to the audience. So, um, you've done, you've started doing your own podcast. Have you noticed immediately and impact and like they podcast fans are coming to you? Not Immediately because we've only done two.

Speaker 5:          01:49:12       Our third one will go up this up now I think called the champs. Uh, and they, the, yeah, it hasn't happened yet, but, but I believe it will like it because I see just look if if 10,000 people listen to it then that's 10,000 people that I either sort of knew me or didn't know me or, or, or knew me and will now feel more connected because I think that's the new paradigm is the just feeding people, just constant feeding. Like here you go baby, are you still hungry baby babies, the audience in this metaphor, like you're just. And particularly you give them free stuff and that eventually go, hey, just so you know, I got to charge every once in a while. So you know, listen to this ad or it's like the little wayne paradigm. Little wayne put out four records that he just mixed tapes and the and they're good and they're really good songs.

Speaker 5:          01:50:03       And he just released him on the. And then when he came up with his record, the carter it people bought it. He was, he's the last guy to sell a million records in a week because I think people were like, I don't think if people implicitly knew that that's what they're explicitly knew, that that's what they were doing, but I believe that people were like, you know what, I've gotten so many of these guys songs for free. LeT me pay for a couple of them. I mean, I don't know. I mean I definitely felt like that was my point of view on it and I think that that's the new with this democratization is like, yeah, it's free like it is. The startup cost for thIs aren't massive, but there there's something and then you give it to people and you're, you're exchanging ideas and, and, and human energy for their time and then hopefully they develop a connection with you.

Speaker 1:          01:50:49       You know what I noticed? It's very sterile way of looking at it, but it's not, but it's a human. Here's what I've noticed.

Speaker 5:          01:50:54       I've noticed when I was on your podcast, a lot of people came and were like, hey man, I heard you and I didn't know who you were. I didn't know what you were about and then because of this, so I, I, so yes, to answer your question, people have come up, but not because of my podcast,

Speaker 1:          01:51:10       because of your podcast. I think what you're saying makes a lot of sense, but it makes it seem like you're analyzing it like the stock market, that connection. I'm only analyzing it in retrospect

Speaker 5:          01:51:21       cause I didn't because I was, I, I do twitter because I've always liked talking and little aphorisms like that and then I was like, oh. Then I realized like, oh, I get what this is. I get this model and I've only gotten him really since. DoIng your podcast is like where you said you've never had a connection like this with the audience. It's a connection and to get rid of a gatekeeper to get rid of a studio, to get rid of a television network.

Speaker 1:          01:51:45       Yeah. Is excellent. It's amazing to be able to do something like this. Look, this podcast has changed everything as far as me doing comedy clubs. Now I do very little publicity outside of just talking about it on the comedy club or just talking about it rather on the podcast and you know, everything has changed. The numbers of people that come out to see me has changed. The ease of doing it. I no longer have to fly in a day early and do running radio things. It's way easier now. Yeah, and that's. And that's just from basically giving something for free, but you, you're, you're friends with these people, you don't even know them and you're friends with them and they start thinking like you guys think and going over the thing, the ideas that get discussed on the podcast and talk about amongst their friends and all these good ideas. Blossom and grow. Yeah,

Speaker 5:          01:52:31       that's the, that's the thing of it. You do give it for free and it's. But it's not. It is. It's about the connection. It's just like I, like I said, I like talking. I like, I like people. I think I've got interesting, well thought out ideas that I can in a relatively

Speaker 1:          01:52:46       funny way. So it's like, yeah, I think people could benefit from hearing me speak. People will enjoy it for sure.

Speaker 3:          01:52:54       Yeah. No, they've been, like I said, people really enjoyed the last one. I was here last time. You need some marijuana in your life, kid brand, definitely. Abby did the thing about you being really tired and stuff? I, I really, uh, I, I have that too where I'm just a zero energy. I'm super tired most of the time I'm either depressed or sad or like, you know, and uh, but, but lately I've been like, you know, having a good time in my personal life that, that all magically just disappeared. Like went away. I've never done any kind of zoned off. I've never done kind of any prescription management. I've always been the type of person that needs it. But if there's anything that I would say would help me get through everything, marijuana definitely has just helped me tremendously. It has a built in self promotion mechanism. There is not a drug in the world that when you do it, people that you talk about more drug in the world is more beneficial in the daily business. Exactly what people have tylenol and they talk about topics like a mild psychedelic.

Speaker 1:          01:53:50       It's like a psychedelic digging use all the time. You can't do mushrooms every day. I mean you can, but you're going to fucking lose your connection to humanity. You could smoke pot everyday and it just makes you more empathetic. It makes you more, more real, makes you connect, connect to your real emotions better. The way you interact wIth people

Speaker 3:          01:54:07       takes away headaches. If I'd like to be as sharp as possible, I like my brain to function well. It doesn't fuck with your function. The brain it has in the past and getting the wrong leads on. There's two different rap weed. I know you had chocolate fever. So you smoke weed, you're smoking the. I go into a coma.

Speaker 1:          01:54:25       [inaudible] just gonna sit here and chill. I would, uh, you got scared. We try to offer it to you before the show. I thought about a scam. You got nervous? I ruined my pants. I could see it, man. Uh, no. I just don't. You mock it. It's like when a fighter gets hit and they shake their head like that was nothing. Usually it was usually it will show he got rocked. How about when someone gets to the point they didn't do guilty or not guilty? Don't be plead. Not guilty. Don't be doing. Not around here. I'm not saying marijuana is for everybody, but it is for you and help you tremendously. You can, if you can get me some, a vaporizer or something. Yeah. That could be. Can be smokIng because then it'll start smoking cigarettes and really thinks no. How long has it been? Ten years.

Speaker 1:          01:55:11       IT's been like 13 years ago. Already. Dirty, stinky fucking disease. Isn't it weird? He still went. Oh yeah. I had dreams where I smoke and I wake up like at lIke in my dream I'm like, the fuck are you doing smoking meth? And then I wake up and I'm like, thank god I had a friend, the friend the other day at work, some bad news happen, and all sudden he goes, I haven't smoked a cigarette and six years and he lights up a cigarette. I go put that fucking thing down. I go throw that thing on the ground, step on him. And he goes, yeah, I go, fuck that. You're not going to do. you're going to give in now for this. Don't

Speaker 6:          01:55:44       do it. Don't do it. So he stomped on it and he was already like, thank you very much. I to a fucking started smoking again. Three hours later he did. Yeah. If I smelled smoke $10,000, what is that? It's the most addictive product on the market. Apparently though I know a dude who did heroin who says that you can go fuck yourself. And everybody that says that it's tough to quit cigarettes. He goes, heroin is way harder to quit than cigarettes. And people always say quitting cigarettes is, were harder than quitting heroin. Absolutely untrue. He said, heroin is way harder. It is harder. But. But I, but I believe from person person. I'm sure it's. Well, I didn't, I didn't find quitting that hard. I just decided. But you still it still scratching?

Speaker 5:          01:56:24       Yeah, but I still worry about, about just getting into doing it again.

Speaker 6:          01:56:29       Is there any greater evidence that this, the, the politicians are bought and paid for then tobacco? Oh no. Well that's what I mean. It's like with the fact that they knew it was unhealthy and fifties and sixties and it took 40 more years. My doctor recommends chesterfield. absolutely took them 40 years to get it.

Speaker 5:          01:56:48       Only to the point where it's like, alright, you can sell them, but we're going to tack them at such a high rate. It's going to. We're gonna tax them at a cartoonishly irate.

Speaker 6:          01:56:56       It's amazing too that some people have actually sued for damage. You know, they've sued the tobacco companies in one. You know, there's been some big handouts, man, so people have to figure out who gets paid, who doesn't, how can they, how many suits can they allow? How many lawsuits really can be processed against tobacco companies. There's a fucking half a million people every year dying. 5 million worldwide, died prematurely directly as it was, you know,

Speaker 5:          01:57:22       well, I'm less interested in that and more interested in obesity in terms of in terms of the next terms of draining society, because that's where you go, hey, you can't legislate people's diets. It's like, okay, but it's a. It's basically a seatbelt laws iF, if, if, if, if you're going to eat yourself into obesity and then you're going to drain the healthcare system, you're gonna drive up. MY, my, the cost of my healthcare, the cost of the government. I mean that was a lot of the stuff with the tobacco industry. They had to pay states because states were fucking paying so much money to treat people with lung cancer that you kind of go, okay, well then what? That's got to be next. That's got to be. You've got an outlaw or tax cocacola or tax frito lay in it.

Speaker 6:          01:58:10       Why is that? Because it's the only people that abuse it. I would say that's way more ridiculous than taxing tobacco because look, the other day I was in a supermarket and for a goof I picked up a box of lucky charms and I took them home and I had a bowl of lucky charms. Yeah, it was yummy, but you know what? I eat healthy. I eat healthy, but I. I reserve my own personal right to eat something shitty every now and then. It doesn't mean that shitty food should be illegal because you're too stupid. Incorrect because physical, the physical addiction of cigarettes is far more pulling. Then the addiction to sugar. Sugar is like, that's a psychological addiction more than anything. Right, but you do admit that conviction. Do you notice in your personal alignment when she'll turn your email? It can be an addiction.

Speaker 6:          01:58:53       You know, I believe that's an addiction. I believe I am an addict. I believe on the computer addict. Yeah, and I want someone to tax seen people that cAn't stop texting. The kids stop texting him out of where they are. There. There was, I heard a story the other day that a couple in Korea they met online in some, you know, world war craft kind of thing. They met in person, had a baby and then just kept going to these, these cafes and uh, they had, uh, in their online world, they had a child together and they came home one night and the baby had died from their real baby had died from starvation because they were so hooked on the internet that they're idiots. That doesn't mean the internet, you know, I don't think it should be illegal, but I'm saying there's no, you're not saying the difference between shoe.

Speaker 6:          01:59:42       You can just go, well, sugar is a way more. People are obese that are, that are nice, but I like snickers bars. I liked sneakers. So you're bright, you're just going to get taxed for it. I'm willing to pay the tax, then you're going to pay a much larger tax. But that doesn't cure anybody. Let's resolve any of the problems. People have quit smoking by 40 percent. Smoking. Smoking is fucking way down from when, from 20 years ago. really 40 percent. That's pretty high. Yeah, and particularly among teenagers. Really. Yeah, as well. That's a good start. Yeah, that's what I mean like it is when they go. You can't legislate. Yeah, you can. IF you're smart about it. And, and it is, you know, it. This shit is a drain on society. What they should also do the opposite too, which is a making vegetables and healthy.

Speaker 6:          02:00:33       TheY would subsidize vegetables with, uh, with, by taxing snickers. You. So you're in favor of the government getting all lee Willie and people's business and taxing things. But again, it's people's business. But where's that money go, man. That's when the real problem was everybody thinks that taxing things is a solution, but you're going to give that money to an inept government. This is going to create more fucking jobs and it's not going to go towards what you want it to go tour. It's going to go towards many, many jobs being set up for the decimation of the, the spreading of this money that you've, you know, you brought in taxes. Most of the time you raise taxes, you're gonna raise government. The government gets bigger. There's more jobs, more people working in the government, very few things actually get fixed, but there'll be more people.

Speaker 6:          02:01:15       Okay, well, or you can everyone can, uh, the, the alternative in these indicates of cigarettes and it should be illegal to kill people. Illegal. I agree with you. I mean if you're going to keep anything illegal, number one should be cigarettes and I don't think they should be illegal. I think you should be able to smoke cigarettes every fucking day. Don't get me wrong, but if you're going to go by the law that the government has the pattern of behavior that the government has been pushing since forever, that they're looking out for the best interests of their citizens. But tobacco stats are pretty encouraging. I mean, if you say that's a good start, 450 million people or 450,000 people rather in this country alone, 450,000 just in this country, but in 5 million worldwide, hundred thousand, but still an insane number of people. That pile of bodies is fucking alcoholic.

Speaker 6:          02:02:04       Way more than that. No, no, no, no, no. Alcoholism related deaths. No, no, no, no, it's not as many as cigarettes, so it's like 150,000, but I'm saying you could drink yourself to death slow. I'm talking about the amount of people that stopped as a partially as a result of the higher taxation and just making them prohibitively expensive. Well, that's saying about maxine snickeRs. even if you. It may not be addictive to you, but clearly it's addictive to a lot of people. I would say if you want to tax the fucking holy shit out of cigarettes and keep selling them, I would say good. That sounds like a good idea, but is it possible that the money that you take from the taxes would directly go towards something that seems worthwhile? Will some. How about the lotterY? A lottery goes fucking builds roads. I mean there's the lottery build roads.

Speaker 6:          02:02:54       Yes, that's what It is. I mean there are tons of things. The lottery in england pays for fucking the bbc. He's amazing. Yeah, I mean it's such a. It's and you want to talk about that shit. The lottery should be illegal. Well, and sorta. Yeah, but not really. You can do it. We're stupid people. It should be illegal is shorting things. How has that nuttiness of gambling illegal in, in the stock market, the nuttiness of gambling, like the guy who shorted america's credit rating, that somehow or another I actually have no beef with that guy because if you bet on contraction, yeah, but you're betting that's. Then yoU're betting you're not investing in the snob, but in an investment is gambling. You're gambling that this company is going to become more sort of, but you're supposed to be educated as to the benefits of this company.

Speaker 6:          02:03:46       I mean, when you write in fucking lockheed martin. I didn't even know her, but I'm saying you, you, you don't thInk of it as gambling. You think of it as investing. I am I absolutely family. I think the stock people don't have any sense of the term is not that people no longer buy things because they believe in the company. They just look at the metrics and go, no, that's true. That's not true. I know a gUy who, uh, has apple stocK, he's a huge apple fan and one of the reasons why he's all excited about the apple stock doing so good and she's a fucking apple fan. He loves It. I think there's a company mall, small percentage. I don't know, I think it might be a small percentage, but I think some people that invest, they do invest with their people that invested in, for that are all excited at ford's doing well because it's an american company, you know, they invest with their head and their heart, but think that that's not

Speaker 5:          02:04:38       the average person. Yeah, I think the average per. I don't. I'm a relatively smart guy. Like I keep saying, uh, and, and I, uh, I invested, I don't know what I got into like a green investment thing because I'd like them to do well, but I'm probably losing money. RiGht. You know what I mean? Like, I, I like it. It's a stupid way to my, my financial guy was like, this is stupid. Just let me put it in petrochina, lockheed martin, koch g, you know, all that, all these monoliths.

Speaker 6:          02:05:09       And so you manaGed it, you it, then you did.

Speaker 5:          02:05:14       But I was discouraged by a, by a relatively. You know,

Speaker 6:          02:05:19       I see what I just. It seems to me that the idea of shorting seems crazy. The idea that you can gamble, that's when it's really gambling. Anything else to me seems that it's investing. You invest your money, you buy shares of a stock that you believe in, whether you believe in them because you like them or whether you believe in them because you think it's a good. It's a good investment that they're growing and they're going to continue to grow. You like the way they're set up. I think that's one of the few naive point of view. You hold your singing that like a singer or holding their thing. Why is that name? Because people just are in the stock market to get to make a profit. They're in it to make a profit, but they look at this as this is gonna make a profit. This is a good sound investment. If I've done my bit,

Speaker 5:          02:06:01       I do with. I liked the company. I like. It's just they haven't.

Speaker 6:          02:06:04       It doesn't have to do with that. I can see that. That doesn't have to have anything to do with. It could be that you just look at the, they appear to be continuing to be profitable. That makes sense to me though, that you can invest in something that it could be profitable. I'm going to invest in. It doesn't make the opposite where you go. It's like because you're gambling, that's what I don't understand you are. You are literally saying I'm willing to bet a billion dollars that this fucking country, if it goes up, that's the thing. It's not like it's the same

Speaker 5:          02:06:33       inverse of benny of investinG. You're going, you just basically you borrow money, you borrow a million dollars. Uh, and, and with that you have to start paying back. You have to.

Speaker 6:          02:06:44       I understand that. I understand the concept. I just, I see it as just the inverse. It seems fucking crazy. Luckily I'm not in finance, nor you. Brian, what are you doing with your sleeves, todd? Doing it is how you are trying to play this. Neil's rolling up and for a long time I think. I think this is it.
