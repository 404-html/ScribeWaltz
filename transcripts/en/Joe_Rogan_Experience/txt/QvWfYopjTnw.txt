Speaker 1:          00:00          Does that ever came up twice? It's very. I'll do it. Just things very clunky. It's ustream thing. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you very much for tuning in my guest this week, the lovely and talented Mr Doug Benson, Benson, everybody. Before we get started, we have to mention that the show is being sponsored by the fleshlight. Doug Benson. Have you ever fucked one of these things? I have not. I heard you and Dane Cook talking about it last week. There were awesome and it's really like takes masturbation to a whole new level. It seems, you know, it's a very embarrassing thing to purchase. It seems like that. Has that one been used or is that just. Would never do that to. Is that just the recent. Well, not that you would necessarily mess it up just by holding it or whatever because you don't have to touch anything. I mean, no one's fucked. It wouldn't give you one at someone's thoughts. Good. Yeah. Yeah, that's wrong. Right. Have you ever fucked a nine tastes flashlight one? No. Like I just fucked one of the other day. Completely different. It fucks it. It doesn't feel anything like better or worse. Way Worse. Way Worse. Yeah. Somebody else told me,

Speaker 2:          01:00          I think it was half ron so that he fucked a, a knockoff for a fake flashlight. You said it wasn't working,

Speaker 1:          01:06          but these are outstanding research and it'd be awesome. But now I totally get what you were saying last week about how it just doesn't, it just doesn't feel right in terms of you feel bad about yourself or embarrassing. Yeah. Because it's fun. That's one thing. Like I guess he'd get a little bit of A. I've had other light arm workout, but take it back.

Speaker 2:          01:28          Right. Turn my volume up. I've had other people, um, um, uh, talk to me about this thing and it's a, it's an embarrassing thing. They're like, why would you want to be represented by this rubber vagina? Like he keeps coming up. It came up with like another person that was thinking about sponsoring the show. They don't want to be connected with the flashlight.

Speaker 1:          01:46          Really? That's so weird. To me. It's childish. It really childish. Now you just get that, that company and fleshlight to outbid each other until

Speaker 2:          01:55          like that. But then you would never know. I mean, you know, then you show no loyalty to something that you actually believe if you don't believe there's anything wrong with fucking this thing and you want to protect. It's like one of those things where people don't want to talk about sexual things because somehow or another talking about sexual things and it makes people uncomfortable. It's creepy, but it's a natural part of life and like most rational people at a certain point in time, just to kind of accept that and then you can joke about it and go, hey, I fucked this rubber pussy.

Speaker 1:          02:22          Ha Ha. Is it good? Yeah, that's great. You should try it. And then everything's good. But for some people it never gets to that place. Nevertheless, I think it depends on how comfortable you are with like other men like who you kind of came up with and if you all talk to each other that way or not, you know, like I had a lot of fairly prudish friends, like we'd say dirty things, but we wouldn't admit to any of our own personal activities the way that I've seen other groups of friends do it, you know, like you see these packs of people that all just have a different code about, you know, whether they fucked a prostitute or not. It's going to come up and one group, but it's not going to come up and into the whole. Totally. That's so important. So important.

Speaker 2:          03:00          Hanging around with the dudes are going to tell you everything that's so huge. Embarrassing, ridiculous, retarded, all of it. I want to hear it. Come on, give me a little.

Speaker 1:          03:08          Well that's. You must get some good stuff from everyone I know from. Yeah, but also like there's like really kind of almost a code of standup these days is to just be super honest and it ends up just to be original. You kind of have to talk about some stuff that's pretty brutal and out there, you know? Yeah. You can't really do. I mean, it's almost like the Jerry Seinfeld route has been said so many times and gone down so many roads. It's like I don't see anything there. It's like, if you want to do standup today, it's like, you know, Jerry Seinfeld as Jerry Seinfeld, you know, that style is hilarious at it, but I don't want to see a new one of those will also. He sort of teach, sort of turned it into another thing. Like he made it popular. It's more fun now to watch actors on a show like the office recreating awkward situations that happen every day than it is here.

Speaker 1:          03:54          One guy just describing it. Yeah, no, he's the Seinfeld show. Just sort of brought to life his comedy and that made him a funnier guy to me because prior to that he was a pack of part of a pack of guys that all just did clean cut observational humor. Uh, and I love them all. I thought they were really funny. Like guys like him and Larry Miller and, and you know, there's a bunch of them. Yeah. I was a fan of the evening at the Improv. Yeah. Yeah. And those guys were on those things all the time that I totally grew up on watching that stuff. But then immediately embraced stuff that's more, you know, like you can, you don't have to just observe things. You can experience them. Yeah. I want to hear it.

Speaker 2:          04:36          Like really tell me what you did. Not what everybody does. I want to hear a dangerous thought to admit. I want to hear, you know, I want to hear some, some truth that we can all agree with. I want to hear something fucked up to. I don't want to hear the regular shit. I'll get bored with it. I'm tired of it. I want to hear something. You know, I look forward to Joey Diaz sets more than anybody. I like strong joke writing though, you know

Speaker 1:          04:58          that that can get me through. But. But you're right. It's like as soon as he starts to be too much about, like best as both, right? Yeah, of course. Yeah. I love anyone who, a great joke writer and a good performer. That's, that's unbeatable. That's like a Louis Ck.

Speaker 2:          05:16          Yeah, but you're right about Seinfeld, like he was, uh, he was such a brilliant joke writer and deliver like in his style and then to have that show and then you really see where, you know, curby enthusiasm. Really good to see where Larry David had a big hand in it too because once I started started seeing that show, it was like, oh, okay, this guy is like the king of creating like really awkward situations that like, literally you watch some of his shows and you find yourself contorting because you're like, what you fucking saying? You know, it's so good. It's, he does such a good job of weaving that Web.

Speaker 1:          05:49          He's one of my masters. Izzy. Yeah. Yeah. It makes it up a notch to that. It's like on Hbo so that the language in those situations can, like that's part of it. As he often says, you know, he often says some, he swears inappropriately in front of people sometimes that in subject can't do that shit on Seinfeld because it had to be all t view appropriate.

Speaker 2:          06:10          You remember when there was the water bottle in his pants and there was a little girl and you know, there was some implication like people thought that he had a hard on because the little girl was there. I forget how he set it up, but I was like,

Speaker 1:          06:20          wow. Yeah, if you listed everything that he was guilty of in the seven seasons of that show, he's done some pretty horrible things, you know, like just the worst thing in every situation. You know, like, I forget what he did to some Holocaust survivors, but it was, I'm sure it was awful.

Speaker 2:          06:38          Shows like that are so important. Show you that there's like another level out there, you know, like I think that's important for stand ups though, don't you think it's good sometimes to watch somebody else you know, and somebody really good, you know, watch like a bill cosby and his prime or something like that. Just to really get inspired or you know, just really kick it up to another, another gear.

Speaker 1:          06:58          Yeah. It's always good to. I think that's a huge part of. I hate to give advice to people starting out, but one of the things I say to them, if they insist on having some his watch as much standup comedy as you can and unfortunately we get kinda tired of watching it is after we've done it for years and years, but it's still important to, to kind of check into it every once in a while because it just ups your game when you know what, what everybody else is doing. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          07:22          Buyers, you know, it does something to you makes you excited about performing that I'm most excited about writing after I see like, you know, I'll see chappelle perform. I go, fuck, I just want to go. Right. You know, it just makes me want to create

Speaker 1:          07:33          shit, you know? Well that's the other great thing about being a standup is when you have that impulse, you could just come up with one great joe could be satisfied. Like I hate it when I see a great movie and I'm driving home like I'm going to write a goddamn screenplay and that that's just too big of a task to really commit to in that moment of excitement. But writing a joke, well you know, you're excited about writing jokes and you write a good ones. Like, okay, I did that 10, 20 minutes work and then you're in and sometimes they come in full form, you know, they'll just come to you out of the air. It's like a little gift. It's amazing. You were talking about that with Dane Cook about say something on when the crowd is so great. The next sentence after the joke is probably going to get a laugh anyway, but when it gets a huge laugh then you've suddenly got a new end of the job.

Speaker 1:          08:20          I right out of the ether. And that's how most of my I, you know, I do most of my writing on stage just in the sense that I, you know, sometimes I have a joke that's worked out perfectly beginning, middle and end. But for the most part it's more like, this is sort of something I want to try to address and then just see where it goes and have have a, have a good joke ready to go right after it if it ends up not, not ending up getting anywhere. Yeah, I agree with you. I do. I do both. How high you get before you go onstage. I'm well now people think I'm high whether I'm high or I'm not like they just accused me of it regardless. So you know, it, it can be as high as I want to be, which is just, you know, it's just all comes down to timing.

Speaker 1:          09:03          You know, if you have to race from the airport, if you have to raise it from the airport to the Gig, you might not be very high. But if you're, if you're chilling that day and you've got to show at 8:00 and not much to do in the afternoon, other than, you know, work on your computer and interviews and stuff like that. Like I get really high for interviews now. Like foreigners. Yeah, me too. I love that. I love being super big because then when they do throw to you, you, you will talk until they, until they stop you and sometimes sometimes they don't jump in so you can really get a lot of stuff in. I know I find myself like almost like feeling bad for what I'm subjecting the interviewer too sometimes because it'll start on some like really innocent question and I'll just start going on about, you know, the, what is the cause of humanity, what are we here for?

Speaker 1:          09:43          Like this totally nothing to do with anything we're talking about, but in my mind what I'm thinking about is, you know, the whole vision of the world and where it's headed and you know, it might've been a really simple question. Yeah. They need you to wrap it up so they could play some more Kesha. Yeah. And I'm just super bank going on about the universe. It's like it's all coming to me and these big waves. I just need to get it out, you know, it is fun to get high and then write, you know, or, or sometimes. Have you ever done this? Have you ever gotten high? And they went, Oh crap, now I'm starting to have ideas and I'm not in the mood to like, I'm not ready to write down ideas right now. I wanted to just get high and watch TV. It's like, now I've got it. Now I've actually got to go to work for a little bit because the ideas are too good to ignore. I got way too high the other day and went on stage and went to the, uh, I was at the John Lovitz comedy club. So you think this dude was on a plane with Lovitz the other day? Hey, I got in his eye line a couple times to see if he knew who I was and he had, he had no idea. But if it was like, Holy Shit, you, Doug Benson, would that give you, am I,

Speaker 3:          10:43          uh, well, no, I wouldn't want, I, I, well, I mean he has been in a lot of great things and he and I, I've always thought he was funny

Speaker 1:          10:51          guy, but um, he, he was so sad sack acting that it would be hard to be excited about it. He's a nice guy, he's a real nice guy, but he was kind of like traveling by himself. You know, how that is. You're just like humping through the airport, like, you know, just want to get it over with. Just don't want too many people to, you know, I'm sure like he must have gone through a period of time where there's some catchphrases that people yell at them or they, they'd say you're a liar all the time. Yeah. Yeah. He must, he must have used to. Got that a lot. But now I'm sure he doesn't get it so much. But

Speaker 3:          11:22          why don't you use technology to help with your ideas though, because I know that you, uh, instead of writing it down, just like talk, make a movie, do the audio because that's right there. And you're starting to get there. Like I finally got the most recent iphone. Oh, he did? I made the first video that I ever like a uploaded on the Internet where I just filmed myself doing something and then, and then send it out there. And uh, I'm definitely going to do more of that. It's

Speaker 1:          11:45          smart way to go. It's super fast. It's super smart and fast and it's, you know, people love content. They want you to keep doing stuff. But what were you saying about being at the love it's club comedy club. Oh, I got way too baked. This guy gave me a cookie in between the stage Joey. There were like these little, um, what are those little long banana shaped things called know I'm talking about the Scotty. Scotty. Not really banana. That's the closest thing I could see. The banana. How do you describe that shape already shaped cookie.

Speaker 1:          12:22          Cookie cookie. Cookie canoe. This guy, I didn't even eat a quarter of one man I didn't need. He goes, they're really strong. Okay. Just, I took a bite. One bite 45 minutes later. I was onstage and I was a board and alien space craft while I was talking to these people. I mean I was barely. They're barely there enough to communicate. I was so high. There's no way I should have been talking in public. That's a surreal space when you're onstage there too, because of the way they have that, those, those balconies, balconies or rather close to you, but just up high, very shallow but high and it's uh, it's, it's kind of exciting, but also a, it's different than what we're used to. Yeah. It's cool. I mean it was a fun club. Weird about that club is how the bars open and so halfway through the show you're just hearing clicking and clunking and people that have a lot of put a curtain right?

Speaker 1:          13:14          Could, but you know what, it ain't that bad. Like San Francisco Punch line doesn't have a career yet and that works out okay. Yeah, that's far. Somehow it adds to the ambiance stuff. As long as people aren't Douchey, it doesn't matter, but you are right. It does give an opportunity for things to get annoying. Anytime you have a bar where people can stand in order a drink, you're fucked or divert attention from the crowd quietly because people, people start hitting on people and talking. The last show I did, like where it was a standing room show, me and Joey did this show in Memphis and was like this last minute booking and it was a, um, a rock club and so we're like, all right. Yeah, they have bands there. Fuck it. Well, you know, I'm sure it will be set up fine. And the guy's like, he wants to do standing room.

Speaker 1:          13:55          I usually don't. I said, okay, fine, fuck it. The whole half the room was standing, half the room was seated and was really strange. It was like you're standing on stage and to your right, everyone seated and to your left is a bar. So literally like everything to your left is like, there's like 200 people just standing and talking. Yeah, of course you're doing standup in a bar and the bear, they're barely paying attention. They're acting like a band is onstage. I used to do that, the house of Blues too, but now after we went to see stan hope and we had a stand and it was horrible. It was like after an hour, like your fucking back hurts your neck starts to kink up, and so I said, I'm not going to subject anybody this anymore. It is. I feel bad for people when they're standing during the show.

Speaker 1:          14:38          Do you ever say no that you won't do those shows and just haven't. Uh, I haven't really gotten to that position where like, you know, if that's an option and that's going to get more bodies in the venue, gets less bodies in the venue, you lose money. But it's, to me it's better to let him sit. You mean to let them sit? Yeah, yeah, yeah. That's the thing. It's so I am not as big a deal. I'm not such a draw that they're like coming to me begging me to let everybody stand. You know, I've been on Comedians of comedy tours with, with patent oswell where everybody's standing and it's, uh, it's amazing how much they'll put up with David Cross standing shows all the time and his shows go on forever and he has bands come out and that crowd is, is okay with it, but I don't think my crowd, I think stoners would rather sit down finding okay with it.

Speaker 1:          15:25          I would. I mean if there was an only an opportunity to go see a great comic, you know, someone, you know, even if I wasn't even doing standup, it was Chappelle or someone like that, I would stand. I'll stand for two hours. I mean, how often is this guy come to town? Once a year should I can stand for two hours once a year, but it's not the best feeling. The best way is to sit down and chill. He sit down and chill and then you could really enjoy the jokes when you're sitting down, relaxing, everything's more fun. It's what's the worst is when they have couches in a comedy club like, Oh, here's the VIP seats. And it's like a couch in the back where they not only can get loud, but they also just are lounging around. It's not the right to. It's not the right posture to watch comedy unless you're like stoned or something.

Speaker 1:          16:05          Yeah, you're totally right. I like it when the seats are fixed, fixed seats into the so they can't even move. I'm like at the comedy works in Denver. I was just going to say that that place is crazy. They got those little tiny trays that are smaller than a school desk or we're an airline tray and you just put. They just put their Nachos and their drinks on it and the people are in there so tight and it's underground. It's really. That place is almost perfect. The only thing I'd say that I don't like about it is just a, you know, it gets a little rowdy sometimes it gets routed to the crowd. Noise is like, it's so it's a win win. They're cheering for you and applauding because it's so loud. But then when they're talking amongst themselves, when they're like, you know, losing focus, that's really loud to Denver's pretty wild man.

Speaker 1:          16:49          Colorado people get wild. Yeah. It's a lot of wild cowboy in Colorado. I think the alcohol and the weed both hit you harder because of the altitude. Fuck yeah, it does. You're a mile up in the air man. Yeah. So if we try working out up there. Yeah, I've tried, tried doing a lot of things there that I regretted. I went to an amusement park there one day. Oh my God. And uh, yeah. And it's just like it, it was fun, but much more exhausting than going to an amusement park should be. Yeah. I can only imagine. Yeah. Walking up hills is tough up there. I went hiking once and it was like a full on workout. Like I was breathing heavy and sweating and it's like, this is crazy. This is not where you want them outline to catch you while he's out of breath and shit can even make it up the hill.

Speaker 1:          17:33          That's the way Joe Rogan thinks that there might be a mountain lion. My dog. Oh God, I lived when I lived in Colorado. My dog had eaten by crap. Yeah, we saw the mountain lion. I've had weed in Colorado. You've hidden it at a comedy club and I've been waiting for the day to go back to this comedy club to see if it's still there. It gets kind of like. I mean already we're talking about the other day we started hiding. We'd at comedy clubs throwing it away and stuff because we'd never go back to smart. No, it doesn't. I mean, and it loses its potency a little bit, but you're talking about six months to a year. It's fine. It's gonna be dry and you're going to hit you harder. You're going to get stoned. Really? Yeah. Joey likes drawing is weed out. He takes us like a radiator to shut up.

Speaker 1:          18:14          I used to keep it in the freezer. Really? Yeah. I used to do that to bay. It gets moisture in it that way. I like it dry. I like it to burn and make it a point. The freezer. It's supposedly you put anything in the freezer at last longer be like batteries. I'm asking you that, but we want to put my coffee in the freezer. I don't know why I do that. Yeah, exactly. There's a weird thing. I just did it because people suggested it or somebody said it somewhere and then after awhile I was like, why am I doing this? Get into this. We'd fast enough that I don't need those for another generation. Right. This edible thing taught me a lesson amount. I will not eat anybody else's shit and then go on stage. It was known and he's one of those professionals.

Speaker 1:          18:53          Don't ever know the store. You're buying it from somebody you don't know. Oh No. Totally. Totally true. To me is always like, just eat half of this and every time I take them up on it, it's either much stronger than that implied or weaker than that implied like people are never really that. That's what I like about smoking. The people behind the counter and the dispensary can give you a little bit more specific guidance than you can. With edibles. It's always just like, yeah, that'll do it in about an hour. Some of these assholes put too much in. They need to get Amazon reviews. You're right. They need Amazon reviews. Every time you take a purple rec from this store, this is what happened, this is how much, you know, and there was a job in Colorado, one of the local newspapers to be a marijuana critic.

Speaker 1:          19:40          And I got the job. I signed up for it and they were like, are you serious? I'm like, fuck, yeah, I want to write. It was right before we had to move. But, uh, when I was there I was going to go to different stores and great them. Somebody else is doing that. Now they should think they gave that job to somebody. I remember reading about it somewhere that, that yeah, that's something they wanted to do. I, you know, I read it on some slab stone or something, some website was, uh, was talking about it. I thought of earlier when you mentioned Doug Stan Hope. Uh, it was funny a couple of days ago I worked at a club and the guy wrote me a check and I went home. I didn't really look at it and I went home and the next morning I looked at it and he'd written a check out to doug, Stan, hope like it was late and he was tired. And, and, uh, Doug plays that club too. So it was funny that he wrote down the wrong name, like degenerate number two, forgotten. No, you've never gotten a check. Says Joe Piscopo on Tony Danza Junior. Um, I signed credit card. It's just a flag that like anytime I sign a credit card, any kind of credit card slip, I always write something like, tacos. Let me ask you this.

Speaker 3:          20:48          Are you free to change the way you sign your kids? You can't say that your t's not a dot. What I'm saying, like say if you have a signature, write your signature. So it's supposed to represent how you write it. Write your own very unique way of doing it. Is it? Can you just decide I don't like it that way. Now I'm going to do this with a star in the middle of it. And you're just helping them out because then you could get every letter of the alphabet so they know exactly what your handwriting style looks like. Your signature. You still writing the same word every time. What I'm saying is could you just totally change it up? Yeah. That's what I do. Every time I changed my sign a credit card, I do Brad Pitt or I hate tacos. What's the point? If you're totally changing it up and if that's cool, if you're allowed to do that, what's the point in having a signature that.

Speaker 3:          21:27          Because you have to say, did you sign this is it's your signature. Yes, I did sign that. That's it. But then they say where it's a, where you're signing that screen thing. It isn't that kind of a. At least capturing the image and checking to see if it matches how you. No, no, no, no, no. It's just printing it on printing it. So you could just on those things, you could just type stars in anything. Well, when I was a kid, I could imitate gene Simmons's signature. I could imitate freely because I copied over their signatures. I was like a huge kiss fan and you could, someone could do that with you easy, especially in those little stupid things that the credit card while you're signing your name doesn't look like how you write your name. It's not even close. Who Cares? You know how I learned it because I'm a girl. I used to date type her name in cursive letters and it took fucking like an extra minute and I'm just like, that's it. You're not doing this anymore at this drives me crazy. It's the extra minute at the cash register. I just started signing up for her and I started saying like farts and face and talk. I usually just do tacos and stuff with Brad, but I'm interested in obsessions.

Speaker 1:          22:31          They've got the new taco shaped a Brad Pitt fleshlight if you'd like to try it. Yup. Uh, what that reminded me of something. Oh, what I do is I have a signature that I signed for stuff with. And then when people ask me to sign stuff, I just print my name, but I always try to say something nice to them. So it's at least personalized, but they're not really getting my signature there. Just getting my name written out. That church. How do you use. I'm just paranoid about this whole identity theft. So you won't sign things because of that? Yeah. Wow. That's weird. I mean why? Why let someone like a gene Simmons wouldn't want somebody to be able to do a great job with his signature, I would imagine. Yeah. Well you know, you should definitely be paranoid about identity theft when it comes to you

Speaker 3:          23:16          credit cards, but I don't really think you should worry about your signature. It's too easy to duplicate. Just carry around a stamp.

Speaker 1:          23:22          I have to. I don't think. I mean who, who has the kind of technology is there today so you can't read my signature and I think when you're signing something for somebody, when they show it to people, you know, if it has your name on it, that's one thing. But if you're just signing anything, then when somebody looks at it, I think it's nice to go, oh, that Doug Benson wrote that. My signature. You can't read his handwriting. I don't think it's that they're that good at that, at recognizing, you know, shit, I don't think there's, I think you could imitate it. You could figure out how to write so many signature and you could probably pull it off close enough. Yeah, you just have to find it somewhere. So if you watch them, if you film them, do it and you saw like how they do it, he could just imitate it. Well that's where my paranoia sets in is when I'm at the ATM, the beeping noises that the numbers make that takes the privacy out of the number. If someone was just watching the site

Speaker 3:          24:12          and, and recording it, right, they could figure out the numbers easy and then like, you know, Jack, you up around the corner and then use your card and take out whatever the maximum is. What did you see? The new thing, there's a new app for chase bank that you can actually scan a check front and back and with your iphone and send it and it deposits the check and then you just rip up the check.

Speaker 1:          24:31          Well that's too, that's too easy. What about the, uh, using your iphone to check in on the plane, like the Barcode ticket can be on your iphone and just run that. Yeah. My fear is, you know what your iphone is dead then you don't have a ticket. Yeah. And you're actually, I phones die man. Especially if you fuck around and die so fast, you know, you make a video and it's. Your power is half gone. Yeah. Yeah. You got to think about that if you're using the camera for sure. But it came, it's such a great thing to have a good camera. The other day we were in San Francisco and we ate some Chinese food after the show. It was like 2:00 in the morning we were outside and I saw it. I watched the whole truck. You tweeted it, I watched it and I was like, he must be so high because you kept saying is the craziest shit you ever saw. And I know you're a UFC fights every other week, so I know you've seen some crazier shit than a bunch of strippers in the back of a sort of weird plastic. Probably have seen some crazy shit, definitely, but it was crazy and I was so high. Yeah, yeah. I was just like, you can't believe it and now to be able to just share it with everybody. You were like double rainbow, but with a van full of strippers.

Speaker 1:          25:38          Excited about it. It was so ridiculous to me. It was such a sign of the times. To me it was like a scene in a movie right before the meteor hit, right before the aliens landed on today's show is video audio, timss video. There's this big idea, this big clear box that pulls up and there's girls dancing. It's a fish tank of skanks and they're dancing. I mean it was the most ridiculous thing I've ever seen in my life. It's for the Hustler Club. We had a rewind the video to find out what the comparable jump over because they should be sitting while it's in motion, can be dancing while we're driving. You got to sit your little quick. They didn't really like because that was what I was waiting for. His like them having to get out and get coffee. We thought that might have happened to be going to jail, like maybe it's illegal to do that because it seems so ridiculous, but apparently it's not.

Speaker 1:          26:26          One of the things it was funny is when we were filming the girl and I didn't film their faces. I wouldn't. I did specifically did it say it in a plastic card. If I'm going to put it online, you don't need to see your face on it for a week. All that shit on the Internet forever. So I use their face, but anyway, while I'm filming it, the girl goes, no filming. Like we're in the club like bitch, you're in front of a Chinese restaurant. Okay. You're not at the club. If we're at the club and I'm filming you, yeah, that's a dick move, but you just can't come out into the real world in your underwear and I can't take a picture of that. That's crazy. Well, that's like the a sexy top and the, you know, keep your eyes up here, Mr. it's like, well, come on Jesus Christ.

Speaker 1:          27:08          No, you know what you're doing right? You know how the game works. They only want you to look, I want you to look, but you know it's there for everybody because my eyes are here. God it. Yeah, let's do this. Popo beale for strippers and you don't want us to look at you. It's awesome though. It was awesome. It was just like such a. Such A. Just A. First of all, just a perfect representation of how nutty San Francisco is. I wonder if that Cisco's such a, but it's just that. Yeah, that probably no one will complain about that. No one. No one going. I'm sure some kids saw it. Oh, a lot there. It's just so liberal. They're so open minded. It's a weird town, man. I wonder if that law with sitting down while you turning the corner, if it came from like back in the old days where it's like a pickup truck and girls would just fly off the site.

Speaker 1:          27:52          I think you have to have your seatbelt on. I think if you're in a car, you have to wear a seatbelt. Right? I mean, that's a lot. You get pulled over for something else I think. I don't know. No, no, no, no. They can pull you up. I have no idea. I thought it was illegal. I was in a cab in San Francisco and the crusty older lady cab driver told me, she goes, if you ever want to drive around without a seatbelt on, because she goes, I don't like how seatbelts feel. I don't like to have it on. Especially if you've got big boobs, it must be an annoying thing. So uh, she fastens it behind her back so that it is because the cops look for is the glint of the buckle because you haven't got it pulled down. You have, you don't have the buckle.

Speaker 1:          28:35          So they see that and then they put, they can pull you over for that and then get you on for other shit, for glint dude over for that. And then they go, oh, we thought you had your seatbelt off. And then they can, you know, oh, we smell marijuana or whatever. If you get pulled over for not wearing a seatbelt, you're a Douche. Any cop just pulls you in. This is going to pull this person over. Forest. I like wearing it, to be honest with you. I've been pulled over for that guy told me to do it really? And he said, he said you were driving.
