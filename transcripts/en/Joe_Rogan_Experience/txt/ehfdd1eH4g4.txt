Speaker 1:          00:00:00       Package is supposed to be out with you. Five, four, three, two.

Speaker 1:          00:00:09       Ben Greenfield is gentlemen and Robo. So it's been a lot of fun hanging out with you for the last 44 minutes. A sick game you out. Yeah, it's pretty fun, right? I need to build a really, really big like 67 yard long living room to, to put my big screen in now. Yeah. That thing is crazy. This, we're talking about this game called techno hunt that were just so, dude, you, you are an interesting fucking guy. You do a lot of weird shit. I would no, thank you. I think, yeah, no, it's good. Yes. It's a compliment when I say yeah, interesting is a good thing. But your, um, like your background, you were just telling me this is very fascinating. Like you, you live way the fuck out in the middle of nowhere. Well, it's Kinda, it's Kinda, I mean it's spokane, spokane, ha. I mean we have like a theater.

Speaker 1:          00:00:52       You're off the grid and we have restaurants. They're actual people there who restaurants. Yeah. And there's a theater there. There's a little five and dime store. At a general store, a spoke cans, a normal place. It's pretty normal. You're, you're totally off the grid. Well, up at our house we are, you know, we're, we're in solar panels and, well, and the way I have it set up is we eased in power from the local municipal power. But if that goes out then it hits the solar inverters and we're full solar. So then there's that. There's like a battery power in the garage that stores a solar because we're on a, we're on like a north facing slope, so you get sun from 10 to two. So we can't collect a lot of solar, but you stored in the battery. So it's, it's there. So you've gotta be very judicious with your laptop use.

Speaker 1:          00:01:32       Yeah, well we do want to go off the grid. It's a stupid home. So there's, there's no Wifi, there's no bluetooth. So everything's like, it's, it's hardwired metal shoulder, the ethernet cable that's through the whole house because I don't like to have like Wifi signals bouncing around. I just really, I don't feel good. I've always wondered about that. What is that doing to us? Well, apparently I just actually just read, there's a, there's a really good new book that came out is called like that the non tin foil hat guide to Emf I think is, is the full title of the book. But it goes into this idea of what are called voltage gated calcium channels on your cell membrane and all those actually get affected by Wifi. And apparently you see like a, like a change in the electro chemical balance across the actual membrane in response to things like Wifi.

Speaker 1:          00:02:18       Apparently Bluetooth affects red blood cells and I haven't seen, I haven't seen a lot of like actual, you know, in Vivo research on that. But I know that I feel better when I don't have like the Wifi router going or, you know, I, I turn off all my, all, everything at night. There's kill switches and all the bedrooms. So it's bait. You walk into the house and it's just super clean. Oh, everything's HEPA air filters, negative ion generators, no Wifi, no bluetooth. We structure all the water that comes in from the, well, so it's the same now, Scott like that. Uh, have you heard of structured water before? I just heard about it because Eddie Bravo just got that installed in his jet. It's kind of cool. I mean the idea behind it, there's this, this cat up at University of Washington named doctor Gerald and he has done this research that shows like in plants or vessels like blood vessels for example, there's an exclusion zone of water.

Speaker 1:          00:03:09       I mean there's like a positive charge on the inside and a negative charge on the outside and that might be backwards. It might be positive on the outside, negative on the inside. But either either way it causes fluid to move through vessels in a way that allows it to move more easily. Like, like the water is actually charged. So apparently when you drink structured water hydrates the sell a little bit better, Huh? Yeah, it sounds like, and that's, that's apparently how, how water moves through plants. That's one of those things that you hear and then like you talked to a scientist and they go, no. Yeah. And they get mad. Well, I interviewed that, I interviewed that guy, Gerald Pollack. And he has compare basically what he's compared to like how it moves in, in glass tubes and how can you structure it and you watch it like the water moves up through the glass tube way, way better.

Speaker 1:          00:03:54       And then I interviewed this guy, uh, Thomas Cowan and he talks about how the heart is not really a pump or it doesn't act as much like a pump as we're led to believe. And so if you, if you drink structured water, apparently the blood moves better through the vessels. So I haven't seen a ton of research on it, but I structured my water just in, cause it's cheap. It's like a, it's like this tiny little like plastic piece that you put on on your, on your water. What exactly is it doing? So the water passes through a series of glass beads like vortex is it? So after it. So it comes out of my, well and I've got, I tested my water and I've got a like a bacteria based iron and high levels of manganese. Like, I thought, well water was just all like pristine, clear, like, you know, like if you drink out of a spring on top of a mountain, but, uh, apparently there's, there's crap in the well water.

Speaker 1:          00:04:44       So I filter it and then after it all filters, it passes through the structured water filter. I would ask that you would get some stuff in the water because if somewhere along the line there's like a dead animal or beaver fever. Yeah. Was dead animals all over my head, just piled everywhere. Carcasses. Careful not, but well then the other thing is like what I get concerned about is, you know, you see like glyphosate and herbicides and pesticides, they get spread over the crops and I live in farmland territory, right? So I'm on this north facing slope and there's all like these farms above me. So I figure if that's dropping down through the ground into that water, I might be getting some of it. So I filter. Yeah, that totally makes sense. I know a guy who got bone cancer because he lived off of a golf course and uh, the golf course is constantly spraying stuff on the golf course and it got into the water supply and a bunch of powder.

Speaker 1:          00:05:34       They select getting bone cancer. Oh really? Like it happened to more people at a ton of people in the neighborhood got cancer. Wow. Yeah, that's scary. Sharese know what I tell people is um, like people who don't have a well and you just live off the municipal water supplies. You use a reverse osmosis water filter cause it's a really, really fine filtration but it takes everything out. Like it takes the bad stuff and the good stuff out. So you want to add minerals back in after you filter the water. So you get a reverse and you could buy these on like Amazon. So like a reverse osmosis filter with what's called re mineralization or you can just use reverse osmosis and then use like trace liquid minerals or you know, sea salt or anything else to add electrolytes back into. A lot of people will put like a pinch of Himalayan salt.

Speaker 1:          00:06:13       I go through so much salt. I use this, this stuff called Mexican Salt Kalema salt. I have in my, I was actually at a steak house last night. People make fun of me cause I pulled up my big white bag of salt and I just sprinkle it on everything. But I'm a, I'm a fiend for salt. I love salt. It's very good for you. And unfortunately there's been a terrible myth. It's been perpetrated a long time ago. That song gives you high blood pressure and it kills you. And that's a, that's a real tragedy because that's one of those ones that it was, it was spread in like probably, what was it, the sixties or seventies when they started telling people that salt causes high blood pressure and no clue. People still repeated today and they don't understand that it's an essential mineral. Well there's a, there's a new book out about this.

Speaker 1:          00:06:52       I forget the name of the book about something. Have you heard of this book? I've heard of the book, but I don't know the name, but it depends too because um, I used to do racing 14 timex. I used to these iron man triathlons and they'd bring people in to test us and they would do sweat sodium analyses where you actually get a patch put on your skin and it measures the amount of sodium released over x surface area of skin. And then there's an algorithm that terms like how much total sweat you lose say per hour during exercise and, and some people lose a copious amount of sodium in their sweat and some lose barely any at all. So you have like a sodium conservation mechanism that differs from person to person. So there might be some people who store salt really well who might actually get higher blood pressure if they, if they consume a lot of salt.

Speaker 1:          00:07:33       So if you're in a massive excess of salt and your time, and my numbers were off the charts though in terms of how much sodium was I was losing, which is probably why it feels so good. Well that makes sense. So you're sweating so much, right? I mean it's just going right through your body now going to, it tastes amazing. Yeah, I'm happy to die of high blood pressure just because of this salt. Just a big fan. I love kosher so I used to at least to pay it and they pay like Roman soldiers and sure. And so I don't, if we went to war for salt, I take salt. I mean it's really kind of amazing. Then it was just less than a 200 years ago that they figured out how to like make refrigerators and I mean as a frigerator from the 1930s I think it was when, when did they first invent those things and then before that they had ice boxes.

Speaker 1:          00:08:12       You'd have to get a chunk of ice from somewhere, right. Have to get me to store stuff. And before that they just use salt. And I've heard, I don't know if this is true, but I heard that if you come from an area, like if your ancestry is from an area where they did a lot of that fermenting, pickling, curing, salting, that you have more robust sodium loss mechanisms like which would make sense for me. Like I'm northern European heritage. I did a lot of like pickling, salting, curing. So I would lose more salt than somebody who might've come from let's say like a sub Saharan African or South East Asian or somewhere where they might not have been using so much salt. Yeah, that totally makes sense. Yeah. So this Wifi thing, I want to go back to that. Um, cause I've always wondered there's, there's not a long history of use of human use of Wifi.

Speaker 1:          00:08:58       And one of the things sounds so stem cells, we're talking about a lot, a lot of studies on that other 90 year old dad is running around. They've been doing himself, right, exactly. Yeah. But the Wifi, like when it sounds hippy dippy, but if you go somewhere like Prince of Wales, Alaska and you're on a mountain top, it feels different. Oh it totally does. No radio. There's no Wifi, there's no direct TV's getting to you. There's nothing and that fee, it feels different up there. You're also, I mean like your grounding and earthing, right. And you're, you're uh, you're breathing a lot more negative ions cause you're outside in the fresh air. And we don't have all the emails jumping out from your inbox. There's, there's a lot of confounding variables. But I mean, all I know and I test a, you're, you're retested heart rate variability.

Speaker 1:          00:09:45       No, it gets the, um, do you know what that is? HRV. A lot of athletes use it, but I don't know much about what does it miss the Inter beat individuality, like the variation in the amount of time in between each beat of your heart. So it's not like how fast your heart is beating and how much time is in between each heartbeat. So you can measure that and you're supposed to have like slight beat to beat variation in how much time is between each heartbeat. And if you have that, that's high heart rate variability. So you can use that to track your readiness to train your recovery. Right. So I use, I use like a ring like this or I'll do like a heart rate strap in the morning. So aura or a ring actually, have you heard of this thing? No, but do just going out of my a cracker jack box.

Speaker 1:          00:10:28       It's a, it's a power. It's a power ring. So mood ring. I've seen one of those, someone, someone sent me something, they don't just use rings, right? There's like other methods of measuring it as well. Or like you can use a bluetooth enabled heart rate monitor strap. That's what it, that's what I used to do is you wake up in the morning, you put on the stopping and test your heart rate variability and it tells you, you know, if it's low you might say, okay well today is going to be like a a yoga day or an easy swim or walk in the sunshine and if it's high then that would be a day where you'll do like kettle bell training or a wad or whatever is it you're going to do. And then the other thing you could use it for is if you, you'll sometimes purposefully get it low, like have some athletes that I train where we'll work them into a state where they've got really low heart rate variability.

Speaker 1:          00:11:10       And then what happens is you taper, right? Like you recover, you rest, you super compensate. So you see a bounce back of nervous system recovery. And you can use that to purposefully adjust the training. Yeah. And if you train through a low hrv for too long, you can predict illness. You can predict injury. So it's a cool way to track training and you can even, you can look at, um, there's a high frequency in a low frequency when you're saying you could predict illness and injury meaning meaning like my hrv is low but, but screw it, I'm going to go train anyways. But you do that day after day you get injured. And the weird thing is that you can have no musculoskeletal soreness, right? Cause a lot of time that subsides, you know, delayed onset muscle soreness. You see that disappear after like 48 hours.

Speaker 1:          00:11:51       And if you've crushed yourself like a, we could talk about this letter if you want, but I've been doing a single set to failure or a single set to failure exercises where it's just like a 15 minute long workout, but it's just full on isometrics. As hard as you can go for 60 seconds to two of metrics isometrics. So you're pushing against, it's a, it's like this force plate machine that you push against and you just generate as much force as you can and it ties to your iphone and it alerts you when you've dropped off 60% of what you originally producing at the beginning of the set. And then that's it sets done game over. So you might do deadlift, squat, press overhead, press pull down, and that's the whole workout. And then you're just recovering in between each of those sets. So this plate, I mean how you doing a dead lift with a plate?

Speaker 1:          00:12:33       It's a force plate. So for example, you're standing in Ohio like a bar, okay. That you're holding onto and the bar is attached to the force plate via two stands on either like two pillars on either side of the bar and you pull the bar and then the force plate detects how much force you're polling and what positions. Let's say you're standing on top of the force plate, you're supposed to choose the hardest position of each exercise. So like half, if I'm, if I'm bench pressing, it's like my elbows are slightly bent. Just near the top or a squatting. It's like the knees are bent that about 30 40 degrees. So, so you get into that position, then you generate as much force as possible for 60 seconds or not. When I first did it, I was at 30 seconds, now I can go a little bit over a minute where I can continue to generate as much force as possible before it drops off to just 60% of what I was originally produced.

Speaker 1:          00:13:21       It's a, it's a cool, efficient way to train, but you don't get that sore afterwards. Right? So musculoskeletal soreness is not a good indicator of recovery in many cases. And that's where this hrv thing comes in is your nervous system, right? Your central nervous system, your neuromuscular system can be really beat up after a workout even if the soreness has subsided. So that's where you use something like hrv and you can say, okay, well I'm not sore but my hrv is still low. So this is going to be an easy day for me. I'm sorry to act like a moron, but explain that one more session. So if your um, if your body is not sore but your hrv is low, it's, what is it showing? What's an indication of? So if your body is not sore but your hrv is low, Hrv is measuring your nervous system recovery.

Speaker 1:          00:14:03       Right? So, so you might not be fully recovered. So what I'm saying it's like musculoskeletal soreness or discomfort is not necessarily the best indicator of whether you're fully recovered. You have to test the nervous system too. That's so weird. That's what I'm hearing. Someone that can edit jarvey measurement comes in and and coming full circle. I've noticed when I do those morning measurements and I'm traveling or I've got the Wifi enabled at my house, my hrv is low so it's affecting my nervous system somehow is the why do you think the Wifi is a mind fuck. Do you think it's really doing something too? I think is doing something but then there's in this room there's the placebo effect. I feel it. I feel real say that's trying to feel it. That's why you're a moron right now. You've got the Wifi going, what's going on Jamie?

Speaker 1:          00:14:45       What do you got the hrv off of my eye. Oh you just t what'd you use? The fingertip. My Apple Watch the Apple Watch tests. Your hrv. So it's been doing it for the whole time I've had it on, but it's paradoxical because the apple watch is making Wifi so it's so confusing. Yeah, no, that's what I was talking about. This, this ring, uh, bought this in Finland like three years ago because I wanted like a body tracking device. I want to track my hrv and I want to track my sleep cycles. But I don't like sleeping all night cause like I sleep with my kind of like my hand tucked down by my Dick, you know, like in, in, by my cry. I don't want something just like sleep like this. I kinda, I sleep on my side, my hands tucked underneath me and there and lily would be like, my right hand is right down around my bowls basically while I'm sleeping and I didn't want something just like blasting me.

Speaker 1:          00:15:34       That makes sense. Sleeping. So cause it was, if it was on my wrist or on my finger or wherever. So this has like a built in computer and you can put it in airplane mode and it'll still collect all the hrv data and everything else. Then when you want to take it out of airplane mode and sync it to your phone and upload all your sleep data or your hrv data or anything else, you can do it. So, so that's, that's why I wear this ring instead of like a fitbit or jawbone or, or, or Jamie's stupid Apple Watch. I never know whether or not being ridiculous with this stuff. Like with worrying about phones being a man like, but cancer, you know, cause it's somebody, some dude told me that once that he got cancer, I think it was testing the cancer side and the guy was saying, do you keep your phone in your right pocket?

Speaker 1:          00:16:14       He's, I guess I do. The doctor was telling him that. I was like, how the fuck does the doctor know? Like this is not proven stuff. This is all real speculation, right? I mean it's tricky because, I mean you can say about the bone cancer on the golf course, right. But, but a lot of people that, I think there's a class action lawsuit it there, cause I think they tested the water and there was whatever the fuck the stuff that they use for fertilizer or pesticides. That's what I was telling you. I was concerned about the, the Dick cancer thing because those stem cells like a stem cells into your Dick. Well, for the past three, so men's health magazine just had me write this article called New Year New Dick where they have me, I'm sorry. So you get them. It's got a, it's the issue with Marky Mark Wahlberg on the [inaudible] on the cover.

Speaker 1:          00:16:56       How appropriate. Yeah. Yeah. Like how to make a small Dick Bigger. Right. But marky mark on the, on the cover and now he can, he can beat me with his, with his four foot tall. Fisticuffs uh, anyways though. So they have me go around and doing everything that I could do to enhance sexual performance or increase the size of your deck or increased blood flow or increased orgasm quality or you know, they just wanted to find out where everything from like fricking gas station, Dick Pills to which by the way, those things do not have it. And then what they say they have in them. What do you think? So, so they, you know, they say like epimedium and your role come a long jack and they're really horny goat weed Algebra. Yeah. It's basically for consult benefil right. The active ingredient in Cialis or Viagra and then a, a Phaedra and copious amounts of caffeine.

Speaker 1:          00:17:41       So I would take these things and just a little, I feel like my head was gonna explode. I mean it's, it's like drinking 10 cups of coffee. Yeah. We have a, a friend of ours who predicted accurately that Jon Jones was taken those things when he pissed hot cause he was like, those things have everything in them. And he's like a John Jones does coke. He goes, I guarantee he's taken dick pills actually entertaining to read because it's all like the like, it's like arena, Chinese fortune cookie, right? Maximum Potency Vigara and everything's spelled wrong. Uh, but the, uh, so they have me doing that. They did analysis of the ingredients. Did you actually get it tested? No, no. We, we went to all these labs. They wouldn't let us actually test, but apparently the FDA has tested them. And if you go to the fda.gov website, they have like these, these warnings out about the actual ingredient.

Speaker 1:          00:18:26       We took, the five that they had warnings about and tested them and the day and day, um, yeah, you don't feel well. You feel like your head's gonna explode and your hands get all cold and clammy. And some of them say, I don't know why, but they say to take them in the morning. Right. Which doesn't to me makes sense. But you take him in the morning and so you just feel completely screwed up like the whole morning. It's like you're just mainlining coffee. So they did that. They did. Um, have you heard of this? Like acoustic sound wave therapy for your Dick. I'm serious. So you're going to answer, no, no, I haven't said this. This is a clinic in Florida. It was called gainswave and you'd go down to Florida. We go down there and uh, and I walk in and the first thing they do is they hand me this like syringe full of the numbing cream and I'm supposed to just like put it everywhere.

Speaker 1:          00:19:10       And so I, I smeared it, you know, my balls, my like I just went everywhere cause I didn't really know what they were, what they were going to do and I wanted, I want it all, all shields activated going to go to, into this thing. So I walk into the room and, and my Dick's all numb. They had me lay down and so my legs are splayed. I'm on this exam room table and this gal comes in and she's got like this giant won attached to a machine and they do this for women too by the way. They put like a condom on the end of it and, and she just basically goes to town for like 20 minutes. Like a Jackhammer was like everywhere around 20 minutes supposedly. Yeah. Supposedly it breaks open old blood vessels and builds new blood vessels and once the numbing cream wears off you're supposed to to perform a lot better.

Speaker 1:          00:19:53       And then they combine this, you know how we were, we were talking about like with your shoulder if you inject it you should do like electro stammer vibration or something to get the injection deeper into the tissue. So you think same thing with this, they do the PRP. So they do prp into your deck and then they followed up and you get, you get a nerve block first. I actually, I thought, I don't know why I thought they put the needle just like right in the pee hole, which to me made sense but it doesn't really, I mean you want it in the actual tips. So they actually go like up where the dick attaches like the tissue at the top, two nerve blocks on either side and then the prp and later on, like a couple months later, the Hemi do stem cells. They actually extracted like four months later from my back and we did a stem cell injection.

Speaker 1:          00:20:35       But this acoustic sound wave therapy, uh, with the PRP, like it wears off and you literally just like get boners all the time, like, like all night long for like a month. So the acoustic sound therapy's supposed to be breaking up. Blood vessel breaks open old board vessels, gainswave procedure breaks up plaque formation in blood vessels and stimulates the growth of new blood vessels in the penis, low intensity extra Kapore iol shockwave therapy. That's going to sell a lot of, uh, of procedures. I like the drawing we shot before and after. Before your veins real tired. Yeah, before it looks like, like an old hunched over man. Then all of a sudden vigor. It looks like a bodybuilding saying. Yeah, I used to do bodybuilding. So is that horrible sport? Do you think it's real? Do you think that's really doing something? I have worked for me and I worked for me in the, um, so yeah, the, the gas station, Dick Pills, they do the acoustic sound wave therapy, but the [inaudible] injections, they had me do like the, uh, knowledge stem cells with about stem cells, stem cells.

Speaker 1:          00:21:37       But that mean that not everybody's going to be able to do that, but that was the best bar. None. Like they, so I went down to Florida and again, Florida, I don't know what I think is cause all the old people live in Florida. Like Dale, all the people like hunched over the steering wheel is there, but all the guys have great Dick's. They can't drive. They have their blinker on for like two miles before they turn, but their dicks are primed. So the, um, the stem cell thing was that the US stem cell clinic in Florida and I went in there and they extract all the fat for me. They took the fat on my back. And what they do is they, they have, um, it's called an enzymatic process where they use something that breaks down the Collagen in the fat and then they have the stem cells that get separated from the fat.

Speaker 1:          00:22:27       And apparently it's a very, very high in these angiogenic like, like vascular vessel building, uh, compounds. And so then you get that it, it's high in the, um, Mesenchymal, the MSC, the MSC cells, which, which are supposedly the very good ones to inject in. So I injected those, um, or I had a doctor in spokane, so they shipped him to spokane on ice and they show up at my house at like 7:00 AM right. Because you got to get them delivered the same day. And then I had my appointment at the doctor at 9:00 AM and I went to the doctor and you know, very, it was like Deja Vu from Florida. Like I go and do the, do the numbing. Yeah, no, no, you're going to do this. Oh yeah. I called him and I want it was kind of friends with the doctor. Yeah. Yeah. There's a picture, I think there's a picture of him in the mega, cause they put all sorts of crazy pictures in the magazine because they haven't given like infrared light on my balls.

Speaker 1:          00:23:14       And I have look this big thing called the [inaudible] that they had me standing in front of every day. Like I Jack my light, I'll tell you about the stem cells and I'll tell you what's the chance that, because it's crazy. Um, so the uh, the stem cells, I went to this doctor in spokane and he injected these, these stem cells from my fat after they've grown for like several in this case, I think they were down there for like eight weeks, but I mean they, they can do same day injections. But for me, I didn't have enough fat cause for me it was right in the middle of, I raced professionally and also of course racing. So I'm just like lean as hell as I go in there. So they could, they could barely get enough fat, so they had to grow them for a longer period of time.

Speaker 1:          00:23:53       A lot of times they can inject same day. So I went into spokane, uh, at this clinic and Spokane, La, new integrative clinic. It's like this osteopathic medical clinic with all these, you know, nice receptionist when you walk in the door. And this, this, this doctor who, uh, he's done stem cell injections before, but he never actually injected them into someone's deck. So it was kinda like the Guinea pig for this. Do you have to explain to him what areas you're supposed to do? He researched it and I think he actually talked to the folks at the stem cell clinic beforehand and make sure that they were on the, on the same page. Then when I fly all the way back down to Florida, it's super inconvenient and it's just a deck, right? They'll make more Sunday. They're growing kidneys and ears. They'll grow Dick Someday. So I'm, so I got an injected and that was, um, uh, first of all look like it got like run over by a semi truck for like two days. It was like all black and blue or the injection you serve was, yeah, yeah, yeah. I'd be super nervous. Like, what do we got infected? It could've gotten infected.

Speaker 1:          00:24:52       Cancer. I've had Marissa and I would not wish Murcia on your Dick. I need get mercy a triathlon. I, I got it. This was at though at the wildflower triathlon, like coming back, my flight got delayed and I was covering all these kids like an off road triathlon and I had all these scrapes and wounds and I think, I think my layover was in Vegas, I don't remember where, but I had to check into hotel flight got delayed and I slept in this hotel room that I swear like there must've been something on the bed cause within a few days like it was all, you know, it gets all nasty and cakey and then it was eating a whole, I wrote a whole blog post about this on my website and they see, you can see, pull up the hole in the back of my leg. It's nasty, scares the shit out of him.

Speaker 1:          00:25:31       Just, just search for like Ben Greenfield staff and, and you'll see the pictures. But it was eating a whole in the back of my leg and my, my kids' role now, once a week. And I buy on, I get the, the defense soap from on it and as soon as they come, as soon as they come back in the door, I'd, I'd have them go into the shower upstairs and defense and race down. Yeah. They sent a bunch of different wipes and stuff for people that train in a place that doesn't have a, a shower. Yeah. You gotta be careful that end, uh, thieves essential oil. Like it's like going to a whole bunch of companies make this version of essential oil called thieves. It's like clove and roads named after these thieves who apparently never got clove cinnamon, Eucalyptus, which is really good for staff and Rosemay.

Speaker 1:          00:26:10       It's actually named that there's like the story of like these four thieves that apparently traveled around the world and they would rob Holmes and, and uh, and they never got sick. Like that's basically the story. I'm sure this was, this was some board table at a, at a multilevel marketing essential oils company. Somebody came up with this story or it could be true. I don't know. But the um, yeah, the, the stem cells into the Dick that, that was an interesting one, but it did. Um, I think from what I can tell, looking in the mirror, it got bigger. I'm pretty, how much? So half inch. Oh, like maybe that much, like enough to tell and my erections got bigger and my orgasms got a lot better for how long they, they're still like that still. Yeah. So it fits. So I think the stem cell, it's kind of like stick with you.

Speaker 1:          00:26:57       Um, well last week I got them, I told you I'm training for the RKC Kettlebell cert and I was doing the, the hundred reps in five minutes snatch test with a, with a one and a half food. And I felt something just go, I was at 84 reps and I felt something go in my back and I got stem cells injected all up and down my ql, my multifidus, my rector spinae into my so ass. But then they also sent them to me, to my house and I did that same vat sell the stuff that's rich and the Mesenchymal stem cells into the bloodstream. So I did a push ivy into the bloodstream. That's the one that you would have to go out of the country to do a, normally you're not supposed to do that. Like that's tech. It's technically not legal for someone to inject you with your own stem cells into your bloodstream.

Speaker 1:          00:27:43       But if you get your stem cells extracted and they're stored and they send them to you, you can technically inject them. If you do it yourself where you're like, have a friend who's a nurse or whatever and you, it's literally just like a push ivy. It was like 30 seconds. We, we caught it on video for a men's health films, so they'll publish a video at some point. But I was super nervous because it's like a few thousand dollars worth of stem cells that, you know, I'm, I'm trying to hit the vein and make sure that they go in the right way and inject. It's a very, very small amount. What you had to be the most nervous getting them shut in your Dick though. No, I was kinda nervous. Yeah. Yeah. That's super experimental. I do a lot of that though. I mean like that. That's kind of my shtick.

Speaker 1:          00:28:21       Like I do a lot of immersive journalism, a lot of self experimentation and a lot of a lot of Guinea pig type stuff. Uh, and I'm, I'm not dead yet and I still have my deck so I, you look great. I'm happy. Yeah. Thank you. Look very healthy. I'm 22 I'm actually, oh yeah, that's, is that, yeah. Is that, that's one of them. That is, yeah. That's an image from my website that's not as deep as it got. I don't think that's the worst photo. The worst one I've ever seen. He's Kevin randomness stuff it with iodine. Like they have you got a sore? No, they have like these long iodine strips when you get the [inaudible] and it's like it's flesh eating bacteria. Yeah, that's me too. And they stuffed see that hole in the middle. They stuff like iodine. It's like a stick in there, like a strip that has, but they literally stuffed it in there and you can feel it.

Speaker 1:          00:29:05       You got, you were telling me you got dry needling done and you know like that weird pressure. It's not like pain, but it's like a weird pressure from dry needling. This is like that except pain, right? Like it's both the pain and the PR. It was horrible, horrible. Like I've had some falls and [inaudible] staff in their leg where they have like all small golf ball size holding their leg and they literally had a packet full of that kind of gauze covering. I don't like how you say a small golf golf balls, a big hole for the back of the leg golf ball, but it's like smaller than a golf ball or go large marble. Any hole in the back of the leg. And my opinion is too big I've ever seen. It's Kevin Randleman. See if he could find Kevin randleman staff. He had open holes.

Speaker 1:          00:29:43       We could see his muscle structure under his armpit. It was horrific. Gosh, he would, he never really recovered. He was dying. He died. He died young from that. Who knows what he died from. But look at the whole, I think I still have it. Oh my gosh. Yeah. That's uh, that's his muscle tissue around it. What body part is that? That's his underarm. Oh my goodness. Oh my goodness. Yeah. That's how bad it was. That looks like he got shot. He does. Yeah. He was rotting away. And I don't know if he didn't treat it quickly enough or I don't know if it was just really aggressive, but it's a real common thing in gyms. And then once you get it, it stays with you. Like it stays in your bloodstream. Like I still, like I have an essential oil diffuser on my desk and I put thieves in it everyday and I just diffuse essential oils in the air while I'm working into the, yeah, it's like a nebulizing essential oil diffuser and I just, just, just to play it safe.

Speaker 1:          00:30:34       Right. I just want to be breathing that in one day, just in case. Fuck. That's, um, and that's the other thing is I stand in front of this light, this infrared light, and this is that Dick Light. Yes. It's called a Jew. And, um, so it, they've, they've done these studies on testicular and sperm production and they've found that there's a wavelength that's like 600 to 800 nanometers wavelength of light that if you expose the testicles to that for five to 20 minutes a day, it's based on this concept of photo biomodulation. So I originally got into this whole photo biomodulation thing when this company, cause I, cause I blog and people just send me these weird things to my doorstep to, to try and they sent me this like nasal probe that you put up your nose and it's got like a helmet on it.

Speaker 1:          00:31:20       You could, you could look it up Jamie, if you want us, call them, uh, via light. And it produces this light that supposedly activates a part of your metrics. So you have like your electron transport chain in your Mitochondria and there's a part of that called the cytochrome c oxidase and it apparently activates more activity in the cytochrome c oxidase to produce more ATP in this case in neural tissue. Cause you have it on your head. And they were using this in dementia and in Alzheimer's patients. But it turns out it's almost like a, like a nootropic for your head. Yes. That's me at my desk back, back when I was back when I was a young Chinese woman, my desk, um, up your nose on your head. I like how that guy is just like looking pensively it's cross rate of the well and she's reading a book like he's reading twilight.

Speaker 1:          00:32:02       That's what I originally did. They sent me just the nose one and I felt shorted because a, they had like the full head. So ask him for the full head one and fucking weird and you can feel like Holtz it. And uh, and uh, what's the um, it was I think it was MPR. It was either radio lab or um, let's see. Other science when the end, I think it think it might be radiolab. They did a study on that or a, or a story unlike this 10 to 40 hertz frequency know, talked about us. That's tdcs oh nine volts trans stimulation. I have one of those to the Trans direct cranial stimulation, that halo device that you wear before a workout and use that thing. No one at a time, one at a time. So this photo biomodulation I'm putting this thing, you know the probe in my ear and you're not even supposed to use it too much because it produces so much atp that if you amp up cellular activity in neural tissue too much, you produced too many reactive oxygen species.

Speaker 1:          00:32:54       Like that's a byproduct of cellular metabolism. It's just like if you eat too much, you produce a lot of byproduct of making energy and that's why it's one of the reasons why fasting is good for you. Like it cleans up the system and you don't make as many free radicals. The same reason like Ketosis is good for you, right? You're not burning as much glucose, you don't produce as many free radicals. Same concept with this. You don't want to use it all the time because you get too much activity. You produce too many free radicals are too many reactive oxygen species, but every other day use it. So New Year, new you, new Dick. How often did you, well, this is from my head and I, and this was like a couple of years ago, same thing a couple of years, and it was like a cup of coffee for my brain. Like every time I'd wake up, I put this thing out when I'm working at my desk.

Speaker 1:          00:33:32       So then, um, this company that makes these lights that are very similar, activate cytochrome c oxidase, activates a release of nitric oxide. But if you do it on your testicles, specifically the cell that it works on is the Leydig cells in the testes, which are responsible for producing testosterone. So you're basically stimulating the leydig cells in the testes the same way that you'd stimulate like neural tissue using this one for your head. So I'd had success with the thing for my head. So I tried this one for the balls and the Dick. And what I did was I would just Jack my pants down for five to 20 minutes a day while I'm saying that, what? Yeah, I'm diffusing my essential oils that I got to pick on my head. And, um, and it works like you actually get more blood flow. I mean, I, I didn't do a control study just pulling my pants down and standing there for five to 20 minutes south.

Speaker 1:          00:34:17       It without the light on. I should, I should do that at some point. Cause maybe it's just like the whole, you know, it's like supposedly going combat style is supposed to be good for your Dick to combat style. So there's you, that's me balls out. I'm standing on standing on my wobble board. I got my ball of light and um, that's actually not my office. I wasn't one of my friend's houses cause he had one. And uh, anyways, uh, and um, obviously I'm not naked, but normally I would, I would, I would be nude and uh, yeah. And, and you just basically new your balls. Yeah. And it's like a warm teddy bear. Increased vascularity, better size, better orgasms. I mean like, like all this stuff. It seemed to have a, so all of this stuff seems to make your day had some kind of where it had some kind of an effect.

Speaker 1:          00:35:00       Yeah. So, um, PRP injections, acoustic sound wave therapy, stem cells, the infrared light, a gas station, Dick Pills. And that's the one I would not repeat. Um, and then they had me do some ayurvedic stuff, like the no ejaculation thing. We just kind of like where, where Tantra have sex. But you pull out the river like the uh, it's a book, it's called the the multiorgasmic men. So I read that and learned how to like, you know, pull back, like, like not actually orgasm and you're like pull it inside and then you finish up and you're just like pissed off the rest of the day. He tell he can't sleep at night because you're all, you're just thought why? So you could see how it would work. But for me it's like I got kids and my wife and I sneak away to get it on. Like I wanna I want, I want the full meal deal.

Speaker 1:          00:35:42       So I didn't like that. The, the no ejaculate reverse orgasm thing. But it's supposed to do like when you internalize the orgasm, when you keep it inside. So this is all based on Chinese medicine principles. Like your, I think it's called your gin or your Djing or something like that, but you have this, this energy, you know, your, your ci or your Pronto, your Chakra, your life force. And apparently orgasming is an in and coming like ejaculating is supposedly one of the ways that you give some of that life force away. Like you release some of your vitality and by having sex but then not coming, you're actually creating that same hormonal response of oxytocin and testosterone and all these things that we release when we're having sex. One way ejaculate, but without actually giving up that, that vitality, that life force there was even like I found, I found like a tables were like based on your age, there's a certain frequency with which you're supposed to ejaculate.

Speaker 1:          00:36:41       Like, like the younger you are, it's like every two days, every three days. And the older you get, like it gets to a certain point where you're like 70 years old and it's like every, every month or something like that. And so it's, it's, it's kind of interesting. But again, I don't, I don't like that. Like I want, I want, I want to finish. But again, preconceived prejudice that you have though. Like a wonder if you just went into it like completely objectively would have some sort of a benefit. Uh, or maybe you'd just get like mineral depleted and you lose all your zinc and everything else you need to make sperm and you'll start to cramp up. I Dunno. To me, you'd have to be ejaculate in a lot, I think. So when you were doing all these different things, how much of a time, like how much of a buffer did you give yourself in between each thing?

Speaker 1:          00:37:20       So it was not a well controlled experiment at all. It was like three months. It's just like, Hey, do that. Hey, why don't we try this? Let's say, hey, the articles coming out soon, we should toss this in there too. So they probably compounded, it was not a well controlled experiment and I did a lot over three months. Like it would have been a lot better and just try one thing at a time. But I, but I, but I am well hung and very vascular now. Credulous will experiment. So, so there's that. Um, so yeah, it's called New Year, so new year, new deck. And it really did make your Dick Bigger. So do you think there's any help out hope out there? Asking for a friend, guys who have microdex micro, what's a micro Dick [inaudible] small penis. I would imagine there's whole pantry. They could be like great politicians or influential and that there's gotta be some kind of trade off, right?

Speaker 1:          00:38:03       Like if you, if you have sickle cell anemia, apparently it keep protected from malaria. So maybe if you have a small Dick, it protects you from some kind of horrible accident later on in lighting. So I don't think so. I just wonder like, if there's a way to fix that and people, if maybe this was the way it was. I've always felt like that's gotta be one of the saddest things yet. Um, again, like you never know. There could be a bunch of nine year old man walking around with Dick Cancer 60 years from now who heard this? And I went and got injected. So I will not attest to the safety of it, but kind of test the efficacy of it. Um, so some of those things would work for that. For All those people walking around there. All of your listeners have small dicks gave them salvation.

Speaker 1:          00:38:42       There's old fellows. There's hope. So. So yeah. That's um, is that like you're, you're saying it's still works. Like it's, how long ago did you do this experiment? Oh, I mean like the, the magazine is still on the shelves. Like it just kept going. He said, how long is it was like [inaudible] was like starting, I got the stem cells extracted in August of 2017 so this is like the end of January, eight weeks later I got those shot into the deck and we only made a couple of weeks, months later after they really grow in a lot of these Mesenchymal mesenchymal stem cells. I got them injected into my bloodstream and in the like that injury that I'm fighting in my back right now. Um, and I'd done some other things before that for, for the backend, for tissue like peptides like this, uh, the bpc one 57 that we were just talking about before.

Speaker 1:          00:39:30       Yeah. Yeah. Which is really interesting stuff. I mean, it's not, it's not intended for human consumption, but it's also not banned by water. I mean it's, it's, it actually it's legal to use and it's a peptide. Um, it's called body protection compound bpc one 57, and the one 57 refers to like the sequence of amino acids that makes up the actual compound. But you can buy it and reconstitute it. And then if you inject it into an area, and it doesn't even have to be like a painful intramuscular injection, it can be like a subcutaneous injection. BPC supposedly stimulates angiogenesis and it's an, it's a natural compound. You find it in the human gut. So they took this same thing that helps to heal the human gut, which is why if you were to consume this and drinking water, it supposedly, and this is an in rodent models, it apparently works to like heal up an inflamed gut, Colitis, ibd, ibs, stuff like that.

Speaker 1:          00:40:25       But you can inject it into a joint or subcutaneously into an area around the joint. And it's supposedly stimulates the, uh, I feel like this is a repetitive phrase on this show. The growth of new blood vessels. So angio, angiogenesis, and then there's another one called tb 500 that they use in race horses, the thymus in Beta. That one is banned by water, but same similar principle except that one acts on the actin and myocin fibers and actually causes regeneration of those. So you could do both and he get angiogenesis and then also fiber regrowth. And that, that's, that's a strategy that would be like pennies on the dollar compared to stem cells. And also, you know, a far less, I'm far less intensive procedure in terms of collecting your stem cells. Right? Yeah. And then there's, um, so there's, there's a fat for the stem cells and from what I understand, if you're going after the anti aging effect, like the bone is better like the mirror, like a bone marrow.

Speaker 1:          00:41:19       So I had mine, I had my bone marrow extracted at this place called forever labs in Berkeley, California. And they store that. And then what I can do is I can just inject the 35 year old me into my body every year or every five years or whenever I want to put that back in. So I've got bone marrow and fat marrow stored. So they take the bone marrow and how do they have enough to just keep going? Do they replicate it? I don't know. The protocol that used to grow this stuff, like I know the fat one, they use like a collagenase procedure that enzymatically breaks down the college and from the fat and somehow concentrates the stem cells and you can actually grow them. Like you can actually multiply them. I'm assuming it's something similar for bone and the bone would be more for like longevity and anti aging and in the fat would be more for for joints.

Speaker 1:          00:42:10       I know a lot of people got the bone marrow done for injuries. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And it's supposed to be too painful. Was it painful for you and they extracted the bone? Not compared to the Dick injections. It's all relative. But I, I'm, I've been, I've been obstacle course racing and that was, I was triathlete before that and did body build. So I've always done all this masochistic shit. So getting, I think my pain tolerance is, is, hi Don. Uh, the, the bone marrow, it didn't hurt that much. No, it was that day. They numb it. They go in. Um, the Dick one was where there was like that weird pressure. A little bit of pain. I would say that the iodine packing into the staph infection that you're talking about, that was, that was up there. Daniel Cormier, Yang Ufc light heavyweight champion, had it done with the bone marrow and he was telling me it was painful as hell and he's about as tough name getting a's.

Speaker 1:          00:42:54       I checked it again and just hanging out. So I mean it's, it's a big needle. It was limping around. He said for awhile when I did the stem cell injections, that was cool cause they used, they used a digital thermography. She can, it's like an ultrasound. It's like what you would use to look at a baby. Yeah. But you can't, you can see the tissue, you can see the areas where there's swelling or there's like a black area where, where the tissue is torn up or whether there's a Dema or inflammation and you can and, and um, uh, he showed me the video after he did all the injections. You can see the needle like going into the, you can, you can micro target exactly. Exactly where you want to put the cells. Yeah, I've done it. Very, very cool procedure. Don't want to use that.

Speaker 1:          00:43:31       Cool. Thermography. Yeah. Yeah. It's a cool procedure. Have you ever done Regena keen? No. You're aware of it. You know what it is. It's a, it's one of the things that a lot of pro athletes are going to Germany to get done. It's a, it's a form of platelet rich plasma where the heat it up and by heating up the, uh, the plasma, it produces this radical anti-inflammatory property. It's like they extract it into this yellow serum. They spin it in a centrifuge. So if you're going to get it done, I've had it done on how is that different than just normal prp? More powerful. More poorly because it's it up. Yeah. Cause some PRP before. Yeah. I have as well. Yeah. It's, I mean, obviously I'm not doctor, but, uh, according to these doctors that do it, and there's a place in Santa Monica that does it called lifespan medicine.

Speaker 1:          00:44:13       I've had it done really for the longest time. You had to go to Germany, like Dana white flew to Germany to get it done because it was illegal. They hadn't, yeah, they had an interest, but can go on a, I'm going over to, uh, to, uh, Venice beach. I'm going to be done by there. I'm going to these cats. The uh, that place I was talking about the human garage. That's an interesting place. I really want to talk to the guy who does it. My friend Doctor Ben [inaudible], he is the guy who performed the procedures down there. He's a great guy. He would love to talk to you too. Yeah, sure. Cool. You'd get a kick out of it. It's pretty interesting. Some day I'll run out of stuff so you inject it into joints, but for now, for me it really helped me heal a bulging disc in my neck.

Speaker 1:          00:44:50       Rarely they go right into the spinal cord. It's great for people that have pretty serious neck injuries and back injuries. Have you tried this thing? I think it's, it's pet AECON is a company that makes it, but it's like a neck traction device. I have one hanging him that in a yoga trapeze and so all your hands and you're all hanging by the neck. I do this when I get up, I get up and I put like a bunch of magnesium on my neck and my back to relax all the tissue. And once you get really relaxed and have this, uh, this, this vibrator, it's a, it's like a car buffer for your body so you can vibrate your neck and your back and then you get really, really relaxed and it's perfect for, you know, for like doing your own deep tissue therapy but it, but it vibrate.

Speaker 1:          00:45:31       So I'll do that on my body and I go hang from this neck thing and you get all of these pops up and down in your neck. And I, and it apparently realigns the atlas and the axis and some of the cervical vertebra and there's probably a bunch of chiropractic docs who are, who are, uh, really, uh, pissed off right now because I'm describing this incorrectly. But it, it feels amazing. Like it just adjusts everything. And then I hang from the yoga trapeze and, but when it definitely seems like five minutes. Yeah, definitely. Decompresses your, I don't know about all that other nonsense, but it definitely, it's stretching out those muscles and alleviating some of the stress that comes from bad posture. And for me it was a lot of grappling getting your neck cranked and squished and resisting thing. It's like, um, it's kinda similar to traction and I really been getting into that.

Speaker 1:          00:46:14       Have you heard of [inaudible]? E? L? D? O? H? No, it's like a form of stretching where I actually had a guy come to my house for two days and he stayed in my basement. And the way we wake up, I've done this a few times, we'll have people come over to me and just like teach it. There's, there's another guy who mashes it like use a walker and just like mash up and down your body. And uh, but this is El Della, so l Doa, you'll like push a joint out this way and then out this way and then your feet will be splayed in both directions. There's like 20 different poses that you do, but it's a form of self traction. Right. So it's like, um, it's similar to like if you were to use a monster band to traction a join, have you ever done that?

Speaker 1:          00:46:54       Like traction, you're hip with a real tie, a monster band around your hip and then attach it to I have not potassium and joint apart. Yeah. That's all Doa. Is that Adam from mine pump that is that the mind pump that he, and I think that's my buddy Adam. It says spinal health l. Dot. O. N. E. L. O. D. Yeah. Oh yeah. So that, that's one of the ones I do in the morning. And that's l five s one so that, so they all work on a specific, like part of the back, the part of the body, let me say it again. Eld [inaudible] l five or l five, I forget what it stands for. It was invented by this guy named [inaudible]. Yay. A French guy. And uh, dude, you feel amazing. You, you hold these poses for like a minute and it introduces a bunch of new blood flow to the joint.

Speaker 1:          00:47:39       They see how he's doing that. He'll like put his hand up and traction the Fascia. And so he's getting this intense poll. If you're to do this, you get this intense poll on your back. I do this one cause I get it. I could show it to you after, but you feel amazing. I do this when I wake up now and uh, who knitted this vertical farming stressing this goes back. This is like some, some French guy invented it and uh, I don't remember how I heard about it but, or I uh, uh, interview this guy named Jacob Shawn on my podcast and he taught me all these moves and getting my house and uh, it's, it's another one of those really cool forms of stretching. It's like you do yoga. I have a, uh, of a sauna. You Do, you have do like an infrared sauna.

Speaker 1:          00:48:20       We have a regular sauna. I use, uh, like, uh, like a near far infrared sauna. And I go in there, cause you're, your tissue gets very pliable and hot. So I had a, I had a crane drop a 19 foot and endless pool out in the forest back behind my house. And I keep this thing just like super duper cold, right? So it's like 45, 50 degrees. So that's like my, my cryotherapy cold water immersion. Well during the, during the winter and the fall just stays that cold. I just keep the lid off. And then during the summer when I'm coming back home and I'm going by the gas station up the up the hill before my house, I stopped and I buy ice bags and I just dumped them in there. So it's so it stays relatively cold. And uh, what I do in the mornings when I'm home, as I do this sauna and you asked about yoga, I go in there and this is when I do a lot of this stuff, right?

Speaker 1:          00:49:07       Like I'll do some of my yoga moves, some of my elders. There was another really good form of stretching called core foundation, uh, doc named Eric Goodman. And it's like a form of decompression for the spine. And he works with a lot of athletes, kind of like turns on your glutes decompresses your spine. So I, I just use a mash up of all these little moves and I'll be in my sauna for like 30 minutes. So I'm producing all the, all the heat shock proteins. I'm getting the nitric oxide, get in the blood flow and you just feel, you feel good. We did a sauna, so I get all sweaty and I get kind of, we will sprinkle essential oils in there and I'll burn like Palo Santo incense and you know, put on burn incense inside the song feeds. Yeah, it smells really nice. And again, it's like, yeah, like binaural beats.

Speaker 1:          00:49:52       So there's this, this guy named, um, Michael Tyrrell, and he makes these, these cds and these tracks that you said his name, you load your vote. When Michael Tyrrell retirees, he's amazing tracks and they're, uh, they, they vibrate at specific hertz frequencies right there. So there's this whole idea that like your root Chakra, like your fourth chalky, your heart shock or vibrates it 528 hertz. And there's, there's different hertz frequencies associated with different positive aspects of, of euro. You know, it's this, uh, it's like, uh, uh, a Chakra like oh shit. I mean, have you tried to debunk any of that? I feel really good. I'm trying to, good. If I feel good, I'm going to try to be deep us to do it. Yeah. My notes. Are you doing this with headsets on? No, that song it has like surround speakers and so I just, I play that through the speakers.

Speaker 1:          00:50:38       No Bluetooth and no Wifi. Jay May just like, it's just like my little shitty little ipod shuffle that I plug it and play. And um, so I play that while I'm in the sauna and I'm doing all my moves and then I walk out of my house, go through my office, walked through the forest and I go and jump in the pool and swim in there for like fights, like 50 yards. It's not jumped the other one to the other and no, it's too much to go back and forth. Like I've tried to just, I got to keep things somewhat cause this is getting kind of complex between like the light in the balls and the essential oils. Like you gotta you gotta draw the line somewhere ourselves. Sometimes I'll have friends over and, and we'll vapor will smoke in the sauna and then we'll go out to the pool and then go roll around in the snow.

Speaker 1:          00:51:20       They get back in the pool and go back in the sauna. And My, I do this and my wife is inside making dinner and we just feel amazing. I, we got the hot, we got the cold and then we'd go in and we eat dinner and it's, it's amazing. It's my favorite thing to do with my friends. Wow. But in the morning and do the sauna and the ice and then or there or the cold pool. And then I finished with a quick dip in the hot tub out in the trees cause I put a hot tub next to the cold pool and everything's like super clean. You know, it's cleaned with ozone and minerals instead of chlorine. And so you just feel really, really clean. And I walk in and start my day. I feel like wow. Blocks. So I do yoga. Yeah. But it's in the, it's in the song.

Speaker 1:          00:51:55       Well, it sounds like you're just stretching, you know, doing like the strengthening I do actual like, well what do you mean like standing boyer one warrior two or three like like standing bow pose, head to knee pose. I do strenuous doing like old person yoga. I do that legit shit. I'm not in a questioning. I do a headstand. I'm just wondering what you're doing actually in the sauna. Yeah, I'd make it up as I go. I don't have like, um, I was just based on how you feel while I was speaking in, in code. That's why I'm down here and speak in Costa Mesa and a couple of days ago and there was like this, this banquet dinner as part of the event and I'll sit next to this guy. I'm like, well what do you do for your fitness routine? Et cetera. He does Bikram Yoga every day, but like the Bikram Yoga, like all of the poses that are part of bigger meal because it's a set series of routines.

Speaker 1:          00:52:43       You've done bikram before? Yeah, he has like 90 minutes and he does that every single day at nine days in a row. Yeah. Yeah. No, he's been doing it for like years every day. I'm impressed. Cause we did it. We did sober October, we had to do 15 about a month mean a bunch of my friends. Yeah. I wanted to burn it out. So the last nine days, well I had a few days to go but for nine days I just said let me just get these out of the way. And Yeah, every day I did 90 minutes and it was like wow. But it's interesting because you realize that your body can do that. I don't like to Overdo it though because it's static stretching. We know that that can decrease forced potential. Like it can decrease power production for the calm too pliable, flexible. Isn't that the case though? Preworkout like well the workout, but chronically, if you elongate tissue, and I don't know if they've actually done any studies on people who have done yoga for a really long time and compared like their, their vertical jump right before and after.

Speaker 1:          00:53:38       But I just feel almost too stretchy if I get too into it. Like I feel like when I run it's a little bit more like gumby running versus limiting the amount of here. That's interesting. That's definitely, definitely static stretching prior to force production is not a good idea. Right. Like prior to things like squats or something like that. It was like when the, when the lights went out during the superbowl a few years ago, you remember that. And you could see on TV, both teams were just like standing on the sidelines or setting on the silent doing these long hamstrings, static stretches and Anne and I wondered why they were doing it because they were about to get back in and, and engage in a very powerful explosive sport. So yeah, it's, it's a dynamic stretching. Definitely price prior to force production activities. Yeah. Yeah. I wonder why they're doing, maybe they just have really old school trainers or something like that are not aware or maybe they just doing it on our own before I do that isometric training.

Speaker 1:          00:54:30       Um, for, for power production, I've got two things. I bought this stuff called them those torque on Amazon. You heard this stuff's towards like smelling salts on steroids. No, power lifter told me about it and he would sniff it before he'll go like, you know, rip a 700 pound bar off the ground and you, you snort that, you open up the cap on this stuff and it's just like releasing a wild animal into the room and it released the cap. It's like smelling salts on steroids and you smell and you just want to go kill somebody or find somebody. Yeah. It's called nose, nose torque or knows Turk toward however it's something like that. Like no knows torque. Yeah. Tork Tork yeah, there you go. And so I do that. And then the other one that I just made as you can buy this for like pennies on the dollar on Amazon.

Speaker 1:          00:55:15       Yeah. You can get these essential oil inhalers. So there's some guy just smelled it. Here we go. Yeah. Oh he can't even get it near his face. He's got it. Yeah. Oh, it's, it's hard like gift packs of Bud. Did he just do it or is he getting ready to do it? It's opened it up. It's like smelling. So it's ammonia. So, uh, I don't know chemically like I would imagine it just put your sympathetic nervous system into overdrive when you sniff all that ammonia. [inaudible] he's been really ginger. He's like, Oh, I've got to get some of my friends at restaurants. I carried around some times. Jesus going into a restaurant. I have smelt my bouquets. Actually. You could smell it. Go get it. Um, right now you want to, you want to sniff it right now? All right, let's do it. Alright. Knows torque. It's out in the car. I was in the car. It's an, you know what we'll do, we'll do it after. It'd be boring. Podcasting. Plus if people weren't really want to try it, they can just buy it on Amazon. Um, the other one is up and excites you and allows you to, so they should be on the field doing that before they, uh, I don't know if I would recommend that. You're probably seeing guys like nosebleeds and heart attacks.

Speaker 1:          00:56:20       They, um, the other one is a peppermint. Have you ever used like peppermint oil in it? And they've done studies on this, on peppermint oil and athletic performance. And what I have is this little, uh, it, it looks like a little Tampon or you can buy these on Amazon. They're called aroma therapy inhalers and it's like this little cotton wick and you put it, you put essential oil on the cotton wick, right? So it absorbs into the wic and then you put the cap on and you can carry this around in the gym in your pocket. Or I played tennis on Wednesday night, so I bring it to my tennis matches and while I'm playing tennis, I'll stop sometimes and sniff this thing. Kind of say like awake and alert and do it like it is just peppermint, just peppermint. But it has this amazing effect.

Speaker 1:          00:56:59       It's like this wakefulness promoting effects. Peppermint. Peppermint is amazing. I put like if you get bloating or gas, you can smear that around your, your stomach and it makes it go away. It goes one of my favorite oils to use. Yeah. How it gets absorbed through the skin. I mean, you know, this is skin is skin is a out, but a lot of the internal organs, I don't know if it actually goes into the actual stomach like in like like through the, through the epithelial lining and into the end of the actual intestine. But like it, it has an effect for sure. In terms of what I just started using recently is topical cbd, Topical Cbd and the lack a role on almost like a deal on rent roll on kind of a thing. It's amazing. The CBD, there's a, there's one, um, I used this stuff called bio cbd and it's Tumeric or curcumin with CVD and and yeah, it's same thing.

Speaker 1:          00:57:49       It's like a topical, they also do a thc like thc roll-ons yeah, they do that. Another thing, speaking of the, of the sexual performance thing, you can actually buy like thc, sex lube and I mean it's like a high for your crotch. Literally. You apply it locally and it's like your crotch gets a high and you can do, you can do the same thing with these little uh, coconut oil. THC suppository, while they're not suppository, their demand for swallowing in the mouth. That's a normal route of delivery, but you can shove them up your butt like 30 or 40 minutes before you have sex and you actually get like this amazing high for your crotch. I was just like these thc coconut oil capsules. I just find out about that. Just put it up there. The actual path salts, not bath salts like the drug, but the stuff that you put in the bath now that's thc.

Speaker 1:          00:58:37       Really? Yeah. They're doing everything out here now. It's crazy. They've gotten hogwild because out here like California, Washington, Washington, Washington's liberal. But I'm the guy that I get my stuff from in California. It just started giving me this stuff to put in the bath. Yeah. And he just, he's like, you gotta be careful though because yeah. Way Too high in your bag. I believe it is with skin absorption. Yeah. You're literally like, just like bathing in it like people bay than in wine and these fancy spas. Yeah. What they bathed in wine. You have wine bags? Yeah. There's this place I go to in New York City. Uh, it's called Ra spot, a IRA and they had like one of the options to go there. You can just take a bath and one that sounds so like calligraphy, the wine and a few versions and some feed, make grades.

Speaker 1:          00:59:23       She's taking a drip of this bow is wide. Oh, that's so strange. It's kind of cheesy though. She she looks like a news anchor. Like yeah, it does. Yeah. This is like for, yeah. Oh my gosh. Grapes and there we go. I called it the grapes. You could say yeah, that it's actually a cool spa. I've never done the wine, but it sounds, why, I don't know if you'd get drunk from the wine. I don't know if it would actually wind up in your, in your set, but they use antioxidant rich temper neo grapes. Well how could you not get some sort of absorption? I'm sure you would get something about the sensory deprivation tank is that through the epsom salts, your body absorbs a lot of magnesium. Right? I like the magnesium chloride, like using actual magnesium and said, and I like that cause you can get it for, I mean that's what they used to melt ice.

Speaker 1:          01:00:06       Like you can just buy this stuff like rocks hall. I know you guys don't melt a lot of ice in California, but like in Washington state you can buy magnesium chloride about like a fricking like concrete size bag, know concrete mixed size bag of it. And it's the same stuff that they sell on these expensive websites as like magnesium salts. It's just magnesium chloride and you can dump that into your year, way more magnesium than you get from epsom salts. Well that's really what you want is the magnesium. Like that's displacing the calcium. That's pretty soon the relaxing effect that's, you know, it's, it's, maybe I should add that to my tank magnesium because I've already got themselves first to make sure it's not going to mess up the, is there like a filtration mechanism on the 10 yeah, there's some pretty heavy filtration system, but it filters out the epson salts have an idea for float tanks.

Speaker 1:          01:00:47       You know her my idea of course, because that's where I just get it. I get really bored and float tanks. So yeah, I just said, and I, uh, no, that's the mail going to the edibles. You went out before. I've only done it three times every time in Austin, Texas. And it's always been like I've been on a wife. Yeah. Charlie with a lot of people do with ketamine don't die. That's the, um, the guy who invented it. John Lilly's method. Yeah. I have an edible that I make at home, uh, with, with Kratom, which is an opioid painkiller that's freaking amazing. It induces this euphoria like, hi, and then I add CBD Thc, Copaiba Oil, if you've heard of this. No. Copaiba oil acts on the endocannabinoid receptors very similarly to thc and cbd, but it has what's called like an entourage effect, meaning it enhances the effects of CBD and thc.

Speaker 1:          01:01:40       So like if you're, if you're vaping, you can add like a couple of drops of oil over the top of the herbs, um, or you can mix it into like an edible cakes that you make. Yeah, I saw. Amazing. Wow. My sister accidentally took one last week and said she had the best night of sleep of her life. Really? And uh, I don't travel with them cause they just smell like you just open up a, a what? Bass can full of weed. So it's, you know what, you don't want those in the bouquets when you're traveling dogs. Yeah, exactly. Every time I pull line of dogs, follow me through the airport. We're like Oj Simpson. Anyways though, the um, the, the uh, mix. I use coconut oil and g and dark chocolate and a little bit of Stevia. Like I have this butterscotch toffees Stevia. It's amazing.

Speaker 1:          01:02:24       I travel everywhere. I put it in sparkling water. I put it in coffee. It's like an organic butter, Scotch toffee, Stevia addicted to it. It's a, it's a company called, oh, Micah organics. I actually get it. I get a three pack. O, m I c a I get off Amazon is, was vanilla butterscotch toffee and plane. Like if you just don't want, if you want to sweeten something but you don't want those extra flavors, best best dba. So I put all this in the edible and I have this countertop immersion blender called the, uh, a magical butter machine. And you, you blend this and it blends on top of your counter for like eight hours and all this stuff that makes us together. And then you pour it into molds and you can just put it in the, in the freezer. And then I keep it in these like little Miron glass jars so it doesn't degrade and it's just like the best, best edible.

Speaker 1:          01:03:09       So I should try something before float tanks. Yeah. Returned to my float tank idea. Okay. So I get these ideas when I'm in the float tank and I want to, and usually it's like five or 10 minutes in. So I spend the next 50 minutes trying to remit like, don't forget this, don't forget it. And I try to like these little mnemonic techniques where you imagine like, Eh, you know, the, the, like an image of what you remembered is waiting for you outside the door as soon as you opened the float tank. So it, it might work for you to remember and, but basically it just kind of screws up my whole ability to be able to just like let thoughts come and go and relax. So my idea is this, why not have some kind of a recorder going forward or you thought we made a record and you can get those shit?

Speaker 1:          01:03:53       I was the first one to the wall. No, screw it. I've been doing, okay, so, so like a voice activated recording. Yeah. Do you have one like I never did because, and then you walk out and you just get an MP three play buck. Yeah. Thought of. I, I've been trying to figure out what a good one would be and how to set it up in there with all the salts and not have it degrade. But I think you could figure it out. I mean my thoughts are, I thought is a Velcro, velcro patch. Slap it in when you go in there and then activate it. You ever see those voice activated ones with a red light and seeing voice activated recorders? Yeah. I don't want to break the lie. You super easy. Yeah. Well they make these led. Um, uh, you know, they're, they're like, uh, you know, cause I, when I travel I don't like to get all the blue light and the hotel rooms and I'll unplug things.

Speaker 1:          01:04:38       Try to make the hotel room dark. Right? Cause when you flip off the lights in a hotel room, it's just like fricking Vegas, right? There's blue lights on the TV and stuff flashing all over the place. So they make these, and I had it for awhile. I don't travel with it any more, but it's like a black tape you can put over over things that light up in a room. You're, you, something like that. It's like, uh, uh, you can, uh, they're like led light blockers. It's like tape basically, but you just put it over the cover of anything that lights up. You can use something like that on the digital recorder. Wow. Get to sell this for millions of dollars. Well I think the digital recorded thing is a really good idea and someone needs to, I need to think, and I have my idea. It was not your idea.

Speaker 1:          01:05:19       I thought at first, when did you first start doing it all? I thought it was like two years ago and they had one of them. I've had a tank since 2002 early. Yeah. Yeah, I agree. I raced an ironman triathlon for eight years and just got tons of sensory dep in the water. Just staring at that black line at the bottom of the pool. It's hard for me to just like get in water and relax and not feel like you have to swim or I just, I've never been able to get that relaxed. No, that's interesting. So you associate like water with the movement because associate water with swimming. I like, I get in water and I won it and I love water, right. Like I, I free dive and I spear fish. I read this book, um, deep by James Nest Door, amazing book about all these cool things that going when you go down deep and he talks about how Olympic athletes are using this now to enhance the performance because your spleen compresses and you produce more renewable, eaten more red blood cells.

Speaker 1:          01:06:08       Same thing that you produced. Actually, if you, if you sauna, like if you do a workout and you get really hot and then you go in the sauna after they've done studies on this and they found that 30 minutes of heat therapy after you've already gotten the body hot, you produce hipo the same as if you were to use the performance enhancing drug. It's like, that's interesting because there was a statistic just came out about cryotherapy and this is this echo something that Rhonda Patrick was saying that if you do Cryo, her advice was you should wait at least an hour after a workout before you do it and allow your body to have some sort of effect, uh, from, from the exercise. But Sauna, they're saying you should do almost immediately after. So the, the idea with this, and there was a brand new study that just came out like three days ago where they showed that heat post exercise enhanced the effects of exercise, whereas cold blunted the hormetic response to exercise, which makes sense.

Speaker 1:          01:06:59       It's the same thing side of a window though. It's a window of time. So, so the deal is you don't want to blunt the hermetic response. Sexualized high dose antioxidants, cryotherapy, cold immersion, all of that can do this. That's a problem with but fighters cause a lot of fighters are getting into cold immersion like immediately afterwards. Exactly what you'd want to wait until later on in the day. There's no research on the amount of time. For me what I do it same thing when I do like a hard afternoon and work out a way to couple hours afterwards cause you get a bigger testosterone and growth hormone response when you wait after work out to eat. I was uh, actually actually mark Sisson was the first guy who told me about this and it turns out that there actually is a better hormonal response when you fast post exercise.

Speaker 1:          01:07:42       Same thing with antioxidants and there were a couple of exceptions I can tell you about. Same thing with a cryotherapy, not the same time. If you finish up a hard afternoon or especially like an early evening workout, you have a very high body temperature. So my theory is that a brief dose of cold, like all jump in the cold pool and get out and not if not a phone call, just enough to decrease the core body temperature, which is one of the ways that you enhanced deep sleep cycles. So I also sleep on this thing called the chilly pad that circulates like cold water underneath my body wirelessly start sent me one of those things. And the cool thing is like your partner can put their temperature on and I can put my temperature on and you can, you can sleep or whatever temp you want. So I sleep with this thing as cooking oil at 55 degrees.

Speaker 1:          01:08:25       Yeah, but it's not, it's like background noise cause I sleep with all these binaries and everything. Anyway. I use the strict codes called sleep stream. It's like a Dj for sleep. So I put my phone in airplane mode and then I have these, these noise blocking headphones. And if you're a side sleeper, you can use these things called sleep phones, which is like a headband that goes around your head. Um, anyways though back to the, to the not doing the cold after exercise. So you wait a little while. But I think decreasing the body's core temperature is good. So like a cold shower, cold water immersion also beats out crowd therapy because yeah, it's actually more. And there was a study they did last month on this, that cold water immersion was very effective in reducing postworkout muscle soreness and that inflammatory response to exercise compared to cryotherapy.

Speaker 1:          01:09:09       But again, you should wait a little bit before you do it each way a little bit before you do it. But I think part of that is due to you get like this hydrostatic pressure of water against the skin, right? So it kind of pushes the cold against the skin a little bit better. Uh, and then the other reason is that when your head gets wet, when you're head goes under, you know, same thing as you would get with a cold shower. You get like this Mammalian dive reflex, right? Like that sharp intake of breath and that activates your vagus nerve. So we talked about HRV and heart rate variability tracking. Anytime you do something like that that improves the tone of the Vegas nerve, you would actually improve your ability to recover and improve the strength of your, of your nervous system. And they sell like vagal nerve stimulators and they've looked into like chanting humming a singing, uh, jaw, they call it jaw realignment therapy apparently removes the pressure that the trigeminal nerve can place on the vegas nerve.

Speaker 1:          01:10:02       There's all these things you can do to enhance the health of the vegas nerve and that's one of the things that improve your hrv or your heart rate variability allows your sympathetic and your parasympathetic nervous system tone. Like what do you mean by that? The tone of the nerve? Uh, it would basically be synonymous with like the, the health of the nerve. I don't know what, what's actually, I don't know if it's, if it's changing like the, uh, you know, what, what do you call them? The myelin sheath of the nerve or something like that. When, when you're increasing the tone of the nerve, but more or less, it's healthy for the vegas nerve when you get, when you get your head wet or underwater. So when I go in my cold pool, after workout, I put my head under and then come up like five or 10 times just to go up and down and up and down.

Speaker 1:          01:10:43       Then I get out and if I'm going to do a longer cold soak, it's not right after a workout. The, um, the two studies I found on antioxidant use after workout, right? High dose antioxidants like vitamin C, vitamin E, et Cetera, that's supposedly blunts the hermetic response to exercise. But there was one study that shows that green tea polyphenols don't do that. So green tea would allow you to fight off the inflammatory effects of exercise without blunting. For example, satellite cell proliferation or of new Mitochondria are all of the things that you want to happen. And the other one was a, and this is, this is a new thing, like not a lot of people are talking about this now, but it's like hydrogen rich compounds. Like, they call it hydrogen rich water. And there's these companies now, there's like four or five of them.

Speaker 1:          01:11:29       They sell like these tablets that you can dissolve in water and there's a, uh, the molecular hydrogen foundation, they do research on, on this hydrogen and they're not, they don't have a financial affiliation with any of these companies. So I respect some of the research that they do and they've found that it actually blunts the, or it allows for antiinflammatory and antioxidant effects to shut down, like the inflammatory response to exercise without blunting the hormetic response. So it'd be like green tea and molecular hydrogen would be the two things that I know of that you could do postworkout to blunt that inflammatory response without actually, um, blunting the hormetic response to exercise so it'll enhance without exactly. Exactly. Have your cake and eat it too. One of the things that I think that's probably really good about cold immersion therapy also, I think there's a meditative aspect of getting into that incredible cold and just relaxing and calming.

Speaker 1:          01:12:23       And I think it does something for your mind. It does. And it's the nervous system right? Like what I tell people is you have a strong, and I take my kids out that right. And I've trained them at a very early age to go out there, the jump in the cold pool, but they'll stand in front of the cold pool and calm their nervous system, call them their heart rate. I'll have them visit like one of them visualizes a sea otter, right? And the other one does a polar bear. So, so they'll visualize these animals that are just like impervious to cold, right? And then they get in the water and they know there's no sharp intake of breath. There's no like, like people do when they take a cold shower a lot of the time. If you can get your body that point, I think that it probably has a pretty, it's a good indicator that you're building that nervous system resilience, right?

Speaker 1:          01:13:06       Like if you can just get in cold and not freak out. Right. So that's what I think people who do cold should train themselves to be able to do. I've heard that argument about the sauna as well. It also builds like a mental toughness to be able to just sit in there and calm yourself and get used to the adverse, get to the point where you want to bang down the door and climb out. And yeah, that's what I like to get myself to in the song because obviously you get a bigger expression of heat shock protein and more blood flow when you get really hot. But yeah, there's a mental effect too. Same thing with the water is talking about that book, but the book deep and how I got into like free diving and spear fishing. God, Dph, I think you would love to do it.

Speaker 1:          01:13:43       I told you I'm going to go hunt down. He was telling me that it's like hunting underwater. Yeah. Um, uh, actually, yeah, Aubrey and I, Auburn and I spear fished in a, and Kona, uh, last year, uh, he and Whitney and I went down there and we were just using like the little three pronged guns. It wasn't full on like 80 feet deep. You know, big ass guns after Mina, after tuna. Jesus Christ. People go out there like dee, I've, I've never done deal, I'm not good enough. Like I'm under water. I attached to a tune a high, well what you do is you have a real and real is attached to a float, right? And so after you shoe and you spiro big fish like a tuna, it's not dragging you. It's dragging the float. So all you have to do is wait for that float to pop back up wherever it's going to pop up.

Speaker 1:          01:14:27       And that's how, but I haven't done that. But that's like on my bucket list. Big Time. I'm going back to Kona, I'm going back to Kona in April and that's going to be more shallow water, spear fishing. And we're going to hunt for a scrub cattle. Sheep go, you know the pig there was amazing. They have a scrub cat. Yeah. And the pig feet on like macadamia nuts and avocado and explaining the old scrub catalyst and scrub calendar this. But apparently it tastes amazing. What's Grub Bulls are, they're essentially domestic cattle that have gone feral. So some time in the past, whether it's 10, 20 generations back, whatever it was, they busted through some fences and now they're wild. And uh, in Australia they hunt and they are very dangerous. Apparently they are the most aggressive bowls bringing on, I can't wait gotta be real careful. Adam Green trees buddies got gored real bad and you had to be medivaced out of there.

Speaker 1:          01:15:16       He was in the the northern country. I'm just going to play a Shitload of techno hunt. So, so, so the book, I read this book by James Nest Door and in, I had him on my podcast and I'm like dude, I want to learn how to do this. I want, I want to learn how to like compress the spleen and go under and learn how to hold my breath and get all these nervous system benefits, spleen. The spleen just gets compelling. I'll learn how to get deep enough cause I couldn't even as an Ironman triathlete, I couldn't go deeper than 15 feet without freaking out. Cause like my, my ears, we'd get the pressure in them and I could do the, what do you call it, the, um, when you equalize, not the Frenzel technique but the, it's the, uh, you know, when you, when you go, yeah, I'm forgetting the name of pop your ears, pop your ears technique that most people do when they get into the water. But there's another technique called the Frenzel technique where you'll, you'll pull the, it's like, and you, so you're doing it just to see like your dose by dose goes out like that.

Speaker 1:          01:16:14       You do that, you can equalize it like 20 feet, 30 feet, 40 feet. So I said, who can I go learn from? He, he's like, you gotta go see this cat down in Fort Lauderdale named Ted Hardcore. It's Florida and got to go back to Florida. Everything absolutely explains Dick shocks to the stem cells. Got to learn how to do the splitting thing. So I go to, fortunately, my grandmother lives in Florida, so I, I have a place to stay when I go there. So there's that at least. Uh, and I take this free diving course and he gets me from holding my breath for about a minute and 45 seconds. He got me up to four 45, four magnum breath for five seconds. It took me from 15 fee over five days down to 80 feet where you're like trout, you, you actually, they put a rope in the water and you go vertical and you have like your bit, you know the big thins, like you have the big fins and you have Hamas that, I've seen those on people, but they're, they're like path as long as that flag, what's that like?

Speaker 1:          01:17:08       Like three, four feet. But that, yeah, they're like these big carbon fans. And I said, dude, just tell me all of the best things to buy. And I contacted the editor of carbon, so they're stiff and their car when they're stiff and you just swim soul fast in them. And I contacted the editor of spearing magazine and asking me what's the best gun to buy, what are the best fans? But, so I, I got outfitted with all this stuff and then I went down there, learn how to hold my breath, learn how to equalize. And now when I spear fish and I still, again, I haven't got to the point where I've gone, like I go after the group or, and the parrot fish and like the, the little ones, I haven't gotten to the point now where I'm hunting. The big fish is very similar to, I know the very first time I went after my, I got two at once to groupers at once and apparently it wasn't group per season, so they had me put him, put him back.

Speaker 1:          01:17:53       It's not as big of a deal is like if you shoot an elk and you know, I'm a tag, I mean like, but, but yet they have a group person. I mean not put them back. I didn't like take them down to their little group or nest and them away. But they're dead. So you can, yeah, you just leap. Yeah. You just lead them. That seems ridiculous. Well, I mean it just didn't want to get fine. They didn't want to get in trouble. All right, so, so anyways, the spearfishing, amazing. And this whole like free diving, you know, we, we got on this topic from the float tanks, similar experience. Like you're just at peace under the water. You're not wearing all the scuba equipment. So fish swim up to you and you can kind of like lay on the bottom of the water and you know, shoot something as it comes.

Speaker 1:          01:18:30       I go with my kids and they like sit on the shore with like buckets and and dives and you know, they'll help, help bring the fish and then we'd take it back. And you have like fish cook offs and it's amazing. He's very similar to but very similar field of bow hunting except it's like that peaceful setting in the water. It's probably intensely physical while it's a great workout cause you're not on there, you're cold. So you're getting all the benefits of cold thermogenesis, you know, like the white adipose to Brown fat conversion and the, and the shivering and the, and the calorie burning. And you know that angiogenesis and all the stuff you get from cold. But then you're also, you're freaking hunting, right? We're not sitting on the edge like with a, with a fishing pole over a boat, which I find intensely boring.

Speaker 1:          01:19:09       You're actually in there and you're doing all while you're holding with the fish, doing it all while you're holding your breath. Now Scuba equipment and people will do like, like I do breath hold walks. All right, well go on a walk and every time I pass a telephone pole, I'll just like take a breath and I'll hold my breath as long as possible in a pasta. Tell it when I passed the telephone pole and they'll breathe through my nose to recover. And then when I get to the next telephone pole, I'll hold my breath. Probably gonna die some day like next to a bus stop. Like a car blue in the face. But yeah, spear fit. Like you'd like it. I'm sure. I would think you'd dig it. Yeah. It seems like an interesting mental exercise table because you have to keep your shit together while you're at the water and you're wanting to take a breath.

Speaker 1:          01:19:45       You do. And people die. People do shallow water blackout and this is what I learned. That's why I, this guy sent me down to Fort Lauderdale because this guy, he teaches safety, right? You don't do like the Wim Hoff breathing and blow off all the carbon dioxide so you can hold your breath longer, which is great for holding your breath longer. But carbon dioxide is your body's signal to take a breath. If you're real, all of your carbon dioxide, then here, so you have to have walk out. So for example, you're floating on the water before you're going to take a dive down. She kind of like watching the water, you're watching the fish and you might do like a two count breath in to count hold and then 10 count breath out to count hold. And you're just like getting the heart rate down. You're getting the nervous system calm.

Speaker 1:          01:20:29       You're not even supposed to do like a lot of caffeine which jacks up the [inaudible] system and cause you to not be able to hold your breath as long dairy makes the mucus more thick and so you, you can't hold your breath as long as you do a of dairy. So you don't do a lot of dairy, you don't do a lot of caffeine and then you just dive down. And I did, uh, I brought ketones down because a lot of like a dominique d'agostino has, has, you know, he's done research on like a divers and reducing a lot of the effects of like reduced a reduced flow of oxygen to the brain that apparently these, these navy seal divers get and he does research on, on the use of Ketosis and ketones. And one of the days that we were out there, I actually took a key tones and the increased my breath hold time just using like these, these exogenous ketones.

Speaker 1:          01:21:09       So apparently they have an effect as well. I don't know if it's because the brain is using more, more of the ketones and the glucose, but they increase breath hold time that, yeah, they, they came up with that for rebreathers. Right. Like that's when they started getting people maybe seal divers when they're using rebreathers apparently in a certain percentage of them are susceptible to seizures. Yeah. And they use a, well two things, you know, ketosis and, and cbd are two things that are used for the, for like epilepsy and seizures. Yeah. Yeah. Ketosis supposedly has an amazing effect with kids, kids and did a seizures. I did 12 months of like strict Ketosis, a four study for a lab study in Florida. No, I'm just kidding. That's a university of Connecticut. This guy named um, uh, Jeff Volak. He does a lot of like ketone research and he had one group of athletes follow just a normal and Darren's athlete Diet for 12 months and another group follow like a high fat low carb Ketogenic Diet for 12 months because he wanted to see if you would maintain your glycogen levels and if you would, uh, if your performance would be synonymous to the group that did not eat the high fat, low carb Diet, what would happen to inflammatory markers?

Speaker 1:          01:22:22       What would happen to the gut microbiome? So, but he wanted like a lot of these studies on high fat, low carb diets. They'll follow people for like two weeks or three days and have meat like high fat, low carb and then see what happens when they go jam on a bike for 30 minutes or exercise. But they want to do like a longterm study to see if the body can adapt to burning fats as a fuel with long term utilization of a high fat diet, which I don't do any more by the way. I, I like, I save all my carbohydrates for the evening. Then I eat a bunch of carbohydrates in the evening. What kind of carbs you eat? Oh, like a red wine. Dark chocolate too. Or starches, yams, sweet potatoes. You my, my wife's a cook, so she does like this amazing like slow fermented sourdough bread, which pre digest all the gluten and the doors.

Speaker 1:          01:23:05       The glycaemic index, like pretty much keen wa Amaranth, millet. I don't follow a specific diet in terms of like restricting certain food groups. My philosophy is you just make them digestible, eating carbs at night that it's good thing to relax you as well. Technically you're more insulin sensitive in the morning, but you can make yourself more insulin sensitive in the evening and the advantage of that is if you consume a bunch of your carbohydrates in the morning when you're in an insulin sensitive state, what are you going to rely upon as your primary fuel during the rest of the day? Karma hydrates, right? Instead of teaching your body how to be a fat burning machine and tap into fats and generate ketones. So you save your carbohydrate intake for the end of the day. But I also saved my hard workout for the end of the day, which is when your body temperature peaks and your grip strength peaks and uh, you, you, you, you can do a hard workout.

Speaker 1:          01:23:59       And anybody who's rolls out of bed and tried to do a crossfit wad versus doing it, you know, the 5:00 PM the afternoon knows this. Like you can do it pretty good hard workout like in the later afternoon or the evening when you're warmed up. But that also upregulates insulin sensitivity and the activity of these glute four transporters that can shove glucose in the muscle tissue for example. And so then you can have your cake and eat it too, right? You, you create your own insulin sensitive state and then you go off and, and typically I'll finish that workout around like six, six 30 right? And like I mentioned, I don't eat dinner for a couple hours after the workout is like a eight 30 we sit down to a family dinner and I'll just use as many carbohydrates as I want because I'm in an insulin sensitive state by the next morning and I tested this for a while.

Speaker 1:          01:24:40       I did like the blood ketone and the breath ketone testing. I'm back in a fat burning state by the next morning, but also with the bread, I've also replenish my glycogen stores and my liver and my muscle to be able to do the next days. Hard workout. Right? So I like this strategy for athletes because they can get all the benefits of a fat burning state. The reduced free radical production from excess glucose intake, the reduced young glycaemic variability, which is honestly a, it's a, it's a pretty big marker for in my opinion, like like your risk factor for a host of chronic diseases like spiking your blood glucose multiple times during the day. So instead you just don't eat carbohydrates all day, do a hard workout at the end of the day and then have your carbohydrates to replenish all your energy levels. Then you go into the next day. And then what's your primary food source during the day?

Speaker 1:          01:25:25       Like what do you do? You have like standards so you, we, we have a lot of like really good wild plants that grow up in the, on our land. So I have 10 acres up there in Washington state and we've got like wild, not all and meant and plantation and Oregon grape root and comfrey and all these amazing plants. So we also have eight raised garden beds where we grow Kale and Bok Choy, Swiss chard. And so raise them so that they don't learn. They're not as obsessed stubble to ground frost or like when you raise a garden bed, you can just add whatever type of soil that you want versus digging down, cause my wife does a lot of composting because we have chickens and goats. So she used a lot of the, a lot of the dung from the chickens and the goats. And the leftover food from inside and does composting.

Speaker 1:          01:26:05       And so we use a lot of this and the raised garden beds. Nice. I started gardening this year. Indoors, I'm growing something called spilanthes, which I can tell you about later. It's amazing. I found an inquiry. But the um, the what I do during the day and eat a lot of wild plants, right? So, so I'll come in when I'm coming in from like that cold pool in the morning. I like gathering some plants and I throw those in a blender with like some, some fats like coconut milk or coconut oil, uh, all the, like some bone broth and some lemon because when you mix the vitamin C with college and you make the college and a lot more absorbable. So I'll mix the vitamin C with bone broth. I'll put that into the blender. A whole bunch of superfoods. Don't blend it for like two minutes. Cause if you blend it for a long time, it gets like a texture, like a Wendy's frosty.

Speaker 1:          01:26:48       So it's like, and you can like eat it with, with, you know, one of those long you've had a wendy's frosty for, right? Yeah. You look confused when I said Wendy's fries. Strange. What kind of horrible life you led. What did your parents do to you? You never had a wendy's frosty, so, so it gets like this Wendy's frosty like consistency. It's just a bunch of wild plants and fats. And I put like that Stevia in there. I put a little bit of mccowen there. Uh, sometimes we'll do like a little bit of whey protein, like a good like grass fed whey or some kind of protein source. And then I put like a crunchy things and so I put it all in a bowl with a spatula crunchy. Yeah. Like coconut flakes and could count hibbs and uh, like I use like these little spiralina and chlorella tablets.

Speaker 1:          01:27:29       And so it's like eating a, it's like when you go to a yogurt store and you get the yogurt and you get the toppings on top of it, but it's like this amazing Kenogenic superfood rich meal. And by blending it all together and blending the fats with all the, all the ingredients, you're actually enhancing the absorption. And so, so that's what I have for breakfast. You should open a cafe. So that sounds good. Well I'm trying to like, I'm trying to make it into like a, uh, like a drinkable, a drinkable form. Something that is the same thing that um, yeah, I'm going over to see, uh, uh, Rick Ruben after this over in Malibu and he does the same thing for breakfast. And that's actually one of the things we're talking about how we can make this no so random. Like we, we go sauna together over there in Malibu and we were, uh, we both do the same thing.

Speaker 1:          01:28:17       Like his, his, his, his is a little bit different. Like he put some different things in it at the same thing and it's an amazing breakfast cause you can sit there and like I do a lot of dictation on my computer, so I'll sit there and I'll dictate emails. But while I'm eating my, my smoothie with a spoon, it's amazing. And then I do a salad for breakfast or for lunch, a big ass salad. Again, whole bunch of wild plants and I'll put like sardines, seeds, nuts, you know, just, just good, good fats on them. And, uh, then I have like these Nori wraps, right, which is like a seaweed wrap. You're really good in iodine. Really nutrient dense. And I'm gonna use miracle noodles. Have you had miracle noodles? No. So they're made out of Japanese Yam, they called them. Sure. Talky noodles. It's in my kids make pad Thai out of this and they have like a cooking podcast where they do all these crazy crazy meals.

Speaker 1:          01:29:02       And one of the things they use a lot of are these shirataki noodles. So I make these Japanese Yam and it was, I put him on top of the salad and then I roll that up and like a noi, Burrito wrap. And I eat that like a Burrito for lunch. And then dinner, like I mentioned, it's just, you know, whatever my wife happens because dinner is Mike, my free mail. Right. It's just whatever I want to have. But for this study for Jeff Volek Slab is 12 months strict ketosis and they brought us into the lab. Uh, they had me in the, in the group of Kenogenic athletes and also the whole group of, of endurance athletes following a traditional carbohydrate rich diet, uh, do a vo two Max test the night that we got there. And then the next morning they punched a bunch of holes and our thighs with needles and did a biopsy of the muscle to see how much glycogen was in the muscle.

Speaker 1:          01:29:44       And then with these big holes in our, in our muscles, we had to go run on a treadmill for three hours. So I ran 22 miles on the, on the whole like look up, like wanting to see how much do they want to see, how much glycogen they pull. It's like a muscle biopsy. It's like a little bleak Ghia team. That's a big deal, especially when you go pound on the treadmill after you've had these, these needle biopsies and your thighs. And then they did fat biopsy because they wanted to look at fat content up on either side of the hips. And then I ran for three hours on this treadmill and it was horrible. There was like no TV. There's no, no, there's a white wall on the treadmill. But they, and, and I was hooked up to like a a, you know, like, like a, a blood collection device because it was, what am I in the night I had a Walkman and a, I had my, I had my mouth, my aerobics socks on like Jane Fonda back in the day.

Speaker 1:          01:30:34       Exactly. Yeah. And my running, so you just running single hour staring at the walls around for three hours. Stats gotta be the worst part of it is horrible. Yeah. I didn't know going in, I walked in the room and I'm like, Oh shit. Cause I would have brought, you know like yeah, just something to watch. But I ran and they were testing fat oxidation rates at rest and an exercise. So I'm wearing this, this mask, it's, it does what's called indirect calorimetry where based on the carbon dioxide that you breathe out, the oxygen that you consume, it approximates your carbohydrate and your fat burning. Right. It's Kinda like the gold standard of, of metabolic testing in laboratory testing situations like in an exercise physiology lab. And so you're, you're testing how much fat you're burning during exercise, how much carbohydrate you're burning during exercise, something called your, your respiratory exchange ratio.

Speaker 1:          01:31:17       Is that what it's called? And the prevailing uh, research and the literature suggests that you can burn about 1.0 grams of fat per minute during exercise. Like that would be about how much fat you would burn 1.0 grams of fat per minute. When they tested, this was called the faster study f. A. S. T. E. R. They found that the folks who fall at a high fat diet like me and these other people who were eating high fat diet, we were burning 1.5 to 1.7 grams of fat per minute during exercise. During this three hour treadmill run. We had no deficit in performance. Our Vo Two max is we're just as high and we maintained our levels of muscle glycogen. And so basically there was no, we didn't go any faster, but I'm not saying like, like a Kenogenic diet is going to keep better at endurance sports cause I've never seen any evidence that that's going to happen.

Speaker 1:          01:32:03       But we did go just as fast and we actually burnt, we turned our bodies into fat burning machines over the course of 12 months. It was actually a really cool study. So the benefits would not be necessarily performance, but the benefits are more health tips. It's like, you know, a lot of people like they get gut rot and fermentation from eating a lot of fermentable carbohydrates. Some people get small intestinal bacterial overgrowth. Um, some people get blood glucose fluctuations. Uh, you see, uh, you see a drop in what's called the first phase insulin response. Like normally you're supposed to produce a lot of insulin when you eat a meal or at least enough to be able to shove that sub straight into storage tissue. And normally you'd be able to produce this. And by getting a lot of glycaemic variability during the day, you eventually produce insulin insensitivity, right?

Speaker 1:          01:32:48       Like you don't have that normal first phase insulin response and you can, you can restore it. You know, you can use things like bitters and chew your food a lot and you know, strength trained before you eat a carbohydrate rich meal and you know, things like that. But ultimately, uh, yeah, it's more of like a health and longevity thing. It's not like a like eating low carbohydrate makes you faster. It's just that you avoid a lot of the potential issues, the potential health issues that would come with a large amount of glucose fluctuations. But there's exceptions to that rule. Or like you could go get your genetics tested and you might find out, you have, let's say familial hypercholesterolemia, right? In which case if you eat like a key topic diet, you'll produce a lot of like oxidized and you'll see people with cholesterol like 400, 500 and really high lp, little a and all these issues with a high amount of fat consumption because their bodies are unable to deal with that amount of cholesterol.

Speaker 1:          01:33:41       Um, that's a big point. That's a big point. The customers can't stress that enough. Is it human beings? Very so. And the huge, yeah, huge amount. Like a, there's a great book that Brian Count turned me onto that I'm reading right now called Sapiens, the origins of human beings. It's completely fascinating. It's crazy. There's another book called biochemical individuality. It's like an old book, but I was looking through, it's fascinating like, like there's like 12 different shapes of the stomach and like seven different ways that the hardest shaped and certain people will excrete copious amounts of vitamin D and need a lot more vitamin D intake and other people develop vitamin D toxicity in response like the 2000 and 4,000 international units that a lot of people are popping in these days. Certain people develop high cholesterol and high triglycerides and high inflammation in response to to a ketogenic diet and some people don't.

Speaker 1:          01:34:28       And so like we live in an era where it's like it's cheap to get your genes tested and it's only going to get cheaper. Well, it's also theirs. You'd have to really find a good expert that really understands what the difference in the genetic variability is. Our, yeah, I mean like otherwise you're just testing, like you're trying to ketogenetic diet, testing out your blood work and trying to figure it out. It's very complicated to the, for the lay person it is. But I mean like in very simplistic terms, I've told some people that that's right. You could at least test your genetics and there's actually a really good book about this called uh, um, the jungle effect by Doctor Daphne Miller. And she goes into how like she'll put like her, her Hispanic clients on like a traditional Mexican diet comprised of like, you know, uh, soaked and sprouted legumes and low glycemic index, you know, tortillas and non gmo corn and take them back to what their ancestors would have eaten.

Speaker 1:          01:35:21       Like she'll literally take like what the Tar Mahara Indian drive is eating and South America and put her Hispanic clients on that. Or she'll put like her African American clients on a fiber rich fermented like Cambodian diet and, and you could easily do it like it's not rocket science, right? You go, your genetics tested, you see where your ancestors came from and you try to approximate, and obviously we're a genetic melting pot in America and there's gonna be some people who are just like, oh crap I came from, I come from Japan and Europe and Ethiopia. You know, like there's some people who come from all over the place, in which case you would have to take a deeper dive, right? You can get blood work, you can get, what I tell people is get your genes tested like a comprehensive blood analysis. Get your gut tested, right?

Speaker 1:          01:36:04       So you could look at your bacterial balance, presence of parasites, yeast, fungus, all those kinds of little things that that affect gut health and personality and everything else at the microbiome affects. Uh, and then like a, like a urine test for hormones, which is more accurate than a blood test. That's a lot of testing. But if you really, really truly want to dial things in its genetic testing, it's blood testing, urinary testing for hormones. There's a test called a, the, the Dutch test. It tests like your testosterone all throughout the day. The metabolites of testosterone and your cortisol all throughout the day, the metabolites of Cortisol. So you could actually see like, you know, do I really have high cortisol or am I just not breaking it down quickly enough? For example, I just wish there was a place that you could go that was very comprehensive that the average person go to where they could do all this stuff for you and break it down for you.

Speaker 1:          01:36:52       That seems like there's more and more of a market of that test. Every thousand dollars. It's the Hue. Actually. There is a place like it's like the human, there's, you know, some of these guys who were like trying to live forever. Like, uh, I think one of them is, is Peter Diamandis. Uh, Craig venter I think is another guy. He's like the human human longevity institute, I think it's called. Yeah, like some of these, some of these rich dudes, right? Like a lot of these billionaires, they're going to this place as and in getting like the comprehensive blood testing done. I, I do a lot of that myself just by ordering it, you know, from like direct labs are these little, you have a deep understanding and knowledge about all this stuff. It's different than the average price on injecting stem cells into the mind. But I think for the average person that's listening to this, it's uh, it's a little confusing and maybe a little frustrating because it would be nice if there was a place that you'd go with the, like the dentist, you go to the dentist, Hey bob, you've got a cavity.

Speaker 1:          01:37:42       It's all pretty straight. Exactly that will, there's companies working on that right now. Like, like an actual dashboard where you get a home test kit done and they're like, they're actually like microneedles now that you can attach to the scan that you patch it on yourself, you send off a tiny, tiny amount of blood and you'd get a host of blood values back and then you would be able to see like what you have deficits in. And I could totally see them pairing that with like food delivery companies are like, you know, even just like printouts. So like, here's your protein, carb fat ratio. Right? It'll happen. Now, when you were on the strict Ketogenic Diet for 12 months, what was your diet like? What did you basically eat? No Italian.

Speaker 1:          01:38:22       Great. When you got off, I remember what I was like my bodybuilding days where like you go way in like in the morning before the show and then the rest of the day you eat like freaking ice cream and bread and you look like just like an Olympic God when you get up on stage cause everything's popping right. Like all that glycogen gets restored after about eight hours. Uh, the, how does that work on my first meal? Well, when you don't eat many carbohydrates, you upregulate levels was something called glycogen synthase, which is an enzyme responsible for helping to get glycogen in the muscle tissue. This would be a process that you would do before, like Aj and depletion followed by glycogen restoration causes this big surge in glycogen plus going into a show, you're restricting carbohydrates anyways because it's hard to get very, very low body fat. That's why you see bodybuilders eating fricking like chicken and Broccoli, right?

Speaker 1:          01:39:15       So, um, the, the same thing. It's something I did when I did triathlon. Right. You'll like carbohydrate deplete the weekend before a race. And then I used to do this. You'd eat no carbohydrates on Saturday and Sunday for a race that follows the next Sunday. And then Monday you'd start to eat more carbohydrates Tuesday even more. And by like Saturday before the Ray Street and like 90% carbohydrate. This is what I did before I kind of trained my body to like, you know, ketosis and function while on a low carb diet. But it, you're just, I mean you're jacked up chock full of glycogen cause you upregulate that enzyme. It's called a, what's it called? Carbohydrate. Let's just basically carbohydrate depletion, carbohydrate loading. So was there any benefit of that performance wise versus what you're doing now? Um, there's, there's not necessarily a benefit in that you, uh, you go faster if you've trained your body how to operate well on a low carbohydrate diet.

Speaker 1:          01:40:16       I've never, like I said, seen any evidence that like a low carbohydrate ketogenetic diet makes you go faster than if you were eating like a regular like carbohydrate rich diet. But I also haven't seen that. If you do like I did and follow it strict for a long time. There's not a lot of evidence that makes you go slower either. So it's kind of like, it's like even as a kid, right? So it's just a health longevity Ben. It's more of like, hey, if I can live a longer time and feel better and produce less reactive oxygen species by doing this versus the high carbohydrate intake, then why not do it? And I mean when you look at like the Nike project and how they were to break the marathon record in Italy, they were using like these crazy engineered forms of carbohydrate where they went way above like these Maltodextrin, fructose blends that a lot of companies like, you know, like gatorade use and they were using these super engineered carbs.

Speaker 1:          01:41:07       It's possible that some of these newer carbohydrates that are engineered for extremely high absorption could, could beat out. Like if we were to study those in like a, you know, a high fat, low carb athlete who had followed that diet for a long period of time versus like a traditionally fueled athlete who was eating these new fangled engineered carbohydrates. It's possible the new fangled engineered carbohydrates could make you go faster button unless your paycheck is on the line and you're a pro. I still say, why not get that balance between health and longevity and speed. My thyroid though did not like that high fat ketogenic diet director paired with high levels of physical activity. My testosterone went down were like there were some issues. That's fascinating because usually you hear the opposite. People with thyroid disease, they recommend a ketogenic diet to those people. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:41:52       But look at it this way and I explained this to to a lot of athletes who I work with who wanted to do the ketogenic diet thing. You read, uh, you know, you read a book like a, you know, there's some fantastic ketogenic diets out there that are plant rich, which a lot of ketogenetic diets aren't right? Like there'll be like coconut oil and butter and that actually creates a lot of gastric inflammation. In the absence of, of like, you know, high amount of polyphenols and flavonoids and high fiber and planning type like you want both. I wrote an article about this called the dark side of coconut oil that gets into the fact that if you're going to do like a high fat, low carb Ketogenic type of diet, you would want to include a lot of plants and like uh, a Dr. Terry Walls is a book called the walls protocol that's got a plant rich kenogenic version it.

Speaker 1:          01:42:32       Um, Steven gundry has his book, the plant paradox and he has like a, he has like a ketogenic version in that book that's like very plant rich. So if, if you're eating like a, like a plant rich keto genic diet and you're following what a lot of these people I've written, you generally be advised he like 30 to 50 grams of carbohydrates per day, which is fine if you have thyroid disease or you have some other issue, you know, pre diabetes, whatever, and you're trying to control it with a ketogenic diet. But then once you throw copious amounts of physical activity into the mix, right? Your crossfit or you're an Ironman triathlete and you go read the one of these books and you read the supposed to be 50 grams of carbohydrates, well you know, the authors of those books, to my knowledge are not out racing ironman triathlons and doing marathons and copious amounts of physical activity.

Speaker 1:          01:43:15       So you have to up the carbohydrate intake. So it's all about, you know, so for me personally, like a hundred to 200 grams of carbohydrate, it's still bad tanky carbohydrate feed. At the end of the day I'll still maintain ketosis. And so you again, you have your cake and eat it too. That's a radical physical output though. You're taking. Exactly. So if you have like a thyroid issue and you're highly active and you want to follow Ketogenic Diet, then you need to include more carbohydrates than it would be recommended in let's say like a more sedentary type of ketone giant die because you're always reading these diets based on just the average person and the average person is just not going to put out that kind of APP. You want to include a lot of the things that that you tend to build up deficits in like potassium and magnesium or two biggies and you dump a lot of glycogen and glycogen stores, a bunch of water and it stores a bunch of electrolytes.

Speaker 1:          01:44:02       You have to figure out how to replace that and now people are using, you know these, these exogenous ketones, the ketone salts or Ketone esters and the danger with those is now you can like get into ketosis but still also have high blood glucose and that's something that we haven't really studied. Like that's not like our ancestors out hunting right for that. Like it's not like were in ketosis because they were burning a lot of their own body fat. And generating keytones as a byproduct. And they were, they were in just like a natural state cause they weren't eating a lot of food. Sometimes just, you know, not stuffing their face with carbohydrates and glucose. But now people are able to eat a normal western diet and like buy one of these ketone supplements and also be in Ketosis. So you're hyperglycemic and hyperkeratotic. And I've like, I did that before race and I felt like I was on steroids.

Speaker 1:          01:44:54       Like it was like rocket fuel because my blood glucose was jacked through the roof. But so I did a bunch of like fructose Maltodextrin, energy based gels, and then I drank a bottle of these ketone esters, which basically, I mean the, they have, if you measure your ketones, you'll, you'll know that this is high. But within 10 minutes, my values were above seven millimolar, which is just off the charts for ketones. But my blood glucose was also off the charts. And I felt like my cells had like both forms of fuel they'd ever need, both ketones and glucose. And I felt amazing. But all bet, I mean that's similar like diabetic ketoacidosis. Like, if you're in that state all the time and you're using all these ketone supplements and just eating your diet and using these cause your quote in Ketosis Unquote, I don't think it's healthy.

Speaker 1:          01:45:37       I wonder if it would be great though performance wise, like for a fight. It's amazing. It's amazing. You feel unstoppable. I would think that, I wonder if athletes I've tried and as long as you use that is, it's like a, it's like you use it as a, you know, it's like heard somebody say when it's like sugars are sometimes drug, right? Cause it does like you can feel it and can give you, especially if you're, if you're not fat adapted, I mean carbohydrates give you a pretty big boost in performance and energy versus not having them on board and you're exercising and especial or exercising hard and this would be like that, right? Like if you were to use that as a sometimes drug and be careful with it. Um, I could see that being a huge, like it was kind of a bump where you going to like, um, I didn't quantify it.

Speaker 1:          01:46:16       If you try to use it was, it was, it was a tough mudder in Vegas and all I know is I felt way, way more.like, like I had the cognitive high that you get from ketones, which was the original reason that I started doing, like I started doing this ketosis thing like seven years ago when I was getting ready to race iron man Canada. And I wanted to see what it would feel like to have those readily available fuel sources for the liver and the diaphragm and the heart and kind of the focus that comes with high levels of ketones when you're on a bike for five hours. And I had that when I took these exogenous ketones, but then I also had all the energy that you get when you just, you know, like after you've had like a, like a candy bar, right?

Speaker 1:          01:46:54       So it's, yeah, your high blood sugar and high blood ketones. So you'd, so you'd just feel focused, but you also have high levels of energy. That sounds amazing. That's amazing. I just like the stem cells in the tech cry. It's amazing. I hope it's good. I hope I don't die. Yeah. That sounds like though if you were doing a big event and if you didn't do it up to the like, I like what you're doing is in terms of diet wise it seems like it makes sense. I've got a really good balance, but for a big event that sounds like it'd be a really good thing to do. Look it up on carbohydrates, load up on the ketone esters. Right, exactly. Tonessa ketone esters are expensive. Yeah, and a lot of these ketone salts you don't like about the ketone salts too is, I haven't seen a lot of resources at the ketone esters are necessarily that much better.

Speaker 1:          01:47:36       And the ketone salts, you get electrolytes with them too. Right, and that's one of the things that you get depleted on. I'm like, what ketogenetic do you know what, what brand you're using for your ketone supplements? Dude, I told you I'm like, as a blogger I get these packages sent to my house every day. Just like you probably get the same thing. It's like cardboard boxes full of boxes and occasional little paper bag. It was something that somebody made in their kitchen that they sent, somebody gave me. Uh, so when we gave me, when I was, this was, where was, I think it was an Asheville doing a race and Asheville, North Carolina at Asheville fricking great fat is oh, crazy little spot. I, one of my clients took me to this place called karate. It's like a shark coolray like a fine shark, a restaurant.

Speaker 1:          01:48:16       Amazing me. Amazing. Apparently like a president, President Obama's like favorite restaurant wasn't Asheville and he'd go there and you go up and down the street and just, I went there during the yoga festival and there's like people sitting up in trees playing banjos and like, it's crazy. It's amazing. I definitely want to go back there. Yeah, the International Yoga Festival in Asheville, but the um, shout out to Ashville, Ashville, baby Hashtag Asheville somebody gave me like wine that they infused with cannabis, like at like this big bottle, like cannabis infused wine. But it was like one of those old school like Kombucha bottles, like the glass and you're just like, I don't know where this has been. [inaudible] I don't know what's in here. Nope. Um, it was a cool idea, but, uh, no offense to whoever gave me that, but I didn't actually consume that. But the, uh, the ketone salts and the ketone esters, um, honestly, dude, I've tried like all of them, uh, you know, key genics and uh, Kito I forget what the enteral Kido something Keith keep genics and went to school in Nashville and uh, he said that they started giving the cows a certain diet to kill the silicide mushrooms that grow in their shit because too many kids were climbing fences and early and plucking mushrooms out of the cow.

Speaker 1:          01:49:30       Shit. You ever do that? You ever do like the silicide been microdosing thing that people are doing for cognition? I have silicide microdosed I've taken and it gives you a nice feeling. I like it gives you, I have a friend who's a world champion kickboxer who micro doses every day and he says it him almost telepathic, you says it makes his, his response time to sparring. He said he sees things before they happen or sensory perception, especially in nature settings, right? Like, there's this, there's like this synthetic chemical, ella chemical, LSD or pls. LSD is like the one a lot of people are using now cause you get it for a lot less expensive and it, it has the same effect as, as LSD. It's just, it's, it's a lot cheaper and you get both and you don't like these websites where you use cryptocurrency to, to purchase the compound.

Speaker 1:          01:50:15       But the FBI sent it to you. Exactly. They dunt dunt dunt Duh. You, uh, it's very synthetic and there's like a merging of the left and right hemispheres of the brain and you get very creative and focus simultaneously doses you, uh, for Lsd, you, you want to volume metrically dose, which means like if you get a blotter of Lsd, it's like a hundred micrograms. I'm like a square. And a lot of people will cut that into like 10 pieces. So that one piece would be 10 micrograms. But you don't know if that piece has like 20 or five on it. Right? So you take a hundred a hundred microgram tab and you put that in like a little like a, like a glass dropper bottle and then you would add like 10 milliliters of everclear or vodka or some kind of alcohol to it. And then you know that for every one milliliter of alcohol in that little dropper bottle that you consume, you're getting exactly 10 micrograms of LSD and about 10 to 20 micrograms, like one to two dropper bottles full.

Speaker 1:          01:51:18       That would be considered a microdose for most people. But you don't like returning to psilocybin. Silicide produces like this sensory perception, very natural feeling, uh, improvement in your, in your cognition and your senses that, that it just feels more natural rights. Like you, you would take it before you go on on a hike or you would take it when you're in like a very, very natural, like a nature setting. Like for something like a day at the office. Like it seems like Lsd is like a more natural choice. But suicide is really interesting for like, you know, nature based setting, hiking. Well, the thing about it is you feel like you, you're getting readings from trees and plants. Yeah. Get a weird feeling from the, you don't normally get like, oh now I'm tuned into whatever frequency you guys are operating and they, they feel alive.

Speaker 1:          01:52:08       Whereas trees just feel like trees. Normally I walk by like they look beautiful and, but I don't feel them write the same sentence. Right, exactly. And, and I mean, you don't want to, you don't want to make yourself dependent on finding a tree beautiful by whether or not you have silicide even a beautiful turn blood stream. Like it's communicating with you. You know what I'm saying? It's like exactly like they're giving you information, you save it for those settings when you want nature to be really special. Because my wife gives me a hard time sometimes she was like, you know, why do you gotta take psilocybin for, I got to go on a hike. Like, why don't you just go on a hike? And I told her, you know, sometimes it's more interesting. Sometimes you see things you wouldn't normally otherwise see. So, you know, I go to bed and I've got like my binaural beats and my sleep mask and you know, I've got like that little grounding earthing device under my body and my chilly pad and uh, you know, blue light blocking glasses and, and you know, I get in bed with all these wires sticking up out of my head and my wife just gets in bed and just like sleeps cause just got nothing on her side.

Speaker 1:          01:53:03       So we're very yin and Yang. But you're still involved like everything you're doing, you're very involved. Does it ever feel overwhelming that you have all this stuff? I mean obviously it's what you do cause you, you systematize it, right? Like when I walk into my office, it's not like I'm spending 20 minutes like turning on the turning on the Jews of light and putting on the essential oil diffuser and um, uh, you know, I've got like a, this, this device that creates like special water that you breathe. Well, you know, humidifies the water that you breathe while you're working. And I've got like, you know, blue light generating devices on the ceiling and all this stuff in my office. But when I walk in there, it's just like click, click, click, and I go to work right it with the thing on my head or whatever.

Speaker 1:          01:53:42       So it's, once you systematize it, it's not exhausting. It's not like you're doing a lot to actually improve your body or you don't say Bilac your body while you're, while you're at work during a lot of stuff just become systematized, right? It's like putting on your pants in the morning. The words about done, I'm about done with that word. Biohack were beaten up that word. Now what I would consider to be biohacking is, you know, these dudes that like in jet chlorella into their eyes so that they could get night vision. You should pull that up. Or, or like, uh, Kevin, Kevin Warrick, like he was like the original Cyborg guy who got like a chip implanted under the skin or the people who will inject like magnets in their fingertips to be able to interact with devices. So they would use the human body is what they call wet ware and then install hardware.

Speaker 1:          01:54:27       Like to me that's a true biohacker for me to blend like curcumin with olive oil and bone broth and vitamin C and my smoothie. That's not like a biohack. That's just a health, just like making a meal, right? Like it's, it's like, yeah. Yeah. So I took it too. There are trending through bio hackers out there who actually hacked their biology but injecting chlorella in your eyes. Yeah, it seems super risky actually. You know, I think its chlorophyll, which is the, which is the green active component that you would find something like Chlorella, but his eyes were all black. It's really where you should pull it up, Jamie. Like dude injected ever. I'm assuming. I mean I don't think he could suck the chlorophyll back out, but he has night vision now or the guy who is goat man. Did you hear about Goldman? No.

Speaker 1:          01:55:15       Hold on. Let's one, one step at a time. You're almost manic and it's like, I've got another one. I got another one. Hold on. So this guy has permanent black in his eyes and he can see like sorta like a deer, like nocturnal. Oh yeah, that's him. That's okay. Making science more available to the public have been testing of chemicals that allows humans to see in the dark and it works. That's a true bio. Ha. That's a correct use of the term biohacking. It's got some other people. Then you can get like, uh, what's this on? Nerdist. Yeah. nerdist.com there it goes straight into the eye. I'm not going to do that. I will stop at the stem cells into my Dick. I'm not going to know things. The speculum holding my eyes open was by far the worst part. Even the effects themselves were very subtle.

Speaker 1:          01:56:03       It wasn't like, oh my God, I have Predator vision. Nothing like that. You don't get super powers. This is a tweak, not an overhaul. It's kind of disappointing that you go through all that for just the tweak. Yeah. Well your whole fucking eyes into that shit. I want Predator vision. I want the full meal deal. I want to be able to hunt animals in the darkness. Works by binding to ops and proteins in your retina where it's excited by light transformational process to occur in the protein segment. See, there you go, Huh? Yeah. So you could get the blue light blocking glasses or you could just inject everything into your eyes. Allowed him pick to pick up figures in the dark with 100% accuracy. We're non treated test subjects. You'd only make out to about 30% pretty significant. Well that would be really good. And I liked it.

Speaker 1:          01:56:45       I liked how the author doesn't know which percentage signed to use the actual percentage sign or the word percent. Right. They got to work on their, on their editing. That's interesting. Your writer, 50 meters. To go back to that Jamie, we're talking 50 meters over 160 feet apart. Oh Wow. That's actually really significant. The following morning his eyes returned to normal. Oh, I right. Just say that right there is returned to normal and side effects. Oh Wow. So he's not like that. They're not injecting. They're dropping. They using drops. So this would be like we were talking about bow hunting about elk hunting. Like, like when you're in sort of low light, that might be the mood, could pack your speculum into your case, drop them in there, make sure that you have a hunting buddy who is well versed in the addition of chlorophyll, rubber gloves, rubber gloves.

Speaker 1:          01:57:37       You've got all that stuff to feel dress anyways and just go to town on your eyes. How did you get into bow hunting? Uh, my buddy, uh, canton, Claremont up in Washington state, he was running these trained to competitions which are really bad. I also of course racing with a weapon, it's a ton of, and you could do it out here and like, cause you have a, like you could carry sandbags, do like cones and suicides, prints and all sorts of stuff with this technical hunt set up that you have. But that trying to hunt like uh, the, the first competition that I did you, you show up and it starts off with like a four or five hour traditional three d shoot. And for people who don't know what a three d shoot is, it's a bunch of targets, you know, like Reinhardt targets or whatever that are set up.

Speaker 1:          01:58:15       Well explain that they different locations to a jetty. Look Robert Hill, they look like animals are going to be a fox or an or an elk or you know, whatever. You know, uh, uh, a bedded animal or a standing animal and they're spread throughout this course that you're walking. You can think of it almost like golfing, you know, for people who, who don't bow hunt and you'll, you know, one shot might just be like a simple 25 yard shot at a Fox where if you get vitals, you'll get the five points. And if you hit a body shot then it might be three points. And if you miss it's zero. And if you get like a wound, it's actually a negative score. Right. Which it should be like, it's like a night. Cause if you wound an animal that's, that's really much, much worse than missing an animal.

Speaker 1:          01:58:59       Right. So some of the shots are pretty complex. It might be you got to get off two shots in 10 seconds, which is actually kind of hard to do. You know, two shots in 10 seconds and one animals at 20 and one animals at 40. All right. Which is why I use like a three pin side on my ball because you don't even have time to adjust the dial after you've taken one shot to the yardage for the second shot. Um, you might have a shot that's like run up this hill. There is a target up there. We won't tell you the distance, but you have 30 seconds to make it the 25 yards up that up, that goalie. And then you're going to have a shot at the top and you got to run up the goal he site and get your shot off in those 30 seconds.

Speaker 1:          01:59:38       Right? So, so it's not like a traditional three d shoot. It's very active, you know, and some shots are, are you draw lunging and then you stand and then you got to walk around the tree and then take your shots. So it's actually pretty fun. It's way different than just like standing out of the range, shooting a target and you get a certain score coming out of that, right? Like you might have a mass x number of points or or lost x number of points and then you go into, um, and they actually, they, this year they've kind of like changed it because a lot of people were like getting hurt and blowing out their knees with this next part. But you do what's called like a meat pack, which is a hundred pounds in your pack and it's two to four mile course that you got to boogie across as fast as possible.

Speaker 1:          02:00:17       People were running. And the problem with it was people like when you pack out, like you're taking it on time, you're not running, you're not like racing your buddy but this, and it was like the most painful thing of really ever done in terms of like how high my heart rate got and the amount of lactic acid. Like just try to go two miles fast. You can with a hundred pounds in your pack. Sounds very not only you've got to spend like I would spend copious amounts of times like making sure the pack was adjusted properly and I'll put like the bubble wrap in the bottom of the pack. So it moves the weight that you're using, which are typically sandbags up to the center of the pack. And I worked with this company called [inaudible] that makes like these facts. Yeah they make a jump back Aaron.

Speaker 1:          02:00:56       Um exactly. And you know he did some skype sessions with me where he taught me exactly cause you don't set it up the way that you would if you were just going to pack out in animal, you have to put it super duper tight up in the shoulder so it's not bouncing around. And then you put the weight down in the hips. So it works for running two miles really hard. But it's super uncomfortable and it's not biomechanically favorable sucks but it's good to have it running. Yeah. So they call that the meat pack right. And have to do it that way or is it just a matter of how much weight you have on your back? Like if you could use one of those atlas packs, have you seen those atlas things from outdoors means it's essentially it's a pack frame with a traditional Olympic boats on the end of it where you put the plates on it.

Speaker 1:          02:01:36       What are those things called and then the end of a weight bar or the white wait slide on them. What would you call that? The end of a weight borrower. The weights. Like a barbell? Yeah, the end of the bar bar around the end of the bar. Well they have one of those I post, I guess you've got to post. Yeah. Yeah. They have one of those. It's hanging out in the back. See if you can find it. It's called the atlas trainer Jamie outdoorsman. [inaudible] dot com um, as a PAC. It's PAC frame with a, I hiked with it on this. Is it a picture? It's pretty dope. Whoa. Okay. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Speaker 1:          02:02:11       Cool. You could use whatever you want as long as, as long as you have waiting it. You just have to figure out how to, cause everybody has to use a standard weight so you have to use the sandbag that they issue to you. Your use the same object that so everybody's using a sand bag just so you don't come in with your own weight. I was just saying if he did that that you like that you painted a 45 pound logo on um, anyways though she didn't meet, pack in and he gives her amount of time for that. And then you do the obstacle course which is the real hoot and which they still do, which is cause I think got rid of the meat pack. But the obstacle courses me pack it. Well it's not, it doesn't make sense, right? Like they designed this whole competition to simulate hunting, to prepare a hunter to hunt and to train a hundred a hundred properly and it just flew in the face of everything that is hunting, which is jacked up nervous system, you know, rushing through the woods with a giant package.

Speaker 1:          02:03:02       You just, you don't pack out an animal like that. Then they'd have to figure out a way to put like a speed limiter on like, Oh hey, you're not allowed to run. So you guys got there. What makes sense? But people were getting hurt and it just didn't, didn't make sense. I'd be jacked up my back and like it, it's cool. Like I get it. I kind of wish they still had it because I was good at that part. Cause like I'm going to doors halfway and I'm kind of strong so for, so for me it worked out pretty well. Uh, and then they have the obstacle course, which is like crawling under barb wire stand shoot. And then you're doing like, um, you know like sand bag over the shoulder, 20 reps shoot 30 burpees and for the obstacle course you have a 50 pound pack or a 40 pound pack on your back.

Speaker 1:          02:03:41       They kind of adjust the pack weight based off which division that you're in. But so you're using a smaller packs. So I use the kefauver packet. They again, they just had like a smaller pack. Same thing. You've got to sand bag. It was a lighter sandbag. So you carrying that through the whole course, but you're stopping and shooting along the way. So it's like you're, you're learning how to, just imagine if you, if you were like rushing up a hill and we got to the top of the hill and he got to calm your heart way, call him your nervous system very quickly and get your shot off. And granted, you're not necessarily going to be hall on a sandbag up that hill and doing a bunch of burpees, but it's kind of simulating that of shooting with your heart rate elevated. Um, and it's, it's a hard course.

Speaker 1:          02:04:18       I mean like there are like legitimate, you know, hardcore crossfitters and athletes that do this, but it's a combination of being able to shoot well and being able to, to fitness. Well, that's the interesting thing about bowhunting, is it bow hunting really does require fitness. Well when I did that high country, yeah, I was, I was wearing this, this ring we were talking about when did the hunt in Hawaii and I did it like 46 miles over the course of five days, just like crawling and walking and hiking and sprinting. I mean that's, that's why I like bow hunting is it's the challenge and the uh, the train to hunt Guy, uh, Kenton, he told me about these competitions and I was watching them and I'm like, I really want to try this. Cause at that point I'd firearms hunted for two years. I didn't grow up hunting.

Speaker 1:          02:05:03       I grew up homeschooled playing chess and playing the violin, reading books and playing world of warcraft. Like I, I was, I was not like a hunter kid growing up and neither of my parents, right. Like we'd occasionally go fishing for trout and that was about it in the, in the stock pond. So hunting when it was new for me, I'd been hunting for two years. Totally self taught. Like I feel dressed my first animal with the little youtube video on the iphone. You following along? I've got my knife and I'm watching the video because that's the way I was being homeschooled. Right? Like I like to teach myself things. I just grew up as a very independent learner so I'll, all of my hunting was salt type benefit. Yeah. It, there's, there are drawbacks to being very resistant to learning from others or having mentors.

Speaker 1:          02:05:45       I think that you also don't play well with others. Right? Like I grew up as it, when I got to college I was very poor. Like the team activities you did weren't socialized very good at creating at leading edge, thinking outside the box at, at, you know, kind of, kind of being a lot more independent rather. That's fascinating cause that's what we're doing. That's what you did is what I wound up doing. And also I read a copious amount. I wrote a copious amount and that's still what I do because that's what I, that's what I kind of grew up doing. Homeschooled. Uh, and it was really tennis that got me into fitness. Like I played tennis in college and I got big into tennis in high school and in, in Idaho where I was at the time, there is a rule that homeschooled kids could play sports at the local public school.

Speaker 1:          02:06:29       So I played tennis and that really got me into sports. And then I studied exercise physiology and biomechanics in college and, and here I am, but this, I'm like going from being homeschooled to hanging out with public school kids. Really Awkward. Like I because you're not, you're not in class with them, you're not at the prom, you're not, you're not doing any of the social things that they're doing. But then you might show up at like, you know, tennis practice or whatever and same thing we get to college. You're just not used to, I mean like do, I went off the deep end in college because I graduated, I was 15 and I didn't do like a gap year or anything, right? Like I just started college when I was 16 and I did not have good self control around sex and alcohol and drugs and all these things that all of a sudden I was immersed in in college.

Speaker 1:          02:07:13       So no one was there to tell, you know? Yeah. The way I raised my kids is they, for example, there are, there are really no rules in our house, right? Like they can try Ramin Scotch and whiskey and they can take a hit off the vape pen that they can, they're nine. But they also have been educated about what that might do to their liver or to the gray matter in their, or we don't say no gluten. I tell them you'll gluten is gonna affect your test stores. Cores creates neural inflammation, can create some gastric inflammation. You get to choose when you go to the birthday party, whether you're going to have the gluten. And sometimes it comes back to bite me because we'll go out to a restaurant and they'll bring the bread out to the restaurant and they boys would be like, no, no, we don't want the, we don't want the bread.

Speaker 1:          02:07:52       And I'm like, but I kind of wanted a little kind of did on my little piece of bread here. So that I think that's a better way to raise a child. Right? You educate them about the consequences of their decision and then you let them make the decision themselves. You equip them rather than creating a bunch of forbidden fruit, which is the way that I was kind of raised Riley. So, so yeah, it was a little tricky, the whole college thing. Um, but uh, back to back to bow hunting, it was this train hunting and Kenton came up to my house and I asked him about like kind of like the spear fishing. Like what's, what's the ball? What release do I get? What areas do I get? How would I do this? I went to the, my local boat shop. I took some lessons in shooting.

Speaker 1:          02:08:31       Um, and then I, my first hunt, uh, what was my first hunt side from my property, cause I'm on 10 acres, maybe like a copious amount of white tail. So I shot my first animal out there. My first major hunt was high country, Colorado. We did like a horseback hunt with a guide there, you know, and that got me hooked. If this was a, this was elk came back after seven days with nothing. That was my very first time. So, and then my first actual kill I hunted access stare down in Texas. Amazing. Amazing. Texas is crazy. And it tests the, I was telling you that have like fricken zebra as you can look down there. I know they have everything. Yeah. The came back and Neil Guy and African animals and my wife bought us a sausage maker and me and my boys made made access deer sausage and the backdrop and it was amazing.

Speaker 1:          02:09:18       And now, now they're little, they're little chef's dude like they uh, that's cool. They made like bone broth click made baked donuts out of breadfruit flour and they use bone broth and claustrum and they made like a cream cheese ginger frosting and a dark chocolate cow frosting and it actually tastes like real donuts. What was this from a recipe? Yeah, from a restaurant. They had like don't have you baking them colossal doughnut recipe. We've made it up. Yeah. And they use breadfruit flour forever. They did a, they do pad Thai, but they use those Shirataki noodles I was talking about. And they use organic roasted crickets like instead of shrimp or chicken. And the crickets actually tastes really good. They'll like, yeah, they're not raising the crickets. They're not, uh, I think it's called [inaudible] is the company that they get the crate and they're really good.

Speaker 1:          02:10:07       They like send you, these little kids are good man. Thanks. Crickets. Yeah. And they're doing like in Mexico Zilcho and yeah. Crickets or they're actually really tasty. Yeah. It was a place to go to Mexico and they give them to like, it's a little appetizers and leaving your room go to this resort early. Yeah. They look, it's like a fried cricket. It's an appetizer. It's like, it's like the resorts you go to with the apples and the mango covered and the cell on the thing, but instead it's crickets. But they have that, they have crickets to wow. And they, it's very tasty. They're dark and they're somehow or another cooked, I don't know what their seasons stainable mineral rich source of protein. Yeah. Yeah. And I don't see the thing about most people that are like, they don't want animals to die. They don't usually give a shit about bugs.

Speaker 1:          02:10:51       Yeah. Yeah. Dot. A lot of people find like a June bug. Super Cute and cry when it, when it gets killed. Miskino vegans just slap mosquitoes are on their arms. Yeah. I read a study this morning of gene editing mosquitoes now. Yeah. You're using crispr technologies to make the mosquitoes less likely to bite you. I saw that. Crazy. Yeah. It's very bizarre. Yeah. And if you, there was a little cool little anecdote from that study to where they found that mosquito is actually have like a, like they learn if you swat at the mosquito, it actually learns to avoid you. And so if, if you, you know, normally I just like put some on my skin like cinnamon essential oil or something that drives a mosquito away. Does that work? But yeah, it does. And you, you, you want to, you want to dilute it because it's like a very, it's a burning oil, but cinnamon works amazingly if you ever tried it.

Speaker 1:          02:11:34       And like Alaska where they have like really aggressive mosquitoes around. I don't know why we're where there's a lot of mosquitoes, different animal and work for me. But then the Alaska, no, that's on my bucket. Ours and they swarm you like a pack of Zhan. Laska doesn't seem like a place I would envision having these like special snow. No, live very long. So they're incredibly aggressive. Hmm. I mean I'm telling you, it's the weirdest thing I've ever seen. We went salmon fishing there, me and my friend Ari and we opened up the car door to get out and the time it take to open the car door, a swarm of mosquitoes was inside of the car. And I'm not exaggerating. Several hundred mosquitoes like goodness show. That sounds like that video that you pulled up once we were talking about this with the clouds of mosquitoes in Alaska.

Speaker 1:          02:12:16       Fucking crazy. Sounds like the graph. Like when I grew up, I grew up in Lewiston, Idaho and we would get these grasshopper infestations. They like each year. Yeah. Locus. And they apparently they plant their eggs in the ground and then like in the spring or the summer they hatch. Yeah. That's mosquitoes and Alaska. Wow. Dude, I'm telling you. It's the cray. What's a fucking burned by mosquitoes? It already getting jammed. My goodness dude. I'm telling you I'd never seen anything like it and we were covered with ddt and all that shit. But yeah, the terrible the deet. Do you know about Therma sells their sticks? I do now. I think, uh, I, uh, I've been using them cause my, my kid's camp outside sometimes, you know, in the, in the forest. And I said to one of those little thermacell things in front of their, they're amazing.

Speaker 1:          02:13:05       Yeah. Wow. Is that why you're the first like that? I have no idea that Caribou uh, yeah, the grasshoppers at our house and loosed and we would actually go sell them to pet stores. Like that's how we make money in the summers because it'd be so many of them. Me and my brothers would walk around with cages. She's grasshoppers and bringing a pet stores, we'll use them for like tarantulas and stuff like that. And then this army guy who was in the military came to her house and he showed us how they eat grasshoppers. So we started eating grass hoppers and we like it everything, right? Like we'd microwave grasshopper, just figure out every way to kill a grass hopper. And the way that we got rid of him was we introduced praying mantis and chicken to our property and both of those mother fuckers a, a bunch of chickens.

Speaker 1:          02:13:44       And then we have chickens at our property up in spokane now too, which I have a chicken. Eggs. Yeah, Icelandic chickens. They're very, very hardy. Oh, the winter. And then the goats that we have, our Nigerian dwarf goats and Nigerian dwarf goats. They're very small goat and they produce a lot of milk for their actual size. And they're very hardy in the winter and they're small and they're cute. And we haven't milked them yet because they need to be a, that they have to be pregnant to produce the milk. And we've had some issues with like the baby's dying and they'll be like, we're, we're, we're learning our goat game. However, we did have to tie rubber bands around a bunch of their testicles recently to, to newt or some of the males. Once you get them in front of that light training, we're training the males to be pat goats.

Speaker 1:          02:14:27       Yeah. Or Him. So you're killing their balls with rubber bands. Right, exactly. It's dude. Very, very you guys. Oh they're adorable. There's a little Nigerian dwarf goats and we have like little tires, little tires that they play on. Their seeds are kids. My kids love it, but over each other. They named him after candy bars, like Mnm and caramel and Milky Way and toffee. Did you buy them just for pets or did you buy it? We have a lot them originally for milk cause you know, goat milk, it's very, you know, the protein is smaller. It's very thermodynamically, uh, compatible with the hidden by apparently the only one that's better as camel milk really was a company out of California. It was sending me camels, smoked in my house for awhile and apparently it's super duper healthy for you. And it's, and the protein is smaller, more absorbable and, and it's less hypoallergenic.

Speaker 1:          02:15:15       And friendly to your immune system? Well, when my daughter was young she could not digest actual cow milk. It just really didn't agree with her. But goat milk was fine. It's one of those we found an I started drinking goat milk. I just, it just tastes better. You know what I like is the colostrum your reuse colostrum. Oh Jamie shows basically just like playing, what is this goat yoga? People do yoga with goats. They apparently find it relaxing. I would get so big you can do a down dog and he got like a cloven hooves and you're under cervical. It's, it's really popular. Matt. I think I would get a kick out of that. Distract you. Look at the, let's let people, yeah, this looks like something people who have never been on a farm would do. They're like goats yoga. Yeah, exactly. Yeah. Like you walk out of starbucks Frappuccino and they go sit with the goats.

Speaker 1:          02:16:09       Exactly. The great system out there though. It sounds awesome. Wild animals out there. Good set up. And then I have an obstacle. I built an obstacle course cause I do all this obstacle course race and you know what's cool is you can take all these little little bow targets and you set them up around the obstacle course. So you'll like climbing the rope and come down and then you shoot your bow and then even do practice like standing still though and working on your form and doing that as well. We got tired. Yeah, exactly. It's, it's meditative. I would like to have John's very relaxed, ugly sit down with you and go over this idea cause you also trigger, shoot, you're not, you're not using a surprise release. I haven't. I took one class at my boat shop on surprise release and I like it and I get it.

Speaker 1:          02:16:55       And frankly I feel like there's a lot less strain in the shoulder when you pull back because for a while I was getting like some of the show, like some of the brachialis issues from, from pulling back. Why would it be different? You know how when you do a lat pull down and if you grip thumbs off, used more of the latter. If you grip thumbs on, you use more the more the biceps and the forearm muscles. Right. I felt like it was similar to that. I felt like with the, with the surprise release, I was using more of my back and less than my forearm and biceps. I don't know if there's something to that, but it doesn't make any sense because the draw is exactly the same way. The only difference is to release. Yeah. Yeah. It felt a lot different. The thing about archery is it's like martial arts in that if you learn the wrong way, it's very difficult to unlearn.

Speaker 1:          02:17:36       Like when I was teaching martial arts, it was way better to get someone who is open minded, who had never had any martial arts experience versus someone who had many, many years in a shitty martial art because those people had these deeply ingrained pathways that were, whenever the shit we get weird or they would get uncomfortable or that it gets nervous, they would go back to their old technique. Yeah. Yeah, it makes sense. Yeah. Treats. It's very dirty. There's, there's also a series of a instructionals that can show you, um, about a surprise at least is that John Dudley's done put online and there's a guy named Joel Turner that has this whole dedicated thing to avoiding target panic and a high pressure situations is he's got a website, it used to be called iron mind hunting, but now he calls it shot Iq I think is an iron mind.

Speaker 1:          02:18:26       The people to sell the captains of crush hand grip strengtheners I think that's another, another company. But I love those guys. I have, I have a bunch of travel with them. Those up 197 pounds, I don't know, mine, I think mine might be like 150 years by about two things. I travel with one of the areas, uh, you know, it was like those power lungs and then you breathe in and out of to strengthen the, the experts in inspiratory muscles and the diaphragm and then a captains of crush. And so if I'm on long, like a long road trip and I got to drive a long time, I go back and forth between the hand grip strengthener and then the lung strength. I'll just like work out for like two hours while you're driving. That's awesome. It's amazing you put put on a good book and the work, the grip and work the lungs.

Speaker 1:          02:19:02       Yeah. I'm a big believer in those grip things. I mean it just makes your hands so much stronger. And the captains of crush, I mean they don't fuck around. Those are really hard and you combine that with the apnea so you pass out a few times and a super safe, safe way to drive. Just like you got to sweat, you're blue in the face. You can't even grip the steering wheel cause your grips gun. Yeah. Well we're all short on time here, but I would feel like we could probably talk for about six days and you would never run out of things to talk about. That's fun. Yeah. How often are you around here, man? We've got to do this again. Uh, that often. Not that often. Not that I avoid La. I like it up and spoken. Oh yeah. What I do is when I travel like batch stuff here or like I'm just like back to back, like I shot four documentaries yesterday and then, you know, talk the day before, like I batch a lot of meetings and then go home.

Speaker 1:          02:19:47       So I'll go a, I'll go out to Malibu tonight and then I'm going to go to uh, uh, that, that human garage treatment on uh, on the 31st and record a podcast for a second because I've been following those guys online, the cumin garage and it seems really fucking interesting. Weird. It goes back and forth. Like I've had some people telling me like that it's like cultish, right? That cause because you go in there and you gotta be like a member of their tribe and, and they, but I have never, I've never experienced anything like that and I, I'm not quite sure what people mean when they say that. That's also big profile. You're a famous fitness guy. It may be they let you slide, I don't know, but I enjoy it. They like fill you full of like high dose catechumen before you go in so your muscles just like melt and then they have like four massage therapists working on you at the same time.

Speaker 1:          02:20:38       And they taught me this how like if one's like rubbing your head in a clockwise direction but the other guys mashing on your adductor with their elbow, you don't feel the mashing on the addict or as much because like the, the movement on your head is distracting you from that and then somebody else is working on your leg and they have like all these essential oils that they fill the air with their like special oils that that causes you to relax and be a little bit more open to the deep tissue work and everybody, they're like goes through a special treat. I mean I liked it so much. I actually, I, I flew one of their guys up to my house to work on me at my house. They're doing it right. That's me. What is that? That's it. Is that, yeah, that's there. That's there.

Speaker 1:          02:21:18       Yeah, exactly. That's scary. And he like put on the first time I was there, he was like working on my back and he worked on my back by putting on a rubber glove and under the, I actually have had that intro intro but massage. Okay. They worked on it. They know they work on your, on your pelvic floor. It's pelvic floor therapy inside your advocates' tight just like anything else. So they go through your asshole to get, go into your assets. Something that appropriately a lot of times we're like, no, I had a girl down in Hawaii do it. Uh, I was uh, Gabby racist trainer. Like she actually, she does like dry needling and intra therapy. Yeah. And uh, uh, she also, she had me by like this glass tool so I can do it myself. So I do this and I go in through my butt and I do massage.

Speaker 1:          02:22:02       It sounds weird, but it actually is, that shit gets tight glasses smooth. I don't know. It has these pause, the metal, the fum putting glass in your asshole. The scene. One of those faces of death videos. Isn't that like, what are those? Uh, my roommates in college used to run it. Those so horrible. Some would die. No, there's a, there's a video of a guy who stuck a bottle up his ass. And then if the bottle breaks, it's one of those I stop at Thc suppositories and and actual tissue devices. Yeah, glass rods. Um, anyways, the uh, yeah, the human guards, they went in through, through my mouth to work on my back, like back through your mind going through your mouth, like [inaudible] old rubber glove and they're like working on the different areas. You know how to like if you work on like your, your infraspinatus or your Terry's minor in your shoulder, it can actually get rid of pain on the front of your shoulder.

Speaker 1:          02:22:50       Like there are certain trigger points. Yes. And it's very similar. Like there are certain trigger points on the head that refer to like the back or the so ass. It's really interesting. I think this whole idea behind Stasha and trigger points and how, what when you're working on one area, it actually affects another area. Well, I got rolfing done a few times when I had some pretty bad back injuries and a, I found that to be pretty interesting. Yeah, very painful. Yeah. I haven't had any rolfing done. I had it from a giant dude too. I've ever had. I've ever had rolfing. I use a lot of those vibrating foam rollers and vibrating deep tissue devices though I'm a big, big fan. Most of the time you're not going somewhere to get deep tissue. Yeah, most of the time I do my own and I just started to begin to have a massage therapists come to my house once a week cause I think like there there's a certain amount of relaxation that you get when somebody else is working on you and you're laying down on a table and I have like this, this used to like a bio mat bio mat, like purchase a bunch of heat.

Speaker 1:          02:23:52       So I laid down on the Bio Mat and I put on my Michael Tyrrell and a diffuse essential oil and have her work on me for a couple of hours. Usually I'll have her come over after dinner, like around seven 38 o'clock and you know, like after the family's kind of wrapped up and, and she'll just work on me at night and they go to bed. Who in? You're fascinating, dude. I'm glad we got a chance to talk some daily cools talk. That's a, that's a sick techno hunt set up. Yeah, it was a lot of fun day. Thank you very much for doing this. Appreciate it. Said people can find you on your website wherever. Just Google, twitter, all those places, Huh?
