Speaker 1:          00:00:00       A lot of people like when they do, you know, like did you stand up? They do jokes. Is very few people telling like long stories like you do that or the best favorite shoe was that like did the Berlin, was that Berlin would do both. He would mix it up. He'd do and what not. Jokes, jokes. Highland. We do like one liners. You know, he did whatever he thought was funny. Sam Kass and bill Cosby though was probably the most influential bill Cosby and oddly enough, Spalding gray. Probably the most influential. What happened to that guy? Didn't he die? He killed himself. Yeah, I think he, well, I think, you know, I don't know if he could prove that sort of thing, but they think he drowned himself off the ferry. He didn't get, it obviously had a lot of issues, issues and whatnot, but I enjoy, joy has his readings.

Speaker 1:          00:00:44       If you've never heard or listened to theirs, you can listen to terrors of pleasure, monster and a box. Of course he eats in a box, came to prominence with a, it was swimming to Cambodia but monster and a box is fucking riveting and it's literally a dude telling a long story and I loved it. It's like an hour and a half, two hours maybe or something like great to have something different like that and he just let you sit there and you can't, I mean you can watch a video version of that that believe exists, but I always listened to it and it was just magical. The idea of like a dude who's essentially telling one very long joke that's has highs and lows, emotional beats and makes you sad and that gets real. Like every once in a while he throws and you're laughing and he'll just stop you dead with like my mother killed herself and you know, Blah Blah Blah.

Speaker 1:          00:01:31       And he just derails the comedy and you forget like, Oh shit, this dude's not a comic. He's literally storytelling. And so I appreciated that and I appreciate it. Bill Cosby, my favorite comedy bits of all time is the one side of that album to Russel, my brother who has slept with it's, I don't know if you've ever heard it, but it's so fucking hysterical. It's bill Cosby's I guess how long was the side of a record back in the day for 40 minutes or something. 45 one side. I don't remember. 30 member man maybe. Cause he was, he wouldn't flip sides when you had a good long record. Right Faye? I'm want to say 30 minutes Max. I don't know. But this should be, she Google this for somebody going here in this room. This piece is the whole side of an album and it's essentially him telling a story about him and his little brother trying to go to sleep.

Speaker 1:          00:02:16       Um, when they were kids and the interplay with their father. And it's so, it is, it's spellbinding like he paints the picture puts you're right there in the room. He never curses. Dude. Never uses a sexual innuendo, nothing. Not Know are the tricks that like if I had to do it straight like him, I could never have done. Never have done it. Still can't do it to this day. And he drops science for that entire bit. It is, it's brilliant. It's so low. It's hysterical. He's absolutely adorable as the kids and he's playing both of them and stuff. Do yourself a favor, listen to it. That was very inspirational for me too. I was like, look, I could do this if this was kind of comedy.

Speaker 2:          00:03:00       I think I could do this. If you could tell Lawrence Long stories, even as chicken hearts shit, the go cards bit is fat Albert Buck, Buck and the ninth street bridge a bit. Bill Cosby stuff is, I know some people maybe aren't into them now, but oh my God, before he did that show long, even though I go listen to the albums, the allies or even now today, stand up is still great. I've heard people that like Chris Rock was on TV talking about it once about how he'd just gone to see him. And uh, he was, um, I think it was in the movie comedian, the Jerry Seinfeld movie. Think that's what it, so, which wasn't that long ago, 10 years ago. Said the costume, he was still sharp. He said, he goes, Chris Rock, who's one of the greatest ever. I was like, I feel like a fraud. He goes, I feel like a fraud.

Speaker 2:          00:03:40       After watching them, he goes, he just went up no opener for like two hours and he did two shows and you know, Bill Cosby's elderly gentleman. I was going to say at this point, he's gotta be like 70 still up there killing it. And the crazy thing is, I don't even think he goes anywhere to try shit out. I think he just writes it all down right to it at home, you know? And then he even said it like he does stand up on the tonight show and he literally doesn't practice the standup. He goes, I know what's funny. I especially at now, boy, crazy is that like, I know, it's funny, I'm just going to write out my entire monologue. He's a, he's an old master. You know, Bill Cosby will be a great guy if someone, I mean, I wouldn't subscribe to all of his principals because he's really into clean comedy and I really appreciate good dirty comedy too.

Speaker 2:          00:04:25       I'm sorry. I appreciate good clean comedy and like again, he's a master master. I can't do it, but that's not my favorite. I gotta be honest. I, I, if I had a choice between listening to Kozian Kennison one of the reasons why we choose Kennison is cause he would go deep. He would go take me to crazy places. And that's what I want to do. I've got a couple of drinks in me. I want, I want to hear you talk about Jesus's last might words, but not my, I mean, I want to talk about Philly. Yeah. Talk about like heat. The relationship shit he did was really, really fucking Carlin Carlin and his book and that sort of biography book. I think he talks about Kennison. Either that or I was watching an interview the Carlin did with, um, uh, John Stewart before he was just, or Jon Stewart.

Speaker 2:          00:05:09       Um, for some anniversary or some maybe it aspen comedy fest, and he said that Kennison was the one that made him step his game up. Wow. Karlyn was just like, when I see he's a very rarely to like a comic, like bomb away, but he loved comics, but Kinison was the one that made him go, oh shit. Like I should have, why didn't I do that? You know, why don't you move to where the fucking food is? Did you ever read his brother's book? No. How is it? It's awesome. It's called Bro. My brother Sam is very Sam, very honest, very honest and very, very insightful. But one of the things that he says is it, Sam got hit by a car when he was a little boy, I think it was a truck and after he got hit, he was never the same kid again. All of a sudden he was angry and reckless. So he literally became Sam Kennison because they got hit by a car. They said before that it was like a normal kid. But then after he got hit, all of a sudden became like reckless

Speaker 1:          00:05:58       and wild, which sometimes happens when people have head injuries. That's a, yeah, that is crazy because a head injury might've created one of the greatest comedians in the history of the known universe. Right. For Real. It's true. It's crazy to think because he was so wild. Man. Silent. Bob Wears a coat. Like I wore that trench coat because of Sam Kennison. Really? Oh my God. I love that. That's awesome. And I had a poster in my room as a kid, like he had done, I don't even know how they fucking got him to do this, but they had in school, this is, they started this in school, advertise and shit. Even back then we're talking 1988 and they'd have billboards where they would put posters in where there was some celebrity talking about read and it was sponsored by some fucking company and should everyone made out somehow.

Speaker 1:          00:06:46       But ultimately the message was good. Whatever the message was meant to be for high school or passing by in the hallway. Sam Kennison was on one of them. And to think about that Sam Kinison and inspirational high school poster. It was just kind of, if you've no Sam kinisons work at all, it's just lunacy. Wow. I don't know how it happened. He must have had a hell of an agent or manager who's like, I got you this Gig. And I dunno if anyone remembers it, but May. But I remember I was a huge fan. I'd seen him on Snl, like he did that fucking crushing. I'd seen him around the Rodney Dangerfield special, but on SNL he came out and he fucking, they had to bleep them and shit like that. He was legendary already. And there he was in this poster. And I remember going to the principal and be like, can I have this when they take it down?

Speaker 1:          00:07:30       And so he gave me the poster and I had it in my room for the longest time. And even though it was like he couldn't curse on it, it was about, you know, fucking doing your best or whatever, being your own person. It was classic Kinison Yell Pose, you know, of the, ah, so I had it in my room. I start wearing trench coats because Kennison he made a little Paris. We went up to New York City to when they, uh, in Manhattan down in the village. Was that place like vintage, not vintage vinyl. I'd be a record store, but it was about clothes, old clothes, vintage clothes and bought old trench coats and shit. Trying to look like Sam Kinison. Wow. Is there a return of Jay and silent Bob in the work anytime ever? No. We do the podcast now. We've kind of taken the character's and turn them into, I guess title more than anything else.

Speaker 1:          00:08:19       Did you ever have a script for it? And like, I like another one. There was like, no, there was no script for it. But like every once in a while you'd muse about like, well maybe this would be funny or I'd do this. And they started getting more and more ridiculous and that's what I knew it was time to stop. Plus we're getting older. It's kind of tough to pull that off at like fucking, I love it. 40 yeah, did, but don't rule it out. If you smoke a fatty one day and you're sitting in a Jacuzzi and he goes, it's the character. I'd like to get to see the character. You can do that in cartoon form. I would love to live forever. That's true. It's easier, but I would love to see it from the place where you're at. You know? I would love

Speaker 2:          00:08:56       to see you. I don't eat none of it. That's the, I don't know. That might be the danger. Like Jane Silent. Bob were not written by a stoner, and at least that's what I learned to ask you about at that point. You know, maybe they don't work if they're written by a stoner. I interrupted you earlier when you were talking about, we were talking about the, you know, what's the difference now? You know, and that three years later, like now you're, you've been smoking weed for how long now? I started 30 38 1938 no, no. Page 38 so that was, I'm sorry, 1998 yeah, nine he started in 98 that's when you really started smoking weed. No, I'm sorry, 2008 I have 2008 years off. Yeah. I was baffled because I thought I'd heard that Seth Rogan got you into it. That was a, I was doing the math in my head going, wait a second, I leave off.

Speaker 2:          00:09:39       Hire you. You left off very at all. God Damn Day. I'm bad at math, but B, I skipped a decade in my head all the time. All the time. You, Oh God, I forget to do that on checks. No, just when the conversation always in talking about something where I'm like, oh, but that was like 90 something. They're like Kevin. Then we had a whole decade and now we're into a new decade cause you start, once you start getting to the bubbly start making entertainment there, there is no more calendar for either schedules, you know, shooting, scheduled, but ain't no more calendar. You don't look at the calendar the way everybody else does and the idea of 2000 still hard to sink in and then 2011 what? Really? 2000 seems like we're living in the future. You remember that ACDC Song? No, no. Ace freely song, don't you know, my two Railey's comment, ace freely, uh, was I think it was on his solo, uh, when he was a with kiss and they all branched off into Solo.

Speaker 2:          00:10:30       Right. But talk at singing about some guy in the future. He was singing about a 2000 man guy flying around jet cars and shit. You know, I remember being, I was born in 70 and so it was very easy to do the math because you know, every 10 years you were, whatever the decade was, you were kind of giving kind of be that age or at least have the number involved. So I would always say like I'm in in the year 2000, I'll be 30. Cause I could do that for simple math. And that seemed like such a far way fucking concept. And now we're 11 years past it. Yeah. Like the oldest I thought I could ever imagined I could be. I tell people I'm 44 and then I have to go, Ooh, that's not good. It doesn't matter anymore. How much longer is this going to last?

Speaker 2:          00:11:17       Yeah. Well when it does matter manage, you know, pain or no, he's still in very good shape and I take care of my Iranian or work out, but I have to, if I don't take care of it, it drops off quick. Now that's what I'm noticing. If I get injured and I can't work out for a couple of weeks now, whoa. When I come back it's like I'm fucking starting from scratch man. I come back, I'm a pussy like, like really? Just two weeks, two weeks I lose like half of my cardio. It's crazy. Two weeks you get exhausted like really quickly and it's like you have to build your body back to some sort of artificial level of functionality in order to do like martial arts and things at my age. And if you don't,

Speaker 3:          00:11:54       it's not going to work anymore. You Shit starting to break son a year a year, your artificial functionality must look like, I must look like the bionic man compared to my best, absolute best, the focus thing. I just been doing it since I was like, I started doing martial arts when I was a real little kid. So by the time I was 15 years old when I really got really got obsessed, I was, I was in the sophomore year of high school and that's when I really, really truly got obsessed with martial arts. From that time. I've always been training. That's a long time. Think about it. Yeah, it's for me it's like, you know, some people go and they play basketball. Some people go and you know, they'll, they'll the meet some friends and they'll go play golf together. I go and do Jujitsu. To me it's an, it's a normal thing.

Speaker 3:          00:12:39       It's like it's, you know, going to and training in martial arts, it's like, you know, it's how I get my aggressions out. It's how I straightened my mind out. At the end of the day. It's how, when you know, when you're in the face of something very difficult like sparring with someone, when you're doing Jiu Jitsu sparring, you're forced into this sort of a moving meditation, sort of a, a zone. You know, where you can only think about what you're doing. You have to figure out a way to manage your resources because you're in a hand to hand combat battle with a skilled man, right? And you guys are going back and forth to each other and you try to choke each other and it's very intense. But in doing that very intense thing, you lose yourself in the movements and you hit this sort of a zen state and you can only hold it for like a certain amount of time for you get fucking exhausted.

Speaker 3:          00:13:25       And the key, the key is holding that moment for as long as possible. Keeping it going for as long as possible. So you gotta do like strength and conditioning and Chin ups and dips and fucking kettlebells and all this shit is just to get in there so you can go deeper and deeper with the Jujitsu so he can tap people. When you were in tapping him, avoid being tapped when you were getting tapped. So you, you have to tune you. It's almost like your effort and your will is what powers your race car. Instead of just being able to, you know, go to the track and get a new engine or whatever the fuck you do. You know your effort and your will determine what your physical body can do. So it's this crazy game that you get stuck and get addicted to and this game is just seniors and you're fucking love it.

Speaker 3:          00:14:05       I love learning new shit, man. I love working with different kickboxing trainers and learn a new shed because when you, when you learn anything, I believe it elevates everything. I really believe that. I believe that the more excellence you can get in your body and your mind in your day, the better everything is. I think that the better you'll feel, the better you'll be. You know, you'll, you'll project better energy out there. You'll be nicer to people, they'll be nice with you. I really believe that. I think in getting great at something, in finding, even if just attempting to improve at something, you're always going towards the right direction. You're always using positive energy. You are always using discipline. You always getting results in improving anything. When you see those results that reinforces this, this in in you, you and your whole existence to push forward and be positive and create and, and resolve things and figure things out and reach your pinnacle.

Speaker 3:          00:15:01       You know? So I think all that stuff like that's why I got this tattoo. I think it's all connected. What is it? The book of the Seven Ring Book of five rings. Fiber, the Moto moto-massage you fucking rings in the, yeah. Maybe you're the fucking next guy going to contribute to it. What is the subway way? What are the explaining the title? The five ranks? No, I don't know. You'd have to like really get into her nod. I don't, I don't know what he's, this dude was a Ronin. Yeah, he was around how to, a story on what happened and African banks bitches and writes poetry for real. It just got tired of Chubb and be Blob and he wrote a book. That was it. He was just like, you know, I killed a lot. Now I'm just going to, yeah. I wrote a book on how to be a carpenter and how to be a fucking philosopher and had to be in anything really follow that book.

Speaker 3:          00:15:39       It's an amazing book if you can figure out, you see, it's so hard when you translate from Japanese to American to really know his words. You would really have to learn Japanese and understand the difference in the, you know, the way things are worded. You know when you translate you, you get a rough estimate of what the guy was saying. It would have to be in the context of his culture and you take it in the context of the context of the time that he existed and it's an amazing insight into an exceptional individual. It's an amazing insight into like a guy who had reached a height clearly that no one around him had with this sword fighting thing, which is so intense and that you, you, there's no room for bullshit and sword fighting. You can't pretend you're better than you are. There's no bullshitting.

Speaker 3:          00:16:18       There's no need to talk shit. Okay, this is all going down with steel. That's going to be moving at like 50 miles an hour towards your fucking face. Yeah. You got to be absolutely 100% sure of the correct technique. How to do, how to avoid and get in there and get your shit done and survive. This is not tennis bitch. That's insane. To live a life like that, finding people with fucking swords until we've done it successfully. I think it was 62 times it was the number that he supposedly killed and then be like, it's time to become a writer. Could you imagine somebody put publishes that book and somebody gives them a bad review? It's just like there's occasionally, there's a guy like that that will exist in martial arts. There's these occasional guys that will stand out above and beyond all the rest.

Speaker 3:          00:17:01       Hixon Gracie is the last one. He's the the the premier member of the Gracie family. You know the Gracies. You ever heard of them for the ultimate fighting championship? Now you're completely out of the loop. That's awesome. Yeah. I'm, I'm, I'm bear on virgin month. Wow. I knew there was people like you out there. I knew. I'd heard it up, but that's, that's not even just for UFC or mixed martial arts. Any spots, any sports beyond hockey, hockey do, but everything else like you know, they'll be like, oh, this guy, they, and they'll say a name and it's a name that I've heard for fucking years, but I don't know what sport the Duplos. What made you, what made you be this? Um, what did that way? Yeah. What made you be broken? All your, look, I'm the worst. Here's mine. Professional Pool and fighting. That's it.

Speaker 3:          00:17:46       That's all I watched. That's awesome. I don't know anything else. If you are a guy in another sport, either you have to talk a lot of shit like that Oto Cinco guy or you have what is, get arrested for something. What does he play? He's a football player. Okay. I was going to guess base and then Michael Vick gets arrested for killing dogs, so I know who he, yeah, totally. Definitely the infamous Oj Simpson. I've heard this. I heard of that guy. Yeah. This, like if they're, you're not a boxer or a kickboxer, but I know some obscure little Japanese guys at fight and some, you know, weird circuit over in Japan. I know, I know I've done the name of a lot of different fighters. I've caught a lot of that information in my head. But no sports guys

Speaker 1:          00:18:20       never had that. Never been a sports dude, wasn't it?

Speaker 3:          00:18:23       But you are because you're your hockey. Like I could say I'm not a sports do either, but I obviously am cause I'm into mixed martial arts.

Speaker 1:          00:18:28       I'm more about the philosophy of hockey than anything else. What does this mean for as a more as an idea, as an idea I the philosophy of hockey, I mean as it's kind of the philosophy of life. You have a goal. Someone's in your way, don't let them stop you. Score. Like that's just the very base clear. I don't think it needs to go much deeper. I think that's kind of the beauty of the poetry of it. Now you tie that to one of the most graceful, beautiful games on the planet and played with physical excellence. I mean, I understand it. You need to be on your fucking game to step into a ring with a dude who could fucking kill you with his fist. But when you dial it down to a game that's, you know, less lethal and stuff and more just about moving a ball or a puck around that sport takes is probably the greatest athleticism I think to play any sport.

Speaker 1:          00:19:14       Because think about it just to stand in skates, you're using more muscles than most people actually use on a regular basis. So even if you're not doing anything in the game, you are ready. You have to be athletically inclined just to stand there. Now add to it, they play tops. What two minutes shifts? Usually some one minute shifts to hardcore. Think about how hard you have to skate in order to go back and forth. Think about the running that you'll do on a football field or basketball court. Rather. Let's go with the basketball court. Um, you know its foot on trial. You're used to running. Now try that with skates now. Stop now go back quick now wait, go back the other way. You're puck chasing the whole time. Like that's why they have those quick shifts because who could stand that? You have to be so physically in shape to do that and it's beautiful to watch people do that beautiful graceful look like shit. You know they're skating across the giant diamond or some such shit, you know? And they're on water. There's this miracle, this element of like, what do you mean it's water? Like it's water, but it's hard water. You know? It's just everything about it really speaks to me. It's fine.

Speaker 3:          00:20:21       Damn you making me a hockey fan. I'm ready to go watch some fucking hockey.

Speaker 1:          00:20:24       It's humble too. You know what I'm saying? Like hi hockey played. Most athletes are very fucking like, you know a big shades on and they don't want to talk to cameras and stuff. Lotta a Lotta, a lot of dramatics and whatnot. Hockey players aren't like that at all. Hockey players, man, you never have to hunt a hockey player down for a quote. I think when you're, I think most journalists will tell you that like their whole philosophy is very, it's not like any philosophy here in regards to baseball or football or any other sport. Philosophy is as simple sell the game. That's it. Sell the game. The, Oh, the idea of passing the game onto what? I just did a few seconds go. I sold the game so much. So they were like, yeah, I want to see that. That sounds good. Somebody should take a clip and somebody will take, take a clip of this and put it on the Internet and use it as a promo for hockey.

Speaker 1:          00:21:11       It should know. No, she got way more famous before and it'll pay attention. You have to be way more famous. Thanks. So before people, that's hilarious. How famous do you think? You are not aware. Oh, are you crazy? Listen, you're famous as fuck dude. Now yes. Now listen. I know it's uncomfortable and you want to be all underground and shit though. You have a is Ben Affleck. I have stood besides Ben Affleck and that's fucking famous. That's crazy money. That's ridiculous. Superstardom you're not that. But you're famous as fuck. It's a difference. You're famous is, fuck everyone I know knows who you are. That's ridiculous. You can't be so rarely is. It would be silly. I know you want to be humble, but you're being silly. You're famous as fuck. I don't know. I think most people like go, oh, he looks familiar, but I don't think people know they know your name.

Speaker 1:          00:21:51       Then you're famous is, fuck. I don't think anybody knows. I think our name is so crazy. Forget your cute. That's cute. Now come on, dude. It's not a recognized body. Your mind. My mom knows who you are. So many people in this life go, oh, I love, I love you on fucking King of Queens, Kevin James. You know what I'm saying to me, so that's retards. You're going to get retarded. No matter where you go. They're an unavoidable, can't factor them into the equation. You get hit by a random asteroid. That's what that is. When someone comes up to you, cause you Kevin, James, rare medieval happened not too many occasions for me to feel comfortable. You know, I fuck up with people's names too. I'm always confusing one person with another person. I'm like, Oh yeah, really shit, you know, but that's, I'm literally still dying inside because I was thinking, oh my God, it was our wardrobe person's name, Beth and I almost said Beth Pasternak and I'm like, is that her name?

Speaker 1:          00:22:37       And because that's one, remember your login you to stone. I wouldn't call it two stone, but I a stoned enough. Yeah, you give, if you're going to commit to a lifestyle, you, you give up on short term a lot where you're just like, I'm going to need help. Like I do that a lot. I find you've are fine. I don't know how if you ever do this on stage, but I tell such long fucking convoluted stories that invariably wants twice per night. Now I'll be in the middle of something and just be like, um, like I, I don't freeze it. Don't get scared anymore, but I just literally go, the fuck was I talking about? I'm so sorry. And someone will be like, ah, it was Jerry Muse in a bathtub. I'm like, Oh yes, thank you anyway. And boom right back in as long as they can help you out as long as they're there to help.

Speaker 1:          00:23:19       But if not, do there moments where you're just like, oh my God. Like I was on the tonight show earlier and I sat down to tape the tonight show and I wasn't nearly stoned enough for that. I wish I'd been more stone cause I would have enjoyed it more the whole time I'm sitting there just thinking like I look fat on the show. I know I look fat right now. I know look fat. And in the midst of it, I did have those moments where I wasn't stone, but at a moment where I was like, what the hell was I talking tonight? Show you have one of those moments.

Speaker 2:          00:23:46       Yeah. Luckily I connected it quickly, but I love doing it onstage. I used to be like, oh, you can't let people know. And I'm like, yeah, and let's be realistic. Like, Hey, I'm 41 I'm in the middle of a fucking labyrinthine story to begin with. There's so many moving parts and B, it's see you throw some weed on top of that. You know, every once in a while maybe a gear is going to slip and you're going to forget a detail, but as long as the audience is there to rescue you, it's all good. I love the fact that you're honest about it. You know, there's a lot of people that aren't honest about the positive effects of it and they treat it like it's a trivial thing. Oh, you know, when I, when I was, one of the things that I was upset with Dr drew about, and I, and I do really love Dr drew, but he's like, oh, you want to go smoke your weed?

Speaker 2:          00:24:27       Smoking weed? You know, like you say, look, I'm not telling you not to do it, but it's dismissive about it being a positive thing. It's always like, yeah, you want to go do whatever you want to do with your life. I'm for freewill. I'm for you having a good time. And if you want to ruin your thing and go, go right ahead. I'm for, but that's not your, you're not taking to account all the people that talk about these amazingly positive benefits of the half from it and you're one of them. You know, you're always talking about mine medicine man. I it and some people be like, oh, it just what it is. It fuel your creativity as a no, quite the opposite. Like I don't think I've ever gotten a new idea from weed that I wouldn't have had otherwise. What we'd allows you to do is chase the good idea, uh, and embrace it rather than let it go for fear that someone will judge it or for fear that it won't work or hey, this hasn't been done yet.

Speaker 2:          00:25:18       So I find weed doesn't make me creative as much as it knocks down the inhibitions that block creativity. Like the reason you don't go further on that cool idea because you're afraid it's going to be judged or won't turn out or who will ever buy this or what am I thinking? Or I can't pull something like this off weed. You could smoke away. Those inhibitions is a very important man that no matter how long we're here to push down all those, even the dopiest fucking fears, the things that you're like, anything in the boxes you in, like you're talking about. People like to sometimes keep that box tighter and tighter to your eyes, but it's more important to kind of understand why things happen and who invented it, what makes it work, so to speak, get to the bottom of it. And weed makes you more introspective.

Speaker 2:          00:26:01       It really does. You start looking and you start thinking, you start to elders. It creates time for me and it creates time to think. We have cannabinoid receptors in our brain. Oh, I love the scope. Go Yoda stoned to THC. You know, we know that human use of THC goes back at least 10,000 years. We, we, you know, we've, we're constantly finding like old mummies with bags of weed with them. You know, there's, there's people that believe that it had some part of the evolution of language, you know, and explain the idea of this cannabinoids receptors. All right. The idea that you've got receptors in your brain tuned in to give you eggs to tune into exactly what this marijuana plant is getting. Only that they do nothing else, but that was the also they also, I think cannabinoids can be fired up when you that runner's high too.

Speaker 2:          00:26:44       I think somehow. I know that that's very soon. You are the one telling me this far. I think it was when you were on the show, you were going and telling me like the the drug or the brain kicks in with something when you're about to die. They said, well, they believe it. It's called dimethyltryptamine. It's produced by the liver, the lungs, and they believe it's produced by the pineal gland. They're actually doing these spa like super specific studies on this shit right now because throughout all eastern mysticism they've always talked about the third on that image. Right? Of course. Well that is where the pineal gland rests and it literally is an eyeball on that from that HP Lovecraft movie from beyond, they were going after the pineal glands. A little fucking thing came out. Well, the crazy thing about that gland is that in certain reptiles and actually has a retina in a lens like it's a fucking eyeball, it is.

Speaker 2:          00:27:31       It is an eyeball and in they believe that this is what they call it, the seat of the soul. They believe it is the factory of the most potent, naturally produced psychedelic chemicals. We don't know what exactly because you have to cut into the fucking brain like within 15 minutes of someone being dead to find it. I think there's some, some crazy roadblock to finding out exactly what today's technology, where the the DMT is being manufactured in the brain, so they're trying to figure out an invent new technology to directly monitor it so they can absolutely prove it even if they don't prove it. Where, where it's manufactured. It's known that it exists in the body. It's known that it's produced by several different organs and it is known that it's intensely psychedelic. W what I found comforting about that was the way you presented it was in the moment that you are dying, your body knows that and sends it in doses. Huge. Just send me an angel. Yes, bitch. It just dopes you and the fuck out the edge. That notion that my body is like mad. Nah, he ain't going to handle this Chubby can't handle it. He's going to need to shut down. Boom, boom, boom. And then the doors of perception open up like fucking giant exploding kaleidoscopes of insane light with no boundary and you get shot through a fucking tunnel. Just like a DMT trip. Don't give transported into the center of the universe.

Speaker 2:          00:28:59       How many psychedelic experiences have you had? Never. I mean what? What? Explain mushrooms. No, don't do that. I've never done that. But you're like, wait. Yeah, I do. And I'm not even judgemental about it. Like I can't say that people that do, but I've never done it. I don't know if it would, I don't know how I would handle that. Oh, you have much to learn. Grasshopper. We were ready to straighten you out. I don't know if that's Mckenna building goes, but like the floor I'm on is frightening enough but manageable. I can't imagine what it's like. Well, 98 three years. You're just sort of coming to grips with the whole thing. You know that your, your whole life is greatly enhance and far more fascinating when you're high. And then you start thinking about, well, why aren't more people talking about the benefits of this incredible drug and why is it being demonized?

Speaker 3:          00:29:42       And you start processing in your mind. And Mushrooms are that times a million and den Dmt is mushrooms times a million plus aliens. So that's what it is. It's like, does anyone come back? Yeah, man, I'm, maybe you gotta be a weak bitch, but you might get lost. I'm not scared of the woods, Bro. I go out in the woods, I'll go out in the woods to learn something about myself. And that's what it is. It's like every, every intense psychedelic experience is like what year the benefits that you're getting from, um, marijuana is like a slow IV drip, right? This is like someone's sticking a fucking Turkey based or up your asshole and shoving it. Scary lunging into your central nervous system. Well, it's supposed to be scary because as you said, when you heard that your father scream to death, you only get one shot at this, you know, and that, that fear is the fear of losing control, which is absolutely inevitable.

Speaker 3:          00:30:39       You know, and you know it, I know it. And that you did with the psychedelic experiences or like, it's like, it allows you to almost go through a death experience several times. Not to the point where you feel dead, but to the point where you're, your whole view of the world is so shattered. Your ego is so you, your, your actual worth in your actual piece in this puzzle is made so clear and it's so humbling and it's so confusing and it's so enlightening and it's so encouraging and it's so loving and it's so frightening all at the same time, all impossible to describe the images and the feeling you get literally probably are responsible for human evolution. And there's some that game, Terence Mckenna believe that the reason, and he had at this, this documented down to climate change. He believed that the reason why human beings evolved from other hominids is that they started experimenting with new food sources and eating siliciden mushrooms and he has it all down to when the, the rain forest receded and became grasslands cause the climate change. That's when the monkeys ran out of food and they started in grasslands. It's not as rich as the rain forest. So they had to fucking experiment new food sources and that's when all these cows were walking around eating the glass. The grass cow shit out. The Shit Shit grows mushrooms on a monkeys eat the mushrooms, monkeys figure out all kinds of different shit like language and coordination and how to make tools and how to fucking throw rocks at things and killed them tools.

Speaker 1:          00:32:04       We were just on the know somebody that's a tool. No, but my wife told him this story, if I fucking capture my imagination was just kind of write up the salad. You see this dolphin story about the conch shells? No. Oh, they use them to fish? Yes. Yeah, I did hear about that. How fucking spell Vinings that these dolphins are taking these conch shells, which that was the second most surprising thing about the story. To me there was a picture, it's conch shells. Fucking huge mega conch shells is like being like this, but it's funny. So that's the thing like Whoa, why in any event these dolphins, they found them like they thought they used to go under the conch shells to fish out anything that wasn't live in their fish or what have you. But they've discovered that they're using them as tools, as trapping tools, like using them to kind of heard fish and then cup Lum and then eat out of it. So using them to capture and to dig and like not and very specific, not just like, oh he's balancing a conch shell. They're using it. They're, they're figuring tools out.

Speaker 3:          00:33:02       Yeah. How to dolphins get so fucking smart without thumbs. It's really interesting when you think about it, cause no separators in the ocean and you don't have to open the door. They're supposed to be really intelligent. Like, we don't exactly know how intelligent and some people, because I think their cerebral cortex is some large percentage larger than a human beings, like something like 40% larger than a human beings. They have. What would that mean? I don't know if they've been on a no reason better. I don't know. No, I don't think so. I think they just have like such a different world as far as their coordination and their physical movement and a like neanderthal had a bigger brain than a human bang and one of the, and they were done with us for sure, but they needed a bigger brain operate that fucking ridiculous body. Like neanderthals were very different than people. There were five foot, two, 200 pounds of solid muscle and bone. There were these big like half chimp people, you know, like if you look at like, like drawings of the [inaudible], like they don't really resemble, I mean they do, but they don't do legs and two other standing up right of they would have fucked us up if it was just like one on one brawls between the underdogs and people. Most likely neanderthals would've fucked us up. Yeah. There's some, this is some serious genetic,

Speaker 1:          00:34:05       what was I talking about? Why did I talking about man, that's what it sounds like. Yeah. What was I talking about? You're talking about a neanderthal man. Big Brain needed big brain to operate that big body. Oh, sorry. Okay.

Speaker 3:          00:34:19       It's dolphins. Brains are larger. It could be just to operate that incredible body they have. You just hit a pothole and my friend. Yeah. Good. Thank you for [inaudible] to save. Yeah, thank you. And that's what is the beautiful thing about letting the audience know that you're high and when you do those Q and A's, do you let them know, listen, I just need you as a net.

Speaker 1:          00:34:34       The nice thing about always talking about being stone is people that just assume that at all times you are. So there's a nice blanket for everything. Did you ever get to the point when you first started getting high? We, you got too high and he got really paranoid. Not Paranoid is quit. No, not quit, but I thought I'd died when I thought I was going to die. I got really stoned with my friend Jim Jackman and he came over and we were out on the deck at my house. It's night out, stars and shit sitting there smoking and I had already spoke before he got there and then he came and I was like, oh, spoke another one. This is in the days before I would smoke that much. So two joints within the span of like what? An hour and a half or something like that and by the time I got to burn down to the bottom of the second one, I was like really, really, really, really, really, really fucked up. And I kept telling him, I was like, I think this is it. I got a late, I gotta lay down like I, I think my heart might stop tonight. And he's like, you want me to do anything? I was like, no, let me just lay down. I laid down next to the pool, just on the deck looking up at the stars and I was like, I'm too high, dangerously high. I don't know what was, I'd never really experienced that again. Will that then what do you think it was?

Speaker 3:          00:35:41       Well, first of all, you probably wasn't babbling heart expanding the movie. Is that what I have? My mother never told me he's a silly, do I get to fuck Murcia till mag as well. That was that. Was that what it was? The boy had a bamboo in heart. He get to, he had a bad heart and in his parents told me that at baboons they told me those rookie highs, you don't really achieve those, those rookie highs. Once you get a tolerance, those rookie highs are like getting shot into the center of the universe. Chris Mcguire and when we got Chris Mcguire high one night behind the comedy store, do you remember the story? You were there with me. We were Chris when Chris is a buddy of mine from way back who've never gets high. He's a comic and it usually has a couple of beers that's, he'll get high if you're forced them too.

Speaker 3:          00:36:26       All right, I'll take a hit of this. He was a stone cold rookie and he took two hits of was. It was probably trainwreck cause that's all we ever smoke is ridiculous. Super space philosopher weed. And then I came back to him like 20 minutes later it goes, Yo, I got a problem. I've got a real problem here. He goes, this is not, we need somebody puts something in this man. I, I'm, I'm, this is somebody puts something in this. I'm telling you, this is not pot. I've been hunting before. This is not pot. This is serious, man. I'm serious. Somebody puts something in this. I'm like, no dude, dude, dude, dude, the weeds, they'll eat that good. And he was like, no way. That can't be real. He didn't believe it. Didn't believe it because that rookie high, the rookie high is, it's terrifying. I mean, you might as well be on ecstasy. It might as well be an asset.

Speaker 1:          00:37:08       I, I can't say that I miss it though. Like I enjoy, I never feel, I always said I don't get stoned. That's for teenagers. I get centered. I enjoy where I get now. Great Place, great for conversation, great for, like I said, knocking over d inhibitions and whatnot. Um, I'm not quite, I don't know if I'm ready to open the third eye, but if, if anyone's sold me closer to that, you don't need to do it. Nobody needs to do anything, man. That's all nonsense. You can find your own place. They need to give it a shot, but it sounds appetizing. I mean it's like, look, I'm a, I am something of a journey or now and at the end of the day it's not that far removed. We're not talking. If he's not that, you would go on like you should do some bumps and fucking rails. Dude, you're talking about another thing that's very close to what I'm doing. It's very much the same as as what you're doing. It's all the same thing. It's, it's forcing you to shake like, can I make a milk orange juice thing? Where are you crying to an orange.

Speaker 3:          00:38:03       You want to eat it? It gets really crazy because it lasts for like six hours. This is like a slow DMT release. What do you do with it though? You get, if you eat it, you have to eat it with an Mao inhibitor and you've got to know something else. How to brew that correctly. It's like you can't eat it when you, oh, when you or at when you take it in oral ACC DMT exists apparently in so many different plants that our body has a builtin defense mechanism for it. It's called Mano aiming oxidase. So when you eat something like say if you eat grass that has DMT in it, like sheep, if they eat that grass will die. It's really kind of crazy. Like sheep. If eat grass has DMT in it, they just fucking fall in their bag and stick their legs up and they tremble in the air.

Speaker 3:          00:38:40       It's really kind of Nutty, but human beings have figured out a way to process it in our stomachs and that's what this motto Amy unoxidized says. That's why we can eat it in so many different plants, but yet it's not psychoactive. What these guys in the Amazon, they figured out a way to make it psychoactive when he eat it. By combining this plant that as this one drug with an Mao inhibitor, so it kills the monoamine oxidase and your stomach and it allows your stomach to absorb this drug directly. So you have to take something in order to Hugh can, you're going to be in the jungle. There's no refrigerators. Dude. This is all bad. It's a big step. It's a big step. Let's go. You gotta be a real seeker if you want to do this.

Speaker 2:          00:39:18       Wait, I thought we got, I'm not sure. That's the oral DMT mosquito Kosha. That's the oral DMT. What do you mean all my sermons first? Don't even go. Wait, what is the mind mushroom? You Chew Right? Yeah. You just need a little mushrooms. You can make your first trip. Could I'd make like a strawberry milkshake mushroom. You can eat it with the same amount of people. Like it won't be like, oh no it,

Speaker 3:          00:39:40       you really shouldn't have food in your stomach. But as long as that is the only food that, and it'll be like probably diminish the effects, vary slightly, but ultimately it's all going to get into your bloodstream. It's good. Did you ever have a bad trip, bad trips or uh, uh, they're, they're actually, uh, and it doesn't seem like it at the time, but they're actually almost all beneficial as long as you don't go completely crazy. What you learned from a bad trip is that you've got some issues, man. You got some shit that's bugging you. You got some, some, she's got some imbalances in your mind and you are not focusing on them. That's usually what it is and it comes up or it's facing nightmarish form. It comes up in nightmarish clarity. That's what psychedelic experiences really do it when you have something that's really fucking with you, that it's, it's such a primary focus inside your mind that when you open up these doors to psychedelic dimensions, your mind is going to grab that shit and shove it in your face and go, what the fuck is this? Why you hiding this from? Why don't you get this shit out of the way? Why do you think Oscar de la Hoya came clean and said that he was wearing women's underwear and those photos? Then it was a real, because every night that the fucking truth is knocking them on the head, Dude, you were in

Speaker 2:          00:40:47       checks, underwear. Just fucking say it. I can't,

Speaker 3:          00:40:50       he can take care of just tossing and sweating. If he ate a pot Brownie, he would have been forced to admit it like right away he just would have been two down strips you down, you know, and you, you, you, you have a strong mushroom trip, man. It just strips you down. You see what they describe as the wiring under the board. You know, you see things in a different perspective. It's, it's, it's an impossible perspective. It shouldn't be. First of all, it shouldn't exist and second of all, it shouldn't be so easy to get to. All you have to do is eat this stuff. You eat this stuff and wait an hour and 20 minutes and all of a sudden you're literally in an impossible describe different world that shouldn't exist. It can't be real because it violates everything you know about life. When you're closing your eyes, everywhere you look is more and more impossible.

Speaker 3:          00:41:35       And there's information coming at you all the answers to all the world's problems, but it's like slippery fish and you're standing in a river and you can't fucking hold on to many of it. There's just too many fucking fish coming your way, man. And there's the water and the information is hitting you like the fucking river. You're selling the game or some. Again, it's not for everybody, but it's for you. That's what I say. It's not for everybody, but it's for you. There's great men who have learned incredible things from psychedelic trips and there's a guy named Graham Hancock who was going to be doing the podcast soon. He contacted me in email. I just emailed him back and he says, genius writer who wrote these fascinating books about ancient human history called the fingerprints of the gods. It's a all about these ancient structures that point to uh, the v very plausible idea that the human race has been around way longer than we'd like to thank.

Speaker 3:          00:42:24       And that civilization has had peaks and valleys where we were almost wiped out and we had to rebuild a new and he claims that they're kinda like what you were talking about before, like returned to the cities and be like where are these buildings come? Sure. But when his case it was more of like, I think what he there they're mostly pointing towards giant cataclysmic disasters that have, you know, all but wiped out a huge percentage of the human race and then people have to start all over again. I mean the concept of what if today, okay, in 2011 like the Matrix third metrics movie was that it was that, was that what happened in the theater majors? They were like this is, you know, permutation of a fucking equation that it's essentially the message was this happened, there's the 16th time we've done this.

Speaker 3:          00:43:06       Like we keep running you guys and to turn to you guys is based yeah, that's based on an ancient Hindu system or it's an Indian system called the [inaudible]. That's I think, I don't know the full thing. Our friend Duncan's an expert in this shit. But what do you, the way he explained it to me is that this is Kali Yoga and the Kali Yoga is like the, the most chaotic stage of the human existence. And we have this normal natural progression from like, you know, sensible to wild, the crazy to completely out of control, which is where we are now. And to the next stage is some sort of an enlightenment, some sort of a learning from this, some sort of a, a next passage that goes through. And then the idea is that we're that humanities in this continuous cycle and that it's, you know, we like to think of ourselves, it hasn't having a direct linear projection from monkey to human being in 2011 but in fact it may have hit this peak thousands and thousands and thousands of years ago and then been shut down by some horrible disaster that killed almost everybody and that almost everybody forgets about it because you kill like half the fucking people and mandate, you know, w w good luck, good luck piecing things together, writing things down.

Speaker 3:          00:44:11       You know, paper gets d disappears. They burned the library of Alexandria, they all saw the records for Egypt. Everything they have left to just shit carved in snow or it carved in stone. Rather. It's like, you know, you want to really get the full history of the human race. It's really complicated. It's like we don't really know what happened 10,000 years ago. We don't really know what happened 15 20,000 and in the course of the universe or the course of the life of this planet, that's a fucking half of a blink of the eye. It's almost like as a race, we have woken up at a certain level where we started writing things down like we'll call it a thousand years ago, whatever the fuck it was, where people really started writing things down. It's almost like we're just slowly piecing this fucking thing together. As it's moving, it's moving into the reaction.

Speaker 3:          00:44:52       People just starting to write things down, okay, this is what happens in this and this and this. Then the next people come along and go, okay, they already figured this out. Okay, what else can we figure it out? Then we got to figure this out and they're all moving along as life is moving, constantly trying to Riyadh to this fucking pile of awakening. I try to describe this life that were just born in the middle of mid momentum, hit the ground running. As soon as you could walk your golf to school and you're a fucking cog in the wheel boom and, and you know, and very little time to sit down and think about what the fuck it really is.

Speaker 2:          00:45:21       The notion of a, it's all occurring. Like we're waking up the renaissance of sorts when somebody writing it down, number one, I thought that was really sweet, but number two, the notion of doing that while you're moving, like moving forward still, you can't stop time and tell people like, wait, let me catch up and write everything down. So far. Yeah. Like they, you'd have to start fucking swimming. You're absolutely right. That's kind of evocative. That was a really beautiful image. Well done. Thanks. Yeah, I'm a writer. I appreciate it. Some good words, but as well done. You took me right fucking there. You sold the game mean, but that is what, that is what we're doing, right? Yeah. We try to think, I don't know, boy, now you're making the move in one direction. The human. If you just look at the idea that we're constantly creating new things, constantly trying to improve on the technology, it's Kinda reached some fucking nuts

Speaker 3:          00:46:12       point sometime in the future when machines take over. Yeah, man, this Kurt's wheel Rickerts wields. He's one of those futurists that believes in it as a lot of other guys who have a very unroll the prediction. You know, there's a lot of people that, you know, think that we have been so desensitized by the Terminator being a movie, right? But we think it's silly that we don't recognize that this is a fucking real problem at skynet. Could be. And what do we, what are we thinking that we're going to create something that's going to have autonomy. We're going to create something that has a, you were gonna want to know if it can turn itself on. We're going to want to figure that out. We're going to want to know if we can make something like a repair itself. We're gonna want to know if we can make something that can clone itself, given enough time with human beings monkeying around with shit. We're eventually going to hit that point, man. You're talking about singularity? Yeah, it's an instant evitable it seems in our lifetime. It's a captivating, the

Speaker 2:          00:47:03       notion, I read the, I forget either time or Newsweek did a wonderful article on it, but the way they described it though, it was very evocative and as much as they said, think about how like the first computer, you know, fill a couple rooms and it's equating power wasn't even a 10th of what your phone can do right now. And that was going back to what, how years ago was that?

Speaker 1:          00:47:30       50 60 years ago. Yeah. So in that piece they said, imagine what's going to be in 30 years from now. From this moment. No, there's like this phone exist, the phone, the computer, the outs, outs with a piece. I mean Steve Jobs said it himself a couple of months back. He was like, when he was talking about doing the cloud, he's like, the hardware's not the, the sole anymore. It's just a conduit and whatnot.

Speaker 3:          00:47:55       It's not going to be ring tones. You know the future's going to be, you going to be able to talk to each other. I'm going to be able to go, dude, where are you?

Speaker 3:          00:48:01       And people are going to get upset if you don't let them do that. Like girls are going to get upset. Why can't I just talk to you whenever I want to talk to you? What? Like shining. Yeah, like you want this? You want no, you want the fucking cell phone. You want the ring? You want to ring so you can look at it and decide whether or not to answer but if someone can make the cell phone rang. I thought you were saying like in the future we won't need phones talking to it might not even have to be a phone. It might not. You're right. It might not even have to be a phone, but I think initially it's going to start out with ringtones. The first thing that's going to be the dams gonna break is instead of a ringtone. Why? Why can't they set it up so I can talk to you in the ringtone?

Speaker 3:          00:48:35       Hey Kevin, it's me. Joe, pick up the phone, dude, I, this is fucking super important. I hate to be bugging you, but pick up the phone. Almost like an answering Michigan prereqs. That's what you're hearing. When the phone rings, you're hearing your friend say, dude, pick up the fucking phone right now. Almost like old school answering machine. You know, that will be the first option. And people would get that because they'll say, honey, what if it's an emergency and this some shit goes down and I need to get in touch with you. Yeah, you're right. Okay. And then people go, what the fuck? Where are you bitch? I'm fucking calling you right now. I'm going to keep calling you every fucking dude and you'll, you'll be able to harass that person. Literally yell at them until they shut their fucking phone off. That that will be step one. And then eventually there will be no more phone. They're gonna figure out some way, whether it's a neural implants or you know, yeah, I think it's neural implants. Well, implying

Speaker 1:          00:49:18       30 years from now, the phone will be insertable into your head. This is a tiny, it'll be like this. And there's that material. What does it call this? The shit that's like as thin as Saran fiber optics. I don't know if that's it. This is new material. It's about thin as a, probably can't be that new fiber optics is old as fuck. That's it. And I don't think it's that I'm talking to myself. It's then like they showed a piece of, it looks like a piece of Saran wrap, but it's the strength of it is like fucking concrete, like 16 layers of concrete. And they're saying it also has fold ability so you can roll it up and bundle it up and it's also made of sand or whatever, you know, fucking silicon. So it's conductive. So they're saying, imagine you had or like this. Yeah, this looks Kinda so, I don't know what these are, but these ties, is that what it is? Um, I want to smell it. If you had this and you could do this with it or you could just roll it up real tight and stick it in your ear, this would be your phone. They're like, shape is no longer a problem. Like this is the material. It's like when you watched the fucking Batman begins,

Speaker 2:          00:50:28       he's got that memory cloth for the Cape or little electric charge to it in a titans. Same thing here. They only let, you don't need to tighten it. They're like, it's all flexible. Everything, all the conductors are inside. So it will do exactly what it needs to have that for a armor, for motorcycle riders. Now I know, I think they'll have some shit when you hit the ground. The impact of like flattens it out it hard. I, yeah, I don't know if that's in testing or if that's actually a good sale. I saw that video. But one of the things they've come out recently with and a know a lot of people say like, man, you guys always talk about the fucking soon. You already know. Tell her to hearing this. Like that's like number one complaint in the podcast. And I admit it because I fucking drone on about it.

Speaker 2:          00:51:04       Why? Because I a gang. Yeah. And when I see things like this, okay. Look, artificial skin made from spider silk. Yes. Bullet proof. Isn't that amazing, dude? I'm going to get bulletproof scan. It's going to be awesome. I can't wait until this is legal. I'm going to get a full bar. They're going to skin me. They're going to try to keep me alive by the skin. Me. And then they replace your skin with bulletproof. Spiders get silk skin. How crazy is it? How many people are going to sign up for that? You don't want to be an early adoptee. It's like fake lips. Read the ingredient. Wait until they get that shit down. You know, he didn't want to fucking big stitches under your armpits. Yeah, they live giant fuck and scars, Dude. I like my new skin. It's bulletproof and everything, but a fucking hate.

Speaker 2:          00:51:42       The scars read how they make it too. That's goat's milk. They put the enzyme or they weren't, you know, gee, they fucked with the genetics. The DNA, if you will. It's amazing, man of this weird goat's milk and made it like more like spiders. So whatever the Goco, you know, whatever they milk out of the goat. They spin into this fucking hardest substance there that help. I was stronger than Kevlar. Dope is nature. Yeah. This crazy little giant little fucking insect thing. This weird abdomen produces this shit. There was a line and then this great Batman, oh, it was a swamp thing. Issue that Batman was in years ago that Alan Moore wrote. We're swamp thing. You know, he's an elemental, he's, you know, get the power of nature on a side and whatnot. Big swamp thing. Fan back in the Disney. So, uh, he attacks Gotham.

Speaker 2:          00:52:28       They have his woman, they've tied up Abby Arcane, they've kept her in jail. They've arrested her because she's cohabitated with the vegetative. A humanoid. Really? Yeah, the swamp thing. And so they put her in jail. She was supposed to be arrested in Houma and they arrest restaurant, Gotham and stead and swamp thing is like, we want to release. And they were like, we can't, she's, you know, she committed a crime, she's going to be healthier on trial and whatnot. And swamp thing takes a slowly ticks over Gotham. He warns them, you know, he just appears from like can make himself, as you know, out of any vegetative material whatsoever. It turns into a giant head and it's just like release the woman or I will take the city, you know, and the end, the one issue with part one of like, you know, you see Gotham start falling into jungle. Like he just over vegetated everything and people just go back to fucking nature. He takes the, takes the city and turns it back into the jungle. In the last panel is a high view of all this of course. And standing on a Gargoyles, the one motherfucker who does not want anything to go back

Speaker 1:          00:53:26       to the jungle and it's Batman. Powerful fucking book. But at one point, second issue, swamp thing has this line where he goes to us like if nature but shrugged, you'd be all, you'd all be gone or something very powerful like that. But it's the if nature but shrug line that always got me cause he was talking about we think we command everything. We think we're, we've mastered shit we know are dumb. But it's just that you've talked about before a cataclysmic event that wipes out half the planet or something like that. That's if nature but shrugs. It happens out here. You know, when we feel the tremors, the earthquakes were reminded all the time that surface fleas as George Carlin described as, um, but when you see nature going crazy with the weather and whatnot, and you start sitting there going, oh, like, do you remember that George Carlin bit where he talked about how the planets find the people are fucked, him and his legendary bit. But you know, he starts theorizing on like the planet trying to pick us off with disease and shit like that. Um, and, and you start seeing every time I see a natural disaster, it's all I could think about it. I was just like the planets after us again,

Speaker 3:          00:54:29       they found the world's largest pyramid by volume in Guatemala, expectantly they founded a couple of years ago. It's enormous by volume, like a cigarette. Whereas the pyramid, it's like a Mayan pyramid. You know, the Mayan Pyramids, they weren't smooth like the Egyptian pyramids, but they all went into that same shape essentially. Well, they found it in Guatemala, covered in jungle. I mean, this is just a totally lost, amazing civilization covered in jungle. And they think there might be thousands of these thousands of these all throughout South America, thousands of lost temples and pyramids. This incredible civilization that existed that made these immense structures in a place that's so nuts that the, the jungle just overgrew everything to the point where they thought it was a mountain, they thought it was a mountain and they start excavating it and find out it's the biggest fucking pyramid by volume on earth when it does happen.

Speaker 3:          00:55:28       2009 apparently they had it on CNN. I was a, somebody just posted it recently and I tweeted it. It's a a, it says though, the thing on Youtube is world's largest pyramid discovered like they lost this whole thing. Man. People had moved out of there so much to the point where there was nothing living there. It was just trees and the whole thing just filled with grass and trees and someone had a come along thousands of years later and kick something over and go, what's this? Dig a little hole. Hey Man, this is a brick. Hey, bring over shovel and the next thing you know they're like, what the fuck is this? Slowly way up to imagine what that means. That experience must be like a finding something like that as well. We have a phenomenal, I mean, well, well it's the top

Speaker 1:          00:56:09       set of whatever Geraldo Rivera felt.

Speaker 3:          00:56:12       Oh Fund up Al Capone's vault and was like nothing. There's nothing in here. But the shock that this could be left behind. The shock for this is, you know, thousands of years ago, can't even really wrap our heads around that. They built this shit and it all went bad and the fucking jungle overtook the land. You know, you go Atlanta's to go as far back as Atlantis or no, do I believe in Atlanta? So there's some, some archeologists that believe they founded off of Spain. In fact, they have concentric rings that they've found in a satellite view of the ocean. They somehow or another that you know, they can, they can see like the topography of the ocean from space and in the satellite view they found this place that literally matches the geography, matches the area that it would be matches the local layer matches. You know, there's, there's, there's, there's folk layer that that is attached to it.

Speaker 3:          00:56:59       You know, that you could be attributed to history. You know, you can tell you the actual history. So they believe that they have found Atlantis. What Ha, what had happened to it. It just does. This place was a also very subject to tsunamis. It's had many tsunamis before and they think that's most likely what happened was that, you know, these people lived on a part of the sea, they had an advanced civilization. It got really prosperous, but they weren't aware yet of tsunamis and Chet along those lines, like if you go a few thousand years without a tsunami, it's not unheard of. It could mean can hope the world because what hasn't happened in a few thousand years that we're aware of and suddenly it's going to happen again. Well, especially on the west coast, man. I mean, we know that some big ones if hit I believe up in as far north as like Seattle and Portland, Oregon, uh, hundreds of years ago, that place got fucked up by tsunamis.

Speaker 3:          00:57:46       It's real possible. I mean, the ocean is gigantic and it's right there. But if, uh, if my point is that if a few hundred years go by and there's no tsunami, that's not unusual. So if this civilization was allowed to prosper and grow in a few hundred years, it could have been super advanced. We know that they could do a bunch of things back in, you know, 10,000 plus years ago that we didn't think they could do. And we're, we're more and more figuring out as time goes on, but they might have been way more advanced than we ever gave them credit for. They might've even have telescopes. Like there's, there's people that believe that they found lenses that they get attribute to be being ground down. And some say that they're not strong enough to, to, to, to actually work as a telescope. But it could have been, you know, one of many.

Speaker 3:          00:58:25       They could have evolved if they came up with this initial idea and you found a bad version of it. Just the fact that they had figured out that they can make something at a crystal and look through it, that's some pretty advanced shit. What are you looking for? What are you doing with that? Is you sure that's just ornamental? And were they making telescopes? Were they making microscopes? What the fuck were they doing? Were clearly says they're there, they're examining the unexamined life is not worth living. So there were philosophical people, they weren't, they were looking for answers. So it wasn't enough to just be like, feed me, feed me sex. It was enough to be like, I want to look beyond our world or deeper into our right and a totally different way. They did it from the way we did it, but we have this whole petrochemical way of viewing the world and we think that's the only way to do it.

Speaker 3:          00:59:08       And it may not be. They may be that there's some civilizations that have reached some staggering heights without the use of that and we just don't know how the fuck they did it. We need, and we don't know how. They moved a lot of the great stones to make giant structures throughout history. That's this great Graham Hancock, that's like his specialty on this thing and he, he wrote a book called supernatural all about his experiences with his IOWASCA. This drinking is brew and all his experiences with psychedelics and how empowering they've been to him and how he believes that it's very likely that they are the source of, of human, a human culture and human knowledge and human growth and it's shorter than social source of self awareness that it probably started with psychedelic experiences and it's an, he's not the only one to say this.

Speaker 3:          00:59:49       Mckenna believed it. As I said before, a lot of people echo it, but I just think, I think everyone who's creative, everyone who is an artist, everyone who is a thinker, you deserve to go through an experience with someone who knows what they're doing. That's why it should be legal and there should be shamans and there should be someone who runs a center that can evaluate whether or not, first of all, you're psychologically capable of handling such an experience, but give you the proper dosage, keep you supervision. It should be something that people encourage because it makes you a better person.

Speaker 1:          01:00:21       Mm. I'm back in the day that person existed, he was the medicine man or Shelman. Yeah, in the Amazon. Right now, the guys who make the ILS Osca well, well, I can't, well, I'm, you know, I guess there's no money in shamanism. Is that why there's two tricky, no, there's no money in it. If there was money, they put you in jail. If you started getting money for being a showman, they'll fucking lock you up. What are you doing? Shaman? What? What are you getting? We would have given these fucking people, lock them up. Chamonix check his house. Shammo I feel what? Uh, yeah, I guess you can't practice. Know what Madison even especially holistic medicine, they get weird. First of all, I guarantee you on Twitter tonight, you will be getting thousands of people telling you to do mushrooms. Yeah, no doubt that's going to happen. I'm telling you, you've got to look, I'm 41. You've gotten me a lot closer than anybody else. Like my wife, who I've been married to and fucking for 12, and respect to bond with your team. You aren't getting laid. Every problem. I told me years ago, she's like, you would really love mushrooms. I can't believe you've never done mushrooms. She's like, we should get mushrooms and do them together. One Desk. I don't think I could go. You're a very unusual thinker

Speaker 3:          01:01:23       and I think it would only aid in your thought process. It'd be fascinating. You're sold down to earth as it is. Dude. You're such a normal guy. Like, um, I don't know how you managed to navigate the entire system of, and you're in the movie system, which I think is even more ridiculous than my system. My system. I'm on the fringes. I'm in like fucking, you know, sports commentary and standup comedy. That's really what, and occasionally fear factor. That's my um, fringed you're deep

Speaker 1:          01:01:50       into the belly of bullshit, but it's amazing that you've been able to do that. It's amazing. Even embark with alias actors, you just have to give up ego and you'd have to be willing to accept less. You've got to manage your expectations. Something I learned by being in my wife all these years, this was a chick who didn't want to marry a fat guy, but she met one who she really liked. He is good and all other ways except for that one, she managed her expectations and it all worked out for you. You know what I'm saying? She's like, Oh God can, I can deal with that. But the rest of the package good. You manage your expectations and you can do that sort of thing. So for me, I always try to keep the ego in check, manage the expectations, expectations in this business or everyone should be paying attention to me.

Speaker 1:          01:02:31       I should be the epicenter of everything and I'm what's hot and blah, blah, blah. And I've always accepted the fact that that was never going to be me. So it was always content to just dwell out here on the fringes and when you're hired on the fringes that it's, I wouldn't say you're incorruptible, but it is, people aren't that interested in corrupting you and, and you can also watch the corruption go on deep in the center of the bullshit as you say. And so while you're kind of not above it but just outside of it, it's a lot easier to see it happening and stay away from it. When you see a movie like Conan, do you go, oh that must have been a mass to work on and now I, when I see it I was just the, I see, I mean I didn't see it, but if I saw a movie like Kona and I'd be like, Oh man, could you imagine how many people put in so much time into this?

Speaker 1:          01:03:15       And then it didn't take off like that's, I see the expense is all I see now is the money. I watch any movie and I'm just like, oh perfect. Conan too though could have done it. Should have done it. Why didn't that work? Did. I saw that trailer and I was just like, all right, I'm a huge fan of the Arnold Kona and that was my cone and I didn't even, I wasn't aware of they were making the Cornell movie until I saw the trailer. I was like, what the fuck? Why would anyone bother? And I watched it. I was like, Oh, you know what? This is a lot closer to the real Kona m and fucking Arnold Schwarzenegger.

Speaker 3:          01:03:43       It was very close. It just got stupid too many times. It just lost it went off the track and into the woods too many times was that dude as a character was great. He would've been an awesome Conan in the under the right direction with the right script. But I wrote a red rather a something that the guy who made it wrote and he talked about as original script and how it got butchered all the way. And that's make sense. Like when you see something so disjointed where so much, so many parts of it were awesome. Like the little kid in the beginning that was fucking bad ass. You didn't see him for the new Kona. Yeah. He didn't see the Newtonian yet save it. But if you do see it, this part is what I, a huge fan of the Old Komeito while I'm a robbery Howard fan man. So you go back deeper as, all right. So as a Howard Fan, did you see uh, what was that movie about him with Renee Zellweger and you know what, that's an offer. He bought that movie. I have it in the back of my fucking shelf, my DVD shelf, and I've never watched one of those world if I forget. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:04:35       But anyway, if as a fan, as a Howard fan, did you like the Arnold's Conan or did you feel like, is it like a reading the shining book versus the coopers shining?

Speaker 3:          01:04:46       It's like they cartoon to find it for sure. The CONAN was much more ruthless and brutal and bloody and it was way crazy. Like I say soft and Tim, you feel oh yeah. Both of them softened him. Yeah. I mean he was, he was, uh, you know, like it was a compassionate guy and he always did the right thing. But he was fucking hack and heads off left and right. I mean, it was just a mean. He was just a barbarian making its way through magic and sorcery and monsters and fucking hordes of ogres and I mean, they were just crazy ass fucking wild stories. Robert Howard was a bad motherfucker, but he was ultimately crazy and one of them blown in his own brains out. I think it was like 36 or something was a whole wide world. That's the name of the movie, I think the wholesale what it is.

Speaker 3:          01:05:27       Yeah. He killed himself. Yeah, yeah, yeah. He just was so into his fucking his, his world of fantasy. We so good at it, but his real life just sucked. Man is real life. He just was miserable. He hated it. And he made this character this with whatever pain that he was going through in his real life. He poured it into this character being powerful. You know, it's just dumb. He, they weren't just straight Scifi fantasy books. There were so consistent. Right. You know, they were, there was some great ones, man, I fucking loved him. You would buy him the paper bags with the Frank Frazetta fucking oil paintings on the cover of him. Holy Shit. You know, I mean those were books, man. That was some amazing shit that you read the comics as well. Yeah, I did. One of my saddest moments in my life is when I was so poor when I was a struggling comedian that I had to sell all my comic books, which was sold everything I sold my Spiderman is my Conan's, mostly marvel at marvel. And then I had a lot of like creepy and ear. He, you know, those uh, independent magazines. You make rent, just rent it for a month. Barely. I've probably got some food. I got 150 bucks for everything. And I mean, you're talking to years of collecting and the guy was totally screwed me, but I needed the money. It's probably hard to sell, man, you know? I mean, he's probably got to go through a lot. He needs to make some money off of it.

Speaker 1:          01:06:38       I've put together, we're trying to make clerks, I don't know. I was going to need money to make it. And I was a big comic book fan. I hadn't been collecting a hardcore for that long, was more all modern age stuff. I didn't go back and buy any golden or silver age, but still I did an evaluation in that collection man. It was like, I don't know, 20,000 and change or whatever, $20,000 with the comic books based on the book value book value. So I said, okay, I'm going to go into, yeah, of course over over maybe Overstreet I might've used on that point. Um, so I go, okay, this collection, then I'll sell it for 10 k. And so I go to a bunch of comp look a it shows and a bunch of comic book dealers and stores. And this is 1991, 92, let's say nine, no, 93 94 cause no 92 93 92.

Speaker 1:          01:07:27       And I give him my full catalog of everything I have with all the prices next to it, all the, you know, the guide prices and then the wrap up of 10,000 bucks like you know, and it's a collection that's worth more than that you can have for 10 k. Um, and nobody of course bit the only people that bit was um, this comic book store and in Middletown, which was called what? Holy Crap, I'm getting old and I can't remember, but in any event they took, they took my comics, they gave me $2,000 wait for it in store credit. Oh. So what I would do is sell my store credit to my friend Walt flat again. I'd be like, you go in comics plus that's what the name of the store, you go in Cox plus you buy $100 where the comics used my credit then give me 80 bucks cash.

Speaker 1:          01:08:19       So he was always getting like 20% off. So I wasn't even getting the fall two k. Wow. Yeah. Dang. But it made it paid for clerks. So there you go. Paid for a few bills that paid for clerks until Miramax pick clerks up. And then there was that. So, you know, I had never felt bad letting go to collection because it ultimately financed the thing that made everything else possible. And then years later, you know, I just figured like if I want the books, I go back and get them. And I collected the ones I did want again. But then years later I just bought a complex touring that was like buying a lot of comic book store. Yeah. I got one in Red Bank, New Jersey called Jane's Bob's secret stash. We have one out here in Westwood for a little while, but my friend got bored or running it and then we wound up shattering.

Speaker 1:          01:09:00       But the one back east has been open since like 97 that podcast. Tell Him Steve, David and my friends got the show of on AMC that uh, that they record that at that comp. How much better our comic books on weed. I've, I haven't really written, I haven't read one yet. I've written a bunch and there's so much more fun to ride on weed. So you haven't read any since you've been smoking weed? No, I've been in a real non audience mode for the last few years. I don't, I don't read as much as I used to. I don't watch TV as much as I did. Just create your own shit. I've been on a real creation Jag and you know it comes and goes. I think in cycles, the old long you stick around, the more he realized that like creatively fertile and like in the early part of my career and then I get into career management middle of the career and pay perhaps not as fertile.

Speaker 1:          01:09:51       The ideas aren't as cool. Maybe you start thinking more about like, well I got to eat, I got to make sure I got another job after this, but now I'm back into a creatively fertile period where it's just like I'm going to try this, let me try this and that. You get a certain amount of respectability, we can really do whatever you want. Yeah, I think so. That's what you hit. That's why I'm like, you're crazy to say that you're not famous, but I have, it's the name and I never thought of it as kid. Doesn't matter. It doesn't matter. It's all nonsense. But what's important is the, you're doing something very different though though. The whole way you're doing it, the way you're doing it with constantly being, putting out these podcasts mean you know, just doing a podcast like this. You realize like how much of who you are you put out there.

Speaker 1:          01:10:29       I mean you just, you putting it out there every day like that. It's about how bottomless we are in terms of like, if you can think about how many podcasts you've done a couple that with all this standup, you've done a couple that with every real conversation you ever shared with somebody in your fucking life and you're still not done, you still have so much more to say. We're, we're unfathomably deep human beings are deep creatures who can keep finding things to talk about. We talk because what else is there if we're not communicating with ourselves with each other, what are we doing here? Especially now with the Internet. I mean that's the big difference between now and 20 years ago world. That's why I say 20 years ago I'd be fucking freaking out that I didn't have the Internet cause the come, you can choose the community you choose to communicate the community that you interact with and I bet you find, even though you have a lot of fucking people and your Twitter, I bet you find they're predominantly cool, aren't they?

Speaker 1:          01:11:20       Yes. Across the board. So that's why I love Twitter because it's so positive. Everything. Your fans feel good. Yeah. You have 1,800,000 plus of your fans tuned into you. We could tell them things and you could clue them in on stuff all the time and they're excited and happy. It's all positive. They're predisposed to say something positive. All of course you get the random sniper jackass. But generally it's just like, oh my God, I just watched clerks and it was great. And you know, I've never seen it before or I had a real shitty day. Listen to the podcast feel great. Thanks. Are you know the today has been the last two days? Well, I mean last week, two weeks when with the Canadian tour, but the last day, like not even full day last 12 hours red state, but on VOD since I woke up this morning, which was about, I think I got up at four Ivr.

Speaker 1:          01:12:05       Ironically I wake up around four 20 every day. I got up around fourish and it started reading positive feedback is people can watch it on Vod, at their fucking house, on their computer because people are watching it, tweeting me while they're watching it and do it. It's like a, it's like a never ending series of great job patting you on the back. Like I said, I was saying before, it costs nothing to encourage an artist and the yield, the potential yield is, it is indescribable. Think about it. You, you encourage an artist one day they write that song that becomes that most important song in the world to you on that day that your parent fucking dies. The song that says it all, that you'll always be dialed into. They were that person maybe writes a blog that, oh, puts the shit you always wanted to say right into perspective and new meme it out to everybody.

Speaker 1:          01:12:53       It's your becomes your mantra. They make movie that you know is that movie that changed your life, whatever, man. There's all upside to encouraging an artist. Nothing good comes from the flip side, discouraging an artist. Now people be like, well, you should discourage some fucking artists like you wee bowl or some were Kevin Smith I or the ELA. Well, Shit. You know what I'm saying? There's nothing bad. Nothing good comes from that. You tell some of the are you stink, don't do it anymore. What are they gonna do? They stop and maybe they don't. Maybe you don't like them, but maybe they don't inspire somebody else or make somebody else think, hey, I can try it. You say that, but what about the concept of the salmon needing a waterfall to climb up to ensure that the strong gene survive and if every person had told you, Oh fuck Kevin Smith, those haters fueled you and gave you extra inspiration to push further.

Speaker 1:          01:13:39       Highlight that if these are like your work like that. No, I try not to. It's definitely a negative way to do it. I know a lot of fighters use that as motivation. I had think you have to in that lot of sliders, like they're his ears and also, but think about it as a fighter. You have to get over. I know you said that primal brain somewhere in there, but you got to get over the brain that we've been dealing with for so many years, which is like don't get hurt, don't go in there, don't, don't, don't run from danger protections. So, so right then and there, that's why it's so exciting differently than anybody else. They're going over their program like dove, right? They're rewiring

Speaker 2:          01:14:12       going in a different way and they have to try to stay zen in the moment and not freak out. And let it, the adrenaline and everything just overwhelmed them and go into full panic. We had Shandling, Garry Shandling was on the, on our, on our show it the house one day and he was talking, he likes to box a big box and he was talking about almost the same thing you were in terms of like you're there, they're not there it is. So it's about being there and letting go and it's an accounts out of you or he was describing a half, I forget how I described it in terms of like just not being where the punch is going to be and knowing that sooner or later you will get punched but the more you're in this moment like you eat once again, it's, so what I find fascinating about as people who can find or people getting a ring physical and not just like, oh we play some pickup basketball ship, but usually people get into boxing fighting.

Speaker 2:          01:15:04       They can be so poetic about it cause you are channeling into something I guess that most people don't. We don't live in a world where we'd go around fighting people or getting into physical altercations involving our body. So I think you guys do dial into something because everyone he is, when you describe it for just a second, I go like, yeah man, I should fucking fight. But I know I am not that guy. Like in a minute I get in the ring and be fucking taking, you know, the thought of getting hit would make me queasy and I pass out. But fighters, people that do it, people you know who've who've actually been in a ring and and and fought or continue to do it or so poetic about it that they can almost sell you on it to the point of like, wow, I should give that a shot, but I know I'm not made for being hit I one head and I'm gone.

Speaker 2:          01:15:51       It's not for everybody and nothing's forever. Right. But what it really sounds like you want, you want it to be for you because you listen to and go like, oh my God. Like, could you imagine being zen with about fighting about being there and not being there in that ring about having to, having to zone out, but be very present so as not to get fucking killed? Yeah, by choice and you have to learn how to harness all of your potential, everything together, psychological, physical. You got to tune it all together. You've got to make sure that your mind doesn't overwhelm your body with information. You've got to make sure that you keep your heart rate steady and stay calm and see things exactly as they are. Not exaggerated because you're under some adrenaline, heightened fear. You've got to keep it together, man, but what it really is is a vehicle for developing your human potential martial arts or something.

Speaker 2:          01:16:39       Anything that's really difficult, man. I think anything that's really, really, really fucking hard to do in doing so, you learn a lot about yourself while you're doing it and you learn about your potential. You learn what you could push yourself through. You learn how much focus you have in you. You learn how to project it, how to keep it strong, had to keep it going, had to stay, you know, stay heightened, stay in a heightened state. And that's what you, you get from that you learned excellence, you know, for anything. Whether it's martial arts are fucking playing a violin or anything when Shit's really difficult to do. You, you learn something about yourself in it. Mastery of it leads to mastery by the things in your master's. What was the quote you said? Once you understand the way broadly you can see it in all things beautiful and especially from a bad motherfucker chopping people up with a sword.

Speaker 2:          01:17:21       Yeah. I mean normally you get kind of that, that homespun wisdom from you know, a little bald man who sits, who's Chubby, who sits on a hill. But this dude's like, no, I, I know a lot about life cause I ended so fucking many of so sweetly slice of a razor like sword across the knack and wants the head separate from the body and like a fall down lovers kiss is body twitches before it falls in a couple of spurts of blood come out of the blow hole at the top and then it crumbles. Couple UNC, you're a, you're making things awkward. That's it. That's the end of the podcast folks. This is the longest podcast in the history of podcasts. How long we going you really get through all four hours if you really get through it all ladies and gentlemen, God bless you.

Speaker 2:          01:18:02       You're beautiful iTunes, we're probably going to have to chop this up into part one and part two is going to take a walk because I get that big of a fan. I don't want anybody her while we do the show monitor. Like in terms of can you read feedback? Do you have like we did that before but it was always nigger cunt, nigger con, uh, lesser. Whilst a lot of people just trying to buy Twitter I use Twitter is awesome. Yeah, like Twitter, I'll, I'll monitor while we do the show. When there's a chat and you want people like, people want to like send you something that you'll read. They'll just say the most obscene, ridiculous, retarded shit. So there was like a lot of people doing that flooding things. I was wondering if anyone, here we go, just listen to Kevin Smith and Joe Rogan mindblowing podcast. That's it. Can I get my old song back man? No Dude, you gotta go with the, with the eight bit versions. No Way. The committee version, man, I want to make a version of the last four minutes of free bird. Can we do that? Can we make that my new interviewee? I just want the last four minutes. Just the last four. Yeah. A free bird. Freebird Leonard's Kennard. Hmm. You know that, that

Speaker 4:          01:19:03       [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          01:19:07       and you know where the end comes. I don't even have it on this. Ladies and gentlemen, it's been an amazing podcast. I've had a great time. If you're still alive out there, if you're awake, if you haven't listened to us and driven your fucking car off the road and into the woods because we draw dotted on for four hours. I'm sorry I had anybody out there. Anybody at all remember that fucking day after. Yeah, and I was a kid. They did this, this TV movie about nuclear work as we were all afraid about dying nuclear war. Stop, drop and roll. Yes. But they made this movie called the day after on ABC and they were like, viewer discretion is advised. Like when that deep voice guy came into play first and they were telling you, it was like, this is intense. This is no joke. This is what could happen if America witnesses or feel, you know, get, feels the effects of a nuclear attack. And they at one point there, you know on the microphone go, I'm like, uh, this is blah, blah blah, wherever we are, Idaho's anybody out there. And then, you know, they wait for a response. They'll fucking, this

Speaker 1:          01:20:08       is Katie k, blah, blah blah. And Idaho. Is anybody out there? Anybody at all? Oh, it was so haunting as a kid. I was like, could you imagine there's only one to like 12 people left in this fucking town and they're trying to reach other people in the world. Name enough. Anybody's fucking left cause they saw mushroom clouds and shit. I terrified me as a kid, but when you were just like, if anybody's listening and reminded me of that, like is anybody out there? I think it was John Lithgow who said it to you pulled me back to lift gas circuit and to bitch. That's how class you are so kind of performer. You are. That's amazing folks. This has been an awesome time. I had his grants. I'm honored. Thanks. I'm really honored to be your friend. It's cool. It's fun. Likewise. Let's do it again anytime you want to do.

Speaker 1:          01:20:49       I said, I said, but you're busy. There's way too and you are. You've got a thousand things going on, but I said last time you want, when we were in my thing, I said, I want to do a podcast every week with Rogan, just called centered where we just get stoned and they go. That's called the Joe Rogan experience. That's what they do. I was like, oh, I didn't know where we could combine our forces dude and I was going to help you. We'd legalize and half this country I know may look like we're sure poster children for stoners work. We're productive. We're well at, you know, were well spoken. I'm about will edge and nice, well spoken and yeah, we're nice people. That's got it going on though too because you're got the strength to, well that's the confusing. Protect us. Yes we need, yeah. We're like, look, he's smart, but look at those guns were okay behind him. I flipped the switch. It's confusing. I'm confusing people.

Speaker 1:          01:22:21       that show. And they were like, you know, don't pay pay as you exit. And they were all worried. Like, I think spanky was a god of your mind. They're never going to pay the of the show. As bad as the show was. They all

And uh, I have some dates coming up but I can't read my Twitter page. What is it? We got a Washington DC September 30th tickets just went on sale today. There was a of sale yesterday. The Warner theater that's good. Synagogue said goes a nice place.

Speaker 2:          01:23:06       I like it. Awesome. Yeah, this is the sixth street synagogue, I think it is. Oh yeah, it's literally a synagogue. It's about 600 seater. Um, I did a show there, a Q and a, I think last time was in DC. It was, it was cool. We didn't, that's not what we played red state. We played red state, I believe at the, at the Warner, but we played, I did a Q and a at the synagogue is nice place. Not you know, 600 seats but it's pretty cool. Nice. Cool. And then a Houston Texas goes on sale Tuesday salt at all. You guys go where you going there? The Verizon Wireless Center Centre motherfucker I'm going to, is that bitch? I Dunno. It's a couple thousand. Oh fuck bro. Look at this guy pulling out his fucking performance. What? I'm just kind of balling now. What um, uh, I, I, you know, I actually, you should tell you that I started doing Q and A's at the end of my show is one of the reasons cause I saw you doing and I thought it looked cool as fuck on isn't the ability just to let people just walk up to you and ask questions.

Speaker 2:          01:23:57       You know who I saw do it,

Speaker 1:          01:23:59       stayed with me, my entire youth, my grandmothers to watch Carol Burnett show. And at the end of the show she'd stand out there and do Q and A. Carol Burnett would do that at the end of her show sketch show. She did. I have not every episode, but like, and you, when she did it, it was fun because like, she was literally like, no masks, no disguise is no costumes. She's literally came out on stage. I'm sitting there talking to the audience and you know, she'd tug her rear, say goodbye to her grandmother, whatever that meant. But it was, I dunno, it was just informal casual and she seemed so fucking quick. Like she always had a great answer and stuff. And Shandling was on the show when Garry Shandling was on our show a couple of weeks ago, he said that he was talking to Carol Burnett about, uh, about that show. And she said, she goes, um, to, you know, do you know how that worked? We only used the funny questions.

Speaker 2:          01:24:46       She whispered it to him like it was a fucking leg of great recipe or something. It was like, oh, that's hilarious. But I liked, I always liked it as a kid. Like, that was my favorite part of that show was like, oh my gosh, she's going to literally talk to the audience, fill harm you to do that after every a taping of Newsradio did he really? Yeah, he would Q and a with the audience and do it all the time. He would ask next time we do this and we just got talking about farmers could even do stand up. He would go out and do impressions cause he had a crazy Clinton impression, you know, uh, you know, uh, I don't have a small pain is Monica Lewinsky has a big mouth, a bunch of, uh, like Clinton's should fill as Clinton. Thank you rob. And he, he, uh, he would go and do Q and a with the audience when he was very sharp and very quick.

Speaker 2:          01:25:27       And I, I actually started, I never, for the first time with the first season, I never talked to the audience very much. I would say hi and whatever, but I never would do like stand up for him. Then after he started doing it, I was like, yeah, we could just fucking fuck around and talk to the audience. So Andy would go up and do it and I would do it and yeah, it was, it was, it was a good time. Just cause like a captive audience. Be predisposed to like you. Yeah. See why you're trained pros, that's what you do. And they like it. It's fun for them. You know? It's like all of a sudden this, we've gone off the, uh, the normal pattern of what's going to happen here tonight and they're just having a good time. And yes, fucking around. Dude. You're the shit. Thank you very much. But I do this all the time. This is a new

Speaker 3:          01:26:04       empire. We're building together or something, but I ever blah, blah blah, brick by brick weed. This is the end of this podcast. Thank you very much for getting here. And we'll see you soon. Sunday with Patton Oswald. Ladies and gentlemen, we love you bitches.
