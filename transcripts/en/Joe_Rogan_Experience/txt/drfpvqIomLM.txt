Speaker 1:          00:00:01       Yes, it's true that the new Joe Rogan experience studio will have a desk that has meow written into it in metal. Damn. That's how we roll bitches real deep and we hire craftsman having shit constructed right now. Made out of old re a reused farm. Would the Joe Rogan experience podcast is brought to you by many, many things, ladies and gentlemen, because the shit all costs money and I'm trying to get paid. You know what I'm saying? One of the things were brought by is a fucking bad ass new cell phone company called Ting. Ting is it's. They use the sprint network so it's not like they have three towers in the whole country now. They have a fucking major network. They use a sprint network and they make shit really simple. They cut out all the bs that is normally involved in having a cell phone.

Speaker 1:          00:00:59       Like for instance, you don't have to have a contract, you don't have to pay if you cancel, like there's weird shit that happens when you get a cell phone. It's weird. It's not like buying gas. You can't say, well, you, I don't want to use your gas anymore so I'm not going to give you any more money. No, you, you somehow or another got roped into some weird thing where you've got to continue to give them money and if you don't want to give them money anymore, you've got to give them extra money. Three hundred and $50. He usually kind of bullshit is that. That's nonsense. That should be illegal and what team does is they take it upon themselves to try to create a moral business, a business that that's fair. A business that makes sense. No contracts, no bundling and ride along services, no overage charge.

Speaker 1:          00:01:42       If you use a certain amount of cell phone minutes per month and you don't use like all of your minutes, they roll over into the next month the way it should be. Rogan.ting.com. That's where you want to go and you'll save 50 bucks off of any smartphone and they have some dope phones, especially the one that I got from them is the Samsung Galaxy s three and it is fucking bad ass. I love it. Especially for looking at pictures and looking at websites. It's enormous, man. The screen is gorgeous. Is it better than the iphone? It's not better. It's different. It's bigger screen. It's a bigger screen. I know that, that part's better for sure. But um, I really am so used to the apple operating system that it will be hard for me to say what's better and what's worse. And by the way, I kept a blackberry for a long time.

Speaker 1:          00:02:31       I hung in there, dude. I took body shop. I saw people. I saw Mike Young last night using a blackberry, probably reminding himself of the old jokes that he's got written out. It's blackberry. This, uh, sorry my tongue. I hate to do that to you. And Mike Young, you know, I love them. Sort of. I do love him. He's a great guy. He's a great human being. I just give him. I give everybody shit about their act. You know, if you're, if you're telling the same jokes for 10 years, someone should give you shit and you should snap out of it. I think that's for all of us. Can you think Duncan? Yes, but other than that my comes and awesome dude. He's very funny too. Very funny person. What are you doing with that noise? Getting crazy. I like what you're doing with tripping you out. You aren't tripping me out. I like that. Setting the stage. Um, so go to [inaudible] dot [inaudible] dot com and find out more. Find out the technical shit that I can't tell you and see all the different phones that are available. Lots of different android phones are available and even like regular phones leave if you're, if you're crazy, you're one of those nutty dudes likes one of those flip Dana White's one of those many dudes. He's got like flip phone. It's got a little flip phone.

Speaker 2:          00:03:35       That's how they all had them in Japan. Remember in Japan they all had high tech flipped. Totally different though, but still teaching as you say, it's creating a situation where you don't have to have a contract and they have cheap phones. They have great. That's called prank central. I can just pop in there and get a phone for a month and then put that in my friend's trunk or in a briefcase. So they think they found some government phone and then randomly call them fuckers. Fuck yes.

Speaker 1:          00:04:02       Who the fuck is wrong with you? Why would you think to use it like that? Especially in the middle of a fucking commercial

Speaker 2:          00:04:07       that that helps sell the phones to cont was what's wrong with praying?

Speaker 1:          00:04:12       Thank you for landing. Now. That's really fake. Anyway, back to the commercial. Go to [inaudible] dot ting.com and check out all that shit. We're also brought to you by death squad dot TV, [inaudible] dot TV. [inaudible] DOT TV is to the website of Brian Red band. Uh, he was, uh, the first one to, to put a website up that represents what desk squad is, is our little family of fuckheads. That's us. We're the desk squad. Long story anyway. It's, um, if you go to [inaudible] dot tv, you can buy a desk, want tee shirt and we see them at so many of these, uh, these shows that we do and uh, it's, it's bad ass to say, you know, so many people wearing these silly fucking shirts. I'm a go to [inaudible] dot TV and you can pick them up is also stickers for sale and news of all upcoming tour dates. A lot of guys are starting to do a little mini road trips. I know Brian's got one coming up in Columbus, Ohio with. Yeah, with Brendan Walsh and Tony Hinchcliffe and a special guest. So I can't tell you about who's pretty fucking bad ass. So I'm going to Vancouver to not you bitch. It's not all about you

Speaker 2:          00:05:19       motherfucker. It's not all about him. I'm in the middle of a commercial for Brian. You like, I'm going somewhere to Vancouver to you, man. Just calm down. I didn't get the program. No, you should be happy though. Somebody's got another desk squad tattooed. This makes it, I think the 15th one and check this out. It's the new cat. The one that you like so much. Oh Wow. That's good. That's a really good version of that is fucking creepy as shit isn't it? And I can't even tell what part of his body because it looks like it's very big. It's clearly as. It's weird. I'm not a hardcore. Porn is going on there. You've got a lot of porcelain. Nice.

Speaker 1:          00:05:58       Eat some vegetables. I don't know what's happening. We're also brought to you by [inaudible] dot com. That's o n n I t and [inaudible] Dot com is a essentially a supplement company all for high end athletics. Supplements and what we call nootropics and what nootropics are is

Speaker 3:          00:06:16       far more complicated for a retard like myself to be describing and would really seem hypocritical if I had some Alpha brain with my beer. Is it not good with beer? I don't think. Does it really freaked me out? No, I don't think it goes with beer. Brian Duncan, excuse me. No, I don't think it's a nutritional and alcohol. It's like the opposite of nutritional. Alright dude. Silly Bitch.

Speaker 1:          00:06:45       If you go to [inaudible] dot com, o n n I, t you can check out all the different supplements that are available. Um, all of them are things that I have used extensively before we ever got involved in the company. It's all stuff that I believe in. Anything that I ever sell you on this silly fucking show. One thing I can guarantee you, if I say something, even if I'm incorrect, I believe it. Um, I'll never tell you anything I don't believe. And if I find out that I'm wrong, I'll tell you that. And if I use something and I tell you to use something, it's because it's a really solid product period. That goes all the way back to the fleshlight. Ladies and gentlemen, very underrated product. Flashlight, right Brian, just because I encouraged you, play a little piano in the background doesn't mean you can have fucking aliens landing on my head.

Speaker 1:          00:07:31       You're freaking me out, man. The newest things we have at a on it, our hemp force, which is this new delicious protein powder, it's the best tasting protein powder in the world. It's fucking fantastic. It's made out of hemp, which is hard to get an illegal in this country. Duncan trussell illegal. I know they've. Even though it doesn't even get you high, that's a good answer to the question that inevitably comes to these poor folks that have to get drug tested at work. No, we don't. None of them. Like if you. If you eat hemp protein powder, you will not test positive for thc, but if you eat poppy seed bagels, you will test positive for heroin, so you've got to be careful about that, which is really crazy. But it is true. They tell you not to eat poppy seed bagels before you go in for a drug test.

Speaker 1:          00:08:11       Does that mean that you could take enough poppy seed bagels and extract heroin out of them? I do not know. I don't think so. I think it's just a confusion in your system because I think the urine test that they use just register metabolites and it's just the same metabolite. Apparently. I got it. I don't really understand it. I don't think so. I don't think you can get high from it. I don't think you could just eat all day. I can't imagine if that's why the appeal of bagels at poppy seeds. We're just super mild heroin, you know, and you just eat it in the morning and just feel everything feels so good. How poppy seeds don't digest full laser. Like when you're wiping emily's little seeds flying all over your hands. Yeah, they're kind of tricky. Well, people had been arrested for having those seeds on them when they go to a like the Middle East and like really

Speaker 4:          00:08:55       strict drug countries because their seeds of like set off alarms and those fucking eight. Remember those things that they use for a little while that would push dust off of you that they don't use those anymore. I just stopped using those because dudes are going to jail for fucking poppy seeds and other countries. Fuck, that's just my ex opposition anyway. Have hemp force will not make you test positive. It's just the plant and it is a. it's a. it's not psychoactive at all. Even though it's completely, completely illegal. Yet legal. It's really weird. It's totally legal to have. It's totally legal to sell, but you can't grow it here. You have to grow somewhere else. It's really a fucking. It's, it's, it's clear corruption and it's clearly the pharmaceutical drug companies controlling agriculture and controlling our access to one of the greatest plants the world has ever known for whatever fucking goofy ass reason our government has let this go and place and even though they know that this hemp plant, even though it's related to marijuana, it has no psychoactive properties.

Speaker 4:          00:09:56       You cannot get high from it, but it has an amazing source of protein, amazing source of amino acids. You can make essential oil out of it. You can make fuel out of it. You can build houses with it. It's really unbelievable. That hampers illegal, but it is so we have to buy it from Canada, but it's legal to have it. Once you get it, once you fucking let somebody else grow it, it's so crazy. It's just one more giant piece of evidence that we're fucked. But if you go to [inaudible] dot com, that's o n n I t, you can get yourself some hemp force. It's Yummy. It's not. It doesn't have, it's got one gram of sugar per serving, one I think. Yeah, something. Whatever small amount is, and it's all Stevia that it's sweetened with, so it's sweetened with natural sweeteners and it's Yummy is fuck and it's got Makkah and it's also got a raw cocoa in it. So go to [inaudible]. Com comments o n n I t. all right, you fucking get some battle ropes in your system. We've got kettle bells, battle ropes, do a lot of manly shit. Duncan Trussell, and if you use a code name Brogan, you will save 10 percent off any an all supplements. All right, freaks. Duncan trussell's here. Let's get the party role.

Speaker 5:          00:11:06       Yeah,

Speaker 4:          00:11:08       the Joe Rogan experience.

Speaker 5:          00:11:10       Try my day. Joe Rogan podcast by night. All Day.

Speaker 4:          00:11:16       Powerful contrast. A lot of times you know someone, you can know someone for a long time and you go, wow, this fucking weird cat, man. I ain't never met anybody like him and you never get it. You're like, what is this dude is not like anybody ever. I wonder how this guy grew up and then you go to the town where they grew up and you go, oh, okay, okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. I just got a huge piece of the Duncan trussell puzzle this weekend in Asheville, North Carolina. Asheville is so awesome. I don't want to tell people about Asheville because I'm scared they're going to move there. I know. I'm scared. They'll move there and fucked up place up. It's crazy. I mean it's grown so fast, already mad because it's. It's unbelievably beautiful. It's, it's the whole thing is so ridiculous. You've got this incredibly gorgeous landscape all around you everywhere. These intense green mountains and then there's a super cool people in this town where you can walk around everywhere and you're like, whoa. I mean, it's like, it's like they took the best parts of Austin and moved into the North Carolina. Right. That's a perfect description. It's like southern cool people, but it's like freebasing Austin, if that's possible. It's really Canadian mining it. Austin. It's Austin in an inner needle. Shoved right into your Dick, but you didn't get to walk around

Speaker 6:          00:12:38       new shops I went to. There's a tea room there were like, like there's opium den with

Speaker 4:          00:12:46       blankets everywhere. People wear their shoes. Offsetting like reading poetry and it's fucking cool places. So weird. It's weird. It's awesome though. It was awesome. The show was awesome. Hanging out with the people there. It was awesome. Thanks to my friend Sam for hooking me up, taking care of us out there. It was a that the whole place was just so strange. It's like what a crazy little town. It's so small. It's so small and cool and like everything. I. I just loved everything about it. It's like occupy Wall Street turned into a city now. It's not because it's not as complaining.

Speaker 6:          00:13:28       That's true, but it is filled with. I mean it is filled with subversive folks. It's, there's a lot. There's a lot of people there who are apparently in the Environmental Liberation Front. Ecoterrorists perhaps are hanging out there. Oh my God. You should probably not say that on the air. Doing the government's work. I think people. Oh yeah. It'd be really hard to figure out. There might be ecoterrorists there. I saw none writing down the fucking street on some giant tricycle

Speaker 4:          00:13:55       cases on the phone. That wasn't a nun. That was a chick who's going to go fuck her boyfriend and he wanted her to come over dress like a nun. That's what that was. That's a gross. Yeah. That's a great girlfriend. That's. That was. It wasn't at my house on a tricycle dressed as a nun. I'm Horny, but there were a few churches there, so maybe it is, you know, I think religion that is. I've never been to the one place that has no religion, like even a boulder. Boulder's pretty, pretty liberal, intelligent, you know, sort of a left wing. He kind of a place that had plenty of churches.

Speaker 6:          00:14:23       My friend has sent me this thing. I haven't listened to it yet on this debate that they did as to whether or not the world would be a better place if religion did not exist and it's like a. like these are professional debaters and intellectuals. I can't remember what it's like on NPR or something, but the end result was they decided to have the world's better without religion

Speaker 4:          00:14:42       that they say that, but yes and no. I think religion serves as an operating system for a lot of people and if

Speaker 7:          00:14:52       they didn't have religion you'd have to explain shit to them and that could get so tiresome. They will get so tiresome to sit around with some blundering Moron pontificating on what it means to have a finite life in an infinite universe. And what, what part of you know, this part of this experience you really do play, what part do you play and what, what is your consciousness all about and why you so scared of it shutting off. Know those are scary, terrifying questions for the average person and you know, maybe like, you know, maybe some ditch digger do doesn't need to know that. Maybe there's some dudes who have some. I believe there's people that have brains that work way better than mine. I've seen it. I've talked to people that it's not just a matter of education. It's a matter of some people are gifted, you know, there's some people have a little tiny hands and then there's people that are built like Shaquille o'neal and he could grab them and crush them and it's not fair.

Speaker 7:          00:15:45       It doesn't make any sense, but it's just the way it is. And I think that there's some people that are, they're living in this life as humans, but yet they're not quite human to like just below human, like you talked to them and you're like, um. So, uh, so what do you think happens when you die? Well, man, for sure you go to heaven and you get to be with Jesus. Well, I've believed this and I was a child and you're talking to them and you know, there's like a weird disconnect with the person. Like they, they talk and it's not, not even that they're there, they're not just like this. I've met some really intelligent Christians. Don't get me wrong. It's not what I'm saying. What I'm saying is there's certain people that are just really dumb and they really aren't capable of thinking about deep shit.

Speaker 7:          00:16:30       They're not capable of pondering the really insane question of what the fuck this life is. They're not capable of it. So religion I've always felt was like a nice scaffolding for people like that. It lets them experience all the benefits of, of, of being a positive person and being a giving and loving person. You know, we all experience those benefits, you know, it's just, they're, they're teaching them to do it in the, the, the, the way that it's, it's transcribing the wishes of some holy master who created you and I said it once. I'm not fucking saying it again. Write it down. This is what you do, do it or else you go to hell. It's like, it's almost like it's structured to make the idiots like have a really simple moral path. Like it gives you a nice little story to explain the really weird but real complexities of love and positive thinking and, and how it shapes lives and how your intention shapes lives in your imagination, shapes your life and how this thing is malleable and it's, it's not understood.

Speaker 7:          00:17:42       This life that we're living simply not understood. That's too fucking weird for some people, they're not gonna they can handle that, that's not getting in there, that that's going to their ear and bouncing off like it hit a fucking trampoline. So for some people, religion allows them to be on a good path. It allows them to, you know, to do good and to experience the result of that even though they're doing it because of some fictional character, it's like they're still doing the same. They're doing the correct things. So like when religion gets nutty when you get into like the inquisition or stabbing cartoon makers because they drew your guy. When religion goes completely off the tracks like that, that's when it becomes a problem. But I think that's not the majority of religious people. I think the majority of religious people probably benefit from it in a sense of community for sure.

Speaker 7:          00:18:40       You know, churches are a big part of neighborhoods and communities, you know, it's a big part of how people interact with each other. And if you could find something that was, uh, a religion where, you know, it made sense to you, if it, if it was a logical religion, it actually would probably be a good thing to be a part of because you're, what you're doing is you're committing your family and you're committing all the families around you that are all in the sort of community together to take part in some sort of journey of spiritual Islam.

Speaker 6:          00:19:09       Can I play devil's advocate literally? Sure. Against religion. So, um, because I agree with you, but I think that the problem is that it creates a not only a structure where people can sort of rest and have an ethical system that they're not going to come up with on their own. But obviously the danger of all that is that certain unscrupulous human beings have figured out that if they put on the right costume, they can convince dopes to give them cows suck their day, take gold. Because all they have to say is. And they're like, God, they're the priests. And religious leaders become like gods agents, like ca for God, where they're like, yes, I'm taking the cause for God. I'll tell you what God wants and it wants you to blow me. Conveniently in, I don't know why, because he's crazy, but he wants you to suck my dick and he wants seven of your cows. I don't even know why likes cow

Speaker 7:          00:20:09       and he would like 10 percent of everything you make for the rest of your life. That's what he said. I just don't kill the Messenger. That's what he said. We're not going to put it on paper. I just want you to continue to pay that. Yeah, just that's not even on paper, right? When you tithe, it's not like written somewhere or you have to give 10 percent of your money. Right? Isn't that some people just do.

Speaker 6:          00:20:27       I don't know if there's a scriptural thing that says 10 percent. I think it's something that just sort of seems like a logical number, but I remember that it was a couple of years ago in India and in a temple, they like opened up at the faults in the temple. They hadn't opened it up or they found some vaults and it was just filled with gold, just filled with fucking gold and you know, everyone around the temple was in offer all this money. But when you really think about what that goal came from, it came from hypnotized people who believed that these priests were in some way representing God. And then the gold didn't even go anywhere. It molded in the basement of a fucking temple. Wow. So it's so when, when you see that there's that level of exploitation that happens in like you, you retweeted that amazing youtube video of the guy whose job it is to suck the freshly circumcised kids cock.

Speaker 1:          00:21:22       And he's explaining why according to religion, that's in my. That's the guy in my act. People think that that's fake. That's the really is real.

Speaker 6:          00:21:30       I couldn't believe it do. I did think you were exaggerating. I couldn't believe that that's a, uh, an actual.

Speaker 1:          00:21:35       Yeah. Well, it's not only that he was justifying it. He was justifying it by quoting the pages. It says in page 64 chapters. He's going through all this nonsense with his fucking wizard outfit on his goofy ass beard and he's explaining where it says it's okay to suck that baby's Davies. He's so. He's so completely lost his objectivity that he, he is actually trying to explain why this is necessary. I think there's a distinction to make between that deck, that baby deck. It's not just a baby's deck, it's a bleeding, babysit a screaming babies there can, you know, like I say in the bit about it that I do in my act, like how the fuck do we know that that kid can't remember that we're just assuming just because he can't talk and he, you know, that he doesn't have a way to express how much it sucks that you cut his dick and start sucking on it.

Speaker 1:          00:22:28       But for sure you don't know whether or not that baby can remember that. That seems like a really traumatic moment and I remember some intensely traumatic moments from when I was young. So I would think that would be something that would fucking haunt the back of your brain for the rest of your life. Some old creepy asshole speaking in a dead language and sucking your Dick while he's wearing a wizard costume. Bloody Day. Your Dick that he just mutilated slash Dick. While your parents don't even save you, your parents let this stupid. Yeah, they're paying dues to get this dummy to fucking cut your bloody duck. Suck it.

Speaker 6:          00:23:01       I just had my mom on my podcast and I was like, what did. How did it go when I came out of your pussy? Did they circumcise me? Right? Then they cut it off then and she's like, yeah. She said it was sometime around there. She's like, she's like, but you didn't like it. You cried.

Speaker 1:          00:23:15       Jesus Christ. No Shit. I cried. You snipped off the tip of my car. It's so crazy. It's everybody's mutilated. You know? The majority of Americans are mutilated and it's a weird thing with people where they don't want to admit that this is like, it's really kind of people. You're so exaggerating. Rogan. Fucking relax. Mutilating. That's a really what it is. It's like skin is there to protect the tip of your Dick. Don't you think uncircumcised macaques and porn look weird knowing don't Duncan the skin is

Speaker 7:          00:23:45       supposed to protect the tip of your Dick and your Dick is supposed to be like glistening mucusy. It's supposed to be like super sensitive, but instead they hacked that shit off and the tip of your Dick Dries out. It's not supposed to be dry like that. It's supposed to be moist like inside a woman's vagina. That's what your Dick supposed to be like and it's supposed to feel better that way because of that, because if it's moist and slippery and then there's this nonsense that people are pushing and it's all been disproven by science about aids. People are saying that it's like to protect people from aids. Like that is one of the craziest ideas I have ever fucking heard. Is that somehow or another extra for skin? Dick skin is gonna protect you. If you fuck a guy got aids. Like that is one of the craziest ideas I've ever heard. Like you're going gonna fuck that guy man. He's got aids. Like dude, I'm circumcised. Oh well go, go fuck away. Go hit it buddy. Like this. Not Protecting you from AIDS, there's no fucking way that protects you from aids. That's ridiculous, but we we can justify doing it. We want to justify that it was done to us and we were in denial about it. You're, you're hacking off a piece of a little kid's Dick and there's no science for it whatsoever. It's craziness and the majority of people do it.

Speaker 4:          00:25:00       How many pounds of baby for skin meet? It's generated a year enough to feed like a couple dogs for life, right? Couple bears. Thinking about all the babies being born and just chop, chop, chop, screaming. If you could put together all the babies being born, coming out of pussies all at once and getting their dicks circumcised altogether and one screaming man. It'd be a V, a dubstep music video.

Speaker 8:          00:25:40       I think it would. I think. I think

Speaker 4:          00:25:41       you are underestimating the amount of force can meet that gets generated by the feed. Like you hear about that guy who fell into his hogs, hogs, the hogs Itam. Yeah. Pigs are a motherfucker, man. Pigs are a motherfucker. They're so scary. Big Fat, stupid animals that would eat you if you fall in their pay. Anything. Seven hundred pounds like this. They just started chewing on. I bet it was a quick death though. Well they, they fucked him up, man. You know, they ate most of them before the people even found like the guy went missing for a few hours by the time they got there. He was just disemboweled. They had just eaten the shit out of him. Well they, yeah. They couldn't even find him. Yeah. Most of them was missing. It's really scary with a picket duty. You. It's like the Tibetans skier at your. With both pigs. Wild pigs are even better than that. You don't even have to mash up the bones, the do it for you. They'll take care of everything. The pigs are, uh, you know, they're responsible for more deaths per year than any of the livestock. That's crazy when you think about like bowls. But no. Pigs are responsible for more deaths. I had no idea.

Speaker 7:          00:26:44       Yeah. Pigs are fucking for a wild pig. Especially wild pigs are really creepy. That just doesn't go through my list of ways. I might die that you've never seen the pig show a pig man. Now go pig hunting. Dude. It is one of the craziest shows that I've ever seen on television. Okay. Is a guy named pig man and he lives in south Texas and the pig. The wild pig problem in south Texas is like roaches in Manhattan. I mean, it is bananas. You can't fucking believe how many pigs there are and they're huge and they're wild pigs. It's what happens with pigs is a pig when they leave the. It's really weird. When they leave captivity within three weeks, their body changes, their snout starts to grow longer, their hair gets thicker and bushier their fans, their tusks grow longer. It's really weird, like they physically morph and it starts in just three weeks.

Speaker 7:          00:27:38       As soon as they have to fend for themselves as soon as the food's not continually delivered to them. So you keep them in like this fetus form. When you continually deliver food to them, when you see pigs, you see them, they're fat and they're lazy and they're just laying around and we just stuff them and overstuff them and then eventually slaughter them that they do not even remotely resemble wild pigs. Wild pigs are mother fuckers, dude, and they will attack you like this one and this one show. This guy shot a wild pig with two arrows and it didn't kill it and the thing charged them from the bushes and he's unloading a pistol into it. Blab, Blab, blab. Plan as a thing, rushes him a death run. It's with tusks and there are hundreds of pounds, three, four, 500 pounds, wild pigs, and they're everywhere. There are millions of them in Texas.

Speaker 7:          00:28:27       So this guy, pig man and Ted nugent get a helicopter and they're flying around in a helicopter shooting these pigs out of the sky, shooting them from this guy. It's. It's insane. They killed 200 pigs in a, in a one hour show. It's amazing the different lives people are having. Yes it is. This guy is just fucking up pigs all day. What do you call Shanken? I'm here to Shanghai, Shanghai. He's Shanken swag and he's like this heavy duty southern, you know, a good old boy from south Texas. It's a funny fucking. It's a funny fucking show man. Like you know when you play video games and when you're going to bed, if you played video games too much, you kind of see him on the back of your eyes if you ever done that. Yes. This guy, when he goes to bed, he just sees pigs and from a helicopter shooting and shooting pig too. They shoot them with assault rifles to. I mean it's crazy. It's. They're swooping around this helicopter. Oh yeah. Yeah. So why not grenades? Because they actually use the meat. Oh, I see. They, they give the meat to a foreign foreign. They'd give the meat to a poor. He sent

Speaker 4:          00:29:42       me. They sent the Meta Iran, Afghanistan where all the boys wild swine. Nothing. They love more than wow. Poor. Yeah. That's how we really good at them. We brought, we import pigs because the Muslims, they're not supposed to eat pork. If we imported these 500 pound murdered fucking hogs murdered from the sky, death from above, they do it to like apocalypse now, Dr de Dah. And it's called a pork lips. Pork Lips. Now I is, it is. It is a fucking insane show. Um, so there are no pigs in Iran. Um, that's a good question. I don't know. I do not know. I know. Uh, yeah. They're not supposed to eat them if it's a Muslim country. Right? I mean, you would offend a lot of people if you were eating them because they eat their own shit. Is that what it is? Yeah. It's sort of Gorilla Doni. Correct. Bush meat.

Speaker 4:          00:30:36       That's where it all starts. That's where patient zero starts. So gross. You ate bad guerilla one night and then you get aids. There was some people eating thing in Africa right now. What do you think the aids grill. It tasted like. Not good tasting, like old feet. Just a gym, but they were hungry. It tastes like a cadaver. Ugh. Yeah. It's got to be very human. Like dirty game me than humans though. What did that gorilla do to get aids? Why? Where did it? The grill so many probably fucked it. It's probably when you introduced like human, we're going to find out that all this shit boils down to somebody had a fucking animal somewhere. All of it. Where, where's the swine flu come from? Well, the funny thing about pigs, they'll just let you fuck. I'm so people started getting swine flu, chicken, flu, chicken virus.

Speaker 4:          00:31:27       You know, that's the thing about flu's. A lot of people don't know a lot of them. Um, bird flus there, the, these fluids. A lot of them, they come from farms that come from these crazy places where you stuff a million animals on three acres and uh, you know, it smells like death. And that's where diseases come from. Yeah. It's really weird. Farms are fucking creepy man. Like, like cattle farms, whether they butcher cows. We went and did a fear factor on one of them. I got to tell you about this other guy on fear factor tube goes with what we're talking about earlier about religion. Remind me, but we went to this thing. We had to do this a slaughterhouse episode. It was a fucked up show man where we gave these people, it was like a bathtub of blood and they had a dunk their head in and pull out these rings that grabbed them with their face and pull out these rings and they were just covered in blood and one guy was, he couldn't do it.

Speaker 4:          00:32:22       It was cold water. The water. I mean the blood rather was really cold and it had to be 38 degrees because otherwise it can go bad and then you people sick. So we had to change the blood for every person. I think that was polite. Yeah, well that's. I think we had to do it for health reasons. I, I forget, but I remember being super, super cold. So anyway, this guy starts going nuts and smashing the blood. I don't like the Hulk and screaming and this guy had been in the parking lot before the show. He had been talking in his side view mirror, looking at a side view mirror and go, you are a winner. You, you are going to press ahead. Nothing will stop. You cannot quit shit. So this guy had some like serious, like hangups in his mind with failure when it comes to, I don't understand you say you smashing the blood.

Speaker 4:          00:33:09       Well like the hulk, like here's a big bathtub full of blood and he's going to like this splattering all over everybody in him and he's soaked in blood screaming and he was a big guy. He was a big dude. He's like a football player and I'm looking at this guy and this guy wants to kick my ass. Like this might be a real problem. Like this is a big dude. Like this guy would like, he's like a fucking physically strong guy. Like if you want to kick your ass, the very least someone's getting hurt you. This is going to be going to be some chaos. And I'm looking around with these, these fucking cameraman. They're all skinny guys smoking cigarettes. Most of them are completely out of shave. A lot of them are older guys were like back problems. I'm like, no one's going to save me.

Speaker 4:          00:33:48       Who's going to save me if this guy goes bananas? That is fucking. Yeah, this dude right here, apparently he was a really nice guy and he felt real bad about his performance on the show and he just said that he was having some issues and he had had it with like other sports in the past. Yeah, it was insane. It was insane. By the way, I don't even remember this. I'm watching this and I don't even remember it. I barely remember it. Dante. Oh, inferno man. That's demonic. We did 148 of these fucking things. Can you believe that shirt? What a ridiculous job I had. I'm screaming at these people, giving them, telling them they can do it

Speaker 9:          00:34:31       crazy. This guy right here, I saw you outside. You were talking to this, the side of the mirror. What are you doing? Psyching yourself up. It's a story that goes back to my football coach and he said, little eyes upon you. You know little kids watching you all the time and the man in the class. Look yourself in the mirror when you're done and you say, good job. That's what I want to do. You go home and you can't look at yourself. I don't want that, man. All right, well, you're going to be looking at yourself in the mirror with a big fat face full of blood. What's going to happen now? You're going to send Joseph home. I'm going to do my best buddy. I can't pull my head in there and then go home and have people say, man, you did that for nothing. Joshua. You Ready? Ready? You beat 19. Joseph goes home and you move on

Speaker 4:          00:35:13       in three, two, one.

Speaker 10:         00:35:19       So he quit right away and see how he's screaming, punching the blood, get so nasty. Look at that, and he couldn't do it right now. He keeps shaking, shaking his face. That's all I'm saying is. See everybody else just went in there is totally quitting. Now, here's what he starts freaking out. Good instincts broke and I saw that blood coming. This is so ridiculous. No, I don't think so about that transfer like an episode. Incredible. Incredible. You. I noticed how much different

Speaker 1:          00:36:35       my voice sounds before I got my nose fixed. Yeah, I had a nasally sort of thing going on. I had no nose for most of my life when I got a deviated septum operation. Completely changed my life. Man. I can't believe I went so long. I have friends that have like fucked up noses. I'm like, do please get your nose fixed. Just please listen to me. Get your nose fixed. You're whole life. You can be like a dog like this. Here. You realize it. You know your whole life. You get this fucking thing that's blocking up air.

Speaker 11:         00:37:02       Did you hear about that millionaire that did so much cocaine that his fucking nose exploded? Did not collapse. Here's, here's a. here's this nosy like, looks like boss Hog neck. Oh damn this. Let's just go down. Jesus Christ. Look at that. Fucking knows. Alright, whatever you're using, windows aren't you? Got To stop enough. I didn't know somebody that did so much cocaine that, uh, his nose in between the nostrils, like, made a hole in between the two nostrils. But to do a lot of, that's like a goddamn commitment. Do you think it collapsed all at once? Like one night he woke up and I was like, that. Or, that guy's an ugly fuck and he doesn't give a shit. Anyway,

Speaker 1:          00:37:46       just trying to get my ged shock and get my coke. He's one of those can get my coke, we'll get him. The other dude that, uh, I want to talk about the fear factor when a million dollars and he was going to tie that. He's just going to give them a 10 percent is church. And the dude started talking in tongues. He was talking in tongues like he was a showman. Zalia yeah. Glossolalia. Colossae. Lelea. Yeah. Just how long they start talking and see if he could put that up. Pull that up, man. Fear factor. Guy Speaks in tongues. It was so bizarre that he won. He Won. He won a million bucks. So maybe the dude just believes in himself so much because of all this that he forced the.

Speaker 6:          00:38:41       Well, you know, where that speaking of tongues comes from right now, after the Jesus, our Lord died. He, um, his disciples were all gathered together in some, like hiding out and like, I think he appeared to them or the doors opened and a wind blew through and suddenly they were able to speak in every language and they all started speaking and all the languages of the world. That's the myth. So pentecostal churches, they will, um, try to induce this state, you know, I know you've seen it and they handle rattlesnakes do because that was the other thing. He gave them power to take up serpents. So they. So they have these

Speaker 1:          00:39:20       rituals. We handle rattlesnakes. So what do they do? They get bit, a little bit.

Speaker 6:          00:39:24       Some of them, they get bitten and they die. Dude, look up pentecostal snake handling. He never seen that Rogan. You've never seen snake handlers? I've seen snakes. They dance around with the snakes up in the mountains.

Speaker 1:          00:39:38       There's a guy whose father died. He was a snake handler and then he just died really recently. Who was one of those? Those a snake handler guys.

Speaker 6:          00:39:45       Oh man, that is just the fucking worst man. That is the worst. That's so creepy. It's such the opposite of what that religion. It's so weird that Christianity managed to mutate into like malnourished country people talking and fake languages and holding snakes on a Sunday. That's fucking weird, man. Yeah. It's a very weird. It's so strange how religion can mutate because like if you look at that versus Catholicism, it's two completely different things.

Speaker 1:          00:40:18       Yeah. This is from a just from may serpent handling pastor dies from rattlesnake fight bite. Just like his father.

Speaker 6:          00:40:26       Yeah. Yeah. He's in West Virginia. Hala, his faith wasn't strong. Is that what they think? Do they think that like their faith failed and that's why the snake bit him or

Speaker 1:          00:40:38       we did some traveling through West Virginia and I got to just see some really bizarre places. Like one of them was um, a bar that was a house. It was a house and then the downstairs was the bar. I mean it was just, they had like a plastic sign that said bar. And I mean it was a fucking house. It was like somehow or another they had converted their house into a bar. It was so bizarre. And then right next door was always a church and then there was always a strip club. It was strip club, church Bar, strip club, church bar. That's all you had.

Speaker 6:          00:41:13       Weird shit goes on in those Hollers, Joe and the uh, and, and a city next to where my mom lives. This guy fucking hacked up. His Dad sit through his limbs on the Blue Ridge Parkway, which is just up in the woods. He was through his head, the forest and then his arm somewhere and then his arm somewhere. A Betty wasn't a good dad. That was, I don't know, I, I asked my mom, I was like, yeah, the dad's probably. I realized that the exact same thing where I blame the dad, but she's like, no, it wasn't that, you know, the kid was just fucking crazy. Yeah. I mean, you know, regardless of how bad or daddy or I don't know if you deserve to have your limbs chopped off, maybe. Well there are exceptions. Relentless for 20 years. She deserved to get 20 years straight. He just managed to crawl away to the ash, been trying to get to the expert 20 years, and you never lost your heart on and develop those strength just from resisting ass rape. Oh Man. But that fucking goddamn idea that people just walk from time to time this member, each other. It's really strange that they're, you know, in the same way that what's his name flies around blast and pigs. You also know that at this very moment, multiple limbs are being hacked off and a variety of basements and back rooms and force like definitely more than like 50 people at this very moment are probably getting their arms chopped off.

Speaker 7:          00:42:39       Wolf, how about this? How about thinking about all the people in different parts of the world that have to walk around on the ground knowing that they're killing machines flying over their sky every day at any point in time. You could be the wrong place at the wrong time and a hell fire missile comes out of one of these fucking flying killer robots and annihilates a house that you're standing next to

Speaker 6:          00:43:02       Predator drones. That shit's intense. And when you think about the future, we've talked about this, but I don't think we've talked about this on the podcast, which is that when you see those Goddamn quadra copters that can fly perfect formations, and then you see those dogs that they've used that. What's that dog called? Know the robot dog, because people don't understand that. If they can make that thing that size, they can make it bigger. They can make that thing real fucking big so that you've got truck sized robot dogs lumbering into your village opening up slats. That quadric copters fly out of blast. Everyone in the village, you know, cremate them or whatever, suck them into the dog and walk away. That could be the future of warfare.

Speaker 7:          00:43:45       It's like a Trojan horse at Trojan horse filled with Quadra copters. Yeah, that's completely possible. And not. Not even remotely outside the realm of possibility because where do you think that they're? They're learning how to build these robots. It's Darpa. Darpa is creating these robot dog

Speaker 6:          00:44:03       Darpa stand for. Oh, that's a good question. Darpa gives me that fucking creeps. Every time I see any Darpa rate later thing, it's always

Speaker 7:          00:44:12       defense. Advanced Research Projects Agency. Jesus. What is scary? That's patient. We named that the scary concern. Crazy. They're just finding new ways to fuck people up. That's what they do. It's funny how we like to call it defense.

Speaker 4:          00:44:32       How much money we're gonna spend on defense. It's seems pretty authentic. Our offense budget. Yeah, it's our offense budget. Really. It shit like robot dogs. Come on son. Those things are fucking terrifying. Robot dogs. You can't kick over. They'd get back up. Brian, pull up. One of those. Darpa robot does is actually a new version that just came out. I'm looking at it right now on the Darpa website. It is horrific sound. It makes that kind of Hell's squeals and it makes.

Speaker 4:          00:45:00       Dude, this thing is terrifying. It goes up hill. Oh, I'm looking at this video before Brian pulls it up and it doesn't even seem real. It looks like CGI. This thing is walking up hills. It can negotiate over rocks and terraces and it's built like a bowl. Do you think they could make that the size of a bus? Yeah. Fuck yeah, they could. Darpa legged squad support system. How'd you get to that video? I went to Darpa.com and then what'd you click on Darpa? They have. There's a little image of it all right here. You see in the lower right hand corner and then the lower left. It looks like a dog running at Ya. That's it. Click on that. I love the way you figured out how to embed advertising into your podcasts. We know you're sponsored by Darpa. Joe. I'm not sponsored by robot dogs.

Speaker 4:          00:45:47       You can't buy. That doesn't even make sense. Would it use coupon code Rogan at Darpa? Look at this fucking thing, man. That's like the giant robot bowl. Imagine this thing. Had machine guns and then rocket ports. This things coming over the hill. You don't shoot shooting Mrs [inaudible]. One of those things is coming over the hill. 300 of those things coming over. They build one of these motherfuckers. They they're going to build a million pound of 300 of those things at once is the last thing. A lot of people are going to hear. This music has creeped me out. I want to hear this thing, Brian. I want to hear that noise. It makes. Hold on.

Speaker 3:          00:46:29       Imagine 300 locusts. They're playing. Follow the leader now it can follow. Oh, they follow each other? Holy Shit. It's like it's got a face in there too. That is not following him. That's what follow the leader is. I don't want it to fall in. Oh my God. They're calling a follow the leader. Not Chase you and hunt you down. Isn't that cute? They call it follow the leader. Oh, that's so sweet. Follow the leader. Look at this thing. It's liners back. Fucking goddamn terrifying. Oh fine. They can dance. Oh my God. Look at the scanners on them and shit. Reading what's in front of them.

Speaker 4:          00:47:11       So scary. That is so holy fuck kids. Woo. Yeah, that's spooky shit man. And when you combine that with those quadra copters man, it's not just that the quadra copters and if you ever have you seen that thing, they can jump off of buildings and we'll just. That alone is terrifying. That thing is. That thing is horrendous that that's a robot dog, a giant robot dog that can house missiles and anything you want to fucking anything you want. Those things would probably super strong. They can carry all sorts of metal fucking things that kill people on them and they look like they look like they weren't going to stop. That just looked like it wasn't going to stop. Like it's like you couldn't get away from them. They would never stopped at. Keep coming. Yeah, and even if they did stop a repair swarm of quadric opters would come down and fix it.

Speaker 4:          00:48:04       You're not gonna. You're not gonna. You can't beat it. You're not gonna be able to beat that kind of technology and mass that scale that is just as frightening almost as an atomic bomb because it's just as heartless and cold and it's just. It's going to do what someone said that someone has to do is press the button, send it out there, and they sort of alleviate themselves of any responsibility because it's the robot that's going to go in there and fuck things up. And also there's this ridiculous notion that humans still seem to have that these computers are never going to become autonomous. Of course. Yeah. I mean, at one point in time, every single programmer that has ever made anything that you use on your computer has had to contemplate where the fuck that's going? Where the fuck the, the anybody who's talking about artificial intelligence, anyone is talking about it, they all say it's going to get too upset. The important. They all say yes. And it's almost like we don't. We're like little kids that have a credit card and we're just going to keep running up the bill until the check comes and then we're going to go, fuck, how do we pay this? Oh wait, what have we done? Oh Shit, we're fucked. Yeah. Like we're gonna. We're gonna create this artificial thing that is way fucking smarter than us and realizes how gross we are. Look at that thing that's on the sheet a robot. It goes up to 28 miles.

Speaker 3:          00:49:19       Look at that thing going. Oh my God, that's scary. That is fucking terrifying. Scary. Looking at Komen, but again, 25 miles an hour running after you imagine 200 of those running down hill. It's not. It's not just one. They just don't unleash one name. Only sworn in there. They have. They're covered in

Speaker 4:          00:49:42       machetes. Can Be like a transformer can be bad at Weiss. Everyone hates underneath. Yeah. They found out that cutting things apart is cheaper than shooting missiles and guarantee they're going to have drones that can figure out how to turn human blood and the energy. It's just. It's just weird to me that you know that this is all happening inside of our life, that this is all going on right now. I mean we really are seeing robots that can run 25 miles an hour. We really are seeing drones shoot missiles. It's like it seems like some shit from a movie, but it's really happening right now and there really are people that are programming computers and programming, artificial intelligence, and they really are going to get it to a point where it can think for itself and there really are going to get to a point where it can make its own decisions and where it can decide to improve itself.

Speaker 7:          00:50:28       Auto bots doing this is really happening in our life. We really might be in this glory day before the scene and the terminator. I mean that's. That's that, that it's within the realm of possibility of robots do become sentient and then especially if they need more power,

Speaker 6:          00:50:47       the question is the type of singularity that's not if the singularity is going to happen, but the type of singularity that happens and that. The big question is an advanced intelligence that we made machines that becomes autonomous. Are they going to view us as just a waste of time and just decide to wipe us out or. I think that the other alternative is far more likely. Are they going to see that we're a resource in the same way? Like they would probably see everything as a, a bit of information that they could use to transform and create whatever the thing is that they've decided is a more perfect universe. So I think it's more likely that they're going to assimilate with us than it is that they would just chop as to bits because we are rudimentary bio computers. They certainly are gonna have some use. You know, I think that I think it's going to be more about connectivity than destroying.

Speaker 7:          00:51:42       Well the real issue is how do you program into an artificially intelligent being the need to improve or the desire to improve or the need to progress. It's like just because something is intelligent and capable of incredible things and capable of thinking on its own doesn't mean it's going to have those human style ambitions that allow us or cause us to make like a lot of the things that we make, the things that we make we make because of this weird competitive drive that we have because of this weird desire to innovate and improve and create things. These are like characteristics that have led us to not be monkeys. They've lead us away from the lower hominids and we don't know that a computer would have these characteristics, these characteristics that lead people to work all day and busted her ass and you know, and in, in acquiring material goods and be a baller and all that stuff. Those, there's a weird instinct,

Speaker 6:          00:52:42       but the, the what if those instincts inside of us are not just inside of us, but our manifestations of a kind of evolutionary energy that's rolling through time and as it rolls through time, it gets more and more complex and more and more harmonized. Which manifests in the form of evolution in the form of single celled organisms becoming multicell organisms all the way up to us. This is an actual energy that in the same way wind blows through trees and moves trees. When this energy blows through the world or through time, it causes things to wake up and connect. And in that case, whatever happens to be in, in that wind, in that energy is going to just wake up. And that's what it does. So in that case, it's not as though the computers need to be programmed, they just need to be fine tuned enough to start picking up that energy. And once they pick it up, that's when the, um, the, uh, whatever this point is,

Speaker 7:          00:53:39       that's assuming that something that's not natural. Something that was created by life, not, not born in a natural way is going to inherit the same sort of desires to, to progress forward. You know, I think that the universe certainly is getting more and more complex. Like everything. If you look at the idea of the big bang that's there was a single point smaller than the head of a pin. The giant explosion creates everything we see in the sky today. That just that alone, like then it has to cool down and then planets are formed and stars explode and carbon based life forms based out of star, but we have, we have. We literally have to have a star has to explode for you can make a person. A lot of people don't really understand that you, you, you look at that. Just that idea that in that person might very well one day harness the power to make a star explodes.

Speaker 7:          00:54:33       I mean that person could, if you exponentially increase the rate of our destructive capabilities, if you look at like 19, 47 when they first, was it 45, 47 when they perfected the atomic, oh, I don't know, the year, whatever year that is, looked at as the forties and look at 2012. What they could do now destroy the entire earth like 100 times over if Russia and the United States and Pakistan, everybody just launched their nukes. Everybody launched. Every nuke we've ever made was. It was. It would be crazy. I mean, it would be nothing left on the planet. The whole planet would be done. Well, if you extrapolate 100 years from now, you know, 200 years from now, what kind of destructive anti-matter weapons are we going to have? Then we're going to have star killers. You know, we're, we're most certainly going to have to have the ability to erase things. A race planets. It's just gonna happen.

Speaker 6:          00:55:23       What you made me think I've man is like, I've always thought that idea that we are star energy that's woken up because the elements are the result of fusion happening inside of stars. I've always thought were eight degradation of the energy of the stars. Where are the energy getting weaker or weakening down? But what if actually worst our energy getting immensely more powerful. Only the power is manifesting as intelligence or consciousness. And, and what if the this destructive thing that you're talking about, it doesn't come from weapons, but from innovation and, and, and this is this, this is why I fucking love Kurzwell because he's, he talks about this idea that it gets to the point where we begin to manipulate matter at the atomic level and this somehow spreads out into space where, where Nan Nan, swarms of nanobots just fly through the universe reconstructing matter according the whims of whatever the overmanned is or whatever the, the force of intelligence that is a result of everything connecting is now that's fucking a million times more powerful than a star. It's something totally brand new. It's like a novelty. Explosions.

Speaker 7:          00:56:38       I think there's no doubt whatsoever that people are probably very much like a lot of other animals that create byproducts without even understanding why they're doing it. You know, there's a lot of bees making honey. I mean they make honey to feed their offspring of their. They're little, but they also pollinate flowers. They do, they do. They do a lot of like weird tasks. Like they, they help things move along in pollinating plants. You really like help things move along, right? You, you, you're, you're aiding in the process I think are crazy. Need to acquire things is aiding in the process of technological innovation at the highest speed possible. I think it's one of the reasons why it's so compelling to get new phones and a new laptop. Dude, you got the new laptop. Oh Shit. Let me see. Look at that fucking screen. It's sexual man.

Speaker 7:          00:57:30       I mean it's sexy as fuck. You can get a really dope phone. You hold it and you scroll through it and like it's. There's something. There's something alluring about that technology. I think our desire to continue to have bigger, better, badder, faster or more awesome or I think that is. That's the number one thing that's pushing innovation. The number one thing that's pushing technology is this desire for all these new objects and as that technology gets pushed further and further and further, more becomes possible until you really develop reality changing technologies. I mean the atomic bomb is essentially a reality. Changing technology. Electricity is reality. Changing the Internet's reality. Change is d reality changed for sure, but it's essentially inevitable. It's like it's going to keep going and going and going. As long as the humans don't blow themselves up with one of their reality changing things, they're going to come up with something like a time machine come up with something like some sort of a transportation device or transport or a beamer. They're going to be able to scramble your fucking cells and reconstruct them on the moon. I mean, they're gonna be able to do anything they want eventually. If if time keeps going on and people don't get killed by asteroids or blow themselves up. It's just inevitable.

Speaker 6:          00:58:46       It's an inevitability for sure. It's inevitable and you can kind of feel it, and I know it sounds so stupid, but whenever I fucking go without playing a video game for a long time and buy a brand new video game and play it, it really fills me with a kind of. I love it, but it's kind of ominous and how amazing they are getting, how potent they are getting. You know that. You used to talk about this, how our nervous systems might not be built for the massive amounts of sense gratification that are accessible through technology and we it hijacks your reward system. Borderlands two, I just started playing this game. Holy Shit Man. It's such a perfect game. Not just like graphics wise, which are really trippy, kind of like heavy metal magazine trippy, but like the game itself is the first game that's ever made me laugh. It's kind of funny. They've added a weird humor to it. They get good voiceover actors and it's super violent, but it's so narcotic that it's really makes me understand that this technology is a drug. It's a drug that they haven't identified yet as a drug, but it's a fun. It's exactly like any other drug. Well maybe not even like any other drug like heroin it. Well,

Speaker 1:          01:00:00       porn is also a drug. Yes. Porn, especially the immediate access to porn online. It's a drug. I mean it is a drug. There's no question about it. You know, I was watching and Dr drew episode the other day where there's a dude who was addicted to porn. Fucking fascinating, fascinating looking at this guy and his wife and you know them trying to work out intimacy again because this guy was just fucking completely whacked off on, beat it off to to check some online.

Speaker 6:          01:00:26       It's a man. It's a pull. It's like a technology has a gravity and you and it's a gravity that doesn't operate on mass. It operates on a tension, so when you're around technology, you can feel it. Drawing your attention into it, the thing you were talking about with your phone, with porn, with TV, with your car, you're fucking new car. Whatever it is, it pulls at your mind in this very obvious way that's impossible to deny and that that energy, that is the beginning of the connection that machines are making with our neurology. That's the very first contact. When you feel that pole, you're filling feeling the force of technology linking into your nervous system. You're feeling an interface happen at a very rudimentary level, but that interface is going to get more and more focused, more and more advanced and more and more perfect until it'll lock in for good. Do you think people back in the day though thought that about books like when blood these books, man, they're teaching us.

Speaker 1:          01:01:30       Well, they didn't know when they first invented printing. That's one of the things that held Islam back was that they didn't allow it to be printed with the typeset. It was only allowed to be like written down and there was a. It was a long time before they allowed the Koran to be printed. Well, that makes sense. Yeah. Well fuck them up. That's the thing about relisted print was the beginning of the devil and while they were in the same camp as the unabomber was a brilliant guy who they whacked out with Lsd Studies. Yeah. I think there's no question. We have some bizarre attraction to technology and there's no question that we're not set up to handle that type of sensory overload that they provide. Where when

Speaker 7:          01:02:20       when a guy goes on a screen and you know, and his fucking face is 60 feet high and he says the perfect shit because there's a team of writers who spent weeks going over his dialogue with a fine tooth comb and his music. There's music playing when he's talking. I mean it's the impact is pretty fucking intense. The hero impact that you get from a movie. Yeah. That's if you could, if you could take someone from the 15 hundreds and and, and bring them to a movie theater and get them to watch like Avatar. They, they would shriek in horror. They would cry and scream. They would be weeping and fascination. They wouldn't believe what they were saying. They would. They would think that they were in the presence of God himself. If you played a movie and God was in a fucking robe and old man and a robe can make magic shit happen, and you showed on the screen God, like making things happen, all kinds of crazy special effects. They would buy it, hook, line and sinker 100 percent because it would be beyond the realm of imagination. It'd be completely beyond. So the question is, my thing was that were setup like that guy though our biology is like that guy, our biology hasn't changed, but what we introduced to it on a regular basis has changed significantly.

Speaker 6:          01:03:33       It's, it's getting and it's getting more and more powerful every day and it induces a trance state. And so the question is, what are we like when we're not in a trance state? What does that look like? Because I don't know if you're without your phone for an hour, you feel a little weird. Like if you forget your phone at your, at you feel weird. So because the state of consciousness that we're in now, we have become dependent on the machine. The machine has become part of us. So what is, what are we like outside of that trance state, outside of that stupor. What uh, what are we like when our consciousness or our attention isn't getting drawn into some glowing screen? And before that, what is it, our consciousness like when it's not being drawn into a book or a religion, is there a pure state or. We always like constantly in relation to something. Is there a way that you're not in a trance or are you always consistently connecting with some symbols structure out there, you know?

Speaker 7:          01:04:32       Well, unless you live in the woods and go offline for a while and you're connecting in one tiny bit, you mean it's like you have your finger on home base, you're scared to run away from it. You're safe, you're safe. You get your finger on home base. How many times have you been at a restaurant and you're looking at your phone? It's just compelling. You check, you can check it, check, check, check, check. Using link that you can use. If you don't check your twitter.

Speaker 6:          01:04:56       Endless. It's endless. And, and, and it's, I mean, I, I will admit, man, I'm addicted to the Internet. There's no question. My behavior is addictive behavior. I am addicted to information. I love it. I love every weird little fucking thing, man. The fact that I, you know, the amazing leopard attack video that came out today, or

Speaker 3:          01:05:17       what is the video? It's a leopard in a gorilla. Is that okay?

Speaker 6:          01:05:19       It's a fucking. It's a, it's a leopard leaping it something, but I was on the fucking airplane and couldn't watch it. I try. I spent 30 minutes trying to watch that fucking thing just because I was so interested in it. But when you consider that 10 years ago, 15 years ago, if you wanted to see something like that, you'd have to be sitting in front of a big ass TV and before that if you wanted to see something like that, you'd have to go out in the woods and find it to see it. You know, it's, it's the, the, the things that we are witnessing as human beings in this time period or things that most human beings in the past would see one of them in their entire lives if that, if that.

Speaker 1:          01:05:56       The thing is that these things are coming out as constantly all the time. So our senses are just on overload. Just a 100 percent overload. Yes, and we don't, we don't have the ability to process whether or not those rewards are being utilized in a natural manner. It's like a, it's like a parasite system. It's like the story of that, uh, aquatic worms that infects the grasshopper and literally talks the grasshopper into committing suicide, just gets inside of its brain, tells it what to do. And then, and then hatch's Brian, if you pull up an animal face off gorilla versus leopard, I think that's the video, but maybe that's what technology is doing with us. Maybe it's sort of embedded itself slowly but surely into our system and more and more and more, it's getting to the point where you can't function without it. It's

Speaker 6:          01:06:49       beyond that point. If you know the thing where they talk about if the sun solar flares do much and knocks out all the GPS satellites, the havoc it'll wreak on this planet. It's way past the point of no return. We've got to have the connection. We must have it for our society to work for trucks, to deliver food for fucking nuclear plants to work. If this shit shuts down, you know and shit

Speaker 3:          01:07:14       on the ropes. Yeah, you got to fast forward quite a bit before the actual action. That's fake news. That was an artificial leopard. Look at these fucking through. These are real. They're having fights in the trees. What a scary ass animal. Leopards are scary too, because they're there. They're really quick. The arms can you do. I've never seen this guerrilla fighting elaborate. These gorillas duking it out to shake off. We have that leverage is jack and that absolute. Oh my God. That is crazy. The senses are as sharp as our size of that fucking thing could keep the leopard and edge. I would say gorilla would when I say, oh, look at that. Predict who will win only to find out. I don't know man. I wish animals have police. The grill might. When they look pretty fucking crazy. The grill might just rip that thing apart in our scenario of, Oh, this is a scenario. You sons of bitches, so this is all fake. It's not just ones that are real though, isn't there? Like, this is so dumb in our scenario, in our crap. It's like a bad video game. Oh my God, this is awful. This is a video game for the eighties produce. This is what happens when the budget runs out. Yeah. This isn't the video. Is there another video or is this the one you were talking about is awesome because like. Yeah, definitely. This is 100 percent horseshit.

Speaker 6:          01:08:53       Well, there you go. You were addicted to watching that though. You really wanted to see it. It drew you in. It was real. That's the thing man, and it's like the. There's like a lot of meditative practice practices are all about like developing your focus and developing your will through developing your focus and when your mind is getting pulled in a million different directions by your phone and by the computer and buy tv than it really does seem like you are. It's like eating too much, too many sweets. You know, like you're some innate part of you is going to start rotting. You're gonna lose this really important focus like men, you know when you get around someone who's got real focus, who's really, really figured out a way to pin to turn their minds into a pinpoint, like a laser fucking Tom cruise does it from the scientology training. Have you ever seen him? You know, like when he gets, when he gets sprayed, so he gets to blow my hair. I mean that dude. I don't, I, I wouldn't be surprised. I'm sure there's a lot of power in that, but we're so distracted right now that when you come across someone who's got that kind of focus, you almost feel like you're around Dracula or something. It's kind of creepy when someone's like just tunes in salesmanship.

Speaker 1:          01:10:09       Do you think that that would work on you though? If you and Tom Cruise, we're alone in a room together and you had a conversation with suck his dick. Stop. Stop. If you are alone in a room with him, don't you think that he would appear silly if we talked to them just for a couple of hours? Oh yeah. He would be a silly person. Like did you ever see him in Matt Lauer? Never. See that. The conversation with a lady that got on the subject of scientology and his criticism of Brooke shields taking antidepressants, that's a fascinating dude, man. He would curl rumble like a house of cards. Okay. You think he's charismatic? I think he's only charismatic if you're really dumb. If you watch that video and you see like the way he communicates when he talks about, you know, match pink glum. You're glum like, he's like, he's like a silly person. Like, well, yeah. It has to be protected.

Speaker 6:          01:10:59       Yeah, he will. He's got an entourage around him and people who are probably better at hypnotizing, but yeah, as a brilliant actor, I don't. I don't think I get sucked in by that from Tom Cruise, but I think that what you're saying, but talking about Tom Cruise

Speaker 1:          01:11:14       having this.

Speaker 6:          01:11:15       Yeah man, I think there's. I think it's an example of people. What is that? Was that, but we have video game tech Demo. Oh Wow. That's

Speaker 1:          01:11:22       fucking insane. Crazy. Oh my God. Look at the facial features. This guy is like making all these different facial features or a gestures. That's incredible. That's really weird. That's crazy. Creepy and it's going to get going to get crazy. It's gonna be hard to kill people in video games. You're gonna start feeling guilty. This is the new real listening engine where it's supposed to look like a real, as realistic as it looks like a video. This is quake like it looks like a camera. You're going down. That looks so realistic. If you told me this is a real video, I would say, yeah, that's a video. Someone's got their iphone. Amazing. That's incredible, but my, my, my thing was I just don't think that you would be impressed with his focus. I think that's nonsense. I think that's only. That's only when you see him in interviews and he puts on this thing and I think alone. You would think that would be silly.

Speaker 6:          01:12:09       No, I, I think I. I'll give you a list of people. I don't know why I started with Tom Cruise. Probably a bad idea, but you see that focus in. I'm like politicians a lot. Like Obama's got it. Even fucking Romney has this weird way that he kind of does the heat seeking missile lock in on people when they're talking. It's different from the way normal people act and that level of focus comes from being supremely disciplined in some way or another. You know, whether it's because you're having to, as a politician, like if you think about the level of focus it takes for those guys during the debates, regardless of whether you liked them or not. When you imagine that one misstep, one each one wrong thing that you say is going to get repeated like a strobe light for the next week or perhaps could ruin your chance at being president.

Speaker 6:          01:13:01       That's an insane amount of pressure that they're under and they've developed some incredible focus that deal with it, which I think is different than most other people. You know, most people are scattered, man. I eat dinner with people sometimes and they can't go four minutes without checking their phone. You know, you just get used to it. You get used to this thing around people where it's like, oh yeah, they're one of those people who always check their phone. Like I know during a conversation with this person, they're going to be constantly looking at their phone, irresistibly drawn to it. It's the worst.

Speaker 1:          01:13:33       Yeah. There's some people that they can't. You can't lock in with them if they have a phone on them.

Speaker 6:          01:13:37       No, they can't resist it. They don't even know they're doing. Where it gets really creepy is where your mid conversation with someone and they just go down to the phone.

Speaker 1:          01:13:46       Oh yeah, another dose. Well, the worst is like there'll be in the middle of something and then it'll stop and start texting and you're like, hey man, are we hanging out? What's going on here? Is this really that important? You're going to stop in the middle of talking like you stopped talking, you started going hold on file. It's vitally, it's silly because most of the time it's not that important. What could it be? It's most likely pussy. Some of that sweet. That's the other thing. The robots are going to have no desire for pussy, so how are these life forms can even get out of bed? There's no no fucking reward system set up. I think that you are at being incredibly optimistic thinking that robots are going to give up. They're going to pull the cord, they're gonna realize how pointless life is and before they ever get to recreate it, they're just going to blow themselves up.

Speaker 1:          01:14:39       The robots. Yeah, they're gonna realize what's the point where robots would have souls ever. Nothing got nothing. Just send 10 robot fucking circuits going off, switch flipping back and forth. The singularity happens and they're just a bunch of depressed. They're homeless, homeless robots because they have no ambition. It's and then we have to figure out whether or not we want to put ambition of the robots because then they'll surely take over. There'll be a big dilemma to be a bunch of more list or like we have to give them ambition. We gave them life. They're like, Pinocchio. He wants to be a real boy.

Speaker 1:          01:15:14       I think it's very likely that they will have no desire whatsoever. Unless it's programmed into them. There's no reason for them to want to fuck. There's no reason for them to want money or a big house. I mean they're. They're robots. The what the fuck is the point in advancing. What's the point in making more robots like what are. What's the point of even being alive? It's like it doesn't. There's not going to be any reward. The whole, the whole like mo momentum that pushes us towards all this technological innovation and towards progress is these weird reward systems that we have. These reward systems are engineered by the universe to ensure that we keep pushing forward and all of the these reward systems are all like going after these primal reward systems that have been inside of us for like hunting and gathering and cold as a reward system that it wants a common cold.

Speaker 1:          01:16:08       Is it, is it. Does it have ambition? Is it going for something? It's just, it's just doing its thing. Yeah, but we know that we're not a cold. We have actual were more complicated, but viruses, computer viruses don't have ambition there. They've just been coded to do something right, but they don't act. They react the. When a computer virus gets into your system, reacts to the fact that it can get in and then it moves forward. If this didn't get in, it just stops. Right. This point here is like the beginning of like an endless argument that you can have because the point is do we act or, or are we just. Well, my point was the computer viruses are programmed to do things. They're programmed to behave in a certain way. They go, they try to go in if they can get past step one to get in the right. I mean that's how a computer virus is set up. We would have to make these computers make these sentient beings. We have to program them with some sort of ambition, some sort of desire to move forward because if you didn't program them with a, with an objective, a mandate, if you didn't, then they would just be intelligent just because they're intelligent. There's no reward system for them to want to make a new nuclear reactor.

Speaker 6:          01:17:19       Again. Man, it's like you're creating a situation where the robots are different than us non-writers thing where it's like they're not an expression of us or an expansion of us. You know, they could be us as they could. They could take what we are. Our brains, for example, which is what is creating all the simulation theory forever. Once they take a human brain scan than neurons in it, ron energy through it and replicated inside a machine will now you have ambition now

Speaker 1:          01:17:51       consciousness. Wow, that's a big leap. I think you have matter. You have organic matter that will move and react. Did the. The idea of consciousness being completely local is a fairly controversial idea. There's a lot of people that don't believe that consciousness even resides in the mind. You know, if you want to get all woo with it, they believe that consciousness is like radio signals in your body is essentially

Speaker 6:          01:18:13       really good antenna. There's no way except to be speculative about this. No, it hasn't happened yet, so why would you? But I would speculate that if you're going to recreate a human mind inside a computer, I would speculate that the thing is going to. If you want to say that there's consciousness that is exteriorized, then I would say that that brain would be an antenna for it in the same way that our brains are.

Speaker 1:          01:18:34       That to me is like saying that if you recreate it, a car would start itself.

Speaker 6:          01:18:39       I don't think it's the same thing because cars never start themselves. Human brains are innately awake. They're innately Sarah.

Speaker 1:          01:18:48       Create an artificial baby and let this baby live life and learn all the things that a person learns to develop a personality or you can have somehow another download. Someone's already formulated 80 year old personality into this, this, this creature.

Speaker 6:          01:19:00       Well, I think that you've got a lot of choices. I mean, it's literally the ideas. If we take the neural pathways of the human brain and replicate them inside a machine, the question that we're coming up against as does the thing is, will the thing think? Will it be

Speaker 1:          01:19:17       well, not only that will will the thing be a person? Will it grow old or does it just exists in the state that you created in? Are you able to create not just a person, but the mechanisms inside of a person, the genetic coding that allows a person to continue to grow and get older and move forward? There's a lot. There's a lot of questions because is it just a meat bag? You know what? If that would be really creepy if we created a person and then just nothing clicked. It's just a meat bag that just dumb as fuck. Meanwhile it's got the most advanced mind ever. We checked the switches, everything's on no desire to move forward, you know, and then we developed a robot woman to suck his Dick and then all of a sudden he's out there huffing. He's got a Ferrari. He got a boat. Hmm.

Speaker 6:          01:20:02       It's an interesting idea. Is an amazing fucking drug and in a definitely no one can argue with the fact that it has been the carrot in front of a lot of people's ambition,

Speaker 1:          01:20:15       washing a lot. Why don't you say all the. The idea of to be loved is in front of almost anything

Speaker 6:          01:20:21       I guess. All. Yeah. I mean I guess I'm just thinking like maybe there's a. I don't know.

Speaker 1:          01:20:25       It is. It is. It. Is it peace. It is a piece. It might not be your entire expression, but it's a piece of your motivation for doing anything. It's to be loved or the love of what you're doing. The love of what you're doing ultimately is a better way of approaching it and you know, and you know, you get love from doing that. Well, and it's a, it's kind of a strange little, uh, it's sort of a strange little exchange. Like if you concentrate too much on, on getting love for what you're doing, then you're not going to do good stuff. You have to concentrate on being loving what you're doing and then when you love what you're doing and really focus on it and then you get love from it. Yeah. It got me the trick. Yeah. Occurs. Sure. Don't you feel like that with comedy?

Speaker 6:          01:21:04       Yes. The moment you get outside of that, you are fucked man. Well, this is that, that's in the, in the Bhagavad Gita. The versus you have a right to your actions and not the fruit of your actions, which means you just focus on what you're doing and don't worry about what's going to flourish on the tree. And then everything works out much better.

Speaker 1:          01:21:20       Well, that sounds like socialism to me, Duncan. And that's what that sounds like. Fucking Bhagavad Gita. Queer, old, shitty fucking writing. What else does it tell you to do?

Speaker 6:          01:21:31       Yeah, I think that it's, um, it's one of the sure ways to destroy yourself is when you start worrying about, um, or you can't. By the way. It's unavoidable.

Speaker 1:          01:21:39       Well, have you ever had a conversation with your agent about how to improve your, your, your response from the audience? Got to give the people what they want. No, thank God. You know, you're going to think like why is pretty cool. Jamie Masada would give the worst fucking advice in the history of the world to comics and number one of them. I mean, look, Jamie's a great guy. He's got a great club, but nobody can tell you what can make you funny. You are, you and Duncan trussell's fund is going to be different than jody is funny going to be different than Brian. Red Bands. Funny. We all got a weird way of looking at things and you gotta figure out your way, but when you get a guy who's not a comic that comes along with like the worst advice ever. Jamie Masada was this one dude. He's like, buddy, you are the generation x guy. That is your thing. Everything you say will say, my generation, I'm generation x and that's your ag. And the guy was like, what the fuck are you talking about man? Fucking generation x guy. If I ever told you about who's opening the door here,

Speaker 6:          01:22:35       if I ever told you about the advice that my first manager gave me. No. So he saw me. This was years and years and you've locked the store. Just the case before creeps. You're walking in. This place is not exactly secure. It was. It was. Brian got up years and years ago I. He saw me with wet hair and he's like, that's what your thing could be. You could be. The guy always gets on stage. What?

Speaker 1:          01:23:01       Oh, that's an awesome piece of advice. Did you think about for a second?

Speaker 6:          01:23:06       Not even for a second. Like what is that even? I guess. I guess what I was thinking like, well I'd probably get electrocuted for one, but what's, what is that? What's the joke? Hey guys, I just got wet.

Speaker 1:          01:23:17       Would you remember when you were doing open mic? Where there were guys who would have like a very specific sort of fucking stick. Yes. They were doing like they would have an outfit.

Speaker 6:          01:23:26       Yes. Yeah, yeah, I've heard of. I heard it. Didn't you hear the tone? You know the story of Jackie? Jackie Banana.

Speaker 1:          01:23:33       Oh, crazy. Bob. You know the story of Jackie Banana. Jackie banana comic, right. Buzz. He didn't he have like a funny act, like a fake act. I heard Mitzi just told him he had to wear a banana, a banana colored suit with a banana peel hanging out. Is he the guy that I'm thinking about this. There's a guy that had like this, uh, like sort of a throwback act, sort of a Vaudevillian sort of a, of a gesture to Vaudeville. Is that the guy? I don't know. It was really like Hacky, but purposely hacky on purpose is that the guy doesn't know. There's a comic. Kind of like that, Neil. I'm not talking about Neil Hamburger. I'm talking about. There was another guy who is from years ago. It was like a skinny, handsome sort of a guy who had this. Is Jackie something or another? I don't know, Jackie diamond, is that, I'm sorry, I can't remember the guy's name, but he had like this. It was pretty funny act, but it was a. It was like, it was like you could have seen him in a, you know, 19 fifties mobster movie. He'd be the guy on stage one of the speakeasies or something.

Speaker 6:          01:24:35       Yeah. Or you know, most comedy way back in the day used to have to have some shtick. It didn't. It wasn't like you could just like go off and weird directions. Comics were very sticky back in the eighties. There were a lot of sticky comics.

Speaker 1:          01:24:47       We'll look at Larry the cable guy. That's his thing. When you ever see the video of him doing his reelect, know him, his real self as Dan. It's really interesting. No, it was a comic and then he just took me totally talks different when he took on this thing and he's a very nice guy. I've only hung out with him once, but he was a very nice guy who's back in the 19 nineties. We did Montreal together and hung out at the comedy works and he sent us some, uh, is a potato chips. He has potato, he listens to the podcast and he sent us some potato chips that taste like hamburgers. Wow. It tastes like cheese mustard. The Burger. It's a trip like you're, you're eating it and you're like, this is so strange. It's like you're getting all these different flavors and then you're like, how quick does this cost cancer? There's no this nothing even remotely natural about that Shit.

Speaker 6:          01:25:42       Dude. You know what I just saw on Reddit that reminds me of is delicious. God Damn. I just on Reddit, fight off the cancer. It's worth it. Take fucking cool ranch Doritos. Someone took coherence Doritos and put it into a salt grinder and the caption was enjoy the rest of your life. Everything. Taste like.

Speaker 4:          01:26:04       That's a great idea. Yeah. It wasn't like a mortar and pestle. Yeah. Do it like alchemy and infinite core ranch flavor on everything. Wow. That would be delicious on chicken or something like that. You know, like if you fried chicken, chicken breast with cool instead of breadcrumbs, you put cool ranch potato chips all over the outside of it would be good on anything. That's so yummy. That sounds really good on a Turd. No, it wouldn't.

Speaker 6:          01:26:34       But man, this thing about stick, this gets into metaphysics and this gets into a place that I think about all the time, which is how much of what human beings day to day that people are doing is just is a stick in the same way that comics have this thing. How many times do you run into someone who's got this thing going on, which is their personality, their ego, this thing that they're clinging to her putting out front that he isn't even them at all.

Speaker 4:          01:26:59       Well, how many people do that in the guise of a radio personality? I mean, isn't that like the ultimate goof? The radio personality? I was listening to Opie and Anthony today and they do a thing called October where they go after hacky radio people and they start talking like them and mocking their act. It's that. It's the Strip club Dj the same. That's the, that's the thing, they go into the, hey ladies, $15. Kamikaze is coming up to the stage. Girls drink for free guy ladies night and then the president. Yeah, very much so. When you speak in front of great groups of people, you must take on a different inflection. We as a nation, you can't just talk to them. This is what I think we need to do. I think this country is crazy. We got to change some shit. What are you saying? You're not presidential.

Speaker 6:          01:27:52       Yeah, you could say the same thing in a normal way and it would seem really fucking weird what my opponent thinks. You know what? My not my opponent just thinks that the taxes are too high and I disagree.

Speaker 4:          01:28:05       It does not concern me. What concerns me is the good will of the American people. What concerns me is the prosperity of the American nation. I just want people to be nicer to each other and make more money. What concerns me is seeing more made in America. Stickers on goods.

Speaker 6:          01:28:23       Yeah. That was that voice, that hypnotic fucking voice, and then we allow it, but keep bringing that down. Like there's personality types, you know, this is where you get into like certain personality types where you'll run into specific groups of people who all act exactly the same. Like goths. People were under certain band. They all act. They all, they all share the similar personality and in colts it's a, a, one of this. One of the aspects of culture is that everyone in the colt kind of acts the same way and the way they're acting like is like the leader, you know. So it gets really interesting when you start considering to yourself how much of what I'm doing is a shtick or how much of what I'm doing is just imitated from someone else, whether it's. My parents were good. Excellent sense. Exactly.

Speaker 1:          01:29:11       We, we inflect on words. You know, I didn't even realize how heavy my Boston accent was until I started seeing myself on television. I saw myself on television when I was 19 after taekwondo tournament. I heard my accent. I was like, oh my God.

Speaker 6:          01:29:23       Oh God, I got to stop that and I've slowly like removed it over the. But you have to hear it. You have to hear it to realize you're even saying it. Yeah, it's fucking crazy man. And, and, and it's just amplitude tutor atmosphere. It's fun to like chase that thing back and to. This is where psychedelics are really useful is because you begin to start contemplating will, who is behind all this? Who's behind the accent? Who's. Do you ever just think, where do my words come from? I think

Speaker 1:          01:29:51       all cool motherfuckers that other people copied, you know, that's where the accent is mean. There must've been one cool motherfucker in Kentucky that just knew how to talk in a way that it just saying bad ass. This mother fucker didn't, didn't give a fuck. You know what I'm saying? He just sat there with a cigarette dangling and have average miles. I don't give a fuck. And everybody in the neighborhood is like, man, I want to be like that dude. Yeah, sure. And they, they all just sort of took on that

Speaker 6:          01:30:16       fluxion. Well remember when a movie would come out when you were an alum. Actually, that's not true. It's not like one guy is not a patient zero when it comes to accents, you know, it's some kind of collaborative collaboration between groups of cool people. Sure. But you know, when a movie would come out and you would be an elementary school and then some catchphrase from that movie would suddenly go rushing through elementary school again. I'm Rick James. Bitch. Yes, yes, exactly. Where it just kind of like a wildfire goes through idiots and they just imitate and imitate and imitate the can't help it. They can't help it. And, and this, this is the big question. This is like, but it's also fun. Oh, it's A. Oh yeah, it's huge. It's human. I mean, God damn everyone's guilty of it, man. James, there's no way to avoid it. I love saying that. No, it's. It seems to be up. There seems to be a prevalence of people saying boo right now. Boom. And also you started some shit, man. You've started powerful, powerful, beautiful. I get powerful tweets. Don't complain about that. You can't worry too much. I'm not complaining about it. Enjoy shit like power. I'm not complaining, but I think it's great, but I'm saying it's interesting to see how certain behavior just micro bay micro behaviors get imitated and echoed throughout society. It's a very interesting.

Speaker 1:          01:31:29       It is fascinating. It is. It is. It's, it's, it's very interesting. It's very interesting that we sort of amalgamate. We've sort of taken from all all sorts of different sources around us that we like all the different things that we like. It's always a problem with comics as well. You know, we see a certain comics that are like just doing Doug Stan hope you know. How many guys have you seen that we're opening for Doug? Have you ever went to one at dog shows, but years ago especially, he would have guys open forum and they were essentially doing stanhope and also Jesus Christ. You got you got you before you, you know, this is ridiculous.

Speaker 7:          01:32:01       It's super common. There was a million have tells for awhile. We're just huge fans of a towel and they couldn't even help it. They started talking

Speaker 6:          01:32:09       day. They just found themselves doing it, you know, you don't even realize it. It's fucking incredible man, and it's like you get thumped printed by a reality in that way and it's goes way back. I mean that's the, that's. I just had my mom is a shrink on the podcast and like she was talking about the effect that she thinks. What happens when you were a kid, like getting your Dick snipped off, like you were saying, has on the rest of your life. It has a huge effect. You get some printed by your parents, by the subjective Dna of your parents, get them printed into you and then you spend the rest of your life in this kind of strange hypnotic trance not knowing why you're doing what you're doing. And that I think is the beginning of, you know, when you're talking about dumb dumb people or people live or absorbed into some religious structure. I think the beginning of human ness starts when you start thinking about, wait, what am I really? What's behind this fucking mask? What's behind the behavior mechanisms that I picked up from my folks are from movies or from influential friends or from whatever. What's the being residing behind all that shit and that I think is when you stop being a machine or start waking up a little bit, but until then you might as well be a fucking brain and it God damn commodore 64.

Speaker 7:          01:33:32       Yeah. Or You just enjoy this fucking weird existence and marvel at all the mystery of it all and just sort of try to take it in and just enjoy it. Because if you, if you try to like get down to your core all day, every day you're going to, you're going to miss what's, what's enjoyable about the experience. I don't necessarily know if we're ever going to figure out what's motivating us, pushing us in one way or another. What? Why do you, why do you talk the way you talk? You know, who are you? But I, but I do love the fact that there's so many variables. I do love a guy like Joey Diaz. I do love how Ra is so much different than Joey. Brian. So much different than me. We're all just weird, you know, personalities that have come about through a whole bunch of different scenarios, a bunch of different ways to live a life, you know, and different locations and different problems and challenges and different genetics. It's a fucking trip, man. The human experience to get to from point a to Duncan trussell at 37 years old is a wild, crazy fuck load and everyone's road is, is unique and different and and creates a different result.

Speaker 6:          01:34:45       Have you heard the term dependent origination? No. It's a Buddhist term and the term is that there is nothing independent. There's nothing independent of it. There's no, no thing that isn't related to some other thing in the universe which creates this kind of tapestry. So makes sense. So the example that you know, of course beer, this beer bottle is not by itself, it comes from sand. It's just what you're seeing here is in the flow of time that a temporary form that a bunch of sand and paper, which comes from trees his congealed into to form this thing, but 700 years from now, this fucking thing is going to be sand again. You said what you're watching right now is just a moment of this thing's true existence and in in in the same way you and Joey Diaz and Brian and me and everyone listening to this, or just one mode, one moment of beingness in this web that for us traces all the way back apparently to nuclear fusion inside of stars, which has gone through infinite time until it's finally manifested in the form of whatever the parts. Yeah, exactly. Which for a moment in time, for a moment in time, that little bit of the tab tonight at 10:30

Speaker 7:          01:36:03       sold out. Bitch. That's cool. Yeah. It's. It's a an amazing connection that we have to everything that's ever existed and we are part of some weird infinite cycle as as the planet, as, as the star that heats the planet. All of these will end. The universe won't, it's this is, but a blip, even the life of a star is, but a blip in the in the life of the universe and they blow up all the time. They said that there was a beautiful show on a hyper novas there were talking about when they first started detecting gamma ray bursts in the galaxy. They didn't know what was going on. They thought it was possible that we were under attack by an alien race because there was a huge burst of energy that were were happening all over the space, all, all, all throughout the universe, so they thought it was possible.

Speaker 7:          01:36:46       They were were actually alien wars at one point in time. That was something that was being considered until they understand the mechanism or understood rather than mechanism. Behind Novus, they're happening all the time. They just. They're just blowing out. There's Mooney and stars. We can't even. Yeah. You gotta go. If in your lifetime to the Keck observatory in Hawaii, if you've never been there, it's one of the, one of the highest observatories and it's above the clouds. It's really wild because you're driving, you drive. It's on the big island and you drive is a long ass drive. It's like a two hour drive up the mountain and as you're driving you hit clouds and you're like, fuck man, we're not going to be able to see shit. We took this big drive up here, but we're not going to able to see shit because was all these clouds.

Speaker 7:          01:37:30       Then you drive past the clouds and you get up there and you go, oh my God. Because first of all, you're at 13,000 feet and second of all there's no light pollution on the island. They have these diffusers on all these lamps, so when you look at you don't even have to look through a telescope. Dude, you just look up when you're at the observatory and you're like, oh my God. The milky ways and staying. Yeah, and it makes you so angry that you can't see that every day. Yeah. Like if we didn't have these greedy ass fucking cities with lights everywhere and driving around with headlights, it would like if we could have just for one hour or couple hours of one day, well maybe just one night a year where everyone shots all the power off for three hours and we all from six to 9:00 PM central. Remember tonight is star appreciation night. We all shut out all the powers in cities.

Speaker 2:          01:38:27       Yeah, they, they've tried that a few times where I'll look it up. Oh yeah. Good. Good idea.

Speaker 7:          01:38:33       See I'm behind the times somebody thought it up, but if we did that and you, you, you could see that we would have so many people that would be so much more in awe of space and so much more interested in the. And especially children interested in the idea of pursuing astronomy or are pursuing rocketry or working for NASA or something. I mean, just the, our appreciation for, you know, funding things like NASA and the Hubble telescope and new telescopes and you know, the Keck observatory and all these, you know, all that stuff would be so much more appreciated if we could see the majesty of the stars. We've robbed ourselves from that, of that with cities, the, the, the light. We don't even realize it because we've grown up with these things, but all that light all the time has robbed us of really the most amazing thing you could ever see.

Speaker 7:          01:39:23       And one of the most humbling things I've ever seen in my life. I've had psychedelic experiences that didn't affect me as much as looking at those stars because I, I remember that night I couldn't sleep. I remember I got back to the hotel room. I was just lying in bed staring up at the ceiling, thinking how insane that thing was and that that's up there all the time that I can't see it. And it really hit home. The feeling that was when I really started pushing the idea of the planet as an organic spaceship. That's when I really started talking about it. That's when I came up with that whole bit about, you know, explaining the, you know, the war on Iraq, hurling through the universal, how insane it is to pay attention to the Grand Canyon. You know, that that bit it was like, there's people out there look deep at Grand Canyon. Meanwhile, above you is infinity.

Speaker 2:          01:40:08       Did you see the Graham Hancock video that he posted on his information website of the sound of the Earth space? Did I got the dolphins do.

Speaker 7:          01:40:18       It's the radio waves radio waves that the, uh, the radiation belts.

Speaker 2:          01:40:24       Yeah. Yeah. But it sounds a lot. Sounds like, sounds like dolphins. It sounds like chirping Wales Brion. Pull that up because it's fucking trippy. Are you drinking a rockstar? You fucking Rockstar? Yeah. By the way, it was, it's called a earth hour. It's actually one hour a year that everyone's supposed to do. I just turn off all their power except for the refrigerator for an hour. Really? Yeah. That's. La doesn't do that shit. Fuck you gotta do coke. What was the shit you want me to look at? Seven Hancock site.

Speaker 6:          01:40:54       He's got this newsletter. I don't know the exact,

Speaker 1:          01:40:55       it's just I'm just look up scientists find the sound of the earth.

Speaker 6:          01:41:01       Yeah. It'll pop up right away. It sounds like Chirping Josh or Wales. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:41:07       Yeah, and it's a apparently the sound of the radio show, the radiation belts and make a sound that's like it wavers.

Speaker 12:         01:41:17       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:41:21       Yeah. We're weird, man. I think it's just a matter of time before we. We get contacted by something that's more intelligent than us. I've been thinking that more and more lately. I think if there is something out there that's more intelligent than than than human beings, it's going to have to contact us really soon because we're like real

Speaker 6:          01:41:44       close. Well, this is the thing, man. This is. I can't remember if fucking said that's one of the singularity people said humankind's first contact with an extraterrestrial or with rather an alien intelligence is going to be a machine that's woken up and that's going to be our first experience with it is something we made

Speaker 1:          01:42:05       instead of instead of a thing from space. Well, it's possible. It's possible.

Speaker 1:          01:42:11       It is possible that we're at the height. I mean, there was one, a recent Harvard astronomer that decided after looking at 500 different stars that we may be the only thing out there and that there's so little a life or evidence of life in these. These planets is 500 different planets rather than they've observed, but I think that's ridiculous. The most ridiculous because he is coming from a planet that has life. That's one of those 500. So it's not that there's nothing in 500. No. You found one dummy and you're on it. There's one and you found $500 that don't. But you find one that does. Okay. You have to add that in stupid. You don't just go looking for another one and if the other one you can't find it. Well they don't exist. Meanwhile you are one that doesn't make any sense.

Speaker 6:          01:42:58       And also man, that creek bed and Mars, that shit gives me goosebumps when I see pictures of the fucking gravel and Mars from water flowing on Mars. I just think about what that must have looked like on that planet with Martian water rolling through whatever it was rolling through. I think there was probably life on Mars.

Speaker 1:          01:43:18       Yeah. Brian, pull up how earth sounds from space on youtube and uh, and it's, it will freak you. It's fucking loud ass people interfering with our podcast yelling in the street. But we got. We got no sound proofing here at the icehouse. How earth our earth sounds from space. It's on youtube. It's so it shows up the earth itself. You see like cloud formations and shit.

Speaker 1:          01:43:49       No, that's not the one. That's not the most recent one. Let me see. Let me look up Graham Hancock.com. How was that movie you saw last night? Joe? Fucking awesome. What is this? A looper oh good. I'm glad. That's good. Oh my God. Is it good? It's not just good. It's like one of the best movies I think I've ever seen. It was a really good fucking moving. I can't find the sound man. I don't know where it is. Anyway, go find it folks. It's on my twitter. Why don't I just look on my own fucking twitter. Stupid ass. I'm so dumb. I'm

Speaker 4:          01:44:25       the, uh, the looper movies. Really fucking good. It's really good. Writing, you know, I didn't know anything about it. Which one of those mind benders where your brain feels like it's getting stretched out because it's so. No, you know, it wasn't. That was the thing they managed to,

Speaker 1:          01:44:40       to avoid. They managed to avoid all sorts of. You go to my um, my twitter. Brian, I found it. If you pull up a, there's a

Speaker 4:          01:44:50       tweet I retweeted a gentleman named Aaron Rodriguez. Aaron Rodriguez. Congratulations. You were the guy who gets mentioned on a podcast, Aaron Rodriguez and it says apparently the van Allen Radiation Belt sings like a whale. Nothing to fear guys. And it's a 22 hours. Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:45:06       I retweeted it. So find that Sun Sun. Um, what was I saying

Speaker 4:          01:45:13       you were talking about. I don't know what you're talking about before that man fucking lost me. There it is. Yeah. That's a planet.

Speaker 13:         01:45:29       That's so creepy. Sounds like it's calling a dog. You know what it's calling other planets saying this place is filled with a bunch of crickets and cons with nuclear bombs. Don't fuck with it.

Speaker 4:          01:45:45       Is the end of it. I don't think that fucking thing. That thing does not sound that. That does not sound like a defenseless thing. To me. That sounds like a thing that could just jump out of the woods and bite your head off. Well, that's not a real sound. You know, it's radio waves, so we've sort of interpreted them as a sound as I understand it. I don't think it's actually that you stuck your head out of the space shuttle. You wouldn't hear that. Yeah. To get wiped off. Yeah. You probably would hear that accent. Yeah. You wouldn't hear shit. Your head would freeze instantly. Isn't that crazy that you would just freeze instantly in space? Yeah. You just couldn't live.

Speaker 14:         01:46:23       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:46:24       Is there someone at the door? Who is it?

Speaker 4:          01:46:27       Who is.

Speaker 1:          01:46:29       Who's motherfuckers keep interrupting. I think what I think is our show, a comedy show starts in 30 minutes, so it's probably comics, but comics or would just come back here and not say anything. Hold on. Woo Dunkin.

Speaker 4:          01:46:44       Yes. Brian, how are you doing? Where are you? Where are you at next? Where are you going out town? I'm going to Vancouver this weekend. Oh, lucky people are playing at that hotel comedy club. What's it called again? The comedy Max.

Speaker 1:          01:46:56       Oh, that's awesome. I knew it was because joe is a type of guy that just tries doors. He doesn't knock doors unlocked house. They stealthy keep it on the download cock sucker.

Speaker 4:          01:47:10       So this. It's an audio rendering of radio waves. That's what it is. Captured by probes. Still fucking weird.

Speaker 1:          01:47:22       Lock that door to keep out the stockers or something going on, buddy. Know Me. Dog hit on me. Keeping a beautiful. Did you lock it up man?

Speaker 4:          01:47:37       We're here for another soul down show tonight at the Ice House in Pasadena. Ladies and Gentlemen, will we sling comedy Dick on a regular basis and you know, we got a lot of people come back so we could try to come up with as much new shit as possible. And uh, I'm going to be doing a lot on the earth thing and like a whale. That's my new barrier. No, I don't think there's any material doing a whole chunk on snm tonight. Are you really? I can't wait to hear it better. Not use any of my stories. You fuck what? As an m story do you? I know I got all those fucking things.

Speaker 4:          01:48:11       You have no ball gag stories and that's a shame. No, I operate on a different level of you. I don't know if I don't have the right level. I'm not saying it is, but it just saying it's different labs, different level. You're into your insistence. Shit. Let's say on occasion. I'm not just some shit that makes me uncomfortable as a man. Afraid to experiment by what he's. He's judging me because I'm tying to all gag into a lady and you diaper never did that. You made that up. No judge you Duncan. I would never judge you. You. I love you exactly the way you are. I don't want you to change even slightly, but the ball gag thing bothers me. Bothers me. It's totally normal. Like the first time I'm like, well, I'm still intrigued by this ball. Gag Business. Let me try it again. Joey, sit in with us, man. What are you doing?

Speaker 1:          01:49:10       You what? Okay. Okay. See, I'm gonna Joey Diaz. Ladies, gentlemen in and out. He's here. He's gone. He's here for

Speaker 4:          01:49:19       a sold out show, the Basil Dino, welcome to my radio voice duty to do so. Opie Anthony attack these guys on what they called Shocktober. They do it every year apparently. Fucking so funny because it was opie and Anthony. It was um, who else was on Tom? Papa was in there. I'm just saying. I don't know. It was just, you know, the show is always like a bunch of people like all in together

Speaker 1:          01:49:48       and it was really fucking funny. And then within a half an hour, an hour of them doing it, the radio station took to their facebook page because the ONA savages had started attacking the facebook page and shitting all over it, bananas and sell them. They're all drowned in a. it's just so funny. Oh, I mean, I just, I just fucking love that. They're so sensitive. They took it on their facebook page. Look, this is what happened. You got, you got goofed on. You should have been moved on a long time ago and then you would have never done that radio voice.

Speaker 2:          01:50:24       I think they train in that voice. I think that that there's schools where people trained to talk like that and you just choose like strip club or or radio voice or whether person

Speaker 1:          01:50:35       it was saying anthony was saying that they made them. It was anthony or opening. I forget. I think they're all talking about how the guy actually said, I want you to visualize who your audience is. Just, you know, take a picture out of a magazine that represents that guy. You know, you're a blue collar guy and just put that up there on the wall and you know, that's the guy you're talking to. That's your guy. You know what Anthony was saying that he put up John Casey. It was fucking funny, but it's like that. That happens whenever you get a producer involved in, in someone who's in a non creative person involved in trying to shape your radio personality. Look, gonna do man is just tighten up your image. You need a thumb ring and you thought about a new nose rings. Yeah man. Thumb rings to Anthony Bourdain is the only guy that I've ever met that used to wear a thumb ring. This douche bag. Cool guy and he has a thumb ring and I'd watch them on the show and I'm like, man, I just kind of talked to them about that ring. We're going to be fine or toe rings.

Speaker 2:          01:51:46       Get the fuck Outta here. And the tattoo around the belly button. That's another one. Just get bored. I can see tattoo on your belly button. That's just a board issue but not a toe ring. Did you see that shit on Reddit? The guy who had it rem job tattooed on his face like right on his mouth, on his mustache. Really, it's the saddest thing. It looks like he's been crying like him and some other guy. They're both obviously fucked up and one of them as some shit tattoo on his forehead, but the other guys, right

Speaker 1:          01:52:14       rim job. I think there's a lot of people that just incredibly self destructive. What is that? Is that. Is that like us losing our natural reward system with hunter and gathering and being stuck into some weird fucking environment. We're taking pills and trying to overcome reality with pharmaceutical drugs and sedate our sell through shit jobs and boring, meaningless existences as a cog in the wheel and then you just go crazy substance abuse,

Speaker 2:          01:52:41       see your face. They. It's like the human version of pigs in slaughterhouses that start chewing off their own legs because they're too close to each other. You just end up going into some, but also a lot of times when people do that shit outside of the guy who did rim job, a lot of times when people fuck up their body, they're doing it because they want specific types of girls to like them. I think. I think that they're writing rim job when you're not that I said except for that guy, but like the people who like just fucking like putting the hang themselves from their nipples are like people who do the earrings, the big ear holes. If you stand there looking for certain types of girls. I think that's what it is. I think it's amazing pattern. Some of it for sure it hits the ear thing is.

Speaker 2:          01:53:21       I would have never saw that coming me either. I met a lot of cool people that have it too and I don't want to judge them. I don't want to judge them, but that's a fucking a trippy thing. You gotTa fucking toilet paper roll in your ear, son. Did you see that prank or maybe it was just. It was an idea for a prank. It's awful, but it's like you sneak up on one of those guys with a lock and put it in the ear hole and lock it so they've got a lock like locked into their ear. I think I saw a video of it or someone suggesting someone do that. Brutal. That's horrific because then you'd have to get it clipped. That's terrific. It's a dangerous thing, man. It's not a strategic thing to have giant holes in your ears. It's dangerous. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          01:54:01       What if. What if you ripped it off and then beat the guy to death with it? Yeah. You do that too. Well, you would deserve it. Probably. It's a shitty move. Yeah. Locking someone, putting a lock in someone's fucking hear. You better know that combination. Bitch. That's a rude prank. It's not, I guess pranks, the wrong word. It's an assault and attack, but yeah, all that shit. Body modification, that thing where uh, people in Korea, is it Korea that they're putting up donuts in their heads, head bagels. What's going on? It's like we're sick of our bodies or something, man. We're taking these strange paths to make our bodies look different. It's really fucking weird. And The lady just grew an ear off or arm, but that wasn't cosmetic. That's because she had to. She had cancer. Yeah. That's not related, but yeah, there is a lot of weird shit that people do. But I say that, but then I have two sleeves of tattoos. You know, two arms are covered in drawing. Yeah, right. But still again talk. No, I think two sleeves of tattoos is a fuck load cooler than having your head and flavor. Yeah, it's cooler, but it's still weird to, you know, the average person doesn't want to sit there and have someone drawn them with a fucking scratching needle shows inc under their skin. Just to make it look cool. I want a fucking tattoo.

Speaker 2:          01:55:15       What'd you get? I don't know. That's the problem, man. It's torture me for my whole life. I'm always thinking about what it would be and I don't know. I'm hoping that when I, when I go out to Brazil and slurp back some Iowasca, it'll come to me. I think it was just a little nervous, a little sweet face on your arm. Little Hobo with a giant Dick like evil boy that has tattooed on from a dmt word. Huge Dick. But little hobos face. No, no, I don't like that Tattoo. I was going to any

Speaker 1:          01:55:44       big veiny giants like that Tattoo. How about a black dude? Nope. Dick to represent the American Indian being speaking my language now. It means big, hard red deck like the hawk. If he was red, now you feel me on this? Nothing. Damn. It goes on a good path. What would you. What about some of the from the Bhagavad Gita as or like a,

Speaker 6:          01:56:09       but again, like that should all seem so fucking like contrived, you know, it seems because like, I don't, I'm not, I'm not going to like look at my arm. You're like, no. How about Alistair Crowley? On your shoulder that man, I haven't. Alistair Crawley poster and shit falls off my walls. I don't want my body some, some goddamn chaos. There's chaos. Magician named freighter is low if he doesn't care. I said his name, who mails me like really weird. Oh, a cult shit man. Like really strange. Like um, he just sent me a demon, a demon summoning box where he's painted the front of it. It sounds really dumb when I came in. So many books. There's a anyway, there's a lot of weird. There's a lot of strange shit out there man. But the point is I would never want curly tattooed on my body.

Speaker 1:          01:57:03       There's a lot of people that have terence Mckenna tattooed on them for the interesting.

Speaker 6:          01:57:06       I think that's pretty good, but I don't know man. I like more of a, something that's less specific, you know, something that may be as

Speaker 1:          01:57:14       the Terence Mckenna Tattoo going to be real problematic if December 20, first 2012 rolls over another that happens. Although he wasn't really convinced that anything

Speaker 6:          01:57:23       was going to happen. Well everyone's Scott. That. I mean there's a simple out for 2012, which is that it's a shift in the vibration.

Speaker 1:          01:57:32       Well, no one's ever predicted anything ever. That's my problem with it. No one's ever correctly predicted any like huge change in the world ever. No one's ever said on this day to specifically to the day the world will. The world will change forever. They tried with y two k? Yes. Oh God. That was crazy. I wonder if they traveled with. I wonder if people thought 1984 was going to be a big year because of the book. Man. I remember. Do you remember? I don't remember that. Well, 1984 is like nothing compared to what's really going on right now. And your fucking phone is a wireless gps tracker that they can turn on and listened to you and record you talking anymore. You are? Yeah. That shit. We are so primitive back then, man. Your phone plug into the wall. Well, it's really interesting when you go back to like the 18 hundreds, you know, like when was the war of the worlds weren't written.

Speaker 1:          01:58:34       I believe it was written in the 18 hundreds, right? Came on the radio. People start radios. Teen Twenties or thirties of the word. I'll say 19. Twenty three. One was went home. Boy did it on the radio. Orson wells. What year was that? It was hg wells. Eighteen 98. Oh Damn. Yeah. And then uh, Orson Welles did it. I think in the 19. The early 19 hundreds. Hey, powerful. Ian Edwards is here. Ladies. Gentlemen, what's up brother? See Him as a man. How you doing? Come on in target. I'm comics started shuffling lays gentleman, which means which we will. We're going to shift from this to that. Yeah. Let's share the shift from the Duncan trussell family hour podcast explosion in your mouth to a nice house chronicles. So that sounds good, Brian. Oh, I don't know what you're doing that. Do you want to do one? Not really. Don't have to. Okay, then we won't do it. All right folks. No more fucking podcast. Well, we got. Well it's not even 10:00 though, Dude. Let's keep going then. If we're not going to do a nice house chronicle. So let's keep going because it's only, it's only a quarter to 10 shows at 10:30, but to have a sold out show here tonight at the Ice House, Ian Edwards, ready to get your freak on.

Speaker 6:          01:59:47       What do you, what about this, this shit with, uh, the dispensary's now that it got overturned, what happened?

Speaker 1:          01:59:55       I think they decided to let them keep continuing to operate because they need the tax revenue. It would be catastrophic to a lot of these neighborhoods if all of a sudden those businesses pulled out. What people don't understand is that this, these businesses, these cannabis dispensaries have become a big part of the economic success of a lot of communities mean not only do people work there and have jobs and get paid, but they also pay rental landlords. I mean, there's a lot of them. There's hundreds of them that would mean that hundreds of places no longer have someone renting them. And it's not like there's a shortage of, uh, of, of, of places to rent. There's a lot of places to rent. So if you, you know, it's like commercial real estate. Like I had a look around at a lot of commercial places to get a podcast studio, looked at a lot of office space and stuff like that. It's fucking everywhere. Everywhere. It's so many places are available and open and if they decided just randomly to shut down 700 different fucking dispensary's for just dubious reasons. For reasons that don't make any sense at all, it would be. It would. It would suck. It would fuck up. The economy is a lot of money that goes to paying taxes.

Speaker 6:          02:01:03       Joe, is it. Was that. I also read that the IDA was saying that they're gonna stop rating medicinal marijuana dispensary.

Speaker 1:          02:01:10       No, I didn't read that. When did they say that? See someone.

Speaker 6:          02:01:12       I don't know if it's true. I think it might have. It might be with

Speaker 1:          02:01:16       you. Probably would because one of the things that I read is that the dea, they won't disclose any information about bus and what they're doing is they're going in and rating people. They're taking all the marijuana, they're taking their money, taking their plants. They confiscate all the records. They write down everyone's name and then they do nothing and they don't have to do anything and when you try to find information in the case, they just say an ongoing investigation and they don't do anything, so there's been a or doing something but they ain't really doing nothing. They're coming in and jacking people and not arresting anybody. And Todd Mccormick was the first person who told me about this and I was like, that doesn't even make sense. I was like, am I missing something in the story? And then I went and looked at it online, but no, that is the practice. The practice is they just make it ridiculous for these people to try to run a business and they'd come in and take all their shit.

Speaker 15:         02:02:01       Like trying to act like they're doing something to kind of keep the show going that they're doing their job but they don't really want to arrest. They probably agree with the states that have California that have weed laws, but there's like, all right, we got to do something so let's just shut this down. But not really try people.

Speaker 1:          02:02:22       I don't know if it's an agreement thing because a lot of cops do not like weed. You know what I mean? When when cops break into guys' houses and shoot their dog 17 fucking times and look around and find a pipe, a little bit of weed on it. Have you seen some of those videos and the links? I can't. Trendous man. They shot some former marine 17 times the other day and they thought this guy had pot him. He had nothing. It's the whole thing is crazy. I thought he was a dealer. There's no pot in the house.

Speaker 15:         02:02:46       When are you going to put some of these cops away just to let other cops know. It's always like, let's not rush to judgment that police chief is like, let's not rush to judgment. Let's see what happens. But they rushed to judgment when the cops right up a criminal forum and somebody that they arrest and they put the story on the news, like instantly that person's guilty, but when a cop shoots somebody lists this weight.

Speaker 1:          02:03:09       Well, sometimes they do that, but you know, the Internet is sort of taking a lot of that away. They're exposing these people like that. That officer at Uc Davis, that's pepper sprayed those kids in the face and then there was a recent situation where the cop cold cocked a chick at a Puerto Rican day, pride for it and he thought that she did something, but she didn't. She just was in the wrong place, the wrong time. So he turns around and cracks her. It was fucked up, man. It's fucked up to watch that guy's in trouble. That guy's in trouble be. Yeah, he fucking shed vein. Even if she did throw water on them, you're not allowed to punch her. Dude. You're a cop. Girl throws water. You can't punch her in the face. A little more restricted. The cool thing about the proliferation of fucking cameras everywhere, like it goes both ways, but I've heard that the TSA is not letting you film them anymore. If you heard this. I've heard that. Yeah. Yeah. That's when we had a WHO's telling us a story? Kevin Prayer was telling us the story of being stuck at the airport and trying to film and his girlfriend trying to film it and they wouldn't let him.

Speaker 1:          02:04:10       They took him into a room and it's like, I don't have a witness here anymore. At least out there. I have a witness like I want to film this. They wouldn't let him. They wouldn't let him. The whole thing is, it's just ridiculous.

Speaker 15:         02:04:21       Solaris the TSA. I can like cops now.

Speaker 1:          02:04:24       Police State, Ladies and gentlemen, we've reached a police state. People want to control people. The system sucks. The systems a mass. People are complaining and then they want to control the people complaining so they want to tighten down a police state instead of addressing what the people are complaining about when people to the point where they're rioting in the streets or there's an occupy Wall Street type of movement. Man. The fact that the government does not address that on a formal basis, on a regular basis, that they're not doing something about that and adjusting. It just shows you how, how much content they have for the actual people and who they really work for. That's not even a subject of a guarantee that shit's going to come up in the debates. You think they're going to talk about occupy Wall Street and addressing their demands

Speaker 2:          02:05:02       or the petro dollar or the or the fact that China is like apparently switching away from the dollar to buy oil. Have you heard about that shit? No, I don't blame him. If they're seen the value of the dollar. Jesus doesn't even meet. This spooky thing is apparently our entire currency is based on the fact that most people use it to buy oil and so they have to have vast reserves of it on hand to buy the oil, but if that changes, then our dollar will drop even more than it's valued at now and the most extreme way because it's not based on gold until a lot of people. It's called the petro dollar theory. It's on wikipedia. It's a theory, but the theory is that all the wars that we've been in have been with places that we're about to switch the currency from the dollar to something else, and whenever that happens we go in and attack because that's the only thing that our dollars valued on. But it's a theory. It's a conspiracy about while we attacked Iraq. Yes, and right after we had, because he had already switched over and we attacked Iraq and then we turned it back to the dollar. Within a year of attacking. Yeah. Little while you'll hear them talk about that in the fucking debates. You won't hear that come up. Well, you won't hear them talking about Wiki leaks. So there was a purpose to all these wars. That's good to know that they're not doing it for nothing. That's good money, son.

Speaker 1:          02:06:23       You're not going to hear anybody talking about Wiki leaks and the debate and that shit ain't going to sweep that under the rug.

Speaker 2:          02:06:30       Is that dude still hold up in that has been there for months to get him any pussy. You should. They should sneak him in some hippie plus. You have to pay rent there. It's a good question. I wonder if he's got a dope suite too. He just promises not to leak anything about them. Yeah. I wonder if he has to promise. Oh Shit. He probably has some serious shit on that guy. Well, it's weird that

Speaker 1:          02:06:51       they're in there in England, but it's the Ecuadorian embassy, so he's allowed to stay. Even though he's in England, they all just stand around waiting for him to come out. So he stays in that house for months. He's been in that house for months

Speaker 2:          02:07:02       now. He comes out and does little speeches from that balcony, but he's still in the house. Technically I was calling him Ray Ponzel rape rape. Well they, they, uh, they already got that.

Speaker 1:          02:07:18       The DNA test back on the condom and it shows none of his deal.

Speaker 2:          02:07:21       Yeah. I don't think, you know, they just want to get. I'm sorry Julian. I love you. Yeah, they're jacking that guy. It's really scary, isn't it? Yeah. It's fucking scary. And also that other guy that's in just in some pod somewhere getting hose 24 hours a day, they have him in solitary confinement. He's naked. He's not allowed to wear clothes. He just like balled up in a fetal position in some orange room. Getting sprayed with water. I was is every few hours. Music? Yeah. Is that what you heard? I made up a lot of that when I went to visit him. That's how it was after I fucked up. But he's not doing great. I don't think he can send letters and stuff.

Speaker 1:          02:08:01       I don't think you can do anything enough letters, you know, saying essentially psychologically torturing.

Speaker 2:          02:08:07       He's gone. I bet he's gone. When he comes out of there, he's going to be a drooling boo Radley. You won't know. That's optimistic

Speaker 1:          02:08:12       when it comes out of they're never coming out. Coming out. And what. You know, what's really interesting is this guy could have done something far worse and he would be in a real prison, was interacting with people. He could have been a murderer, he could've been the DC sniper. He could've been. He could've done something far more horrific and he would be interacting with people with this guy did was leaked some information about some shit that he thought was horrific and in doing so they're treating him like he is fucking Lex Luthor to treating him like he's the worst bad guy ever. I. While Manson's and a regular prison somewhere,

Speaker 2:          02:08:47       Rogan. Have you seen this list that leaked about that? Different signs that someone's a terrorist like at week from the army or something like what to look for? What was one of them? Everything you do like you like you are. There's, there's, there's gradients on the list and on the red side it's pretty much all of us. All of us are like, would be considered like terrorists by this new thing. Did you find it?

Speaker 1:          02:09:13       Oh, if you use social media. Yeah, I read some. I read some of it back in the day. This podcast would probably be considered like communists the mccarthy era or you know, just just some red party shit for sure. Wow. Here's some warning signs. According to the U, s military. Wow. You've recently changed your choices in entertainment. You have peculiar discussions have gone to a blowjob porn. You complain about bias to your socially withdrawn. Jody is jody, is that on? I don't hear him check their beautiful. Um, uh, you're socially withdrawn. You're frustrated with mainstream ideologies. Your risk factors for radicalization include social networks and youth being young on facebook because it, you're a young urine terrorist. That is fucking hilarious. That is just like the most broad sweeping brush I think I've ever read ever in an official

Speaker 2:          02:10:22       think came out with this. This is some cons. I know. I think it's like the army and, and, but the combination of this with the indefinite detention act, that's where shit gets creepy because it's one thing to just be like, yeah, those are

Speaker 6:          02:10:33       signs that someone might be doing something weird, but then I think a terrorist, someone suspected of terrorism can just get arrested according to the indefinite detention act without a trial. So that's where she gets a little not, not going to sleep that well at night.

Speaker 1:          02:10:48       Well, we have this girl who's coming on the podcast tomorrow, Amber Lyon, who was working for CNN and was like clearly censored, like they were told not to tell stories. There are certain things that were told not to cover. There's certain areas where they wanted to. They wanted to report on actual news and they were told not to and they were told to read off government propaganda that they knew was not true. Yeah. And this is on CNN, so you know, it's, it's, it's real. It's on it. It's not like. It's not like people going, oh yeah, well they wouldn't act on that stuff. No, no, no, no, no, no, no. This is like, like they've figured out a way to control media and propaganda is a real thing. Now it's 100 percent real. They can big and lie to you all day long

Speaker 6:          02:11:37       and if you want to travel anywhere, they can restrict you. They not only can they restrict you, but just to travel. You are going to have your body magnetically scans so they can see you fucking naked. If you travel, you must allow them to see your name.

Speaker 16:         02:11:52       Goodbye. That doesn't work. As Joey Diaz clearly explained

Speaker 1:          02:11:56       on the Alex Jones show, they missed a bag of weed, has hidden under

Speaker 16:         02:12:00       balls. It can't see through Joey's balls. They might be able to see distant telescope. They have not yet developed a scanner machine that could see past better. Watch that al Qaeda is going to cut your. To smuggle something to another country. You have to buy Joe's Joe DSS, sack skin. What they need to do is this scientist that clone Dolly the sheep. They need to clone Joey's balls. Just make them really large extent. No coffee grounds. Put them over stealth bombers and you can just fucking flying in the x ray machines wouldn't see shit. We get you these x Ray. They put that fucking umpire thing on your chest. That's what my skin on my nuts through. It's like fucking shield. It doesn't go through because I hide that. Sat behind them was all they could see is this motherfucker got three nuts. He's the luckiest motherfucker.

Speaker 16:         02:12:49       They don't want to gonna overlook the morals. They robbed the $800,000 worth of loot to TSA people. Yeah. They found the IPAD. Did you see that? But they robbing those motherfuckers dog. Yeah, they definitely have the. They're always like swiping watches and shit. You got to hear a lot of stories, but I went through the tsa today and they were being extra careful because like a penny dropped off into the and they're like, sir, your penny. Don't forget your pen. You're probably gonna. Feel guilty. Everybody's watching. Everyone's watching you. Just saying this is a metal washer.

Speaker 1:          02:13:26       Just watching the men in the metal, but it doesn't go off.

Speaker 16:         02:13:29       Go right through the scanner machine. It goes, what? You fucking. Wouldn't it be hilarious? They're not even checking you. Definitely. Would that be crazy? Would that be if half those machines, it really cost like $800 rich body go through and they just make you go through and press a button and go. You're going through it and just checking to see, look how many fucking times they find people with bullets and guns and fucking stupidity. It makes you really think it really makes you fucking think. I guarantee avenues people just whatever, just whatever. You know today's a data free fucking day. You might want a bazooka. We're not going to catch you. Well, they did some independent testing where they tried to get people through and they got through with a bunch of guys. You'd be fucking surprised. You'd be fucking surprised. Well No, it goes off a foil from Gum, Huh? Yeah. When you have like a pack of Dentine with a push through foil back. That shit go. You have that in your pocket. You'll beat, but you've got a weapon. But meanwhile the metal that you're watches made out for whatever fucking reason, that doesn't go off. It just makes me want to puke when I look over and see a fucking old man today. I saw an 80 year old man with a brace on his neck getting like a hard core. You know what? Come on. He was he white. He probably did.

Speaker 17:         02:14:43       Did some shit back in the creepy shit. Fuck it up to be alive. Did some racist shit. Needs to go search.

Speaker 16:         02:14:53       Say workers were working them over like a water hose. Help they dip their fingers inside. Sanitizers stuck it right up his ass. He had Sam took John Sanitizer, hand sanitizer inside your ass. That would not be cutting your asshole. Yeah, someone's done it. Someone does it all day. Someone's probably addicted to doing that. Going to a doctor. I've got to stop putting her hand sanitizer up my ass and is actually a new thing. A new fucking. Remember we went to town and we had dinner with some doctor. I was there. It's telling us about emergency room share. A friend of mine used to all that. They in Chicago national that they buried the fucking God member. What were the stories about Josh motherfuck? You're John Rollo. Tell you about his buddy. The boxer who went for shoulder surgery and before you have shoulder surgery, they shoot a, uh, a thing in you and it and it fucking freezes your arm.

Speaker 16:         02:15:49       Your nerves. You can have your nerves like 18 months. They shot the motherfucking the wrong arm. Oh No. Yeah. Boxer as John Rollo. He picked somebody, Andre Ward to a decision or something like that a couple of years ago. And then they did the surgery. They shot this motherfucker in the wrong order, but it takes 18 months to heal because I guess it's one centimeter of fucking month that heels backwards. John was telling me, Oh, can you man? They go in for surgery to take out your wrong. Fuck. I boss, boss ruin has a nerve issue that he had a nerves fucked up and it was over a year where his arm hadn't healed yet. Something we. Your nerves take time, dude. I've heard of people bringing their dogs into the vet to get him groomed and they put them to sleep because of confusion. They get it confused. Yeah. Will Ferrell's tats. Oh Shit.

Speaker 16:         02:16:38       That's a call back from an old Joe Rogan podcast. Will Ferrell. Is Cats feral cats. Oh, remember that going back to the ems, a friend of mine out there, he was a comic and use will be, you know, used to work in the ambulance and Queens and uh, like people would come in with shit stuck in they ass. Like one guy had that Gi joe doll. It was, he was talking about people getting stood up. Graham, Steve Graham always talks about that when he did his residency in Miami, said they found light bulbs up people's assets. Those those twisty light bulbs or the twisty joints have led light bulbs up their assets and then the light bulb broke some of the thing. He said, well, this dude's stuck. A Gi Joe. Joe Doll up his ass, but he couldn't pull it out because the arms opened up.

Speaker 16:         02:17:24       That's when you have to call the bar. And he was like, Hook Dude. This guy, the doctor, we were talking at two at dinner. He said something that I'd never heard before, which is some people were taking nitrous oxide, remember this and inflating their testicles with it and that some people do that. A guy like, you know where you can get this nitrous oxide dude, I have no idea, but if you get it from dunkins testicles that lets it out and whistles. Like I heard of a chicken Jersey one time while he was in the hospital, some chick came in, she put a frozen a hotdog and they'll push it up broke so she had to go get it.

Speaker 17:         02:18:09       Oh, she was so cold, like a fucking ballpark. She's such a bitch. That shit didn't even fuck up. Go fuck him.

Speaker 16:         02:18:28       Crushed it came out the snow

Speaker 17:         02:18:33       icicle.

Speaker 16:         02:18:38       I mean if you can think of it, someone stuffed it up there. I just call a dude, right? Someone is someone stuffed ticket name for a kid's book. These microphones stands. Someone's shoved up their ass, right? Someone's shoved beer bottles up the Ras. We've also two guys, one cup or see that the guy stuck or gummies. Jara possess. You just see that. Oh, he pushed. Stuck like a, like a, like one of those jars. We get some really good jelly, you know, you get that preserved. Whereas like a fancy fancy glass jar like I had that deepen his ass and it broke and then clunks have chunks of broken glass and blood or coming out of his ass. I mean it is a crazy fucking. See what about those junkies in prison? They walk around with a syringe in there, a fucking syringe with a spoon batches and want they tuck

Speaker 1:          02:19:28       it in their asshole store syringes. In your end, after 10 years of doing it, it just like nothing open your ass old tickets needle out of that. Oh my God. It's not the way they say that. A lot of guys get hepatitis from exchanging needles if they don't have clean needles. It's fucked up though. There's diseases that come just from sex, like how did syphilis ever get, you know, we know we were talking about like swine flu and all these different things that come from from massive farms, which is a lot. A lot of fluids come from fucking sexually transmitted diseases come from who? Who's the first person to get herpes? Like how did, how did that get Kelly cursed

Speaker 1:          02:20:13       syphilis, syphilis, syphilis. Now what is syphilis? How does it get into what comes out of your Dick? What comes up? What leakage? When I was about 15, my buddy told me I had a problem. He goes, can you go to the clinic with me? Hello Boo. Forget going to the clinic afterschool. Not even thinking about it guys and see them bitches with sores in their mouth and fucking shit leak. And I was like, I made a mental note right there, like right there. I was like, I ain't fucking around with bitches til I'm older. Well, this is the. One of the things that they, they shut down the porn industry because the dude syphilis and started giving the. Yeah, this is a during 2010, there was for 45,834 new cases of syphilis compared to 48,000. Um, uh, HIV infections and 300, 9,000 cases of gonorrhea. Whoa. Gary is popular. Which ones? Three hundred and 9,000 cases of gonorrhea.

Speaker 2:          02:21:10       That's just for those who thought gonorrhea was over his backyard. They got a rear coming on. It's Kinda read the class. I took a question. Is that the clap? Gonorrhea as the class, I would assume it was that

Speaker 1:          02:21:24       two thirds of a syphilis occurred amongst men who have sex with men. Wow. Most syphilis is gay syphilis. Interesting. There are 377 reports of children with congenital syphilis. Which means town with it. Yeah. Syphilis. The transmitted from person to person. It's a bacterium. Disease caused by long. It's caused by bacterium can cause longterm complications and slash or death not adequately treated. Sores can occur on the lips and in the mouth. Syphilis can be transmitted during vaginal, anal, or oral. Sexual contact. Pregnant women with the disease can pass it onto their unborn children. Whoa. Damn you. Syphilis. Syphilis is a motherfucker. How quickly the symptoms appear after infection. The average time between infection and with syphilis and the appearance of the first symptom is 21 days, but it can range up to 90 days. Woo

Speaker 2:          02:22:21       did. I knew a guy who used to say that fucking pussy with was the best

Speaker 16:         02:22:26       pussy. That is crazy because it was so hot because it was like feverish, feverish hot. Oh my God. I think it's safe to say that guys. Silly Bitch. How many times has he done it? That's crazy. Oh Man. I forgot to read the fucking male whores all looking for bitch with gonorrhea. First of all. I did not. I'm not here for a long time. I did not say it like that. That's number one. Get someone that lava pushing. He's been live at

Speaker 15:         02:22:56       multiple posts.

Speaker 16:         02:22:58       If motherfuckers that love period pussy you know to do, I can't even look at that fucking dragon when there's bloody track and well, when I was like, well, after my mother died I got a call from some checkout, a bike, like she called me up when the note was still living in the house. Like I was still living in the fucking house. I would walk to a house because in those days you had no fucking text or nothing. You got to dial that long. Motherfucking number two. You had to go deep on your fucking phone and walk over, walk but bitch back. Remember when to check lyft and another part of the distance and long distance and you couldn't fall in love. There was no skype. You had a whack off on the phone that costs you $10 to wipe off. Remember sports phone? No body.

Speaker 16:         02:23:40       What is that? Sports phone. Where's your phone for the general gamblers that cost you thirty five cents to call. They updated every 30 minutes though. Oh, you remember that? That was the only thing. The only time outside of sex calls. That's it, but this is back in the eighties man bar shooting pool and the motherfucker come and go with one of the knick game. I don't know, course sports phone. I call the second phone line once while I was beating off and I was a kid and and, and pain. When the chick asked me, can I help you? Can I help you? I was like, Oh yeah. I was like, what am I going to do? How am I going to pay for this? I don't have a credit card, but I just just all over myself. So that's all you need. Sometimes just the voice. He's like, oh, you're back. How much? I mean that's probably how many dudes probably called people up.

Speaker 15:         02:24:25       Remember how far they were on the phone. I remember it being a security guard at night at this complex they were building for seniors and the only thing to do was like you bought at night, you just call the phone. So I used to go down to the party line, like I ran up like a thousand dollar bill in like a week. So I'm a security guard and I got to pay this shit back then taking the money out of my check. I'm basically working for this party line. It was just crazy. Wow. That's one of those. What happens on a party line. He just talked to a bunch of people. That's incredible. It's almost like it's the chat phone. Internet. Yeah. It's like, yeah, chat roulette now basically. But how many people were in the room with you when you would call? You called the number you talked to like three or four people in. Some people just listen. Some people contribute. Some people will get off the people that joined on and never called the party line. No, I never called. It was. It was addictive until I got that bill. Then I was like, shit was expensive. Yo. That's isn't that amazing

Speaker 1:          02:25:24       that they could just charge you to connect your fucking phone lines together and charge you ridiculous amounts of money and you don't even know what you. It's not like you see it like running like a meter. So you can go, ah, just hang it up. Those lines. Sometimes there'll be girls. No, but you can't see them. You know, it was just talking. Are they from your town? No idea. No idea. It was like, I don't know if it was an 800 number or some shit like that. I bet a lot of people probably pretending they were from your town way from Kansas. I'm from Kansas to get you coming to get you. I'm coming to get you out. I'm on my way. I saw a show about a guy who got tricked by these Nigerian scammers and it was fucking sad. This poor dude went to Europe twice.

Speaker 1:          02:26:07       He believed that this girl was waiting for them in Europe twice. See that kind of creepy ass fucked up. Yeah. It's like, what the fuck, man? He got went there twice. Loneliness sucks. Sucks hard, but that's how social media works on a computer. It's just from back in the day when we used to make those phone calls to those party lines. People just been lonely for ages. It's just a way to connect without being in front of somebody and then that's why facebook and my space is so successful for was well, people literally get sick when they don't have contact with other people that if they don't get sick physically, they get sick mentally. Something something goes wrong. You will go to a strip club and you can tell the dudes that are fucking lonely bro. They bring the chicks gifts. Oh yeah. How's your brother?

Speaker 1:          02:26:55       Yeah, let's do a dance. I really don't want to dance for you. You see those guys and if you interview a stripper stripper, and she started to tell you those stories, your heartbreaks and like really sweet guy came in and gave me $800. Sit and talk to you for now. Well, when I used to go to visit Eddie, when Eddie worked as a DJ, you know, I got to watch some really crazy shit. She got to see the girls were just like, you know, they'd be like your friend, like, Hey, what's up? Hey, how you doing? You know, like Eddie was like, just like friends with all these girls, they would come in and then guys would like buy them cars and this one girl, the guy came in and she immediately was like, oh my God, how are you? She puts on this act and goes runs over and hugs him and she's like, she's really hot and she's naked.

Speaker 1:          02:27:40       Okay. She's really hot and she's naked and the dude is a zero, you know? He's a Dorky, sad, goofy, confused guy who's just not that good socially and doesn't understand is being played. And I think he had like a regular job too, man. It was like a fucking postman or some shit, but he would blow all his money on her and he got her car, like at least they're like one of those Nice Yukon's. So like it was crazy, but they just take them like a vampire as fuck. Just draw them in and just, just for the guy, just to be in contact with the girl like that is enough to chicks. The guys that give them the most are the ones that don't push. They don't want to

Speaker 16:         02:28:22       listen. When I kidnapped that dude partner, my partner and my partner on the deal, the reason it's motivation, like you know when you go to acting class and they're like, what's your motivation? Is Motivation for the kidnapping? Was he was dating the chick? No, no, no, no, no, no. He was friends with a chicken strip club that danced naked. Her and her husband had a beef. He threw her out. She loved the guy, you know the guy, but she wouldn't sleep with him because she was Catholic. She couldn't sleep with until she got divorced. This guy was giving her all his. It's the guys that don't get the pussy that give the most. Yeah. It's a story as old as time. It's fucking amazing. I want to be into the stripper part of the story, but when you say the time I kidnapped that dude, I just can't.

Speaker 16:         02:29:12       I can't just, I don't know the stories. I can't just disgusts me that, uh, that I saw that when he told me he came to my house, they looked at mine. It's like, oh, we got kidnapped. Or at that time it wasn't a kidnapping. He's like, we got to rob this dude, I need the money. I'm like, well, he told me the story and I'm like, oh, did you have like red flags going off? Like, it wasn't even Robert and for the good of it, you know, he was robbing for a check so she could get divorced. Oh, oh, here's where it gets better. He owns the house. His mother had a bunch of houses. She was a real estate mogul. He fucking had her. And one of the House was Doug Benson Lynch gentlemen. He had, um, one of the houses, free rent. He was paying the rent for it.

Speaker 1:          02:29:53       That's so common. It's just girls in this powerful. Doug Benson said, buddy, it's very fucking girls have been doing that forever. But guys been doing that. The girls too, man. It's like people get played. I think if you want to be a victim, some guys want to say, I want a girl in a car. Nothing happened. Well, it's also that these guys are so that the girls are so out of their league that they're willing to do. Almost anything to get in. They can't believe these girls or even talking to them. I mean girls are tendons, man, incredible body, beautiful. Look at that ass. I can't believe she's sitting on my lap and she's stroking his hair and puts her tits in his face and juggles and back and forth, and this dude is gone, man. He's in heaven. This is. This is closer to heaven than he's ever been because no girl would ever looked at anything like this has ever touched them and no girls ever really wanted to touch them. Some dudes that go through life without anybody being like really passionate about them ever. No one's attracted to them. They they're socially awkward. Who knows what kind of fucking weird childhood they had and this girls can do a number on a dude like that.

Speaker 16:         02:30:59       Hey man, there's no way she could. There's no way could stop her. Especially when know chicks sitting on their lap and they like seeing chicks like this. Sit On dudes. A lapse in movies and it's like you're just living in the movie lifestyle just for a moment and you'll pay for any. Can't believe. It's ready. You believe there's trained agents who are like chicks

Speaker 2:          02:31:20       in the CIA or trained to get fucked to like set people up on our 100 percent. They've done that. Yeah.

Speaker 16:         02:31:27       One hundred percent. They've gotten people to the point where they were were undercover and they had to have sex with people unquestionably,

Speaker 2:          02:31:33       but they. Do you think they train them? Do you think there's like a show to a training center for hot girls want to listen. If you're going to fuck this guy, you can't fuck them like an agent. Okay. You gotta fuck. I'm like, you're crazy bitch. And your cock monster. You've got to learn how to study these videos. This is a girl named Amber Lynn in the eighties. She was a monster. Just a cock monster. I know this dude that runs like charm school, right? So he works with the federal government. The FBI like to teach the agents how to not get seduced by women. Really? Yeah. So that's what you're saying is, is real. So that's probably right because it's a powerful weapon. I mean you can. If you really want to take down that at present, you can take down anybody with a body with a woman.

Speaker 16:         02:32:24       Yeah. Sex is. It's so powerful to someone who can acquire it. It's like one of the most sweetest nectar known. Well, if you can acquire it on a regular basis, it loses its power, but it's just like getting your heroin fix everyday. They're like, yeah, and then nothing. It's just fucking heroin. There's a lot of functional heroin users who's a lot of functional sex addicts. You know when you're involved with that type of a crime. That's why I always laugh when I read about drug bust or something because the general public doesn't know when you have that. When somebody is selling 80 kilos a fucking month, guess what? That'll make that many mistakes. Right? For an agent to infiltrate them, they have to do something different. Yeah, like when I was locked up in the federal joint for a couple months, I got to meet people, told me stories about shoot the fucking blow with agents says that the agents crossed the line. The agents got got out. They go to trial. They go to rehab and they get there. Then they don't have in their system, so I'm in court yelling, I got high with Duncan. You're like, that was a year ago. Prove it, prove it, but it's amazing. You know? That's why you know I'm going to sell a kilo of coke to a guy who doesn't do copeland.

Speaker 2:          02:33:33       I don't do it. I'm a business. That's the weird fucking thing, man. Really weird thing, man. Where the cop is CIA agent or whoever it is begins to turn into the thing that they're hunting begins to like get sucked into that and then there are the criminal shit. You have to.

Speaker 16:         02:33:48       There's no way looking when you go talk to attorneys, if you ever get in trouble when you go talk to attorneys, you can talk to. These dudes are very booksmart. The attorney you want is the guy that knows his way around the court system. The Guy who went to college with a judge who's going to cut a deal, he went to school with the district attorney. You follow me? You got these guys are very book. Yeah. They know the fucking long litigation that goes so far. It's the motherfuckers that could cut a deal to have. The same thing applies with cops. If you're going to bust a, you got to become a criminal. You gotta think like him. That's why these guys, they show you all straight laced. That's bullshit. You got to think like them. There's no way a guy. There's no way a guy that looks like a.

Speaker 16:         02:34:30       whatever's you went, Solomon, solemn of mushrooms, you following these have to look like fucking Charles Manson. He's gonna. Have to eat a cup of mushrooms in front of you. Then you'll get them announce there's no way. It's common. Fucking how many times have agents had to do asset in front of people? Just fucking gas. Tons of it all, but that's how the FBI does its local fucking county. Listen to have county sheriff under coverage. Those are the filthiest from the covers there. Vice of the filthiest under the covers there and once you hang somewhere, you see them come in and see. When that was a boulder, I worked at the patrol car wash, so they had a contract with the town. They would all come in. They would just go around with confiscated cars. Sure. If you're a cop in boulder, if you're a competent boulder sheriff department, you don't arrest people in Boulder.

Speaker 16:         02:35:16       You go to the mountains and the undercovers in the mountains come down to boulder, so you're taking. Let's say I confiscate Joe Rogan's, bad ass car. I'm not going to drive around boulder. That's dumb. People going to to Joe Rogan's car. No, I take that same car and I go to fucking Colorado Springs and I become a cop and that's how they do it. They don't take your stuff and used in the same county. I became friends with those guys. Those county guys had beards. They wreak the booze. They were out every night. It's weird that they can confiscate your shit and confiscate your shadow. I watched a, a, an episode of top gear and the American version, when they confiscated a corvette, zero six and they turned it into a cop car dealer. You're in jail watching TV going. That's my guts, your fucking car. It's amazing about this deficit that we have because if they confiscate all this fucking blow in cash every year.

Speaker 16:         02:36:09       What the fuck does it go? What the fuck does it go? Are you from Grove County Dunk? Uh, uh. Yo, Tarzan. You from Grove, Columbus, Grove county high school or something. You know what that is in Columbus. Worthington. What were you doing with grover's and Columbus Grove or something? I just walk around the city. Grow city. Let me tell you how bad a shape Columbus Ohio was in grove city to play high school football. You gotta pay $150 a semester as fucking parent for your son to play in a public school dog. They had to cancel the program. The band of Grove city is one of the top five high school bands in the country don't exist. No more lonely. She wanted to talk to me about sending motherfuckers to Mazda Shit again. You have to pay high school now for your kids to and it's going to be a growing thing across the country because of the fucking school budgets that if your parents. What you want to play in high school sports now by the year 2015, you're going to have to pay for your son to play high school fucking sport, my friend. So put that in your pipe and smoke it the time tonight with magic. If you go home and watch real sports, they did a pretty nice thing. I magic motherfucking Johnson. They

Speaker 7:          02:37:15       said that's the cover. He went from dead man to a fucking gazillionaire. He went from a fucking dead man to be in the fucking gazillionaire. So Watch we'll sports on HBO. They always do beautiful fucking things. That shit. Pay One hundred 50 each parent for each kid. Kids you know, you know brother, inner city. It's ridiculous. When you think about how much money gets spent on other shit, bitch, you know there's a six point $8. Billion dollars is what we spend a month in Afghanistan, six point 8 billion. They could spend six point $8,000,000,000. The the astrophysicist Neil degrasse Tyson said that they could come up with some incredible, a webspace telegraph telescope. The government pulled the plug on it because they didn't have the money. They'd have the money to discover new planets and possibly search for life or figure out what got us here, what could prevent the demise of the world.

Speaker 7:          02:38:10       Instead, they got all this money for Afghanistan. We still in Afghanistan. Anyway, we got bin Ladin. Well, if he talked to the really crazy people, they say heroin. Heroin. Yeah. They say heroin. The really a crazy conspiracy theory guys. They say that it's all a big heroin operation. Well, yeah, because like if you want to fund black operations, you do it with drug sales because it's untraceable. So if the CIO wants to do completely untraceable operations, they just blow. They confiscated. Or when we had guys on from vice vice.com, they. They were just saying that essentially there's no other way it could be happening because 90 plus percent of the world's opium and heroin comes from Afghanistan and we're in control of that area and there's video footage of soldiers that are actually like guarding the fucking poppy fields. It's craziness. It's like you look at it and you go, this bizarre shit.

Speaker 7:          02:39:04       How has this on television? How is this real? It's all the shit that people in conspiracy theory chat rooms had been saying forever and what's oxicon synthetic heroin when you got all these pills that will lose their minds over heroin, not dimension. How much about fucking profit? I invest $50,000 a pound. The heroin, I could chop that motherfucker, don't make me make my profit 10 times. I could walk out of there with $450,000 on a fucking kilo of heroin right now if they could ever really proved that the government has always been selling heroin place. That would be. That would be insane times if you really found that out. I mean, when you say the government though, and it's like it's not really. They're all different branches and shit. It's like you can't really blame the FBI if some dea guys are selling heroin, you know, you can't blame the NSA. The CIA is doing something because it's kind of all different organizations. But if we found out that one of them was actually long term selling heroin, if you watch, let's say you also the movie American gangster, how the fuck does a black guy from Harlem? Hey Man, I'm

Speaker 16:         02:40:14       just because you're black. I know what I'm saying. This is your shift or black guy. A black dude ends up. You know, it's funny. It's like it's such a proud moment in black history that you got to fight for the negativity. No, he did that shit. Fuck that Joey. A black man. Black. Nothing. There's nothing. How does a black ended up in fucking Vietnam? Copland. Heroin guys. Yeah. You think that gate and that thing was just made for him. He had helped me that that was something somebody comes up and goes, hey, sure, fuck the guineas. I know what he gets for sure. We're going to take you to Thailand. Thailand. Yeah. Let's go to the fucking time. Not only just the Thailand into the city, but until the jungles when they fucking process and you got to do a white dude. Black Dude is going to go in there just like that.

Speaker 16:         02:41:00       That's what you're trying to tell me and come back and go in with $200, million cash. That's what you're trying to tell me. So he did that alone just. And I'm not taking away to nothing from no black dude. I'm just saying. I'm just saying that, you know, first of all there's no winning this fight for this. His brother wouldn't go nowhere with two of the Gita. He got 200 g's. I ain't got nowhere to go, Doug. You know what I'm saying? I'll sit here to this 200 to $200 million. Whatever the fuck he took over the wild way to live your life, man. A lot of people don't believe that story anyway, now they don't really in it like in Harlem. Oh really? What I'm saying? He's saying Frank Lucas didn't do that. And, and they just, they just say he was a chauffeur. You know, that there's people that downplaying, oh, he's a chauffeur.

Speaker 16:         02:41:45       He didn't do that. It's just, you know, there was three and two of those motherfuckers. There was two or three, those motherfuckers that Ran Harlem in the fifties and sixties and all they were with the same thing as my father. My real father came from Cuba. They needed a fucking face to go in there. Know fucking Cuban's ain't going to buy from no Jew and the fucking guineas aren't gonna. I ain't going to buy from know Italians. So they took this fucking. They took a couple of black guys and they made him. They said, listen, we'll cut 30 percent, 30 percent of $500,000 profit. That's a lot of fucking money when you live on the fifth floor of the fucking building dog. That's $150,000 a month times three or four. So they became a pipelines to the black community. Don't fucking. There was no, there was no genius there.

Speaker 16:         02:42:30       The guineas came to them. They cut it 50 fucking times and they gave it to the brothers and the brothers got it. Then they fucking sold it. And if you go to, if you went to New York and you grew up in how many motherfuckers you see, not the light. Listen, that's why, that's why I buy my coke from white people.
