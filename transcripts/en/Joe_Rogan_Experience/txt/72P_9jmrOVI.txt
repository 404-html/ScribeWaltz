Speaker 1:          00:00:04       Just press the music. Let's just go right with music. We have no uh, no commercials today. I like it. Golden. What? Commercial Free Ladies and gentlemen for brought to you by the universe. Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:00:16       Experience Joe Rogan podcast all day. Ladies and gentlemen, a very special episode podcast, sponsorship free, Dennis Mckenna and Josh Twickenham.

Speaker 1:          00:00:30       Josh is from the Ethno Ethno Botanical Stewardship Council, one of the founders of this. And what exactly does that mean for folks who have no idea what ethno botanical or stewardship means? A lot of people struggle with counsel. It sounds like you're counseling people and ethno botanical stewardship. Look, imagine bringing that up at a party.

Speaker 3:          00:00:54       Well, the ESC is dedicated to transforming lives through assuring the safety and sustainability of traditional plants. So that means a trans transforming people's lives through experiences with plants. But it also means the sustainability of plants and the safety in their use. So we're starting with Iowasca and uh, it bogus.

Speaker 1:          00:01:16       Yeah, you should. You shouldn't start with like ferns. People don't get excited about a, it's hard to get eucalyptus. People really want to get fired up about that. But Iowaska, anything involving tryptamines for folks who've experienced it, it's something worth saving. Exactly. You guys find it odd that in this day and age, in 2014, the average person who you would go up to to try to discuss these issues with would have no idea what you were talking about.

Speaker 1:          00:01:46       Actually, I think over the last few years that's kind of changed. A IOWASCA is emerging into mass consciousness and I think that's, that's a good thing. I would say 10 years ago, 15 years ago, if you approach the average person on the street and you've said Iowasca, they'd look at you like you had a speech impediment or select, but chances are people would recognize it now and not in necessarily know what it's about. Not necessarily have a negative or a positive view of it, but the meme is out there and I think that's a good thing. Ultimately it's most certainly a good thing. I agree with you. That means it's certainly out there with young folks. But with folks, um, I'm 46 of folks my age and older, it gets a little sketch, you know, it's like, wait a minute, what, what are you doing? Folks who already have mortgages and families? Those are the ones that's very difficult to get them to even consider what you're talking about.

Speaker 3:          00:02:44       You'd be surprised the ESC has sent out a call for experts and we've been until infiltrated by the mainstream people that do evaluation work for the World Bank and USA id. They're interested in Iowasca. People are going down to south to have these transformative experiences to sit in ceremony. There's a lot of underground activity in the US as well in Europe where it's not legal, but in South America and Peru, Iowasca is protected as national patrimony.

Speaker 4:          00:03:13       That's awesome. Yeah. So beautiful. Do you ever worry that you're being infiltrated by government agents who, uh,

Speaker 3:          00:03:21       who would want that? I mean, I'm not doing anything illegal. We're working in countries where Iowa Ska is, has been used for hundreds of years traditionally, and we're looking at increasing the safety of it so that we're creating a kind of self regulatory model. So that we can take that model to places where it's illegal and say this is a totally safe medicine if you do it right. People with certain medical conditions shouldn't take Iowasca, but uh, done with a skilled curandero or shaman in the right setting. It can, it can be helpful for all sorts of psychological issues or ptsd or depression and just give people a new perspective on their lives.

Speaker 4:          00:04:06       Most certainly. I mean, I'm completely joking around, but what I was saying when I was like, you know, that hasn't happened with marijuana marijuana is they're still fighting it tooth and nail despite all the evidence that it's not just beneficial but probably prevents a lot of cancers and does a lot of fantastic work with ptsd and with anxiety and all sorts of issues, medical issues, you know, interocular pressure for people with Glaucoma and you know, on and on and on. People with aids that are having a hard time keeping their appetite up. Cancer patients, I mean it's still, they fight it tooth and claw and Iowasca is a completely different barrel of monkeys. WASC is coming at this through the back door and I mean it's interesting that it has gained recognition over time to the extent that it does and to a certain extent I would say it's, you know, Josh, people like Josh and me, we say we work for the plants, right?

Speaker 4:          00:05:06       And ios has got its own agenda interestingly, and people go down to South America and they have these experiences that are regulatory and self transforming, but often they come back with an enhanced ecological consciousness and enhanced awareness of the connection between humanity and nature. The idea that nature is threatened. And I think if Iowasca is sort of a messenger from the community of species that's trying to, you know, tell the the, these monkeys to wake up, you clowns, you know, it's, you know, we're coming down to the wire it, we're in a crisis here. You've got to really understand where you fit into nature and do what can be done in the ever shrinking time that's left. So people come back with this renewed sort of awareness of the interconnectedness of life and that we have a role in this. You know, we primates and we have to really understand what our role is as, as stewards of nature rather than exploiters of nature. And I was, you know, that's the message that delivers to many people and unexpectedly they may not be going there to, uh, you know, to experience that. But that's what they come away with. From your work and from your brothers work.

Speaker 1:          00:06:28       Terence Mckenna, what, what I got a that I'd never considered before was that psychedelics in, in various forms may very well be responsible for why we are human beings in the first place. And our separation from them might be the whole reason why we're so haywire. Why we're missing a crucial ingredient involved in the creation of cognitive thought in the first place. The creation of this ability to look at ourselves and communicate our ideas and really become a human being. And then we were separated from the mother and left to our own devices and all of our wild animal instincts sort of take over and our animal instincts sort of don't coexist peacefully in this weird world that we've created as human beings. And then we create chaos because of it, because we can't see what we're doing. Right. IOWASCA allows you to see what you're

Speaker 4:          00:07:26       IOWASCA. Yes. I asked her refocuses the whole understanding. I think of the relationship that we have that we have to nature. And I think that's what, you know, if you believe in plant intelligence, I mean there are different ways of looking at plant intelligence, but it's, it's interesting how often people, you know, they come out with this renewed understanding and I think that's, that's, you know, a desperate to call on the part of the community of species and Ios has been delegated to be, to kind of lead that conversation.

Speaker 1:          00:08:01       It's fascinating that Iowasca is the one that's been in the forefront when mushrooms are so damn easy to grow. You could, I mean anyone can essentially get ahold of some spores and start cooking them in your basement like really quickly. Whereas IOWASCA is probably the most complex common atory beverage that we know of as far as like psychedelic bruise. It's the one that requires the most knowledge. It's the one that requires the most care and creating. And it's easier to extract DMT and than it is to create iom and get all the plants and brew it together and know someone who really knows what they're doing, how to cook up a good batch. It's weird that that's the one.

Speaker 4:          00:08:43       Yeah, it has its. I think it's because it is so interesting. You know, it, it, it's escaped from its home in the Amazon and that's the area on the planet with the greatest bio diversity and all that. But it's got all those associations, you know, people regard it. I mean mushrooms are also important, but they just don't seem to carry that same. I don't know what it is. Emotional kick Iowasca gives the one right now that's getting all the attention, you know. And, and it's quintessentially a plant. Mushrooms aren't plants, so maybe that's part of the disconnect. I'm not sure. But you know, all of these things in indigenous cultures are regarded as plant teachers. And, and as you mentioned, a lot of it comes down to trip to being chemistry. And you know, our brains for some reason are evolutionarily prime to react to tryptamines.

Speaker 4:          00:09:45       I mean, we have these tryptamine detectors for some reason and I think it's partly that we can, so that we can receive and interpret what they're trying to tell us and what they're trying to tell us is there's not much time left and we have to really, really understand our relationship to nature. We have to realize that we're not separate from nature. Well, you're trying to overcome at least 2000 years of Judaeo Christian history. And, and you know, the, those traditions, they're 10. Their whole agenda in a certain sense is to devalue nature. You know, nature is something that we own. It's there for us to exploit. It's up there for us to rape. And, and we're busy doing that because, you know, my, my problem with those religions is the focus is always on the afterlife. So it tends to make you devalue this life. It makes you, uh, you know, it, it, it teaches people to devalue nature, to devalue their bodies, to devalue personal experience, uh, all of these things. And that leads to the very out of balance situation that we have going. And uh, you know, what's, what's disturbing to me is that we're all part of this circle of, of the converted. I mean, we, we got the memo, you know, and, and the meme is spreading, the memo is spreading, but I'm not sure it's fast enough.

Speaker 1:          00:11:14       Do you think that it's possible that the human race is essentially cramming? You know how when you're about to do a test and you put it off till the last minute and then you know, the day before you're like, Holy Shit, I gotta deal with this. And then you'd go bananas. You'd taken adderall. You filed through books until your head wants to explode. That is a characteristic that's very, very common for people that want to attack a project. Especially an important project. It's almost like we have this thing where it has to be completely overwhelming where it can't be ignored. And then we go into it full throttle. Is it possible that the human race is and that maybe part of our self destructive tendencies are actually us recognizing that we're fucking up and going into it more chaotically, more materialistically, more shallow, more nonsense, more Kim Carr, dash in more American idol, more horse shit just to get you to the point where you get so sick of it, you, you, you puke it up and then move on. Yes.

Speaker 3:          00:12:22       Yeah, and we're in the middle of an ecological crisis and time is running out and we certainly are cramming. We're, we're destroying the Amazon. We're destroying the climate. We're destroying

Speaker 1:          00:12:32       the ocean. We're destroying the air. We're destroying everything. We get our greasy little hands on,

Speaker 3:          00:12:36       and this is the first time in the 500 years of European colonization of the Americas that there's a kind of reverse, a reverse sort of message coming from the Amazon. People are going there not to convert, but to be converted, to learn to learn the traditions and the indigenous people. Ninety five percent of their population was wiped out by viruses or wars or plagues. And, and now we have this opportunity to come back from the brink and work with Iowasca that grows in the canopy of the rain forest. You can't have Iowasca without the trees and it's so it's an alternative to mining and oil exploitation and there's money to be made in it. And I think coming back to cannabis, the reason the dialogue is starting to change is because governments are realizing there's a lot of money to be made. Taxation. It's a solution to budget crises. Um, and the same with Iowaska tourism. I don't like to say tourism because people are legitimately seeking a spiritual experience. Some people just want to go have an experience, but yeah,

Speaker 4:          00:13:45       assuming wrong with the word tourism. But I know what you're saying. Like the frivolous. I think it does. I think we, you know, I, I think I asked it, tourism is a beautiful way or a pilgrimage. Yaps is [inaudible]. I think that tourism is a, is a phase in our relationship to Iowasca. I think that I think that potentially if we couldn't, you know, what I view is going on now is kind of a rough period. But what is really being played out here is the co-evolutionary relationship with these plants that have gone on, as you say, ever since we became cognitive beans. In fact, it was the plants that triggered that and now and that conversation is going on and that, but now the conversation has gone to a new level where Iowasca before was kind of, you know, the, the, it was under the stewardship of indigenous people confined to the Amazon.

Speaker 4:          00:14:42       Now it's circling the globe. And I think this is partly, this is what plants do. They like to spread and they're spreading out into different cultures. And the plant itself is now, you know, even if the Amazon is destroyed, which it may well be, I ask is not going to be destroyed. It's too late. It's already escaped. But I think, you know, hopefully we can arrest this process. But, uh, what you're seeing is, has always been a evolutionary relationship where, you know, at some time, some points it's more quieter, it's underground, but at some point says as the crisis deepens, it's becoming more and more public in a sense. Uh, and, uh, I think that's what you see going on, you know, and, and potentially I think that Iowaska, you know, we're now discovering that it's good for so many things, you know, therapeutically for addictions, for depression, for ptsd and that sort of thing.

Speaker 4:          00:15:44       And that's all to the good. But we shouldn't make the mistake of thinking Iowasca is only for sick people, you know, it's, it's, we're all wounded and we all need to understand something about our relationship to nature, potentially the paradigms that are emerging in Ios get tourism or these more, you know, these eyewash gets centered spiritual communities in the states. Potentially this has the, uh, this may transform mental health care in this country. It may transform psychiatry and from that it might transform medicine and it might actually transform all these other institutions that we have to deal with whose values have become twisted over 2000 years of, of bullshit and, and indoctrination. Uh, you know, these institutions are not going away and they're fine. They just need to rediscover a moral dimension to the consequences of their action, if that makes any sense. You know, uh, our cleverness far exceeds our wisdom and that's a problem. That's the problem we've got to become wise and when we couple that with our ingenuity and our cleverness, them will be on the way toward saving the planet, saving ourselves.

Speaker 1:          00:17:12       I think there's also this growing understanding of all the factors that encompass a healthy person and how many of them have to do with your conception of reality. How many of them have to do with the way you think, how many of them have to do with how you view your environment. If you view your environment as hostile, stressful, antagonizing, angry, negative place, you'll get sicker and your body fight. It doesn't know what to do. It's fighting it constantly and you're, you're in a battle and you're all stressed out and you're susceptible to all sorts of things and they're in. In that sense, there's a direct physical between psychedelic experiences and improved health and that's something that people really need to understand. And I think once that catches route, once people grasp that concept and understand the incredible pressure, alleviating alleviating properties like our. I can remember one of the first times I ever did DMT, the, the, the, the day afterwards, like I had this completely different view of the world that I had to sort of apply now all these other and like figure out like do all these, the, these factors that I've considered as being important, how many of them am I going to throw out?

Speaker 1:          00:18:32       Like the way I described it as like my computer rebooted and now only has one folder on the desktop and that folder is labeled my old bullshit and so now I have to open this folder and go, okay, how much of this is valid? Like Jesus, this is my whole thought process. This is my whole mind. This is how I interface with reality. Unfortunately some of it made its way back in, you know, and then you know, I had to do another trip a few months later and then I threw out more of it and it was a sort of a, a, a deliberate process of reevaluation. You can't reject it. All

Speaker 4:          00:19:06       good stuff in that folder. But I think what the DMT experience, the psychedelic experience does, you know, that's partly what it does. I like your analogy of the folder because now you're looking at the folder from the desktop. You're outside the folder, you know, so it's liberated you, you were imprisoned in the folder before. Now you can look at it from the outside and you can go through and say, oh, you know, delete, delete, delete, oh, this is good. Let's keep this, you know, let's integrate it. So, uh, you know, ultimately this is a process of a personal cleansing both physically and emotionally and psychologically and your encounters with these things, but also cultural cleansing. You know, I mean, there are, there good memes out there and there are good things going on, but there's, you know, there's so much noise, there's so much bullshit. It's hard to sort out what's worth preserving and what needs to be dispensed with.

Speaker 1:          00:20:06       I think we're also kind of trapped in this weird world of our creations as far as technology as well. I think that technology, just like corporations, just like anything that sort of becomes a force that's constantly growing, it becomes a, it has a certain self preservation, a aspect to it, and I think that we're completely connected to the idea of constant innovation and constantly improving technology and that also is completely connected us to materialism because materialism is the real driving force behind constant innovation. If we all just looked at our laptops and said, I'm good, are you good? There's no need to call apple right now. Hey, these are fucking great. Stop right there. Right? You literally don't need to improve internet speed. You don't need to improve the laptop. Everything's wonderful. Let's stop all this and let's move on to something else. Well, that's not what everybody wants. Everybody wants the newest, latest, greatest, fastest dual video processor. I want to screen that roles and folds and.

Speaker 4:          00:21:10       But that's part of the trap. Yes. This idea that we have to keep upgrading to the iphone 10 or whatever. I mean, these tools work and there and it in the proper way, uh, they can be tremendously important for consciousness, evolution and transformation. That's what the psychedelics are, they're just tools. There are kind of technology and like I say, often to my classes and they'll elsewhere. Technology in itself is neither good nor bad. Drugs are neither good nor bad. These technologies, it's all about how you apply them. That's where the moral dimension comes in. That's why, you know, you can use, you can misuse technology, internet technology to, you know, propagate whatever the Kardashians are doing lately over the Internet. But you can also change hearts and minds with, with those tools. Like for example, uh, you know, this live streaming symposium that we're, that we're involved with that were our mandate is to plug this thing.

Speaker 4:          00:22:13       But it's important. You know, this conference coming up in Amhurst is just one example. Amherst, Massachusetts amherst. Oh, I know it well. It's Capitol of Massachusetts. Perfect place to do this symposium that's coming. That's going to be live stream people should go to. It's a cute name, symposium, p s y m p o s I, u m, and it's going to be live streamed. And if you go to the website, uh, you couldn't sign up for tickets for live streaming at one more time for people that were struggling. Posey, m, P, s y m p o s I, u m cute, right? Yeah, I'm hard. I'm posing them.com. And if you go to their website, what you're going to see right now, which I had nothing to do with. You're going to see a little trailer for live streaming and streaming and it's actually, it looks like a stealth advertisement for my new product coming out, which is the Dennis Mckenna bobblehead. I'm in this trailer and I looked like I have a movement disorder or something. Then, you know,

Speaker 5:          00:23:24       let, let. And why do you, why does it look like you have a movement disorder? Let's, let's play it. You want me to play? I know we're playing it right now. Okay. Go to full screen. You'll see what I mean. I was, I just looked at it this morning and I thought actually this bubble hand ideas. What's going on here? Let's see. I'm just bouncing Hamilton. Maurice, how high was the person who made this pretty high? Pretty high. This is, he just made it last night. I looked at it this morning and I said, seriously, she really liked this to be on your whole page. There it is. You know, the important thing is get past the, the, uh, the trailer and you can, you can sign up for this symposium, which is these guys, these young fellows of NAM pursed are really enthusiastic and good, good people. They want this conference to have an impact and I think it will.

Speaker 1:          00:24:24       Amherst is one of the few places in Massachusetts I consider living. I got familiar with it. It's great. It's A. Yeah, I've heard it. I had an ex girlfriend who moved out there when I was in high school and I used to go out there and visit her. Yeah. And, uh, I remember thinking, Whoa, this is like a totally different world out here. It's all like birkenstock wearing strange hippie openminded. Right? It's just a weird, sort of a strange place in the middle of western Massachusetts. Western Massachusetts is a strange place in and of itself because you have Boston w, which is a very big city, a very educated, more colleges per capita than anywhere else, but then as you get out of Massachusetts, you might as well be in Kentucky for about an hour and 20 minutes and then you get to this weird oasis where like the the woods part and then you know, you have this strange place in amherst was really highly educated and open minded liberal community. Well, I'm not sure I've ever been there, but I'm looking forward to this conference. You did enjoy it. A lot of fun. Yeah, it really is the perfect place. It's very much like a very small Austin in the middle of of Massachusetts, but with no music, not as much music.

Speaker 3:          00:25:36       The guys organizing the conference really are working with the plants and for the plants and you don't have to go there to participate. The the beauty beauty is this, this live sign up for 10 bucks. You get a screening of neurons to nirvana a great film and access to all the presenters and interview.

Speaker 4:          00:25:57       Have you interviewed or shown neurons to Nirvana on your. No, I mean it, you know, from a technical point of view, I'm not a filmmaker, you can criticize it from that point of view, but as an educational tool for psychedelics, I think this is really an interesting movie and it's the kind of thing you can sit down with your parents and watch and they will come away. Maybe some of their assumptions will be shaken, you know, I mean, it's a very good educational tool for, under the subtitle is understanding psychedelic medicines and it's entertaining, done. And it's a kind of a review of the cutting edge research on a, bout four or five psychedelics, Mtma, Lsd, mushrooms, Iowasca, uh, and where the state of the art research is on that. And these, these, these chemicals. You know, what we need to do, as we were talking about before, we need to change hearts and minds. I know it's a Cliche, but these chemicals under the right circumstances are actually a way to do that. And coupled with that is education. Education is so important and that's kind of the vision of these gentlemen, Brett Green and the and his colleagues that, you know, symposia like this are an important component of this because it's a way of getting the information out and the more people that can be gotten out to, the faster the change can be. Can Be implemented.

Speaker 1:          00:27:34       Yeah. They. The change hearts and minds is an interesting cliche because we've heard it so many times. It's almost like we've heard Wolf Wolf, Wolf. There's wolves, there's wolves. Holy Shit. There's a wolf, right? The first time I did any psychedelics, the first major one besides Mtma was mushrooms and then that was my first experience like, oh my God, there's a wolf like this is. This is a totally different thing. This isn't something that you have to believe in. This is something that's unavoidable, right? Doesn't matter if you believe in it. Exactly. He doesn't care if a parent for it to, well, you can't be. I really don't think you can be. I think you can be. The best you can be prepared for is to give up. Just let it go. Don't fight it. Being prepared for that. Take a few yoga classes, know what it's like to be uncomfortable and keep breathing and then just then do it and then listen to it.

Speaker 1:          00:28:24       Surrender to us. The message is there. Yeah. Will. You said earlier, which is a very controversial but oddly fascinating thing that plants are the reason why we are human beings today. Why in these plant medicines and these these psychedelic compounds, w why is that so controversial? I find that to be incredibly amazing. When I talked to really intelligent people and I bring that idea up and they dismiss it like almost instantaneously and I don't understand why because I get it, that they're connecting the idea of a drug to a bad thing. I get that, but when you want to talk about powerful influences on cognitive thought, is there any more powerful influences on cognitive thought than a psychedelic drug? I don't think there is. I think I. I don't understand why that wouldn't be immediately considered at the top of the list, top of the short list, but it's not. It's Harrison. See,

Speaker 4:          00:29:24       that's the thing. It's an unconventional idea. I mean, if you look at, you know, we as a species, we evolved in the rain forest initially and we evolved in an environment of incredible chemical diversity, you know, and it's absurd to assume, you know, and the reason they're such chemical diversity in the plant kingdom is that they're great chemists, you know, and they make all these chemicals for whatever purposes. That's how plants mediate their relationship with their environment, right? They, they substitute biosynthesis for behavior. This is what I say, this is a cliche. They can't react to their environment through behavior. They can't run away, they can't fight. They fight through chemistry. At, on the other side of that coin is we are chemical systems. I mean, I hate to break it to you folks, but we're made of drugs, right? That's why drugs work. We're biochemical engines.

Speaker 4:          00:30:24       Our brains are biochemical engines that run on neurotransmitters. These plant compounds are our neurotransmitters essentially. I mean, you know, they were in plants a long time before they were in our brains before they was even complex brains of fte utilize these things and are, you know, in the course of evolution, we internalize these things, have adapted them to our own, like internal signaling processes. So now we have the, you know, the neurological tools if you will, to talk to the plants, you know, they've always been talking to us. Now we can actually have a conversation and the ca you get into the conversation and the conversation is, you know, uh, you monkeys need to move to the next level. You need to get more conscious of your place in nature, our place in nature as a species. A realize that we're not separate from it.

Speaker 4:          00:31:19       We're part of it. And if it goes down, we go down. I mean, there is no, there is no escape. There's no ticket out of here. I'm not yet see any way and, uh, and the plants or the tools to understand this, you know, I mean, there's good scientific studies now that show that silicide button, which is the one that's been studied, can reliably induce a state that you might call a mystical experience. I prefer to call it a transcendent experience, but the, you know, the nugget of the experience that it can elicit other, the right experiences. This is an understanding of a, we are all one, you know, we're not separate. That's the core of the, I think the mystical insight that psychedelic spring about why should our brains even have evolve to have that kind of experience if it's not a way of, you know, kind of a, I don't know, uh, being able to initiate that conversation with, uh, with the rest of species.

Speaker 4:          00:32:28       I mean, they're counting on us, you know, because never before we've civilization and humanity is impacted nature and adverse ways. As long as we've been around, as long as we've had fire, you know, fire back in the Paleolithic and even earlier was a tremendously, not necessarily destructive force, but it was a transformative force on ecosystems. We didn't particularly use it in a conscious way. We we used it in a way that that served our, our purposes a, but now with 7 billion people on the earth and counting and technologies that no one ever imagined that we'd have at our fingertips. What we do now really matters. You know, because we, because before that nature, the homeostatic mechanisms that tended to take nature, keep nature in balance, you know, we could cause tremendous ecological destruction and nature with eventually, you know, that would fade away in nature would come back into balance. Now we're actually in danger of permanently screwing up those mechanisms so we actually have to kind of consciously intervene or be conscious of what we're doing because the consequences of what we do are just so much greater. Does that make.

Speaker 1:          00:33:50       Oh, it absolutely does. It absolutely does. I think there's another thing that we need to put into perspective is the relatively short amount of time that human beings have had access to the information that we have today and the, the, the terrible effects of propaganda and how long propaganda can stick. You know, when we're talking about just the just say no era of the eighties, the Nancy Reagan nonsense. I had Dr Carl Hart on recently who's a brilliant dive. You aware of his work, amazing work on, uh, addiction and, and, and sort of educating people about the actual real reactions that the human body has to drugs. But what he's talking about it was really interesting is like there has never been a drug free society, nor would you want one. You know, it doesn't exist. So this, this idea is so stupid that it's been hammered into us this impossible ideal.

Speaker 1:          00:34:48       And it's, it's because of the ability to communicate. It's ironic that, you know, the, the ability to communicate through mass amounts of people is so recent within the last few hundred years, thousand years, whatever it's been that we, the impact of these things, although in our incredibly small, finite lives, seems like forever is a comparatively just a little tiny blip on the radar where, where we've had this sort of cultural hiccup where we lost the script and the Internet seems to be what's resetting the, the information. And I think that's one of the reasons why marijuana, besides the financial reason, my marijuana has gained so much steam. The, the, just the sheer overwhelming avalanche of facts, the of desks, the ld 50 rate of 1500 pounds in 15 minutes. Like just the sheer absurdity of what it takes to kill you. And then the stats that come in. I mean, how many times can you see someone posted with the numbers? People die by cigarettes, uh, numbers. People don't buy prescription drugs. The numbers of people don't buy alcohol, the number of people. And you just start looking at that and then marijuana gets to the bottom. Zero. Well, what the fuck, you know, it's over and over and over and over again. It's resetting. This is strange propaganda, but to people that have been alive through it, it's indoctrination. It's and how we've come to understand the world,

Speaker 4:          00:36:12       but the message is penetrating now. It is now with all that cultural baggage that that is, that marijuana is loaded down with. Finally, the real message is coming through when people are exactly like you say beginning to wake up to it and compared to all the other recreational drugs that we accept, this one is benign and beneficial.

Speaker 1:          00:36:35       I've said that I think that in the future when people look back on this age where people were being arrested in prison for marijuana, they're going to look back at the same way they used to look at at killing witches. Yeah, exactly. It's really that ridiculous. It's just, it's so. It's such a a black mark on our, our silly society and just an indication of how disconnected we are.

Speaker 4:          00:36:57       This, this concept of a drug free society, as you say, is totally absurd because you know we're. We're made of drugs. In fact, we are drugs and uh, you know, uh, our brains run on neurotransmitters and whether they're endogenously produced and we know, for example, that dmt is an endogenous neurotransmitter and that's a whole fascinating area of neuroscience now, potential functions for Dmt, uh, you know, are being found. We know it's been there for a long time. We've known it's endogenous, but it's not so clear what the hell it's doing in there. Now we're beginning to get some indications that it really does have a function, for example, in places that you wouldn't expect modulating the immune system. For example. All this stuff is emerging so, you know, uh, I mean by any measure, these internal chemicals are drugs. They just happened to be drugs that we make ourselves. We don't buy them from the local pot dealer or whatever. So, you know, so the perceptions are, are changing. I think. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:38:06       Three, I think, um, again, I attribute the Internet and um, some of the workload that uh, rick strassman has done. It's been pretty fascinating as well. And the most recent work showing that DMT is actually produced in the pineal gland of of live rats, which was always, for whatever reason, even though everyone knew dmt was a endogenous neurotransmitter and that human beings absolutely produced in the liver and the lungs and different parts of the body. The pineal gland has always been ultimately incredibly fascinating because it literally is that third eye, the seed of the soul, and there was so much resistance to that idea that this mystical chemical is actually produced by the third eye. And I saw online like all this battling back and forth of, well, it's only anecdotal evidence that it's produced by now. There's actual physical evidence. There's know it's there.

Speaker 4:          00:39:00       We knew it had to be there, all the enzymes to make it all the precursors to make it were there, but nobody had actually nailed it down. Now they've nailed it down. So that's progress. That's a step.

Speaker 1:          00:39:15       But that's the, the, the, the resistance to the idea was very fascinating to me. Like why, why would anybody care whether or not it was pretty. I mean the body makes it for sure. Like why is it such an issue that the pineal gland makes it, but it is. It is because that sort of opens up the door to eastern mysticism to all that traditional religious art that showed the glowing third eye and you know, all these peaceful, enlightened beings with a lit third eyes, like all of that is like, oh well, they probably knew something like, oh, there's something to it. They did know a thing. Well, they knew quite a bit. Right? Because the other thing is the Egyptian artwork that so clearly resembles the pineal gland and the actual cross section of the human brain and there's. There's so much of that in ancient civilizations, in ancient cultures. It just makes you really try to piece together like, when did we lose all this? Like what have we figured that out? When, when did all that sort of slip away, it gets lost.

Speaker 4:          00:40:19       I mean, obviously it's not lost. We're now rediscovering it. It was just, it was esoteric, you know, it was esoteric knowledge for a long time. Now it's becoming less esoteric. More people are becoming aware of what the ancients knew, what the visionaries of the mystics always knew. This is no longer hidden knowledge, you know, it's becoming more accessible and that's partly the effect of the Internet and partly the effect of a lot of very smart people obsessing over this, you know, and sharing what they're finding out. So again, this is a, I think, part of the general raising of consciousness in this area that's going on now.

Speaker 1:          00:41:04       Amber Lyon, who's a, she was a reporter for CNN and a sort of lost their faith in mainstream news when she did a piece on Bahrain and it got a redacted and edited and turned into like a tourist piece and she, you know, she left CNN. It was this huge thing. She was really like trying to figure out what to do with their life. And uh, I, I suggested psychedelic drugs. So she goes down to Peru, takes like, just jumps on a plane, like literally grabs what clothes she had in her, jumps on a plane, goes to Peru, take seven. A long Iowasca trips completely changes their life, goes on a year round journey, your long journey to discover various psychedelic medicines and in different indigenous cultures goes to Thailand and does mushrooms, goes to Mexico, just does all that. Now she's writing or making this website called reset me. She's dedicated her life to psychedelics within one year, one crazy transformative trip and it's people like her and people like you and people like you that are putting this information out and starting this sort of like undeniable tide is shifting, is undeniable shifting, right?

Speaker 3:          00:42:18       Right. Psychedelics and neurotransmitters aside because people expect something big when they take these things and people are rightly a little apprehensive. I mean it will change your life if you take these plants, but if you want to have a transformative experience with plants and you're leery of psychedelics, try going on a an all plant based diet for a little while. Change your intestinal bacteria and way you'll. You'll have this sense of levity, lightness. It will change the way you think about yourself, not as quickly as a psychedelic plant experience and it takes discipline or try a fast. I mean, there are ways to have these, these transformative experiences without drugs, without plants, but it's just

Speaker 1:          00:43:04       the only transformative experience that I've ever experienced from dealing with people that have gone in a completely transforming their life in a completely plant based diet is they can never shut the fuck up about the fact that they're on a plant based.

Speaker 6:          00:43:17       Well, you have to, you over the head with it. It's a hard lifestyle to maintain. Yeah. Um, and in, in light of, of the

Speaker 1:          00:43:28       new information that's been discovered over the past decade or so about the intelligence of plants, about plants' ability to calculate their ability to recognize, um, uh, perhaps even a memory, their, their, their ability to recognize dangers, their ability to adapt. There's a consciousness in plants that is undeniable and I think very misunderstood or not understood. That's not a word, but we're, we're ignorant to it. And that's one of the problems that I have with people that push the plant based diet. Like I don't think. I think life eats life and I think it always has. And I think, you know, you can get to the very bottom of the Karma chain where you're, you know, you're a fun guy and you're living off of poop and you know, basically things that things are thrown away or you can be a tiger, you know, and they're all beautiful. The whole system is crazy and beautiful.

Speaker 1:          00:44:24       And the only reason why we exist at all is that a fucking star had a die. You know what I mean? The whole thing is death. But we're so obsessed with this idea of eating only plants or you know, eating, being on a plant based Diet connects you more to nature. I've become a hunter over the last year and a half and I, I couldn't disagree more. One of the reasons being is that hunting is a very psychedelic experience and weird way that I never would have believed. Um, the first time I ever went deer hunting and shot a deer and then wound up eating it. There's a weird connection that you have with nature and with that animal. When you do that, especially if you do it and what's termed a fair chase environment, you go out into the actual woods, you deal with an animal, most likely, that animal right there, it never even seen a human being before I shot it. And then we're eating it. That deer had, right? They're not the alien, the alien, that motherfucker he's talking to you. But I think that there's, there's life in everything and there's most likely some form of a consciousness in all life. And, um,

Speaker 4:          00:45:37       and I think brains are overrated. You know, nervous systems are overrated in a certain sense. You could say, well, how could a plant be intelligent? It's, it doesn't have a nervous system. It doesn't have a brain, but it clearly displays intelligence. And in fact, speaking of that, speaking of your hunting and experience, you know, the author Michael Pollan, right? Uh, he, he had a great essay and I think the New Yorker recently about plants intelligence, that if you haven't read it, it's worth reading. But I also love his chapter in the Omnivore's dilemma, which is, uh, which is subtitled the natural history of four meals. And one of the meals is a meat meal where he, where he wants to create a meal, but he wants to do it. He wants to put himself in the shoes of 100 gatherer, so he wants to gather all wild foods, plant foods, obviously mushrooms, pine nuts and this sort of thing.

Speaker 4:          00:46:42       But he also wants to hunt down a bore, I think it was, and kill it and strip it, skin it, cut it up and eat it and have that experience. And I think that what you say is totally legitimate if you're gonna eat meat, it's important that people realize where that an animal died so that you could have that meal and native Americans, indigenous people have always recognized this because they are up against it. So, you know, they'll always think the animal for what their kid, aiden. And that's, uh, that's really important. And that's something that we should try to integrate into everything. Why not thank the plants too. Thank you. Know, thank everything we wouldn't be here if we weren't sustained this web of life. So why are we being so disrespectful to it? I mean, I guess that's the crux of the question, will we

Speaker 1:          00:47:38       can't really feel what we're doing to this earth in and we, we have this diffusion of responsibility thing got me to the grocery store and wrapped in plastic. You have no notion where it actually came from. Yeah. I've made a commitment this year to live entirely off of a game. Meat of wild game, all wild to nothing that, you know, no pendant animals. They just wind up shooting the hand that I was telling you guys about before the show smoking ham. That's a pig. I killed a on this ranch to hone ranch and they actually have to have hunters come in because these, these are invasive species, these wild pigs and they will destroy everything. They deer fawns, they grounding a ground nesting birds. They eat their eggs. I mean they're, they're unbelievably devastating to the environments that they, uh, aren't naturally a part of.

Speaker 4:          00:48:33       Right? So there's a role for us as stewards of the environment, these, these wild boar, sir, unless you say they're devastating ecosystems. I don't know in California, but Hawaii, this is their biggest problem and it's destroying ecosystems in Hawaii. So there is a role for us to step in and say, well, you know, we're going to kind of exert some control here and control that population because they didn't originate in Hawaii. They are invasive species, as you say, from your agents need for some regulation.

Speaker 1:          00:49:06       Well, there's an issue right now in San Jose, San Jose, they've started to make, make their way into suburbs and they're destroying people's lawns and uh, you know, they'll, they'll, they'll have children.

Speaker 3:          00:49:15       Do you fucking shit.

Speaker 1:          00:49:21       Yeah. Um, it's, it, it is a weird connection. The connection that, uh, that we have to, uh, to, to life itself and the, our thoughts when we talk about native Americans, like almost immediately we think of the spiritual connection that native Americans had to the land, the deep respect that they had for the animals that they killed in the fact that they would use every single piece of that animal. They'd use the hide to make the a roof or close they would use Sydney, you for, for uh, for strings, for their bows and arrows. The, they literally used every part tooth, bone, nail flesh. They ate them and they worship these animals, you know, and it was, it was a deep respect. It was an inexorable part of the relationship to nature itself. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:50:15       I really hear you on this. I grew up in the woods of Michigan mile outside of a town of 150 people and my uncle is a hunter and a taxidermist, but hunting for him as a spiritual quest and experience and you feel the pain of the animal you kill and utilizing all aspects of it. I'm not, I'm not opposed to eating meat by any means. I'm just saying that an Alpine plant diet when when you do it properly can transform consciousness. It's a, it's a strange thing, but going on an all meat diet and eating that conscious, conscious eating can change conscious, conscious, subconscious everything, right? Every design of institutions, of, of the Internet, of our experiences.

Speaker 1:          00:51:00       Yeah. Other people, when you were talking about earlier about brains being overrated, one of the things that I've really, it's been inescapable for me over the last few years or so is this idea that we're the caterpillars that are giving birth to the moth and that our whole screwy system and our whole, you know, are issues with ego problems and materialism might be because we're just sort of a transitionary stage to this symbiotic relationship that we have with technology and then we're going to give birth. There's some artificial thing that doesn't carry the burdens of natural selection that doesn't carry the burdens of primitive instincts, the needs or survive all these animal reward systems that were built into us from the time that we were monkeys.

Speaker 3:          00:51:50       Perhaps it doesn't sound like a very nice existence.

Speaker 1:          00:51:53       Sound like a nice existence, but I'm not sure about that. This is why bounce it around because I don't know. I don't know if it's better. I mean the idea is that, well, if I'm not a person, well I'm fucked. But is that the ego hanging onto that? I mean, is it is some sort of hyper intelligent artificial life that's capable of living completely, uh, completely self sustaining existence where you're totally solar powered all garbage or any waste product whatsoever. It's factored immediately into the equation instead of put off like nuclear waste where they just dig a fucking hole and Oh, we'll figure that out later. That's madness. To me, the nuclear waste issue is one of the most maddening and insane issues ever where they take these things, they build holes and then they put it in there and then they seal it up.

Speaker 1:          00:52:49       Like, what do you look a little kid like, are you fucking crazy? That's like what a little kid would do when they have to clean their room. They lift up the carpet, they sweep it under the, they put the carpet down. It's a childish way of approaching an issue. Instead of having a completely holistic approach to this, this thing like, okay, are we going to build this stuff? If we are going to build this stuff, what are we going to do about the toxic waste? Okay, well let's factor that in before we move forward. And then spend an extra few decades trying to figure out what to do with that shit and then maybe come up with a solution before you ever moved forward. But we don't do that. We have this weird thing that we just sort of put it off and we child companies have quarterly

Speaker 7:          00:53:26       reporting requirements. If we just changed the financial reporting structure just one year, a five year instead of this short term thinking, well solar panels are cheaper. At least this is what has to be factored into corporate planning, as you say, because in the operations have gotten a free ride for too long because they'd never pay the environmental consequences of what they do, you know? And we have to change that where they have to be held accountable and responsible for the environmental impact. It's not just that you pay $200 for an iphone, you know, you pay $200 for an iphone, but it cost $2,000 to deal with the environmental impact of the toxic waste. That economic equation has got to change. And that's one of the biggest challenges because it's a huge. It's a huge challenge to capitalism. It's, it's laying down the gauntlet and say, look guys, okay, you can make money, but let's make, let's look at the bottom line in the realistic way and you're making all this profit, but what are you costing the taxpayers and the rest of society for your profit making activities?

Speaker 7:          00:54:42       How about a little payback here? You know, how about, you know, some fun, some way to compensate for the damage that, that corporations do. And that's, that's the, that's the biggest threat that I can see right now. The corporations want to own everything. They want to corporatize everything. And nature is just another commodity as they see it to be owned and exploited. And uh, that's the perception that's got to change. And maybe one way to do it this to, you know, I, I think speaking of hearts and minds, I think if you can get in there are ethical capitalists out there, you know, chances are they're partly ethical because they took psychedelics at some point. I mean, Steve Jobs and people like that, you know, and um, we could name others. So, you know, psychedelics are teaching tools to help people kind of understand their, their place, their responsibilities, and uh, uh, you know, we have to, again, that's part of this.

Speaker 7:          00:55:48       It's not that we can't innovate, we just have to be realistic about the impact that our actions are having. We also have this issue with incorporations having survival instincts and corporations. This unlimited growth paradigm. This is impossible, right? Like what we're talking about with like laptops that. Can we just stop right here? No, we can't. It's impossible. And we also can't stop as far as profit. Well, we made this much this quarter and this quarter we showed a 25 percent growth. Excellent. Let's keep moving on by 2075, we should have all the money in the world. I mean, that's really what every corporation. And isn't this

Speaker 1:          00:56:24       what's happening? Yes it is. It's madness, right?

Speaker 7:          00:56:27       Got, what is it? Ninety five percent of the wealth concentrated in the one percent and the rest of us are, you know, the rest of us is, it's quickly evolving into a third world situation and, and that, that is economic slavery in a sense. I mean people do what they have to do because they don't have a choice. Their, you know, their economic activity, they're priorities are dictated by corporations. This idea that profit is the only thing that a corporation should be concerned with. We've got to evolve beyond that. Sustainability is more important. Uh, helping people's lives be better as more important than profits. I mean sure profits, but that should be down several notches I think, on the, on the totem pole in terms of what they identify as

Speaker 1:          00:57:25       important. I think it should be like food. I think profit should be like food in that you can't eat poison and that if you're eating something and look, we have all these calories. Yeah, yeah, yeah. But it's fucking killing you, right? You understand that you can't eat this. This is bad for you. Like don't like this, but it's got a thousand calories, you know, I need calories to where, no, no, no, you don't need those calories. That's poison. And, and essentially the idea of profit is profit overall and profit over humanity. You know, the idea of financial, financial gain over human suffering like that somehow or another it balances out is just like eating poison. I mean, it really is. There should be no profit at all when this human suffering. It should be one of those things with. It's factored in, oh we can't eat this. It's poisoned for humanity,

Speaker 3:          00:58:16       right? Yeah. The corporation in the u s if it does not maximize profit, can be sued by its shareholders. That's the law. They have a legal responsibility to maximize profit. That's so crazy. And so we have to change the laws that shareholders

Speaker 7:          00:58:31       until the shareholders start demanding that they actually act responsibly. So that's. I don't know how that works, but you know, if the shareholders achieve a higher level of consciousness, maybe they can influence the way the corporate.

Speaker 3:          00:58:47       It was a NASA funded study looking at collapse of civilizations and one of the major factors is the discrepancy in wealth that the wealthy people are using up the resources and they're insulated from the effects and then it gets to a point where the people making decisions haven't been thinking about the the the consequences and the alternatives and it's. It's something's gotta change.

Speaker 1:          00:59:12       Yeah, that's a. That was a fascinating and very terrifying report because this is not someone with any financial interest in relaying this message is not something that someone that's selling a solution, they're just looking at all the data and go and look. If you just follow these trends, this is where it goes. No, there's no, no indication whatsoever that it's going to slow down. This is, this is where we're going. We have to figure this out before we hit this wall.

Speaker 3:          00:59:38       [inaudible], when I was an Undergrad, I was in business school until I took five grams of siliciden mushrooms. Today I grew in my dormitory closet at the urging of Terence Mckenna's book. See old generic method under buying civilization. One chart at a time of civilization. Radical, but I realized that I was fighting a losing battle if I wasn't speaking the same language of making some profit of appealing to people's business interests. I. It was a long process. I wanted to get out of this culture and ended up in China teaching English and I've spent most of the last 10 years in China. I'm like a third Chinese now basically, and I became comfortable analyzing the situation I was in meeting people on their level because I can't. One thing being in China teaches you is to be constructive with people to come at an issue from how they're thinking about it.

Speaker 3:          01:00:37       So I began that. Why is that people don't want to lose face, so it's a, it's a top down culture so you understand the priorities of a leader and they have some enlightened interests. They have their self interests as well, and you appeal to their better image of themselves. What's possible a win win situation where, so I think of myself now as a kind of economic therapist. I talked to corporations, I talked to ngos, the campaigning organizations, and I try to help people find a balance. What is, what are the win win situation, so the last six years I've been working with the global sustainability standards like the forest stewardship council and the Marine Stewardship Council and the ESC is modeled on these organizations that you talk with enough stakeholders and you build consensus through dialogue and you have a transparent process that appeals to companies that appeals to regulators, so take Mcdonald's for example, they realized that they were catching too much fish from the ocean and it wasn't sustainable, so they now all Mcdonald's fish sandwiches are marine stewardship council certified, which means they can sell fish sandwiches into eternity as long as the oceans are a viable for life.

Speaker 3:          01:01:57       Or Kimberly Clark was cutting down the rain forests and cutting down the arboreal forest in Canada. Now all of their paper products are going to be FSC certified. An FSC certifies 15 percent of the standing forest of the world, which means that people have a fair share. This worship reserves, stewardship I think is really important. It's an important word. Gotten to be reintroduced

Speaker 4:          01:02:21       into corporate thinking in corporate planning as opposed to profits. I mean, we all have a stake in survival, not everybody has a stake in profits to the shareholders have a stake in profits, but there's no profits if we don't survive, if this whole shooting match collapses. So the concept of stewardship and I think that is, is really important to get that message out and that's what people like Josh or trying to do. And I think psychedelics have a role to play absolutely. In educating, you know, uh, I mean, it's interesting the, you know, we can't, it's going to be awhile. I think before Iowasca gets integrated in this country in a way, for example, in therapy and in biomedicine, it's not gonna happen, but what you do see happening are the centers that are growing up and right now it's in South America and Josh and Ethno Botanical Stewardship Council are trying to develop standards for these organizations so that, you know, they're committed to a certain ethical, a set of standards, safety and quality of their, of their brew and so on.

Speaker 4:          01:03:42       But I can envision a time not too far in the future where if a person, you know, you can go to South America and if you have issues, if you have sickness, addiction or whatever, you could get treatment, but even more importantly, you can just get an education, you can just get a, you can, you can go there for purposes of spiritual discovery and self discovery and all that. Once you have that infrastructure, which is growing, then it partly becomes, you know, we need to get people in positions of power, corporate ceos, other government leaders and so on, to go and have these experience. That's the big one, right? We've, yeah, I mean you can't hold them in a headlock and force them to drink IOWASCA. Although I'd like to

Speaker 1:          01:04:34       a catalyst for creativity. Take your marketing team to South America and have a ceremony together, rebrand your company. Exactly. Increase your profits in the process and the benefits to people. That's people. That's where the economic, that's where the model comes in. People have a negative reaction to that. And I know this personally firsthand because, uh, I have a business on it, on a.com is a company we sell exercise equipment and supplements and healthy foods. And one of the ways that on it was created was a, my partner Aubrey and I talking about it and Aubrey going to South America, doing Iowasca and then having these visions about his business. And when you talked about that, he was met with so much criticism. So many people were like, ah, you're down there doing Iowasca thinking about your business. Oh, that's so gross. Oh, that's so based. That's so egocentric. That, so the anti, you know, the, the message of the plant. But it's creativity and creativity. It manifests itself in a million different ways. And it is the idea of business equals evil really has to get, we have to get past that because we all exchange, you know, it's not evil. If some guy could fix your car, it's not evil. If someone can fix your, your, uh, your refrigerator so you can store food. All those things are businesses

Speaker 7:          01:06:00       not evil. If you buy fair trade, coffee promotes biodiversity and farmers can send their kids to school, go to hell. So it is. It's when, when it's possible to develop these economic models. So I totally disagree with your, your partners, critics. Your partner is exactly right on and it's okay. He, with his background, I assume it's a, he goes to South America and he already has the mindset, right? Then Iowasca is a way to sort of flesh out the vision if you were. I mean, he, he went there to learn something and boy to Dillard's someplace. Clearly he went through a bunch of other things about his life will, you've got to get the personal shit, clear family history, open up that bullshit folder, get hit over the head. None of us here has done that completely. I mean at some point the process. Yeah, no, no doubt about it. You know, um,

Speaker 1:          01:07:04       uh, I got a tank session scheduled for tonight on some little workout. Um, the, uh, the, the word ethical company or the expression ethical company I think is a, is a big one. And I think that this, this idea of the psychedelic experience for those who haven't experienced it or for those who, oh, I dropped acid in college, but I'm past that now. I've got a 401k in a mortgage and college bills for my kids and I have a lot of.

Speaker 7:          01:07:38       Yeah. But that's an excuse for not wanting to confront it. That's just, that's just self self delusion. Really. Nobody's ever passed.

Speaker 1:          01:07:47       No. No one ever, ever. If you're a human being and you have, you're a constant sort of soup of chemicals, neurotransmitters, adrenaline, hormones, all these different things are going on and you're trying to maintain balances and keep everything aligned and then keep the pattern of thought in a good place. So that maintains everything as well. I think that to these people that are perpetrating a lot of the issues that we have, whether it's the head of bp or you know, it takes some guy wants to frack and say, before you do that, do this first. And then let's talk, you know, like confronted with your own mortality should almost be mandatory. I mean, you should show that you went before. You start fracking, you should show that you have a degree that you understand the actual physical process of removing these chemicals. You should understand, you know, whatever energy extraction degrees you have to have in whatever science is that pertain to that, but you should also have psychedelic trips under your belt.

Speaker 1:          01:08:48       Like you'd say, well, you know, here, uh, I seen your documentation. You've gone through your five grams and what did you get out of that? You know what I mean? Like it should be one of those things where it's reviewed, like, okay, you haven't, okay, what you've gotten off your list before you proceed. It shouldn't be like a presidential council for psychological fitness. And they, they sit you down, they go, you don't have any psychedelic experiences on your resume. Ready the brain now? Yeah. What are you doing? Opening up the fucking company that digs holes in the ground and you don't have any psychedelic experiences. That's a recipe for disaster. So you're missing a key component. You're, you're missing this connection to the mother Earth via some unfathomable bowl experience that literally is impossible to describe [inaudible]. So you're missing that part. So go get that and then come back.

Speaker 7:          01:09:40       Then we'll talk about your business. Yes. Are People in the Department of Defense or the veterans affairs that are dealing with all these soldiers with PTSD? Another important aspect of the symposia. Conferences, a new organization called Vet Veterans for NPO genic therapy. Oh, that's great. Founders participated in the maps ptsd study with MDA and they came away feeling so much better and they want to open this up to other veterans and others suffering from Ptsd. So a portion of the proceeds from the [inaudible] conference in the live, the online live participation will. We'll go to this organization and to the ESC. That's spectacular. I'm a huge, huge fan of maps. I've done Rick Doblin on the podcast before. It was just a fantastic guy and he, uh, they just tweeted me something and I retweeted it about, uh, they did a new study on autism, uh, adult autism Mtma at assisted therapy for social anxiety and autistic adults and some amazing, amazing dinner. Charlie Grove working. Was he working on that? He's Charlie Grove who's a at Ucla. He's one of our heffter superstars, if you will know his name so we can get them on the poster or ob Charles Grope. He's at Harbor Ucla. He's done a. he's done a silicide. Been end of life study. He's a member of the heffter board. I may as well plug heffter here where the sort of a small organization that nobody knows about. Heffter.org.

Speaker 4:          01:11:15       A cow. No, no. F E, h e f, F, t, e r after, but after it's a nonprofit and basically we're committed to clinical development and clinical protocols with a, with a psychedelic, some of kind of staked out. Silicide been in some ways the same way that Mtma is. Map says things. Silicide business our thing. And we've got several really interesting protocols. FDA approved clinical studies right now for end of life, a existential anxiety at the end of life, uh, for exploring actually what you might call experimental mysticism because a psilocybin can reliably induce mystical states. Roland griffiths work at Johns Hopkins has shown this, so it's an actual tool for the first time we're actually able to approach transcendent states of mind in a controlled clinical setting. We can reliably, uh, induce these states and then study what's the brain doing when, when you're in a state of siliciden induced mysticism.

Speaker 4:          01:12:28       Well, that's doing a lot of things similar to the state of a mystical experience when you're on the nat. Sure. Whatever. I'm not sure that even. But anyway, heffter.org, most of the leading researchers in psychedelic science right now are either on our board are being funded by heffter and so we have funding and we're focusing on suicide, but then we work closely with maps, but maps gets all the attention, which is fine. They are doing beautiful work, but we're also doing effective important. Well, we'll, we'll certainly get some people to you. I'm heffter h e f f t e r.org.org named after Arthur heffter actually who's the. He was a 19th century scientist, the first person to isolate masculine in a pure form from pod and demonstrate that it was the main ingredient of, of payoti based on self experiments. So he was kind of exemplifies what we like to identify with, you know, good science driven by curiosity and ethics and uh, yeah, it's a good organization. The silicide been connection to dimethyltryptamine dimethyltryptamine being an endogenous chemical, a neurotransmitter, and psilocybin being very close, very close. What is the exact, like what's the chemical? Was the. Okay, very simple. Dimethyltryptamine is simply dimethyltryptamine a silicon, which is the active principle of psilocybin. PSILOCYBIN is converted to allison in the body. So it's what pharmacologists call a pro drug. It's converted by a very simple chemical reaction to silverson.

Speaker 7:          01:14:12       That's the one that actually interacts with the receptors. So silicon is chemically four hydroxy dimethyltryptamine. So it differs with one trivial substitution on the Indole ring. That oxygen, that alcohol group at the top of the Indole ring is what makes it sill a sudden. And not DMT, but it makes all the difference pharmacologically because silicon is orally active and it doesn't require an Mao inhibitor. And, and DMT does, if, if you need, that's the Iowasca secret, you know, dmt plus Mao inhibitor makes the orally active preparation by itself. DMT is not orally active, so you have to take it perennially by smoking it or indigenous people make snuff out of it and so on. And they get, get around that whole a detoxification mechanism. Your gut is full of his full of Mao monetary amine oxidase and the reason it's full of monitoring the next day. So it's a, it's a consequences of our evolution as omnivores because plants are full of, uh, means, uh, most of them are toxic and you don't want those.

Speaker 7:          01:15:26       You've got the, so you have the detoxification mechanism, but they had also works for dmt. And for that matter, we can't be dining on dmt containing plants all the time and wandering around. I mean, you do need to be able to function in the world. Um, your, your brother had a fascinating idea about, um, the, the idea of Panspermia in relationship to a suicide and suicide and being the, how did you, what is the exact nomenclature again for a high four hydroxy four hydroxy trip dimethyltryptamine yeah, that silicide been, I don't want to get bogged down in chemistry, but Phil Psilocybin for the chemists among you, it's got a phosphoryl group and that phosphoryl group is cleaved off and that yields Cilla sin. Sin. Sin Is four hydroxy die methyl trip to me. What is silicide been and silicide business for phosphoryl dimethyl methyl trip to me.

Speaker 7:          01:16:23       So it's got that phosphoryl group that makes it stable, right? So that's the form it's stored in the mushroom and it can be quite stable for a long time. Soon as you convert it to Siliciden, it's very unstable and it's a femoral, which is one reason why it's so easily metabolized by human metabolism. It's very compatible with human metabolism, which is a reason why it's so, you know, it's appropriate. You can give it to people who are quite ill, you know, in terminal states and so on, and they can tolerate it's, it's not a, it goes through a human organism like ice water. It's very easily handled. Uh, no, but, uh, we don't, we don't want to get to know down the road. Don't know. It's, it's absolutely fascinating. But yeah, the, uh, the idea

Speaker 1:          01:17:10       that your brother was promoting was that this may have come from another planet and that what you might be eating when you're eating mushrooms is you're eating some sort of an intelligence, which is the weirdest thing about mushrooms is that it feels like they're talking to you.

Speaker 7:          01:17:23       We do have that impression. This I thou dynamic that's set up and the content, which I guess not everybody has this, you know, this, this feeling of this science fictiony she cast to the experience, but many people do and they, they're not all terence Mckenna fans. I mean, if you, if you follow the terence mckenna recipe and eat five grams and the absolute darkness, you'll be utterly convinced that they've landed there here. And whether that's just an impression or whether it's, uh, you know, some, again, I think this is possibly something, you know, built into the structure of our nervous system, you know, and it may be, I mean, we've always had this, this fascination with, with space, with, you know, with, with the external, uh, you know, with the, the, this sort of longing to maybe return to space. Maybe that's where we came from.

Speaker 7:          01:18:30       I don't know, you know, but certainly in, in this, in this a evolutionary process of cognition, you know, which we credit the plants for. If we want to buy into that idea, we credit the plants for bringing about cognition. The ability to wonder, the ability to speculate. Well, we can't wonder if very much, if you're looking down at the ground all the time, you got to look up when you look up, you, oh, you know, there's this whole universe out here. And uh, what's our connection to that? You know, we, we, we've always had this intuition that there is a connection. I mean, I, I, uh, don't go so far as to say, you know, people ridiculed the idea that mushrooms might've come from outer space and so on, and I'm a surface, it seems like a ridiculous idea, but you look a little deeper and maybe not so much, you know, it's certainly possible that spores are one of the hardest substances in nature and they can survive. They can survive in a vacuum and radiation dense environments and they're not effective.

Speaker 1:          01:19:38       Did the other thing that your brother had mentioned was that it was so different than other life forms on earth because of its chemical makeup that he thought that the four hydroxy or for, for phosphoryl yeah, the four hydroxy form

Speaker 7:          01:19:57       floral, a biosynthetic pathway is really only found in this group of mushrooms, you know, actually unrelated species. Yeah. He wasn't, he wasn't a biochemist. I don't know if I agree with that. I mean mushrooms are so clearly a part of a, you know, earthly evolution that you can't really say that they stand outside of it to. I mean, we know that's true. I think if you want to make that hypothesis, you have to go further back and you have to say, well, you know, maybe a super civilization see did our ecology at some point, not with the genes to make a silly one, but the genes to make tryptofan and now tryptofan all these silicon and Serotonin and all these tryptamines come from tryptofan. And tryptofan is one of those 20 amino acids that make up proteins. So tryptofan is universally found in all organisms. It's, you know, it's an essential, a molecule of life, right? It's found in everything. But to trivial steps away from tryptofan too. Trivial enzymatic modifications away from tryptofan. You've got DMT. You know, you remove the carboxyl group, you stick a couple of methyl groups on Tryptophan and there you are. You've got DMT. And I've often thought, wow, maybe this is a sort of sub text, sub message of nature saying just around the corner, just around the corner from Tryptofan is, uh, this, this compound that opens the door to other dimensions, pay attention monkeys.

Speaker 1:          01:21:45       Fascinating that trip, defend converts to eventually converge to Serotonin. That is

Speaker 7:          01:21:52       Serotonin is just another trip to me. Uh, in fact, chemically Serotonin is five hydroxy tryptamine. Siliciden is four hydroxy die methyl trip to me. Blue photo name, another one of these hallucinogens is five hydroxy methyl trip to me. So they're all, you know, very close to each other. You see the diagrams, I'll hail. There you are, there you go. Right? So you can see how, how it works,

Speaker 1:          01:22:23       the idea that mushrooms come from outer space, it seems ridiculous to some folks, but the reality is we were made out of stars that everything comes from outer space and I think that as we get further along in our understanding of the universe, I think we're going to realize that everything is kind of fractal and there really is no separation between this planet and other planets of the whole thing is just one big soup.

Speaker 7:          01:22:45       Right, right, exactly. And, you know, any, um, prebiotic environment, I mean, we don't know that much about exactly how life evolved, but we know that in certain situations you've got to a buildup of organic compounds and, uh, under the right,

Speaker 4:          01:23:06       it just seems to be a property of matter. You know, Adam's molecules fall together in such a way that before you know it, you've got living systems.

Speaker 1:          01:23:15       You've brought this up twice and I can't ignore it because he brought it up in the last podcast as well. You, you are fascinated by the idea of life being seated here by some intelligent force. Uh, Amber Lyon, who, uh, I discussed earlier, she had a vision of that actually happening on Iowasca and many other people have as well. Do you think that that's something that is, is a real possibility? Yes, I do. Wow, that's a heavy one. When you bring that one up, you get thrown into that certain category right away. Oh, Dennis Mckenna. It's fucking gotta. Read my book. We actually in my book, I mean it was. Which one? My book. Oh, the latest one. The Old Lady. Latest one. I wrote the Brotherhood of the screaming abyss. Oh, that's the one you promoted last time you were on here, which is excellent. Which for that, that was really good. If you haven't bought it, please folks go by. It really gave her that. You really gave it a boost.

Speaker 4:          01:24:12       But I actually talk about that. Talk about this at some length about this idea. Could this really be, and I'm trying to, uh, uh, you know, discuss it from the standpoint of a critic of the idea. Say, well, that's totally ridiculous, you know, how could that be? And they just dismiss it. I tried to go a little deeper intuitive. Say, well, wait a minute, let's step back from this a little bit. And if you think about our existential situation, how unlikely it is that we are even here that consciousness exists, that this civilization exists. I mean in, in, in the, in the, from the standpoint of the improbables, we're living in a very improbable situation. You know, if we should, you know, I don't think this is going on. I think that life is probably a widespread in the universe, but I think intelligence is rare and the fact that we find ourselves in that existential situation, you know, maybe we need to look, take another look at this and say, well, maybe this is not such a crazy idea.

Speaker 4:          01:25:22       You know, that, I mean, I do think that intelligence, uh, you know, is, we're not the only ones. And I think, you know, and, uh, I don't know if I generated into incoherence here, but I think that intelligence can have an influence on the evolution of even the universe. You know, it's a force in the universe. And I think that mind is probably, uh, uh, you know, as primary, uh, uh, feature of reality as, as the quantum foam. I mean, it may not, it may not even be separate from it, you know. So it's okay to say we don't know. And, and, you know, one

Speaker 7:          01:26:04       of the problems with science is, uh, it, it tends to be arrogant to, tends to assume that it knows a lot more than it knows. And we actually have a, we have a very detailed understanding scientifically, of very small pieces of reality, you know, and so there's a tendency to say, well, we've got it all figured out. No, you haven't got it figured out. You haven't got even a 10th of it figured out, which is another useful a message that Iowasca and other entheogens, other psychedelics a reminded us of, you know, I mean, Iowaska never fails to remind me and a lot of people remember you don't, Oh shit, you know, you don't know shit, you know, so get off your high horse and be a little more humble and be open to learning.

Speaker 1:          01:27:00       It's all right in front of us. If we go back and look at what we know about human history and what they knew and how we laugh at what they knew, then we will go back to the time when they thought the world was flat, back to the time where, you know, they were killing Bruno because he thought that the universe was infinite back to. I mean, there's all these different things that people like how to consensus. Um, there were absolutely incorrect that we go back then we were foolish. That was a blink of an eye ego, right? So the message is

Speaker 7:          01:27:31       be aware of what everybody knows. Beware of cultural consensus, because chances are in 100 years what we thought we knew, we'll just be seen in that light. I mean, we were so stupid back then.

Speaker 1:          01:27:44       Yeah, that's also one of those things too, when you're discussing aliens be discussing the possibility of a, an alien life form. We want to think it's preposterous, but we're preposterous if we, if we didn't exist, oh my God, the most ridiculous thing ever right behind me, dead people that were locked in a cage and I honored them. This photos behind me of Jimmy Hendrix and the Elvis actually apparently wasn't really a, a, a mugshot. He was just a law enforcement not wanting to get his picture, which is even more ridiculous. He loved the fact that people got locked into cages so much. He wanted to get a fake picture of him locked in a cage is most likely, was high as fuck on pills, you know? And he went to the Nixon to be a drug and. Exactly. And then this woman, Rosa parks, she got arrested because she had too much melanin in our skin to sit in a certain spot on a moving piece of transportation.

Speaker 1:          01:28:40       And then she was celebrated as a hero. I mean, we're fucking crazy. Right? So totally why? Wow. Just the fact that we exist at all. Why would we deny the idea that something else far more advanced than us exists somewhere else? No, no different than us looking at, you know, when we find primates using tools and evidence of using tools without any human. Like they just figured it out how to do it on their own to get inside of and hills and things like that. We're fascinated by amazing. Look what we've discovered. Jesus Christ. It's easy. Shit, you know, like compare us to something else. They would probably look at us the same way. Look at these dummies. They're, they're worshiping people that were locked in cages. Right. You're a hero because you're sitting in a different spot.

Speaker 7:          01:29:22       That's the thing. We're. Yeah. We're observing experiment of some sort. And whether, you know, we're, you know, some civilization, some super civilization as genetically engineered this whole ecosystem and create a trip to fan and see did it into the ecosystem, knowing that over the course of evolutionary time it was going to develop things like siliciden and Serotonin. It's almost as though the civilization, this hypothetical civilization wanted somebody to talk to and in order to do that it had to invent as primates, you know, and it had to get us talking first to our plants and maybe eventually we'll get a chance to talk to them, whoever they are, you know, or maybe they're already here. I mean, there are a lot of people say they're already here, you know, and I,

Speaker 1:          01:30:14       yeah, I don't. Who knows, the other problem is there's so many people that are full of shit. Well that is the area where flakiness is flourishes hugely. I had this Saifai show, um, and we stopped doing it for and they wanted to keep doing it. But I didn't want to do it anymore because I got tired of talking to liars. I couldn't handle it anymore. We interviewed bigfoot Pete Boone Ufo people and some of them are well intentioned folks, but there was a lot of liars. There was a lot of people that were just. There was a psychological issue and I can clearly see it because when you have a podcast with someone and he sit down with someone for three hours, you can bullshit someone for a seven minute interview on a news show, but you can't bullshit someone for three hours after three hours. Weird things start to show up like weird patterns or will you just can't keep the.

Speaker 1:          01:31:06       Can't keep the rhythm up so to speak. Especially if you could do multiple podcasts like, oh, crack you. After two or three, I'll find you. You might be very clever, but after two or three little things get exposed and you're like, hm, we reveal the basis to keep the rhythm going. You know, it's just after a while if you're full of Shit, you're full of shit. Also to yourself, and that's something that I've found is that people that are constantly deceptive, there are also internally deceptive and that that manifests itself in weird things that they say that they don't even realize. They're bizarre because they, they're also easier to trick themselves I think because I think they lose their ability to really, uh, to, to see things objective,

Speaker 7:          01:31:55       falsifiable facts, things that you can prove that that's or not

Speaker 3:          01:32:00       the scientific method is important. And all of this theoretical conversation is nice about whether we had, we have the imprints of other civilizations in our, our ecosystem. But the fact is we have an ecosystem and we have maybe we delude ourselves that we have some control over its evolution or a stewardship of it, but we certainly have this opportunity to, to either destroy the planet or, or preserve it

Speaker 1:          01:32:27       well. We certainly have an effect and we're certainly conscious in some way, shape or form of that effect. And when you extrapolate that to a $100,000 million years from now, if the civilization or something similar survives, well you got to think that it's going to be something like an alien invasion that we, we, we, we really will be like that thing that wants to see the universe if we recognize, especially if you're being, if you're an intelligent being and you recognize that a star is a out we did, a star is only good to support life for another billion years. That's not a lot of time. If you really stop and think about how long time has existed on earth and if you were an intelligent species that lived 100 million years from now and you're like, hey, you know, we only have nine more of these to go. We have nine more of these 100 million cycles and then we're fucked. Then the Sun Burns out and there's no life here. We gotta get moving. You know,

Speaker 7:          01:33:19       we stuck here. Yeah, that's very interesting. I've often thought that these cosmological models, I think we got more than a billion years. The cosmological models say 10 to a hundred billion years, maybe a trillion years

Speaker 1:          01:33:35       with the sun, I think.

Speaker 7:          01:33:37       Hold the sun. Yeah, the sun doesn't have our planet. It's a support line. It's got maybe 4 billion years. But if we haven't figured out how to get out by that time, we're not paying attention, you know, but getting these costumes or Gideon, exactly. Or Gideon, that's a very important point that, you know, I mean, this, uh, I've been told on psychedelics many times the only way out is to go in, but, but this, you know, these cosmological models, if you look at them, which are kind of dreary and depressing when you think about it, you know, it's just now the current model is just endless expansion and not only expansion but accelerated expansion. You're talking about the heat death of the universe and you know, not very much interested in is going to happen. But the key factor that these models do not a do not integrate into their planning his mind and consciousness, you know.

Speaker 7:          01:34:35       And that makes all the difference that, you know, if you look far enough ahead, that's gonna affect the way the cosmos. He falls and uh, uh, you know, and they don't take that into account and it's impossible to really know what the effects of it is. But I don't buy the fact that it's all going. It just kind of Peter out. And finally the last flicker is going to go out and it's just darkness and cold. I don't by that I mean surely there's gotta be more to it than that. Well, the trip might be what we're missing. Our emr trip may be. Yeah, exactly. I mean if you look at quantum models and we know there's know three dimensions of space and one of time, but then there's the, what is it, the six or eight other dimensions that are all folded in and you don't see that, but what's in there, what's it?

Speaker 1:          01:35:30       But that's the feeling that you get on dimethyltryptamine is that you've entered into a new area, a new space, and that space is somehow or another inhabited with something that's communicating in some nonverbal forum that reaches you as intent. It reaches you like content and that that might be where consciousness is headed. Once we free ourselves from this sort of carbon based shell that we're, we're, we're clinging to that, we might figure that out. That like, oh, we're, we're, we're at a rest stop. We didn't realize that we could drive just a couple miles down the road and there's the fucking yellowstone national park.

Speaker 7:          01:36:08       Like, we got that, the rest stop. We thought that that's where we were eating shitty food and breathing trucker farts and we saw there was, oh my God, we just had to just figure it out. Yeah, I don't, I don't, I don't dismiss that possibility. I mean this, this I vow relationship and that we say that again, I vow. I vow this thing that mushrooms, other psychedelics for their specialty mushrooms seep to set up this dialogue situation. You know, when you're getting this information, but it's very hard to evaluate whether it's, whether it's bullshit or whether there's something to it. My, my brother used to play games with the mushrooms. You know, what he would take them at these high doses alone and say, well, how do I know that? What you're telling me is real, tell me something I cannot possibly know. You know? And they would never, they would never cough it up because it was like, you know. But it was like, all right, I want the blueprints to the star ship now download the blueprints. Now I don't believe that you're, you are what you say you are. And they're very invasive. You know, they'd never give you that kind of thing. But they. So, you know, I don't know.

Speaker 1:          01:37:28       I have this thought on, for people who've heard this podcast, unfortunately, I have to repeat myself. I have this idea that we have this, uh, this dismissal of psychedelic experience, uh, as hallucination and hallucination being frivolous. And my thought is that if you absorb some sort of a psychedelic compound and have this intense moment where you do pass into another dimension and you, you meet with pure love and the, the, the, the very wiring of the universe is exposed to you and you get to see the fractal nature of reality and some incredibly profound for them. And that is what you're actually experiencing. Or if it's just your imagination and you go there and it's all in your mind, but you have the exact same experience, it's still the same, like this idea that everything that's real has to be. You have to be able to take a tape measure and touch it, that you have to be able to put it on a scale that you have to be able to quantify the ingredients. Oh well it's made out of aluminum and this is glass and you know, the keyboard is plastic that, that. Now I know a laptop's real. No,

Speaker 7:          01:38:40       but I'm here to tell you it's all hallucination, right? Right. I mean, we dwell in a hallucination. That's what, that's what the brain does, is it creates a model of reality that is that we live in. We never experienced reality, you know, I mean we take it on faith really, that there's some external reality out there, but everything comes to us through the filter and is processed and extruded, if you will, into a more or less comprehensible most of the time, a model of reality and that's where we live. Reality is out there somewhere. It's unknowable, you know, but we're getting signals through this sensory neural interface and then the brain is basically a processing a device that takes that information, combines it with internal associations and everything and generates the hallucination that you and I and everybody else are living in at this very moment.

Speaker 7:          01:39:40       You know, we're all part of this constructed reality. So people dismiss it as psychedelic experiences. Hallucination, I would say. No it is, but it's just another hallucination and it's all hallucination. It's all or at least interpretation of something personal interpretation and personal interpretation. I mean the world physics. We know enough through physics about this supposedly external reality to know that it doesn't look anything like what we're experiencing, you know, it's all buzzing the electrons, most of it's empty space. This table is not solid. It's mostly empty space. It's soul energy and energy flexes. We don't experience the world that way most of the time. Sometimes on psychedelics we do. So maybe we're getting a, an actual peak into the way it's really constructed that, you know, we get to, we get to look at the circuit board and turn it over temporarily and look at it, oh, this is how it's wired. You know, this is the reality generating machine that you get to look at when you strip away, uh, you know, the, the, when you take the cover and look at the

Speaker 1:          01:40:54       way it's, it's, uh, the diagram is wired. Then you get some insights into it. So then that's a useful thing because then you can go back and you can say, well, none of this is real. Let's not get carried away that, you know, this is any more real than anything else. And that seems to be like the, the information that's coming from folks that study subatomic particles, that, that inflammation is one of the most undeniable pieces of information that the universe is not what you think it is. It's not what you think. It's just, it's impossible for it to be what you think it is. When you study subatomic particles, when you study things that can exist in two places at the same time. Like what are you talking about? Like how they blink in and out of existence. What does that mean when they go away?

Speaker 1:          01:41:35       What do you mean to go away? They go when they come back with the fuck. Are you saying go away and they come back? Are they here? Are they not here? Well they are and they're not. Well they move. Yes. But they also stand still at the same time was like superposition. Like when someone. I had Dr Goswami, he's a theoretical physicist. He tried to explain super position to me and I was like, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute. It's moving. And it's still at the same time. Right, right, right. What are you talking about? Like what does that mean? So here you have physics, you know, the absolute sort of cutting edge science, the one that we've charged with explaining the fundamental nature of reality. And you talked to these people and it sounds like the rates of schizophrenia, it sounds like someone who's on drugs. Yeah, it doesn't deem. It sounds like someone who may have the mathematics and the measurements and all that to back it up and say, look, I'm sorry, this is how it is. This what our math at our instruments tell us if you want to trust that. It's like we send a scout and the scout went over the top of the hill and saw the impossible. Yeah. And came back and go, okay. Yeah, yeah. Don't go over there.

Speaker 1:          01:42:53       It becomes a rainbow that talks to you, right? Yeah. Yeah. Um, that, that is, it's fascinating because the, uh, the explanations of reality by these physicists are in fact more bizarre than the experiences that are relayed by people would take Iowasca. Absolutely. Those are way more believable than particles and superposition or the fact that it's all empty space. Moving in a vibration. And why do you know it's wood, man? What are you talking about? This is would hear it and that's not. I hit you over the head. That shit's gonna hurt. This is real. There's no empty space there, dude. You're crazy. But no, that's. That is what it is. Yeah. Well, it's all real. Yes. Anything you experienced, you can't dismiss it. You can't say it's not real. It's just not necessarily the absolute reality and I don't know if there is an absolute reality. I agree with you and I think that's also one of the transformative parts of the psychedelic experience, that the experience itself is transformative because you're experiencing it doesn't matter if it's not real. What does that mean? It means nothing means nothing. Not Real. These are. These are

Speaker 7:          01:44:04       dualistic delusions. You know? It's none of it's real. It's all real.

Speaker 1:          01:44:09       So established, established fact that when you get to the lowest measurable portion of reality, when you get to subatomic particles, it's fucking magic. Okay, so we go from there and then let's look at. Well, it's all in your imagination. Well, let's look at what that means because everything you see on this planet that a human being has made has somehow or other popped out of the imagination. The imagination is a factory for televisions and the Internet and airplanes, right? Condoms and eyeglasses and laptops. I mean the imagination is a motherfucker and we have this idea that the imagination is this frivolous thing. Oh, billy just sits in the field and imagined what the world could be. How about your dig a ditch, billy, how about you go to work billy, hammer some nails and be a man. Pull yourself up by your bootstraps and stop crying because you're freaking out about the fact that everything's air. Everything is particles and it's all know the whole thing.

Speaker 7:          01:45:09       Or are you sitting in a field and you know, you take LSD and you're steve jobs and you have all these fantasies except that you actually make it happen. You create the apple computer or whatever. And that was a psychedelic vision and was at the time and remained so, and you know, this thing here, I mean this is the little psychedelic toy of the future, you know, it's in my hand that it exists.

Speaker 1:          01:45:34       Will you ask it questions and it goes online and it gives you the answer. So the entire volume of human understanding and that subject, the consensus, this is, you know, like where you were just explaining, explaining what the chemical definition of silicon is or the description of it. You can find that out like that. I had to go to you. You're an expert. You, you came to me with your, your education, you explained it to me and. But anyone can do that.

Speaker 7:          01:46:01       My phone just tapped into the database. Yeah. So that's some, that's a threshold we've crossed in the last decade or so where basically the sum total of human knowledge is right here. And that's incredible for transformation, for creative thinking. All of these things. That's something we've never had before. That and the conductivity. The other thing is now there are 7 billion people or something like that on the planet. Well, you know, I don't know what the statistics are, but 4 billion of them have cell phones, you know, so we've creating, I mean, they don't all have smartphones, but they got some kind of a cell phone, so they are tapped into this database and that's making a big difference, uh, in the way that, uh, you know, formerly disenfranchised populations interact. I mean, you know, you're a fish farmer and you have some fish to sell. You can go on your cell phone and say, Oh, well, you know, if I go to this village here, I'll get a better price for that, a trivial thing. But in fact that decision affects commerce on a global scale if enough people are tapped into that.

Speaker 1:          01:47:21       Anyway, your brother was obsessed with December 20, first 2012 being some sort of a transformative moment in our history. And uh, a lot of people were me included. I guess we can put that one to rest, I guess. Can we. That's, that's one of the things that I've been thinking. Oh yeah, yes, as a specific day. But if you really look at like the tipping point of technological technology and our connectivity and you know, that's kind of where it is, whether it's 2008 or 2012 when you're looking at a thousand years from now, when they talk about the renaissance, you know, when they talk about, uh, you know, what, whatever great periods of, of human history, whenever a very gigantic periods of change, this is going to be one of the biggest ever. And it really, really will boil down to these decades. Are these at least these few years.

Speaker 7:          01:48:16       So his, his error, I thought as I was kind of a critic of the timewave for exactly this I, but for folks who don't know, explain what that means, that's his, his idea that he created a mathematical model based on each thing that he claimed a describe the structure of time. I mean, he postulated that time had to structure and time had an end or at least history had a damned and that that end was December 20, first 2012. And there's a, you know, a linkages to the Mayan calendar which

Speaker 7:          01:48:50       supposedly said similar things. It was, it was a mistake to link it to a particular day. I think that's not the way that novelty, the idea was that this wave described the way that novelty in grest into the continuum. Well, I think that novelty ingressives in the continuum. I mean everyday there's something new under the sun. There is something that never happened before in the history of the universe. It happens, but it doesn't explode into the continuum. It more like it seeps into the continuum. But change does happen. And uh, we're going through a, a period of tremendous change, but it's not linked to a particular day. So what I say is he was wrong as far as the particulars were concerned. It wasn't December 20, first 2012, but he was totally right in terms of the idea that novelty does increase and it has increased and it's increased, it's increasing them, it's accelerating.

Speaker 7:          01:49:53       And all you have to do is look around, you know, and he was clearly right. I mean, if you look at where we are now, even from where we were 10 years ago and even 20 years, can any of us even remember what it was like 20 years ago? You know, I mean, the world has completely transformed. Yeah. So he was correct in that sense, you know, that, that, uh, that, you know, things are changing and well maybe in just putting a date to it and giving people something to focus on, he made the idea more tangible for some. It made it more tangible. But I think it wasn't, I think it was a, not necessarily a good strategy because it, it people were giving into the temptation of focusing on that date and it was either on that date, either everything's going to collapse or, or we'll cross the threshold and everything will be great.

Speaker 7:          01:50:49       And it was kind of a, you know, consciousness will be transformed and won't be in this golden state. And I, I thought it was kind of a, uh, for many people it was an excuse for not taking responsibility. I mean it and, and just all we have to do is wait. And then it'll all workout. No, you know, that's not taking responsibility. We've got to get cracking now. We can't wait. We can't wait. So now that it didn't happen. So the message is the same. We've got to get cracking and we can relax. Okay. The aliens didn't land. No wormholes appeared before our eyes. Yeah. None of that happened, but it doesn't mean that things aren't happening and you know, uh, to make things make change, I think happened quietly, you know, they're not noticed. They're not tremendous with, with obvious exceptions like a global asteroid impact.

Speaker 7:          01:51:48       I mean, hey, that's abrupt and it's transforming, no doubt. But that only happens once every few million years. Uh, events normally don't explode into history that way. I mean, tariffs used to talk about the, you know, the explode, the first explosion of the atomic bomb, you know, well, that was an abrupt event, but not really. I mean, the. When did the actual novelty take place? Was it when Einstein developed the equations that describe nuclear fusion? Or was it the fishing rather? Or was it the point where, uh, you know, we achieved the first sustained nuclear reaction. I mean, these were not things that anybody noticed at the time, but those were the transformative events that made it possible to, a couple decades later, dropped the atomic uttama on the atom bomb on Hiroshima, you know, and that's the one that got the headlights, but that wasn't really the roots of the novelty, if you know what I'm saying.

Speaker 1:          01:52:46       Yeah, no, I totally know what you're saying. And it seems that they're all pile onto each other as well, pile onto each other and they're cumulative. Exactly. And we haven't even started, most likely. No, we haven't started. Which is why the concept of an alien invasion seems so ridiculous to us based on our current capabilities, but so inevitable. When you think about the fact that we've got robots wandering around on Mars right now as we speak. I mean, what would we, where would we think we're going to do? I mean, what we do, the most spectacular thing we do, we have two things we do. We blow shit up and we explore space. Those are the two things that gathered the most attention, right? You know, we can, we can blow up a city or we can send a robot to wander around on Mars and send back videos and you're like, Holy Shit, those are the two very distinctly different. But this exemplify the limit

Speaker 7:          01:53:43       higher power. Yeah. We have the power to completely disrupt the whole shooting match and just, it all turns into radioactive slag or we escaped some way and I think, uh, you know, I think it's wonderful that we can send robots to Maurice and all this, but space is so fast. It's never really gonna become accessible to us unless we can figure out this hyper light thing. And I don't know if it's traveling the traveling faster than light or figuring out how to open up a portal. I mean, this idea that, you know, there's Tony Newtonian space separated by this vast distances. I don't buy it. I think there's a way to get from one place to another without going through new to hyperspace as a real thing.

Speaker 1:          01:54:35       Well, it might get down to, to learn how to navigate it. It might get down to we just have to be stopped being carbon based life forms. It might know that made it real space travel. Right. It may end up that way too. When you, when you look at the possibility that dimethyltryptamine and similar psychedelics are a gateway to, to some other thing, whether it's another dimension and the state of being another access to a part of the mind that, that doesn't, doesn't exist. Do you think that, that. Is that. Is that something that I'm trying to figure out how to say this, but is that something that is like, it's going to take a long time before that's something that you could pass off to other folks that haven't experienced that and have them accept it and is there a bridge to sort of, uh, getting them to consider these ideas?

Speaker 7:          01:55:36       Well, I really, I, I don't know. I mean the bridge, the most convincing thing is, you know, here's, here's the pipe, smoke the pipe. You don't need me to tell you. As you mentioned before, and it's quite true. One of the beautiful things about psychedelics is you don't have to have faith, all you have to have is courage. You know, you have to have enough courage to sit down and put that pipe to your lips and you know, we can get beyond this conversation very quick. Yes. Then we can have the real conversation about what is all that mean, what did, what happened and what is the real, what happened? Are We, you know, are you a tapping into some external, again, these, these ridiculous words that are dualistic, enhance, you know, but are you tapping into some dimension that is not part of you or is it, or are you looking at a, you know, a certain neurochemical brain state that has, that doesn't go beyond that. And then it's like we can fall back on what we were saying. Everything you experienced isn't neurochemical brain state, right? That's what we are. That's what our brain does. Um,

Speaker 1:          01:56:55       so do you define it yourself? Like when you, when you do it, what do you think is happening? DMT, which is the most profound one

Speaker 7:          01:57:04       I think. Well, it's, you know, the problem with psychedelics, one of the, one of the problems that we experienced with psychedelics is they are essentially an English language bull. They're beyond language and you take dmt or something like that has such a profound impact. I mean, you probably noticed it in yourself. You're not even down from the experience before. You're trying to box it into some kind of a linguistic box that's, you know, and you're reaching out and you're babbling and then you're say that it, that's it. Or my God, my God, or you know, but you're trying to put it into some kind of a linguistic box because. Because it's in comprehensible by nature it seemed comprehensible. It's like trying to describe what God looks like it is by definition undescribable and so, but our brain wants to conceptualize things. So, uh, so whatever model you create of what it is, that's not it, that's not the thing. It's not what you experienced. It's a memory of, of what, of what you experienced. And uh, uh, I don't know how you get around that, you know, I think that, um, well,

Speaker 1:          01:58:30       I don't know. It seems even exploring the concept itself is almost impossible without the experience almost

Speaker 7:          01:58:37       possible. I mean it, I mean, so you're asking me to a supply, a description.

Speaker 4:          01:58:44       So I, with the caveat that any linguistic description is going to be an adequate, I would say a lot of what my impressions of DMT are. The most profound experiences are it strips away. You get to see the raw data, the raw data of experience in the unprocessed for, you know, how we were talking about how the brain takes experience and, and you know, puts it all together into some kind of a more or less comprehensible model. And extrudes out has, as you know, your reality, your movie, the movie that your producer, director and star of and uh, it does that dmt gives you a chance to kind of arrest that process. And again, as I said, step back from it and look at the raw data, look at the circuitry underneath free of interpretation and say, Oh, okay, this is the, this is the machinery. This is the machinery that generating reality. But again, by even saying that I don't do it justice. I mean it's, it's slippery obviously it's a slippery cock onset

Speaker 3:          01:59:57       intensely, intensely, and I, I've always wondered like what is the, if there is a way to describe it to someone who hasn't experienced and I don't think, I think there is, and even to those of us who have experienced it, you can't describe it after my memory, I had been tricked, like that's not anything like Terence Mckenna or Dennis Mckenna described it. What did, what was your experience like? No self transforming machine elves. Well, I'm thinking of of my first mushroom experience, but now my first dmt experience was. I mean it sounds trivial, but it was sort of like some sort of gingerbread or play dough that was alive and talking to me and just sort of one aspect of the godhead. Just sort of gingerbread or playdough. Yeah, it was sort of like alive gingerbread people I guess way it didn't look like an Elf but it.

Speaker 3:          02:00:54       And it kind of had that, that aspect. Yeah. It certainly felt alive like it had been waiting for me. Yeah. That's the weird thing to see me. Yeah. The weird one is the friendliness of it, but I felt dead. That was my overwhelming feeling was, oh no, I've really done it. But in the back of my mind I knew that I was coming back. I was still sitting in my chair and before I knew it, it was over and I was Doug Stan hope who's a good friend of mine is a stand up comedian. Did a dmt with me the first time you ever did it. I had them over my house and he went into convulsions, which I've never seen before. And W five meo and um, he, yeah, he started moaning and foaming at the mouth, like he was, like,

Speaker 1:          02:01:40       drool is coming out his mouth and he was going, oh. And I was thinking of the Qti from this shit. I've never heard of anybody that's fucked. I just killed my friend. Damn. How am I gonna explain this. And um, I've never, I've never seen anybody have that one

Speaker 7:          02:01:56       experience before or since. And uh, it was weird. It was, he was moaning, it was a big dose. He took a big dose and uh, you know, when he came back just for just filled with descriptions that were inadequate, you know, which we all are, but a five methoxy is even trickier. DMT, I don't know. I mean I've had very limited experience with firefox seat because it's too much. Yeah, I didn't, I didn't think I was coming back. That's my baby. That's exactly the one we should be looking into. I mean, I, you know, but it has more issues with toxicity and all that and to uh, but it's definitely puts you in this, uh, in this place to eat. You know, James horrocks book the trip to me palace. No. Oh, you should. You might want to get him on this show palace. James Orac. How do you spell it?

Speaker 4:          02:02:57       Oh, R o

Speaker 7:          02:02:59       I see. I believe five methoxy DM. This is all about 5:00 ctmt that's this whole book. Yeah. And he says you think DMT is something? Five methoxy is where it's really at. And I can't dispute that because frankly it scares the shit out.

Speaker 1:          02:03:22       It did. It was different for me because, um, it didn't give me the sort of comfort that dmt did, that it was sort of talking to me and communicating with me. It was completely absent of any context. It was impossible

Speaker 4:          02:03:35       play it. That's what it was. There were no, no friendly Elfin, no gingerbread people, no machines, no nothing like that. It was like, you were, you were. My apprehension was that was that I was part of this oort cloud of souls. I was a part of this somewhere somewhere if there's a place where all conscious entities arose from and go back to and I was in the center of this galactic cloud of, of being, you know, um, I mean I sort of had that diem awareness of my existence as a separate entity, but mostly I was part of this, the soul

Speaker 7:          02:04:16       all out and a is the best I can describe it, you know. And by the time I came back, uh, you know, that was, that was all completely faded as it tended to. That was, that was, uh, that was 20 years ago that I had that experience and still resonating with me. I haven't done it. Sam.

Speaker 1:          02:04:40       Yeah. I've only had it a few times and I didn't want to go back again. I was like, ah, I got it. I got that. Whereas the on any time, ethel trip to mean was a, it was different every time and it seemed like it was a communication, like something was talking to me. Like there was a lot going on. The visual aspect of it was way more compelling. Yeah. I did very little visual aspect with foxy was just white. Yeah. It was like, it felt like I wasn't, I didn't have a consciousness anymore is the only thing that I've ever done that seemed to eliminate consciousness. It wasn't, didn't matter. Like the vaguely aware the Dolly aware of the fact that you exist at all was one of the more terrifying aspects of it. It's like, oh, this is probably what happens when you die. When you die, you probably go into this thing and become whatever part of this cloud you are

Speaker 7:          02:05:32       community of over souls, which is every conscious being that ever existed anywhere in the universe.

Speaker 1:          02:05:39       It also gave me the most tangible feeling of there not being an up and then not being in down. There's no laugh. There is no right or as the whole thing, you know, and then you're part of the whole thing and it just goes everywhere. It doesn't, you're not in the middle, you're not in the center, you're not in the left, not to the right. It's just show the whole thing, you know, and you know, it's an illusion. And that, that was the weird aspect of the planets were an illusion that everything's a little wind, all of it. Nonsense. You're just a part of the whole, when you get down to the lowest thing, you're a part of the whole soup. Yup.

Speaker 7:          02:06:14       Yup. He thought that drug, he refers to a zero energy point feel, uh, which uh, yeah, I mean that's a definitely a, a worth putting on your map. And if you're brave enough or foolish enough, it's probably worth exploring. But I'm, I'm too old for that shit.

Speaker 3:          02:06:36       Right.

Speaker 1:          02:06:43       My friend Duncan took it and he took a huge dose because he didn't believe it was. He had never done any dmt before and he had done acid and I had never done acid before. And I was telling him about dmts. I even ever even done acid. So he takes a, he takes dmt in a big dose and he calls me up. He's like, what the fuck man? I'm like, I told you like, no, he didn't tell me. You kind of told me, but I didn't listen. Right. Holy Shit. Like he was convinced that he died. He was a believer. Oh boy. Was he ever. Yeah. Yeah. It was a, you know, it's a very disturbing. But again, impossible to ignore transcendent experience. You know,

Speaker 3:          02:07:22       it is. I think Salvia divinorum can take a person to a similar space, sort of. You feel that you're, you're no longer a point of consciousness except it, it doesn't feel like a cloud. It feels like a Mexican dance party

Speaker 1:          02:07:36       or geometric thing, isn't it? Because it slipped through that Salvia slip through and it took a while before people realize that slipped through. You mean legally speaking through because it's, its own best insurance against abuse. Most people are like, once there's enough, never again, one of these ones like five.

Speaker 7:          02:08:01       See, I mean most, some people do seem to be fascinated by it and they keep going back to it and, but most people find it very disturbing and not, not particularly enjoyable and actually just, just bizarro no. But again, these are areas, uh, of consciousness. These pharmacological tools are, are, uh, you know, their exploratory probes into these realms of consciousness. And just because you're familiar with the psychedelic experience, which is mainly the tryptamine mediated Serotonin, you know, dimension there all those other dimensions out there and are aspects of consciousness to Salvia divinorum happens to be the kappa opiates. You know, it's a kappa opioid like end. It's very selective for, you know, we don't think of opiates is going to those places, you know, heroin and morphine, those sorts of things. They're euphoric, gentle, you know, almost sedated states of mind kappa OPA eight, which is, you know, one of the three opiate receptors that happens to be the one that's Salvia divinorum exists.

Speaker 7:          02:09:16       It's a whole other ballgame, you know, I mean, it's not a, certainly not anything that anyone would seek out, you know, certainly not addictive, but so that realm of consciousness is mediated by that whole network. If you look at a, the tourist, the night shades, the anticholinergics that's working on Acetylcholine, Acetylcholine blockers, so that's a whole other neurotransmitter system. And if you look into, you know, the, I may have a long history of use obviously, and they seem to be, if you look into the use of tollway in South America to weigh a brick band, cea, or you look at detour for another night, shades in Europe. This is the realm of race and ghosts and that sort of thing.

Speaker 1:          02:10:14       Detour is a very interesting one too, because of the, uh, the reality desolving properties of it where people think that there's somewhere that they're not, and they have huge issues with memory. You think that's the disruption of Acetylcholine? Well, yeah, it does, it does disrupt memory. We know that Acetylcholine has a lot to

Speaker 7:          02:10:34       do with the entrainment of memory and detour, detour. It disrupts that. So it's hard to remember the state, which is probably a good thing because the states are really bizarre. Um, I tell people detour it a night shade. Detour is not a psychedelic, but it's a true hallucinogen in the sense that it's not a psychedelic state, but you have hallucinations. The problem is you can't tell if they're real or not. Usually a psychedelic hallucination, you know, it's not real. You may be seeing something that's not there, but there's a part of your mind that's saying this is a hallucination year. It's not there. You know, you see things on detour. You don't know if they're there or not there, you know, you, you, if I could, I could have a hallucination. I'm sitting across from you talking and you see ms dot real and solid as you do now.

Speaker 7:          02:11:32       You know, but you're not there. I'm having a conversation with you and then you sort of just fade away like kind of a wraith, you know, you sort of. I'm like, what the fuck? Where did you go? Is that what has happened to you have, you know, that's what happens. What happened to you when you did it? That's what happened. Like you were talking to someone. They were. They literally didn't exist. Yeah. Yeah. Well, I, I took a detour. I described this in my book. Actually. I have old chapter of it, a friend of mine and I took a detour up when we were 16. Not even knowing what it was. I mean this is how clueless we were at the time. I actually thought it was a kind of morning glory. I, I had had lsd once in my life and we took this detour it.

Speaker 7:          02:12:18       I thought it was a different species of morning glory. So all this stuff began to happen and I thought, oh, this is what a bad acid trip is. Like wow. And no, it's not what a bad acid trip is like. It's what a totally typical a detour. A trip is like. And it's characteristic that you see entities, you see things that are there. And uh, I was an and it was quite anxiety provoking. And uh, my friend, I was in my bedroom, I managed to, you know, you have to read the chapter, but I finally got to my bedroom, I barricaded myself in my bedroom and my mother was completely freaked out. What was going on? I just said, mom, how old, you know, I'll be out in 12 hours. 16. Oh, that's awesome. And so I'm in the bedroom and one of the weird things, I guess people who take detours should be for ward. One of the things that does this dilate your eyes, right? It's used medically to dilate your eyes. Atrophying is what they put in your eyes to do an eye exam. What means is your

Speaker 4:          02:13:32       eyes are dilated so you can't see very well. And, uh, so any modeled surface anything with a texture, like a table cloth or wallpaper, anything you're looking at starts to swarm and step. And the next thing you know, they're bugs everywhere. For me. So it was like the bug experience. There were insects, all surfaces were covered with these swarming, you know, things which were the visual distortions of not being able to focus on anything, but I was totally freaked out by this and, and so my friends or images of my friends kept appearing at the edge of my bed at the end of my bed and they would appear and I would say, help me, help me, get me out of here. I'd be, you know, and they would sort of just look at me and like, you know, you pour sand,

Speaker 1:          02:14:28       shake their head and then just fade away. That's awesome. It's fascinating that it has something to do with Acetylcholine. Yeah. Have you ever experimented with taking acetylcholine before you go to bed? Uh, I haven't. It's, it gives you the most amazing lucid dreams. Amazing Dreams. I'm not surprised. Fascinating what I called durable lucid dreams, right? Because I'm not a lucid dream. I'm like, I'm not disciplined in I, I've never studied it. I don't practice it. Apparently there's techniques that you can, you can learn how to successfully lucid dream on the Nash as it were, but if you take acetylcholine before you go to bed, like a couple of hours before you go to bed, you have lucid dreams whether you like it or not, they're just more. It seems like your dreams are more durable when you're aware. It meets me personally when I'm aware of my dreams. Normally they'd fade away like, Oh, I'm dreaming, and then it's gone. I wake up.

Speaker 4:          02:15:24       You're just boosting what's a natural process because when you go to sleep, your brain becomes flooded with acetylcholine and these detours, these, these troll pain alkaloids, what they do is block acetylcholine and they block the receptors, so their acetylcholine that called the technical term is anti-cholinergic. They block acetylcholine from binding to its receptor, so that's the basis of the altered state of consciousness and interestingly enough, the detour a state of mind resembles it resembles profound sleep deprivation. If you keep yourself awake for five days, you will have experiences and hallucinations that are almost indistinguishable from a state of deterrent intoxication. That's bizarre. I don't recommend it, by the way, I mean, don't do Detroit or if you do deterrent, have somebody there is looking after you because you really can't distinguished reality.

Speaker 7:          02:16:30       Um, you do silly things. Uh, you know, I had a friend who took the literal one time and he spent the whole time a dismantling his motorcycle engine on the floor, on his kitchen floor, taking it apart and cleaning it and putting it back together. He didn't own a motorcycle.

Speaker 8:          02:16:56       Oh my God. What if he learned how to do to do

Speaker 7:          02:16:59       it though? What if you gave a motorcycle engine is like, Oh, I've done this. And then he starts doing it all the other Uber Bizarre. What is that? Um, there's that drug that they use for, for air sickness. Same One. Scope. Paula. Me. Yes. That's the one. That's the same thing. That's Columbia Dental psychoactive alkaloid in detour and Bella, Donna, and this is the one that does it. There are other alkaloids, but it's primarily sculpture. And they used to use medically, they used to use scope. Paula mean because it's a for childbirth. Back in the days of barbarism when they thought women in order to give childbirth, give birth, had to be put in, it had to be drugged, you know, they use Capella mean to put them in a twilight state, like a hypnotic state of semi consciousness, and then they could have the baby, of course they didn't remember any experience, which was sort of the point, I guess.

Speaker 7:          02:18:05       How does nicotine fit in? Because one of my most intense, lucid dreaming experiences with, with a nicotine patch, nicotine has the opposite effect to the tropics. Nicotine is what's the trope? Answer what's called a acetylcholine antagonists. Nicotine is an agonist, so it has an Acetylcholine like effect, which is why when you smoke you get this sort of cognitive activation, you know, it's great to settle down and focus your attention on a task. It activates cognition. A lot of the research now on Alzheimer's and other dementias are finding things that either have this, uh, this, this colon, colon nurture jake, a agonist effect like nicotine, or they block acetylcholine from being broken down their Acetylcholine esterase inhibitors. Acetylcholine estrace is the insight in that breaks down acetylcholine. I don't smoke cigarettes, but I, um, I found it absolutely fascinating reading Stephen King's book on writing where he talked about when he stopped smoking cigarettes. It really affected his writing process. Absolutely. I'm not surprised she didn't, you know, didn't really fire up the way he is. That's right. Yeah. Yeah. So now we've again got off the track and we're off in the jungles of pharmacology.

Speaker 1:          02:19:34       No, it's fascinating. I mean, it's off track at all. I mean, it's all interesting because it's all in relationship to what we understand currently about compounds that affect the human body and what you're doing with the ethno botanical stewardship council is to try to educate people on these things, try to expand consciousness and awareness of these things and really just just promote it and put energy behind it. [inaudible],

Speaker 3:          02:20:02       part of it is education. It's developing a model of self regulation that can, can improve the safety of people that want to use these traditional plants. But one thing I want to be clear about is that we're ourselves not setting a standard per se. We're engaging people in dialogue, we're kind of setting the table for indigenous groups and people that run retreat centers, people that are selling Iowasca online, etc. All the people that are involved in the kind of value chain of iowasca to come together and determine, well, what is sustainability at the site level look like? Like ecotourism, how are you giving back to the community, to the biodiversity of the place where you're, where you have your site, how are you making sure that people in the ceremony are safe, that they're screen psychologically or for heart conditions. They're not tAking antidepressants, they have a people babysitting or watching, so people don't wander off into the jungle.

Speaker 1:          02:20:57       The antidepressants wants is an interesting one. What, what's the issue with that?

Speaker 7:          02:21:02       Well, the issue with antidepressants and iowasca is [inaudible]. Iowasca involves mao inhibitors, right? and so,

Speaker 9:          02:21:13       uh,

Speaker 7:          02:21:15       it prevents the breakdown of dmt, right? And the butt. And so there's a lot of dmt in your suit. It's a serotonergic agonist, right? And so are the antidepressants. So you are essentially piling on one sarah to nurture agonist on another cause you're inhibited. And the breakdown process, man is involved in breaking down both dmt and serotonin, so the, the safety wise, the issue is that it could lead to what's called a serotonin syndrome. And the serotonin syndrome is something that happens when you got too much serotonin, too much,

Speaker 9:          02:21:56       uh,

Speaker 7:          02:21:58       pushing the serotonin button a little bit too hard and it can lead to hyperthermia and a cardiac, your regularities and, uh, ultimately death if it's really bad, you want to avoid the serotonin syndrome if possible.

Speaker 1:          02:22:13       That's fascinating because that's also an issue that people have if they take an ssri and they want to consume tryptophan or five htp.

Speaker 7:          02:22:22       Exactly, exactly. That's also a one way to do it. And in some ways the psychedelic experience itself is kind of skirting this. I mean, you're, you're pushing the serotonin button, right? But in most cases with psychedelic you, you haven't inactivated the instamatic breaks that are, that are metabolizing this stuff. So It's not an issue with iowasca, it's, it's really only an issue if you're taking an ssri or if you're taking mao inhibitors, which most people, they're not used clinically anymore. there was a whole older generation of antidepressants that are mao inhibitors. You shouldn't, you shouldn't combine those with iowasca and you shouldn't combine ssrs with iowasca. The, that may be a theoretical hazard. There's, I haven't seen a lot of reports of serotonin syndrome happening with iowasca. Um, but so it's a theoretical hazard, but I'm sure there are people taking serotonin uptake inhibitors that are taking iowasca given there is no problem, but they're probably taking lower doses.

Speaker 7:          02:23:38       It's just a good idea to get off those things. Before you take iowasca, is it a good idea to get off those things, period? Yeah, I mean is if you can, if not for every day really helped some people, but yeah, but a lot of times, uh, you know, uh, antidepressants are over prescribed and overused for too many things. They don't, they don't really help people get to the root of their problems. They just kind of bandaid it over and you feel sort of normal, you know, and you can be a productive citizen and you don't really think about things too much. They're prescribed for ptsd, you know, but they don't cure ptsd. They just kind of dampen it down and bury it. They don't give you an opportunity, uh, to really, uh, you know, look at issues and work them through. This is why psychedelics or not a good model for big pharma.

Speaker 7:          02:24:39       Big pharma wants things like ssri, which you take everyday for the rest of your life. That's the business model. Psychedelics are things that you might take a few times and work through your issues and you don't need antidepressants. After that. I've talked to many, many people who said, you know, who have been on antidepressants. They go to south America, they take a few iowasca sessions. They never have to go back to antidepressants again. I mean, they can get off at for good. Many people have that experience. That's a huge problem financially for pharmaceutical companies as well. You don't see him pilate on exactly what they need to start selling iowasca yeah. Yeah. It's not gonna work that way because big pharma, they want drugs that people consume. I think the way that. I think one of the business model, you can't use these drugs in therapy in, in a therapeutic session without intense psychotherapy, whether, whether that's actual psychotherapy or shamanism or some combination of those things, these are drugs that have to be used in context, know the, you know, the take two and call me in the morning model doesn't work for these.

Speaker 7:          02:25:56       These have to be used in a very highly controlled set and setting. So I think where they, uh, where the business model come see it is you have places where people can go and get this kind of therapy. So it shifts from the drug itself. The emphasis is, uh, you know, uh, our whole biomedical industrial complex is set up to encourage bandaid solutions. You know, you have a problem, you go see your psychiatrist, he has seven minutes. If he's lucky to talk to you, here's the prescription, get out of here. You know, that's the way it works with psychedelic. He actually have to have a therapist who will sit down and talk with you. This whole novel concept and uh, you know, so I think where the business potential comes in is that to, to have centers of therapy where you couldn't go and get psychedelic therapy and the emphasis is more on the setting and the services provided than the actual chemicals.

Speaker 1:          02:27:00       Yeah. The setting and the, uh, the, the new this is possible in other countries where it's legal in America started happening in America right now. It's a huge issue. But josh was talking about selling iowasca online. I mean, how many people do that in? What's the Legality when it comes to the plants themselves are not necessarily illegal. Right? Right. Dmt is illegal.

Speaker 7:          02:27:29       Dmt is illegal, but dmt is found in so many plants that uh, you know, they, they can't really make all those plants illegal because, you know, I mean, they can, but they're not going to be able to enforce it. Then it's going to be able to have salad. Literally. You're not going to be able to have salad. I mean, I'm, you know, hearkening back to what we were saying about how close dmt is to tryptofan two steps away. I'll bet you, I mean, I, I wish somebody would do this, there's no funding for this, but I'll bet you if you had sufficiently sensitive instruments, you could find dmt in all plants. You know, you could just start randomly selecting them out of your backyard and run them through the mass spec or whatever. You could pick up dmt. Not in usable amounts, but it's universally just nature is drenched in dia.

Speaker 7:          02:28:25       Why do you think that is? Because it's so close to trip to fan, you know, and it's just the, the compound tryptofan is universally distributed. The enzymes that transform it to dmt have other cellular functions. So they're found in all cells. They're just part of metabolism and so it's just an accident of nature, you know? it's just, it's just the way it is. What a fascinating war. It's actually maybe nature's trying to send us on a little message if you want to interpret it that way, but it's just the way it is or it's just a part of the building blocks of the universe itself. Part of the building blocks of. Exactly, exactly. And that, that chemical doorway to another dimension exists in virtually everything that's alive. What a mind fuck that is selling iowasca uh, online. I don't know if uh, I don't know if people are selling iowasca prepared a iowasca bruce online are, seems to be the kid in a gray area. yeah. I think that's irresponsible because. Well, because it's a, it's a drug that needs to be taken and an appropriate sentence setting. It needs guidance. So to sell it online is to be guilty of that whole thing. Take two and call me in the morning, go off and do this with your friends. Well that's what went out in the operation and, and the any real knowledge. So that's, that's not ethical in mind

Speaker 1:          02:30:05       opinion. That's how five mio is acquired until fairly recently when I bought five. I mean, you know, I just bought it online. It's just delivered me enough to get the world high. yeah, I mean it was a little, I mean it, you realize how potent it is and what a small dose he need. And if they're sending you some giant supply of it,

Speaker 7:          02:30:24       well that's an issue with, with all of these things and the whole, you know, the whole designer drug thing, there are, you know, hundreds and hundreds of these things. So I sort of say, well, you know, we should stick with the plants. At least we know what the identity of that. But, you know, I mean, I think that, I mean, synthetic drugs are out there. People are going to use them. Uh, it's, uh, it, it comes back to education, to teach people how to, how to use drugs. Basically you have to teach people how to use drugs. This is what so called drug education has, won't quite, hasn't quite grok to, hasn't quite admitted, but that is in fact, that's real drug education, not, you know, all drugs are bad. Never take it. I mean, that's absurd. That's now you've

Speaker 1:          02:31:20       lived through several errors of psychedelic awareness. you lived through the sixties, you live through all that craziness. He lived through the seventies, you lived through the clamp down and now you're here, which is, I think it's safe to call this the psychedelic renaissance. I think this is. This is a new time when we'd like to think so I. I'm pretty positive. At least it isn't my reality there. The reality that I experienced, I mean I've never in my time seen psychedelics more reference than I see them today and part of it's because the company I keep part of it is because the message that I put out and the people that I interact with because of that, but I think also it's just a. It's just a matter of the cat got out of the bag. The stigma

Speaker 7:          02:32:03       is fading away. The whole sixties baggage that psychedelics have been have been marginalized with for so long that's going away and a new more positive perception is appearing as some of these therapeutic uses are becoming more aware in general consciousness. So ptsd can be treated with mds, mtma. We've got veterans out there who need that. That's a hugely powerful message and if the department of defense is behind it, it can't be bad.

Speaker 1:          02:32:38       Yeah. I mean, isn't that kind of ironic that the need for psychedelics has arisen from the war culture that we totally ironic, but so strange. There it is.

Speaker 7:          02:32:49       And so these positive messages are being hurt more and more and there's less and less a sort of, you know, partly because a lot of people from the sixties are dying off or whatever they don't remember, but the knee jerk negative message about psychedelics is not happening this month.

Speaker 1:          02:33:11       Yeah. There's, they're much harder to distinguish now. The folks who use them then the hippies with the beads and the, you know, the, the, the look which was so stereotypical of what, you know, the goldwater republicans found reprehensible about that generation. They were lazy, shiftless do for nothing. People that just wanted to get high and escape reality and that, that, that paradigm that, that perception is passing. Yeah. That's all to the good. What has it been like for you to experience these different waves?

Speaker 7:          02:33:47       Well, uh, I don't know. I haven'T really been personally impacted by this, this thing, you know, I mean, I've been where I've been all the way through and not particularly public. I'm much more public now about it than I have been. So I may, maybe that's a difference. Uh, but I don't feel that I have to be careful about talking about it in public. I mean, I'm, I consider myself an advocate for responsible use, you know, and good science. And I'm not even saying people should even take these things take, you know, what I'm saying is that if you decide to take it, go into it with open eyes, do some preparation, pay attention to set and setting do it in a way that, you know, if there are benefits to be had maximized the benefit. So approach it as a conscious, a conscious exercise and uh, you know, um, and, and, and approach them with respect and in intention. These are serious thing.

Speaker 1:          02:34:55       What do you say to someone who has zero experience and he thinks I'm gay. I guarantee you right now this podcast is reaching people that have no psychedelic experience whatsoever. They don't know anyone who has had any psychedelic experience. They don't know where to turn or where to start, but they're very intrigued and the door's been open to them.

Speaker 7:          02:35:15       Well, the first thing to do is get yourself educated about it, you know, like sign up for this symposium. I mean watch the online thing, but there are many other tools. Uh, another group that I love to plug and I think they're doing a marvelous work is erowid.org. It's online. It's the best online source of information about psychoactive drugs, of all kinds, not just psychedelics. It's the go to place on the web. If you want real solid information, not bullshit, not put out by the propaganda put out by people who, whose commitment is to accurate information. Start there. It's fantastic. Read about it. There are trip reports, there were safety reports that chemistry, the, you know, the, uh, the field botany, the part of it that the shamanic traditions, it's all represented there. That's the place to start spelling out to for p, r o w id erowid.org.

Speaker 7:          02:36:19       Go there and read up about it. Educate yourself before you take the substance so that you can make an informed decision, uh, what's an appropriate method of use? Uh, what are the right circumstances? What are the hazards? What do you not want to do? I think that's the first thing. And I, I think, again, I think this symposium, a conference is gonna be great, but it's also exemplary of what needs to happen. And I'm really impressed that, you know, young people like the folks that are organizing this conference or are stepping up to the plate and saying, we want to make this a part of education, an educational dialogue. We want to have this happen on lots of university campuses. Lots of places. That's the thing we have better now than

Speaker 4:          02:37:16       we've ever had for sharing the information. Take advantage of those tools. Uh, you know, before back in the sixties, seventies, you might not have had no experience with psychedelics and no real, uh, you know, no way to know how am I going to find out about these things. You know, now it's a click of a mouse and you're there, and now there's no excuse for not educating yourself.

Speaker 3:          02:37:44       Another very good site is ice [inaudible] dot org, I c e r s the international center for ethnobotanical ethno botanical education research and service based in europe. They have a ton of information about iowasca boga, the plant based psychedelics. There also a sort of incubation partner for the esc, helping esc.

Speaker 1:          02:38:07       Ibogaine is another fantastic drug for dealing with addiction. Uh, I have a good friend who had a back injury and got hooked on pain pills and had a real problem and really couldn't kick it. Uh, wenT to Mexico, did ibogaine, became completely fascinated, cured, and absolutely fascinated by obligation. And how is this possible that this is escape? Western medicine started his own. Um, I became a center down there and now, you know, regular. I mean, he's just a different human being. When I talked to him, he's just so at peace and just, it's a different guy. He knows himself in a different way.

Speaker 3:          02:38:44       [inaudible], it breaks that physical addiction to opiates. Instantly the esc is of signing a memorandum of understanding with the global ibogaine therapists alliance to work on the safety and the sustainability of that traditional plant. It's under extreme pressure from the growing global demand. It's traditionally from africa and it takes seven years for a mature plant to be grown and then you have to take the root out and you kill the plant. So, um, there's a lot of Work to be done. Um, there's a, a global ibogaine therapist alliance conference in durban, uh, this may as well we're hoping to have some big announcements come out of that on the sustainability front.

Speaker 4:          02:39:29       So many things came out. Again, it was, it never went away. It was always there, but it a, you know, it was suppressed essentially in western medicine. I mean they had a perception that it had no place. There were almost clinical studies approved by the fda and then they stepped back from it because of some supposedly neuro toxicity, which I don't think they ever satisfactorily demonstrated. But that's a good example. You know, the therapeutic community was saying, well, I gave is so useful for this addiction therapy that we're just not gonna put up with this. and so I began as not illegal. It's illegal in the states, but it's not in most of the world. So these addiction treatment centers have blossomed all over the world. There's Mexico, south America, even Canada. There are treatment centers that use ibogaine to treat addiction and they've just said, well, you know, fuck the fda, we're going to step outside that framework and do it because it's important to get this therapy to people and that's all to the good. I think that's a model maybe for what's going to happen with iowasca.

Speaker 1:          02:40:43       Yeah, I would hope so. And I would. I would like to see what's going on right now with marijuana in this country. Slowly started happening with iowasca, ibogaine, psilocybin, all the, all these various things. Um, do you have hope for that?

Speaker 3:          02:40:56       Totally. I do. History is on our side. And first thing I'd tell people that are considering psychedelics is put your preconceptions aside and just look at the facts. What would you say that

Speaker 1:          02:41:07       someone say, look, we're talking about young people. What if a guy's 50 and you know, maybe he's going through a rough divorce and uh, you know, I was like, man, this fucking I need to reset my brain. I need to figure this out, but I don't know anybody. Nobody at the office knows anything about this stuff.

Speaker 4:          02:41:26       Right? Well, a smoked a joint in college. That's about it.

Speaker 3:          02:41:32       Take it in a traditional context that you feel comfortable with. Take it in a. If you're looking for psychological help, maybe take it at a center that focuses on that if you want to, if you've always been attracted to shamanic experiences, then suss out which centers might be best for you and read revIews of them. And in two to three years the esc will have a rating system or kind of star rating system for sites based on how sustainable they are, how safe side psychedelics is. Not so much a yelp or a deeper level than a yelp because they can't fake it though you can't take it, but it's hard for somebody going in to see what kind of an impact a center has on the local community or where they're sourcing the iowasca come from, comes from and that's where we're, the esc is bringing that professional expertise to, to supplement what the community is doing. Um, and certainly we will rely on feedback from visitors that will be part of the credibility and the transparency that we're building into the way of assuring the sites are sustainable and safe or be grievance mechanisms. If you have a bad experience,

Speaker 4:          02:42:41       hopefully in five years, five, that's probably optimistic timeframe, but hopefully in 10 years they'll be places you can go and have these experiences where you don't have to leave the country. I mean, you can already find them outside the country, but it would be nice if there were places in the states where you could get this and it would, it would transform a psychiatric medicine. Uh, if there was, which is again, threatening to many people with a stake whole estate

Speaker 7:          02:43:12       in how it's done now, but I talked to so many, um, psychiatrists, other professionals that are involved in the mental health world. They're very frustrated. They're like, say these people are hurting and the way that we're handling them is not solving the problem. It's only making it worse. Um, so, you know, there needs to be a wholesale, I wouldn't say overturning, but transformation of the model. I, um,

Speaker 1:          02:43:45       I think that we're on the right track. I really do. I'm, there's a lot of people that are cynical today and they look at today's culture and they look at the toxification of our environment and the materialism and the nonsense on television. They see it as a bad sign. But, uh, I really feel like civilizations cramming. Yeah, I really do. I really think we're just scrambling to try and maybe we need something like all this nonsense that we experience on a daily basis to sort of really motivate this, this global awakening.

Speaker 7:          02:44:15       We have to consume it to the extent that we're sick of it, that it makes us sick, and then we purge the iowasca bottle. We consume so much of it that eventually you just regurgitate it all and you feel much better afterwards. You know? Yeah. I think that's partly what we're doing.

Speaker 1:          02:44:36       I think the most exciting thing too is that we have a way out or we have a way up. Whereas like it's not like we're in this pit and there's no ladder, like there's a fucking lie. Hey, we have, we have the tools. I mean, and they're incredibly profound and real, you know, these aren't theoretical things like, you know, we have a lot of these theoretical concepts about like fixing the plastic in the ocean. Well there's, you know, some 19 year old kid figured out a way that there's a machine. It scoops it up. Then it converts it into something usable. Then we could use that for energy. And the same thing's true with nuclear waste. There's some theories about how to. But those are all. Those are theoretical. They may or may not be effective. They may or may not ever get built. The ladder is not be in your life right there.

Speaker 7:          02:45:23       Let's, you know, I mean, in respect to that, we look at this dire existential situation, the environmental crisis and all that. I take heart in the notion of never underestimate human ingenuity. You know, there are a lot of really smart people working on all these problems and that's my hope, you know, for our survival, I think that the ingenuity will prevail. I hope so, because otherwise we're in. I mean, we're already in deep shit. The question is how do we, how do we dig out of it? And uh, it, it, it, you know, that's why we have these smart brains, you know, we're not going to get there by being stupid. We've had of that and there's still plenty of it to go around and. But we need to move beyond that, you know, stop listening to a lot of people, like our politicians, for example, who seemed to make a profession of stupidity and they're actually proud of their stupidity.

Speaker 7:          02:46:27       And that's distressing in any way. In what way do you feel like that would be like sarah palin mean people like that, you know, the science deniers, the people that, you know, I don't, you know, don't bother me with your fucking facts. You know, my mind is made up and you know, when god told me this and you know, this is horseshit. I mean, come on, you know, clear thinking at least should be a criteria and if you want to be a politician, not somebody who's, you know, a buying into some, some myth from the 14th century. I don't necessarily even think most of them are buying into it. I think what they've done is realize that there is a market for that. There's just a gigantic chunk of the population is terrified of change, terrified of the possibilities, the unknown, the intangibles. And they would like something norman rockwell, they would like you to paint some really clear and easy to recognize a pattern that they could see.

Speaker 7:          02:47:24       Jesus, thank you jesus. You know, and they just jumped. The lord has blessed me in so many ways and they just fucking locked themselves in this box of perception. And then politicians come along and they go, oh, that guy, I know how to fucking play his heartstrings. Exactly. You're part of the problem. You're not really helping solve the problem. You're taking advantage of what these people, what I think even karl rove called useful idiots. People that want simple answers, I call them simple answers for simple people. Hey, get over it. There are no simple answers, you know, and what we need to be doing this looking for the real answers, asking the hard questions, realizing that it's solve very complicated. There are answers, but we're not going to get there through delusions and fairy tales. You know, we've got to actually acknowledge and start thinking about this and start talking about it to other people in a real way. So sarah pailin these people in these mushrooms, they're idiots. He's iowasca. She needs a dmt trip that she needs a head with transplant. Yeah. Fuck yeah, she would, she would, she would realize that she's right and wrong at the same time.

Speaker 7:          02:48:38       Mind blown. And um, okay. So the website, uh, for uh, for the ethno botanical stewardship council, it's ethno botanical council.org and the, um, the symposium is spelled sim like as in psychedelic p, s y symposium 2014. It is April 12th and 13th in amherst, Massachusetts. Listen folks, you've got to make it the upside of this symposium.org

It's moving in, I think a good direction. I really do

Speaker 3:          02:49:47       one last plug if I made. There's a congress that I'm going to next weekend in Mexico to luca, a bringing together indigenous leaders with a boga, a pod, mushroom, a iowasca experience, and they need funding to attend to bring more of the, the traditional healers to that conference. It's called the the second international congress on traditional medicine and public health, sacred plants, culture and human rights.

Speaker 1:          02:50:14       And is this information all available on ethno botanical council.org? Can you. Can they find it there? No, but I'll change that in the news section. So what the hell? What the fuck? Come on man. We're all working together on this kitchen. Say it. Well, I'd like to say joe also, thank you for having us on and you, you my friend are one of the change makers for sure. Don't underestimate that. I mean you're, you're a hero of my. Oh, that's a huge honor. I'm a useful idiot. What I am is a no idiot. I'm a repeat or have things that are fascinating, but I appreciate that very much and I feel as compelled, as all of you to try to broadcast as much of what I've stumbled upon and, and talk about it as much as possible and it's impossible without guys like you. So thank you all. Thank you very much. Thank you everybody listening to thank you for having us thank you to the list or we're all in this shit shit together. People.
