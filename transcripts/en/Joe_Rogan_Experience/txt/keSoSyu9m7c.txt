Speaker 1:          00:00:01       Okay,

Speaker 2:          00:00:08       boom, and we're live. How are you? Welcome to the show. I'm doing great Jeff. Thanks for her rehab. Close. There you go. I know you've done a podcast for. You did Tim Ferriss podcast. I heard you on that. Actually three of them. I think I did for three. Three really cast. Oh, I need to listen to the other two then. What is this one you brought me? Man, this is crazy. That is. Do you think I'm a drunk? This is what. This is. Maybe the dry farm wines. Guys think that this giant magnum. I'd have to have a party. It's a, it's a wine that's pretty legit in regards to if you want to stay on a ketogenic diet. And a, I tested this in my office actually and just found that to be. It's non glycaemic for one thing, which means it doesn't impact the sugar content is so low. There's not an elevation in blood glucose and uh, I can stay in Ketosis on this one if I do one glass two or three. Three starts to kick me out. But to glasses of wine, you can completely stay in Ketosis.

Speaker 2:          00:01:10       Most glasses, most wine will kick you out of Ketosis. Uh, yeah. I mean it's highly dependent on like a merlow. A dry wine typically doesn't, but a smart little more dry, uh, most of it, yeah, most of the time. Yeah. A white wines tend to kick me out more. And of course something like a sweet wine, we'll go bowling or something like that. Really sweet. Uh, St Maria, you know, that'll take you out very fast. Just sugar. And even beer does, even though it's supposed to be low carb beer tends to kick me out. Really Michelob ultra and maybe one, you know, one or two. But other than that, yeah, I mean I get that question a lot so it actually got me interested in studying this so I can answer some of the questions with some level of knowledge and after testing these wines and uh, I came to the conclusion, yeah, you can drink two glasses of wine a day on a strict ketogenic diet.

Speaker 2:          00:02:05       And I think this is important for people that are doing it to manage their health long term and um, especially people with actual health issues were ketogenic diet, ketogenic diet benefits them, like epileptic. Absolutely. Like when I got into this, it was a pediatric epilepsy like in 2007 or eight and now the applications are expanding, you know, a dozen or more. So we hold a conference and Metabolic Therapeutics Conference where the top tier people in academia and like from Johns Hopkins, they probably one of the spearheaded ketogenic diet application clinically and a top tier scientists from Yale and Harvard and other places, uh, present here. And it's, I think the applicate it was like 11 or 12 applications for the key to genic diet where there's good peer reviewed research to support the efficacy, uh, as a metabolic based therapy for a number of everything from, you know, polycystic ovary syndrome to acne to rare.

Speaker 2:          00:03:08       Even genetic disorders like Angelman Syndrome is something that we're studying, a, it's a, it's a genetic disorder where a housekeeping gene is mutated and it results in seizures and a motor function impairment and the ketogenic diet is remarkably effective. Uh, not. It's really drug resistant seizures that these kids have, and even in the presence of a persistent molecular pathology, a genetic pathology, the key to genic diet, uh, through altering metabolism with the Diet, you can largely silenced the pathology and the motor function impairments associated with this disease. And that, that's amazing to me that you have a disease that is persistently there due to a genetic mutation and you can largely silence the symptoms that is yours

Speaker 3:          00:03:56       in the interest of addressing people that are probably on the ground floor. And I feel like there's very few people today that don't understand what a ketogenic diet is, but just in case for people who don't know, there are people that use carbohydrates mainly for fuel. And then there's the mutagenic diet which makes your body run on fats and ketones. So try just kind of explain that to people, like how this came about. Um, how people started to, uh, researching this and how you got involved. Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:04:28       Uh, I mean this goes back to if not centuries, millennia, you know, dating, back to the time of hypocrisy when it was observed that fasting was a quote unquote cure for seizures and with the observation. Yeah. So fasting puts you into fasting Ketosis, right?

Speaker 3:          00:04:45       So even intermittent fasting, like I do the 14 hour thing where I, 14

Speaker 2:          00:04:50       hours, you know, that's, that's clinic. I mean technically that's kind of, I call that semi a semi fasted state when you achieve that, you know, when you're eating breakfast, it could be 12 hours or more a you've eaten last and you're breaking the fast essentially. But with severe epileptic patients, uh, it was found that when you, when they restricted food and in some cases water after about two or three days, you had profound seizure control or it silenced even the worst seizures. And this was observed, uh, you know, for Millennia, like I said, and uh, the, there was some work done in the, the early 19 hundreds and 19 twenties. Uh, there was some work done at the Mayo Clinic that I observed the presence of these ketone bodies and people that were eating a carbohydrate restricted diet that was primarily a based on eating fat and with a minimal amount of protein just enough to ensure there's not protein malnutrition.

Speaker 2:          00:05:49       And it was observed that there was an elevation of ketone bodies, Beta hydroxy butyrate acetate in the blood. So they called it a physiologist called it the key to genic diet. Uh, even technically, maybe Beta hydroxy butyrate is not a ketone, but physiologists called these ketone bodies, Beta hydroxybutyrate acetate and acetone, and it mimics the physiological state of fasting in many ways. So if you were to draw blood off someone on a ketogenic diet, it would sort of look like they had been fasting a few days, uh, because it's mimicking the way I think about it. It's suppressing the hormone insulin and kind of mimicking the fuel, the substrate utilization that you would be using in a state of being fasted, which is primarily fats, ketones. And, uh, to a lesser extent a of, I mean, a glucose from amino acids from protein. You are mobilizing some gluconeogenic amino acids from your skeletal muscle when you are fasting.

Speaker 2:          00:06:45       Ketones are protein sparing though, so they are anti catabolic in that way. So because we make ketones and our large brain has a massive demand for energy and the ketones fulfill that for the most part. When fasting, uh, it prevents us from breaking down muscle. Uh, it prevents us from liberating the gluconeogenic amino acids that would otherwise be chewed up and use to maintain our glucose levels. So the ketones sort of replaced the glucose. The brain has the metabolic flexibility to adapt from using glucose to using primarily ketone bodies in those ketone bodies really have a protein sparing. Anti catabolic.

Speaker 3:          00:07:22       No. Is this an ancient system that was in place back when people, you know, obviously couldn't go to the store and your diet varied depending upon what was available and it just allowed people like say, like maybe inuits that lived off a lot of fats because they really don't have many carbohydrates. If you're living off a whale blubber and things along those lines like they had to back then.

Speaker 2:          00:07:40       Yeah. Uh, I mean it's hardwired in, in humans and other animals. My, my wife Studies Manta rays and uh, and they, they're the, like the Einsteins of the sea that, so they're the fish with the biggest brains of all animals and we've done metabolomic studies on them and looking at the blood and they produce a significant amount of ketones, like two millimolar, uh, they dive really deep so it may help protect them from that. So yeah, animals will go into ketosis during fasting or even if you manipulate their food source, uh, the Quito pet sanctuary actually treats dogs that have cancer and they implement a key to genic diet in dogs, uh, in addition to some other things to help. Uh, and the many of these are our dogs from kill shelters and, and put them on an anticancer therapy program and they can get into ketosis for the most harder.

Speaker 3:          00:08:33       But most of them, most dog food is not kidogenic is like documents have grain in it, right? Yeah. For fillers and things along those lines.

Speaker 2:          00:08:40       Yeah, it's really interesting. I was talking with, uh, Ron Pena, uh, yesterday, uh, from quest nutrition. The CEO of quest nutrition and he brought to my attention that if you look on a package of dog food, you won't see carbohydrates listed even though it's the primary because there was some laws or policy put into action to prevent carbohydrates from even being listed on kibble on dog food, which I find, you know, there's a lot of reasons why mostly because dogs really shouldn't be eating a carbohydrate based diet and that's probably part of the reason, but there's sort of other reasons why a. But it's really important that the. So the food that the Quito pet sanctuary gives the dogs that have cancer and they confirmed that they have cancer with a, a glucose pet scan and they do it, you know, before, during and after is basically kind of like a raw foods key to genic diet that's almost completely restricted in what we've called glycemic carbohydrates.

Speaker 2:          00:09:38       Things that would elevate the glucose levels and it's very high in fat, relatively speaking. Yeah. But dogs, you know, really should not be eating any grains at all. Yeah. I feed my dog grain free dog food, but I don't know if it's carbon free. I don't know what's in there is a kibble kibble. It's hard to find out. Right? Yeah. Uh, I mean, you know, dog food that has a, like some peas and sweet potatoes and things like that. It is. Okay. Uh, but ideally, you know, you want to give your dog like a whole food nutrition just like humans and you know, they say don't give your dog human food, but that's, there's no evidence for that. And uh, you know, I've given talks where I talked about giving dogs raw food and there was a, there'd be a reaction from the audience while it's dangerous to give your dog like raw food or what do they in a while, you know, I mean if the, if it's ground beef that's been sitting around at a processing plant for a while yet maybe, but fresh, you know, a meat from a butcher, fresh meat.

Speaker 2:          00:10:38       I mean, it's probably the ideal thing for a dog. Ideally, organ meats like liver, heart, kidneys, things like that. Grind it up. Uh, you know, and some, some Greens tos and things like spinach you can buy like spinach powder. So the Quito pet sanctuary has an ebook that's completely free if you go to Quito, pet sanctuary, a.org, I believe, and you can download the Ebook and it tells you very precisely how to make your dog food not only to, to, you know, if your dog has cancer, but to maximize its overall performance and you are preventing cancer by virtue of putting them on a diet that optimizes your, their metabolic health. Well that's got to be very difficult to package though. And something that's sort of evergreen. So it's on the shelf and paper bag. You can rip open and just pour into a bowl.

Speaker 2:          00:11:25       That's what everybody wants, like this convenience thing, but there is a way to do it. And uh, you know, I know, I know those guys, you know, epigenics a foundation, they, uh, are, are working. They basically support the Quito pet sanctuary and they're working out not only the macronutrient ratios that need to go into the food, but also the types of food and also being able to package it in a way to ultimately come up with a food that you can go. It may not be on the shelf and probably ideally shouldn't be on the shelf, but it will be like in the refrigerator section of your pet food store. So you go there and like for our dogs we get like a tube of freshly ground up, a steak or whatever. And we feed that. We take the ground me and mix it with Oregon, me and mix it with a different greens, Broccoli and things like that and give it to them.

Speaker 2:          00:12:14       And they love it. We put a little bit of coconut oil on it sometimes. So you would go to the grocery store or it would be, could be shipped to your house. And it's basically kept refrigerated and it has the compliment of like organ meats to, you know, the proper types of fats, a official hill, fats and fiber. And um, and it fits that macronutrient ratio, the ketogenic diet dog was horrific farts. One of them that, yeah, we have a great Dane. They're both rescue dogs. Uh, one of them does Broccoli, organ meats and coconut oil. I'm like, Whoa, go room. Yeah, it's either my wife, uh, or uh, the dog, I don't know. She might be blaming the dog, maybe blame the dog. They're healthy. How long have you been involved in ketogenic research and research on Keto diets? And, and how long have you been doing it yourself?

Speaker 2:          00:13:08       Yeah, I guess it was. I got turned onto it in 2007 or eight. And, uh, actually I was communicating online, uh, on a nutrition forum on a fitness website. And uh, I was a neuroscientist. I did my phd on cellular neuroscience. I didn't let something called patch clamp electrophysiology where I electrically record from neurons and it was, you know, really, uh, mostly just neuroscience and my postdoctoral research was studying seizures and uh, I got to the point where we're doing some drug based research on seizures and other types of research and the types of seizures that I study are powerful tonic clonic seizures that a navy seal could potentially experience using closed circuit rebreather. So when they're underwater, a limitation for their time underwater is cns oxygen toxicity and it's also limitation for hyperbaric oxygen therapy, rebreathers or those ones that don't emit bubbles. Is that correct?

Speaker 2:          00:14:05       Yeah. So there's a bit of a stealth component, so you're underwater and if you're going over a lake to uh, engage the enemy, they can't see you coming. So that's the advantage that they're very, um, stealth, like a, the disadvantages that at 50 feet of seawater in just 10 minutes, you have the potential to get cns oxygen toxicity. Of course, if you follow the guidelines and dive within the guidelines, uh, of you know, the depth and the time, then you're typically okay. 90 nine point nine percent of the time, but if you have, you know, a, uh, someone shooting with a 50 caliber machine gun on, into the water, you're not going to want to come up, you know, you're going to want to stay down there. If you have a mind to go down to the bridge or ship or something, you have to likely, in many cases go down below 50 feet and it puts you at the potential of having a seizure and a seizure under water.

Speaker 2:          00:14:56       The seizure itself is not a, a deadly per se, but having a seizure under water could be fatal to the mission and in, you know, the warfighter. So, uh, my research was really developing various technologies where we actually put things inside of Microsoft, uh, inside a hyperbaric chamber, like an atomic force microscope or a laser scanning confocal or we can look at the Mitochondria under pressures that simulate these operational conditions. And, uh, and that was about 10 years ago, and out of that research evolved studying various things and looking at the cells and even the Mitochondria and observing that ketones essentially enhance brain energy production. And resilience in extreme environments of high pressure and high oxygen. And from those cellular studies, uh, I became more interested in what people do when drugs don't work for epilepsy. And I looked up and found the ketogenic diet and uh, this fits in perfect because my background was studying nutrition and I was studying pharmacology at the time, but it allowed me to bring nutrition back into my research program, uh, and studying the ketogenic diet specifically.

Speaker 2:          00:16:05       And the program officer at the time at the office of navy research really liked the idea of the ketogenetic diet and a drug. So being able to consume something that can elevate these blood ketone levels which can cross the blood brain barrier and make our brains kind of super brains under physiological extremes. So that's what I really. I put my efforts into studying the ketogenic diet and also into developing and testing a wide range of exonerations ketone products and which come, which are on the spectrum of drug like to, on the spectrum of kind of natural based things that can be combined together that put you in a state of therapeutic ketosis within like 30 minutes to 60 minutes so you can use it right before an operation, a for mission or therapeutically. So if you have a child, for example, that has status epilepticus, which is continuous seizures that you can't stop instead of giving them an anti epilepsy drug that can have side effects and even developmental delays.

Speaker 2:          00:17:07       Uh, the Ketogenic Diet, you know, it takes 24, 48, maybe 72 hours to work, but if you can tube feed them a, a, a ketone supplement and put them into therapeutic ketosis, then you can mitigate these seizures which could have potential longterm effects. So that's just one example of a therapeutic application of exogenous ketones. But, so you're doing the research on this and you decided to start doing it yourself? Yeah, I started doing it myself to get a better understanding. Actually the, there was a patient in in the UK, his name is Mike Dancer, and if you just kind of Google Mike Dancer and epilepsy, you'll come up on his story, which is a really remarkable story because he tried a dozen, half dozen, maybe even a dozen different types of antiepileptic drugs and high doses, things like Keppra, like things that are the standard of care and it didn't work for him.

Speaker 2:          00:17:58       He connected with me and I, I mentioned a couple supplements before I embarked on the Ketogenic Diet. And long story short, I gave him the information kind of here's the key to genic diet. Here's a scientific rationale. It looks like before you go and have brain surgery, they were going to remove part of his hippocampus. Well, uh, I said, you know, just use this as a, maybe about 2008 or nine ish. And a long story short, I didn't talk to them because they got really busy. I transitioned into a tenure track assistant professor position. I was working very long hours, maybe four months or so, went by, and then when I contacted him he was like, I have not had a seizure in this time and he was having multiple seizures sometimes per day and couldn't leave the house and it was almost like a proof of concept and it also caused pretty significant body composition changes in him and he was in the fitness industry and even did a bodybuilding show.

Speaker 2:          00:18:47       So he basically was, it saved. It saved his life actually because he had what, what I would call and what the doctors called terminal epilepsy. There was no way to control seizures and when, when the drugs failed, the ketogenic diet worked for him. And that was almost like proof of concept I'm reading. I thought the qg Hank Diet was kind of like this fad diet. I just knew about it in the fitness circles is something that I would actually typically avoid. But when you read about the history of the Diet in the 19 twenties, early 19 twenties, and how Dr Wilder kind of developed this therapy, uh, at Mayo clinic there's like really legit. A peer reviewed research behind it and enormous amount of research and I realized it was a grossly underutilized, you know, mega bought what I would call a metabolic based therapy for seizures.

Speaker 2:          00:19:37       Why would you typically avoid? Because they're in our healthcare systems, there's really not the infrastructure when a patient comes in and uh, and they have uncontrollable seizures. The neurologists or epileptologist typically does not have the skillset in nutrition knowledge in nutrition to be able to guide a patient successfully into nutritional ketosis and to do that so they would have to refer them to a registered dietician, which typically are not savvy and ketogenic diets. Uh, but, uh, but now the Charlie Foundation is a foundation that worked closely with Johns Hopkins and I think there's about 150 to 200 clinics worldwide, uh, that are key to genic diet clinics that have, you know, registered dieticians that are working to assist patients. So now, you know, uh, the infrastructure is kind of there, but doctors typically will prescribe a drug whenever they can. And even when they know they may, most of them are probably aware that, you know, it is the standard of care, a drank diet is a standard of care when, when drugs fail and there's things like vagal nerve stimulation and other things.

Speaker 2:          00:20:43       But the ketogenic diet has been around so long, it has an amazing track record. There are some side effects associated with it, mostly associated with a classical Kj Diet, which was like 90 percent fat, eight percent protein. But now, uh, Eric Kossoff at Johns Hopkins has done a lot of work on what I would call the modified ketogenic diet. He calls it the modified Atkins Diet, which is more liberal and protein. It's 20 to 30 percent protein and the balance being mostly fats from healthy sources and the carbohydrates are just, you know, completely non glycemic carbohydrates you'd get from salads or green vegetables and things like that. And what are those side effects? Uh, so with the classical Qj Diet, they found that kids put on the Diet it a reduced igf one, which if you're into longevity, that's, that might be a good thing, right? Uh, and it reduced their terminal height in some cases because of the protein restriction.

Speaker 2:          00:21:37       So restricting protein can, uh, for reasons we know in the longevity field, you know, uh, reduce, uh, igf one signaling insulin, igf one signaling, and that was found to be the case in kids versus the suspected mechanism. But when protein was titrated back in, uh, that was not the case. So there's also kidney stones can happen and there was a supplement potassium citrate that can help kind of offset the mild metabolic acidosis that occurs when you go in the ketogenic diet and just simply, I mean, you could do that nutritionally just by formula in your diet and using more salt, uh, to balance out and using more minerals. So actually the big issue was just the protein just yeah, I think the protein and for kids that are growing and developing and uh, and if you restrict protein and kids that have all these growth factors and everything that really kind of require a.

Speaker 2:          00:22:31       and also if you go on the Ketogenic Diet it, you may be inadvertently limiting total calories just because of the palatability of the. Especially the classical Qj Diet, whereas the modified Atkins Diet, which was studied very rigorously at Johns Hopkins by Eric Kossoff, has shown to have like 90 percent of the benefits of this draconian, a classic ketogenic diet and a when possible, you know, it's better to put. And that's what I follow. I follow a modified Atkins, which is just higher in protein. So let's, let's establish the protocol. So the step, the classic Ketogenic Diet is 90 percent fat. Eight percent protein, two percent carbs. Is that what it is? Uh, that's about the macronutrient ratios. Yeah. And they call it a clinically, they call it the four to one or the three to one ketogenic diet. And that's really confusing because that four to one is in grams, right? So it's a, it's actually like four parts fat to one part protein and carbohydrates, carbohydrates being very, very small part of that one, that four to one ratio.

Speaker 2:          00:23:35       And if three to one ratio would be, and that would be like 92 percent fat, I mean it's really high. And then the three to one ratio is like 88 percent fat or close to 85 percent fat. So I like to do it. It's, it's, it's, it's better, it's more, it's more easy for me to consider in terms of percentage of calories. And um, and about 75 percent calories from fat is pretty doable and pretty palatable. So that's how you do it. Yeah. Sixty five to 70 percent if it's super important for people, uh, not only in the clinical realm, but also people that are doing this, you know, for athletic reasons, for losing body fat, managing type two diabetes is probably the biggest, the low hanging fruit of all these applications. And I can talk more about that. Uh, the biggest thing to do is to count your macros and test your ketones of course.

Speaker 2:          00:24:26       But people are horrible at counting how many calories they are getting in when you tell them to follow a diet. So they really need a, a, a, an APP, a software program, a, an APP, and a Avatar. Nutrition makes the kind of gold standard app for tracking your macros. And I'm working with them hopefully to develop, it's called avatar nutrition. That's the actual app name that is the APP name. And that's a, it's a very highly innovative, a app that not only does it, you know, you put in your macro has, it's a macro calculator, those, that macro nutrient profile is in the system and you do body composition measurements a weekly and it calculates through what I would call an artificial intelligence system and ai system in the algorithm to, to adjust your calories week by week based on the progress that you're making.

Speaker 2:          00:25:24       And uh, and it's the only system that I know of. It's kind, that's a, like a macro tracking system that also gives you feedback on how to titrate your calories and your macros over time to hit specific body composition changes that you want to get. And this is the system. It's the ideal platform to, uh, incorporate the ketogenic diet into. So it's gonna take some work with the, you know, the guys that are writing software to design it. But essentially, you know, you'll have available a key to genic diet app that we'll be able to adjust to whatever output that you want, whether it be managing seizures, uh, maybe a metabolic management of cancer or, you know, body composition changes or performance changes over time. And that's all being written up. Now. I've got a bunch of questions. First of all, what do you, what, what, what are your primary fats like when you, when, when you tell someone that your diet is, I mean, forget about the classic 90 percent fat, but even 75 percent fat people just go.

Speaker 2:          00:26:26       Jesus, like where? Where's all that fat coming from? Like what you, what do you use for fats and do vary it. Yeah. Um, my, my dad is pretty. I get the same 12 to 15 foods probably pretty much every week. My wife kind of eats outside of the range of the Ketogenic Diet. So sometimes, or she. Yeah. How dare she? Uh, I don't try to pasta in front of you and mock you a she does, but I don't crave it. So that's the thing. And she thinks it's really strange. I mean, Italian, I am, so that created a bit of a problem with my family, like when I go home, yeah, I was up on pasta so you might. Carbohydrate tolerance is actually really good. So if I go back to a higher carb diet, uh, you know, I can't throw in three, 400 grams of carbs a day, but I tolerate it very well.

Speaker 2:          00:27:12       So me going into a ketogenetic diet was a very strange thing for me to do that. Uh, I had read Robb Wolfe's book and knew about the Paleo Diet and uh, and even, uh, some, some of the writings of Gary Taubes, but I was a little hesitant or skeptical about about it and skeptical. Well, I really thought that you need carbs to grow in the gym and maintain your strength and uh, and performance. And I just felt that the brain needs glucose for fuel and I didn't, you know, I was kind of unaware of the research that was done in Harvard in 1967, uh, by George Cahill. And I did get a chance to talk to him for a pastor. Rob Wolf is, you know, rob is really into Jujitsu, right? He's having an issue with maintaining a strict ketogenic diet. I don't know if he's going with the classical ketogenic or the modified Atkins, but he has a problem with having the, the carbohydrate restriction when he has really hard training days.

Speaker 2:          00:28:09       Yeah, I would to, I, I've talked to rob about that a little bit. Uh, the body is incredibly adaptable to switching fuel sources and adapting to that fuel source over time. And some people may be a little less adaptable than other people, but I think that if he was to give it a, I think you knowing rob, he did give it a very legit shot. He may benefit from adding some slow carbs in just prior to an intra workout. During what's up? What do you consider a slow carb? Uh, you know, there are supplements out there, but yeah, if we're going to talk about, uh, I would say yeah, maybe a little bit of sweet potato in, you know, prior to training or the day before, maybe a few hours before. So it's some sort of a car with a plenty of fiber or something like a digest slowly the idea, even a high molecular weight, carbohydrates that are on the market now, what are the, um, you know, I don't use them anymore.

Speaker 2:          00:29:03       I know Jeff Bullock has a product out, uh, you can, I think you can. Starch is the name of it and it just, uh, you know, it will slightly elevate your glucose and not trigger an insulin response so you won't go hypoglycemic after and it'll just, you know, essentially, you know, titrating carbohydrates and glucose into your system over a predetermined period, you know, so they know that you're a, it'll kind of hit your system and sustain it for three or four hours, which is ideal for people engaging in, you know, a, a, an, an, a or cycling during that, during that timeframe. But I think, I mean if you're getting in a sufficient amount of calories and if you are using things like creatine monohydrate, which knows where you work through the foster gen system, you are able to generate atp for those short bursts of power that you need to manage your opponent and sustain it.

Speaker 2:          00:29:59       So for a supplementation, if we're going to stop my creatine, would you do that prior to the workout? Would like know a lot of people take creatine, postworkout? Yeah. I just, uh, you know, if you're tickling pre attentive. Yeah. And you stopped taking, created it's in your system for, you know, a couple of days to a week or more. So it's just, you know, on a daily basis doesn't matter necessarily when you take it. It's just that you take it on a and probably at least three grams per day for a larger guy at three to five grams per day. Is that something you take a, it's one of the few supplements that I take. I only take maybe three or four supplement. I used to take all these different supplements so I'm more of a food guy. Uh, but maybe I'd take three or four supplements and they use some of the new food products that are coming out on the market now, a junk food products and that allows me to maintain my kid drank diet when I'm traveling.

Speaker 2:          00:30:50       Do you ever mess around with Beta Alanine? Yeah. Uh, it's something I use to increase a carnosine levels, right? It's something that I used in the past. I don't like the tingles that I get a lot of people like to tinker with them and it's not quite that extreme. It's like Niacin, but it's working through a different receptor. Yeah. The first time I took notice and I thought I was going to die, but yeah, it's unpleasant. It's not something that, you know, some people look forward to it. I don't know, those people are strange, but the Beta Alanine is a good. Makes me uncomfortable. But I remember drinking on the way to the gym. It was part of my preworkout formula. Um, and it just made me itchy. It's didn't like it. And you know that the data's not dance a little bit. It's not. I wouldn't, it's not what I would call compelling, but it looks like it may offer a benefit.

Speaker 2:          00:31:39       It was just recommended to me. That's why I brought it up. So you're creating three grams per day and what do you that up to 15, something like that. What? He was on the mark. I would go to the. I lost some weight or yeah, that was like almost almost exactly. So I had a couple of weeks ago I got down, I did an a mission with NASA and I was underwater for a while and when it came back up, how long is awhile? Uh, I was under for 10 days, which is Christ. That's more than a while. It makes me an aquanaut yeah. Wow. That's crazy. So, and during that time, during the training for it, I was doing a lot of swimming, which was a, I sink like a rock. I'm kind of negatively buoyant and so it took a lot out of me and I tried to get into my file that I was like closer to 200.

Speaker 2:          00:32:24       I think maybe you'd be more likely to be an astronaut candidate for your, like lower weight and space is a big thing. Has Been. So I tried to get my body weight from 2:26 down to two. Oh seven. And I did it, took about three months and now I'm creeping slowly back up. I'm down. And what did you do to do just high aerobic workout restriction? I did intermittent fasting. Really just transitioned to a diet where I typically to a ketogenic breakfast that's kind of small and I would made that a little bit smaller and two or three days out of the week, um, on average I would just kind of naughty until dinner and then I would eat a substantial dinner and then maybe do some activity after that and then kind of nibble at nighttime, maybe an hour or two before bed. And that was kind of my routine.

Speaker 2:          00:33:09       So almost like a warrior diet type deal. Pretty close to that. Yeah. From what I know that that's pretty close to that and I did not in any way feel deprived of food and that's really, you know, people who follow a low carb diet or ketogenic diet, they think you don't have to count macros, which was like the biggest mistake. They think you just go on this and you don't have to count calories, but you really do. I mean you could sit back, you could sit down in front of the TV with like a bag of cashews and I can Polish that off pretty quick and you could do a lot of damage. Like that's a lot of calories. Yeah. It depends on the kind of foods that you're eating. Two handfuls of almonds I think is like 500 calories or something. Yeah. That's like, that doesn't even make sense.

Speaker 2:          00:33:47       Yeah. So I talked to people who follow the Diet and they're like, the huge one diet doesn't work for me. I got on it and I gained like three pounds and I was like, well, what was your calories? What was your macros? Oh, I have no idea. I don't. I was told I don't, I'll have to count that, you know, that's the most important thing. So this is the function of the APP I told you about Avatar, which is kind of a macro counting program. Uh, right now you can set the adjustments to do low carb, but uh, the, once the software is written up to, uh, for the Quito option, that will be a tremendous resource for people. The average person that wants to do the occasion Hank Diet and hopefully we're going to craft it in a way to, to, to help the, uh, the clinical community too.

Speaker 4:          00:34:30       It's one of the reasons why I wanted to have you on is because you're an actual scientist and this is, there's so many misconceptions when it comes to ketogenic diet, at the benefits, the problems associated with it. And there's a bunch of people that. One of the things that I've found really fascinating is recently because the ketogenic diet has become so popular, there's been these sort of sparsely educated meathead trainer type dudes that are pulling the ketogenic diet. And whenever I see that happen, I go, oh, here's a person whose ideas are threatened and you know, like whenever someone says the Ketogenic Diet is not beneficial or it's not really worth it, I'm like, okay, but you're not saying anything like where's the science like point to something because there's a substantial amount of science that shows the benefit of the key to genic diet. But there's a lot of meat heads that are, that have been critical of it.

Speaker 4:          00:35:22       And when I, when I read that, I'm like, okay, you're not saying anything. Like there's no substantial reason why you're critical of it. This makes me think that you have been pushing a certain type of diet for a long time. This comes along, it shows contrary evidence and trying to diminish it in some sort of a way, but without any actual science. So what have been the criticisms of the Ketogenic Diet and how many of them are actually valid in terms of when, when what I'm talking about when I'm talking to people, especially if I'm talking to professional athletes, I'm talking to athletes who's very health is very critical that they have energy, right? We were talking about fighters. So for them like to recommend a ketogenic diet to a fighter, it's very tricky because we, you're talking like one percent, two percent performance could be the difference between victory and defeat and maybe even being knocked out or submitted and being successful.

Speaker 4:          00:36:15       Yeah, so I think most important people need to appreciate that when you transition your body from burning carbohydrates and glucose and forcing it to rely primarily all fat and ketones for fuel or not. It's not one or the other, but you're shifting for the predominant fuel source to be fat and ketones. And that's not happening. That's not something that happens like overnight and it doesn't even happen in two or three weeks. So what I've seen in elite level, cyclist and and other types of sports is that it really takes a minimum of three months, ideally six months and even after a year I think you're getting a changes even at the epigenetic level. We know that ketones function as a signaling molecule through histone deacetylase activity that it's actually turning on genes that are causing adaptations in our body and these, these happened slowly over time.

Speaker 4:          00:37:10       The more you follow the huge hank diet, the easier it gets because there's a learning curve to to implementing it, but the more you follow it, the easier it gets and the more benefits you derive from it over time and those benefits really don't start to emerge. The benefits that that I'm thinking about after about two or three months and you're talking about benefits on a cellular level, not a performance from a performance level, a minimum of two months, like your performance will go down. So you have to accept, I mean this is something that voters would have to do in the off season. Athletes. I was stunned at how much of an impact it had on me. I mean, I mean, how fast were the benefits? Well, the benefits of the weight loss was pretty, pretty significant. Pretty quickly. I lost a few pounds within the first week or two, whereas I'm pretty active and it's not, you know, it didn't change much other than that.

Speaker 4:          00:38:03       Um, but what I was amazed at like the Keto flu, you know, what people call the Keto flu. Did you get that dragging for the first week or two? Like I was just dry and I would do a hard workout. I was like, oh my God, I don't know how to keep doing that. Yeah, okay. That's like a big one was hitting the bag. That's what I would really feel it because uh, you know, I do rounds or I'll, I'll set, you know, like a, a certain amount of rounds, a certain amount of time and that's when I can really feel the difference from day to day and I'm just really struggling. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:38:36       And how long did it take you to adapt to that? Or did you adapt to that?

Speaker 3:          00:38:40       Like A, a month in? It started to

Speaker 2:          00:38:43       normalize, but I mean that would be consistent with the literature if you're looking at cyclists and if you're, you know, a number of different athletes, it takes about six weeks. I mean your performance will go down and then start to creep up back to baseline at, around the six week mark and if you adhere to it strictly and really stick with your training, you know, in the 12 week mark you could be breaking new pgrs depending on personal words. Yeah, yeah. Non personal records. And that's primarily directed to a, I would say endurance athletes, ultra marathon athletes to cyclists who runners too, you know, iron man athletes. Uh, and the thing that had merged out of all the emails that I get people sending me blood work and their performance measurements is that I used to think it was about a month or two. It's more like three months to six months when they really start hitting their stride because I think there's pretty profound changes when you, when you alter the fuel that you're giving your body in such a profound way.

Speaker 3:          00:39:42       Well, one of the first things that I noticed the benefit, one of the first benefits was cognitive clarity, um, lack of fogginess towards the middle of the day, the no desire to take a nap and no a note drop. Like, you know, I would have the, the big meal thing and then the drop the valley when you know, like, oh, your body's digesting everything. And people. I thought that was just how you lived. I thought there was no getting around that. That's life you eat, then you get sleepy. I just, yeah, I didn't think that there was any other options going on. A ketogenic diet completely changed that. And when I would tell people about it, they're like, nothing. I'd be like, I'm telling you, there is no difference. I mean I would eat a meal and go throughout my day and then it'd be like 4:00 in the afternoon. I'm like, where's this crash? The crash is supposed to be here. Like, where's it coming? No crash.

Speaker 2:          00:40:32       Yeah. Same thing with me. Uh, I mean looking back at an Undergrad when I was like task loaded with a lot of classes and stuff I would make, I was trying to bulk up at the time and I would, I would put like steak or beef on a Bagel so I would cut a Bagel kind of in half and put like meat and stuff. So I would be getting all the carbs from the Bagel and I would just go get a big starbucks coffee to, to mitigate that crash that I would have. And now, so the key to genic diet when you eat a meal, it essentially, if it does not abolish, is significantly attenuate that insulin response that you get. So if you, you know, where something like a continuous blood glucose measurement, like a dexcon or something, and you look at that and you eat a, a standard American diet, you see a big spike in glucose, typically in the postprandial glucose, that'll be hypoglycemic.

Speaker 2:          00:41:20       And when you do that, not only does your mental and physical performance crash, but you crave food so that we'll send you, searching, sending you, running to the refrigerator. Again, to seek a reward, to mitigate that, that dysphoria, I would say that you get from the hypoglycemia, so when you on a Ketogenic Diet, you essentially abolished that you don't have this spike in glucose which spikes insulin and your. Your energy levels are maintained in. The big thing is cognitive. So the cognitive resilience is is a big thing. So even if you're hypoglycemic, you could like use something to lower your blood glucose, insulin and push it down to a level that would put someone into a coma and if their ketones are elevated, they are asymptomatic. For hypoglycemia, and this was a study actually going back to the work done by George Cahill at Harvard where he fasted subjects for 40 days and he did a battery of cognitive tests and he measured blood going to the brain and blood coming away from the brain.

Speaker 2:          00:42:18       And he determined that about 70 percent of brain energy metabolism is derived from ketones when you're fasting. And the same occurs with a ketogenic diet too. So you are literally switching the fuel source that your brain is using. But in an extension of the study, he injected to 20, I use of Insulin and pushed glucose down to one millimolar, uh, which is universally fatal and everyone, so you take a crowd of people are eating a standard diet and push it down to that, they'd, they'd all die. So none of them died in the study. I have no idea how they got it passed the Irb, the ethics review in Harvard Medical School. But they did. What year was this? Nineteen 67. And it was a steady. I became completely fascinated with because I couldn't believe that they did it because you can't even do it in animals nowadays.

Speaker 2:          00:43:03       You know, the IOC committee of the Animal Care and use committee would, uh, would put a stop to that very quick. You know, they probably sent the investigator out of the university if they propose to do some of the studies that were done. Uh, but what they, when they lowered blood glucose down to that level, which would put someone into a coma, the subjects were asymptomatic for hypoglycemia because they, their brains were keto adapted. They had essentially been over a week and in a fasted state, they were all kind of heavyset. They were divinity students, uh, and a few, I think we're Harvard medical students, so they tend to be overweight. So there, there were liberating a lot of fat from the adipose and making lots of ketones and they were in a state where their brain was tremendously resilient against hypoglycemia because their ketones were elevated. And that has practical implications for so many different.

Speaker 2:          00:43:51       And I was reading this and couldn't believe what I was reading. I called George Cahill. We talked about it. I called all these old time, you know, physiologists that were in the field just to pick their brain. And they were like thrilled that a young guy, you know, just entering ag, a tenure track position was going to like kind of make this as career goes back a ways. But I saw all the implications, not just for epilepsy but for things like Alzheimer's disease, traumatic brain injury, and uh, a whole host of neurological disorders. Like there's one in particular called Glucose transporter type one deficiency syndrome or glut one deficiency. And the kids that have this literally have a deficiency of the glucose transporter on the blood brain barrier and their, their blood glucose is normal, a normal levels, but the glucose in their cerebral spinal fluid is under a two millimolar, which is, I mean, their brains are essentially living in hypoglycemia.

Speaker 2:          00:44:44       So they're constantly having seizures. They can't move a lot of them. They're confined to a wheelchair. You put them on a Ketogenic Diet, uh, many of them wake up, they start walking around, their motor function is reversed. So it, the key to genic diet restores brain energy metabolism in these kids that can't use glucose as an energy source with this disorder, it's called Glucose transporter type one deficiency syndrome. And another very interesting example of a disorder where there is a persistent molecular pathology where the symptoms can be largely silenced with the, the application of a key to genic diet that needs to be pretty strict. And that's where ketone supplements come in. So I was, you know, one, it's, it's difficult for some of these kids to follow occasioning diet. So like a ketone supplement can potentially circumvent the dietary restriction. That's needed for kidogenic diet and make it easier for parents and kids to implement, but I also think that a ketone supplement can just further elevate ketones if you're on a ketogenic diet and further augment the therapeutic efficacy of the ketogenic diet or performance enhancing efficacy. So my main application is the warfighter and maybe astronauts do a. So we just think of it as a way to augment further, augment a therapeutic effect or a safety effect when it comes to divers or performance effect when it comes to the warfighters are diverse.

Speaker 3:          00:46:10       Now when you, um, excuse me, when you, when you talk to people about mental performance, have there been studies that have shown any variation between, uh, the same individuals on a Ketogenic Diet or carbohydrate, glucose based diet in terms of mental function?

Speaker 2:          00:46:29       Not good studies and not really good. So what Ha has been done? Uh, I mean the first study I would say purely key to genic study that I'm aware of. Use something as simple as medium chain triglycerides. And uh, it was actually a substance that the chemical name was ace 12. Oh, two. And that substance is in the patent list as a substance called AC 12. Oh, two for people unfamiliar with mct oil, coconut oil. Yeah. So if you were to pull this patent, uh, interestingly, Mike, my colleague and friend, Dr Mary Newport did and wrote a book on Alzheimer's disease about the use of, of ketones for Alzheimer's. Uh, she identified that the ingredients in this supplement that helped to enhance cognitive function in people with mild cognitive impairment. The, the ingredient of this, if you dig into the patent, was caprylic triglyceride, which is a medium chain triglyceride, mct oil.

Speaker 2:          00:47:26       And they did a study. It was a double blind controlled study that showed that people who interestingly they were not apo e four positive, that group did not respond. But, uh, which is another kind of pathway we can go down, but they, their improvement in cognitive function correlated with their elevation and ketone levels with this supplement. It was a fat that when you consume it independent and the amount of carbohydrates you consume, it converts that fat into Beta hydroxybutyrate, which you can measure with a little blood meter and adds that level creeped up and it didn't even have to creep up that high. It was like point six that they were getting significant improvements in the mini mental status test and other tests that are sort of like the standard test for Alzheimer's disease. And that really got me interested because I knew that levels could go up way higher than point zero six and they're showing that there's a correlation as ketone levels rise up, uh, that you have a proportional increase in cognitive function.

Speaker 2:          00:48:26       So I'm thinking with a ketone ester or other types of Ketones, you could elevate that to one, two, three and four millimolar and then get some really robust because that's sending a lot of energy to the brain. So every millimolar of Beta hydroxybutyrate that's in your blood could it's been estimated that it gives you, like your brain, about a 10 percent boost in energy. It can restore energy up to up to 10 percent. If you look at a, if you do a, an fdg pet scan and um, and a ketone pet scan, so you do a dual imaging for that. Dr Steven Koonin in Canada has done some, some work on that, but that's insane that it was so, like for

Speaker 3:          00:49:08       college students or someone who's studying for an exam or someone is about to do something very important. I'm exogenous. Ketones should be like standard,

Speaker 2:          00:49:17       right? Well, uh, yeah, there's some pretty good evidence to show, but is that especially if you have a deficit, right. So, uh, and actually, you know, the application that I'm using it for is in an extreme environment when your brain is already at a deficit. Uh, but we could say we're at a deficit, right? So tomorrow I'm jumping on a red eye and I can't sleep on a plane and night land, you know, and go to my university where I have to teach for a couple hours and then drive a couple hours north and give another lecture at night and I'll be on zero sleep. And I would not even attempt that if I was, you know, wasn't doing what I have been doing. Like I've kind of figured out protocols where I can allow me to function even on extreme lack of sleep. So build the motor through it.

Speaker 3:          00:50:00       I'm sorry to interrupt, but. So when you land, so what would you immediately take some sort of an exotic as ketone, some sort of what, what do you take? Like what are you, ketone supplements? That's

Speaker 2:          00:50:08       a lie. There's a wide variety of ketone supplements on the market. So I'm kind of a food guy so I just used them a almost kind of sparingly, but I do tend to use them every day. Uh, the supplements that I've packed my bag are. The key genex supplement is one that I'm a ben using and also the Pruvit Keto os product that mixes Beta hydroxybutyrate salt with mct powder. So there's a couple other forms of just Beta hydroxy butyrate, but our studies show that just consuming Beta hydroxy butyrate does not give you, at least in the, the ketone salt formula, does not give you a lot of the benefits that we see in some of the studies that we're running and the Beta hydroxybutyrate needs to be mixed with medium chain triglyceride fat and that's pretty important and I think that that has a number of benefits.

Speaker 2:          00:51:00       The medium chain triglyceride delays gastric absorption, so, uh, it also further boost ketone levels higher than you could get with ketone salts alone. So you get an elevation of ketone levels that sustained for longer and that probably that sustainment is due to kind of delaying gastric absorption because the fat kind of delays the release of the ketones into the blood stream. And it also, it's stimulating your own ketone production. So you're taking a fat right? And that's what happens when you mobilize body fat. You have a wide variety of enzymes that convert that fat into ketones. If you take a ketogenic fat, the same thing is happening. You're revving up that system in addition to the exogenous ketones, so the, the pruvit product, Quito as a key gen x and, and there was a couple other companies emerging on the market. We have our own company, a ketone technologies, and we are partnering with government agencies like Department of the fence, Onr, NASA to do research to fund research with these institutes to really nail down the optimal formula, uh, for antiseizure affects the optimal formula for a motor function, affects the optimal formula even for strength.

Speaker 2:          00:52:09       And the one was strength will probably involve, you know, adding amino acids, adding creatine monohydrate. So these will be formulas that will be optimized. So our company is working on that. We don't have any products yet, but if you sign up for the newsletter, we, we will update people on the newsletter. And then when the products do come out in emerge, you know, we'll kind of let people know. So when you, when you say you're a food guy, are there any foods that you can eat that will sardines, sardines? Yes. It's, I, I travel with a, this trip it was canned chicken and sardines. So there's a couple of wild planet makes a good Ken and Tim Ferriss, I kind of turned him onto it and uh, it really exploded the company, like kind of emailed me and thanked me, you know, they're really exploding. So it's a small company.

Speaker 2:          00:52:55       They do wild wild planet sardines and they're packed and olive oil and there might be, depending on what you buy, like a little bit of lemon, they might have a slice of lemon or lightly lightly smoked or whatever, but they are really, really good. And uh, I mean I look forward to eating them. Uh, for me I'm kind of weird. Like that is a treat for me. Uh, and that's, you know, I've taken a lot of different things and experimented with a lot of different things and simply just eating sardines. Like it's like the perfect food and eggs to are the perfect food. You asked me like where I get my fat from A. I do get a lot from the olive oil that are packed in this already. And so I eat a lot of fatty fish, lots of egg yolks. I will make an egg yolk omelet and I'll give the whites to my dog for protein, you know, cause they need a little bit more protein, so I'll make an egg yolk omelet and I will cook it in butter and um, you know, maybe make some asparagus on the side, like cooked in butter.

Speaker 2:          00:53:51       So I get a lot of fat from a macadamia nuts, a few nuts, sardines, fatty fish, a lot of salmon and a lot of egg yolks and fatty cuts of meat. So we go to the butcher and particularly pick out fatty cuts of meat. And I'm olive oil, coconut oil, mct oil are all things that we have you. Have you ever had issues with Sardines and heavy metals? No. Um, I think heavy metals are more of an issue with larger predatory fish. Like, I mean, I think swordfish would be kind of at the top of the chain there. Uh, of course, you know, you're eating like a Maaco shark or something like that and you're going to be ingesting. And if you do that on a daily base, I wouldn't want. If you're a pregnant woman, you know, I would stay away from big predatory fish, but one thing about sardines is that they can be farmed in a sustainable way and uh, the, the amount of heavy metals will be typically proportional to the size of the fish and whether it's predatory.

Speaker 2:          00:54:51       The reason why I'm asking this is I was eating sardines like two cans a day for a while and I got my blood work done and there was like a very trace amount of arsenic and my sister arsenic and the doctor said, what are you eating? And he was going over to different things. I said, I eat a lot of sardines. Do you know where it came from? Those out the sardines? Yeah. No, I don't know, just whatever was on the shelf. I mean, we travel all over, we're in Borneo and uh, you know, Malaysia and Indonesia and all these places and you see some, some boats coming in and those sardines are going to various plants. So, and even bigger companies, you know, we'll source out wherever, wherever is cheapest. Uh, so I like to be pretty particular about, especially if I'm going to eat something in such a high volume like where it's coming from to actually visit the plant and where it's coming in and get some information to where it's coming from.

Speaker 2:          00:55:45       A, you know, we, I do use some of the meats from the butcher box, so butcher box offers a wide array of, of meat from grass fed animals and, and that's, uh, a lot of our meals at nighttime are, uh, from, from butcher box. Uh, but that's interesting about the arsenic, you know, arsenic can, uh, get concentrated in the ground where plants are grown in. So, uh, if, if rice is grown in, in China or whatever plant is grown in China and that, that soil has arsenic in it. Uh, I lived behind our house, we had like a peach orchard and apple orchards are notorious for this, for having high levels of arsenic just based on the chemicals that were used over time. And uh, so this is something to consider. Maybe it's something you were eating with the sardines or maybe it was a sardines itself, depending on what's already into reading.

Speaker 2:          00:56:38       Have the nutritionist was pretty convinced that with sardines, want to cut them out in one way? Yeah, he was saying that it was probably just from pollution. Yeah, it could be. Yeah. I mean that's why it's really important to pick out, you know, where your food's coming from. This company you recommend wild planet. They're fantastic coming is doing the farm in this audience. Uh, yeah, they have. There's different methods that you can use that uh, would kind of put you in the category of sustainable farming for sardines. So it's one of the few fishes that are really low on the spectrum of, of having heavy metals and things. So if you're, you know, there's women. I get this question a lot like, you know, if a woman becomes pregnant, you know, should they stop eating fish? Who did they stop eating, you know, a Ahi tuna, swordfish and things I would say.

Speaker 2:          00:57:24       Yeah, definitely the big predatory fish you'd probably want to cut back on. Um, I did take a couple courses in neurotoxicology where we went over, like mercury poisoning and, and every possible chemical and, and just the take home message was a for the normal person, probably not an issue. Um, you know, unless you're consuming really high levels. In, in Grad school I was eating these big cans like 12, I think there are 12 ounce cans of tuna fish and there was like five servings per can and I would eat like three cans a day. Like I would take that and add, I was fat phobic at the time that it would be a chunk light tuna now to put balsamic vinegar on it. And I would literally eat three of these 12 ounce cans a day and that would be 15 servings of tune per day.

Speaker 2:          00:58:09       And I did that day in and day out. And uh, no ill effects. Uh, well I never got tested at the time. So nowadays I tend to do a lot of blood work just to check different things. Uh, but no overt signs of toxicity or anything. Uh, maybe like a little someone, one of the professors that I was doing something for, she had or her friend had lost a lot of hair due to eating tuna that had high mercury and at the time like Kinda had a lot of hair loss at the time, but it was also kind of a stressful period. So maybe when I stopped eating I noticed like, this is back in my mid twenties now. I haven't had a significant amount of air loss since, since, uh, uh, and a couple people, you know, and that actually that's one of the symptoms to have mercury toxicity.

Speaker 2:          00:58:51       We are tingling and feelings like kind of neurological effects. So just something, something that you consider a, but getting tested is probably a good thing to do. I've heard that from people that just consumed ridiculous amounts of Sushi. Yeah. But I would, I would imagine like Sushi or dealing with smaller portions of the actual fish itself, it might be, if you do that day in and day out, it's probably good to get tested and sometimes may not show up in the blood in the serum. You might have to look at the red blood cell because sometimes you know, some of these metals are more reflective of the levels on the, on the red blood cells or the hair too. So there's different ways that you can. You can measure it. I read that you eat. Was it candy oysters as well? Yeah. Yep. It's something I usually bring it thought.

Speaker 2:          00:59:37       I think I brought on this trip to like candy oysters, King Oscar. There's a few brands out there that I kind of vetted out things and oysters are really rich and a lot of micronutrients that could, you could get depleted in, on the Ketogenic Diet. So B, 12 is something I do supplement magnesium to be 12 insulation from Ketogenic Diet. What would that come from? Well, you know, it could be due to a sources of b 12 that you're kind of eliminating through food choices on the ketogenic diet. A, b, 12 was basically an animal based. Uh, yeah. Pretty much. Yeah. And I've, I've never met or I think I did measure that once and it wasn't. But people have reported to me that it was the thing that showed up on my blood work was lower on the low end of magnesium and I was getting cramps at the time and that's the only you asked about side effects.

Speaker 2:          01:00:30       So the only side effect that I experienced was cramps at nighttime, always between three and four in the morning and it would start in my foot and then start to creep up to my cab and, or if I did like legs or something, sometimes my hamstrings. And then when I, the magnesium supplementation a really prevented much of that. Have you ever used an isolation tank? No. One of the cool things about her is that you get my museum to the water. That's right. Yeah. Because the water's filled with a salt and the salt is magnesium and I don't know, I think there's, there's pretty legit a science behind that. I was a traveling in, um, in Israel and I went to the Dead Sea, which is really high in magnesium and it has a calming effect, uh, which is reportedly due to the very high magnesium levels and other salts that are in there.

Speaker 2:          01:01:22       So that magnesium is relatively small molecular weight that anything with a molecular weight like under three, 400, I think can, can get into your bloodstream. Yeah, I think that's why people like those epsom salt baths. I think that's one of the things that relaxes people. Yup. Yeah. And epsom salt bath is, you're talking about a very small amount of salt in comparison to a tank which has my tank is a thousand pounds of epsom salts in it and 11 inches water. So because you're so buoyant, you just need to do this daily at your house. No, not daily, but whenever I want, because it's in my basement, I just go down there and get into it, but it's a, the relaxing effects. It's pretty profound. That's interesting. You know what it brings to mind? Most of the. I've had at least a half dozen emails about doing epsom salt baths from als patients because als is associated with a chemical called glutamate, which is excitatory amino acid transporter and high magnesium levels can kind of, some of the cytotoxic effects of high glutamate and they were there physically patients that they get and twitching muscle twitching that they get and they found that, you know, dosing magnesium or these epson salt baths, you know, higher and magnesium can calm them down and, and also maybe mitigate some of the twitching that they had, which is probably a reflection of a glutamate induced neurotoxicity.

Speaker 2:          01:02:46       So the cells are dying, they're releasing. So maybe neuroprotective in that way. And it definitely, you know, I know magnesium, you can feel it. Like if you take a legit source of magnesium that's bioavailable, like magnesium glycinate or, or other forms of magnesium, you can really feel kind of a calming effect. Has know it makes sense. A lot of people take it before they go to bed. Yep. Yeah. But the, uh, the tank is, it just wouldn't get out of there. Your whole body just feels relaxed. I mean, I think part of is because the zero gravity effect of floating, you're floating like you're, you're very buoyant, right in this because the water, very heavy rail, like the, like the, the Dead Sea, like only maybe a third of your body is kind of floating in it, right? Or half of your body, half your body essentially like your ears are underwater where your faces above water.

Speaker 2:          01:03:31       It's amazing. You got to try it. I'm a big proponent of it. But, um, the, um, als, is there a benefit in the ketogenic diet to, for people they'll off? Yeah, that's another application. Uh, there's a guy Dr Pasinetti and I think he's at a and Mount Sinai in New York. Uh, he's got a couple of studies on this looking at caprylic triglyceride, which is a medium chain fatty acid and he also, prior to, that's a clinical trial I think is ongoing now. But prior to that he demonstrated in a mouse model of, uh, of als, which is the sod one gene, 93 a mouse model and it has a gene defect that mimics the familial form of als. Which accounts for maybe about 10 at most, 20 percent of als a pathologies. And he found that a ketogenic diet, a improved motor function and some neurological scores.

Speaker 2:          01:04:25       It did not improve overall survival though. So we actually followed up on that study with a therapy that we call the deanna protocol therapy after Deanna to don't. And uh, her father, uh, Dr Vinson to don't observe that his daughter responded remarkably well to, if you supplements, which was our Janine Alpha-ketoglutarate, uh, and a Gabba and a coenzyme q 10. A few things that we actually put into a supplement. And we reproduced the same study using this gold standard mouse model. And we looked at motor function, we looked neurological score. And then we looked at total longterm survival too. And we found that using medium chain triglycerides, which was a ketogenic fat with Arginine alpha-ketoglutarate, which is something that's in preworkout formulas. It's evasive dilator from the Argentine. Uh, we used a Gabba was in that or any view if ventilated form of gamma that crosses the blood brain barrier and um, and coenzyme q 10 in the form of identity known, which was kind of like the drug like form of it, I think it's still available.

Speaker 2:          01:05:35       You can get it online, it might be kind of a drug or Ubiquinol, which is a powerful warm. So those supplements together I think offer are neuroprotective in a way and it had a therapeutic and what I would call performance enhancing effect on this als mouse model. And those supplements had a therapeutic effect on Deanna to don't. I mean there's other things in the what's called the Deanna Protocol, uh, people interested in this can go to winning the fight foundation. Uh, it's a Tampa based als, a five zero, one c three foundation and you can sign up on the foundation and they give you the actual protocol and there's more than a thousand patients registered on this that are benefiting from the end. There's several peer reviewed studies on this. Uh, ideally we'd like to get enough funding to do a human study, but the mouse works pretty compelling and it just, it's just, it, it's an extension of work that has already been done really in further supporting a compelling support for this proof of concept for using a metabolic based approach like targeting energy metabolism, preserving mitochondrial function. So the cells work better.

Speaker 4:          01:06:42       No, when you were talking about epileptic kids and I'm supplementing their diet with ketone supplements because a lot of them have a hard time following kidogenic diet. Can you get the same benefits of a ketogenic diet by following a standard American diet and supplementing with exogenous ketones?

Speaker 2:          01:07:02       I doubt it at this time with the ones that are commercially available. But I do think that was some of the ketone esters in development right now. We've observed using a range of different animal models that, uh, the thing is that these things are not very palatable. Third, pricey to make a, but we're working with various companies and doing what's required for the FDA to be generally recognized as safe or some of these compounds. I don't think they taste bad. I've heard people complain about like think eugenics. I didn't think it was pro bono. Ingenix actually tastes pretty good. Uh, don't let it sit. If you mix it up. That's one problem with the eugenics. If you mix it up and let it sit, then it's like, tastes like battery acid for were allowed. But so I mix it up and if you just keep it with some ice cubes in it, you can probably keep it around for about a half hour. But I generally try to drink it pretty quick. But some of them, some of them are nasty. Yeah. Uh, well the ketone esters. So these are things that if I gave you right now you would gag. You would not be able to drink it.

Speaker 4:          01:08:00       Somebody sent me some. Where's that jazz? We still have that laying around here, that little thing to ketone esters and some dude sent. It was in like a sealed, a little foil seal plastic thing. I'd be curious. I know all the, all the people behind this was here somewhere. Okay. This place is a mess. What else? Um, so like if someone had a big bowl of pasta and then they took something like key genics, would that knock you back in the state of Ketosis? Yeah,

Speaker 2:          01:08:36       you could, you could eat a bowl of pasta and then consumer key gen x product and then test your test your blood ketones. I didn't. Would it look like you're on a strict ketogenic diet that's a mild, like a, what I would call a modified atkins diet were as to the ketone ester. You could eat a bowl of pasta and then take a ketone ester and it would look like you fasted for 10 days. So it puts you into starvation level ketosis. So interestingly, another application of ketones is that it lowers blood glucose and we don't know why we're studying that right now. But uh, and it may do it by your liver is like the main regulator of what your glucose is. So your liver as glycogen in it, and it's constantly being broken down and kind of spilling glucose into a. It may be affecting that process or it may be enhancing insulin sensitivity, which means you take ketones and your cells use the glucose that there becomes more readily available to the cells which greater uptake. So we're looking into precisely why when you consume exogenous Ketones, why glucose goes down, we've replicated it many times,

Speaker 4:          01:09:40       different forms of ketones. So would that be a way for a person who maybe he's just not so good at being disciplined with their diet to just throw it in there like say God, I want him to have some ice cream, but I've been really good with my diet. Fuck it. I'll just have the ice cream within. Have some key x or something like that afterwards.

Speaker 2:          01:09:56       Well, I firmly believe there's no shortcuts and I think of ketones and I try to. I think I mentioned this on Tim Ferriss too, and he put it in there that ketones are just another source of energy. So if you have, if you're eating 2000 calories of food and then taken lots of ketone supplements, you are eating a lot more than 2000 calories of food

Speaker 4:          01:10:14       [inaudible] can you tell as fat, but as far as like gaining weight, but as far as like keeping your body into a state of Ketosis, it actually does work.

Speaker 2:          01:10:21       Absolutely, and the benefits of that would be a maybe not weight loss, but by elevating your blood ketone levels, there's a lot of beneficial effects. Even from a signaling standpoint, like completely independent of metabolism. We know that it's a a, a super fuel essentially for the brain that you can. Your brain cells can generate energy from, from ketones in a more efficient manner than than glucose. That's really hard for people to believe because that's the one thing that people always would say, you need glucose to fuel your brain under certain conditions. So there are a few stipulations to that and I could get a little bit technical, but for example, I mean obviously if you have one deficiency syndrome, you know you are. You're transporting it, but they're. Your brain has a number of things that prevent it from using glucose effectively, so in many cases ketones would be the preferred source of fuel.

Speaker 2:          01:11:18       For example, there may be like with Alzheimer's disease or maybe if you even if you have a traumatic brain injury, there is an internalization of the glut three transporter so that you have cells right and glucose was trying to get in, but the glut three transporter isn't on the membrane or you can have a a dysregulation or an inhibition of [inaudible] hydrogenate complex PDH complex, and that enzyme is really the gatekeeper. It's almost like the. It's the governor. It's a throttle that lets the glucose into the cell to create the feed into what we call anaplerotic pathway is to drive the TCA cycle, the krebs cycle, and that makes reduced intermediate that drive the electron transport chain to make ATP so that it's like a gatekeeper and ketones completely bypass that process. So if you have no glove, three, if you have impaired activity of PDH complex, which a lot of people who are, you know, carbohydrate components say, well, you're inhibiting the PDH complex.

Speaker 2:          01:12:16       If you're on occasion, thank diet and I don't think there's evidence of that, but the key tones essentially bypass those steps and can restore and preserve brain energy metabolism even if those things are dysregulated or dysfunctional in a number of pathologies, you know, make them dysfunctional. Uh, and this is a general state of aging. It's thought that as we age, we have a proportional decrease in, um, in glucose energy metabolism in the brain, but that's not the case with ketones. So as we age, the data that has been collected so far shows that we have essentially the same ketone energy metabolism as from young to adults. Wow. So that's major implicated. You can graph it out and you know, we've had speakers at our conference that did that and you can see kind of like a plateauing effect and a decrease in brain energy, uh, uh, consumption from glucose. Whereas with the ketones a, it bypasses many of the rate limiting steps that are associated with impaired glucose metabolism in the brain.

Speaker 4:          01:13:17       It's almost hard to believe when you rattle off the laundry list of benefits of the Ketogenic Diet, you know, for a lot of people they're like, well, how is this? It seems crazy. It seems like it. It will. If it seems like everyone should be on it. And it seems crazy that so many benefits are attributable to this fat based fat burning diet.

Speaker 2:          01:13:37       There's a lot of bands I don't, you know, like my wife does not eat damage. It's a relatively high carbohydrate diet with people enjoy it. That's because she enjoys it and that's because her carbohydrate tolerance is really remarkably high and some people do really well on high carbs and you say until you're testing her. Uh, yeah, like, well I've tested her blood and are ketones to and she can get rapidly into a state of ketosis. I mean, we're testing some products now for ketone technologies or our company and uh, various products. And she can. It's the first time I've actually seen her ketones levels up where mine are and sustain it over a period of time. And she's like, this is awesome. This is just from taking a product a for taking himself, just the formulation of specific products, uh, and uh, so there are a lot of benefits, but it's just, I think of it as like one tool in a toolbox, you know, simple carbohydrate restriction, like it doesn't have to be acutely drank diet, but simply restricting your carbohydrates is a powerful hammer.

Speaker 2:          01:14:38       For example, for type two diabetes and a Virta health is doing more for the medical management of type two diabetes than any other entity that I know of. I mean, I think their goal is in the next decade to reverse a $100 million cases of type two diabetes. Like our government spends way more a like $200,000,000,000 of funding for managing diabetes. Uh, and you know, NASA's budget is something like a $19 billion per year or something like that. So it compare that and the, uh, you know, we know that type two diabetes, for example, which is an obesity, the major problem for type two diabetes is carbohydrate intolerance. So why would you, why would a registered dietitian administer a carbohydrate based diet to a type two diabetes person who has a problem with carbohydrate intolerance because, and that's reflected in their elevated hemoglobin h, one C or glucose levels or insulin levels.

Speaker 2:          01:15:41       Uh, so the Virta is created a platform of people who using an APP will allow you to, uh, to follow, adhere to carbohydrate restriction and acute agentic diet to essentially not just manage it but just like completely reverse it. And I would, I think the numbers are something like 89, almost 90 percent of people from the data they collected so far and publish almost 90 percent of people might be 89 or 87 percent can either completely get off insulin or like reduce it down to very low levels just simply by using a carbohydrate restricted diet. And that has, that's profound. I mean imagine the number of people that can get off medication, you know, what that can do to the healthcare system, the healthcare burden of paying all these dollars for drug management of type two diabetes, which is going up to epidemic proportions. So yeah, so, so people are out there and they have type two diabetes, just go to Virta health and you'll see an amazing array of clinicians, basic scientists and registered Dietitians that assist people for the medical management of type two diabetes.

Speaker 2:          01:16:55       It's just stunning. The list is. Oh, it was good. Like the low hanging fruit is definitely type two diabetes, so I'm glad to see the field go into that direction. But for many, many years, many decades, the only application when I got into this research, the only application with pediatric epilepsy and then two years after that it was like it works for adult epilepsy. So it's taken so much time for the science to prove kind of what we already knew. Right. That therapeutic ketosis was supplying ketones to the brain. That's an alternative form of energy and obviously that has more implications than just helping your brain for epilepsy. And there's so many other applications,

Speaker 3:          01:17:34       you know, when you're uncovering all this and when you're doing all this research and studying it and you're finding all these benefits, have you tried to figure out or contemplate like what is the cause, like why is it so beneficial for your body to live off fats versus your body to live off glucose? Is this something that we evolved to live off fats? Is this like, is it a better primary source? Is it something that our body can exist off of glucose but really were designed to live off fat. It's like, what is the cause?

Speaker 2:          01:18:05       Oh, it's multi. I mean there's many answers to that question, but I'll tell you kind of what I think that many people do really well on a carbohydrate based with no overt signs of, you know, pathology, especially really active people in that class. Like I always kind of joke, like the people that are most interested in the ketogenic diets are. Many of them are athletes that contact me. Uh, but a lot of people have health problems too. Uh, but the. But the athletes are typically not the ones who necessarily need it, but they can benefit of it. I mean, a lot of, you know, if there's football players out there and people that are predisposed to concussion or brain injury, I think it's really good to be on a key to genic diet. That's Kinda like a whole nother area we can go into

Speaker 3:          01:18:49       now for athletes when you're talking about people that like maybe they don't need it for weight loss or they don't need it for a lot of it. Is it because the massive amount of calories, the calories that they're burning and their nutritional requirements almost mitigates the negative effect of having a glucose based diet.

Speaker 2:          01:19:06       Yeah, it really does come down to calorie control. So if you have a surplus amount of calories coming in, you know, even with an athlete, you're gonna start to get some over metabolic effects and negative, you know, biomarkers kind of showing up. And if you do that chronically, it'll ultimately lead to chronic inflammation. Maybe some, you know, brain fog and other things. Uh, W, what I have observed is that, you know, I mean you're asking like a why was your question, like why aren't people not following this or what's the benefit

Speaker 3:          01:19:39       question was like because you're studying this so deeply, like have you ever contemplated like what is the root cause? Like why are we so good at burning fats? Why is it so beneficial? There's so many health benefits and it seems like there's so many negative consequences of, of having a high carbohydrate diet, especially for sedentary individual.

Speaker 2:          01:19:58       Yeah. I think you really, to put this into context, you have to think the negative effects from high carbohydrate diet are due to a calorie surplus. So I think a carbohydrate based diet could work fantastic for a lot of people who count their macros, who manage their calories, but people are horrible predictors or estimators of how many grams of carbohydrates, you know, they walked into the kitchen and grabbed some grapes, they grab a chocolate, they don't. So that's why it's really good if they want to get a handle on this to optimize or total health and performance and things to really have an app where they can calculate their macros and uneasy, you know, to do format like avatar nutrition does. Uh, so that's. So I think when you are bolusing glucose or bolusing carbohydrates, a couple meals a day, you have that scenario that I talked about.

Speaker 2:          01:20:52       You have a spike in glucose and a release of insulin and for many people, which I had was, is Postprandial dip in blood glucose where you'd go hypoglycemic after two or three hours and that would have me searching for food again. I would get irritable, I would get sleepy, my performance would drop when you go on. Didn't even have to be like a ketogenic diet. Just low carb can completely in many cases if not abolished, significantly attenuate that rise in glucose and that release and insulin. Uh, and, and you know, with a carbohydrate based Diet you can throw in more fat and fiber and buffer that too. But a purely ketogenic diet is kind of non glycaemic. Like, you don't have any rise in that. And the practical effects of that is that it tends to allow the person to control their appetite and so they're kind of controlling them and appetite suppression and just kind of.

Speaker 2:          01:21:49       And that's how it's thought that the Ketogenic Diet works too, is that you don't have these spikes in glucose and hormones and things like that that could set off a seizure, is that, uh, the leading scientists in this field a really believed that it helps put the brain into a state of homeostasis better and if there's less kind of energy spikes and less kind of noise in the system, uh, from a physiological standpoint that the brains, uh, the brain's energy system and the, the, the neuropharmacology of the brain itself, the neurotransmitters, the balance of Gaba to glutamate and Gaba and Serotonin and other things will be balanced in a way that would make seizures much less likely to occur. So, and I think that's what it does from a, from a, uh, feeding behavior from a neuroendocrine point of view, is that it helps to, when you have all these hormones and, and, uh, metabolites, you know, going all over in the blood, the ketogenic diet keeps it into a range where there's a lot less noise in the system and you can see this, uh, by a patient, a type one diabetes patient, for example, who goes from eating a high carbohydrate diet to a key to genic diet where their Dexcom continuous glucose measurement is all over the place.

Speaker 2:          01:22:59       If you look at, you know, several days of data and if they transitioned to a ketogenic diet, I mean the highest, there's way few highs and a few lows and it's within a tight range. And there they stay within the range where they're optimized, I would say. So they're in a glucose range where they're optimized and that's what happens. That's, you know, that happens obviously with a type one diabetic who's trying to chase the glucose with insulin. But for the average person, the same thing happens. And that's why a lot of people feel better, they have less cravings and there were more likely to adhere and stick to their diet and not kind of fall off the wagon and kind of overeat and you have surplus calories. So, so high carbohydrate diet is completely manageable and people who knew how to manage their calories, but that's really hard for most people will do. So I think the APP based programs that are coming out are really, really handy in there. Uh, I think there'll be kind of the wave of the future for people who want to optimize their, their body composition and their performance, and to have a kito option of that too, where you can tighten, titrate and optimize your Keto Diet. And then there was an ai system that tells you how to improve those ratios over time to hit your goals. I think that's really the future.

Speaker 3:          01:24:09       The cravings, uh, that, that's a huge factor. The not just the energy crash, but also the lack of hunger. It's a, it's really weird. Like I always felt like if you didn't eat for a few hours, you just started getting, God, I got to eat and you have this weird feeling, but that weird feeling is entirely connected to glucose when you're on a fat based fat burning diet. That the, even knowing that you're hungry is a different knowing. It's like it's in the other room. Yeah. It's not like it's like next to you sitting on your shoulder yelling in your ear. Come on man, let's eat. You know, there's a frantic feeling that a lot of people get.

Speaker 2:          01:24:48       I've seen my wife, I've seen it when she's hungry. We gotta stop. We gotta pull over when she needs ice cream. I mean it's, it's, I just, you know, give in and say, okay, we're gonna we're gonna. Pull over. Uh, and I remember feeling that way too when I would kind of go off the wagon and need a half of a box of toll house cookies. Uh, but yesterday I three packets of something called Quito cookies and uh, I put some in your, your little gift bag there. Um, yeah, and these Quito cookie. So I just, I had never eaten three packets together, so I was curious. Uh, let me, Oh, that's energy bits. So energy bits is I think a fantastic Selena. So spirit, Spirulina has an enormous amount of research behind it and uh, it's one of the products I used on the NASA neemo mission because we didn't really have access to fresh vegetables or fighter nutrients down there.

Speaker 2:          01:25:39       So snickerdoodle Huh? At the snickerdoodle bar. And then there was a chocolate chip bar and a fudge fudge chip bar where could just go to Quito, cookie.com. And so they are, that's like my Quito comfort food. So when I travel with that, I might have another box out there for you. So you have chocolate chip snicker doodle. Yeah, fledged chip. Uh, so you can eat that typically when, if I like a toll house chocolate chip cookie, I would have that crash that we were talking about and now it'd be ravenous, you know, after a. There you go. Uh, so no sugar. So it's completely like low-glycemic for me. They're like non glycaemic. Uh, so I measured my, My, uh, glucose after eating three packets of them because I went to, yeah, there was the guys behind it. So I actually just saw them at the low carb, a USA conference where a number of speakers there were on the show.

Speaker 2:          01:26:35       Gary Taubes with their robb wolf was there. I didn't get to speak to them, uh, because it was just so busy. But Quito cookie is one of those food that's evolving out of this, you know, this kind of movement. I would say that the key to genic diet diet is becoming a lifestyle. So not something that's used for pediatric epilepsy, but something like the average person can follow to just feel better. And for me, I could eat a Keto meal in the morning and I can hammer out 12 hours of work in the lab and not even get any cravings to eat at all. And that, for me, that translated into more grants, more publications, more work done in the lab. And I kind of attributed in some way that, you know, my career has gotten a really big boost because I'm more cognitively aware and resilient even during periods of sleep deprivation. I can just work longer periods and I kind of utilized Quito to my advantage in that way.

Speaker 4:          01:27:29       Fascinating. I really had no idea about exogenous ketones, improving mental function, like taking them to actually really like it would be a good idea to take them before anything taxing. I'm going to try and take a number for podcasts and taking them before comedy shows or UFC events and see if maybe my brain fires better because I mean that's just amazing.

Speaker 2:          01:27:49       Yeah. Uh, my, my wife was actually a, she spearheaded a program, uh, looking at absence seizures. So a lot of people have seizures, don't have like tonic clonic seizures, but they'll just look and stare into space and then wake up out of it with me all the seizures champion. I didn't even know he's a good man, but I feel like an illusion and you just got to try them, try them. Raj, do you have a glucose ketone measurement? I did have that, but I have a lot of calluses and I was like, I had a really stabbed the shit out of my fingers. Yeah, you do. I thought I had calluses. I got, I got pretty bad council. But um, yeah. So, uh, what was I gonna say? Oh, so anxiety other than glucose meter, the one that stabs you because it wasn't really working that well, not really.

Speaker 2:          01:28:34       I mean they go in the side of your hand. I'm like, fuck, fuck man. Yeah. So we'd go to the fingertips. I just take an actual syringe like a needle and just plug it in or I have. Yeah. So I just, I don't really feel that I've done it so many times, but uh, but yeah, taking exogenous ketones can help. We publish a paper and frontiers. It reduced anxiety behavior about 25 to 30 percent in our rats. So they would go out into what's called an elevated plus maze into the open arm where they're like on a catwalk and they could fall off or be exposed environment typically produce a fear response or they could run back into the little cave. And the Beta hydroxybutyrate salt plus the medium chain triglyceride combination, actually reduce that fear behavior. Uh, maybe it would be. I mean, I'm sure you're completely comfortable being out on front of the stage, uh, but for people that have anxiety problems, which is a big part of people who have stress, it kind of exacerbates anxiety. Uh, I mean, I felt it early on in my career. I knew that being in a state of Ketosis just makes me more mellow.

Speaker 3:          01:29:38       Well, you know, one thing that would help me with is, um, I bow hunt. Yeah. And bowhunting is behind. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          01:29:45       Really. My brother was a, he was a big bow hunter. He writes for Peterson. But when a magazine and I saw a tweet, I saw a. yeah, we had that pro force extreme, I think bose. Yeah. I grew up in a, in a boat. I grew up in a hunting family. So I quickly noticed some of the stuff out in here.

Speaker 3:          01:30:01       So, um, that's probably one of the most stressful things I do. Like people think that like doing standup, a stressful or live podcast or broadcast, those are nothing compared to bowhunting. Drawing back on a live animal and your heart starts racing, start adrenaline rush, you have target panic where you can't remember what you're doing and you go into autopilot and there's all sorts of methods to mitigate that by forcing your brain into a closed loop system instead of an open loop system, repeating mantras, going over different facets of your shot process. But maybe I'm ketones and being in an acute agentic state, especially exoticness ketones before you hunt, would mitigate some of those issues.

Speaker 2:          01:30:45       Definitely help. I mean, I think you've had them on the podcast, Wim Hoff method. I'm sure something I'm getting into a was talking with a quest ceo last night, uh, about Butenko, uh, guy in Russia designed some, some system that allows you. It's a, it's a program of breathing. I have the APP on my phone. I haven't, I haven't used it yet, but it allows you to increase your CEO to threshold. So the drive to breathe actually does not come from a lack of oxygen. It, uh, through CEO to chemo receptors on the ventral surface of your Medulla, in, in your brainstem, that senscio too, and when they sent ceo to that, that's your urge to breathe. That's your drive. And then you have a backup, a sort of like a redundant mechanism, the carotid body that the bifurcation, the common carotid artery right here will since oxygen and it's kind of like more of a fail safe that's, I studied these things, you know, for my phd and these neurons like Kelly sense how they sense things, but so you can increase your CEO to threshold over time using various breathing protocols and that can create an enormous effect on kind of reducing anxiety in these situations where a big buck comes up and you're drawing back on it, or in general, just the level oxygenation that you have.

Speaker 2:          01:32:00       So retaining some co two, if you do it through training, can actually enhance the vasodilation effect and can maybe reverse even in hyperoxygenate systems in your body. So that's the theory. And there's some, there's quite a few studies behind it. I really have to delve into the studies. But uh, the Wim Hoff method is one method. I've been fascinated with him. I really want to meet him. Actually. I love that I would go, I want to bring him to the lab and actually do some research on him. Okay. Connect your guide will be awesome. Yeah. These cookies or like a mirage, it's like you hold them, they have weight cookie. You bite into them, you'll like, this is going to be like eating a cookie and then you chewing it and it's almost like it vanishes like fairy dust in front of your eyes. But it's good though.

Speaker 2:          01:32:50       It's really good. Don't get me wrong. I'm not saying it's a mirage, like their bullshit. I'm saying like I'm there. It's a very strange texture to them. Yeah. Because obviously there's no grain it and there's something about eating and maturing them where your body goes, hey, uh, what'd you fucking lie to us? Hooky Bro. Like it tastes good, but there's something about chewing it and eating it. It's like, Eh, it vanish. It's pretty substantial to the significant amount of fat in it. Uh, so I was a little. Yeah, I was a little skeptical when they came, I was like, okay, because people send me so many products and I vet out what actually impacts, you know, my blood glucose and ketone levels and then maybe about 10 percent of the products that people send me. I really liked like the energy bits here, the spirulina tablets, I can take massive amounts and actually get a significant amount of protein and there's absolutely no glycemic effect and I'm getting huge amounts of phytonutrients in it. So I brought that on these little snack. I down like 30 at a time. So it's 33 servings a thousand tablets. Jesus. Yeah. So that would be like a month supply and you know, you can chew them, they taste kind of grassy and there's a little blip in there. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          01:34:05       Or if you don't shoot them, if you just swallow them, you don't taste them. If they don't. There's about. And that's what I did taste like. I'm almost like sesame seeds. Yeah. I like, I like it, I like it actually. Sunflower seeds don't sort of tastes like the lady Catherine. She was on a shark tank and actually they kind of slammed her because I think she evaluated the company high or they didn't like the taste. That was the main reason that, that they didn't like it, so I mean guys like you and me and most guys would be totally fine with the taste and the amount of nutrition that's in that and the density of that makes it an awesome food for things like special ops guys or even even NASA. I mean there's a lot of nutrition in that little bag right there. So stunning to me.

Speaker 2:          01:34:47       How much like mouth, pleasure factors into people's lives? Absolutely. Don't like the taste. Well, something can be fantastic for you. Like, like I expect that out of my seven year old, you know, she's like, Eh, taste gross. I don't like it. I'm like, I get it. Yeah. We'll get out of a 37 year old Jesus Christ. Ninety percent of people really eat. It's a pleasurable thing to them and they don't want to restrict that in any way, shape or form. That's crazy to me because you don't have to restrict it just for the most part taken healthy nutrients and you're like this, like, this is not bad like Jesus Christ, if this is the most suffering you get in a day, talk about first world problems, you know, these little energy bits. There weren't the best thing I've ever had. I don't know what I'm going to do now.

Speaker 2:          01:35:33       That's not bad. I mean I see it from the general consumer point of view, like I could see maybe, but once they know the science behind it, like the CEO sent me a stack of research papers and are all off of pub med and I started looking through them and then double checking on pub med and realizing there's a lot of science behind this. And actually NASA was interested in algae and making capsules because it's a super, it's super high in protein has all these phytonutrients and uh, you can grow it, you could figure out a way to grow it in space and stuff. Uh, so I think really that's a future. Like things like Quito cookie will be a gateway for people to say, okay, maybe I can go on this diet and I can have these chocolate chip cookies here too. But then eventually your palette changes over time and you don't crave those foods anymore.

Speaker 2:          01:36:19       Like it never happened to me. Now it's gotten close. But man, I smell some fresh bread or a bowl of pasta, like linguine with clams. I'm in man. But you can maybe control yourself a little bit better. Yeah, you still crave it? I don't actually crave that at all. I'm going to crave sweets and chocolate maybe. Sometimes. Not, not so much. I was a big ice cream guy though. Yeah. Oh yeah. Yeah. He was eating some on his instagram. So, uh, the institute that I'm associated with, the Institute for Human and machine cognition, Ihmc it's run by the directors. Ken Ford, he was a former director, uh, in NASA executive and NASA and they have a James Beard award winning chef that they hired into Ihmc and he has a specific, a Keto ice cream recipe which is using the mct and like a pinch of Stevia. And when you eat the ice cream, I mean, it just blows your mind that this is ice cream that you could eat every day, a big bowl and stay on a ketogenic diet.

Speaker 2:          01:37:22       So these kinds of editing, I feel innovative. You're reading? Oh yeah, yeah. It's really legit. Like my wife, my wife, she's really like the litmus test. So when I get products I give, uh, the last product I got was the Quito Brownie, so if you like Google, Quito, Brownie, it'll, it'll come up and, you know, I gave it to my wife and she was like, yeah, this is pretty good. But it had like a, a shell in it, which kind of got caught on her teeth or whatever. And she loved the taste but it was a little bit, uh, I think because she's so picky, it was like, oh, I liked it but just had a shell on it or whatever. But Quito Brownie is like another food and I see all these entrepreneurial guys kind of emerging on the scene and being very innovative in the way.

Speaker 2:          01:38:06       I mean, it takes a long time to develop and test a product that you can eat that's low carb for one thing, and then you could, allows you to adhere, to accuse yanked diet. Have you had a cave shake? You know, those are, I've heard about it. Is that company got a bunch of the fruit. Oh, maybe I can try one. Oh yeah, for sure. Okay. I'll give you one right now if you want one, but uh, we'll wait till after the show. Oh yeah, I'm forgotten those, those are giant they're made with um, a lot of good stuff in there. But I think a lot of his coconut coconut milk. Yeah. Um, this Keto ice cream company, was it called again? Yeah. Actually there's not a company that I know of yet. It's just, uh, uh, I told them they needed to create some ip around this, this formula.

Speaker 2:          01:38:48       But uh, it was uh, the, the Institute for Human and machine cognition that the chef there picked it up himself. Yeah. He has a number of recipes because, uh, the CEO there can forward. I mean, he's a huge fan of the shank diet and it's how I got hooked up with him because he realizes that it enhances his cognition and performance and has actually been a big help in moving things into government agencies and helping them acknowledge that this is a very viable, a form of a way to fuel the astronaut or fueled a special ops guy. So He's been kind of instrumental in that regard. And he is, you know, hired a, a chef that cooks ketogenic and in a, in a gourmet fashion, a James Beard award winning chef, which I didn't even know what that was until I looked it up. And I was like, well, these are very high level chefs that are specifically in his expertise, at least at the institute is to create these key to genic recipes that are like ultra gourmet and amazing to eat.

Speaker 2:          01:39:49       What about pasta? Is there like an almond flour based pasta? And not that I've, you know, I've tried a lot of things, but, uh, I would hesitate to recommend anything just because I have not been impressed enough to, uh, to really. There's some protein pasta out there that's a little bit low car, but a lot of times they kind of fill you up with a lot of soluble fiber and you just become like a gas machine, you know, it might be good for your gut microbiome in some ways, but, uh, you're feeding all the bugs in there, but, uh, for a large part like if you get, you know, every, we have a certain threshold for soluble fiber which gets broken down into butyrate and other things in the gut. Uh, and if you exceed that, you just become, you know, gas machine. And so maybe it would be good in like a small side dish. Yeah. So that's your weakness then pause. So an ice cream too or. No, I mean I can go without ice cream and sweets really don't get me that much. I mean, it's not that big of a deal. It's not something that I massively crave, but I'm a big fan of Spaghetti. Yeah, it's a problem. Yeah. You know, um, uh, I think that it's just one of those things

Speaker 4:          01:40:54       where I bet if I just stopped taking it for a long time, stop eating it for a long time, but that's been my cheap food for awhile. So if I just cut it out of my system completely for like six months or something like that, I probably,

Speaker 2:          01:41:06       you know, if you, there's a book that has ice cream, there's a recipe. Jeff Bullock has a book, it's called the art and science of low carbohydrate performance and this will appeal to your crowd because a lot of mma guys I refer to the book and they say this book was incredibly helpful to me. So the art and science of low carbohydrate performance and there's a arrest. There may be a pasta recipe in the. I know there's an ice cream recipe in there that's not unlike the recipe I was just talking about. So. But the pasta thing. Yeah. That would be. If someone can nail that down, that would be pretty good. At logical achievement, it would be filled with some weird stuff that it. You were just in Italy. I saw some pictures where whereabouts and did you have pasta and pizza when you went off? Like a rocket way off. And I do that when I was in Naples, I and I got to have pizza. That was quite awhile ago. But you know, it's moderation too. Well they also have different flower and I talked to. They do, that's right.

Speaker 4:          01:42:05       Maynard maynard Keenan from the band tool also has a, an Osteria, a restaurant and a um, a vineyard that he runs in Arizona. He's a weird guy, but uh, he explained on the podcast, on the podcast rather than I did with him recently. The difference between the Pasta that we have today in the bread we have today and original heirloom wheat which is less, it's lower yield per acre and it has a less complex gluten's in it. And he's like, that is what, when people are talking about like the difference between how your body tolerates like certain gluten, whether it's gluten sensitivity or not. He's like just, it's just a different feel. And I really noticed that when I was in Italy when I would eat their pasta. I mean, it just, it tastes different, it feels different when it's going down. And I actually ordered a bunch of it from, from Italy, and I even cooked it at home and I noticed it

Speaker 2:          01:43:00       Lawrence. And she. Did you get any, you don't have any gi? So if I go, which I don't, if I go to the movies, sometimes I'll get popcorn and I'm completely okay. Like eating popcorn and then, you know, a day or two later and back into ketosis really fast without even exoticness ketones. But if I do eat pizza or pasta, which I did in the beginning when I would have like these cheat meals occasionally, uh, I would have some major gi issues because your body is, you know, digestion, assimilation, transport of these things. You're typically eating on a day to day and then you go without eating them and it's like your body doesn't know what to do with it. But when I did go to Italy and we travel around all over the place, my wife, you know, loves to travel, uh, and we were in Naples and I ate maybe two or three pieces of pizza. I had absolutely no problems whereas that in the US that would have bothered me and maybe it was just a, it may have been the flower on a guarantee.

Speaker 4:          01:43:55       The flower, it's a, it's just a different kind of flour, I think what they call it, it's called double o flour. See if you can find that jamie flower that they use and they'll specify for imported wheat flour from Italy that it's a special type of flower and that flower is essentially heirloom flour. So the difference between like when you buy a tomato from the grocery store and it's Pale and bulletproof and you can throw it down a flight of stairs and it doesn't even get bruised versus heirloom tomatoes, which are almost like a fruit, I mean really is essentially a fruit and they're juicy and very delicate and very, very fragile as well. There it is. Is double o flour worth the price? Well, pull it up. One that had the right. Got It. Um, uh, yeah. I don't know man. I mean that's my, that's my big problem. But if I, if someone does do that, if they save, they follow a key to genic diet and they eat a bowl of pasta, I can't help it. And then they take exogenous ketones and it knocks them back into ketosis. Is that, will it stay that way even though they bought the body to digest that pasta and they'll be in ketosis again tomorrow?

Speaker 2:          01:45:06       Good question. It won't. It'll stay that way based upon the Pharmaco kinetic properties of the supplement you're consuming. So a ketone salt product, you know the ones that are on the market. If it's mixed with a fat, like medium chain triglyceride, a the Quito oms system and the eugenic system, our BHB and MCD, you'll be sustained for longer. But if you do choose to try to get the benefits of ketones and you're on a carbohydrate based diet, you have to consume obviously more exotic ones. Ketones to get the benefits of ketones. And you could do that though, so someone could theoretically do that

Speaker 4:          01:45:42       and just take exogenous ketones and maintain pretty much the

Speaker 2:          01:45:46       exact benefits. And Yeah, you can do that. And a lot of people are kind of confused, or like, well, what's the body going to do with the glucose? Or what's the same thing? You could say the same thing if you eat fat, you know, what's the body going to do with the glucose? Well, uh, well interestingly, glucose goes down and we don't actually know why we think the liver kind of sends out less and these products are not really like a huge amount of ketones, right? It's just enough to get you maybe into the one millimolar range and we know that's enough to give your brain like a boost and give. It's one millimolar of ketones in your blood. Actually, record represents a pretty significant source of energy that your brain can use and that your heart can use. We know the heart runs more efficiently off ketones.

Speaker 2:          01:46:27       Uh, and probably more importantly is that the key tones function as signaling molecules that inhibit anti inflammatory processes. Uh, so deep dixit at Yale University did a study actually with one of the captains. What's his name? His name is Deep Dixit Jesus Christ. I never thought about it. Yeah. Now he's got a scientist at a comedian right there. I'm like, wait, hold up. I always look at his Indian name, but he always tells me to call him d, But a deep Dick's, Dick's, it, sorry. He, he's a really good scientists and the leader in, uh, in studying the effects of calorie restriction and a and ketones, and he observed that ketones elevating ketones has a signaling effect, completely independent of the metabolic effect, which everybody thinks of ketones are a source of energy, but they are also like a hormone. They're like a drug. So they hit specific pathways.

Speaker 2:          01:47:24       The pathway that he found a at the study at Yale was the NLRP three inflammasome. You don't have to know that, but uh, when that Amazon is activated, it releases a lot of inflammatory cytokines in the body which are in that inflamma. Zoom is linked to a lot of age related chronic diseases too. So as we age, we have more systemic chronic inflammation. So I always say the people that have that can benefit most from the ketogenic diet. You tend to be get more insulin resistant and more trunk obesity as we age, so they are people that will be a more receptive to the benefits of the Ketogenic Diet as we age, we become more carbohydrate intolerant as we age, but anyway, it's the Beta hydroxy butyrate is functioning as an anti inflammatory, like independent of the energy pathways. So he established that and uh, it was actually a diet that I helped him formulate with exogenous ketones.

Speaker 2:          01:48:20       And after that got published a, I got a number of emails from pharmaceutical companies because they wanted to sort of reverse engineer something that had the same effect as a key tone, but to put it into a drug. And that was a, there, there is a pretty intense, you know, interest in the signaling properties of ketones and pharmaceutical companies, especially histone deacetylase inhibitors. So Beta hydroxybutyrate ketone, you measure it from your blood functions to as what we call this h Jak inhibitor, which affects the genes. So you're actually turning on genes that are neuro, neuro, protective, that are cellular protective, that are linked to longevity pathways. So think about the rewards of developing a drug that did the same thing, but the financial reward, you can't patent Beta hydroxybutyrate and well in different forms maybe shows you whenever something's good, someone comes along and tries to fuck with us.

Speaker 2:          01:49:14       Yeah, I mean, I, you know, you could say it's, you know, probably for the most part driven by greed, but there is a legitimate, uh, impact on human health and longevity. Wouldn't that just be better suited for the Diet? Absolutely. I think it's awesome that our body makes this natural metabolite. So the ketone salt products you buy on the market are, the ketones are derived from natural sources. So you are giving, you know, uh, uh, you are elevating a bio identical form of a ketone that your body a, there's a little bit of the debate because there is a d form of Beta hydroxy butyrate in the l form. So we call that receive mic if they're together, they're receive make. And The d form is kind of what your body makes, but it can also convert it to the l in certain tissues and it can get really complicated.

Speaker 2:          01:50:04       The important thing is that the salts that you consume that are commercially available, the d form is more likely to be broken down and utilized as a source of energy, whereas the l form probably sticks around more within the cell and we know the l form actually also functions in these signaling roles. So the l form has antiinflammatory effects, the l form, you know, hit these signaling pathways. So the received make mixtures that are in the salts may have extra benefits over just a pure deform because the l form can kind of hang around and stimulate all these pathways we know are beneficial before it's get broken down into fuel. So there might be some sort of a benefit for people even honest strict ketogenic diet taking exogenous ketones. Yes, absolutely. And I think, you know, we work really closely with uh, the Charlie Foundation and I think the kidogenic diet should never be replaced with exogenous ketones at this point because the science, the research is not there yet to validate it, but we want to go in that direction because there's some kids who really like their fat intolerant.

Speaker 2:          01:51:07       They throw up when they like the ketogenic diet because it's too high in fat and a proportion of the kids are like that. Most kids can follow it. But, uh, but even for like childhood cancers and stuff, we, uh, I, I met with the, the, uh, the Max love project. Uh, he was on Jimmy Kimmel Max. He was a brain tumor, a child with a brain tumor that is, his family is treating them with a ketogenic diet and they helped many families around the area and they have a foundation, just Google Max love project and uh, and his family is helping a Max adhere to and stick to a key to genic diet as an adjutant to his standard of care. So not a replacement. The huge drank diet does work remarkably well for some people as maybe a standalone therapy for cancer and have the anticancer effects, but as an adjunct to the standard of care, it's remarkably effective.

Speaker 2:          01:51:59       And they're working with, um, I think with Orange County yet. So they have a lifestyle medicine program at Children's hospital in Orange County where they're helping a wide variety of families who have kids with cancer, uh, stick to and adhere to a key to genic diet as part of a wellness program after they went through their cancer treatment. Because if you're a child and you get the standard chemotherapy, you are kind of left in a situation where you're far more likely to have a lot of different health, a negative health consequences after that because the chemotherapy wipes out your immune system and can create, you know, additional mutation. So there's kind of like a fallout from the, from the standard of care and being on a ketogenic diet can be cellular protected, can help you in a neoadjuvant and, and after, you know, before standard of care and even after Sandra care help you recover and get your body back into like a detoxified state if you want to use that term.

Speaker 2:          01:53:01       That's amazing. Now how many cancer research places are adopting this? I mean, it seems like a, that would be gigantic and this is a big shift over to standard care of just a few few years ago. Right? Yeah. So the idea is, and we wrote a grant with the Moffitt Cancer Institute, which is a tea, like a tier one cancer research center. I mean, they essentially reached out to us and say there's, there's significant interest in this from the National Cancer Institute, National, uh, Nih, national institutes of health to use the ketogenic diet as an adjective in at this point instead of replacing standard of care, which, uh, only in situations where the standard of care is not effective should that be the case, but as an event to further enhance the efficacy of the standard care. So the cues drank diet, we know limits glucose, a beat availability to the tumor which requires a glucose for growth and proliferation.

Speaker 2:          01:53:59       It decreases insulin, adoptable bell and insulin signaling drives cancer growth. And it also elevates ketones. And ketones may have an anticancer effect. And for the most part, especially in very aggressive tumors that have dysregulated Mitochondria, they can't use the ketones for fuel a nearly as well as they do like fuels like a glucose and maybe even glutamine amino acid. So it enhances the standard of care and helps them, uh, actually protects them from the healthy cells, from the radiation damage, from the standard, it sensitizes the tumor to radiation and kills off more tumor. And it protects your healthy cells. So when my colleague Adrian check at the Barrow Neurological Institute has done some remarkable work in animal models showing this and that has translated into a human study and actually garnered more interest in this area to use the ketogenic diet as an edge event. I think in some cases where the standard of care has failed for Glioblastoma or advanced metastatic cancer.

Speaker 2:          01:55:00       I think the key to genic diet can kind of be a base therapy for a more comprehensive metabolic based program. And we wrote an article called the press pulse where the key to genic diet and maybe something like metformin and other drugs can, can be used to weaken in the cancer. And unlimited fuel source and then you can connect, come in with more maybe more aggressive ways like hyperbaric oxygen therapy, which can reverse tumor hypoxia or various a low dose chemo regimens so you will weaken the cancer, you know, you put your body into a state of Ketosis and then you come in and pulse at predetermined time points maybe every three weeks of therapy in a much lower dosing regimen to gradually knocked down and reduce the tumor volume over time and you do it in a more gradual way instead of going in there, you know, with surgery, radiation and Chemo, which is kind of like slash and burn and it leaves the patient.

Speaker 2:          01:55:58       The patient coming out of that therapy is much, much weaker than when they came in. So at therapy can be developed that when the patient comes in and they come out the other side, they're actually in more robust health. We know that they can, you know, we could do that doesn't grow. That's possible from a theoretical standpoint, you know, with various research being done in animal models and what we know about nutrition and physiology that can be done. It's just going to take some time to do it. It's just so interesting when you talk about the shift of information. I mean when you were in college,

Speaker 3:          01:56:27       being fat phobic, you know, to now being like one of the premier guys that's out here preaching the benefits of the key to genic die and then seeing this, I mean, up until really recently, cancer research always dependent upon these, you know, chemotherapy and radiation and all these different standards that everyone's been having success with, but the idea that you could actually make a person healthier through the Ketogenic Diet and hyperbaric chambers and things along those lines. That's a, it's amazing.

Speaker 2:          01:56:58       Yeah. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy actually is FDA approved for things like radiation necrosis. Like when you have radiation, you know, on a tumor, you have a lot of necrotic tissue and patients would undergo hyperbaric oxygen for radiation necrosis. And, you know, I would, I would go to these, uh, various conferences over the years and talked to these physicians and these patients would make remarkable recoveries, you know, even after they have therapy. And it seemed like something else was going kind of going on here. And, uh, and if I go back early in my work, I mentioned that we develop these technologies through our work with the department of the fence and when the officer where we, we build a hyperbaric chamber and then we buy an off the shelf microscope and install it inside the chamber. And then we close it up and then we pressurize it to simulate, you know, what a dive would be while we're looking at the Mitochondria and, and even the cells.

Speaker 2:          01:57:51       And I did that with like Kelsey's stem cells and neurons. And we did it with a Glioblastoma cell line and we noticed that the cells were exploding with high levels of oxygen. I didn't know what I was seeing at the time, but I looked into it more and started contacting some of the leaders in the field. And, uh, and they reported a. One of them was Thomas Seyfried at Boston college and he was a, a neuro genetics professor at Yale University and then had moved to Boston to expand it, a ketogenic diet program for cancer. And he told me, you know, what you're observing is damaged mitochondria from cancer cells which have damaged Mitochondria and if you give them more oxygen, it will produce proportionately more reactive oxygen species and that oxidative stress would essentially trigger a necrosis and a pop ptosis in the cell so they would be able cell death at a level of oxygen that was relatively nontoxic to the healthy cells.

Speaker 2:          01:58:46       So, and then we did some work with ketones and saw that ketones were stopping the growth of cancer too. So we had this idea of using, you know, nutritional ketosis plus hyperbaric oxygen and studying that in a mouse model of cancer. And, uh, and we've got some remarkable results that we published and this is, uh, you know, patients are doing this kind of a in an off label way. They're doing the Diet. But now we have, if we go to clinical trials dot Gov and you just look up ketogenic diet, you see more than a dozen studies, you know. So when I got into this, there was no studies, so now there's been an interest and even maybe people like jumping on the bandwagon of, you know, if they have a particular drug, will accuse drank diet, enhance it, or let's see if it enhance it, the standard of care or let's see, we're standard of care failed.

Speaker 2:          01:59:34       If we can get these patients on this metabolic therapy and see if we can help them with quality of life. It's so exciting. I mean it's just really amazing, exciting stuff. It's so, so interesting seeing something like this emerge. It'll relatively late in terms of like medicine and science. I mean 2017. We're talking about something that's diet. Yep. So just if you google like kidogenic diet and a Google search around 2012, it's down here and something happened around 2013 or 14 or just skyrocketed it was that. Do you know? I have no idea. I mean, I was on Tim Ferriss and other things, but a lot of my colleagues, so, uh, probably dating back to 2014, 20, that could be, but it's really my colleagues. I mean there's so many humble, so, well, you know, I'm sure your colleagues have a lot to do with it, but as far as the impact of the impact cast, the impact that a podcast has in terms of the amount of people that are going to google something, it's probably, yeah, many, many magnitudes greater than anything that anybody is doing, you know, from professor or, you know, some.

Speaker 2:          02:00:41       I realize that now. So, and I, I thank you for letting me have this platform. But, uh, I, I almost feel like there's guys like the guy that got me into this was Dr Jiang row and he was at Barrow Neurological Institute. He mentored my colleague Adrian check into looking at ketones for Glioblastoma. He's runs the pediatric center in Calgary Right now. Uh, but Dr Eric Kossoff from Johns Hopkins was a big, big help to me. A number of people. I feel like they should have this platform, but you know, they're, they're so busy they don't do podcasts, but I realized fairly early on it was really important to get the message out because it does no good if you're not hitting a big target. And what I focused on was not just one application, but I mean we do everything from wound healing to these genetic diseases to cancer, to various seizure disorders.

Speaker 2:          02:01:31       So I realized this was a lot bigger than just pediatric epilepsy and uh, and it's the only way you should eat it is. I mean, I don't know, tell everybody they should eat ketogenic, but I definitely feel that they should at least go into ketosis a couple times a year if not for just longevity effects for anti inflammatory effects when, um, when things pop up and we're under stress, like a, had an email yesterday, a person had severe shingles or severe, like a outbreaks of a, even the, like a fever blisters or something like that, or cold sores. And if they just fast and do the ketogenic diet, it suppresses that. Or when they had. Since they've been on the Ketogenic Diet, they had profound suppression of some viral disorders that when the virus, when there's viral shedding and there's, you know, you're affected by the virus, it causes profound, uh, in inflammation and neuroinflammation, so it kind of starts with a headache and then it will kind of lead to the itchiness or whatever associated with shingles, but they described it very elegant, you know, elegantly in an email and it was very clear, you know, before and after, since they've been doing the ketogenic diet had a profound effect even more so than the drugs, anti viral drugs that they're taking.

Speaker 2:          02:02:49       So even something like HIV, which contributes to neuroinflammation and even different types of cancers, like a Kaposi Sarcoma, I think, uh, being being in a state of nutritional ketosis could probably offer a lot of benefits to HIV patients that really struggle, you know, with some symptoms that are associated with inflammation and other things associated. So this is another path we're going into it. So some of those researchers has reached out to us and say, hey, the NIH has a proposal for this. Let's write a grant together. So I'm in the like, it's been, it's crazy because I only have such so much of a bandwidth, but people from Ivy League institutions are reaching out to me and saying, Hey, can you help us formulate a ketogenic diet or can we use your ketone supplement to do a study on things I never thought, you know, a nutritional ketosis would be applied to.

Speaker 2:          02:03:44       Now what about wound healing? You brought up wound healing. Yeah, that's the big one. Uh, one of my students, uh, Dr Shannon Kessel, she actually works for the epigenics foundation now helping the dogs at the Quito pet sanctuary. She did her phd on the effects of ketones on a wound healing model. And the model that we use was, uh, essentially, you know, the back of a rat. Hopefully there's, you know, animal protection people. But, but in describing what we do, we basically have a wound that's a pretty, pretty nasty wound on the back of a rat where one side is a schemic, it lacks significant blood flow and the other side is non ischemic. And then which has normal blood flow and there's like a chunk of tissue kind of taken out and then we look to see how fast that wound closes up right over time and we do it in young animals and we do in aged animals and we take animals and then we feed them a standard road in Chow, which is high carbohydrate Roden Chow, and then we have a number of different groups where we give them various types of ketone supplements.

Speaker 2:          02:04:48       And we found that, uh, admitted that the ketone supplements enhance the wound healing not only in the aged, which was pretty remarkable and ischemic, but also in the young had event. So it was like for the young healthy guy that has a cut or a wound on the battlefield or something like that, it can help that wound heal up faster. And it's doing it through a variety of mechanisms. Probably a, the wound itself is often the, the wound tissue is deficient in ATP. The energy source because the blood can't get to it. Right? So the ketones can restore like 90 percent of it has 90 percent less atp in some cases we have ischemic wounds. The ketones have the ability to like we think, thin out the blood and be able to get to that wound tissue that's lacking oxygen and blood flow and not only does it restore the energy to the wound healing which can allow cells to replicate and heal up the wound faster, but I talked about the anti inflammatory effects.

Speaker 2:          02:05:48       So persistent chronic inflammation can prevent the wound from healing up and by suppressing some of the inflammatory pathways that can kind of open the gate on the activity of Eris growth factors and healing processes that can heal the wound up and it seems to be pretty profound in the age, but also happens in the young. Now this is just taking exotic Pr Jones and not even entered Chow from rodents, standard child. So we didn't want to kind of messy up the the data in any way. We actually should've done a well if we had the funding, we could have done a key to genic diet plus keynote and supplementation. And you think that would be been better? Yeah, I definitely think it would because the ketogenic diet alone suppresses some of these inflammatory components that, that is associated with impaired wound healing, especially impaired wound healing in like a diabetic model.

Speaker 2:          02:06:39       So I talked about hyperbaric oxygen therapy, the main applications that is for diabetic wounds that don't heal up because the oxygen and glucose doesn't get to it. Uh, so in the diabetic wound, the problem is that, uh, it's really a blood flow problem and we did to answer that question that determine if it was blood flow. We did a doppler blood flow analysis of the blood flow into wound and showed that it was something like a 25 or 30 percent increase in blood flow to the wound when we induced acute ketosis. So we'd given jd incredible, we stimulate, you know, ketosis that would mimic Qj diet or fasting. And then we do a doppler blood flow analysis and we show a pretty remarkable increase in. That's a huge increase. Yeah. That's being. That seems like that would be the move for someone who's recovering from some sort of research or something, a hyperbaric chamber combined with Ketosis mutagenic and for the Va.

Speaker 2:          02:07:37       My collaborator on this project, dr lisa gold at one time, she was the, she was the president of the wound healing society. And even she was like, this is really reMarkable. I mean, to have someone of her stature, she's an md phd, a really comment that this is profound, you know, effect on wound healing really motivated us to follow up on this. but, uh, we have not gotten funding after that, so we really need to keep working because we need to follow up on this study, uh, and get this as a legitimate wound to a lot of people are trying to enhance the wound healing process by putting things on the wound, you know, but we're wound healing is enhanced if you alter and optimize your metabolic physiology that promotes, you know, substrate and oxygenation to the wound, you know, and that's what ketones do.

Speaker 2:          02:08:25       I mean, you have a vasodilation effect. There is a big increase in a denison. Denison is a pretty profound vasodilator dilator, so you have a vasodilation that's improving blood flow to the area where there's not only glucose in there, but there's ketones and ketones help restore the energy in that wound that is sufficiently depressed from lack of blood flow and it's promoting or reducing a lot of the inflammatory things that are preventing it from healing in the first place. So, uh, yeah, I mean this was really like it was presented at the wound healing society and they were, a lot of people were floored by it. So it's. Shannon has a, my student has went and moved on and doing postdoctoral work at another place, but I really need to follow up on that. We have a lot of projects, you know, we're trying to process in parallel right now, but yeah, I neeD another student to, to, because that may have been, you know, that.

Speaker 2:          02:09:16       And you know, some of the motor function, gLucose lowering and antianxiety effects are all thinGs that kinda jumped out of the data from us that I like never would have expected, you know, is I came in this to look at seizures now. What was the hard data in terms of like what is the percentage of increase in healing across the board with the, with the routes. So if we look at time time for that wound to close and heal up, it's about 20, 20 to 25 percent. That's significant mirrors. The amount of blood flow that you were talking about, the increase in blood flow big about 20 percent does. I don't know if you could draw a direct correlation to that, but obviously if you have improved blood flow that's getting nutrition to the wound, uh, and we know that that blood has ketones in it which have anti inflammatory effects and things like, you know, it stimulates a, the h deck, each tech one and two, which stimulates superoxide dismutase, another antioxidant enzymes which are often dysregulated, you know, at the wound site.

Speaker 2:          02:10:15       So it's doing a lot of, not only just restoring oxygenation and blood flow, but it's having like a drug like effects these metabolites are really like signaling and it makes sense like, you know, if we're in a state of starvation, ketosis, the ketones would have, you know, be telling the brain to do certain things and different neuro pharmacological pathways that it should be altering our behavior in ways you don't want to. The person that is deprived of food and becomes tired from hypoglycemia and qa is the person that's going to die. So the people that survived in the absence of food availability were the ones that became more lucid and clear and we were able to go and forage or hunt down the animal and kill it and eat it. So we Are hardwired. I mean, to answer your question, I think a while back you asked, you know, why, why do we have ketones?

Speaker 2:          02:11:03       Why? I think it's an evolutionarily hardwired system that, uh, is just built into our dna. And, uh, you know, with the advent of carbohydrates and frequent feedings and you know, a deli on every corner here, we've largely silenced that genetic program that becomes activated upon food deprivation that can stimulate a host of beneficial things from extension of longevity to autophagy. And no, rhonda, patrick, you know, and I'm a big fan of her, she's talked about this a quite a lot and she's awesome. And uh, yeah, she's super awesome. She actually visited the lab and we did a podcast with her at our lab. Yeah. Yeah. She's just scares the shit out of me. Every time I talked to her I'm like, basically a monkey knows the same languages. Her, she's like an encyclopedia of information. Uh, and she always come prepared. So I came prepared.

Speaker 2:          02:11:54       I was like, yeah, I should do it. Rhonda does. So I wrote down some notes here. I probably, there's probably things I'll forget, but um, but yeah, so yeah, it's, it's a system that typically was activated in the normal person, you know, uh, during periods of millennia ago. Yeah. And actually enhanced your concentratIon. Absolutely. That's one of the things, to go back to the hunting thing, my friend remy warren, who's a pretty famous, a hunter and one of them, one of the things that he says, and he's always said this, that he likes to hunt hungry and one of the things he does, he does these back pump back country hunting trips solo and he purposely brings to little food. Yeah. On one of the things that he's found over his many years is that when he is actually hungry is more tuned in and he does a better job of understanding what's going on.

Speaker 2:          02:12:48       Yeah. It's amazing. Like the first time I actually started experimenting with fasting or even a calorie restricted diet. I took a walk around my neighborhood at the time and it's like my whole nostrils opened up. I could smell things. I could hear things. I was more lucid in ways I had not been before, uh, even fasted for seven days and was able to give a lecture and train in the gym and lift weights that were not hardly much lower than what I typically do. So I probably couldn't. Do you know, it was just at seven day per point after no calories. I was starting to freeze at all, no galleries after seven days, just water, water and some, uh, like a bullying cube, so some electrolytes like sodium potassium and lots of water and I allow myself a, about a third of the coffee that I would typically drink.

Speaker 2:          02:13:37       So I'd have a small cup of coffee in the morning and I got a ton of stuff done during that week. Like I had, you know, because I didn't have to, to make my food, I didn't have to clean up my food, I didn't have time eating the food. So I saved a lot of time. Uh, I think I lost eight to nine pounds and then within a week or two it, it all came back again. You know, a lot of it's new, you're holding glycogen and, and you lose like a. But uh, in regards to, you know, at the time I'm like, my deadlift strength was maybe eight reps for eight or 10 reps with like five 65. and I was able to do 10 easy reps with five plates on each side, which is about 500. Uh, and you know, typically going into this, I was parenthood when I was, you know, I followed, I listened to [inaudible] podcast and I was a huge follower during aids in 1994.

Speaker 2:          02:14:29       And I was eating. So I was eating four to six meals a day with shakes in between. And I remember even having like nightmares, I would wake up in the middle nightmare. Like the nightmare would be. I didn't have like food on me after two hours. Like I would have to eat like every two. I was so obsessed with getting bigger and stronger. And so for me to fast seven days and to be out of my comfort zone, that was like a big step for me. So I kinda just did it to mentally liberate myself from chronic overfeeding and things. And because I was, I had just read and studied george cahill and the harvard medical school study where they fasted for 40 days and I'm looking at, you know, all the parameters on that. And I was like, it's not going to kill me, it's probably going to do me well.

Speaker 2:          02:15:12       And uh, the more I did it, the second and third day we're, we're kinda hard for me. But after like the fifth day it became, it was bizarre. It became like really easy and I was just kind of like floating around like, like my body had no inflammation. Uh, I wasn't buzzing with energy, but I was very lucid and I didn't feel like I need it to be buzzed. Like I realized I'm so much, but a lot of times I feel like I need to drink coffee to amp up to be my best. But I was my best when my brain was really calm and I was able to put thoughts together. And I wrote a whole lot of research proposals which later became funded, you know, and I got probably of the proposals I really worked on. It probably got over a million dollars of funding during that time.

Speaker 2:          02:15:55       I really intensely worked on, on various proposals because I just transitioned into like a tenure track position. So it allowed me to work on manuscripts and proposals and just put thoughts together that maybe I otherwise either wouldn't have the time to or the mental kind of resources to get into that counter intuitive that you have more resources with less calories. It does. I mean, you know, I was burning my body fat for fuel primarily. Probably lost a little bit of muscle, but that fuel, that fat was becoming ketones and that my brain had switched over. I was doing low carB but not really full full quito at the time. But it really, it's like quieted my brain in a way that I was able to really. Maybe I have like mild adhd because I like to do so many different things. But it quieted my mind and I was able to wake up like every morning I was waking up a lot earlier than normal, like 4:35 and I typically sleep till like seven.

Speaker 2:          02:16:50       But I was able to like wake up and just focus and get a ton of work done the first three or four hours. and then then I would go into work actually. And just, you know, meet with my students or teach or do whatever I had to do, but I just remember getting a ton of work done during that period. I've never reproduced it. I never went back and, but I did a whole bunch of blood work on me to give, you know, a little bit of insight as to what's going on during, uh, during the fasting stage and everything was really positive. You know, there was a big, uh, my insulin was really low at the time. My glucose was really low. I got down to like 25 at one point because I, I've experimented with a couple of different things and my ketones were really high.

Speaker 2:          02:17:30       My ketones were like double what my glucose was at a couple time points during that. So it's an edge. I would, I would encourage people, especially maybe people that are prone to cancer or people who have had cancer in the past and maybe had treated and are kind of in a state of remission. Uh, if you go, if you get your body into that, what we call the metabolic zone, where the level of ketones are higher than the level of glucose, that puts tremendous metabolic stress on cancer cells or precancerous cells that have a huge appetite for glucose, so, and that contribute can, can initiate autophagy. So even people who do not have cancer, but perhaps you want to just make sure they're holding off of it as a preventative maintenance. Yup. And I think it can stimulate almost purge your body of cancer cells that are weakened by in this fasted state and also precancerous cells that may be in the transition of trends, you know, d differentiating into this.

Speaker 2:          02:18:28       No cancer like cells. These cells are very energy demanding, especially if they're replicating. And if you deprive them of energy, the quote unquote energy crisis signal that these cells receive can, can initiate a program, cell death we call apoptosis and autophagy. And that's the benefit of this. It's almost like housekeeping. So think about it, you know, you accumulate a lot of dead cells that are kind of sluggish or mitochondria kind of sluggish. And then you fast for a week and it's like reboot. It's like a setting. It's like a reset button. So did you, um, I, I had, I did a podcast with robb wolf or he was talking about this morning, god who went for a whole year without eating. Did you, if you pay attention to that? Not, not only did I pay attention to it, I've presented that at a number of different meetings and people, people say bullshit.

Speaker 2:          02:19:19       But this is actually a, it's in a. oh man. I think I, I may have had it. I was going to actually show it at this, uh, at this meeting. But I think I took the slide out. I had it in his back. people with this guy did 382 days. Not only did he lose a tremendous amount of weight, he went from being morbidly obese to being like a normal sized person. But here's the big one. The skin shrink. Yeah. That's normally one of the most part. Yeah, for the most part. I mean significantly. We're, most people have to. When you're that big and you shrink down to a normal sized person, they have to cut your skin or you just walk around like a flying squirrel and when you have like this crazy extra skin, right? Yeah. Well this guy, somehow or another through this 380 plus days of fasting, his body shrank accordingly.

Speaker 2:          02:20:11       Yeah. Yeah, that's right. So he was about 500 pounds, actually, travis christofferson and I wrote a blog article and it was part one, two and three, the history of the key to genic diet, part one, two and three. And it's on rob wolf website. So if you just googled the history of the ketogenic diet and land on rob's website, you'll have, I think we talk about the story in there. Uh, it's a remarkable story. Yeah. The guy was like 500 pounds and he fasted for like 381 days or 82 days and he went down to 190 pounds. And the remarkable thing is that he sustained that over. I mean, he maybe went back, went back up like five or six pounds, but largely sustain that weight loss, that's the quarter time. So he was running completely all fat, the fat that he had stored up and uh, and he was studied pretty intensely and the thing that came out of the data was a, it was a pretty significant drop in magnesium.

Speaker 2:          02:21:08       So that actually convinced me. Yeah, I definitely should probably maybe supplement magnesium was fasting anything, any vitamins or they did give him an electrolyte. So it's in the medical records and I dug into this as much as we could. Uh, his glucose levels got down to like 20 or 25 a couple times and maintained it was given potassium tablets to keep his heart healthy and multivitamins every day. Yep. I'm just rough. You have done is it robs? Yeah. Yeah. I think I've seen this, but yeah, fast at 300, 82 days. A incredible last 275 point five pounds now. Who was calling bullshit on this? Well, I did present it to a, like a mainstream, you know, clinicians even just coughing. Well, it's actually really fun, like the first it might've been the american epilepsy society where they kind of marginalized the ketogenic diet or it may have been another, it might've been neurology and epilepsy society at the time.

Speaker 2:          02:22:08       They're warming up to it just because the data, they can't, they can't turn their back on the data because data is data. So there's a massive amount of data emerging that this should, uh, this is grossly underutilized and should be really the standard of care. Even the frontline therapy, like we all kind of realized, but neurologists would have to have a sidekick registered dietician or whatever. But, but so during the time one of my first presentations was to a medical doctors, you know, that we're in it for cme credits and things like that. Like just standard conventional. And I talked about, you know, towards the end I was like, well, I followed the ketogenic diet myself and they're like, they're like gas or like, oh, what's wrong with you? It's like when I explained to them that I was normal in the question answering after were like, well why do you do it?

Speaker 2:          02:22:53       And was like, are you okay? This is going back like 2009 or 10 years ago. It was really bizarre to them that someone would actually fall the ketogenic diet. And I was doing like the classical, I was trying to do like the, you know, the, the, the hopkins protocol or was using eric kossoff spoke on the, on the op 98 and two. Uh, I was, I was about 80, I was a three to one, so it was like 85 to 88 percent fat and I was sticking to it. And uh, yeah, so people really just think it's a really bizarre, if you don't have a severe neurological problem to be at the time and now that's just evidence of how mainstream because you, you know, you see it in mass media, you know, athletes going on quote unquote the ketogenic diet. I'd question whether they're actually ketogenic.

Speaker 2:          02:23:42       Uh, they need another measure of their ketones to really. So the ketogenic diet, you're in ketosis by virtue, by the definition that your blood ketones are elevated above zero point five millimolar. And typically most people, that's pretty hard to achieve. If you're up to one millimolar, which is mild ketosis, you take a hundred people out of the population, they eat the standard american diet, maybe one, maybe two people will achieve that if they like go all day without eating or something like it really takes a while to achieve. So you have to be doing something pretty radical to achieve that blood measurement of a state of ketosis and not seeing that in pro athletes. So I know there's a few fighters we should take before she retired. She went ketogenic, uh, her boyfriend, brian caraway. I know he was key to genic for awhile. That's just my experience with athletes, but I know that there was a lot of people that are looking at it.

Speaker 2:          02:24:33       Yeah, I would, you know, kind of questioned whether they were like kidogenic. I'm sure they did low carb, but if you eat too much protein that converts to glucose, it can kick you out. But, but then again, I mean I, some, some athletes that contact me, their output is really high so they're actually giving like five or six hours of output a day and they're eating like two or three chocolate bars and they're getting like 250 grams of carbs a day, some of them. And there's maintaining a mild state of ketosis, especially post exercise ketosis. Even with drinking suddenly something like that, you can start like a slow burning like a soup, like a slow carb, like a tim ferris advocates, uh, and they stay in ketosis and if they back off more, if they back their carbohydrates down to like 50 grams a day, they start to lose performance on that.

Speaker 2:          02:25:19       I mean these are people with very high output though. Ridiculous. Yeah. We talked about five hours of exercise a day plus, and they went from a thousand grams of carbs a day to 250 and better. Fifty grams of carbs for the standard average person. This is not applicable for an mma fighter is two and three days. Uh, I think, I think you could, especially the older guys like older guys, I think you could readily adapt them. Like I said though, I think that adaptation should probably occur during training in the off season and give themselves a buffer zone of three months and actually work with a coach or work with an app, uh, like avatar nutrition or something where they calculate the macros and they actually know they're hitting the macros. And the body is amazing. If you actually hit the macros that are calculated, your body will go into ketosis.

Speaker 2:          02:26:10       I've never seen. There's very few people that you can't get into quito, especially if you use things like mct and really adjust the macros. And you could also do key to key to genic intermittent fasting where you kind of don't eat throughout the day but then eat through a window or time restricted eating as a rhonda. patrick calls it where you basically just eat within, you know, a, a six hour window. And I like to do that. I'll eat from 5:00 PM to 11:00 PM and just kind of eat a big meal and just kind of graze a little bit throughout and then I get, you know, a pretty good chunk of the time fasting. And then after I'm done with work, you know, I'm not frantically running around trying to get stuff done so I can relax with my wife and just kind of kicked back and eat and just, you know.

Speaker 2:          02:26:54       And that's kinda what I wanna eat anyway. So you feel like there's more of a I'm doing a 14 hour thing you think is even more benefit doing an 18? I do. I think, you know, I don't, uh, I do uh, for, for me I definitely think I do a because there's something about like a couple hours extra where like if I fast for 14 hours but then go like my ketones really start to go up from 14 to 18 hours and then. And then I could actually stay in ketosis if I eat key to genic during that six hours of eating. If I kind of pay attention to, you know, eating really low carb like I can eat and before I go to bed I test my ketones and bam, I'm hitting like two point two or something, so I continued to get the benefits of having ketones, but when it comes to like things like rhonda talks about like autology, I think you can even get more benefits with an 18 hour fast and you do that and you'll have to do it every day.

Speaker 2:          02:27:53       I think you could just do it. Like you could actually do it just once, maybe twice a week and get a lot of benefits from that. Like if you do that over the course of a year and that's not hard to do, right? If you could just convince people, hey, take the breads and pastas out and just put in more vegetables and just do intermittent fasting. You know, every, every tuesday and thursday. And if they do blood work after like three months, they're going to see a profound effect. Probably not even changing the diet. They're going to see. A profound effect now is someone told me that there is an effective way to measure ketones through breathing. There's some sort of a breath monitor. Is that, is that real or? Yeah, there's a couple of, uh, some of them were being showcased at the conference. I was at the low carb usa.

Speaker 2:          02:28:36       I'm the one that I have the most experience with is a product called ketone x and uh, and now they have a bluetooth device out where you can blow into it and it reports to your phone and it shows you, shows you the parts per million of acetone in there and acetone. So you make beta hydroxybutyrate nsc to acetate as the two primary ketone bodies that are used for fuel. And also they have signaling properties and acetoacetate can break down a spontaneously decarboxylates to something called acetone, which you knows, nail polish remover. Right? So a acetone actually has some really interesting a brain effects that calms the brain down a sub narcotic levels of acetone, a open potassium channels that when potassium channels are opened that hyperpolarizes the membrane potential for neurons and makes them kind of more like charged batteries and it also kinda calms your, your brain down.

Speaker 2:          02:29:33       So iT's not firing action potentials as much and that's a good thing. So instead of all this kind of fluttering of activity, it helps to kind of synchronize your brain in a way by elevating. And this goes back to homeostasis, right? So that acetone has, can correlate with seizure control. So parents who have kids who do not like to get their fingers pricked, have used the breath. Acetone, you blow into it, you get a pretty color, you know the kids like it and everything. It is kinD of hard to like set it up, you've got to calibrate it. And so it's a little bit clunky to work with but it does pretty good indicator if you're registering like orange or red on that, you are definitely in a state of ketosis. So. But I call it only semi quantitative, so they need to work out some of the bugs and if you just look up breath acetone meters, there's probably about five on the market now.

Speaker 2:          02:30:26       And the one that I have experienced with is called a key tonics. And if you're acetone is high and you're not taking ketone supplements, you are burnt. You are cranking your fat metabolism, you are really, you know, mobilizing fat and burning fat for energy. So it's a pretty valid indicator for burning fat for energy. Blood is the best. Bloods of gold standard probably will always be. there's technologies emerging out now at least you know, small companies that are a essentially a, you put a like a bandaid like thing on your skin and it's measuring glucose. It's measuring a, you know, potentially beta hydroxybutyrate acetoacetate and things like lactate. And then it'll go to your smartphone. So you can look at your smartphone and see your glucose levels, your, your ketones, your lactate, and maybe some potentially other things you could adjust your diet or drink a supplement to optimize you into a, you know, maximizes your strength, maximize your performance, or maximizes your brain protection in extreme environment like high pressure oxygen or a navy seal or something like that. That technology is in development now and will probably surface sometime in the next year or two. And I think it will be pretty cool. So think of a dexcon, but instead of just glucose, it'll give you like a metabolomic profile of your blood. And then there'll be, you know, you can augment it in with your diet or with various supplements.

Speaker 3:          02:31:51       Now I've got two other important questions. One physical performance. Um, have there been studies on reaction time on all sorts of different variables that I think, I mean if you're looking at all of this, increase in blood flow, decrease in inflammation, all those things are what you would want out of a body that you want to perform better. It seems like things would fire better as it will, for lack of a better word, what have there been studies on putting athletes through variety, stress tests, reaction times, things along those lines, those

Speaker 2:          02:32:25       studies need to be done. And I think at some of the marketers out there that are promoting ketone supplements are based on some animal data and I think they're extrapolating some of the effects. Will ketones offer a metabolic advantage? You know, they can, you can generate more atp. You can, it gives your brain resilience under inflammation or hyperglycemia. uh, but the, the bottom line is that these studies need to be done and they need to be funded. Some of them are going on right now and some of them are. I'm kind of involved in a. And probably most important is, you know, what are they actually studying? Like what, what key to genic diet are they actually studying? Like what are the macronutrient ratios, not only the ratios, but what types of fats are they using, you know, what type, what's their protein source, you know?

Speaker 2:          02:33:14       Uh, and that's really important. And when it comes to ketone supplements, like that's a whole nother box of worms are, I mean, are they using, you know, just pure sodium, beta hydroxy butyrate, are they using like sodium potassium, magnesium combination which would offer more benefits? Uh, are they really using [inaudible] for if the dna or are they using a ketone ester? So there's like lots of these, uh, considerations. There's lots of nuances, you know, in the way these things are formulated in the way they're dosed and in what type of application, whether it's a pure strength application or what I call strength performance, like pushups and chin ups and things like that, like a or endurance or ultra endurance or things like that. So do a lot of research needs to be done. So I didn't really give you an answer, but I think the guy who's done the most research on this clearly, at least with the ketogenic diet, is Jeff Bullock from Ohio state university.

Speaker 2:          02:34:09       His faster study clearly showed that athletes in a state of nutritional ketosis burn like, you know, almost twice the amount of fat, you know, and they maintain that, which is remarkable. I mean, does some elegant studies to show fat oxford vaccination rates are like double of what we even thought were achievable when guys follow a well formulated ketogenic diet and he recently did a study, a using a ketone salt product showing that there was an enhancement of eight percent performance in workout. Put a with a cyclist. So big number. April is pretty big for cyclists. Yeah, it might've been time to exhaustion. He just presented it here. I didn't even know he had the data actually, but I mean jeff volek is the leading researcher on and he wrote the book the art and science of low carbohydrate performance, which a lot of mma guys have benefited from because they emailed me.

Speaker 2:          02:35:03       Uh, but these, these are studies that I'm really interested. I mean we've done a lot of work in animal models and now we're transitioning to a human studies. We have a study at duke university, so I mentioned a oxygen toxicity to study this, you know, in humans in these big environmental chambers at duke. And then we do some stuff with nasa and the nasa neemo mission. I was on a, but we're really interested in moving a lot of these animal studies, which we've done. Now we're ready to move into humans, but we still don't know what the optimal supplement is and that's why a ketone technologies, a company we developed this really focused on identifying not the supplement that gives us the best margins for sales, but the supplement that's super optimized for particular applications. Now another question I wanted to ask you was about migraines.

Speaker 2:          02:35:55       Now I would assume that people with headaches, headaches, you take nonsteroidal anti inflammatories. Someone with migraines mean it would, it would seem to me that that would be something that might be able to help mitigate. Yeah. Yeah. Um, there's a student, I'm on her dissertation committee, uh, elena gross and she was a student, uh, graduated from oxford university and is now doing a clinical trial on a ketone salts for migraine. So what motivated her to even pursue this as a phd project is that she had crippling cluster migraine headaches and she reached out to me and, uh, she actually presented at our metabolic therapeutics conference and that's her area of expertise. Like when it's happening to you personally, it motivates you in a way that you just immerse yourself in the research and you become like a leading expert and I think at the, at the very young age that elena is, and she's got a great background of education behind her.

Speaker 2:          02:36:53       She's kind of the leading authority on nutritional ketosis for, for migraines, which is a growing field because a lot of people who had migraines that have contacted me and tried either of the ketogenic diet or ketone supplementation have benefited from it when nothing else worked for them. It doesn't work for everybody, but in some people that have these crippling headaches, it better than anything that they've tried so far. Um, and migraines, uh, some of the data coming out, there's two sets of data that I've seen showing that migraines are linked to neuroinflammation. Uh, for example, if it's caused by a viral etiology, there's kind of swelling of the brain that leads to this kind of low systemic neuroinflammation. and maybe the ketones are working through an anti a and anti inflammatory effects. Uh, sometimes like I said before, people get shingles or like a cold list or they'll get like a headache throughout the day and that's probably neuroinflammation and then there's other data to show that these migraines actually may be like a mini seizure, like your brain is actually having a mini seizure that's not manifesting as a grand mal or tonic clonic seizure or even an absence seizure, but it's, but it's presenting as a migraine and it's seizure.

Speaker 2:          02:38:12       Like I would say some of the data is indicating that and ketones seem to be a viable strategy for, uh, you know, for migraines from what I've seen. and that's why it's being studied right now. The other question is, what about someone who's on a vegan diet? Yeah, I get to a lot. I have a really close friend. Uh, she's vegetarian. I'm dr don carnegie as a ihmc. We've talked about this a lot for a vegetarian, it's relatively easy, right? Because you had a dairy and you have eggs and eggs are a huge staple. I buy the happy eggs, which actually tastes a lot better. They're like the free range egg a, but a vegan diet is a little more challenging. The charlie foundations, a dietitian beth zoo pack, Kenya is her name. Uh, if you go to the charlie foundation website, I think you may be able to find some information or a pamphlet that describes how to put together a vegan, a kidogenic diet.

Speaker 2:          02:39:08       So there's no way that you can hit the macronutrient ratios, have a key to genic diet that's vegan unless it's in a shake form. So in this case, you know, formulating a product that's more of an illiquid form that you can drink is probably the way to go. If you do do a vegan ketogenic diet, whole food, the best that you could do Is really about maybe 60 percent fat, maybe 70 percent fat, and if you formulate the diet with coconut oil and mct, that'll get your ketones up. And then if you consume, you know, one of these, uh, various products on the market that are essentially medical foods or drinks that you can drink, you know, you can stay in nutritional ketosis. So it's a, it's a struggle. It's, it's possible, but it's way much, much harder. People do do it though, then they follow a vegan for ethical reasons or for a cultural reasons and they've been able to do it.

Speaker 2:          02:40:03       But vegetarian is doable of vegetarian is very doable with eggs. If you can use eggs and dairy. I tend to minimize dairy in my diet but yeah, so eggs are huge. So you minimize dairy because of the effect it has on you or like a lot of dairy protein like way it kinda started with whey protein and I drank it for years and maybe I just built up an allergy to it. But if I were to drink like a full shake of whey protein right now it would make it wouldn't agree with nigga. Uh, although I can, I can eat butter and sour cream a fine, no problem. And a lot of dairy proteins, especially casing if I eat a sour cream or cottage cheese. Cottage cheese. Yeah. So something about that can start to irritate my gut a little bit. So I generally just minimize it.

Speaker 2:          02:40:51       I do like cheese is kind of a weakness for me. So I might get a little bit of cheese here and there, like almost every day even when I'm home, but uh, but I know dairy really was the cornerstone of the cute agentic diet with the original ketogenic diet with the, like what johns hopkins was formulating because it's been so easy and it tastes good, right? Uh, but I do find that when people are following the qj diet for weight loss and they kind of pulled out the dairy, their fat loss increases. So I've observed that kind of anecdotally, I'm not sure if people have studied it, but if they just, for example, pull out the heavy cream and put in a concentrated coconut milk, which I use for my heavy cream, which almost has a same cream, like consistency and they take out the butter, maybe use more coconut oil and just kind of switch out dairy for other things, their fat loss and something about dairy in some people.

Speaker 2:          02:41:46       Not everybody, uh, maybe caused them to retain water. Might be like a mild allergan. So for me, I'm okay with it as long as I kind of minimize it, but I've just heard so many stories. One, uh, there was a case report, now have a mother who had an autistic child and put them on a ketogenic diet and did remarkably well and then made it dairy free and it was really the dairy that was contributing to some of the symptoms. So I think, and this went, this is in the medical literature, it's like on pub med, she use a dairy free ketogenic diet and had quote unquote remission in an autistic child. I firSt saw it, presented an abstract at a meeting and I was like, wow. It was really blown away. And then about a year later it came out and it was in a pretty good, uh, pretty good journal as a peer reviewed publication and pretty well documented case report of putting an autistic child into remission with acute junk dot.

Speaker 2:          02:42:40       so we talk about emerging applications. I know my colleagues, uh, dr jiang roe and dr susan massino are studying, and I mentioned this because they get so many emails about it. The ketogenetic diet for autism, so I think many things are. Could be the next frontier formation. Yeah, yeah, yeah. It could be lending if diet, you know, reduces inflammation and if diet without dairy reduces inflammation further that I know a lot of people are having some great effects with cbd oils, which again, reduce inflammation. Something I'm very interested in. Yeah. I've talked to a nation. It's just such a giant factor in, in negative health consequences. Ketogenic diet plus a cbd, a plus hyperbaric oxygen therapy plus ketones supplementation is something that I wanted to study in a brain tumor model. A, I've just gotten too many emails from parents that have kids with epilepsy and also people who have cancer who use cbd oil and they felt it was remarkably effective for them.

Speaker 2:          02:43:40       So, uh, I've talked with the ceo of charlotte's web and other cbd right here. Yo, I've never actually tried. Is that the charlotte? Their brand. So is this a standardize for a certain level of thc? It's below a certain level. Is each batch and standardized. It doesn't get you high. That's what you mean? Yeah. Okay. So that was sort of the problem I tried to do is work with our university and then I need a dea number and it was like all the students had to have a d and it became so much red tape, but I'm going to revisit this project and I'm sure you reconnect with them, try to connect you if you like, because they're actually a sponsor of the podcast real and yeah, they sent me a bunch of it and I tried it out for awhile before I took them on as a sponsor.

Speaker 2:          02:44:27       I'm like, this stuff's legit. yeah. Read up about it. You know, they, they use the whole plant as well. So it has all the canals, the other cannabinoids. Yeah. Which I think is important. Uh, you know, there's companies that have patented the specific can have a dial on there and that's kind of, I was going to use that and there's a lot of, you know, da regulation even on that I think. But yeah, I will. I'm going to revisit that project because I really think, uh, some of the things that we do with the diet and supplementation will synergize, uh, either be additive or synergistic with cbd and I mean, I love this idea of developing very powerful therapies that make the patient come out more healthy or does not cripple their immune system or their general health when they come out the other side, especially with cancer.

Speaker 2:          02:45:14       It's just absolutely incredible that you could have a more robust person. Yes. Therapy. Absolutely. I think it's possible. Yeah. So With cancer it is tricky, like every person is different, but if you get a robust like healthy person to begin with and you can develop a therapy that manages their tumor. Uh, and I've seen very healthy per people come out severely crippled after rounds of chemo. I've seen people killed with chemo. I mean, I know quite a few people actually, sadly, that have been killed literally by the standard of care. And this, uh, you should really have my colleague on here. He's a very dynamic speaker, a little bit controversial in some ways, but dr. Professor thomas seyfried from boston college, he wrote the book cancer as a metabolic disease and uh, it's a fantastic book that, you know, elegantly documents the theory of cancer as a metabolic disease, uh, with a lot of hard data.

Speaker 2:          02:46:14       And travis christofferson, I wrote a book called tripping over the truth and I wrote the foreword to the book which discusses a why we view cancer as a genetic disease and kind of lays out the data and um, you know, all the evidence to support cancer as a metabolic disease and what we should most importantly like what we can do about that in regards and that has major implications for not only how we treat cancer, but how we prevent cancer. so I talked about, you know, fasting to purge your body, have precancerous cells so it would fall in line with that. But there's really good hard data behind, you know, this idea that cancer is not, maybe not necessarily all cancers are, you know, metabolic and origin, but a large majority of them appear to be. And uh, and I think the national cancer institute and other organizations are aware of this.

Speaker 2:          02:47:05       And now they're funding more grants that actually target cancer metabolism and even developing metabolic therapy clinics for, you know, targeting tumor metabolism. So this, this was never, this never happened, you know, a seven, eight years ago when I got into this, it was kind of unheard of, but there's a lot of interest now in pharmaceutical companies developing these target molecules that inhibit specific glycolytic sugar consuming pathways. So as evidence. So the [inaudible] diet is great, right? because it hits many pathways and synergy, like one of my slides, you know, that I have and my conversation or a in the presentations that I do is clearly shows like it could see all the boxes there. So this is the key to drink diet and these are all the different signaling pathways that is working through. And I would say pharmaceutical companies may put billions of dollars just into one of those little boxes.

Speaker 2:          02:48:03       You know, the key to genIc diet works. It's so powerful because it's many different, as many different, uh, signaling is many different pathways. Kind of working in synergy for a common output in this particular slide was the neuro pharmacological effect that it has on suppressing seizures. the anticonvulsant effect. Wow. So, and each one of these is validated with a number of peer reviewed publications that you can bring up on pub med. So it's not like something some guy put together, I mean it's published and it's like you go to pub med o hdac activity. Okay. But you knew it was like a half dozen publications to support each one of these. So that's what's really exciting to me because there's just so much to be kind of discovered and so many different applications and like I said, it feeds back to nutrition, which was like one of the main things that motivated me, you know, early on in college.

Speaker 2:          02:48:53       So I can do, you know, go back to something I'm really passionate about, but it's all fascinating, man across the board. Uh, and thank you for sharing this man. Thank you. Thanks for giving me the platform. Thanks for going on the tim ferriss show. And without that I would've probably been her for that. Yeah. Thanks. Thanks tim, and if somebody wanted to get started with this, what's the best resource, like what do you think would be the best way to do it? And I got a few, so I would say just go to our website. I have a website, quito, nutrition, all one word.org. And on that website I have a list of resources from ebooks to. I mean there's ketogenic pizza, there's a link. Make cute agentic pizza. What's a. yeah, I mean the almond flour, the crust is essentially like a, like chicken and parmesan cheese pounded into like a cross where they put, you know the, the cheese and the sauce on a low carb sauce on top of that.

Speaker 2:          02:49:50       Yeah, I love this stuff. It's real foods. A company is. I think someone told me that they're in ralph's here, so I guess they're really doing. They're doing really well, but I'll have like one or two of those for breakfast in the morning, especially if I'm kind of on the go. They taste, they're legit, they're really, really good. Like, I vetted out a lot of things and just kind of very particular towards things that I really like and actually tested. So this is something that I've kind of tested with blood work. Uh, so kiddo nutrition.org at a link there. If you click on that link, it's, you get a discount on, uh, on the, on the, uh, product. Uh, max love project is really, I mean, if there's families out there, parents out there that have kids that have cancer, please contact the max love project and they are helping so many families through innovative application of the key to genic diet for childhood cancers.

Speaker 2:          02:50:39       Uh, virta health. So type two diabetes is like the elephant in the room is a massive project. Virta health is basically tackling this project, uh, by curing literally quote unquote reversing type two diabetes, uh, in up to 100 million people in the next decade. I think that's really. And I talked about people who are just embarking on diet alone or the ketogenic diet avatar. Nutrition is a way that allows people to not only calculate their macros because people are horrible. Calculating what they eat, but it has an algorithm in it that if you put in body composition changes on a weekly basis, it will tell you, you know, it will guide you step by step to your ultimate goal. And as far as I know, there's another system like that. I mean, it's like think of weightwatchers, but like a version like five point. Oh, in weightwatchers that actually works with you.

Speaker 2:          02:51:34       Uh, so I think I'm going to have all these resources on kido nutrition.org, but if you google any of those terms, a kito pet sanctuary for people who have dogs that have epilepsy or dogs that have cancer, look up quito, pet sanctuary.com. There's an ebook on there. It's completely free. You can download it and get the recipe on how to put your dog food together, uh, that can not only prevent or help treat cancer or seizures, but also just get your dog as healthy as possible. And you know, uh, the charlie foundation, I really have to give. I acknowledged the charlie foundation in my tedx talk and they were probably one of the leading foundations that really convinced me and talking with hollywood producer, jim abrams and, uh, really convinced me that the diet was legitimate, uh, outside of the peer reviewed papers that I was reading and, uh, and there's a movie by meryl streep actually called first do no harm.

Speaker 2:          02:52:32       So meryl streep did a movie on the ketogenic diet that most people look it up. It's called a first do no harm. So meryl streep start in a ketogenetic diet movie. That's incredible. And, uh, and it was, that movie really floored me because I had no idea that she did it actually. But, uh, it's that movie and meeting jim, meeting jim abrams and what the charlie foundation is doing through a global education is really inspired me to pursue this path, all the people that they're helping. So it was so cool that I could, I feel really blessed to be able to get into a field of research that is in line with what was funded to do, which was enhance safety performance and resilience in the warfighter. But apply it to so many other things and uh, and also apply it to myself, which is, has been kind of a journey in and of itself that I've really enjoyed.
