Speaker 1:          00:01          Hello Freak bitches. Why do these patterns repeat themselves? What is it about human beings? Well, we like things simple. We like things simple. So C and then you often like a simple explanation is a good explanation unless it's too simple. But distinguishing between simple and too simple is no easy matter. We like, we like to know who's our friend and who's our enemy and we like the feeling of under and moral superiority and then learned morals, which had, especially when there is no such thing as earning anyways. So, and then, I mean there's deeper and darker things that are underneath that. It's like the human proclivity to pull down those who have more than you. It's like these kids on the campuses who are claiming identity with the oppressed, you know, somewhere like Yale. It's like how in the world you can speak of oppression if you happened to be at Yale is beyond me.

Speaker 1:          00:57          I mean, first of all, your North American, which puts you in the top 1% and then of North Americans, you're in the top 1% two in the top 1% of 1% but yet you, you want that, you want to have all the power that goes along with that and you want to have the moral superiority that comes from being a, uh, representative of the oppressed. So that's exactly what you want. You want all the power and you want all the victimization at the same time. Well, years. Yale is a great example because Yale was one of the, what happened with the Halloween costume debacle had gail was one of the first videos that was released that made people horrified where they couldn't believe how students were communicating with professors. Yeah. Well do a student who, who screamed up a storm about, about that. Uh, the male professor who was the husband of the woman who wrote the Pro Halloween costume letter, it turned out she was on the bloody hiring committee that hired him.

Speaker 1:          01:53          One of the things she screamed was, who hired you? It was like, well, it turned out it was you because you were on the committee just a few years before. I know. And they took it like, yeah, that was absolutely in the people. Well that don't know what the hell we're talking about. Well explained this debacle because it really was about questionable Halloween costumes. Well, it was about questioning Halloween costumes. Halloween costumes are part of the whole point of Halloween is to have questionable costumes, right? You play with death for example, in decay and and horror and, and it's, it's a time when the norms with regards to the expression of things that are outside of our normal behavior are suspended so that everybody can can have a little celebration. As it turns out. Well, you know, campuses have got all upset about things like cultural appropriation at Queen's University in Canada just the other week they were going after students who were dressing up as Viet Cong for example, or Mexicans.

Speaker 1:          02:51          It's like, I just don't see what the hell's racist about dressing up like a Mexican. Mexicans have a traditional traditional clothing. What? There's nothing wrong with Mexicans. So why is it wrong to dress up like them? And if you want to be Puncho via for Halloween, what's wrong with that? A wall will get what you can. You can regard that as an Omar's just as much as a denigration. It's like why is that such a problem? Right. But anyways, it doesn't matter because nothing's too trivial to be a problem to a social justice warrior. And because they don't like to deal with real problems. And Yale went after Halloween costs. So this woman wrote a letter saying, maybe we should just relax about this stuff. And you know, not don't put restrictions on what people wear for Halloween, but let people decide what is and isn't offensive.

Speaker 1:          03:37          Yes. And well, in many Halloween costumes are offensive. That's the point. But her letter was in really reasons. It was perfectly reasonable. It was like an, it was like an adult wrote it. Yes. Yeah. And, and you know, all hell broke loose, all hell. And she ended up, she ended up quitting. And I think he did it. No, I don't think, I don't think he left. I don't think he left, but she did. Seeing him bow down to this woman's screaming at him, swearing in his face was so disturbing. It was so humiliating. I felt so humiliated for him cause she was screaming, this is our home. What the fuck are you doing? You're not making a safe home. The university's not a home. It's not a safe space. It's not a secure space. None of that. And, and if, if it that when they get a university isn't a home, that's not what it is.

Speaker 1:          04:29          It's a place to be confronted by, I would say often horrible ideas. You want to learn about history, you think that's going to be safe. Do you know what human history is like? It's an endless blood bath with, you know, with, with a certain amount of a hopeful progress underlying it. It's, it's a, it's a, it's a horror show and great literature is like that. And, and, and biology is terrifying and physics is terrifying and you want to be safe. It's stay home. Stay home with your mom, stay home with your dad. Don't come to university if you want to be safe, because anything you do outside, no one of the, if you, if you're going, if the university is going to make you safe than it ceased to be a university. So one of the things I tried to do in my class, I have this class called maps of meaning, which concentrates on atrocity basically on Soviet atrocity and, and Nazi atrocity mostly.

Speaker 1:          05:19          And what I tried to do in the class is to teach my students that had they been in Nazi Germany in the 1930s, they would've been Nazis and had they been offered the opportunity to be in Auschwitz, Auschwitz, camp guard, then maybe they would have leapt at it and maybe they would have been in the sadistic, uh, in the more sadistic proportion of the Auschwitz camp guard population. You think that makes you feel safe. It doesn't make you feel safe to know that Nazis were humans and you happen to be one of them. And so I think that educators that tell students that they're offering them a safe space are doing them a profound disservice. And you don't, I'm a clinical psychologist. Here's one of the things you do to make people less afraid. You don't make the world safer. What you do is you people tell you what they're afraid of and then you break it into little bits so that they can go confront them.

Speaker 1:          06:11          You know? So maybe they were afraid of going to a party and you break that down and you say, well, do you know how to introduce yourself? And he said, well, I don't, I don't really even know how to shake someone's hand. And so then you practice having them shake their hand and introduce themselves because maybe they weren't taught by that by their halfway did parents when they were, when they were young, because they were ignored. And so then you say, well, maybe you can go to a party for half an hour and all you have to do is introduce yourself to two people and then we'll call that success. And you build up their competence and their confidence one step at a time. And what happens to the clinical literature indicates quite clearly is you don't make people less anxious. By doing that. You make them braver.

Speaker 1:          06:48          It's not the same thing. You don't make the world and its horrors smaller. You make the person and their their their capacity to deal with horror larger. You encourage them, you strengthen them. That's what you do at a university. You arm people with arguments, you, you hone their intellect, you, you help them learn to write so they can marshal their arguments. You, you'll help them learn how to engage in intellectual combat because that's better than engaging in real combat. And you make them, you make them hard and strong. You don't mollycoddle them and make them safe unless you're their enemy, unless you're trying to devour their spirit. And that's what we have in the universities. We have, we have the reign of the depaul mother who's, who's answered everything is all just come a little closer deer and all protect you from the world. It's just like Hansel and Gretel, the, you know, the, the, the which in the Hansel and Gretel story. Well my house is made of gingerbread. Just come in here and everything will be fine while she feeds you candy to fatten you up so she can eat you. That's the archetype of a modern university.
