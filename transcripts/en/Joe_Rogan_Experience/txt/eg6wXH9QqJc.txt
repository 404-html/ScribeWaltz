Speaker 1:          00:00:02       Shazamm pitches. Yes. We're back four days a row this week. That's how crazy. That's a crazy, we live in out here on the west coast. Holla. Let me see. I just made it an east coast west coast thing. The Joe Rogan experience podcast is brought to you by the fleshlight. There's no different way to do this. I've done it every possible way. Um, I'm just gonna say it. Uh, what is the flashlight Joe? No, I have not. I actually reused it. Yesterday I was watching my girlfriend on camera was another girl and I used my flashlight. Wow, buddy. He had a little personal what the whole rest of the world right there. There's a lot of people that they're not comfortable with someone that they think is their friend, like little Brian red band, telling them about fucking and watching things. Have you ever done when there's that moral degenerate, like you bad for society, have you ever seen one of those webcams house?

Speaker 1:          00:00:47       Yes, I have. It's pretty cool. When he sent me to a link the other day that was a he, he goes, what the fuck? The mother load. And, uh, I go to the link and it's this some crazy cam site where it's all girls that are topless. They like playing with themselves and it's all free. Yeah, it's weird. It's like, like you can, there's the one I used as stream mate and you can go to and just have a conversation for the girl while she's like sitting there topless. And then she's like, you want to go in a private room for $10 and then you do whatever you want to in the private room. And, but this was all virtual. Yeah. Like this is like webcams and stuff. And so, but there were so many old ladies and fetishes that that was just creepy to look at.

Speaker 1:          00:01:21       Like at an old lady. Like there was like an old lady. I was like maybe 75 years old. Let's get through these commercials so we could talk about this flashlight. I want to hear about this, I want to hear about this, but let's get through these stupid commercials cause that sounds too good to just be delegate adult. The adult industry has always been pioneers of new technology. Whether it was like home, video, you know, and then like on the Internet, I mean, they've always been the first. And when we have virtual reality, I bet virtual sex will be pioneering. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. All right, let's go. We're gonna get to that. We're going to get to that, but let's get this out of the way. Flashlights sponsored Joe rogan.net entering code name. Rogan get 15% off. It's a, it's a solid product. The best fake vagina out there really is way better than mass period.

Speaker 1:          00:02:00       There were also brought to you by [inaudible] Dot Com oh andN I t makers of Alpha brain, the cognitive enhancing supplement that I use. I didn't take one this morning, so let's see if I stumble, if I stumbled over my words today. I don't have any more. You took all my dude, I gave you something. Did I give you some of the new stuff? No, no. I got some new stuff for you. Need to get on it. Oh, and what is this shit? What is it? What are you talking about? We're talking about nootropics and when nootropics are there, vitamins that are designed to enhance the function of your mind, the way you're thinking works, and they work, they work if they're only going to get better. Yeah. Do you try stuff? What do you do? I have not, but I'm a, you know, David Pearce who wrote the hedonistic imperative talks about, you know, how nano technology eventually it's going to be used to like design vaster and more broader versions of human intelligence. And I'm sort of all about tinkering with ourselves in order to sort of improve ourselves. We're the ultimate art project is us, right? So it's kind of like, yeah, why not? I got to get you some of this just to see if you like it. Um, I have some people have gotten it, are completely

Speaker 2:          00:03:00       addicted to it. It's, it's fascinating stuff. I like it. Some people, they're the most, the most important thing about this product I should say, is that we have for the first order, for your first 30 pills, there's a money back guarantee. 100% you don't have to send the product back. All you have to do. Say, you know what, the stuff didn't work for me and you get 100% of the money back. We are way more concerned with having people feel like they're not ripped off. Then with making money, so a check out the stuff. It's all on a.com. We have a sports related supplements, immunity related supplements. We have a new mood, which is a five HTP supplement, which boosts your Serotonin, actually makes you feel happier. It's great stuff. It's all healthy for you. It's all, it's all explained online is a frequently asked questions. You can go into it in depth and and Google nootropics and try out all the different stuff that's out there and just check it out. But go to [inaudible] dot com if you're interested and uh, under Alpha brain entering the code name, Rogan, and you get 10% off, not just the first order, but every order. All right pitches

Speaker 1:          00:03:53       Jason Silvas back. He's slinging experience. Try by day Joe Rogan podcast all day. Jason Silva come back to sling more cosmic Dick. You said we are cosmic revolutionaries. I say, you're a cosmic Dickson. I love that.

Speaker 3:          00:04:14       Wow. Well, thank you for having me back, dude. Last time. It was so fun. Thanks man. So funny, a great time. I just a shout out to all these amazingly engaged listeners and followers, dude, that the response was so positive and so yeah, we have a really light, totally positive

Speaker 1:          00:04:31       propositive group of people that follow the show and it sounds ridiculous. Um, how do you do that? I mean, how does that ever happen? I don't know. But if your authenticity, man, well, if I'm, I'm honored. If that's what it is, what it, whatever it is. I'm honored. Comes across, man. When we go to clubs, that's the thing that the waitresses are always saying that our crowds are so nice and that they tip really well and it just makes you feel so good. It's like the most, the biggest feeling of accomplishment that I've ever had is someone who listened to the show once and said, your show makes me want to try to be a better way.

Speaker 3:          00:05:01       This is the kind of feedback that we've been getting about our MindMeld. Dude. It's been insane. Like some people have created these remix videos where they've taken highlights and sound samples from all we've talked about to imagery and set them to music. And that's kind of like what the creativity and the whole remix culture is all about. It's not about where you take things from, it's where you take them to see that. It's just like, oh my God,

Speaker 1:          00:05:22       there's a bunch of those out there now. There's so many guys that are really good at that too. There's so much creativity and most of them have like regular jobs. They're just like regular dudes. So they're doing it out of pure passion. Yeah. Like says there's a kid, he calls himself the paradigm shift on Youtube and I met him and you know, he's a man, he's just really fucking talented. 90 he made this thing for me, the American war machine. And uh, I mean it's like, it's, it's humbling. It's humbling because you, you, you hear the words that you say and they, the kind of the words seemed just kind of obvious things that you've thought of and set up a hundred times. Right. But then when you, this kid puts it to images or video and music

Speaker 3:          00:05:58       and you see the power of an idea of the power of an idea to live on beyond its inception, beyond the moment that it came out of your mouth. There was this guy, the thinking primate is the youtube name and bay. They did a remix of us and I thought it was glorious. Honestly. I thought it was glorious. Yeah, there's a lot of those guys out there and yeah, we're, we're super honored that they do that. It's a, one of the coolest things of all time. It's so weird. It's a weird thing going on right now, man. I think the Internet is kind of ushered in a whole new culture. I really do believe that. It's, uh, it's, well, you can't get by on bullshit anymore. It seems like a culture of massive collaboration and cooperation. And even that recent example of that, a viral video that they made about Joseph Kony in Africa and it reached 100 million views in a week, you know, and like, and I think that just what it shows between that and also the Anti Sopa movement online.

Speaker 3:          00:06:45       I think that what it's really demonstrating, it's just the ability to create viral swells that have massive impact without having used like mainstream media for example, let's just make a video, put it on Youtube for free and have a voice in the national conversation. Like everybody can do that. And the price points keep going down and down and down exponentially. And it's, there's no reason not to think like, God, what comes next? Well, yeah, well this guy, I don't know the whole store and the guy who orchestrated the whole Kony campaign, and I've seen some criticisms about him, but it did, didn't really make much sense to me. I mean, it seems like this guy really is a war criminal and what this guy's doing by exposing that. And it was like, yeah, we're exposing a really, a guy has tons, some terrible, horrible things.

Speaker 3:          00:07:27       Oh, no, absolutely. I just think the success of the campaign, it's amazing. Game Changing, game changing, viral success, uh, also is going to invite a scrutiny that comes with that. But whatever the controversy is, that's a whole separate conversation. I think the real conversation is, you know, people, democracy, social movements, revolutions, take note. This is how you join the conversation. This is how you get your voice heard. No need to like take up arms, no need to be violent. Like you want to get something heard, you know, have a good video editor and a good sense of aesthetic presentation. Yeah, no shit. That's kind of amazing, isn't nothing. You know, I saw that the tweets, they started coming in, you know, this Kony Kony, Kony and I knew who the guys want. The guy was, I, I'd, I'd read about his, uh, his, his move with Africa and you saw Peter Pan.

Speaker 3:          00:08:18       It's all exactly the same as Kone. Really? Yeah. Then the Peter Pan is still the kids that go to an army and isn't that horrible though, that that actually is happening at someone. They're stealing children and forcing them to become soldiers. I mean, it's just terrifying stuff. It's really, really horrifying. Horrifying stuff. Yeah, no, it's terrible. But I do think that, you know, we're seeing violence is going down across the world. I mean this guest, Steve Pinker, and he has a Ted Talk, the myth of violence, we might have mentioned it last time. We'll say that if violence is down across the world and the chances of a man dying at the hands of another man or the lowest than they've ever been, now granted there's more people in the world and there were in the past. But proportionally the violence is a lot less. And I think as these people, you know, the rising billion in certain parts of the world coming online, getting smartphones, joining the global conversation, all of a sudden can have their voices heard.

Speaker 3:          00:09:03       And the first step to addressing the problem is, you know, making an awareness that the problem is there. So the importance of it can resonate with people. And so I think there's reason to be optimistic about even the worst of the worst. I agree. Getting, I think less worse automatically go pessimistic because things aren't perfect. You know, we look at it and we go, God, well why is there so much fucked up shit in this world? Why is there so much crime? Why is it so much violence? Why is it so much death? Why is war still here? Why is corruption still here? But what you don't realize, if you really stop and think, it's like this is the best it's ever been ever by a Goddamn long shot. Absolutely. Who's driving on the way over here today on the highway and it was a nice day here in Pasadena.

Speaker 3:          00:09:43       There was nobody on the highway. It was like easy traveling. So nice and beautiful. It's sunny out and I was thinking how fucking, how much it would have sucked to Jill live just 500 years ago to totally just 500 a blip in time. Like nothing. No cars to fucking horses. There's no, not even trails out here. You know you, you need to see there's a, there's a presentation by this guy called Hans robling, his website gapminder. He does this thing where he shows all the nations across the world over time, and how the indicators of quality of life and infant mortality rate and income and all these, all these different things, he shows that all the countries of the world, even in the worst of the worst, are rising. So the rising tide does lift everybody else. And it's unbelievable. And I think the reason that most people don't realize that things are always are getting better is because of the Amygdala.

Speaker 3:          00:10:27       Peter Diamandis did a presentation about this at the Ted conference just a week and a half ago, and he has this book called abundance. And he explained that, you know, because our brains evolved in a time where we had to have fight or flight mode, the Amygdala is always looking for danger and it supersedes everything else. And so the media gives us danger because that's what we're drawn to. You know, if it bleeds, it leads and we're always going to be paying attention to what's wrong, even when there's infinitely more things that are going right. And because the media wants to just get viewership, you know, the mainstream media will feed us what we want, which is to see all the horrible things that are happening across the world. Right. Although eventually that's actually going to be a good thing because if we can see what's wrong, we'll try to address it and try to fix it.

Speaker 3:          00:11:03       But even when we remedied 99% of the problems that exist today, our brains are still going to be seeing the new problems because that's what the brain does. The amount of time from us running from Jaguars to to to being a guy steps into a Jaguar and turns the key that the amount of time is so small. The biology has never had a chance to catch. It does not. We have pretty much the same brains as we did a hundred thousand years ago and that's, I mean a hundred thousand years ago, kind of everyone is agreeing unless you really go extreme that there was no sophisticated culture which has nothing. A hundred thousand years is nothing. It's a blame. What the fuck happened man? Language language guy into it. Last year we did get into [inaudible] playing. You really believe that that just made everything changed because we could exchange information. Yes. Well, because, because the moment that we invented, and this is where Terence Mckenna gets into, you know, kits Kurzweilian and Kevin Kelly ish and his comments is that he said that when we invented language, uh, biological evolution stopped playing the key role because it was replaced by this, you know, a cultural epigenetic type of evolution, which goes faster and faster and faster because it accrues knowledge and it builds on itself.

Speaker 3:          00:12:11       And it's not limited by the hardware of the brain, which would take billions and billions of years to change, you know? And so this cultural thing, you know, all of a sudden each brain became a neuron in a vaster global brain of a crude knowledge and intelligence that was bootstrapping on its own complexity, which is why over the last hundred thousand years it has been ex the, the cultural evolution has been accelerating exponentially. It manifested as technology, technological evolution. But what's most interesting is that this telescoping nature of it gets faster and faster and faster. So over the last hundred thousand years. Yeah. Crazy. But over the last hundred years even, it's gotten crazier than the last

Speaker 2:          00:12:48       billion. No, they say that a thousand years ago. No one could read silently. Right. There you go. They had to read by talking. They had to say the words no one could read silently. And it was actually one of the ways that some, some guy, I don't remember, some religious figure, Hamas Aquinas, maybe it's him not sure proved that he was a saint because he can resolve because he could read silently and then he would recite it. Amazing. He would look at it and not say anything. Look at the scripture, not obviously not reading, cause he wasn't speaking aloud. And then he would recite it. Wow. And that was his master of the scripture was unparalleled. It's cause he could read silently. He was like the only guy. Yeah. I don't think it's that guy though. It's like it's one of those other religious people that may or may not have ever really existed or might not have been Thomas Aquinas. I didn't want to ask Sam Harris if he believed that Jesus was a real human.

Speaker 3:          00:13:40       That was the end design guys documentary. I remember as it, he said that he probably never even existed. Well cause he shares all the same attributes as all these other gods and all these other cultures, they all die in the same age. They're all born at the same like, but isn't it also

Speaker 2:          00:13:52       possible that it could have been just a real person, but they attached all these other attributes to him because of ancient mythology I suppose. And it just says if you look at it open, just completely open. Right. But I don't know if it was a real dude, but man, you want to talk about one guy just kind of dominating religion for like thousands of years, you know? Yeah. It's like know,

Speaker 3:          00:14:13       well he became a meme. If he was at wasn't, it was no longer a person man. He became a meat, which, you know, and Richard Dawkins' book the selfish gene, he says that there was this new replicator, you know, just like jeans where the replicators they could multiply and they could evolve over time. That there was a new replicator that was born above the biosphere, new kingdom, above the biosphere and the Denisons of this kingdom, more ideas. And so he said ideas in the form of memes. They're like organisms. They've retained the properties of organisms. Even though they rise above the biosphere, they replicate, they complete each other, they mutate, they leap from brain to brain. They come, they compete for attention, you know, and he goes crazy. And you know, James Gleek wrote the book, the information says that the most, the primary building block of reality might be information before, before you know, it before matter itself. So he actually says it comes from bit matter, comes from information and that information is really what's at the core of reality. And uh, it's just an insane idea and endless cause. That goes back to the whole thing about the power to change the world. People, ideas, passions can change. The world because ideas have done more than jeans over the last hundred.

Speaker 2:          00:15:27       Well, Mckenna would always go on about the world being made of language. Yes. Which is really hard to wrap your head around, man. That was a, that was a real mind fuck because sort of, not really, but wait a minute, because two people have to communicate in order to create something new. And then you know, you thinking about infrastructure and cities, that is all a factor of language. Without language, none of this would be there. It's just, it's so hard to wrap your head around that. And I think that the, that

Speaker 3:          00:15:54       he was spot on and I think that the reason that he was spot on is because when I think when he says, okay, the world is made of language, what he's saying is we create a mental model of the world in order to understand the world. In order to speak about the world and react to the world. We create a mental model in our head and then we label those pictures in our heads, you know, symbolically. So we abstract, defy reality and therefore the way that we interface reality through the prism of our language, our thinking, our preconceptions are stereotypes. Our culture, which is what they say. We don't see the world as it is. We see the world as we are, which speaks to exactly and directly to it. I think Mckenna was saying reality is made of language. It's almost like it's why like they say that like even like thinking a happy thought, we'll start to make you happier.

Speaker 3:          00:16:36       You know, like essentially the world changes, you become happier about the world simply by thinking. It's so, and it sounds kind of like new agey and stuff, but like not really because even the object of description I think does something to influence one's perception of reality, which is just how you interpret electrical signals going through your brain anyway. And so if you're aware that reality is made of language and that we're like cocreating it with our intention, um, and something of course, which is magnified with psychedelics. That's why I've talked about set and setting being so integral to the trip because your thoughts about the trip effect the trip itself. So thoughts become reality, but we should think of our lives as one big fucking trip. Our normal baseline waking sober lives is one big heroes journey and, and it's, and it should be up to us to think of it so and so.

Speaker 3:          00:17:22       If we're all on a hero's journey, if we're all on an extended lifelong mine manifesting, which means a psychedelic trip, then we have a responsibility to sort of use words to map our reality the way that we want to be authors of our reality, of our existence, to make a masterpiece out of life. One that we would willingly live again and again for all of eternity. So it like, like what we're doing now, our conversation, it's changing the reality inside the synapses of those that are engaging with us. Just the same way we're changing each other's reality right now. You know, this is a different reality than where we were an hour ago. We're literally interfacing in a different, yeah, it's university. You don't think about it that way though. You think, well, we're just doing a podcast, a podcast in here talking shit. Yes, but your portions of your mind, the output of your mind, whether it's immaterial or not, I'm still creates tangible impact in the world.

Speaker 3:          00:18:23       Because think of light, especially like the one or five or 10 people that you might inspire to create some work of art that came out of what they heard in this conversation. And that worked of art gets licensed by a brand to create a campaign for creativity that then the government of Finland adopts in their, in their policy for education for the following year. And it should transforms the lives of the next generation of students. The Butterfly effect and transformation triggered by ideas is more powerful than, you know, I think, you know, uh, uh, then then that then of the physical world, I think you're absolutely right, especially in the age of the Internet. This is, this is the time where the ideas really can go viral almost instantaneously. Like this Kony video and there's, I mean we do, I don't even think we've really fully examine the impact possible through, you know, through, through information, especially with with the, what are kids going to be like, man, what are you know, 20 year old kids going to be like 20 years from now.

Speaker 3:          00:19:24       All Dude, just growing up in more advanced and empowered. Yeah. Way more aware. Way, way harder to bullshit. Yeah. Enabled kids. There's no crazy, they're going to look back on the nonsense that we believe today and they're going to be laughing at us. Ma'Am. Yeah. I think even the way that you know how things are voted in, you know, how people resolve issues. I think the idea of having representatives, you know, over there to, to carry our voice to Washington is obsolete because we are post geographicals beings at this point. We don't need somebody else to represent us necessarily because we can all represent ourselves and have a voice online. In fact, there's people that are talking about how, you know, we could reform or upgrade or reexamined like how government is run and how people are represented. I mean I'm talking like a little farther out, but there's this guy who's starting this thing as a friend of mine.

Speaker 3:          00:20:15       His name's Micah and uh, he used to actually be with students for sensible drug policy and now he's doing this thing called dynamic democracy, which is about starting a conversation and exploring new ways of how the Internet, the human extended nervous system that's connecting us. All right. Cause we love saying that we are all connected, we are all empowered. Well how about we upgrade the way the world is run, you know, like on a mega scale. Well we talk about it, you know? Yeah. Yeah. I mean that that essentially is what the Internet is doing, right? Yeah. The Internet. I mean I've heard people be down on the Internet and I guess you could see some negative

Speaker 4:          00:20:48       points to anonymity and there's a few aspects of pornography that are a little unseemly. It's definitely accelerated pornography. I'll tell you that things have gotten really weird man. If you want to look at like what happens to human beings when left alone to their own devices and when, when allowed to expand in a, in a contained market like pornography, there's only so many different things they can do. So they, they, they, you know, you know what the big thing is lately that I keep seeing man is girls getting guys to come in them and then they squirt it into a champagne glass and drink it and you're like really? Or a Martini glass really will look, just always ask. Just because these digital tools extended the range of our creativity, it doesn't mean that people can't use that creativity in ways we don't agree with or perhaps in bad ways because just like we use the power of fire to cook our food, we use the power of fire to burn other people, which is always a double edged sword of any expansion and extension of human reach.

Speaker 4:          00:21:48       But that's, that's still what evolution is probing for because we're all seeking out complexity. It's just going from single celled organisms, multicellular organism to beings to thinking beings to beings who create technology. And so on and so forth. So it's all happening anyway. So people say it's not going to stop. It's part of evolution. But yes, we have to acknowledge that these tools are double edged sword and that's fine. That's part of it. What makes people really like doing that? That's possible too. Right? I like Billy, a woman out there that actually likes to get dudes to shoot loads and, and then she squirts them out into a glass. It is very possible. And who am I to judge right now? Shit. Shit that you like. Hey, people can do whatever they want as long as they're not hurting anybody else. It's, you know, it's just weird that porn is accelerated to this, to what it is today.

Speaker 4:          00:22:32       A porn was not just porn for a longest time and know you'd heard rumors of like snuff films or something crazy, but no one ever saw one. Did you ever see a snowfall, Brian and uh, yeah, it seems snuff films. We've seen people die on the inner war now. Real life. Yeah. It's disturbing. But I don't even know if those are real half the time now. I remember when nine inch nails had a snuff film out called broken. It was like, they advertise it like as this bootleg video and you'd rent it and it looked like somebody murdering somebody else. It was kind of like faces of death. Oh Wow. And that's terrible man. And everyone thought it was a snuff film. There have been real films, man, for real. There was a documentary on it a while back. Um, and that's terrible. Yeah. And the guy who was the, uh, one of the, one of the people that were interviewing was talking about watching this film. And as he's talking about watching the film, he starts crying. Wow. That's pretty intense. Yeah. He's, he's obviously a pretty fucked up by it, you know, I remember maybe he didn't cry. Definitely got choked up. He was like, just thinking about watching this. He just a broad spectrum of human behavior, man. It's got a, we've got a five piece stata. Is there a way or is it necessary to have negative in order to influence positive? I mean, is that a know if that's necessary? I think that was know that the there that

Speaker 3:          00:23:46       has been something that perhaps has worked for some people you know to to you, you got to know what bad is in order to know what good is. You know, the contrast. But it doesn't mean that we come up, come up, come up with some more novel solution that allows us to live, you know, cause if according to that idea that we need the bad in order to know the good, it means that it implies that we're always, we need to have suffering to appreciate, you know, when we're not suffering. I don't think that's the case

Speaker 2:          00:24:08       too. But if you look at things as being natural, you look at everything as being natural, like wolf behavior, be behavior or look at all this stuff as being natural and, and in, in and positive towards whatever their goal is. Whether their goal is to create this beehive that they create, whether their goal is to create an ant hill. When you look at human society may be what we're doing as natural as well. And maybe we're so fucking chaotic and so crazy because you sorta have to be to be working with technology that's so far and ahead what your biology is capable of processing. So we have this fucking wacky tribal monkey shit going on while we have nuclear power, while we have Adam,

Speaker 3:          00:24:50       there's there, there's a lot going on. And you know, increasingly people are moving into their own personal universes and soundscapes and when we have virtual reality, then we each become the God in our own universe at that point. You know, an infinity of combinations and permutations of lifestyles will be explored by individual individuated nervous systems living out in the atmosphere of the inner web. You know, um, so who the fuck knows? But uh, but at that point we won't care what that person does in their own virtual universe. Like the porn is going to be awesome. It's going to be gross gross ever properly grocer balut ponds where it's like it's shoved in the vagina for a week and then pull it out and somebody eats it or something. Why? I hope not. I hope, I hope. I hope it actually becomes about like composing and creating the greatest dream we have ever dreamed to make greater art than we've ever experienced.

Speaker 3:          00:25:43       To create better designer, designer drugs, engaged with our senses and make us appreciate art and ways that we couldn't have before to merge with our lovers to become one with them. I mean, we use language to connect and say how we feel to one another. That's one emerge all the time. What do they want to, you want to do, man? What he like? You want to go hang out with your boy? It's gonna. You can't want to go play pool, but what if your boys want to merge? The boys want to merge with you and your wife. You won't be playing pool though you and wants to merge with your lunch. It's like, hey man, can I merge with your wife? That's weird. So I see what it's like to be heard. They want to merge with your kids, whatever they can copy and sexual life. It's not sexual. No, no, no. What do they want to merge with a dolphin? Because they want to know what it's like to be a Dyson. Timothy

Speaker 2:          00:26:25       leary settle the fuck down. Merging with dolphins and people. Yeah. What if right. That's this guy. We have to define like once if we do create something that allows like the human consciousness to merge, to interface with something, we're going to have to like really define what's happening there so people don't, whether it's going to be Hershel interest,

Speaker 5:          00:26:44       I just don't see. You can see like Nancy Grace on TV. Who is this man that he's merging with a 14 year old girl in Florida. Three tickets. You tell me that's appropriate that this man is merged. What does a grown man haven't calm and with the thinking of a 14 year old girl,

Speaker 4:          00:27:10       she gets a little wetter every time there's a dead baby in Florida. Every time something happens in Florida, she's like, Oh yes. More programming, more material. You know? I have to say the fact that we see so much, can't she find nice things? Can Nancy grace please? I'm not picking on you because I have to them a comedian. K You just find one nice story. Yeah. Need, we need, we need more programming. That's uplifting. Yeah. Isn't it nice to see stuff that makes you feel good about humanity? Good to have people go after bad people. Don't get me wrong, they're stopping the crime and preventing getting along. But absolutely. As far as like what we project our issue is that there's 7 billion people on this planet and if you only want to pay attention to negative shit, you can find enough to fill every second of every day, every second of every day of every moment that you are on this planet.

Speaker 4:          00:28:01       It's someone's getting Jack. Yes. But I'm saying I think people are reacting to that by creating more and more really inspiring content. And I think corporations now all, I want it to align themselves with having a sort of a positive impact on the world. You know, they're saying there's more to to a corporation than just making money. How about wanting to make a social life, but I think it is becoming part of it, part of our consciousness. Our increasingly like this is what you're hearing. I mean, you had Pepsi do that campaign last year and they, they're, they're all, they're realized. I, my point was that, hold on, but my point was that you have to manage your own interaction with this kind of information. My point was that if you so choose, you can be around it all day, every day or you can just not, and you can force yourself into more positive places and the options available that both options are available.

Speaker 4:          00:28:50       Absolutely. You, you have to be kind of careful and how you manage your consciousness because you, you really can freak yourself the fuck out if you only chose to concentrate on all the negative things in this world is too much information. Totally. You know, and, and you, you could drown and information, especially because the new limited resources our attention. But I think it's interesting. There's a book about this, it's called the information diet and it says that it's really up to us to take responsibility over our information diet, to set up curators, to set up certain filters to, to sort of, you know, to have a significant say in how we interface with media. And we have that opportunity now that we didn't have before when it was just two channels, it was on or off. Now there's a billion options. Curate author, create an experience and information diet that will keep you mentally invigorated. Just like there's also food diet will keep you a lot of experimenting on too. You

Speaker 1:          00:29:41       know, there's also a lot of people trying different things out and focusing on different things and there's a lot of misses that seemed like they were hits. Like you remember when everybody was into the secret? Yeah. You remember that and everybody was convinced that all you have to do is think positive and just draw a picture of the house you want on your wall. And one day it'll sort of manifest itself in yes. Secret fans. Yes. I'm just paraphrasing. Yeah. But don't you think that an example, like the way you said it is probably a lot of people literalized the message without really thinking about it a little deeper and understanding how, it might not sound like just bull here's, but here's the problem with the secret. Some of it's real. Okay. There is a certain amount. It's one of the ingredients and making something happen.

Speaker 1:          00:30:29       And one of the ingredients is vision. It's 100% there's one of the ingredients, and you talked to anybody that has some sort of a great success and a good percentage of them, at least some of them are sorta gotten their vision along the way, but a good percentage of them had a vision and followed it. Right. Push. That is true. But there's so much other shit involved. Education, hard work, discipline. It's not a set thing. Cuing because it's like everything. Everything out in the world. Everybody's, you know, the most magnificent artifact from the iPhone to the jet engine is actualized from a thought, from a dream, from a design, which means to say, we, we constructed the virtual version before we constructed the actual virgin, right? That's the same thing as visualizing something into being. But the, into being part is when you say, okay, I'm going to go execute on this.

Speaker 1:          00:31:13       I'm going to go like, you know, I'm going to move through space and time, move my atoms through space and time and go construct the thing and go lobby to build the thing, to build the dream, to actualize the goal. And I think maybe people who read the read the book without reading as deeply enough into it what they thought it was like, okay, I'm just going to sit on a couch and dream something that's going to come knocking on my door. So the problem is that they're dealing with a bunch of people who have had success and when people have had success and you know, they all tell you the same story, Oh, I knew it was going to happen. And I dreamed it. Well, but that's because it happened. You know? I, you know what I'm saying? There's a lot of shit that comes along the way.

Speaker 1:          00:31:47       You could've gotten so random car accident. It could have got hit by a fucking media. Absolutely. I'm not exactly sure if 100% of your success is based on the fact that you focused on your dream. Right. I think it's a percentage of the sec success, but there's a lot of luck involved there too. Oh yeah, 100% Oh yeah. There's a lot of, there's a lot of luck involved in every, I mean like the fact that each of us is here, we beat out billions of sperm. We've already are. All of us are living against the odds. Every respect for luck I think is one of the reasons why people get lucky or respect for luck. You know, you gotta respect. Luck is, you know, fortune good fortune is unquestionably an ingredient. There's an ingredient in there and I feel like if Karma is real in any form, I believe that's where the most evidence of it being real is.

Speaker 1:          00:32:34       That to me. Then the people that I know that are the most fortunate or also the kindness are the most generous. Those are the people that are the most fortunate because if one's a win for themselves as well, which is a very critical point with a lot of people mess up. They're super nice to other people, but they treat themselves like shit that to their body, like shared no good. They don't go after their own goals. They don't trace their own dreams. They'll let people abuse them because they're too nice. I mean, there's a lot of people that are not nice to themselves. You've got to be as nice to yourself as you are to other people. I totally, that is a huge part of the equation that a lot of people miss out on. They're like, I'm a good person. I'm nice to people.

Speaker 1:          00:33:09       Yeah, but you hate yourself. You know, you hate your body. You hate your mind, and you can do, not everybody can do you. You can do more for her, for the world, I think. Um, by treating yourself with the same kindness that you treat other people and, uh, once a sickness not to absolutely. Food is fucking delicious, but you shouldn't eat yourself to death, you know, I'm not saying you have to look like Kate Moss in her prime. Where'd I put out that reference from? Where was that? But you know, you know, you don't have to, you know, you don't have to fucking eat yourself to death either. Right. You know, that's, there's a lot of people that eat themselves to death. Like the human mind can go terribly wrong. It can go on a horrible path and just get stuck there. Just get stuck. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:33:54       Yeah. But the thing is, when we have that problem with software, you know, software gets corrupted or if it gets a bad virus in it, you know, we can, we can upgrade and reboot the system and we're not so lucky. Biology. What if someone did something horrible like a, there was a, you know, a mall shooting or something and some guy goes to the mall, just shoots random people. Okay. Then you reboot them. Would you allow that guy? Do you think that's okay in a civilized society? Do you think we have to reboot, reboot him and that's a great philosophical question to ask. I mean that's, that's a different case study. I was doing blame society and allowing him to get to a point where his software failed him and how do we approach that if we, if it's effective, if it's real, do we blame the tissue that's left after we remove his consciousness?

Speaker 1:          00:34:36       Do we blame that tissue and say, I'm sorry, this tissue has to die to make up for the 16 people who knows? Maybe, maybe, maybe there will be some form of light. There will be an ethical dilemmas like a virtual reality psychedelic experience where you take him down the rabbit hole and he has a Joseph Campbell's hero's journey and he collides with his own cosmic nakedness and then emerge is rehabilitated. Maybe we'll have like, sounds like it'll download rehabilitation. Yeah. Electronic Iowasca use that Ag. You tweet across that. That would be a way to, you should grab a criminal and he should put him in an Iowasca session with a shaman to stare into the nakedness of his own soul. This is my new show. My next show that I'm working on, nobody's bought it yet, but I've got some hopes. It's called Douche bags on mushrooms and that's the show. We chose the lunch bags throughout the world and we just bring him somewhere and dose up with like five grams a mushroom. It was to let them see themselves. I mean, nobody's going to die. I think psychedelic therapy is so spot on, like in terms of the, the psychic read justments that can happen in one session could take years

Speaker 4:          00:35:39       and given it to people. Yeah, giving it to criminals as part of a rehabilitation, if that would be very interesting to explore. It just sounds very fast. Not even just criminals, but people that have issues like alcoholism. That's obvious. I mean they just came out with a study just now that said that LSD could help people get over Alco as in one session. Yeah. It doesn't have to say about the Russian doing tests on this. In the 60s, in the 1960s for they had determined that 500 micrograms was enough to cure like more than 70% of chronic alcohol, uh, patients that came in and tried acid just from like looking at the situation just completely differently being separated from the nonsense of what you're engaged in. Yeah. We get stuck in these weird patterns. It's very strange. It's almost like a byproduct of our ability to focus on things, right?

Speaker 4:          00:36:24       We have this ability to become intense and obsessed and focused on things in a positive sense. But there's a byproduct of that and that by side effects obsession, it's a glitch. Yeah, it's a, it's a possible, you know, it's, it's like if somebody gives you a fucking Ferrari but you don't know how to drive a stick shift and you sort of figure it out along the way and you're jamming gears and fucking things up. Sometimes it's working well and some things you don't understand how to use the system and they could be just that. You know when you see a kid that becomes obsessed with jerking off, you know, get them into a sport, maybe become a fucking world champion. You know, maybe he's just one of those kids that just whatever he focuses on, he focuses on insanely, it does a lot of kids out there and I'm not saying you're wasting your life playing video games because video games are awesome.

Speaker 4:          00:37:04       They've, they didn't improve one's brain but a bunch of studies about how gaming, like coordination and cooperation. But what I'm saying is that these kids, any kid that gets really good at a video game, you can get really good at anything. You can get really good at it. If you, if you put that kind of focus that you put to get fucking awesome at call of duty, you could really, you know, you could have, you could have a better life. You could imagine you getting tricky unification on nurses where you can play these games to address real social challenges in these gamers will probably find solutions to problems that engineers couldn't in the real world that this is happening more and more now to use the resources of gamers to gamify a real world problem. How does that work? Well, because the reality, they'll create like some some interface and some some problem and they're just like a game and you get points for solving issues related to the gamers discovered like some antibody for some crazy virus.

Speaker 4:          00:37:55       People can Google this for gamers. Gamers solve some illness like crazy stuff and you're going to be seeing that more and more. In fact, they, they did this crowd sourcing crowd sourcing experiment about a protein folding and you know the world's best protein folder is who can fold in design proteins in the virtual space is like a woman who does it in her free time in the UK and during the day she was like a receptionist or something and she is the world's best protein folder. She used to do it on her computer at night. Yeah, yeah, cause you crowdsource that what clay Shirky calls the cognitive surplus. It's all this extra brain activity, protein folding. What is she doing? It's some kind of craft source softwares thing. They less people like fold proteins and you know, and you can figure out how to do it in the virtual

Speaker 3:          00:38:36       space and then it can be applied in real life. And it turns out that the best one in the world was this woman in the UK and all the scientists in the world. Yeah, yeah. She's just a lady with a regular yeah, yeah, yeah. And you're going to find that more and more. There's going to be some Gamer, you know in Budapest who was going to fix world hunger. You know like wow, look at, look, look, look at like, like hackers hacking community. Like these little 13 year olds are hacking fucking Microsoft. Yeah, exactly. 13 year old heck the UFC. Yeah, exactly. Yeah, yeah, yeah. They're bad asses. Did you hear about Lola Sec guy? Is that how you call Lowe's turn? He ratted out like all these anonymous guys, like 26 anonymous cause he just grabbed it out everybody to the FBI. Just just because like I guess the FBI was playing dirty and it was like saying, hey, we're going to arrest you for ever.

Speaker 3:          00:39:22       You never got to see your kids ever. You know, and they, the FBI actually admitted to it and I interviewed at that. That's what they used their kids again. So what are the, what were they guilty of? Hacking, you know, digital terrorism May, you know, and they were like, they broke it into some serious websites. Right. That's like somebody said recently it was, it's a higher form than terrorism. Oh, that does cyber terrorism second to higher than somebody's like, well, I have a good friend, this guy, Mark Goodman, he's at singularity university over in Silicon Valley where they look at how these emerging technologies are, well this, there's a singularity university. Hell yeah, dude, you need to go, man. I just did their executive program here in La. It was at Fox studios and it was hosted by the head of Fox, the chairman James, Jim Giannopoulos. And it was the founder, Peter Diamandis and Kurzweil.

Speaker 3:          00:40:08       They have people from all over the world, like the most interesting, smart people, diplomats, actors, technologists, business people to learn about exponentially emerging technologies and how they can be addressed to solve humanity's grand challenges. And you know, like the homework there, everybody that comes out has to come up with an idea that can help a billion people. Cause the, the notion is that technology and our tools now allow individuals to knew what, what to do, what at one time could only be done by governments, you know what I'm saying? Or, or, or people with extreme resources. But yeah, singularity university had an executive program and, and they had talks about all the amazing stuff going on, but also this Guy Mark Goodman talked about like cyber terrorism and new forms of obviously synthetic biology used in bad ways. And the, that it's a conversation that needs to be had because human nature, human beings have a good ability to foresee problems.

Speaker 3:          00:40:50       And so we should start addressing those problems before they become a serious issue so that we can enjoy all the fruits and benefits that are coming from these emerging technologies. But at the same time take responsibility for obviously what is a double edged sword as always, or the aliens land first before we'd get our shit together. Right. Well and then we've got a problem. Actually we should talk about aliens. I have a fucking crazy idea to tell you. Okay, Tom, ready for this? You guys heard of the trends sension hypothesis? No, I have not. Okay, so I just found out about this last night I knew was, it's a hypothesis by this guy called John Smart. He's an accelerating specialist futurist over in Silicon Valley that tries sension hypothesis hypothesis is an answer to Fermi's paradox, which is if the universe is so vast and there's all these other plan is to have added so much more time to develop intelligent life, how can we don't see it everywhere, right?

Speaker 3:          00:41:39       Like that's Fermi's paradox I'm told. And the trend hypothesis says that if you look at what's happening with technological progress as we head towards the singularity is the dematerialization and miniaturization of, of complexity so that there's more energy per second per gram going through a microchip than there is in the surface of the sun. The most complex thing in the universe that we know of right now is the human being. So complexity gets more complex but also gets denser. So what they call stem, right? And so what does stem again, tell me what it stands for. Uh, anyway, I'll remember. But anyway, his brother. Yeah, no, no, no. But what happens is he says that eventually this exponentially growing technology and when we start talking about nanotechnology and putting intelligence into the nanoscale, that we're going to eventually create an artificial black hole and disappear into it and slingshot into the future because there's going to be so much density and so much complexity is so much information that eventually is going to create a rupture through space time and we're going to disappear into it.

Speaker 3:          00:42:33       So we're just going to do that just by density of information. Too many hard drives in one spot at one time, yo, because he says that the computation event works by shrinking things and complexity gets smaller and smaller and smaller as the computer chips get faster and faster and faster and more powerful. And we look at the complexity that's an, an iPhone today is a million times cheaper, a million times smaller, thousand nine more powerful than half a building in size was 40 years ago. So in a hundred years, imagine the complexity that is going to be in something smaller than an atom or even scales beyond that. So when our minds, when intelligence is residing on those scales, basically they're saying that eventually we're not going to colonize outer space. We're going to go into the interspace, we're going to go smaller and smaller and smaller in density until we literally create the ultimate universal computer, which is a black hole.

Speaker 3:          00:43:16       Does everybody have to do this or can we, can we opt out, compete people off? Raise the idea. I don't know if I explained it very well. Sidelines. I've been saying for years that I think the people responsible for the big bang. There you go. There you go. Well, the big bank could have been birthed from a previous universe that eventually achieved the transection and disappeared into a black hole. So recess. I think that's why we're so fascinated with technology. We eventually hit a point where we figure something out and we press a button and we disappear into a black hole, which is worth as a big bang in a new universe. The whole idea of the big bang is really fucking amazing because it's amazing that science ever would come up with a theory like the big bang. It's almost like they had to have a theory.

Speaker 3:          00:43:53       So this was the best one. The universe is constantly expanding. There's um, there's some radio waves from 14 billion years ago. We're detecting, we believe that it was a big explosion. Let's just run with this. Yeah. And the idea that at one point in time, 14 whatever billion years ago, the universe was so small, it was more than the head of a pin. Everything. Higher universe. That is that is that, well that, but that was going the other direction and I just remembered what the stem acronym stands for. It's space, time, matter and energy. Space, time, matter and energy. Shrink, stem. Then space, time, energy and matter. Oh, okay. My bad. Yeah. Spacetime energy matter, man. Compressor compresses. As technology

Speaker 4:          00:44:32       progresses, so there's less space and less time and the things are smaller and a and less energy going through that matter and also less matter. So that's the move towards density. It's like a reverse big bag. Giving me a fucking headache. Yeah, it's, it's, it's really ridiculous. If I was correct, I have, I'm sure I'm not the only one who's ever thought this up by the way. I think when you look at, you know, look at nuclear bombs and need just nuclear power in general, the fact that, you know, where we control most of our power and major cities is controlled by these nutty fucking nuclear explosions that they've contained of exposures with it. Yeah. Could reaction that they've contained in the area. And if the power goes out, like if it goes to Japan, everyone's fucked. Do you have to run? Everybody said get away from that and it's doom for a hundred thousand years.

Speaker 4:          00:45:14       This, that alone, just that alone makes me think like, wow, like I know I don't have any better options. No I don't, but this is all you guys. Got You guys. I mean in the 1960s and seventies this is what you figured out. You figured out how to make nuclear power that if the power goes off it just eats right through the earth and then everyone's fucked anywhere near it. No, but isn't it mind blowing? What a mind, what minds can do? Like that's incredible. I think of the scale that we are like how small and dense a mind is a thinking being. The amount of synaptic connections inside of something as small as the brain is as many galaxies as there are in the universe, like that amount of complexity in something so small is what we are. So it's like people say, Oh, we're so insignificant.

Speaker 4:          00:45:58       I think we're like really significant. You know what I mean? Like we're the cutting edge of design. We'll get to that has emerged from the university. I agree and I don't. At the same time I said, yes, we were very, we're very significant if it comes to change on this earth, but the earth is just so God damn small and the big picture, it's ridiculous to say that were significant, were so fucking timing, but just talk about the whole universe and literally play back the evolution of the universe in our heads. A capacity, a capacity to understand events that have occurred over deep time, not just plain it, right? So we're creating internet, we're creating models on the scale of that universe. The universe that you're saying is so much bigger than we are. We're creating internal models of it inside of our heads. True.

Speaker 4:          00:46:40       We're fitting the universe in our head as far as brought virtual conversations about it, or that's what's fucking crazy, which means it fits in our heads. That design fits in our heads. If we understand it correctly, the smartest people in the world, Einstein among them, could probably contemplate it in his head. And you know, people who take psychedelics say that they experience the entire universe at once. Maybe they do. Yeah. Maybe they do. Maybe it's all inside a mushroom. You could see the whole thing. You just got to take enough home. Yeah. Well cause the universe expands outwards. But it goes inwards to you. This, this, this scales get smaller. There's an entire universe inside of us. 10 trillion, trillion, trillion atoms. And apparently the scales, the scales go smaller in the most Adams. It's just space. Like give her, you know, when you look, you've already told me about that the other night.

Speaker 4:          00:47:24       Most of, most of everything is mostly empty space. Most of us parents mostly up mostly empty space, which is patterned integrity, man pattern integrity's. It's so insane to just even try to wrap your head around how complex the whole thing really, truly is. Right? Which is why people like sticking to neighborhoods and watching the same shows they want. Anything that calms down this bizarre feeling of never ending complexity, you know, that it's impossible to understand or be in control of your universe. Well, it's frightening to live in the mystery, to live on the edge of knowledge, to live on the edge of thought. Well there's a reason we call it the edge cause there it looks like there's a ravine on the other end. But I still think even though as individuals, some of us find that frightening and to each his own as a collective, I think mankind is always restless and never afraid of the edge.

Speaker 4:          00:48:15       I think mankind always pushes at the edge and that's what makes me ultimately so optimistic about humanity. We're still here and it's getting crazy and look at the stuff that humanity is talking to itself about. Yeah, about bombing Iran to man. There's, it's going both ways. I hit correcting global organisms, so maybe we're just self, we're self correcting. I agree with you. I don't grow share and your optimism because I'm continually fascinated by the stupidity of the human race as well as the intelligence of it. I think you can't ignore it. I mean you cannot ignore that. There's a lot of dummies out there, unfortunately. Totally a big percentage of the world's a fucking mess right now. And a lot of those people, a big percentage, but I just think that what is a mess gets magnified and brought to our attention. Well, it's more than 1%, right?

Speaker 4:          00:49:01       More than 1% of the world's in mass, I would say. When you say, when you think about Iraq, Afghanistan, what's going on in Syria, which has happened in Libya, what's going on in Egypt? There's a lot of things about this that are very exciting, right? I mean what happened in Libya and Indonesia, no, don't get me wrong, but I'm saying you're saying it's a mess. There's a at one commission, right? Yeah. We're, we looked at more than 1% and you've got a hundred people in a room and one of them is fucking crazy. I think we live in disruptive times. Yes. Fueled by these accelerating technologies. But I think disruption, it's like going through the birth canal. It's like, it's like, you know, when Timothy Leary, it says that we're about to like, you know, shed our skin. You know, we're in the larval stage. We were pre larval of men were larval, and then we're just, we're about to spread our wings potentially.

Speaker 4:          00:49:49       Potentially. That's where this conversation comes in. If some new age, Hitler doesn't step into the equation. Fair enough. But damn it. But a good conversation to have. Yes. Oh yeah, of course. It's amazing when you really look back at World War II, that it was such a short amount of time ago. It's terrifying. It's hard to wrap your head around that. I'm Jewish. I know. It's w did you have family? That was my family fled from Europe. Yeah, my mother's side Polish and Russian. Yeah. Um, there was a Venezuela, Ari interviewed a bunch of, wasn't as dad and, well, I don't want to say, let's see. But yeah, it's, it's incredible that that's inside. That could, that could be your grandparents. That could be our lifetime. That's within our, within our grasp

Speaker 2:          00:50:28       right now. While you know this chain of life is going on, the Holocaust was happening, World War II was happening. I mean the storming the beaches of Normandy, that's like the most savage shit in human history. You know, cutting people down with machine guns as they run through the sand. I mean, that is, that's our lifetime man. It's amazing. Some really truly amazing. When you stop and think about how crazy that seems. Yeah,

Speaker 3:          00:50:50       yeah. There was a really interesting article that I read because obviously everything you're saying is very upsetting. It was informed policy, man. Just stop talking, dude. It's cool. No, I'm saying no, no, no, no, no, no. But there was an article in foreign policy magazine, it was called V end of war, and it was one of those counterintuitive articles that you read it and you're like, okay, there's these interesting academics that are saying, yes, this was tragedy. Yes, there've been horrible things. Yes, these numbers, these scales are horrific, but put it in context over deeper, longer time, and what you see is that things are getting better, less wars happening. Just before we couldn't cover every war on TV. There were too many conflicts zones in the world, but he talks about how there's less and less. It's just it's important to get the other side that we don't forget that

Speaker 2:          00:51:37       I'm sure that it's better now than it has been ever, but as a, I think human beings as just naturally, we look at the errors and the issues that we have and we see a lot of them that are sort of legacy that aren't there or aren't corrected and they'd been going on for so long. Like war. Yeah. I remember when I was a kid I was, I dunno maybe like I think it was like eight or something like that. When the government pulled out of Vietnam and the Vietnam War was over and I remember thinking like, it's good. It's done. We're done having wars because now people realize that we don't like war. No one's going to go to war anymore. Look what I remember as even as a child with the idea in my head that I was watching the culture evolved past war.

Speaker 2:          00:52:16       I had like a real sense, especially I think when you're a child because as you're growing and you're kind of experiencing life and it's being sort of explained to you along the way through experiences that you, you start getting an idea that that's how the whole world works. That things just get better over time. Things get smarter, they improve. Cause that's what you're doing. You're eight years old, you're smarter than you were when you were five. Right. You know what I'm saying? I may not have a significant leap over, you know who you are when you're, so I think that's how I viewed the world and our member in whatever year it was, 91 or 92 when we, uh, when we went to Desert Storm, what year was that? 91, right? Ma, maybe whatever. Remember might even been 89, but whatever year it was. I remember watching that happen. I remember me and my, my buddy Jimmy that I used to live with my roommate Jim, to tell yo what's up to him. Uh, we were sitting in front of the TV and they were showing missiles like firing over into Baghdad. And I remember watching that call, what the fuck? And he looks at me and he goes, we're a war buddy. We're at war. Like, well, that didn't even make sense.

Speaker 3:          00:53:16       Well, because it seems obsolete compared to all the great things that are happening in the world. Right. The massive collaboration, the massive cooperation, you know, people doing things increasingly for free for one another. Online

Speaker 4:          00:53:25       people coming together, people protesting against dictatorships, Twitter being used as fueled for dissent and discontent. I mean, there's so many encouraging trends. Yeah. Whenever use kind of contemplate the fact that there's still bad things out there. You really well you want, the contrast also makes you realize why there's aspects of us that are so obsolete. We need a firmware upgrade, but we're fucking, we're getting there. You're there to universities. What you need to go, man, I'm sure they loved that. You need to go. Yeah, we had, we actually will. I am. Was there really? Yeah. And Him and he did a talk in a panel. We had this company that does a, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute. We'll I am, gets to talk at the singular singularity university. Haman the head of Fox. What does he's talking about the head. Well, because he was talking about using these technologies and her bitches on the creative and good uses of these technologies and how we need to spread these technologies to those that are less, uh, less lucky than we are and whatnot.

Speaker 4:          00:54:12       I'm sure he was talking about nice things. So I just, I was at your jokes and we saw it too. Paralyzed people walk this bionics company who makes these like exoskeleton scene though demonstrated to paralyzed people standing up and walking. I mean, it was, it was really intense. I've seen that very much. So skeleton, it's fucking nuts. Again, it's like something right out of a marvel comics man. Hopefully. Right? It looks like a trailer for a movie that takes place in the future. That's showing you how we got there. Archival footage from the future. It just totally makes sense, right? I mean it's, it's the future. They're going to figure out, well, they're going to figure out artificial bodies. Absolute for sure. They're going to be able to put your head on someone else's body. Dude, on an artificial avatars, what? Isn't there a wired magazine story about the man who wants to build the real avatar?

Speaker 4:          00:54:52       Could you imagine if they get so good at surgery that they build an artificial you and the the head is open and they just have to sew it up and stuff. Your brain in there, but they only have like a certain amount of time where they could take your brain then reattach it. They open your the good eye. Good Eye, Mr. Jones. Boom. Oh, cut up. Next thing I see you're going to be 20 years old and invincible. They cut open your fucking brain, suck it out real quick and they only have a couple minutes and then they screw it into this new brain. What it turn it on? Fire Up is to Jones. You hear as Mr. Jones 37 seconds. We're good. We're good. You got a new life. Mr. Jones made the trip into a synthetic body with his biological brain? Well, I think by the time that we can do that, we will be non biological in the sense that we'll have far greater than human intelligence and sentients residing in decentralized non biological substrates.

Speaker 4:          00:55:39       Do you feel like that about the Nano scale? Do you feel like that? I've never felt like we're going to go to other planets. I feel we definitely are. We're definitely are. We're going to go to Mars and less than 10 years. And what did he like? Elon Musk and his one which was saying, let me in office. You hear that? Yes. New Greenridge said if you let me an office, but a second term we'll have a base on the moon. Well, we don't need governments for that. See, that's the difference of where we are now. It's going to happen by private space flight. It's going to be the techno philanthropists like Elon Musk who have the vision and the resources to make it happen and they benefit from the emerging technologies because something that was that the cost was impossible 20 years ago. All of a sudden he gives me to miniaturize is infinitely more affordable. Uh, we're, we're going to space and then we're going to send artists into space and that will transform the human. Can we have to decide like

Speaker 2:          00:56:24       who the artists are cause last thing you want is shitty poetry from outer space.

Speaker 3:          00:56:27       Well imagine you. It's got to be like really analyzing it philosophically. A podcast from space. How that would influence your thoughts, your ideas. How about we just get a green screen, it puts some space behind me and maybe that will work and we'll pretend to be the same NASA suits. Do you have any NASA soup, Brian? Yep. Minds in the trunk.

Speaker 2:          00:56:46       Yeah, I know. I don't know man. I don't know what the future holds but I think the big bang machine may come before space travel. I mean I'm just guessing the big bang machine, they might press the big bank button before we figure out how to get to other planets. And I hope

Speaker 3:          00:56:59       all man, we have to at least figure out how to back ourselves.

Speaker 2:          00:57:01       What if you fucking fly out to bars? But if you fly out tomorrow's and it's just like the shittiest parts of Arizona, it's just like the shittiest parts of the Arizona desert and you're like, you know what? The spots like this that suck on America, I could have just driven there. I didn't have to fucking fly in a rocket ship to some place with no air to see a shitty part of the, of the universe that I could've seen an Arizona rock desert areas where there's no one for 100,000 fucking square miles.

Speaker 3:          00:57:30       Yeah, Dude, fair enough. And I think that those that go are not going to swim on Mars has beautiful beaches. I think they're going for the feeling that they will have when they look out that window and see another celestial body. They're going there for the wanderlust, the awe. They're going there for the all that. That's their religious feeling getting off on God. Anybody that does

Speaker 2:          00:57:56       that who really, if they'd really do choose to give up essentially years and years of their lives to for the scientific adventure, I mean that's what they're doing. What's going to take like six months to just to get to Mars. That's a real hero. And there's going to be a lot of one way tickets, like you're saying, that's a real hero. And who knows, by the way, what the fuck happens to your body out there and radiation and deep space, how unhealthy it is to be in the atmosphere and, and you know, and then what are they going to do? They're going to have to do some sort of, uh, what, what is it called when you change the atmosphere of a new planet, uh, with terraform? Terraform. Oh yeah. They'd have to tear a form. So they would have to build machines that actually create oxygen and yeah. And then hope it stays stable,

Speaker 3:          00:58:35       although, but you want to go a little crazier man a little farther into the future. That will all be done with nanotechnology. The physicist Freeman Dyson says, we'll be able to have the entire biosphere of the world decoded the genome of the entire biosphere, of everything that's living on planet earth and something that's a few micro grams in weight and at the Nano scale. And we'll be able to send those nanotechnology instructions to self replicate and seed the universe and a whole rant about it because she's a physicist talking about this. Like this is a thing. It's not like some like, you know, hippie tripping. This is a physicist who's, you know, at one time was probably a hippie tripping.

Speaker 2:          00:59:08       It makes sense when you think about how small data holding, you know, little little, little hard drives now and what they're going to be liked. I mean they've, they've got computers that are as small as a grain of sand now. Oh Dude. Quantum is going to be

Speaker 4:          00:59:22       doing super position, which means like being one in zero at the same time. Yeah. What does that, what is that exactly? Does anybody, do you understand it? Uh, I'm no expert but super position means that can be in motion and still at the same time it's just a novice. Yes. Yeah. Two different places at once. Something could be a particle and a wave at the same time. And so it can, something can be at the same time in two different points in the universe and simultaneously and communicate, and this is not horse shit, right? This is all of this stuff. This is all proven stuff at least accepted in the quantum physics communities. Doesn't that make you want to toss all previous notions about reality aside? When you look at something like that and you go, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute. The very foundation of everything that we see, touch, feel, observe, no exists is illusory.

Speaker 4:          01:00:14       It's a goddamn program. Yeah Dude. It's the fucking matrix. Yeah. There's my friend. Rarely. Rarely is real. Matrix didn't go far enough. The Matrix didn't go far enough. It was so brilliant and that's why inception was similarly on those same, the same. There's a make a friend has a shirt, it has these two guys sitting in a chair and one of them says, are we just graphics on an imaginary tee shirt? And the other guy says, that's ludicrous. But you could extend that and extrapolate that to us. Or we just like two dudes and some virtual simulation that somebody else is playing with and then you're like, Nah, and then it zooms out and it shows like that were playing on some screen for someone else's energy. The game was really good, which is what's happening right now. When you, when you're playing like a really good game of quake, you know?

Speaker 4:          01:00:56       You know when you're in the zone you're not thinking, Hey, I'm playing quake. Oh no, he's real. You're locked. Hopping and moving. You're a part of it. We can be in multiple realities, dude. There's no doubt. We're already doing it with flat screens that are not even that immersive and we can lose ourselves in. It is artificial. It could be just so good it feels. Yeah, which makes sense for a lot of shit. I said so many times that the world feels like a piece of fiction that the word they, the reality when a guy like, you know what? When I yelled, shut the fuck up at the TV when that Anthony Wiener guy got caught taking pictures of his deck, I'm like, come on man. This is shitty writings. Shitty, right Sitcom. I'd get mad. Well, you know that's a movie. Yeah. Movie about a guy that's criticizing the screenplay of life starring you would be really fun.

Speaker 4:          01:01:43       It was. It wasn't, it wasn't that I was criticizing it was that it was like Coen brothers ass. Yeah. It was so preposterous that it seemed like all of a sudden we're in a movie. Come on, dude. But the six pictures of his cock to, they're just lose the money and clues are everywhere, man. Row, row, row your boat. What does that mean? Well, the last line of row, row, row your boat, it says life is but a dream, but a dream. Yeah. But they're early in their life is but a dream. They'd probably had a write, make something wrong. Not The pursuit of a dream. Life is not the pursuit of a dream. And there there's clues everywhere, man. Yeah. Or someone could have been really high when they wrote that. Yeah. It, Jesus wrote that

Speaker 3:          01:02:20       song. Yeah. I've written a lot of shit high that I embarrassed about. Yeah. Like your one joke. Yeah, it's true. I really did write that. That's funny. Um, so what, what do we do to, to sort of, I mean, I guess what we're doing is what you're doing right now, what we're doing, what we can do as in worked creating memes. Yeah. And we, what we can do is retweet things that resonate with, absolutely. Talk about things that you, every time you retweet something 600,000 mines are potentially, yeah, potentially potentially. Fair enough. But 600,000 is a very big number. She, so even if only 10 if the tweet that you sent out triggers a butterfly effect in his thought, that opens up a whole new stream of possibilities for that person that will, that's real transformation. So it's natural selection playing out at a faster and faster rate because things are happening.

Speaker 3:          01:03:10       So you're creating artful change in the world using the power of your mind. Somebody listening to this might invent, might invent, you know, some new poem that becomes the campaign for some brand that, you know, transforming the world. Like I said, the butterfly effect, but we're talking to, it's on scales and numbers where that's possible. I've seen the engaged inspired audience, you know, interface with you. Like I've seen it. So it's like it's kind of what they're responding to you too man. They're responded to your ideas and you're passionate about it. And W you know, one of the cool things about having a podcast is someone right now could be anywhere, you know, doing some, some tedious work around the house or whatever. Right? And they were in a certain state of mind and the conversation that you brought up and the way we've explored these topics, all of a sudden their mind is fucking racing, you know?

Speaker 3:          01:03:55       And that is, that is a real cool thing. That is a really cool thing that we can do something like that. That that to me is one of the most satisfying aspects of this. That you can entertain someone and engage them and literally put them on a little bit of a mental journey where they start to hold Hodor looking about these different subjects. Yeah, absolutely. Nano technology and you start exploring it and seeing how bizarre it is. Some of the references that you use, you go and look them up and holy fuck. So many people ask for book recommendations after our session. So many, yeah, I've got to eventually like make like a thing on my website to my favorite books. Favorite documentary. So there's, there's documentary thread on the message board, but you know, I'm such a big fan of Joseph Campbell and the sort of mine as well, the hero's journey.

Speaker 3:          01:04:39       See, think of the hero's journey. We think so literally. So we're like obviously a geographical journey. Like if you go on a safari and then you climb Kilimanjaro, you will go through all the steps, a departure from the ordinary, overcoming obstacles, having a catharsis and realization and making the return. But we need to apply that metaphor internally. This podcast session is a Joseph Campbell Hero's journey person puts on the headphones and it's dosed the prints and who's the princess? No, no. We don't mean on a hero's journey. No, but think this is the hero's journey. It follows the steps. It's a departure from the ordinary. We're partaking in conversations that are maybe not your everyday conversations work, overcoming obstacles, the sense that we're challenging preconceived truths and questioning ourselves and asking difficult questions and thinking new thoughts. So that's what the obstacles and then we're transcending and overcoming the resistance that we have to change and to new ways of thinking.

Speaker 3:          01:05:29       And then we're having hopefully the catharsis, hopefully sometime during this journey, we have a moment of profound realization that changes us both and somebody listening to forever. And then we make the return, which is to say, I love that. I want to share that with my community. I'm going to tweet it, I'm going to Facebook it. So if you apply that metaphor of the hero's journey, you try to make parts of your life significant hero's journey. I'll wake up in the morning and we'd be like, today I'm going to depart from the ordinary. I'm gonna put myself in uncomfortable situations. I'm going to transcend those boundaries. I'm going to have a new realization. I want this day to mean something and then make the return.

Speaker 4:          01:05:56       Right? Come on. What if that day you got to like a bunch of shit you need to get done. You listen to this podcast. I don't want it to happen because it didn't happen in your brain to write. I'm going to read this book tonight, I'm going to, you know, check out this interesting documentary. It is definitely an hour a day. Is it expose yourself to different things. That's why I really get into finding big foot. I've been watching that a lot lately. Brian, probably it's one of the things I have and why it's just a waste of time for me. Fuck yeah, that's wasted time. But I'm trying to write to new material. My doing my special, by the way, it's confirmed, it's going to be happening Atlanta on April 20th at the Tabernacle Theater and um, most of the tickets are sold out for the first show, but we're going to do a second show. So we're, we'll have the, the first year, I think it's an eight, the second show be 10 30. And the second show tickets will go on sale sometime this week. Probably today's Monday sometime. Probably Wednesday I would guess. And, uh, uh, it'll be me and Joey Diaz and Duncan Trussell Hala, and I'll be recording my, uh, my news comedy special and releasing it. Lucy Kay style on the Internet for five. Brilliant Dude. Yeah, it's really good to call it. So you got to call it looky [inaudible] style. And you're going to be in New York too at some point, right? Yeah.

Speaker 4:          01:07:03       Yeah. What Day is that? A, I'm going to be there all of April, man. So cool. Yay. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          01:07:09       Actually I should tell you this, cause this is really cool. I mean, actually fifth, May 5th, May 4th. Okay. So let's link up. Okay. But actually next week, man, I'm heading up to, or this week at the end of this week, I'm heading up to the bay area because on the 20th, I'm speaking at Stanford Design School and showing some of my crazy ecstatic videos. Oh Wow. And then on the 27th of March, 27th, I'm speaking at Google,

Speaker 4:          01:07:32       I was invited. Oh yeah.

Speaker 3:          01:07:34       Show us some of the videos. And then on March 28th I'm going to be speaking at the economist Ideas Festival on innovation at Berkeley is going to be sick all, all about showing the videos. It's about talking about inspiration, creativity, new ways of packaging and disseminating ideas. Then I go to New York and on March 30th I'm speaking at the PSFK conference in Battery Park and then

Speaker 4:          01:07:53       said, I'm making people memorize this stuff cause most of them won't. What does your website, where's there? This all uh, oh yeah. Well in some of a.com if you go to this as Jason silva.com this is Jason Silva Daca. Yes. But the best thing honestly is Twitter, Twitter at Jason Underscore Silva, s Lva. And if you can't find it, it's on mine. Uh, talking about this podcast and that way I keep people updated in all the talks and April 20th,

Speaker 3:          01:08:15       the National Arts Club in New York City and he's speaking as well. This is amazing when this was all because of your videos and you punished for the Internet, which are really amazing. And if you Google Jason Silva, Vimeo, there's a whole page with a gang of amount of Vimeo is a nice high quality visual too. I love Vimeo, man. They're amazing. It's very high quality. Like when you can go full screen with it on a large screen, which is great. They get it. And the design it's made for like artists and this beautiful Vimeo is awesome. We put all of our podcasts up on Vimeo and we also put a, a, a video blog up and put that on video Vimeo as well. Um, but yeah, um, I think, uh, that's incredible man that you've given all this. It's worked just from those videos popping up on the Internet.

Speaker 3:          01:08:53       How did you get started in this man? What'd you, what is your background as far as like education and Shit, man? Well, I grew up in Venezuela and I went to, we talked to him about international school and of course factor of it as well. I was in film school and I did current TV, which was Al Gore's TV channel like the last five years. But it was really when I left last year that I wanted to do my own content. Do you ever get massages with al? No. We did go to a hotel. No, no. Really banking did now get some massage problems. I don't know. But um, yeah, the short videos were just, I wanted to like apply in principle what I was believing in intellectually, like I want it to, to make content that was mimetic because I believe we live in a world where a short form content disseminated through the Internet can effect, people, can transform minds.

Speaker 3:          01:09:32       We don't need the sort of the old gatekeepers, so to speak. Everybody's empowered. And so the reason short videos are easier to consume through small devices and this and that. And you don't ask people for too much of their time, you know, a c that's a big thing. Well, until you've won them over, like you and then people, I know that people love to listen to you for a long time, love the podcast because most people do is they listen to it while they're doing other stuff. So that's the best way to do it. That's brilliant. That's brilliant. It's a real genre. You know that it hasn't really been addressed before. You know, I love coming here with you because it gives me a chance to talk about these ideas in a space in which is it just bigger and people are listening to it, but you know from, for my situation to initially get to avoid the word out about the videos, it just worked to do with really short, but what I think people respond to them is whether or not they're into the ideas of exponential growth and technology and transforming the human condition.

Speaker 3:          01:10:19       People are into the idea that inspiration, it needs to be reinvented how we package and disseminate big ideas and needs to be reexamined because we have a new substrate. The Internet is a new substrate. When we invented the printing press, we came up with the format of the book and there was like rules and parameters and this is how it works. Best Television, we came up with the Sitcom film. We came up with the length of time that a film should be before people get restless into theater and so on and so forth. And I think on the Internet we're still figuring it out. What are the parameters of work, what are the lengths of videos that we're literally look at the statistics and get the information and find out how long people pay attention to stuff and this and that. And um, and so I'm just starting to raise ciders when I find long form documentaries available on like Google video and youtube. Sometimes we go to each of the people pay people don't do it yet on their screens. We're going to have that more and we have the merger of TV and with Web TV cause then you're on the TV, you're on the couch watching TV, watching web content and it's different experience. It's not just a small

Speaker 4:          01:11:14       screen right. When the screen's merge I think we'll have that. That's entirely going to happen. You don't think that it will be still have the separation of computer and television? I think software software's going to eat the world. That was a great article. So do you think that networks like NBC ab, that's like legacy, it's all gonna like be like VHS tapes someday I think we'll be going to be interfacing. I think the apple TV thing is coming is my feeling and that is going to make everything intuitive. And I read an article yesterday, uh, from um, Nick Bilton from the Times where he was saying that uh, he gets anxious when he looks at his cable and TV box because there's so many buttons that it's so complicated and he doesn't know what input is connected to what the best and most of the stuff, he doesn't want to watch it.

Speaker 4:          01:11:55       There's so many over and he says that he looks at it as like iPad and everything is so neat. Then he can press what he wants and get what he wants in real time. Moving in that direction. I mean, have you guys checked out Hbo go? It's really cool. Awesome. Yeah, I mean on your computer, watch anything anytime on demand. All eight years. Hbo Subscribers, premium. Beautiful. You know, I experienced that shit. That's another thing that's a future which is it's still clunky today and I can't believe it's so clunky. Like the other day I wanted it to find a show on a channel and I'm like, I don't know what the channel is. I have a thousand numbers. I'm like going through each channel, like where the fuck is this channel? You know? It should be a search. No, it's just going to be Siri. It's going to be, it's going to be turned to the cartoon network.

Speaker 4:          01:12:36       You know? It's, and that's all it's going to be. The remote control alone. It's just such, it's like looking at an old payphone. Yeah. When the UFC moved to a fuel TV, when they having some fights on fuel TV, how to find fuel TV forever. Fucking luck. Good luck. It's sucks. Yeah. It's like six 18 on direct TV. Especially when you have like HD channels now too. Half the time you're watching, you're not even watching the HD channel and you're like, oh shit, how long I've been watching this. There's so many channels now, man. It's amazing. It's really, that's why I think the apple TV, when it does get released, I think that's just going to change everything. I think everything's gonna be on the cart. I think, you know, yeah, NBC was going to be around, but they're going to be like any other channel.

Speaker 4:          01:13:15       It's gonna be like, you know your channel, you strike people like shows though. They're like, like lost the like things that are going to be produced by a production company that you might not be able to replicate. You know, the, the home user, you know, even with incredible software, people will always want the premium experience and they're willing to pay for the premium experience. I mean, I don't care to pay $20 to see an imax three d film in a theater and be completely immersive experience like that. So did you like Avatar? I thought it was beautiful. Did you feel any avatar depression when she left? You know, I think that's fascinating. Don't you think? Love it. That idea. Like there's a great book called the art of immersion by Frank Rose. It used to be at wired, who says that? The future of immersive storytelling in an example is Avatar is such an immersive three d experience and he says, we all long to go back to Pandora even though we've never really been there. We miss something that wasn't really real. But then again, everything

Speaker 3:          01:14:12       is not really real because it's all an illusion, but more and more dude, immersive experiences like that. Yes, we're going to, we're going to get sad when we fall out of the game or out of the movie or out of the virtual space cause it's increasingly becoming more interesting than reality.

Speaker 2:          01:14:26       Well, Gut Avatar, depression, really, they got depression that they weren't one of those blue things because you wouldn't want to have, you don't wouldn't want to be living in Avatar if you are a human, you just a little fucking bitch. I think it was so pretty. I got jacked left and right. Yeah, but humans like didn't even have a chance in the avatar world, but you can't have habit. Our depression, you essentially have depression about your species. You don't want to, you want to be one of the Navi.

Speaker 3:          01:14:48       Well, if you want to be larger than life, that can be what you want to live. That lifestyle that they're living in the love and honor. And I was little, I used to carry him fly Indiana Jones depression when Indiana Jones ended. I used to get sad. I want to dig for treasure in my backyard and I want it to have my life to be as fun as Indiana Jones. So I remember that feeling as a kid, you know, I really remember leaving films and, and wanting the, the luster in the law to sort of come home with me. But usually we, you know, you buy the [inaudible] Max and you watch it

Speaker 2:          01:15:18       Avatar though, that the culture of Avatar was missing. Everything that we're missing or rather than the culture of Avatar, the culture of the Navi had everything that we're missing that are lost society that are materialistic, ridiculous to, you know, society where we're not taking responsibility for our own actions. We all act collectively as a gigantic group or corporation that this tribal life, this tribal life that were all these people, like they're forced to told her own weight. And celebrated and loved each other. But that trial that, that

Speaker 3:          01:15:50       tribal life that supposedly was so advanced, I mean they still had hierarchical systems. There was still an angry boss that told everybody else would do still warriors. Like they hadn't really transcend our store, our savage in fact, but they're happier than secretaries. There's an interesting, uh, thing that Kurzweil had mentioned that he thought it was really interesting that you use the world's greatest technology to bring our imaginings into being, to make that movie, to then criticized technology in the movie. So you use the most powerful computers and digital tools to realize that dream into screen. And then you tell a story inside of that technologically mediated reality. You tell a story about how bad technology is and how we should all go live in a forest. Again, not really what they told the story about was about greed and about the willingness to fuck over cultures and kill a entities that also get lot of inner came out of that and said it was an indictment of technology. What was the mineral impossible Bahrainian or something like that. It was some stupid fucking name. I was like, what was it called Brian? And they saw the movie once obtained IOM in obtaining them like and hip possible to obtain something along those lines. Like, oh, you silly goose. There's a great term called comp with Terrainian that I recently learned. And I think it's when we've, uh, leverage all the matter in universe

Speaker 4:          01:17:10       or in the galaxy into computation. So all the atoms, we put computation into everything and then becomes a computronium. Well, I'm not, I'm not sure if I'm explaining it correctly, but yeah. This idea that a civilization will eventually get advanced, that it can leverage all the matter in the universe and put computation into it, harness all that matter and energy in the universe. What does that even mean? Could you use that word computation? Well, you know how there's, you know, our computers are bunch of materials and we put computation into those computation, into the stars. Yeah, that's, yeah. How the fuck would you do that? I'm not a physicist, but this is stuff that you can find physical articles that you know, speculate about the future and how society will cross a scale and then it will harness the energy of its star and put computation into matter and terraform other worlds.

Speaker 4:          01:17:56       And yeah, I mean it's, it's, I mean we're over. I mean, we already do it inside of computers. I mean computation and complexity inside of a microchip. The only other thing is complex is the brain. You know, what have nothing else in the universe has that complexity I find fascinating. When I go back to like some 1980s in 1990 science fiction movies, I like watching like what they thought a computer was going to be like, like the movie alien. I watched that again the other day, one of my all time favorite movies and amazing movie and still holds up as far as like, let's be excited about prometheus's. Oh fuck it. Oh Man. It's on the three d trailer and a theater. Anything Ridley Scott comes up with, I'm down for the first alien movies. One of my all time favorite movies. But God, the computer looks so fucking wanky and shit and it was fascinating that like, you know, when you look at like some of these uh, older movies, they'll be like, they'll take place in 2017 and it's like nothing looks anything like today.

Speaker 4:          01:18:51       Everything super futuristic, flying cars and shit. Like when was blade runner is supposed to be taking place in? How far in the future was it? That's a good question. I don't think it was that far. I don't do it to you. She anything close to what you would see. Some of the little flying robots that they showed at Ted this year, I saw some of the choreograph, choreograph flying little helicopters that could do a dance and go around obstacles and objects and there's going to be, have HD cameras and they can map rooms. The Google self driving cars, 200,000 miles. They've driven with zero accidents. 1 million people a year die in road accidents. Okay. 1 million people a year. When we switch over to those self driving cars, which we already know after 200,000 miles, no accidents, they're only going to get better. That's, I mean that's what cars are going to be.

Speaker 4:          01:19:36       Of course self driving cars, airplanes, man. But then you went there too. Unreliable. He never be able to go sideways or on a corner. You can do it in a sport track. You'd have to go to the track. Yeah, it'll be a sport, but not in a place where you can hit a pedestrian or hurt somebody else. You know? Of course that will be, but that's, yeah, that's coming man. It's amazing. It goes Google guys. God their genius. Yeah, there there are. So no one saw them coming. I mean if there was a sky net and skynet wanting to sneak up on society and just sort of integrated self completely. I mean it is Google is there like a website is skynet.com or something like that. Yeah, but I think at this point their ambition of don't be evil is so true. I mean, I think that, I love Google, don't get me wrong, but I'm saying it's amazing what Google maps.

Speaker 4:          01:20:18       Google fucking voicemail and Google g-mail all freeze this Christ all free. Yeah, it's credible to crap. There's a whole book about how everything is d materializing and it's becoming for free. We used to have a camera but now camera doesn't exist because it's inside your phone. You used to have like a notebook to write things down that that disappeared cause now it's all on your phone, which by the way is dematerializing and going into your device. Have you seen this new device that's just come on as a new droid that came out? This the Samsung Journal. Oh, have you seen this thing Penn one to know dude, it's fucking five inches. It's huge. It's the biggest one ever. It's like a cross between a tablet and an iPhone. It's amazing. Beautiful. But the battery lasts about 35 seconds. Totally not full brightness. You've got about a half a half a minute.

Speaker 4:          01:21:05       That's pretty crazy. It's pretty crazy that that new iPad three a has the same battery life, but yet the screens HD and that's exponential growth right there. Those battery life, the battery life on those iPads was amazing. Their first batch already. Dude, is it, the demand is unprecedented, dude. It's pretty shocking how long you can watch a movie on those things. Watch a three, four movies and you look at it. It's not even like halfway choose to with a battery and I can't wait for the eye mind. You think they're already working on the I mine does that. It'll be like a synthetic mind, you know directly I can trust. I can't wait for the high car. They need to make cars. I need to make a car. They'll do their counterparts of Google's self driving android cars and then apple needs. It's aicar cheeses.

Speaker 4:          01:21:45       How long before? We see self driving cars on the street very soon. Very soon. Because Google already has them driving in California and there's been over 200,000 miles. Yeah. The driving in California right now, like, oh yeah, you can, you could be rear ended by a fucking zero accidents and 200,000 miles on it. I'll be the first one. The Sun, they map, they map three dimensional maps of what's in front of them. Dude, it's insane. They can see like they can see and they can notice people walking. They'll adjust accordingly. It's in, you know, it freaks me out. Meet the scene. We got onto this through the idea of robotics and flying drones freaks me out as those, uh, those things that walk, that have like 10, 15 legs and you kick kick 'em and they adjust. It looks like a dog with that thing.

Speaker 4:          01:22:29       Man, that's incredible. You should have seen the Ted talk, the head of Darpa gave a Ted talk to and she was the most poised, elegant, articulate, attractive woman dues and that the people from last Darpa is the defense. Advanced Research Dharma. I know. Dark. She was amazing. She was talking about dreaming the impossible. She actually reminded me of Jodie Foster's character in contact. Is this really elegant, poised our ticket? You actually felt comforted to know that somebody, that intelligence seeming is like running Darpa and her ted talk was Ugh, belligerent talking about, she was talking about dreaming the impossible and we have to challenge what we, what is in order to dream about what could be and you know, and she's speaking on behalf of the agency who has a lot of stuff. So it's kind of a main thing. I don't know. But a lot of stuff that we take these short today cutting edge stuff.

Speaker 4:          01:23:11       Are you sure? I'm pretty sure if you don't know, how can you be sure? Well, cause if you read about dark all the time and they do the advanced secret research project, wow. I wonder what they're working on. She showed a hypersonic planes. We still haven't got to aliens. Uh, we didn't get to alien. No, we went to you went out and took me out. I told you about trends. Sension why we don't buy, we could never see them. FERMI's paradox. So you don't think we'll ever see him? Only when we build our own black hole and go into it, then we'll meet them at the end of time. Whoa. Cause it's sling shots you at. So it's not terrible that they could just be like roaming through this universe in galactic that if they did that, that would influence our evolution. US discovering them and being influenced by their technology would be influencing our ultimate evolution [inaudible] battery.

Speaker 4:          01:23:52       It will get a butterfly effect. And the, the thing that John's smart says is they wouldn't want to do that because that would be akin to incest to influencing us in some way. And then changing the, how we unfold devil's advocate, this is through our understanding of genetics, right? It's not through theirs. And if there are a thousand or a million years more advanced than us, maybe they know a lot more about how to work that shit. Right. And maybe that's why he says it's a, maybe it's not that they would think of it as incest at all, but they've completely gone past the idea of gender and replication by means of sexuality is just what we had replication from the primate form. But they wouldn't want it to replicate their technology. Alien, large almond shaped I form. Right. They wouldn't want us to replicate their technology says who I mean.

Speaker 4:          01:24:33       Well maybe, maybe there's a some sort of thing that will lead to the most amount of diversity and if we're not influenced by them they'll be more diversity because we'll get there ourselves. It's just beginning to get the end of the day. Anyway, that's what he says. I got a deal that people really love to share when it comes to a wacky alien theories is that aliens have genetically engineered human beings in the first place of that. I mean, I mean you can't unproved that. So the next five years that's a problem, right? You can't improve leprechaun throw. You know why that's, that's the thing. That's the dog thing. We're watching those, the, the, the nuttiest thing about this, this weird looking robot things and it moves. It has like sort of like, oh, like an insect like leg set up, kick it, it adjusts and it doesn't fall down.

Speaker 4:          01:25:15       Yeah. Look at adjusting to the sand and the toad and walking on a beach. And if that thing starts saying hi to you and smiling and drooling and it was totally fall in love, know what I'm seeing to put that thing on one more second. You know what I'm saying? I'm seeing that thing storm out of the back of a giant battleship and missiles flying off of it. That's what I think. I think if they make one of those fucking things, they make it to send over to countries. Could you imagine a whole army of these motherfuckers heading into your town shooting missiles? I, you tell me. I'm imagining them as pets for rocket launchers on that bitch. It's always a double edged sword. I have to admit, it's always a double edged sword. But look, what do people start riding and they become the, they will become the new horses. There'll be our little pets. Look, it's wagging its tail. It's wagon to say, oh gosh, you feel bad for it when he kicks it. You feel bad. So humans, yeah, but think of how quickly you feel bad

Speaker 1:          01:26:04       for it. I do. But what's amazing is this thing adjusted and it seems to be adjusting the, the, the movements seem organic. Yeah, totally. Totally. Biomimic we're going to have one of those and we're going to ride them like, yeah, like a, like a goat down the side of a mountain. That's what he's going to be like. You know those, those crazy goats that can they, they're, they're incredibly strong and they climb up the side of mountains. They never, she never, she plane. Yeah. They never get tired. They don't have ache. Yeah. But then they would probably run on solar power to eventually it's solar power is going to get to a point where it can power everything. Right. Of course. Then when we get 10,000 times more energy from the sun than we need this fucking thing. Slow Shit doing a better way, better ways of capturing that energy.

Speaker 1:          01:26:45       I'd be pissed if I was writing this stupid thing right now. I'd be like, come on bitch. Free Energy. That gives us free energy to heavy Brian for that, for that. You know how it's going and say, oh wow. It's making it through. So fascinating. That's incredible. It's walking down to the snow and there's a bunch of different designs of them too. I've seen other ones that have like many more legs. Wow, that's crazy. Look at this things. Dancing, robotics, robotics is going to be such a huge, well, robotics and AI, artificial intelligence, robot rice. Look at that. That down to the bare skeleton of a thing. This is incredible stuff folks. I know we're just talking right now. Unfortunately for a lot of you folks that are listening to this on Itunes, just go, which should they Google Brian so they could watch this. This is Boston dynamics, but just say new big dog robot, new big dog robot video, and it looks like a spider when you're looking.

Speaker 1:          01:27:34       Really, it's a must and it's the one that has 700 plus thousand hits on it. It's, it's a must. See you. You need to know. Amazing. Yeah, it's, I mean, what, what does the future hold that we're not prepared for? What is the next step? You know, I mean, the Internet I think caught most people by surprise. Well, there were in her a robot dog. Oh my God, Brian just put on a robot dog and this thing is moving around like an animated dog. This is insane. The thing is, there was, there was a guy at Ted that showed his, uh, oh my God, that's the same. That dog's insane now where there's been this guy ted, no, no, no. There's going to be, there's going to be more of those kinds of robots and the more that they, uh, interface with us and they look cute, we'll be, we'll start.

Speaker 1:          01:28:15       It doesn't matter if they're conscious or not as once they cross a certain kind of perceptual barrier that we have and they're like, they seem real. We'll start to interface with them as they're going to be hard. Just like your dog, you know, when you come home and have a car, I come home and have a conversation with your dog. It doesn't matter if you understand the way the feedback, and we'll have the same thing with robots do it as long as we can get past the idea that something that's a metal and wires and you know that that thing can't have some sort of a soul because you're interacting with it. You know if you're interacting with it as long as plenty soul in it, what is your fucking computer gets needy like, well maybe you might want it to get needy because it'll make you feel like you're, you're important to site.

Speaker 1:          01:28:54       Maybe that's a part of like what it's like to have vagal butt fucked. All that erode fucked all the really good ones. So like the look, they're really dangerous. Like this pitch might burn your house down. Like you can't fuck other girls. Like she's really, she's going to be the best, hottest robot fucked off ever. The robots will whatever you want and that's the only way to make it hot. The only way that they get hot, she has to be super jealous. She can't just let you just treat her like shit. I mean, why aren't you sharing your location services? She becomes, she becomes a robot, an angry psycho jealous robot, and that's the hottest sex you can get. And so that's why everybody just accepts it. You'll be able to do whatever you want the robots, robots are going to be, there'll be Asian Robo fucker.

Speaker 1:          01:29:34       I was telling us no questions, just take care of business son. Right? They'll always be the exotic Asian robot. Fucked dolls. Yeah. W you know there's interesting, we talking about all these exotic, all these exotic technology and it's sounding like we're talking about Asians were not. So it sounds a hallucinatory, even though it's very quickly emerge and it just takes you back to that whole thing about computers as the modern version of the psychedelic. Just want to say if you're an Asian girl, I'm just joking around. These are just jokes or just throw things out there. I don't mean anything by him. Okay. But what do you think of that? Like to told Timothy Leary, computers are the LSD of the nineties and people took drugs and they're like, we can expand our minds and now computers expand our minds. Well relationship is very fascinating to me.

Speaker 1:          01:30:22       It's absolutely fascinating. Well right now, just think this, what's this interface it's happening right now. This is all live, right. You know, and right now there's, there's only 2000 people aren't sinked up live with us. But eventually this, this feeling of this conversation and these, these ideas explored. I'm going to branch out to about a half a million Pete, but right. Throw half a million in mind. Our thoughts. Yeah. And out of that half a million, who knows how many people are gonna just, you know, I read this Tony Robbins thing once where he talked about Tony Robbins actually very positive. You know, a lot of people think that Tony Robbins is full of shit cause he's kind of like made a loud noise. I think he's brilliant. He's, he's up. We've got a lot of very, very good points. And one of them was to change your life to make huge changes. All you need is a small change in the direction and over time that small change will lead you so far apart of where your initial direction was.

Speaker 1:          01:31:12       Absolutely true. The idea is that if you have two cars in two parallel lines and one of them just takes a slight turn to the right and they keep driving straight, the one who slight turned the right, it's going to be, you know, a hundred miles from now, it's going to be way the fuck away from that other one total. And that's sometimes really how you have to look at it. We especially, I mean I'm a super impatient person. I want things now too. Even when I go to the supermarket, I'm like, you bitches don't have any grass fed beef seriously. Right. But I mean like what I proposed to his headset that I think that I can just go to a place and they've killed an animal for me, raised it on grass, only killed animals and there's plenty of meat. I can feed my family. I can stay alive from this dog, this food here. And this is what I'm planning because they didn't get the shipment of organic meat that day. Well, think about it. I have no grass fed beef to fuck. But what about when you're having a Skype

Speaker 4:          01:32:00       conversation with somebody on the other side of the planet and you're just like taken for granted that you can see their face and they could see yours. You know, you're talking in real time for free and then like all of a sudden it might freeze. You're like, Oh God damn man, it's freezing. Why is this freaking computer freezing? Why is but like think about what you were just enjoying two seconds before you totally take it for granted. Now we assimilate man. He dynamic adaptation. Yeah. That is what it is. It is an adaptation. You know, it's, it's uh, it's amazing though that we have this urge in this push to make things bigger, faster, quicker, and that that urgent push is also responsible for one of the reasons why people get accustomed to things and want more. And you used a quote you quoted Mckenna, and you talked about how something about the astonishment and not give it to the astonishment, astonished that give into it, but definitely seek it out because I think most people, well, he's talking about DMT though.

Speaker 4:          01:32:51       Yeah. Dm The beat the truth and DMT. DMT have not, but don't you think that, for example, it's astonishing that you can do this podcast and reach half a million minds and very rarely does one marvel at the astonishment of the things that are every day that are Morag, how many hundreds of thousands of Aircrafts are flying through the air right now communicating with one another, flying safely, individuals in other to other parts of the world. We don't experience that astonishment. I don't wake up in astonishment. We should. Yeah, you're absolutely right. I mean, if you had pulled someone out of the cave man error and put him in modern society, it would be just a psychedelic as a lot of pot trips. Yes. Yeah, yeah, exactly. It'd be so bizarre. And outside of the, the wha what you conceived of just seconds ago as being possible. Right. You know, you take someone from, you know, a thousand years ago, 500 years ago, a blip in time means nothing to the universe and then put them in today or put them in a garden movie theater making watch Harry Potter and Shit.

Speaker 4:          01:33:46       His pants shit is bad. You imagine what a garden out of a fucking dragon when I was Harry Potter Dragon will own fire out flying to the fight. He would just dive on the ground screaming in the car. Right? That is so amazing. The fact that that it, that is that we wake up in the morning, we don't think about that because that just is, we're onto the next thing and onto the next thing to be looking forward to or to be complaining about. And maybe that's the part of our evolutionary makeup that makes us always probe the boundaries of the adjacent possible and always want to keep pushing because maybe if we were in astonishment of all we've done, we wouldn't keep progressing. We're obsessed with innovation. Human beings are obsessed with innovation. You mean, you know, every year sports cars get faster. We're getting to a point right now where like regular cars are doing like race track numbers. Even though we have speed limits, even though we have that, like we still push the performance limits. I'm fascinated by by sports cars cause just cause I'm, I'm fascinated by extreme engineering. Yeah. It's fascinating by the idea that there's a bunch of people out there that are trying to get something to the handles faster. I was better geometry moves better sticks. And the newest nine Porsche nine 11 goes around

Speaker 1:          01:34:58       the track as fast as the nine nine six cup car. So the, the Newburg ring, which is like this really twisty turny track in Germany, a really high end sports car can go around it today at about seven minutes, 30 seconds, seven minutes, 40 seconds. That's like a nine 11 a real high end car. That's with race cars would do just a decade earlier. So it's getting to this crazy point where regular modern street cars aren't like, like fucking cup cars. So how much faster do you need these fucking things? Like you know Dubai, but you got Ebay, Ron, they have a Bugatti Veyron. It's like a thousand fucking horsepower. We do it just to do it, man. Just that's crazy is to see how much complexity we can pack into it. How much performance you can get out of it. It's like modern jet engines do operate at half the temperature of the surface of the sun because he's more of a modern jet engine. Just if you, I mean it's, it's insane. Okayed spins at 500 miles. But I mean, I don't remember the speed but a jet engines or if really feats of engineering. I mean it's, I mean, you know, we, everyone's scared of flying. Jesus Christ is 30,000 flights a day and nothing happens. It's incredible. So safe. It's amazing. Yeah. But the way you'd go is so terrifying. Just slamming into the fucking rain forest.

Speaker 4:          01:36:19       That's why I love Virgin America so much, dude. Cause they got brand new planes. They really rock, brand new state of the art fleet. Well because most other airlines in this country, countries have fleets. They're 20 to 25 to 30 years old. Scared the fuck out of me right now. I need to go. No, no, no. Listen, that doesn't make them any less safe. These planes are still certified and well maintained. Nonetheless. Nonetheless, on Virgin America, you're getting a brand new fleet of shiny gated yard with the best of everything. With Internet. No, you're not getting a brand new pilot, let's say, dude, we're ready. You know, it's just, but it's nice [inaudible] it's the years 2012 you want to fly on an airplane that was manufactured, you know, in the last year or two or three. It's just makes you feel better when they're shiny. There's less stress fractures.

Speaker 4:          01:37:02       It's, yeah, it is kind of an interesting thing about air technology is that we essentially have the same tech. It's really one of the only industries that has the same technology, you know, general principles. But the engines are far more reliable and far more advanced than they were before. What, what? When did they start getting much better? Oh, well, yeah. At the same Moore's law that applies in computers. I mean the engineering of a modern jet engine and the computers are jets from like the 1970s and 1980s. Well, no, they make, they make revisions that are pretty much like an entire new model. I find wine still worry engines. They change everything. Yeah. I phoned one. It'll work as long as you don't have to take the software. Right, right. But, uh, it's kind of fun to go on the new ones. They have far more technology.

Speaker 4:          01:37:40       That robot dog, you know what that's going to be in the future. Check the screen out right here. How crazy is this? Somebody posted this on your message board, but uh, hold on. Episode two, attack of the clones. Uh, here we go. [inaudible] my God, that's the robot augmented placed in there or well, yeah, yeah. But imagine there at ads, you know, from Star Wars, those robot dogs are the exact same thing as an ad. Oh Dude, you're totally right. I mean, it looks exactly the same. Oh, so what is that? That's just the added that, yeah. Somebody just put a funny video together. Well that's, that's amazing. You're totally right. Yeah. That's exactly what it is. Yeah. It's fast. Brian. Stupid fucking cat clock. How dare you. Oh, is that the cat clock? Yeah, that's the, uh, the famous cat clock. He likes, he likes things to meow.

Speaker 4:          01:38:28       Um, you know, future of medicine, man. Are you excited about that? Yeah. Well, I'm excited about the idea of keeping people alive long enough to figure out some really crazy shit. Oh yeah. The idea of people staying long enough to overpopulate the planet kind of freaks me out though. It was the most people cluster around only like 3% of the surface of the world, which is the city states. Cities. Yeah. Know the world is still mostly, and it's mostly water and technology is more like a resource liberating mechanism because scarcity is just contextual. Things are only scarce until you create technology that makes them into things that are abundant. People talk about water wars, but the mini not worried at all about overpopulation. Oh Man, no, not at all. In fact, the more developed and educated people become and in developed nations that the rate of having children goes down significantly.

Speaker 4:          01:39:15       Mckenna has the best cure against overpopulation is to educate our people and put more in technology into their hands, but also, um, also like desalinization for example, you know, once we perfect that technology, this, this is called a blue planet. It's a water planet. It's mostly water. It just needs to be converted. But they have anything right now that can their deals. Israel has a lot of these ellipses desalinization plants. Oh yeah. Just got to get more advanced. Just like solar panels. It's just exponential growth. Once they hit the tipping point where it's actually cheaper to use those technologies and to do it the other way, then it becomes, it'll become the main thing. Wow.

Speaker 4:          01:39:50       Great. You need to create, incentivize to incentivize people to innovate and we're such constant will probably dry out the fucking ocean. We'll probably pull all the water out of the ocean. No, I don't think we were plenty of water. Imagine though, if we're so greedy, we use up all the water and the ocean. I mean, nobody predicted that we would have polluted the ocean the way we have and just a hundred years. I mean we've done an incredible job with fucking old nano technology will create synthetic biology that eats the plastic and we'll, yes. Where's the evidence of that ever having taken place in the past? When have we ever fixed anything? There is a, there's an x prize contest that the x prize is doing to come up to something with plastics. The technology there to clean up oil spills or something like that. Yeah, like you criteria that eats plastic like that you want it is you create incentive by offering these prizes, like $10 million prizes and teams around the world.

Speaker 4:          01:40:37       We'll spend $100 million to win a $10 million prize because of the prestige and because the legacy or swamp thing came from for what swamp thing? Remember the marvel comics swamp thing from a contest? No, no. From some porn, some biological shit to eat up some. Maybe I'm in fact, I don't know, maybe it's another example of that and the x prize. They were the ones that did the $10 million enterprise for space, which became virgin galactic. Well, they have one now to create a device. That's the size of like an iPhone called the tri quarter. $10 million to do can make a device that you can spit on or you can put your blood on and that will diagnose you with the equivalent of a 10 certified doctors with greater accuracy than 10 certified doctors. I swear to God, this is their new condos. This is her net, $2 million per $10 million prize that they just put out.

Speaker 4:          01:41:21       It's right tricorder x prize. Is it possible divorce is going to be possible? I mean they're already have things that you can put on your iPhone that you can spit on that we'll like Beshar your measure and analyze your watts fluid. Yeah, really? Yeah. They already have this bid on your iPhone shots to it yet. What's it called? I have no idea, but people can Google spitting on your iPhone medical device. Wow. I'd never heard of that. That's amazing. That stuff is going to get a lot faster because now that that biology is becoming information technologies and information technology, we're going to see the same progress. Well, it's so cool when you have contests for good along those lines, like with x prize and the fact that they would come up with something along that. Yeah, they're brilliant. Yeah. And I mean, I would love to believe you, I believe to believe that someone is going to eventually figure out a way to get rid of that giant patch of garbage that's in the Pacific Ocean.

Speaker 4:          01:42:05       We shall, we shall. That's a big issue, huh? Yeah. Well people talk about that a lot. They're very concerned. Although it's nice. It's not actually like the size of a country as people had. I think it's the size of Texas. I don't, I'm not, I don't think it actually is physical size of Texas. Well, I think that they're so small. No, I think the, you know how it is, it's all caught in the current, there's like a vortex, a vortex. Really. That's where all the garbage piles up and then all the garbage. Let's, I'll look at it right now. Okay. Let me Google this real quick. Powerful Google, uh, Pacific Ocean garbage patch. Pacific Ocean.

Speaker 6:          01:42:44       Okay.

Speaker 4:          01:42:48       Oh, it's fucking huge. Holy Shit.

Speaker 6:          01:42:56       Wow.

Speaker 4:          01:42:59       Although many immediate and advocate advocacy reports have suggested that the patch extends over an area larger than the continental us. Recent research sponsored by the National Science Foundation suggest that the affected area may be twice the size of Hawaii. Wow. Wow. That's fucking big. But that's a lot of tracks. I, I'm pretty confident that we will create nano technology that will literally eat up the garbage. That's how we'll, that's how we'll fix it. But then when the, when it runs out of garbage, 10 it'd be hungry and then it becomes swamp thing. Maybe you don't, it doesn't want to die, man. It doesn't want to die. And that's how you know, like the premise to a lot of comic book monsters, it's a double edge sword fight get is we better come up with a way to kill those things before we feed them plastic. Well, yes. Look, it's important to look at all the possible uses of technology for good and for bad.

Speaker 4:          01:43:51       Why the conversation needs to be had though, because the progress is not stopping. When I think if we paint beautiful pictures of how things could be, we inspire the people to make sure that that's what we actually, absolutely. I completely agree with you and I think you know the way you're doing it in videos and online, it was really cool and it's very close buddy. Well, the way you're doing it, it is amazing. But my question to you is, what if we saw kangaroos evolving? What if we saw Kangaroos? They had found some flour. There was a psychedelic flower. They started eating it and Kangaroos started building houses, willing weapons and shit like that. And some we saw some kangaroos welding, we saw some welding. We would. We allow that shit. I think we go in and kick the Kangaroos assets and you'll get the fuck outta here.

Speaker 4:          01:44:29       Wear your armor. We might, we might make other animals smarter. Who knows? Do you think so we might give them stem. We'd be battling for resources. I think we would just check on. No, cause I ran out nuclear power. What if Kangaroos came up with a new x before I ran? Would have kangaroos just started fucking being really super smart man. Yeah. Well, but I don't think that the resources will be an issue because we'll be harnessing energy from the whole galaxy. There is an infinity of reasons you say that, but what if an asteroid lands in Australia right near where the Kangaroos are and some spores from this asteroid contain a never before seen mushroom rapidly accelerates evolution and within like a hundred years they surpass us and then what? Kangaroos are smart enough. What do you do then Brian? What if, what if? What are you going to do?

Speaker 4:          01:45:16       You Go, you're fucking cat clock. I'll create a time machine and take the words. What if out of the dictionary? Well then I'm going to take a time when she didn't take the word like out and you won't ever be able to say anything. What have I have a bitch? Listen, I believe that you are absolutely convinced that someone's going to come out with us. I just don't know. I see it. I see it happening, man, and I know this. Our brains. What is the current plans to fix this now? To fix with garbage patch. So we were talking about, yeah, well they're talking about creating some kind of like algae or bacteria that eats the plastic. I think one of the big guys have a synthetic biology is Craig venter who also spoke at the singularity university thing and he was seeing in terms of the future fuels and the future of like cleaning up like chemicals and absolutely going to be using synthetic biology.

Speaker 4:          01:46:05       Wow. Yeah. Cause we can program life to do whatever we want. You know, so we can, it's just like we can use language to describe anything. We can just author instructions, you know? And here you have software that writes its own hardware. See that's the thing about programmable life. Unlike computers, you write the code, the code manufacturer's its own like phenotype, right? Cause life, the genes determine its physical attributes. So the software writes its own hardware into existence. That's what's really exciting about like synthetic biology and programmable life. Especially if he gives synthetic. Like if you give some artificial intelligence access to three d computers and three d printers, dude, absolutely God, you're going to imagine Raisie unlimited intelligence and eliminate intelligence. It replicates itself and three d printers, but just the concept of three d printers, having it aware of, oh, now I can improve upon this design of three d printers with trillions of time, more ram than our brains, and instantaneously, well, you know what, Henry Miller's like 10,000 years of progress and we need to believe that it's coming.

Speaker 4:          01:47:06       Then Henry Miller said, the day that men ceased to believe that they will one day become gods, then they will surely become worms. Wow. That was Henry Miller. So he says, believe mankind, you know, for going from ape to superman, you know, smack in the middle in a trajectory between the born and the made. Right. That's where we are, man. Yeah, we were, yeah. We're in this word is in the middle. Yeah. When there's this weird stage where we're sort of conscious and we're, we're aware, animalistic and cellist, weird and savage, Horny, we're going to turn ourselves into the most beautiful artwork we've ever made. Men, you really think so? I definitely the aliens land first or the aliens I had first. So you don't believe that society's ever gets to the point where they travel from one place to another land and affect things that doesn't? No, I think that they do.

Speaker 4:          01:47:54       But the transection hypothesis says that by the time maybe they reached the edge of the solar system where the edge of the galaxy at that point, all the density goes back and it goes into words, into the Nano scale. So it's Kinda like we, the complexity goes into itself and goes and makes it a black hole and disappears from the visible universe. Is it possible that we should look at the trend section hypothesis because, cause it'll probably explain much better than I can, but isn't it possible that what you're dealing with is something that's here all the time, but it's in another dimension? Is it possible for dimension string theory? Yeah. I mean that is addressed in that article. Yeah. Yeah. So you could even go back to Mckenna and say, oh, so when Mckenna talks about hyper dimensional beings and then uh, well the transection hypothesis says essentially our minds, yes.

Speaker 4:          01:48:33       Will break through the visible universe into other dimensions. It's like crazy stuff except it's like written by an academic scholar. Wow. Yeah. So no aliens and flying saucers. Just landing. Yeah, that's, that's what he says. He says, well yeah, we'll go to other planets. But that's like early stage stuff like going to other planets over the next like 50 years earlier to get invaded were essentially invaded by young punks that the, the really high level aliens wouldn't bother. It fails. Right. Totally. You know, every time we do that, the microphone picks it up. Sorry man. It's fine. It's good. But you know, someone's going to be upset. I just, I'm sensitive because people always complain. I used to chew gum. You can't shoot Mike Anymore. People are like, dude, you're fucking sipping. Can't sip drinks. If you get up here and people get mad. I guess if you got to think of as somebody that's the reason why we put headphones on and liquid easily to his conversation. But if you were in the gym right now, you would hear that. I'm sorry Jim, go please. Sorry. Sorry everybody. Just wanting to keep everybody happy. Um, I mean this is all incredible stuff and I, I guess it all could come true and, and come to fruition as long as we don't fuck it up or as long as some gigantic natural disaster doesn't happen as well. Right? Yes. You take any, do you ever take any care

Speaker 1:          01:49:48       and consideration? Well, yeah, I mean that's super volcanoes, shit like that. I think, look, we have to be paying attention and we have to be cautious and we have to be vigilant as we transitioned towards what promises to be the most exciting time in human history. I mean, we're already living in the most exciting time in human history, but let's not lose focus, you know, like let's address the grand challenges of humanity. We've never had such tools with which to do so. And I think it's like an opportunity for us to pull our mental cognitive surpluses together and fix shit. Yeah, absolutely. Do you think we'll ever get to the point where we can avoid asteroids? Sure. You think so? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. We'll get shoot them down. You think shinning down with lasers, single laser will blow it up. It's going to, everything is turning into star wars.

Speaker 1:          01:50:34       Yeah. You really think the animal will do that. Don't mean some asteroids are miles wide. We get, we already have lasers that are pretty powerful. I mean send nuclear weapons to them like in the movie sunshine. Well, the issue with that is actually that that makes it worse because what happens is instead of one big impact who have hundreds of thousands of a little ones, well they're not even little. You know, you don't need anything that big tech giant crater in Nevada. You know, it's one of the weird things about all planets. Me, every plan will be find is littered with impacts. You know, we're, we live in a very volatile source system where we've been inhabiting a goldilocks space for the Goldie locks. At a time and we've just been very, very lucky. Like I said, all we were talking about this, all of our progress man is a blink of a blink of a blink, of a blink of a blink in terms of cosmic time.

Speaker 1:          01:51:15       So it's like, it's not that we, I mean we're lucky. Yeah. But it hasn't been that much time that has passed, you know, give it a couple of million years and the inevitability of getting hit, it's coming. But that's why we got to progress so that we can thwart that. Well, they just found a very recent evidence of an impact, a big one about 13,000 years ago. And what's really fascinating about that is all the, uh, ancient history theorists all point to that point in time is one being the end of the ice age, like around that time, the end of the pleistocene. And also also that's when a lot of people point to the possibility of like an ancient civilization like Egypt falling apart and then rebuilding in the same area. Sure, sure, sure, sure. Yeah. When they, when they hypothesize that something went wrong, it's always around 10,000, 12,000, 13,000, somewhere around there.

Speaker 1:          01:51:58       I like, you know, the cycles. Yeah. Well the idea is that, you know, human life on this planet, like the reason why there's the myth of Atlantis and the myth of, uh, you know, uh, Noah in the Ark and the epic of Gilgamesh is that there's all these giant disasters just that frequently hit, you know, and you know, if something hit us today and wiped out, we're wired to look for danger, man. Sure. The only way we survive. So cautionary tales embedded in our culture are just alarm system. Sure. And it's kind of in a race. I mean, it's kind of a race between technology awareness, progress and the ability to at least predict and prepare a slightly for natural disasters. But some of them like Caldera, volcanoes and things along those lines, this is not need to do, man. It was just nothing you could do. When goes it goes.

Speaker 4:          01:52:46       Unless you can figure out a way to throw some ice cubes on the, on the lava and maybe keep it from fucking blowing sky high, no technologies. The only way I think that could be addressed, you know, that's, that's, that's, that really is the craziest technology. I mean self replicating things in an ANA scale. It's like be mad that you'd be able to throw those into the lava and they would somehow or another crowd bill everybody the fuck out. Yeah. Change the structure of the molecular structure of the lava. I don't know if that fuck it freezes up the planet and turns us into another ice age. Jesus Christ. Jason, Jason Silva. What are you doing? The Butterfly effect issue is always, yeah, it is. We don't care. Well, no, it will have super computers that can map out every possible possibility. Trillions of times more than we can map out different scenarios in our heads so those ais will be able to pick the best scenario.

Speaker 4:          01:53:31       They'll make mathematical projection. There'll be like, okay, there's a billion in one probabilities of, and Annette, this is the best one. Let's do it. You spend so much time thinking about the future and thinking about all these possibilities. Is it, is it possible that when you do this, or is it a difficult, when you do this not to, not to ignore the present? Is it hard to, you know, is it like, is it like a sort of a normal thing to sort of ignore the present while you're concentrating it entirely on what the human race is going to accomplish it? Well, well I think that, you know how they say that was phrase that very well, but you know, no, no, I think you know how they did, we always talk about how human beings need a purpose. Purpose by its very nature implies a reason to look forward, right?

Speaker 4:          01:54:10       So we can't help but look to the future. It's what we do. So your purpose is to create a purpose in, to put the idea of purpose into people's, gives me a sense of purpose is a collective feeling that like, wow, humanity has this unique opportunity to sort of map it's road beautifully. And we all have a way of participating in that. And what a wonderful sense of collective purpose. It's just, it's more interesting to me than like, oh, well my purpose is to become, you know, or get this job or do this thing. It's like, yeah, I want to get this job into this things just like everybody else because I want to survive, but I'm in the mood for cosmic purpose. Cosmic significance. Your cosmic dig slinger, did I say they say it's the same reason that religion always appealed to people for the same reason that man can live for a few, you know, few weeks without food, a few days without water, but not for a second without hope.

Speaker 4:          01:54:59       It's just the human condition. You know, the minute we lose hope, we commit suicide. Not The minute. Sometimes you can really suffer for years before you pull the plug, but when you lose complete hope, you won't even wait around if you're waiting around it because you have a little bit of thing of thinking that it thinks might turn around. Yeah, I think it's important. I think it's important to to look forward. I think it's, it's huge. I think it's the only thing that propels our progress anyway because if we were in a stupefied Lowell staying in the present, we wouldn't do anything.

Speaker 4:          01:55:30       Yeah, of course. Um, what do you see happening in your lifetime? I mean we are right now in 2012 this was supposed to be, if you're paying attention to time wave zero novelty theory to supposed to be wearing when the shit hits the fan. When you on have found recently, I've talked about this recently, but I wanted to bring it up with you, cause I know you're a mckenna fan as well. He altered the end date to coincide with the end date of the Mayan calendar. Yeah. Maybe he was a of the people that believe that by creating a social movement around these ideas, you more quickly actualize those ideas. People were, so you cited me for bringing this up, but somebody had posted it on my message board and then I went and read and he apparently his initial calculations was November, November of 2012 to December, moved to December 21st which is the, you know, the end date of long count.

Speaker 4:          01:56:15       But then somebody brought up the other day, there was like a Internet meme going around where, you know, calculate leap years, did the Mayans calculate leap peers? Cause if they didn't, we know that all this shit all happened 700 years ago. Oh yeah. I mean I, the specifics, I have no idea what the sciences, but I think what's interesting is that if you create a viral swell 10 times the scale of the Joseph Kony video with some beautifully produced message about how mankind is using technology to create a global brain and it addressed the problems of humanity and it's seen by a billion people by December on Youtube, then the idea becomes reality. Because this is what we've been talking about. You know, ideas are just as real as the neurons that they inhabit. So that's what's crazy. It's a self fulfilling propers Joseph Kony video. We talked about this, but I remember when it hit Twitter, when I saw it, when I saw it starting to appear in my timeline, I started thinking, wow, what's going to happen here?

Speaker 4:          01:57:11       Like this is, this seems like a very orchestrated campaign and the idea to make a a terrible person, very famous so that he's, he's a target of five more. Yeah. What a genius idea. Geez. And you know, that really is just sort of tapping into potential tapping into which no one else has done before. No one else has ever done that about a terrible person. No, no. It's very, yeah, it's interesting. So interesting. It's brilliant. Yeah. And it just, the use of media and understanding its power and applying it for savvy social impact. What are the criticisms of this Kony video? Cause I know there's a few of the criticism I think has to do specifically with, with with the nonprofit operations tales. But look again, that's something, that's a whole other conversation and we're in it. We're not experts and we don't know the facts.

Speaker 4:          01:57:56       But I think what's interesting is what they've made with the video, what that video means about the future of how messages get spread that we were seeing. We all realized, we all know where we were when the Kony video hit. It's one of those things where it's like something has changed here and we're all aware that, okay this is, this is a new paradigm. It's a paradigm shift, not even a paradigm shift. You know what's really fascinating is Obama, the Obama campaign is releasing. There's, this is where they're so social media, brilliant savvy. They understand aesthetics in their campaign. They had the director of an inconvenient truth is about to release a documentary. So like a well made film about Obama and that's going to be part of their campaign media materials. So instead of like an ad, like a normal attack ad like the other guys are doing, and these guys are releasing a film made by a talented film maker. I mean

Speaker 1:          01:58:42       the brilliance of that, that's probably going to go ridiculously viral. That's the best campaign video you could have ever done. What is that going to come out? I don't know the dates, but people should Google the WHO knew about whenever it's just a trailer. I wonder if it's gonna be free or like Louis Ck. I wonder if it's going to be like a Kim Kardashian reality TV show where you know that they've created artificial scenarios to move the plot along. Yeah. Like Obama is Obama. We got you at a carwash now. What? It was like Mexican food. I don't want Mexican food. Now you're going to be washing the car. Imagine if they actually did it. They produce it like a reality show. Yeah. What's happened is the most ridiculous shit ever. I haven't seen it. I wonder what it's going to be. Something tells me it's going to be a well made film with beautiful music and well, it'd be nice to see him talk outside of that fake sort of, I'm giving a speech voice.

Speaker 1:          01:59:25       Yeah, exactly. You know, she'd be like a documentary that followed him and you get behind the scenes. All the fake, I'm giving a speech voice is very disturbing because it's too smooth. It's not real. It's too polished. It's not. It's not. You know, I know it's prepared and beaten down to, I don't want that out of a leader. You know what I want out of a leader is I want, I want to know that this is who this is you. This isn't, um, being a strip club Dj. This isn't on the am morning Chi on the zoo coming up next. The same fucking voice. When you hear a man give a speech and you know the, there's that way of talking. That is so God damn fake. It should be illegal. They shouldn't be able to stop you from making campaigns in speeches and stop you and go.

Speaker 1:          02:00:08       You can't talk like that. It'll be interesting to see, to see how it comes across. And speaking of, of politicians, they just see the HBO movie about a Game Change. What is it? What's game chats about the Mccain? Oh, about Sarah Palin when he picked his writing man watching the more Sarah Palin. Well it's Julianne Moore was so good in it. Dude. It's pretty hot. She looks just like her. Yeah. But like the film is so upsetting and really well cause it shows you the theater of what a lot of politics has become obsolete. It is. And how accurate is it accurate? The conversations, I mean it's all been doctored up for fucking dramatic effect. You know, you need to see a man, I think you still get the message, you still get the idea of the reasons that she was put there and her lack of experience and well that became painfully obvious.

Speaker 1:          02:00:57       Right. But here it's presented in a, the way it would be like a film scholar, you know, explaining something to you guys. It just illustrates how wonky the system is. And that could even be an option or how could that be an option? Exactly. [inaudible] would allow that. Well, you know, it's what I've always said is the real problem is that there's really fucking dumb people out there, a lot of them. And they get to vote too. And the problem with dumb people as they don't know, they're dumb. So when they see someone like Sarah Pailin who may not be the smartest person in the world, but she's way smarter than them, they can't distinguish between her and Stephen Hawking's. When Neil Tyson speaks, he sounds just as brilliant as Sarah Pailin because they're both way out of their fucking league. Most people can barely string together a sentence. And so these are the people that came to her cause she represents simplicity.

Speaker 1:          02:01:47       She represents, I think today with old fashion things and hunting, well she's family cause safe danger with her. She's dangerous. But because, but she's also familiar. So maybe that's why, but like fuck, I feel like today man, if you have access to the internet, you have no excuse not to be on Khan Academy. You have no excuse not to be watching Ted talks. You have no excuse not to saturate your brain with knowledge. Like it's not like there's no books around like the every book that's ever been written is an internet click way. And I feel like ignorance is inexcusable these days. If you have an internet connection. So it's kind of like a, I don't know, like it feels like the, you know, the tools are there, but it's up to us how we use them. It's going back to the same message and I think people really, they need to need to get on this, right?

Speaker 1:          02:02:30       They need to get on this. The representative government ideas gotta go, that's, that's not necessary anymore. We can all instantly communicate with the, you know, the government. We can instantly decide what, what we agree with. We can, we can have our voices heard. The idea that we have senators and congressmen or the other, and they're in this position where they get to vote for their district shop. A fascinating idea. Yeah, that's a ridiculous idea. That's not even that, that's not, see everybody looks at it at democracy as if like you get a say, you get to vote, but you don't get to say shit. You get a say in who you pick, who gets you in a position. But democracy needs to come online, man. Like the whole hundred percent needs to be revamped. They need to throw out all representations, sores. The Internet needs to be voted on new constitutional amendment and they should people who have jobs, but those jobs are to carry out the will of the people, not to represent the totem pole.

Speaker 1:          02:03:20       The people can represent themselves. When is somebody going to make a Joseph Kony style video about legalizing marijuana? And if people say, click here and play this to say yes and if it gets a billion views, they'll have to legalize. It could already see just Google the union man. Go Watch the movie of the Union, the business behind getting high. It's a documentary that I was involved in, the my friend Adam score you produced. It was like, I don't know, it was like four or five years ago at least that we did this. So one of the best documentaries on the, the reality behind the illegalization of marijuana and the reality behind how how big of a businesses and how many fucking people use it. Dude, I have done my family that benefit from its medicinal medicinal use and they've benefited immensely. It's been like a miracle for my aunt.

Speaker 1:          02:04:03       It's one of those plants, one of those substances, one of those elements of our culture and society that if you were, again, if you were looking at life as a work of fiction, if life was a movie and there was a some plant in the movie that was incredibly beneficial, not just to the culture, not just to instilling a sense of camaraderie and people not just to fort making you inquisitive, main, uh, a turbo charger for your imagination, making sex feel better, not just all of these things, but then it creates a superior fiber that you can make clothes out of. It's way more horrible than cotton. It makes a much more superior paper and you could put it in an area, in a can, in four months. It can be ready to process. Whereas it takes fucking years to grow trees in the same area.

Speaker 1:          02:04:45       Plus it outproduces the trees in the same acreage by something like four to one. I mean, it's amazing. It has the amino acids that you can live off of. You can use it to make fuel. You can make him, boy, it becomes preposterous busters. But imagine a video that's slickly produced that the Kony video that gets a billion views. Let's do it. Let's do it. You and me do those 10 minutes. Did you get your specialty? We'll pump it up on new bill in California, a Dui bill that they're going to make it a zero tolerance Dui. If you have any weed in your system or in a marijuana and marijuana, he's, he stays in your system does six weeks. How could they do it? That's like saying punishing you for being drunk two days ago and it would pretty much make anyone that smokes weed.

Speaker 1:          02:05:29       Well that's silly. They don't have to, they're not going to pick it up to get a urine test from you and they wouldn't know what they would be allowed to do if they pull you over. Oh, that's so ridiculous. That's, you know, the, the real, the real problem with that as a science is not the same. It doesn't, the marijuana does not treat people or it doesn't affect people the same way that alcohol does, period. I'm not saying you should go out and get high and drive around, but I'm saying some people can drive high and they're fine and that is a fact, you know, and you might not want to address it because it seems like it's a taboo subject and you know when people want to dance around it, it is not getting drunk. Getting drunk is something that really severely impairs your ability to operate machines that your ability to walk your niche and are very different things.

Speaker 1:          02:06:07       Very, very, very different. It's not a good idea to be in any altered state of consciousness while you're responsible for others. That's all we get. The self driving cars. That's why the Google self driving cars are so perfectly baked as fucking a Google car. Google car could be Cheech and Chong to the Max. Yes. Completely filled with smoke. So they open up those side going door. Shoot, everybody gets driving time. Yes, and it'll be the self driving car. It's perfectly safe. The computer does, it doesn't get high, dude. You're a Google fanboy a little bit, right. I'm kind of a fan of anybody who's pushing the boundaries of the possible does. Of course I'm a Google fanboy. Yes, I'm lycos all the way. Whoa, Bro. I'm Netflix. Netflix or no, no, no. What was the other one? Net. No, Netscape. That's it. Number. Netscape. Netscape.

Speaker 1:          02:06:53       Search. Search. Yeah. There was like a search part of it, I think. Does that make sense? I thought it was always a browser. I didn't, well there was the blue of the earliest search engines before Google. There was, that wasn't the first search engines. I remember Alta Vista Vista hype. I don't remember. Light goes, I remember liking this then. So how did those go away and how did Google just stormed the beach? How invaded man innovative? It is like natural selection. It's like winning because winning the game, Microsoft is trying so hard with this whole big thing. First of all, why being, what does that mean? What do you say? It's Google, bing. It's probably the second best one. It's pretty good. But

Speaker 4:          02:07:36       why being, why call it being, why is it Google? Why is Google? Because Google is a number, dude. It's a very cool number. Actually. I already know about it until recently. That's like a term for like a gigantic like twill. Yeah. There's like a million zeros or some shit. Well, let's, let's find out what it is. What is it? Google here because we'll, we should, uh, foreign people. It comes from another term. It doesn't, I don't believe that the word is Google. It's a, it's a preview of a term. Yeah. Google. It's G. O. G. O. L. Yeah. And it is. Holy Shit. How many, oh my God. 100 zeroes. It is the, wow. Uh, Google is the large number. 10 to a hundred. That is the digit one followed by 100 zero. What a great way to make a statement about the depth and breadth of your capabilities by using a number like that.

Speaker 4:          02:08:24       It's kind of beautiful. And how perfect. What a perfect description. It's perfect for Google. That is Google. Then Google voicemail. Google fucking maps. Google cheeses. So I am so excited to speak there. Yeah. What are you gonna talk about? I want to talk about creativity. I'm going to talk about innovation. I'm talking about inspiration in awe. I'm going to talk about using technology to render the impossible into existence. And I'm going to show some of the videos. Actually my friend Josh Kaplan actually who set this up is a huge fan of your show. Oh that's awesome. He loves your podcasts and so Josh and he set up the invite to Google. So that's amazing that man, that's incredible. You know, Google is known as being one of those companies that really treats their employees well. You know, that's like a, we got an invite a couple of years ago when we were in San Francisco, maybe a year ago.

Speaker 4:          02:09:12       So I'm someone from Google emailed me, but I lost it in the shuffle. My, my email gets clogged sometimes. Like I just can't find anyone because you get a lot of crazy, you must get a lot of emails in general, Huh? Yeah. But, but the one thing that I was fascinated by, what I wanted to see, what it was like in there, cause I've always thought like, man, why can't someone make a company where they treat their employees well? Like, how much more does it cost to give them really good food, take care of them. It might cost like a little more, but wouldn't make the atmosphere way better and make connections. So yeah, I mean that's like one of the most important things is that the environment be positive. Totally. Nobody wants to work around someone who doesn't want to work their creativity. And productivity comes from allowing people to have distractions.

Speaker 4:          02:09:53       So it's like they have ping pong tables, bean bags and all these things because you know, and some people might criticize, oh, it's just a playground. Actually. No, it probably makes the employees much more creative. You're creating spaces in which the free association and their services can fire and yes, that's, creativity is about that. It's been, I'm sure there are judged or at least evaluated based on the productivity. It's not like they're not going to be in the law of God this job, Tom, just play ping pong. Right, right. And not the type of people that will do that in the first place. So it becomes a resource rather than a distraction. And it distraction as a resource. And these are the postindustrial revolution companies. These are the most admired companies in the world. You have apple, you have Google, and people are looking to these companies as examples of how to run businesses, how to have social impact, how to make legacies, how to not be evil.

Speaker 4:          02:10:37       And they still don't like this is new model against the core of, of, of corporations are going to be judged upon. So all the new entrepreneurs now coming online, they're getting inspired from these companies, right? I want it may be the next Google and change the world. It's not, I want to make the next Google and be rich. I want to change the world. And what happens with like Google video and stuff? Cause I know they came out against Sopa and the, the Stop online piracy act and they kinda, that all fell apart and they're trying to rig come up with a new strategy, a new new, uh, a new act. Well, I think we need to, we need to all have a new conversation about content ownership in a world in which everybody has the tools to make mixed tapes. So, yeah, but like what about Google videos and stuff like that?

Speaker 4:          02:11:13       What if someone has a documentary and the documentary is for sale, but you go to Google video and there it is and you can just watch it for free. What is a no, no, you, you do what Radiohead did, which is where they put their album online for free and they said donate money, donate money if you would like to pay for this music. But if you think that that's how people who want to sell DVDs should deal with the fact that people are stealing their shit, they're going to have to ask for donations. Well, no, but I think that we're just, it's an invited a lot of which more because what happens is everybody's going to be making content for free and way and the content for free is going to be just as good as the content you charge for. And I think people will pay because they appreciate your content, but I think it's going to be harder and harder to like impose payment.

Speaker 4:          02:11:54       Well, how would someone, like let's say for an example, say if there's a documentary on crocodiles. Okay, I told you about it. Oh my God, it's crazy. You got to watch this. Now you go to Google video and you find this documentary or crocodiles, how the fuck are you going to find the production company? The website? You got to search it out. Are you going to go Google the name of it and you're saying you were just watching the website, watch it on youtube. I mean if you really wanted to set up, they had it set up where you could, you know where you could donate if you would like on their website. I mean, well no, they can. So they can do a youtube channel that supported by ads and if lots of people watch the movie, they'll get money from the ads that they have on their page and then they, in the description, they can say, we're putting this movie online for free because we want to share the ideas, but we're asking for donations of $5 a view.

Speaker 4:          02:12:35       And I'm sure that a lot of people would give it. A lot of people would. A lot of people wouldn't as well though. Do you? So do you feel like that is, and then there's the audit. The other argument is the people that wouldn't as well. I kind of see their point of view because they would, they would say, listen, I would've never bought this in the first place so I'm not taking anything away from them. I downloaded it because it was free because I knew I could watch it and I didn't like it. So I'm glad that it would get my map. When you see a bad name, you don't, you want to get your money back. Yes. I mean there's, I can see that argument as well. You know, it is a weird, it's one of the Zeros and it's just being distributed through the Internet. It's, it's a weird, because conversations only have a price because of scarcity. Right. Charged for something because it's a rare commodity. No, that also people things have a price because you, I mean there's no scarcity in artwork. I mean you're not, you know, when your work is yours unique, so people pay for it because it's only you did something that's unique to you and if you have an audience, because I say it for, that's what I'm saying, but I think that uh, increasingly scarcity stayed stating them for their

Speaker 2:          02:13:32       efforts. I mean it's not necessarily just paying for scarcity, it's you're compensating someone honestly because you were efforts, you appreciate the efforts. But I think that it's just the genie's out of the bottle. It's just too difficult for immaterial things to be contained. Do you think that ultimately that's going to lead to sort of a decay in the idea of capitalism and the, you know, the thing is going to be doing exams. Everything is going to be reexamined, but when they start getting into like real high end three d printers and that's how you order things, you just ordered the formula transform manufacturing as well, man. Yeah. And then the, then those people will get scared and lose their jobs and we'll have moments of panic and all of that transition will change everything. But you know that like 80% of the jobs that people do today didn't exist a hundred years ago.

Speaker 2:          02:14:12       There were jobs that didn't exist. So there will be new things for us to do. It becomes a real problem when people hold on to the idea that they need to keep a job and because the job is a part of the old way. And that is also one of the reasons why marijuana is still illegal. And there was a recent article that I tweeted, if you find it just a couple of days ago or just Google the, uh, the statement lobbyists are getting rich off keeping marijuana illegal because that's what's going on, man. Right? There's lobbyists that are doing this through a police unions. You know, there's lobbyists that are doing this and they're there. You know, these guys are making a lot of money off keeping marijuana illegal. There's a lot of people that their bishops, yeah, well their business is to arrest people for pod. Cause I mean that's part of the job.

Speaker 2:          02:14:54       It's part of what keeps people paid. It's part of what keeps us strong. Police Force. But even, but I think that in a country where most of the population at this point wants it to be legalized, there should be no red tape or bureaucracy between the peoples oil and it being changed. I think it's also, most people want it to be legalized. They should be like a like button on Facebook and if 100 million people click it, it should be legalized tomorrow. And I think she will eventually. Yeah, that's, that's dynamic democracies. Things that we'll need to get, one of the issues is, um, and I think this has to be stopped is we have to stop treating police officers as glorified revenue collectors. Cause that's what they are. And I think that's a really disgusting thing because guess what, firefighters and place, and I hope we never have to fucking use them.

Speaker 2:          02:15:35       I hope those guys get to hang out at the firehouse all day and cook and work out and do fucking Chin ups and shit. And I hope no one ever has to work. I hope no one ever has to deal with the faculty. I would like the same thing with police officers. Right. It would be great if they never had to take the guns out. There was never anything for them. The issue is they have quotas. They have quotas they have to reach. I had no idea. Oh fuck. Yeah. Especially with speeding. You know, I've talked to friends. They have quotas. Yes, absolutely. Yeah, they have. They have to make quotas as far as giving out tickets, so that really raises a red flag, like telling a firefighter that you're only going to get paid if you put out a fire or something. I'm going to be looking to build fires. Imagine what would happen if the entire country decided that for one month, which would fuck up the entire system. That's all we need is 30 days. Everybody in agreement where nobody ever violates a single law as far as speeding or driving traffic or stoplights. We made a viral video for it. Recruiting campaign. Don't break a law for a month. Every cop and get fired. It would be cas. Wow. Yeah. It'd be crazy. They would lose all that revenue

Speaker 1:          02:16:29       that they count on. They count on us. Never evolving. I mean it's really factored into the budget. So we need massive system upgrades here. Massive systemic system. It's the idea that you have engineered a system where we can never be good, we can never get through because you, you, you're cops need to arrest a certain amount of people need to pull over rather a certain amount of people and put out a certain amount of tickets. The, the state relies on that for revenue. We're going to have to radically change everything. Will radically change. No, but there was a time when, you know, somebody's life was about making saddles for horses, you know, cause everybody had horses and that person was probably really nervous when the car started to become popular because it couldn't make his horse carriages anyone. Lucky for him. Lesbians are still around and it's still like horses.

Speaker 1:          02:17:10       I wouldn't say lesbians, I'd say women who used to like men but gave up. Now they like horses. I don't know man. I live right in the question district and I see him every day and some of them are fucking high. These are like spoiled little girls that date like rich guys that by the models and shit, you gotta fuck those girls hard man. They ride horses all day. They're used to, they're not impressed by just like regular sex riding a giant animal, you must feel so feeble, you know? You know what I'm saying? They get on top of you. They're like, really? This is it. This is all you got to their next level of Madison. I always feel bad for the horses, man. It's chains around their mouths. I'm like, no man. Yeah, I don't like it. It's gross. It's gross. There's a lot of people in my neighborhood and they're like super self righteous, like you know, slow down.

Speaker 1:          02:17:51       You can be like, it's 28 miles, you know the speed limits. 25 you're going 28 slow down, slow down. Just big, big bull dyke on her fucking crazy animal. It's a weird thing. You're allowed to just ride around animals in 2012 someone should come along and you know, really just go to a farm somewhere. You can't be just, you know, I don't care if this is a question you district. That's ridiculous. It still Berbick you crazy. Fuck. We do doing riding a horse my neighborhood soon. We won't. We won't eat animals either. I'm really convinced about in vitro meat, man. No one's going to have to eat those fucking animals. That's a problem because what happens then? What do we do? Eat, sterilize them. What do we do to keep them from just being everywhere? Like in India? What's it? You know, what does it like if you drive everywhere in his fucking cows are like rats in New York City.

Speaker 1:          02:18:36       Just infesting the landscape and we can't eat them. Some of them have to kill him, Bro. And we're going to have to deal introduced triceratops. Maybe we want to get some dinosaurs breed as many. I mean, that's an option. What if we just let them go? Right? If we let them go without eating them anymore, we let them go. They're going to fuck. They're going, fuck, am I going to be like Buffalo, Buffalo Plains? Just grow the tissue where they're going to be everywhere. System. Oh Man, I dunno. I think, uh, if we want to stay human, I think they're going to keep up. They're going to keep breeding. I think we're going to have to get, predators are going to have to make some robot predators like those dog robot things that only just go out and jack cows. Interesting. They just do it to keep the population down. Who knows, man. And we to be, it's going to be dry. Just shook his head. I'll have to add a new scenario now. The new scenarios, we'll come in, we'll find new novel solutions to do, eat meal with them. Do eat meat. I eat meat. Not every day, but I'm a flexitarian.

Speaker 4:          02:19:28       Flexitarian. You're flexible. I know I eat meat but I just, I try not to eat it every day. Did you ever consider the idea that what you're doing is harmful to the energy of the university or you know, eating tortured animals? Uh, never fuck with you ever watch like food inc or I try to have organic food, but I still, you know, that's like a cow that grows up in the hippie community and they get shot in the head. I don't know. It still gets jacked. I would like to become vegetarian. It's just, it's not the easiest thing to do logistically. You know? Now you can't always find it right now. You're going to get a swarm of hate mail from right now from sweaty little vegans, vegetarians, they're warming up their little fingers right now. Well, I'm a flexitarian. I mean not, not you.

Speaker 4:          02:20:07       An open minded person. Food twice a week is already really good at you're making it. That's the beginning. That's decent. That's the beginning. No, no, eight, no. Yeah, I think animals are dumb and I think uh, if they were smart, they'd be killing us. I think we'd have issues. I think every animal is playfully. We get to where our empathy is big enough to alleviate suffering. Even co even suffering if it's not compliantly. I agree as a cycle of life requires predators and we have sort of can completely hijack that cycle of life with the idea of cities and civilization and a big metal boxes were contrived through fucking safari and be 10 feet away from a lion killing a gazelle. I mean we've got a crazy game changers. Men were complete game changing species for good or for bad. I think more for good.

Speaker 4:          02:20:52       I think I'm more impressed with with us than I am that I am disturbed by us. I long shot much more impressed with us though, but it's nice to just kind of to marvel, let ourselves a little bit. I think we have kind of a, what's it called, a guilty cosmic complex where we feel like we're small and insignificant and I think we have a big role to play and can play an even bigger role if we pool our cognitive resources together. I agree, but I also agree the big is delicious and so steak and a that you can grow bacon out of like stem cells, like a print ad to kill another animal, print das to Bacon. You're never going to be able to recreate venison. You never going to be able to retain a special no. Venison is dear me. Oh, okay. Totally recreate.

Speaker 4:          02:21:33       There's a delicious Gamey, wild flavor. Tell how much shit ones and Zeros you think they'll be able to figure that out. Yeah, man. He'll be like in the matrix when a guy's eating the steak and he's like, I know this is not real. I know it's made of like code. He's like, I don't care. It tastes delicious and it puts it in his mouth. So you gotta be satisfied with that. I think we all say it's inevitable, right? It's inevitable. We'll do it. I mean, what are we tasting anyway? Except our brain's interpretation of something going in through sensors that are like creating a software that goes in real time and tells us, Oh, this is what this feels like. I'm glad I got to experience life with no answering machines. I'm glad I got to experience no cell phones when I was growing up.

Speaker 4:          02:22:11       So you could see the contrast. Absolutely. Absolutely. Does it make you appreciate how much higher do you are now? I appreciate how wired we are now, but I also appreciate old school stuff. I appreciate, I appreciate a good steak. You know, I like a good steak. Hardwood. Coles grilled is amen. Cooking with cooking with fire was a technology to yeah, it is. Yeah. So yeah, absolutely. I mean, look what the appendix exists to. It was an Oregon to break down fibers we eat and all kinds of crazy shit back then, wasn't it? I mean it wasn't there. What it was, we lost its use and that's why a lot of people have to, have you ever gotten your, uh, your genome tested to see what percentage? 20 tall. You are 23 and me, the Google thing, you were talking about it and it's not completely, I mean it's not, it's not like they can understand everything.

Speaker 4:          02:22:58       Someone's a monkey and it's trying to dump it on technology. Yeah. It's one of those exponential things where eventually they'll, it'll be 100% tell you everything about everything. Do you have to, right now at least it tells you, did you spit in a cup or something like that? You said, how do you do it? What do you do is send you this little tube twenty3@aol.com yeah, 23 minutes. Amazing. I'll tell you if you have like a precut, a precondition of some sorts, or if you have a likelihood of developing something like high blood pressure, if your genetic profile says you're going to get Parkinson's, are the percentages of a chance of developing something. So for people who get stuff that's preventable, you know, if they're like, oh, I have a 70% chance of high blood pressure, I can start addressing that now. I've been told that I'm more likely to get it in another person so I can change my diet now because some people are just genetically so lucky that they can eat shit.

Speaker 4:          02:23:44       Nothing will ever happen to them. Fuckers. Yeah, that's always the case until we all upgrade our genes, but for everybody else, this is a chance to see what some of their vulnerabilities might be and how they might address them. So we start to hack our biology. How cool is this idea that we all start hacking our biology. We're upgrading ourselves by hacking in and getting back door and are we short cuts and forcing? Are we delaying the inevitable brilliant next stage of existence? Are we in this light? You mean that may be will be something after this stage is way better and that's the natural progress. The natural progress is to move from this to the next. That could only be the case. If this is a simulation and we are went to the waking up from the simulation. If this is a lucid dream, if this is limbo from inception, you know that you spend 80 years in limbo and you get old before you wake up and become a young man again.

Speaker 4:          02:24:33       But if that's the case, great look, awesome. I fucking hope so man. I'm just not fully convinced so I'm going to fight for my survival as passionately as I can now because I have the evidence that there's anything else. No evidence. It's pretty hopeless. Fair is pretty vivid. It might be the big sleep it turned any on both ends. Why can't any of the universe is eternal? Why can't we be? That's my, I think consciousness probably goes to sleep forever, but I think you should come a part of, is it maybe consciousness is really a tool to create action. Maybe it's a tool to move things forward. There's no doubt that it is, but it's a tool that found out that it enjoys it so it wants to proceed. It likes blowjob. Joy's itself drunk. We're self referential. It's that recursive feedback loop. We know that. We know that we know and therefore consciousness. If it was a fluke or if it was by like emergent design, it has decided that it likes itself. Sure.

Speaker 1:          02:25:24       It likes like, you know, it likes free time. It likes to make art and sing songs. Not everything that it does is to build things and to be utilitarian and functional thumbs things are pure pleasure. The robots in blade runner, pleasure of being alive as well. There you go. So that could be what it is, right? Yeah. Rutger Hauer. Remember? He really liked it. Yeah. Who's bummed down? Yeah. Crazy kangaroos. Kangaroos. Kangaroos. Who eat a flower. That came from another planet. I'm telling you, man, it's super intelligent kangaroos. Would that be the shit of Kangaroos? Started yelling at you for fucking polluting Kangaroos? Started talking to English like really quick a couple of years and they were Catholic school growing and amazing about Kangaroos is that they continue to raise, they have that thing, you know the pouch, the pouch, little babies, but it's almost like when the baby's born, it's almost like not ready to be born.

Speaker 1:          02:26:15       And so they kept him in there and that's kind of like, well, they live in a terrible environment. Yeah. I mean they have to protect that fucking thing. It's kind of amazing. They live in where there's crocodiles everywhere, right? Kangaroos or that's a bad spot. Yeah. Australia's those shady fucking spot. The most venomous snakes. Oh, they got all this shit that can kill you. And most of the country, you can't live in most of the country. Nobody lives in. Well, they live or on the coast for that. It's happening more and more, more, more, more people moving to cities. Man, most of the population lives in cities and will continue to live in and they found a reef of ancient bile. Ancient like a simple organism. Shit that is like some, it's the 650 fucking million years old. Some insane. So it predated the, the idea of life on this planet and they founded in Australia.

Speaker 1:          02:27:00       Yeah. Australia is, it's a crazy spot. It would be fun to go. Yeah, I've been a few times. I've been to Sydney, Sydney twice. Great people. Really Nice people man. I said I hear and they have no ozone over there man. They got real cancer problems like all over their billboards are these pictures, they have like these uh, skin cancer campaigns. So there's photos of people with big giant stitched up scars talk about getting, cause everyone's getting chunks taken out of them. But you go out there and the, you know, in the, in the sun with no sunscreen on, you get fucked up man. Sunscreen. Yeah. It's another level son with the ozone layer. This giant hole in the ozone over that long to get there. I like 17 hours or something. Not Quite. I think 15 something like that. I want to go, it's a lot want to go.

Speaker 1:          02:27:42       But you know what, if you, if you can deal with that just one day. I mean, you know what you do is man, get a bunch of podcast, get a bunch of podcasts, get a few movies on your iPad and just zone out and just goes in and say, this is what I'm doing. And don't freak out and don't feel like, fuck, I got to get up, move around. Just, just deal with it. Ain't no big a deal. And then once you get there, Holy Shit. It's a beautiful, beautiful country. It's so gorgeous. It's so amazing when you think that the people from England cause that as a prison colony at one point in time, you know, like what a, what a silly idea. Fascinating. Now all their actors win all the awards. Yeah. I wonder why they're so good. Yeah. Australian and British actors, man, they bring it end ups to Jim Jefferies.

Speaker 1:          02:28:23       Really funny. Standup from uh, Australia. Yeah. And there's a couple of Americans that do really well with their, like Eddie aft and Arch Barker. They go over there and they're the arch Barker's fucking enormous over there apparently. Yeah. Yeah. And they just really, like when I was in Australia, I was talking to people like, what do you do? I'm like, Oh, I'm a comedian. Like, you know, ODG Parka immediately. Wow. Yeah. Yeah. It's uh, it's so close to like, it's nothing like America, but you could totally hang out there. Like you could live there. Like you wouldn't have to learn a language. People are very friendly. You'd have no problems. It feels slightly alternate universe. Yes, they speak English, but it's just another, another reality. It's so far away that they drive on the other side of the road. Right. That freaks you out. Right? Totally. That whole England thing is a trip, Alison Wonderland.

Speaker 1:          02:29:09       It's like, why are you on this site traveling so cool though, for shifting people's sense of like reality. Oh yeah. Expanding your consciousness because you're immersed in a sort of mirror world where it's like, well, most things are kind of the same, but they're a little off. Yeah. So it's like reality has shifted a little bit. I think it's a traveling, so it's cool to see like culture like Australia where w you know, socially, you know, it was really kind of like parallel to America, like really similar. I mean not exact but, but really similar. Like if you go over there and you meet an Australian guy who your age, chances are you've got to have a lot of things to talk about in common and it won't be very, it'd be different but not alien at all. So it's kind of interesting that that is happening on the other side of the planet, right?

Speaker 1:          02:29:47       There's like some sort of, uh, you know, you're there, you're modern civilization and they're like, these people live here and the dream here and the wake up and they go to work. I scrape living. There are higher lines with a whole different set of priorities that have no bearing on my existence and that I didn't know about it until they came here. And what really makes you trip out is when you watch their TV shows and they have like really popular TV shows, you fucking never heard about her though. When a guy comes out and the girl comes out, you know who the fuck are these people? And everybody goes crazy. Everybody goes crazy. Number one show in Australia, my, I can't believe they're really on right now and everybody will sit down and get drunk. It's amazing. It gives you perspective also just you from your reality on hinges you a little bit.

Speaker 1:          02:30:23       The one thing that I consistently get when I go to these places is how uptight America is. You know when you go and you, especially for Australia, they're so fun and they're so easy to hang out with and so generally friendly. It makes you feel like why? What does this law, what's responsible for this level of tension in America? Well, he's responsible. It's not everywhere by the way. Of course there's a lot of cool people in America. Don't get me wrong, I get a lot of Douche bag dummy tweets like whoo, whoo, move to have grooves doing viewed America that I hate America. Stupid is what I love American. I think America should be awesome. I mean it is awesome, but it should be better than what it is. It's possible for us to improve and what holds us back? It's fuck heads like you.

Speaker 1:          02:31:03       That's what holds us back. Tweet Twitter. We need this guy. There should be no reason why the cutting edge to be uptight about things particularly like social issues that we need to like completely legalized gay marriage everywhere we need to legalize marijuana. Rick Santorum. Cause he disagrees. Rick Santorum had have a really interesting point though. I've got to admit, I mean I am a always a 100% in support of gay marriage. I'm, you know, I think she'd be able to do whatever the fuck you want to do. It's not as, it's not hurting me. It's not a scam. It's not hurting me. It's not like you're trying to steal money means it's not her. Right. So I'm completely in support of that. But he had a really interesting point that Rick Santorum, cause he was talking about marriage, has always been for over a thousand years, has been defined as a man and a woman.

Speaker 1:          02:31:43       Now all of a sudden you're calling it marriage, but it's a man and a man. Can it be a man and two men? And I was like, Oh shit. Like he just flipped it on its head like he really did. It was a really good point because a, and I was like, well yeah, well why can't it be two men? Why can't, why can't two, two men get married to a guy? Why can't everybody just bang each other? Why not? Why not? Why not? Yeah, but, but he was, the women in the audience were saying, no, that's a different scenario. You're talking about a couple that's in love. And she's like, well no. What if these people are all in love? There's three of them would have, you know, can it be two women and a man? Can it be two men and women and then, you know, he just fucked him up, man.

Speaker 1:          02:32:19       He just fucked them up. There's nothing they can say then cause you know, he's really right. Like first of all, as a personal freedom, uh, issue, I'd feel like you should be able to whenever you want. If it's not hurting me clearly, clearly gay marriage is not hurting me. So do whatever the fuck you want. But if you want to call it marriage, like maybe they should call it, maybe it should be something different. Maybe it's marriage, but it's gay marriage. Oh, we're gay. Married. No, like me and my partner, a gay married. You wouldn't be able to say regular married while we're triple married. Oh there's three of you. Yeah, we'll get to it. What would you call that if you made that legal, what would you call that? Domestic partnership. Domestic domestic partners. If they want to call them married. This is my one to where they want to know, but you know, and then they get all the benefits of society and they wanted like do tax stuff together and all those things that people want.

Speaker 1:          02:33:04       Why not? Corporations can have like a hundreds of employees or thousands of employees. Maybe marriages should be able to as well. So 100,000 people in a marriage you're down with like they can be many nation states, married style polygamy. I got a Time magazine. No, that's different because those are getting minors involved. Right. And coercing people and imposing reality tunnels and you'd have a tying access to other media. Like it's different. I've got a Time magazine home and there's a guy on the cover, one of those last holdout old man, Mormon dude who has a, a gang of wives and uh, still still rocking it is one dude, nine wives and he's got 46 children. What the fuck? What it would be thrown in jail? What the fuck man? Yeah, that's crazy. Do you know that a lot of those guys, uh, we talked about this before.

Speaker 1:          02:33:50       Who Was it? What did we brought up this, uh, that they went to Mexico, that a lot of Mormons were traveling to Mexico and they were having problems with the cartels. They established these polygamous communities down in Mexico. Oh Wow. And I was having problems with the drug cartels and someone was assassinated lane. Remember that? I remember who brought it up. One of our guests brought it up and I'm like, wow. I had no idea that that was even going down. Right. They've set up these alternative communities down in Mexico. Do you ever think about that? Like what if somebody just decided to like turn Costa Rica and the Goddamn Paradise? Everybody said they're just trying to do it. The world's all fucked up everywhere else. But here's the deal. We have a limited government. We were going to establish the best schools possible libertarian. Yes, yes. Social, you know, a care possible. The best healthcare, the best community centers where we, you know, we, we have people who are, you know, set up to take care of stray children and really create a society where

Speaker 3:          02:34:44       there's a guy called Patri Friedman who had this thing called the seasteading institute, which is a organization that, and they're backed by like Peter Teal and everything and giant island. Yeah. To make these artificial manmade islands where we can do practice runs a futuristic versions of governance and they can be an international waters, but now they're doing something with a Central American nation where the nation has given them a chunk of land to let them set up their own autonomous zone. Where was his wares in Central America? It was Nicaragua or Guatemala or one of those, but they're going to, they're going to try. It has been all these articles about it and they're going to test out futuristic cutting edge forms of government.

Speaker 1:          02:35:19       See, I'm, the only thing I worry about is one of the beautiful things about doing things in America, even though you're under the shadow of the military industrial complex, is that it's fairly safe. You know it's fairly safe. Yes, yes. And every month you can't, you, you, you know, unless you're, I mean, where are you going to recreate that? We're going to recreate that. You're not going to go to an open waters cause if you do it in international waters, what are these Somali pirate dudes? You hear about that shit every day and what do you, what are you going to do it? You've got a bunch of peace fucking floating spot out there. The big concrete floating Django with what? Paul? The security guard who patrols the perimeter. They shoot Paul on the head. Fucking tig over. God dammit. Jason Silva got to be ready for war. Yeah, I know it looks, I mean I think that is obviously logistical things that have to be addressed, but it's a very ambitious idea to begin. It's very ambitious. You would have to have guns, a emote. We have to have laser beams, right? You get that trash pile it and live in the middle of it. That's not a bad deal. One wants to get near that thing here. Hear people come in to, but then we're going to get your water from your water, from the ocean desalinization course. It's going to be a,

Speaker 3:          02:36:21       they're trying to do dean Kamen who invented a lot of these water purification systems, man that you can put in like hearing bacteria infection like poison almost into the water and it comes out like ready to drink. Why we have this new unit that they're going to be taken to like rural parts around the world, um, to these little villages and that's like the number one cause of disease and illness and dirty water. Right. And these things that get these small little self power devices and they last forever and it's like Dean came in and his water products, water filtration stuff. People should Google. He's a genius. No, no hit to, he already has an like this new design.

Speaker 1:          02:37:00       I wasn't going to say that. I was going to say how far are they on the island thing? That artificial island, I don't know. I think funding, they need funding to build a car so that I going to pay for that. Like pitch. Well, philanthropists, Internet age, billionaires, they'd be resources. It would have to be a lot of money. How much would it cost to build a fake islands? I have no idea. Probably a lot of fucking money, man. Probably a lot of about a lot of money. I was watching a documentary on the uh, Japanese, um, uh, airport that they had created and that is a, it's an artificial island and an artificial island they've created, but there is slowly sinking into the sea. So they have this elaborate system of lifts that as it sinks, they raise it up to keep it level.

Speaker 1:          02:37:38       It's fucking nuts to me. What a marvel of engineering, you know, what engineering is this a magnificent, when you think about it, it's, it's, it's incredible. I love looking at engineering in nature and comparing it to engineering made by man and you see how they certain patterns that that aligned and we, here we are, we're like, oh, you know, we thought of this. But then it's like, oh, but matches this pattern that nature came up with to realize is that a good idea is a good idea. Whether you came up with it blindly like nature or whether you came up with it consciously like, man, good idea's a good idea. If it works, it works. That's, that's what's amazing. Have you ever seen when they take a, a colony of leaf cutter ants and they expose their entire underground structure by filling it with cement technology, they have their own technologies yet that's their extended phenotype.

Speaker 1:          02:38:22       It's really kind of a fucking disturbing thing to watch though because it's kind of ant genocide. You're like looking at me and eventually cemented everybody in. It is very sad. I mean it's, uh, I don't really give a fuck about ants, but it's kind of crazy that they're willing to just cement the shit out of their houses just to find out how big the houses. Yeah. If you haven't seen it folks, you could just Google it. Uh, well what does it Brian Leaf cutter ants. Just pull, pull that video up because it's astounding to look at. Just pull up a leaf cutter, ant colony exposed. Um, and these, uh, these scientists say they found out that not only do they have these intricate structures, but they have events set up. So where they bring in like a funguses and things that are, that are, um, that are, that are rotting.

Speaker 1:          02:39:05       Yeah, there's an ability for the, the, the, the fucking gases to rise out through the air pollute their little tunnels. There's so much emergent intelligence in the design, but you know what the most amazing part is? There's no one in control. It's all decentralized. It's all a bunch of individual local interactions happening simultaneously that together exhibit emergent phenomenon and emergent complexity. It's like bi Pi walls, tree beehives, exhibit self, organization that emerges when all these billions of bees are working together to create an intelligent behavior. But no individual bee itself is intelligent. That's amazing. Now they're saying that our neurons are the same, that we're not like a singular consciousness, but billions of non-intelligent neurons that together create synchronous like transcendent effects. That a consciousness emerges from the interactions of trillions of neurons, individual, local relationships happening in different parts of the brain and then together make sense.

Speaker 1:          02:39:58       Our brains aren't like the vigilante. Our brains, our neurons are like the ant in the ant colony and then us is the emergent behavior. It's what comes out. Yeah. I've always said that it's ridiculous to think that human beings can ever be separate because that's the worst thing they could do to you in prison. Yeah. The worst thing they could do to you in prison as separate you from the general population and put you in solitary. Yeah. Nobody can talk to you. You're just by yourself. That's crazy for people. Yeah. Well that is cutting your arm off. Yes. It's, it's alien to our, our goal and purpose and on our desires on earth. 100% yeah. So it's obvious that we are engineered for a reason or at least for feedback. Yeah. For Interaction, interaction and feedback. Everything is feedback loops, dude. Everything. Well that's why these kind of conversations, it's so exciting.

Speaker 1:          02:40:40       Yes, exactly. Cause you, you know, you, you, you turned my brain into an area that you know, might not have gone into. Like, then we start expanding in that area. There's a book by Matt Ridley called the rational optimist and he coined the word idea sex. And he says that ideas coming together and open liquid networks, open channels of communications are akin to genetic recombination in nature. It's genes being in the primordial soup, mixing and completing each other, interacting and good. It's all a giant Al's happening with ideas. Yeah. Ideas are intermingling and having sex with one another, but they're creating more change in at a rate that is unheard of by the gene pool. If we could look at the interactions of, of, of human behavior and thought and language, if we could look at all that stuff as like numbers and, and look at it as like energy and, and, and something that can be quantified instead of looking at it as our own product.

Speaker 1:          02:41:25       Yeah. And instead of looking at it as something that we have done right, if we could just look at it entirely of its own and we will see a completely different picture away. Well if you take the long view and Caterpillar, man, we're a caterpillar about to become a butterfly. We're making some crazy fucking cocoon right now. We don't even know what we're doing, which just transform everything and we just bought, we know it's possible. Caterpillar's did it. Caterpillar's do it. So you know it exists. It does. It's not beyond the laws of physics for completely have radical self transformation. You've

Speaker 7:          02:41:53       couldn't blow my mind again man.

Speaker 1:          02:41:56       You blew everybody's mind again. This podcast, I essentially, I got to think we should stop right there cause that's about three hours. Oh well that was crazy. Wasn't it? About three hours. Somewhere in there. Yeah. Two hours, 40 minutes or something like that. Thanks again brother. Thank you man. You're very, very stimulated. Soc Two thanks. So it's one of those are you? So are you guys these conversations and it just, you know, you walk out to drive home. Just going, what the fuck man, thanks for having me, man. You're so awesome at uh, like passionately and fusing these ideas and other people's heads. Thanks brother. You know, you, you have like a, a way of uh, you know, like when you get fired up about shit, like everybody around you is like, oh yeah, yeah, yeah. Thanks man. It's infectious. Very effective. Thanks brother. And if people want to find you on Twitter, it's Jason Underscore Silva if they want to find you online.

Speaker 1:          02:42:41       It is. This is Jason silva.com and uh, all of his upcoming lectures and all. Is there anything that people can see, like there are any places where are the average person go and buy a ticket and watch you perform live. If the economist ideas festival happening in Berkeley and March 28th is on innovation and people can Google economist ideas, anyone can go to that. You can buy tickets for that and you don't have to work at Google. Yes. And a on April 20th, when I speak at the national arts club, they have a website. You should be able to look it up. But I think it's about like dreaming unlimited or something like that and then all the New York

Speaker 2:          02:43:12       City mission is on. This is Jason silva.com or tweet about it all the time as the talks come up, the PSFK conference in New York at Battery Park on March 30th you can buy tickets to, I'm going to speaking at University of Pennsylvania April 2nd actually. Beautiful Fun. This class on psychedelics and visionary arts and stuff. Keep doing what you're doing on it. Love it. It's very exciting. Thank you everybody for tuning into the podcast. Thanks for all the positive tweets and messages and w we loved you too. Thanks for everybody who already bought tickets for Atlanta April 20th it is. The first show was pretty much sold out. It will be when I record my next special, so if you want to go, there will be tickets to the second show that will be available sometime this week. Like I said, probably somewhere around Wednesday and I got a lot, a lot of other shit going on in the future to Louisville, Kentucky.

Speaker 2:          02:43:57       That's soon. What does that Brian, any ideas? Then me Vet Kentucky, the June, January, March 30th through April 1st is Louisville, Kentucky, and then, uh, we're in Hermosa beach is actually before that. March 23rd and 24th at Hermosa Beach, the comedy Magic Club, one of my favorite clubs ever. And uh, then for 20 in Atlanta for 20, is what I'm going to do. My special, it's so cliche. It's so cliche as a corny pothead, I couldn't, couldn't resist a thank you to the fleshlight for tuning in and saving our souls with their plastic vagina. Does that work? No. I need to come up with a new commercial. Thank you to the fleshlight for being there for lonely boys being easy. Thank you for being, yeah, but not that easy to clean it. A little complicated. It's, yeah, you gotta you should at the end of it should be like a garbage disposal.

Speaker 2:          02:44:44       It just eats loads and then turns it into love and sends it out to the universe. It's really easy. If you'd like to sucker. I'm come out of it. So, oh Brian. So not necessary. Jason Silvas here. He's a serious man. You don't need to do that in front of him. And you fucking freak. Thank you to [inaudible] Dot Com oh and oh yeah. Oh, uh, what did I say? A fleshlight entering the code rogue and 15% off. You already know that you heard the first half of this fucking podcast. Go to [inaudible] dot com enter into Qa rogue and save 10% there. It's over. It's done. Tomorrow we have Aubrey, Mike, Marcus, uh, formerly known as the artist, formerly known as Chris, who's our friend who changed his fucking name. That's how hard he tripped. He went to a Peru Dude Iowasca and changed his fucking name. You know, I have, I have a friend who did that to my friend the line.

Speaker 2:          02:45:30       Yeah, that Iowasca Oka fuck you up son. And Aubrey just got back from Costa Rica where he went through a series of Ibogaine experience and now his name is optimus prime. Yeah. Now he's Mr Manhattan. And uh, we'll, we'll get to meet him tomorrow and he's going to explain to us what the fuck is really going on with this crazy universe we're living. Everything that has not been covered today will be covered tomorrow.
