Speaker 1:          00:00:04       Don't forget to turn your volume off. Meow.

Speaker 2:          00:00:06       Is that meow means we're going, yes. Okay. My, my volume. Totally off.

Speaker 3:          00:00:12       Everybody settle down. Settle down.

Speaker 2:          00:00:18       There's no way to say the same shit every goddamn time and not get bored with it. I wish I had something new to say about the flashlight, but I don't, you know what it is. There are spots. What the fuck is that Brian?

Speaker 1:          00:00:31       Oh, that's somebody from sinister props. Our friend over there send us another, a thing today.

Speaker 2:          00:00:36       Wow. That is dope. And that's the same guy that made the um, exorcist one. Yep.

Speaker 1:          00:00:41       Exorcism. This one has a, this is a Zombie. Hitler. Well, Nazis, his Ma's. He's not allowed to sell it with a mustache for legal reasons. So I have to put something on there cause he can't sell dummies with the mustache. I, I'm just, I'm just joking. I don't know. It's without a mustache. He could just be a random Nazi dude. Some other scary Nazi dude. Yeah. And then he moves. He does this like creepy thing when it's hung up. Right. Where he's just like moves down.

Speaker 2:          00:01:09       Oh Wow. Like it's kind of weird. Yeah. And his eyes turn on and off. Yeah. That would be the worst. A Nazi Zombie. Like it was a cunt in life. You know, what is it going to be like in death? You know the Nazis easier. The country is humans have ever lived, right? Yeah. If someone's being a con, what do you say to him? What do you a fucking Nazi. You say that? Yeah, like that is the thing that you say when someone's just a, an utter cunt. And that along with being, the only thing that can be worse is if they were gay. Rapist zombies, right? Not just gay. Just gave rapist sons. There's nothing wrong with being gay. I mean it would probably be your best quality if you're a Zombie and a Nazi and gay. He'd be like, well gaze. The only part that, it's not even a problem, but if it was a rapist Zombie and it was gay, that would be like the worst.

Speaker 2:          00:02:03       If it was a Nazi rapists, like if it fucked you and just said horrible antisemetic shit. Well, that's why you better obey the first rule. Zombie land. What is the first rule? Zombieland cardio. Oh, that's right, that's right. That movie, you're a fatty. You're going to get hit by one of those guys first. Yeah. That was a smart movie. That was a great, that was a fun movie. That was our, like, it's, it's I, I was like, somebody told me to see and I was like, come on man, I can't see another Zombie movie. I can't, I just don't have the interest. I know whoever I'm watching the beginning is going to be there at the end. You know, they might lose a few friends along the way, blah, blah, blah. I can't watch it. They usually lose a few of the Douchey ones. Right?

Speaker 2:          00:02:40       Yeah. Get wiped out. Of course. Yeah. As soon as someone shows any unfavorable characteristics, you know, there's Zombie Bait. Yeah. But that was a great example of what is still possible with the Sharia law. No, I brought the wife to that one and she normally would never go to see that shit. And she actually at the end, it was like, that was actually not, not bad. Yeah. That was a good movie. That was fun. You know, it wasn't a good movie. Abe Lincoln, vampire hunter. Oh Jesus. Hey, you're saving the money of going, how dare you? It was fun for a little while. It was fun for like the first hour and then I was like, okay, it's getting ridiculous, man. What? They started going through history and fight for alcohol care. Come on. It's just silly. This is commercials. We haven't even gotten to the podcast.

Speaker 2:          00:03:24       Adam score. Gee, I'm really stoned. Yeah, you might be the germ Rogan experience podcast. As I was saying before, I got so rudely interrupted with my own shenanigans. Uh, w we are brought to you by the fleshlight. If you go to Joe rogan.net, click on the link for the fleshlight. Enter in the code name Brogan. He will save yourself 15% off the number one sex toy for men. Oh, people have been asking us, are we sponsored by alien? Where there was a, like a thread where people were saying that like, you know, you say you only have two sponsors, but it seems like you have three now. Alien ware Alienware is not our sponsor. Alienware hooked us up and, um, the, our sponsor is sucker punch entertainment. So the, um, the story behind it is I wanted to switch to Alienware computers because Alienware computers are, uh, they're supporting a lot of MMA fighters is a lot of guys that are getting sponsored by Alienware.

Speaker 2:          00:04:23       And I think that's awesome that a huge company like Dell has the balls to do something like that. And so, uh, I, I looked for a way to do a deal with Alienware computers, but the way we're doing it is I'm doing a deal through sucker punch entertainment. So that is the answer, that question. And it's primarily to support a company that supports MMA fighters. And I think that's a good thing for all of us. And if it takes me an extra 15 seconds on a podcast to do that, uh, I would like to do that. Cause I think it's one of the coolest things that we can do as consumers is a support companies that support, you know, the things that we enjoy, the things that we like, especially companies that take a chance on MMA, which of course is a, a very big passion of mine.

Speaker 2:          00:05:12       Um, so that's the answer to that question. We are also sponsored by on it on it.com if you go there, you can check out the new kettle bells that we have in. We just got them. They're fucking awesome. They're the best cattle. But you can buy these, your kettle bells, they're the shit. They're, they're really bad ass and they're heavy as fuck. So you have to send these things through the mail. The whole thing is up very to find process. I mean, if you can't imagine you're, you're sending cannon balls essentially cast iron cannonballs through the mail. I mean, so socks for the ups lady. I mean it's fucking, you get one of those, fill up the ass for that too. Oh yeah. Yeah. It's brutal. But you know, they're the best we can. The best we can sell. At the lowest price we can sell.

Speaker 2:          00:06:00       And um, there you get them and they last for the rest of your life. And I swear you don't need anything else to get a workout. My best workouts, I use a chin up bar and three kettle bells and that's, I don't need to do anything else. I can do everything with these fucking things. And when you, when you do kettle bells you get like a functional strength that I, I never felt that I got from regular lifting for regularly lifting. Like when you isolate things like isolate triceps and isolate biceps, a lot of times that can lead to injury, especially bicep tears happens on a lot of guys who used to do a lot of curls because you stress out the muscle from that weightlifting like that, you know, the isolating one particular body part and it's an unnatural thing to do. And then when you go in box and actually use your arms, that's where guys were blowing out their biceps tendon.

Speaker 1:          00:06:48       I hadn't done my bicep but my shoulders of Clayton, the last cause I for awhile when I was in New York and I had started my career in modeling, then went to film school and sexy bitch, you sexy bitch that dad now, but how dare you? I did a lot of just you know, training just to make the physique and then went back to boxing because I used to box and I was younger. I was like western Canadian champ when I was younger, but so now my shoulders would click right. I had to go get prolotherapy. Oh yeah. Have you heard about that? I've had that. I've had that on my wrist for your great work. Fantastic. Amazing. Yet that's considered like if you don't, yeah folks, if you don't know what it is, well is it considered a hogwash? Is that what you were saying? Well, every time I mentioned like my natural path is a good buddy of mine from high school and I'll mention him to regular doctors like, oh my natural pass said this and they like my real doctor. We'll stop. Right. And be like, you shouldn't listen to what they have to say.

Speaker 2:          00:07:37       Yeah. That is a tricky thing, right? Like doctors don't want to listen to any herbal talk. Like you show your herbs, herbal, whole natural physician or whatever the fuck you calling yourself. You know, cause it's too much of it that it's just fuckery. That's why a lot of it might only be legit. There's, there's probably a lot in herbal medicine that is legit. This is a lot of fuckery going on with that too though. No Man, they natural paths. What from our sun? It seems like it should be an honorable occupation. You know, get people to live their life in a healthy way and we'll eat healthy vitamins and take healthy nutrients. And you know,

Speaker 1:          00:08:14       that's what my buddy told me is he said, you know, when you go that way, you have to come halfway. Right. Half of it is you living right. Eating right, looking after yourself. But you know, my, my natural path also does prescriptions, right? So he's not like he's got his, you know, he's like, when you get an, when you get sick you need an antibiotic. Right. I tried to make it so your body doesn't get there. Right? Like my mind is smart. Right. Why is it seem like fuckery? Break it up.

Speaker 2:          00:08:38       I mean, I, I'm not, I'm trying so hard to not be judgmental, but when if someone says natural path, I'm like, okay, maybe he's one of the good guys, you know? I mean it's like anything else, like when you get into astrology or any, anytime you go down weird street, there's just too many people that are shitting in the alleys.

Speaker 1:          00:08:56       I'm sure a few people down weird street have a point. I'm not saying they don't, I'm definitely not saying they don't, but God damn, a lot of them seem to, yeah, you get seems to be crazy. Yeah. You get the credit and then they ruin it for all everybody else. But you had the prolo done. I mean, I had it done in my shoulder like mine were. I would just pick up a milk jug out of the fridge quick and it slipped a little bit. Right.

Speaker 2:          00:09:17       For people who don't know what prolotherapy is, if you have a ligament problems, a lot of people recommend this thing called prolotherapy, which they inject like a glucose solution directly into your ligaments and your tendons and it actually forces them to swell and grow and they strengthened by as much as 30 to 40% you know,

Speaker 1:          00:09:39       that's pretty sure that's been proven yet. I mean, and the way that it started, my uh, my natural father was telling me that the way that he got into is in the United States when you'd have to go, you get approved for insurance to go get shoulder surgery and they estimated 60 grand. They would try to put you on the prolo first. They're like, well, this is only five grand, so why don't we try the prolotherapy first? Then if that doesn't work then we'll book you in. So you said some of this, some of the, some of the mistakes, you know, in the industry can actually turn out to have positives and other ways where now that stuff, I mean, I'm not saying for everybody, there's not the way you put it. To me, that made so much sense. He said, listen at him. He was like, before you go get surgery and they hack and shop and they take stuff out that you can't get back.

Speaker 1:          00:10:19       Try my process. He's like, I've had former NHL players and stuff that have had it done. If had, you know, wicked, wicked results. If mine doesn't work, then go get your shoulder chop. Because once it, well, what exactly was wrong? What you're to out of these commercials real quick. These commercials are fucking gigantic. Is this still a commercial? What is it? Is it really a commercial? Goddammit, it's a fucking show. And in the show, this is the beginning part. Okay. And then the beginning part, we do commercials, but sometimes we talk to, it's okay. It doesn't, I like to take a serious, yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:10:50       Well this would be just the Internet's mystery. Okay. Uh, on a.com kettle bells. They're awesome. Uh, my, my point before all that was just that isolated muscle groups is kind of an unnatural thing. And the, the natural way to work out with weights is to use your whole body. And that's what the benefit of kettle bells, the exercises allow you to use, like your momentum and explosive energy. And it's like, it's all like, you know, they're like real power lifting exercises like cleans and snatches and today's I snatches. Yes, I did squats and you know, and, and, and you know, and alternating cleans is, there's so many bad ass Turkish getups are so many bad ass exercises you can do with kettlebells. And uh, go check them out there for sale on at.com. Oh, and, and it also get yourself some Alpha brain or you'll sound stupid.

Speaker 1:          00:11:38       It's my new approach. What's Alpha brain offended that you didn't give me the new Alpha Brain Joe? I thought I did. No, it, the new one has like a sticker on it that says now with something else. And I might not have that yet. Do you guys have any of that here but not in an Ami. Tried it and it's like I, some of my car

Speaker 2:          00:11:54       Brett tried it, said he loved it. Yeah. Whereas writing, yeah, he liked it. So it's legit. There's look that's very controversial. Uh, I can't talk about this any other way other than this way. So even though it sounds very repetitive, some people, this might be the first podcast they've ever heard, so please forgive me, but uh, what they are is nutrients that have been shown to have a positive effect on the, your brain's ability to produce neurotransmitters that your brain's ability to work in a smooth fashion of those. You want some gummy bears? No, those are scary as fuck. I know what those are. Those are those dangerous gummy bears. Careful out Corgi. Yeah. Don't throw those over there. If you have any questions about the nutrients or anything, the research on the nutrients, if you go to [inaudible] dot com all the information is up online.

Speaker 4:          00:13:21       Train by day. Joe Rogan podcast show

Speaker 2:          00:13:28       what's going on? People getting mad at me from my fucking commercials. What? Ben? I liked the way you do your commercials cause they actually get into the eye listening to your podcast. I'll, I'll get lost in your car. I'm like, Oh shit. They're still in a commercial. They got to bring it back yet. Not very professional, but it is what it is folks. I think it's better way to let it fucking fly. Who gives a shit? I think it's a better way of doing it. Yes, I agree. Hollow. Adam scored you ladies and gentlemen, my friend from another country. Yeah. No, I'm not too far. He's from up north. Are Our cousin to the north. Is that we are we brothers and sisters? Are we cousins? Cause that's fucked up. Who lived right next to her? We can't be brothers and sisters. I think we gotta be brothers and sisters.

Speaker 2:          00:14:10       Then you've got to let the Mexicans into that means hate me. You know what? Honestly, without skins, fuck your sister. How hard I have to work on my yard. We were all going to not trying to be, I mean how rude. How dare you suggest it. Mexicans work on Howard's men. The ones down from my parents in Texas, they do magical job and they're 40 bucks a week. Like they cut out sod and replace it like I, you couldn't get someone to do what they do for 500 bucks. A lot of fucking work, man. Being a gardener, God damn think how hard it is to be a goddamn Gardner that she has brutal. I digging ditches all day out in La. Holy Shit Man. La. Kind of a crazy place

Speaker 5:          00:14:51       to live. If you really stop and think about it. We got a lot of people here and there's no fucking water. We have to steal the water from the Colorado River and we call it the l. We would call our thing the La River. That is the most hilarious river ever. And it is like the perfect example of what's wrong with La. It's cement. The La River literally is a cement tube and they call it the La River. Like that is not a fucking river. You assholes. That's a fake river. And you know what? You guys get power from Canada actually from dams, not far from where I live. We steal it or do we buy it? No, we use by miss who? Dangerous weapons in Canada. Next thing. Who you, how do you guys make the power through big hydroelectric dams on in the mountains. Wow. So then you sell it to the United States.

Speaker 5:          00:15:40       What parts of the United States? California is wine, and we brought it up in a union member like mayor mayor of Vancouver, Larry Campbell. He says, he's like, I don't think the trades would stop. He's like, do you want la in the dark and thirsty because we ship water to right. Wow. So that's incredible. So the dams make so much electricity that you can power La. Yeah, the world. I don't think it powers the whole, I don't even know how they ship it or how it works, but we sell it to even understand electricity. Yeah. I under, no, I don't. I do know that it's, I don't, I have no idea how they save in some mind. Fuck. Our fucking houses are at every moment electrocuted. There's fucking cords and if you lik dumb, your head would explode. All right? It's just shooting the shit that powers up TVs and air conditioning and you didn't even think about it.

Speaker 5:          00:16:31       You just plug in your, plug it into the nuttiest fucking thing you could ever possibly imagine. There's some sort of an electrical pulse and electrical field and electrical. There's a wire and it's connected somehow down the river to sell fucking nuclear explosion. Yeah. It's 12 fucking nuclear power plant and it's in your house. There's a direct line from that thing down into some fucking son in the middle of downtown San Diego. Wherever the fuck that power plan is now, you always get people thinking deep too. That's a terrifying thought. Well, that's, I was trying to think how do they ship it? Like how do you store it? Do you put it in a can obviously has to come through a line and then goes into it. I didn't even understand it a little tiny bit. There was a crow in the Starbucks of the day in line and uh, you know, um, I was getting my coffee and she was talking to her boyfriend and she was like, what if it was fucking total chaos?

Speaker 5:          00:17:28       Like if the power never came back on. And I was like, wow, isn't that incredible? That what we think of is total chaos is the grid that if we lost this crazy thing that we've constructed, there's no way we could live without it. That's a weird fucking combination of human and machine and technology and relying on at all all the time and just being terrified of the idea of being forced to live off the land. Use tools, catch your food. You know what I'm saying? You said it is skynet. Isn't that crazy? What a weird thing that we've become that we haven't even noticed. It sort of snuck up on us and we became like a hybrid. We're like park people and fucking part technology. We're constantly on the tit of technology all day. Paul Day. Oh Fuck Day.

Speaker 1:          00:18:25       How do you do with your Joe? You're pretty good with your Twitter. Getting back to everybody. I mean, I can't get back to everybody. It's impossible. I mean, I would get nothing done if I did, I would like, you know what I mean? I mean, I try to, I get back to people occasionally, but I don't, I can't commit to doing it to everybody. It's a system, but I think you do a pretty good job. Like, you know, I'm always able to hit you up there and you get back to me and you, I think you do a pretty good job, man. I mean, I'm looking at mine. I only have like 11,000 followers and I'm finding it hard to just try to be, it can get pretty nutty one. How? Dude Luck Justin Timberlake rocks. It doesn't even have, I think they just have guys running. Oh, that's so sad.

Speaker 1:          00:19:01       That's what I don't like. People like that. That just seems like it's their generic tweet where they're like, my show is here. I'm playing here. Tickets at like, there's none of them just saying, Oh shit. I just saw the craze. Like you're like, okay, let's just someone running it on a generic program anymore. They just give it the handed over to the publicist. Some people do. Yeah. That's unfortunate. You know, cause I like, like Kevin Smith's tweets. I know Kevin Smith's writing those tweets. You know what I mean? Like a Jim Norton. I love Jim Norton's tweets, so I know he's writing them. No. And that same I, I'd stopped following the people that I don't think's writing. And when it's just these great quotes all the time and stuff like will Smith's or quotes every day. And I'm like, okay. I like, that's I think Joel, I think that's what I was talking to Brian earlier, like the community you guys built is because you guys are like interactive way and you do do it yourself. You're not having a publicists like checking everything you tweet and saying shouldn't do this and shouldn't and doing it for you. But we should all totally have. It's really done that.

Speaker 1:          00:20:01       Brian wants an intervention. Someone saved me from myself. Well maybe I missed it, but you haven't done a tweet. That's so bad. No, look, we're nice people. I'm fast deleting the, but the bottom line is if we're nice people, you gotta be a nice person, man. It's like, you know, life can throw you some, some situations that could go one way if you choose to be a nice person or

Speaker 5:          00:20:26       it could go horribly wrong if you choose to be a Douche bag or choose to, you know, be weird about it or not be considered about another person's feelings. You know, it's real. It's a, these little like moments where we like decide who we are. Like it, it happens and you know, you can go down the wrong road. It doesn't mean you're a bad person, you know, like made a mistake. You might have overreacted, you might've been stressed out about something. That doesn't mean you still can't be a good person and he's just got to reset and realize you're not the past. Okay. You're not all your fuck ups. You're what you've learned. You're now, you're, you're, you're the you now that gets it some move forward, move forward and let that shit go. Well, I have to, you know, bring it up for the people listening, Joe.

Speaker 5:          00:21:08       I mean like how cool you were when we first came to do the union, right? Todd called you. We needed someone that we knew we needed someone that knew the subject matter, that was a celebrity punch. And you know, three guys from Canada, you said, yeah, no problem. We come to your house. I've been, it's still, if you were like, what was the first time you met? Joe was like, we came to the house and he's like, how long has set up the lighting? And we're like, Oh, 20 minutes. He's like, oh, the kitchen's over there and I'll be right back. I'm just going on my computer. Then I was like, man, we're just three random guys from Canada and your Todd Todd is a very good friend and uh, you know, he's, uh, he's done a lot for the whole, uh, legalization process and the, Oh, I shouldn't even say that.

Speaker 5:          00:21:43       I should say the awareness process. You know, he's got a great book on how to grow hemp. He's a brilliant guy when it comes to the history of it and it's helped him personally through cancer. So He's, he's very passionate about it. So when he brought it up to me, I was just like, okay, let's do it. It was awesome man. Cause I mean you're the number one asked for guy to interview for the next one. Like that's how everyone's like Joe, Joe, Joe, Joe, Joe was like, oh that's cool. I was like, I'll talk to him. I was like, they're like you've got to have a muse. And I mean Joe, I mean I had to watch the film 1000 times, but when I'd go to sold out theaters and every time you think like I could count, we knew the spots where people are laughing like okay cheeseburger thing coming up here.

Speaker 5:          00:22:25       Let's Nerf the world. And I just literally go up some of my watching cloud, the laugh now. And they do it every time man. It was to see that reaction I think. And, and when we did the union, it came out, I don't think a lot of people had seen you in that context. They knew as a UFC guy, not a lot of people need from news radio unless they were a die hard fan. And then they need from fear factor. Right. So they didn't see it. Like, cause I remember a lot of people are in like fear factor guy smokes weed. Like they were so shocked when you said that in the opening part. We have you saying like I realized when I was 30 years old that I'd be fucking trek. You gotta be fucking kidding me. Well that's really what it is.

Speaker 5:          00:22:59       Um, I was just being honest about it, you know, I didn't think it was, uh, I, I didn't think doing it was, uh, anything other than what I had to do. You know, I think, I think you have to, when you know something about something, like when you have an experience, especially in experience about something that has such a tainted name, like marijuana, you know, he just like, oh, Meryl Won. What if, what is he a loser? Just lists, lists and no spine and no motivation. It's just got this terrible connotation and connection to it. And I bought it hook, line and sinker until I was 30 years old. And, uh, Eddie Bravo got me high. Yeah, I remember what you brought Eddie over that day. The first time we met. But I mean I was the same way when we did the union. I think that's why the union turned out so

Speaker 6:          00:23:46       good is that we weren't activists or anything in the beginning. We just, you weren't a pot smoker it on. That's what I tell people. They're like, oh, what does he like? Is he a stoner? No. Easy like clean cut and Kirk Looking Barbie motherfucker. Martin, what's his name? Ken. Thanks. I'll tell you. Why am I saying Kirk? Kirk? Kirk, I don't know how you got Kurt is there's been a black Barbie guy. Yeah. Should be. What the fuck man? It has her. They're scared. So scared. So scared of a black man has to. I bet they're probably have. I mean there's a bar. There must be. He's got a, Ken must have a friend. I bet he has a really white features though. Let's see what his features look like. Let's see if there's any black men. I think I remember some of the Black Barbie friends, but I mean there wasn't my toy by Black Barbie thing.

Speaker 6:          00:24:36       Must have blackboard that they do and it's not as, it looks pretty crazy. How does that work? That's pretty cool. That's like Tyrese. No. Or Tyson Beckford. Yeah, that's a handsome black look. You just got to accept that that girl meets that guy. He's going to fuck her representative in doll form of what would really happen. Yeah. Look at his body. He's a super athlete and wonder if the white has got a body like that. Put pull up a white Ken. See if they only came the black eye. A body like that because that would be hilarious because if that was a human being, I think that one's just a spoof one that someone may stop. Stop fucking with you. That's a title. That's a Dyson cinnamon. I, I apologize. I've been trolled. He got Brian. That was pretty good. Son of a bitch.

Speaker 6:          00:25:36       Are Boys supposed to have the Kendall? Is that what what it is? Or a girls by the boy? No, boy. I thought they tried to sell it as that, but I don't think you'd ever think it was. I think I would think I'd never was four guys at all. Oh a few dudes wants to bought it and been like, what the fuck did I do? I did GI Joe fucking Barbie. I was going to say, am I the only guy that every time I go over to my cousin's and there'd be Barbie and Ken, I'd strip them down and put them in a sexual position when I was like seven. So you only new missionary, right? It just always be guy on top. But yeah, Barbie Ken, I would buy like like hulk dolls and shit like that. Why is that an, because it's 10 it's the hall you and saw vendors over was event. If you had a Ken doll, it'd be like that's how you get into the Barbie party. Like if all those little girls are hanging out and partying, do you want to party with them? You got to get a Ken doll. It's like your car and I definitely go for getting into the little girl party. I would have tried more of the approach of just hulk smash his way in there. And you can't do that when you're 12 man, that's a, I just don't think I would have been that slick actually about the

Speaker 2:          00:26:44       the hook line to get into the place. That's ridiculous. Cause 12 year old boys are not playing Barbie. I wouldn't have, I wouldn't have been that slick. Right. Like they usually still insult each. Is that when they like each other at that age. Yeah, but I'm just saying 12 years old is way too old. Like they gave up on Barbie when I think kids give up on Barbie real early. I think we now hold, especially now with technology. I mean so any boy who buys a Barbie doll is probably just being tricked. If he buys a Ken doll, he's been tricked by my thing. He's only been tracked because marketers have gotten, that's what it is. I mean I collected Gi Joes, masters, all those. I had all the marvel superheroes. I had all of them too. I was a big Wolverine Junkie. I had his first 50 comics and men are dorks somewhere along the line though.

Speaker 2:          00:27:29       You feel real guilty about that? Like I got rid of my comic book collection when I was poor and I needed money. I sold my entire comic book collection. It was just one of those desperation. I need food moves and uh, I, I've, there was a part of me that was like, this is good because you really have to grow up. Like, what are you doing reading comic books? You're in your twenties now and you have to, you know, you're, you're, you're struggling out here. You can barely feed yourself your role in nickels to eat, you know, like finding change in your house, get the, get rid of the comic book pitch. Then once I got rid of him, like, man, did you guys ever experimented with a visionaries? Excuse me, this toy, it was like right after Gi Joe and they, they were like a beefier Gi Joe, but they had like holograms all over him, like a hologram up a wolf and it looked like I only went once they stopped and Gi Joes, I was pissed.

Speaker 2:          00:28:22       I was about when I grew out of it and it was just video games after that and in sports, I was a huge comic book fan for a long time when I wanted to be a comic book illustrator at one point. So I was always like, yeah, yeah, yeah I could. I used to draw a real good when I was young. Um, but I had a really douchey high school art teacher that kind of turned me off. He was like, he kept emphasizing that yet, well you're, you're gonna if you want to be an illustrator, you're going to have to draw things. You don't want to draw. Okay, you're going to have to draw diaper ads. And he's like, diaper ads was like the one thing that he kept bringing it up. Like you're a professional artists. You, he might have to work and do a diaper, add a, I was like, this guy is just so negative.

Speaker 2:          00:29:01       Like fuck artists, you know, it was just, he was a really, really dour dude. It sucks when you had those kinds of teachers in high school, whether it's art class or whatever that you look back now and realize how they really shouldn't have been there and didn't put in the time. And then he was gross man. Like even if you drew like what? Like your interpretation of something, like a weird sort of interpretation of something. He would be like, if they want you to draw something for an advertisement, you draw what they ask you to draw. I'm like, dude, you're gross. This is gross. You're like, you're, you're putting this weird fucking spin on what is and isn't cool to dry. I like comic bitch

Speaker 5:          00:29:42       and they're telling me there's something wrong with that. Look, she hadn't looked at comic industry like, Oh, they're all transferring video game industry, which is huge. So those people that were telling them not to do that silly bitches stupid. But then you get that, you get that like one good teacher that actually takes a little bit of time and gives you an, you're like, whoa. Like I can learn so much when I just get that little bit of respect. I remember I had an English teacher and it wasn't, it was in like the 10th grade and I didn't know how to write essays properly because I didn't pay attention to my other classes and instead of just giving me c minus or d, She came up to me after class. She's like, Adam's, anyone ever told you that you write like your opening statement? Then your argument of like how to do it.

Speaker 5:          00:30:18       And I was like, no. And she's like, oh my God. Right. She's like, okay, well I'll help you with that. And then I'd like, but I thought that was so simple. That was the first teacher just asked like instead of just give me a flunking grades and be like, do you know how to do this? Yeah. I had a really, really cool English teacher though. Everybody tried to get into her class when they got in their class, they was psyched because she was really generous with the grades, but she was just the sweetest, nicest lady. And when you would go into her class, it would be a completely different vibe than all the other classes. Everybody was happy. They were all relaxed because there was no like authoritarian. But she was such a nice person. He would never want to get her upset with you.

Speaker 5:          00:30:58       Like if if she like had to quiet you down because you were talking in the back of the room. Somebody that you would feel genuinely bad like you know you'd apologize because she was a sweet, sweet person. She was so inspirational. There's One lady teacher and I had one Spanish teacher that was a bad motherfucker as well but right. He was like he, he wasn't letting it. I think he was a fairly young guy and he was handsome and like the girls were like all over him man. And the dude like I know we had a dodge like a lot of 17 year old girls cause cause he was a really handsome guy. I don't think he was any older than like 23 or 24 it was a scary situation. Interesting man. Because he was not much older than us. I remember that feeling like he was so much closer to us than all these other teachers.

Speaker 5:          00:31:47       Like the math teacher was like in her fifties and if this guy was still alive, I'm still pulses. All the rest of their dead dude. There were some dead people teaching high school. Man. I know we had some, I mean I wasn't, I wasn't the greatest in high school. Uh, it's just, it's hard. It's doesn't pay well that their kids aren't behaved. The kids are like me. I wasn't, I wasn't not behaved. I was an idiot. Oh, I was too. And I mean I used to get in fights all the time because I was insecure and so I was always getting in trouble for that. But I'll tell you that like teachers would, they told me later on is that they used to hear so many bad things about me in the staff room that they were terrified to have me in their class. But the teachers that were cool, like I never ever, like you said, like if I had a teacher that showed me respect from the beginning, like if she asked me, I would feel guilty like you said. Or he like, I be like, oh, I let them down because this guy like treats me like he's really teaching me and he treats me as an adult. Right. And is trying to get to instead

Speaker 1:          00:32:40       of like you said, like coming in like a dictator and slashing you down. Like a never responded well with those teachers, you know, I don't like anybody that to Douche bag. I don't want to be them when I grow up, you know? That's how I would feel. I would be in their class. I'd be like, shut down, boom. It's not paying attention. Barely squeaked through. That was my strategy for mine too. I barely, it was funny cause one of the teachers, my buddy works at a bank and they're getting a loan and she brought up, she's like, where's that Adam's Gorgie kid? Is he in jail or is he with the bikers now? And then my buddies like, no, actually he's uh, going to be on TV this week. And he's in and they're like, what? And even her husband grabbed her. It's kind of like, yeah, he's, he's doing well and she's so people thought you were going to grow up to be a psycho?

Speaker 1:          00:33:26       Yeah, cause I mean, I grew up in a different, like, I mean my, my dad owned a strip club when I was going through high school and just after high school, while I was up nightclub first and a strip club. And then that was the madness that I inherited when he passed away in 2003 Jesus, that's when we did. Yeah. So, and I had been away. And how old were you? I was 23 Jesus Christ. And you have to take over this crazy strip club in Vancouver. Is that where no. Colona Colona. Yeah. And it was, I mean that was biker gangs rolling through there and shit. Oh, well you see most of the agencies that send the girls and BC are owned by EMC clubs. Holy Shit. Right. So my dad had worked in, yeah, when I took over it was, we've been trying to put together a screenplay for years.

Speaker 1:          00:34:12       It was, it was, you know, 23 years old. I'm thrown into this. I was living in New York for four years, came back, hadn't been in that environment forever. What is that environment like? Like it's Vancouver just have a lot of motorcycle gangs. Is that like a real, they're the number one. There's an article in the Mcclain's at the Ha were it, it was his rich and powerful and BC some of the richest out of they. There's not, they don't have as many rivals. It's smaller. I mean there's more people in the state of California then the entire country of Canada. Right. It's just smaller. So there's less competition and they are the number one. Wow. So that's like the organized sort of situation up there. How dangerous is it? Well, I mean I know some of them like you know that I went growing up through the bar that I knew that are great and you know, I'm friends with them.

Speaker 1:          00:34:58       I, I said is it accepted part of the culture of super accepted. Like actually when you look at them as a young guy and you're like, oh my God. Like when they say crime doesn't pay, and you see these guys that are well built in shape, beautiful girlfriends, they have $60,000 Harley, $6,000 boats. They're in their 20s and you're like, damn right. Like they're the Rock Stars of Colona. Like when you, when you go to my hometown, it's like, that's, that's the guys, I mean like they'll have a boatload of beautiful women. And is it possible to get in trouble for talking about this? Like if you, you're, you're talking about that, you know, that's why I said the actual name. Yeah. Yeah. He can't say to you guys, it's like a, it's like when Vegas ran the mob. Yeah. Or was it rather the, uh, the mob Ran Vegas?

Speaker 1:          00:35:42       Yeah. I mean, they're big part of, I mean there's, there in Colona where I live, there's 150,000 people and there's three MC clubs. Now. Do they have like shootouts and shit? Are they genuinely get along or all wheeze? Just bcs had a lot of shootings in general with the drug trade coming up right now. There's been, she's been all couldn't be avoided. You saw that? Uh, I mean I think it made national news where there was that shooting downtown Vancouver and the hotel and there was like a women's national soccer team staying amps. It was broad daylight raid in the restaurant, five star, four star hotel rate in the lobby, man makeovers getting back. Is it about, of course it's all the drug trade hits. They put a hit on somebody or something. Something to do with that. Yeah. It was so scary, man. That's a scary culture to be criss crossing with, you know, and, and your d and then you put booze in that mix and you're running and you're dealing with this ticking time bomb.

Speaker 1:          00:36:35       Right. That's just, it, it, it was a real task. I mean, my, my wife and with now, I mean she's stuck there with me and helped me through, you know, all of those headaches when we were going through the place. And, I mean all this happened, like I had a bat, I did a bad deal with a childhood friend on the club, so I didn't get paid 23 and all of a sudden you've taken over this crazy little situation, sharks just everywhere. Right. And even some that don't, they don't realize they're going to be a shark. Some friends that because of the club and what that kind of brought for them, they were like, Oh Adam, you should never sell. It's your dad's legacy. And you know, cause I want to just go back to New York and continue with my film career. Right? Like I wanted, I had already was starting to do well there and I wanted nothing.

Speaker 1:          00:37:15       And then I'd be like, oh it's tell him. Then I get convinced to stay, keep it. Cause my dad left it, but, and so the end of the day I didn't get half of what I was supposed to get out of it. And I was shooting the union. I was planning on using the rest of that to finish. So I had to go back to my stepfather like two or three more times to get the financing we needed to finish and it was, you know, my first film. So people are starting to think I'm kind of crazy like they astronaut farmer, right? Like you've been working on this film for a year and a half. You've sunk everything into it. You sold your house to make this film. Like it was a really well done movie. You did a really good job of editing it. It was very entertaining.

Speaker 1:          00:37:52       It's like I've seen a bunch of cannabis documentaries and I think yours is the best. I really do. It's, it's a really well done piece and show you showed so many points and so many sides of it that are just irrefutable and it's all just laid out there and people can choose to make their own decisions of what they should and shouldn't do with their body. But if you think that that cannabis should be illegal, you're insane. You're compliance. How bout, how bout that? Like the film was done so well in parliaments eyes. I just got invited to Parliament Hill and Canada. That's Canada's White House. For those who out there, don't know. I got invited by the Liberals to help show the other mps the pros and cons of cannabis prohibition with the, they heard in the war, the, the way it happened is Aaron Kotler, who is the former to Irwin Cotler, former attorney general of Canada under John Crutches.

Speaker 1:          00:38:43       He had originally looked to put a decriminalization bill in when crutching was ending his term. Um, but then it didn't go through and his son are in color. Son was actually like really pissed off and it was like, man, I can't believe you do that. It gets kids addicted. What are you thinking about? So then when it came up recently that they're now the liberals and Canada, we're looking at putting what they call the most comprehensive legalization bill that's been tried to be passed in Canada. They, his, his dad mentioned this in an interview in a son called in and was like that, you know, and he's like, hey, why'd you say that? I was so against it. And he's like, well, that's what you told me last time. He's like, no, I watched this movie called the Union. I've totally changed my perspective and I want you and mum to see it.

Speaker 1:          00:39:20       So these nps kept hearing about it and they kept getting letters from people saying like from this and you should watch it, you said. So they sent me an email and say, hey, can you come out? I thought it was getting punked at first. Like, so think about the top of my head been, could you see that happening here in the u s Oh, the White House would like to this, this fucking corrupt cunt farm. Well that's like, there's pictures of me and Brett and we're both just standing there going like really? Like you really invited us here. That's incredible. Yeah, it's, what was it like? We're in this all oh, dress like, oh, I put on a suit. I want to, you know, I went to go be professional and brightness, full business attire, suit. I've got some pictures, uh, Brian if you want to pull them up.

Speaker 1:          00:40:00       But it's like me sitting with the em, they did a cool way of doing a screening is they had a square table and they had TVs on the inside. They were like this. So no matter what side you sat on, you could see them. And then on the tables there's also the big screen. So everybody's sitting there with their mix and they can all look like they're sitting in the thing looking forward. And then what about the Bolo tie? That shit's ridiculous. Which one's a Bolo. Bolo tie. That little string tie that oh no, no, not for a while. They tried to remember that the Polo, they tried to try to pass it off as a tie though. Yeah, it's a bolo tie. Like you can even sneak it in a lot of restaurants that you're supposed to have a tie on with a Bolo.

Speaker 1:          00:40:37       Brett Brett got nailed at the Parliament Hill restaurant cause we went to go there and he just wears a dress shirt and like dress pants. But they're like, oh no tie. So they had this drawer and I swear they got the ugliest highs ever made just to be like, don't you ever forget your tie when you come in here. They were hideous, silly. Come on. How silly is it to say to someone you're not done. You don't have your full outfit on. You don't have your full outfit. You have a shirt, you have a jacket. No, he didn't have the jacket. No, he just had the dress shirt and like just a dress shirt and dress pants. I came in the full suits. Not Enough. That's not enough to have this extra thing, this extra piece of cloth. So I know that you're a gentleman because only a gentleman wears his extra formal piece of cloth. Man, I don't expect you with your tie clip to be calling anybody a cunt or telling people to go fuck themselves. You know what I'm saying? That's when they know they can trust

Speaker 5:          00:41:34       you. There's a lot of stuff when you go in there and you're looking at like the old chairs that they sit in where the queen, if she comes in and he kind of look at all this and like really? Does that matter? Like, well, what about in the olden days when they wore those crazy wigs? I think in Canada things, powdered wigs. What was that about? Like when they were in court and shit, they were crazy. Wigs sexy. When you really think of that, it's like how much it must've sucked dick to live. Back then it might've been cool to have wigs on fuck outta here to live. It's hot ass holes with wigs on are deciding your future and fucking knock and sticks on the ground.

Speaker 5:          00:42:15       Everyone would look so weird and mysterious. He die of the flu. How about that? Yeah, but is log out much better now? Like maybe there's not the show, but I mean it's a game when you get home and certainly a game lost confusing man. It's like God, who is this benefiting the half? So God damn many of them. Even lawyers. I mean folks, let's just, we need balance. We need balance. We can't, it can't have people just struggling to try to soupy. But we needed some balance in this. Well that, that was the other thing is after I had dealt with all this shit with my dad's club and took over, then my half sister sued me for the estate because my dad had left. Everything's, when shit gets crafty. I couldn't even believe, you know, go on that end. Like we hadn't talked in years and I had, you know, really reached out and I bought her a car and done things to try like, oh, you know, maybe out of this tragedy we can build a relationship.

Speaker 5:          00:43:00       And all, man, it just went 40 wanted people were, you know, people look at other people sometimes like a lottery, you know, just, they don't, they don't think they're ever going to be able to make money on their own. And this is a certain amount of people and they have this sort of like, it's almost like a victim's rights mentality that life is a fuck them so hard that though they're going to, they're going to go after you Ken. Man, I felt, oh I felt that in the, in the, in the club scene he just put out a lot thought into your health and breaks, know very specific things. Is that what you felt like? Well how a sumptuous of me, sorry. No, no, because when, when I had the club, there's a lot of people, you know, when I was running it that felt that, well if you could fuck the customer, good for us, right.

Speaker 5:          00:43:44       We're making money and I'm just like, man, that's a bad Karma situation, man. You can, you can. I've met people that are real nice people. Like how about Bob, the owner of the Ice House. Perfect example, right? Super Nice, Super Nice person owns this club. It's so he's putting out good Karma, you know, real nice to people. Always very friendly, very generous guy. Just a cool guy. So in and out of that comes, comes good. You know, you control your environment, you know totally what that was when, you know, when my dad ran the club, it did well because my dad was the owner. There'd be out there shaking everybody's hand and he was like, he had resentment. No, there's an energy you don't over. Well here's what is there is a ton of cocaine being sold all through my place. So when I took over, you know I

Speaker 1:          00:44:32       eyes had been, you know, people are turning a blind eye for awhile. I did. I look like the King Pin. Right. Everybody's working their move in and hey, I know people did what they have to do to do in the club. So I said that stops in the club and then all my staff, all my staff laughs. Oh Shit. Cocaine operation. No it, yeah. Wow. I heard it from, I mean you inherited a cocaine operation. Oh yeah. I inherited a mess dated 2123 and I was producing the union. My first film, like that was my only chance to get out of the hole. How old were you when I'm at IU? I was 24 or 25 25 well for Todd to have that much faith in you guys, it showed, it showed, well it showed, you know once I met you, but it certainly showed with your final work where, where his head was at.

Speaker 1:          00:45:21       Cause it's, it's really good man. It's very, very entertaining. No moves. Well well if we, I always said if people could see the story of what it took to put that together, that would be a more entertaining doc. Nah, maybe just to you making, if you're fucking movie cause be as entertaining as the reason why pot is illegal. No way dude. Get serious. It might be to you. Well No. Well that's why we're, it might be like a wedding video. It's something that's awesome to you but nobody else wants. It's definitely not man. It's, it's, it's an honor to see the impact it's had. Like it, I mean my Stepdad was the one that lent me the money to do it and for me it was really cool. One day we were down at pf Chang's in Houston and we were eating and I had my union shirt on in this though.

Speaker 1:          00:46:07       The waiter comes over and he's like, man, that movie is fucking awesome. He's like, I Netflix that. I got 10 friends coming over, I'm going to show it to all them like and I was like, oh cool, thanks. And cause I had my hat and glass and he was like thanks. Then he's like, wait, he's, he get a fucking guy. That's it. Like you do wasn't swearing but he's like you're the guy. Oh so he thought he was just saying it was cool. Yeah cause he saw the logo right on my shirt and then you know, I'd had that before and it was really, it's always flattering. I, I can't believe anybody, you know, knows my work that well. But then for my dad to see, right. Cause he took this huge gamble on us. Right. Give us $200,000 cap. My God, he did. Holy Shit.

Speaker 1:          00:46:40       Brought 200 grand from your dad to go shoot it. Whew. That's some pressure son on. I had to go back two or three times because when I got screwed over at the club, I was anticipating to have money from that that I didn't get. And now the film was the only thing I could use to pay back. Like I'm like, well, if I'm ever going to pay him back, I have to get the film finished. Otherwise I'll never get out of it. So I had to keep going back and back and only now, recently. That's why it's funny some people, but that's really, how much have you made off the union? I was like, I still owe my family some money. Do you really? Yeah. Wow. That's, so that movie's still hasn't gotten to the black. Well it did. The distributors made money. Right. But you know, they, there's the marketing shipping and then it's at the end of the day, we have not seen any, like I've been able to pay off my dad a majority of his stuff. Thank God. Right in. There's still residual checks coming. They're pretty small,

Speaker 5:          00:47:30       but it's, it didn't make like, it didn't do millions of dollars or you know, these numbers that some people might think, I think a lot of people might have stole your shit online if we got a quarter for every like pirate bay and stuff we did in the green. Yeah. You know, it's funny because people go, yeah, well you know, he's not losing any money because I wasn't going to download. I mean I wasn't going to buy it anyway, so I would have never bought it. So it's not like he's losing any money, but it was okay. I know it's, it's, it's tricky. It's tricky. But then at the same time, you know, a lot of people did see it because that the viral, like Facebook and social media is the main, cause we had no money for marketing. Yes. That's what made it go 100% super viral.

Speaker 5:          00:48:11       So for a first film that was, you know, it to get the exposure is great and we weren't that, you know, as long as we could pay our families off where we're happy with seeing a bunch of memes from that documentary. Oh now like those Internet memes where he quotes somebody and there's a photo of them. Oh there's tons and there's tons of where they've just cut your clips where it's just the Joe Rogan clips from the union and then it's like quotes, like they'll have pictures of you that it'll say like let's nerf the world and all your caught me and my most indignant moment too, because when, when we did that, it was when I really had just started smoking on a reg. What year? What did we do this 2005 we would have interviewed you. So I had only been smoking for like five years.

Speaker 5:          00:48:53       So I was, I was, I was like gearing up with like my frustration with the whole situation. It was like, it was really like you caught it at the exact right time where I was having these conversations with people where they would say there's something wrong with pot and this and that. I don't think it should be legal. I'm like, what are you even yapping about? Like what are you talking about? You saying that it should be illegal to have a beer because do you know how that worked out? Did you ever hear about that prohibition thing? I went fucking crazy and organized crime got a foothold in our society and I go, and guess what? That's exactly what's going on right now. It's exact same thing. It's just with marijuana and it's with a bunch of other different substances that are somehow or another still getting sold everywhere all the time.

Speaker 5:          00:49:34       They're going to legalize everything. It's, it's, it's crazy. That's, you can't eat. You can't, I mean, you got to let people know exactly what everything does to you. You got to take a massive amount of taxes from the sale of anything, whether it's marijuana or whether it's, you know, I don't know if you should be able to sell the hard shit, you know, but I think you should be able to sell mushrooms. I don't think you should be able to sell like dangerous narcotics that we know are devastating to actual life and towards society. But if you can prove that something has a history of human use, like mushrooms, and you can prove this is a massive amount of anecdotal evidence, people have like changed their lives. John Hopkins University had this longterm study. People did one mushroom trip and 20 years later, they're, they're fucking still like they're a better person because of the experience.

Speaker 5:          00:50:24       It's like that kind of shit. You hear those kinds of stories over and over and over and over again, and you're not. No one's dying. So you feel like it. It's okay for this. In this instance, the argument's ridiculous. It's ridiculous that you would try to make this obviously massively beneficial thing illegal. There's gotta be something going on. Oh, you gotta, you gotta see what we have in store for the next one. Brett wants take it to a whole new level. It's talking about some of the think tanks of like why we get into this. Like are we least effective when caught up in group mentality. Right. Because even when we were in Parliament Hill, we're talking to some of the guys there and like, like Brett was asking some questions, key questions. Like he's like, you know, cause they said they had to put a bill through the day before and it was a thousand pages and he was like, how often is it that sometimes things just get missed and they get passed and the guy was like more often than you'd think.

Speaker 5:          00:51:09       Well I'll just, because people don't want to read like it's at the end of the week and they're like, oh there's a thousand page bill that you want to read. You go and you go through it. And then that's the stuff where the smear campaigns come up years later. Right. And they're like, he signed this thing 10 years ago and he was working for like, whether it's the conservatives and they were like, okay, we're all signing and like, like he's going to go home and after all the work he's done, 16 hour day at the hill, go home and read a thousand page. Boring is language ever too, right? Like not, we're not talking to any God and then try to make sure that you understand every line before you put your signature on it. It's really a thousand pages. That was the one that had just been passed. Yeah. How many days did this guy have to work on that?

Speaker 5:          00:51:46       Like they'd have, they'd have a decision at the end of the week. He was saying like, and then they have a four hour vote. Like it had been worked on for a long time, but by the time it got to that stage and it's like they, so did they have to read the whole 1000 well that said a lot of the times it depends on who's dealing with it, but who would ever expect someone to be able to do this? That's what I was looking like. It just, the workload they have, like they were, we were leaving at six and they were going into a four hour vote for that. And I was just like, oh my God. I was like, I couldn't shit. And they almost like we went to look through and the, and the guy's like, oh, if you come through here, you have to stay through the whole thing.

Speaker 5:          00:52:21       So if you come past this point, then you cannot leave because it's in session. I was like, well, I'm not going near there. Four hours, Jesus Christ die. That will be the, wow. Did you see that recent video of the woman from the DEA fielding questions about, from posted on the gentleman from Colorado who was, uh, asking, uh, if marijuana was less dangerous than heroin and she's her bad and she wouldn't respond, she was just like, well, we feel that all illegal drugs are bad. It was, have you seen it Brian? Oh my God. Pull it up because it's, it's preposterous what we move. What would you Google? What would be the word? I'd just put DEA, DEA agent. I'm stumped marijuana. It was a lady with particularly sad eyes. She really did. And she had particularly sad eyes like I didn't, I don't think there's any joy in that job.

Speaker 5:          00:53:22       And you, when you know that you're just, all you're doing is trying to keep people from smoking pot because that's what they're telling you to do. And there's no joy in that man. That lady had no joy in her art. We'll look at, even though it wasn't eat bleach as members of the team, she's just doing her job. That's it. Yeah, that's her. Yeah. I just hold up, but just check by the dopey i's a hilariously enough. What does this gentleman's name? Cause he's a bad motherfucker. Re w what is his name then? Marijuana. He's from Colorado. Let's give him props.

Speaker 7:          00:53:48       All illegal drugs are, is methamphetamine worse for somebody's health and marijuana? I don't think any illegal drugs. Heroin, a worse, uh, for someone's health than marijuana.

Speaker 7:          00:54:04       Again, all, I mean, I know that you can look this up. You should know this is the chief administrator for the Drug Enforcement Agency. I'm asking you a very straight forward question. Is Heroin, Jared Polis, mother Fucker, marijuana. We got to look at getting him for the culture. Drugs are, are bad. Just mean you don't know. Heroin causes an addiction. Okay. It causes, uh, causes many problems is very hard to, uh, to what does that mean? That the health impact of heroin is worse than marijuana? Is that what you're telling me? I think, I think you're asking is the objective question. No, it's objective. Uh, just looking at the science, this is your area of expertise. I'm a lay person, but I've read, read some of the home aware of it. I'm just asking you as an expert in the subject area, is heroin worse for someone's health and marijuana? You know, I'm answering as a police officer and as a DEA agent that these drugs are illegal because they are dangerous because they are addictive because they, they do hurt a person's house. So heroin is more addictive than marijuana. Heroin, more dick of the marijuana. I your experience generally the properties of heroin. Yes. It's more addictive. It's methamphetamine. More addictive than marijuana.

Speaker 3:          00:55:19       Okay.

Speaker 7:          00:55:19       Well, both are addictive ways. Is Methamphetamine more highly addictive than marijuana. I think some people become addicted to marijuana and some people become addicted to methamphetamine. You mentioned that the top, and uh, your top priority, I believe you indicated to us is abuse of prescription drugs is one of the main classifications of prescription drugs, painkillers that you're concerned about. That's correct. And are those painkillers a addictive? Yes, they are very addictive. Uh, are those painkillers more addictive than marijuana? All illegal drugs are in schedule one or addictive.

Speaker 5:          00:56:04       Oh my God. It's amazing that that person in charge of anything that has anything to do with the legality of marijuana. Well, see that's where we want to show in the culture. High ride is there seems to be this global cultural shift in the way people are looking at cannabis laws and the people that are coming out now are more and stuff than ever. You're seeing some big names like several members of the DEA that are now part of leap that are talking out against the big time. Well, it's a, it's a, it's a crime. It's a criminal thing. What they're doing, what they're doing is they're somehow or another, they are being forced into a situation where they're ignoring the science and ignoring the, the, the, um, health benefits and ignoring the medicinal benefits and just the fact that people enjoy it and joy and, and, and the fact that there's virtually no one has ever died from it ever.

Speaker 5:          00:56:55       Really. Realistically, no one has ever die from it. Just that, just that, that anybody keeping you from that, anybody that keeping you from that, that's not your friend, that's not your friend. That's craziness. It's craziness that they think they can keep you from an experience because that's really at the end of the day, what it really is, you're still responsible for your actions. You shouldn't be driving. We baked out of your fucking head and forget which way to turn the middle of an intersection cause we'll fucking dark man. I shouldn't ask you much nyquil. Exactly. Exactly. But you should be responsible for your actions and that that is what being a human being should be all about. Carry your own weight, take responsibility for the sh the shit that you fuck up. If you fuck up something because you're high, like you'd go and smash a window if it's not the high you.

Speaker 5:          00:57:39       A lot of people could have been high in, they walk right by that window and didn't want to break it at all. You are an asshole man and you should have to pay for that fucking window. But there's nothing to do with weed. Joe, come, come run a nightclub and you want to see a ticking time bomb. Oh my God, I couldn't. Then there's people on booze where I've, I've had this conversation a million times and I used to work the door and you have to escort them l cause they're too drunk. Right core. And then the mood when mean this is a board and I'm like, yeah, where you're allowed to drink but you can't get wasted. Right. So then, but then this goes around in a circle and a big fine, fine. They get out the door and then they forget and to come up.

Speaker 5:          00:58:12       So when they get kicked, Oh man, cause you're too drunk, dude. It's a board. I'm like, I just went through this wreck. Like, I honestly can't understand. I'm like, are you that like is it really just goes in, it goes blank and then goes blank and keeps coming and then they start getting as you keep being nice and you're like, listen, you're done for tonight. Come back tomorrow. I'll even, I'll even pay your cover tomorrow if you come back. But tonight you're done. That's very generous of, you know, and that's, that was always the offer. Be like, I'll help you get a cab and a wave your coverage to come back tomorrow, but tonight you're done. And then they take your kindness Renin and they start being like, yeah, well then fucking and the boost or like it just, you see them morph into this person you like and I bet when he was sober he would just be a nice guy.

Speaker 5:          00:58:51       But then there will suddenly, it's like he gets too drunk, he wants to be an ass. You start off as polite as you can and they'll be polite and then their emotions shift. And those any get dumbest thing to do too is when you're out and you're drunk and you'd be a Douche bag to a bouncer. It's such a bad move. I'm such a bad move. I've worked the door and I never got that logic where someone's like, oh, well you make 10 books now where you're trying to get the gold star. Some people are just assholes. You know, we, you Kinda,

Speaker 1:          00:59:22       I have a, uh, I mean, it sounds ridiculous, but I have great respect for cops and great respect for people who are working, you know, a security in a club or a nightclub or something like that. Like, that's a, that's a difficult position. It's a, it's a dangerous Bishan. Thank you very much. That's how I feel about it. Like, so when I, if, if ever I'm in a situation, if I ever was, I'm never are, but if I was, I'll be very polite. But no, sir. Uh, you know, none, none, no craziness, no wanting to fight the cop, you know, like Jesus Christ. Those people are assholes. It's, you know, you can't blame alcohol for those people. I don't know what it is. I don't know what causes it. But you can't blame alcohol when a guy tries to punch a cop. You know those guys, like some people damages that.

Speaker 1:          01:00:03       It's like that's the thing you're serving. They see in colonial area, there's a lot and a lot of growers. That's how I knew so much about the details of the union. Right. How it all broke down. I looked at getting into it when my dad first died and he passed away like as to supplement me to go to film school. Right. I looked at being the Latin landowner that would buy the house, have people that would grow for me, I'd come back every three months, but the cash 50 50 but then dangerous. Is that dangerous? Right. Canada is much more lenient than it is in the u s for sure. But I, I didn't do it and that was originally the beginning of the union. We cut my story out because we thought at the end of the day, the union is so much bigger than my story. It's not care.

Speaker 1:          01:00:41       So we cut it out. But that's what got us into that. And originally when we were going to do the union, we're just going to do an expo, say the BC industry. Right. And how it's so evolved and how like there's a mortgage broker that'll help you cause you got bad credit and they'll send you to this banker to help put it through and that you've got to realtor. Like they all know, like even my, one of my friends worked at a car dealership and they went to their discretion whether or not things could flag. Is that how that works? Well you know the banks, it's, why am I asking this? So Am I going into organized crime?

Speaker 1:          01:01:12       So nosy mill, it's interesting and it's one that some people's favorite part of the union, right? But you can, that was where I felt guilty is that a lot of these guys would come in in the wintertime. Colona's Dad, it's a summer town and they would come in and they got the most disposable income because they've got some cash that they of always put into things. So then they come in and spend two or three grand and that's awesome for us. Right? Like I'm like, yeah, and then but I'm like, okay, who's the bad guy here? Like a lot of people say he's bad, he's a drug dealer, he's growing but then I know what he does and I'm gladly taking his money to serve another drug. Right. So then I was like, how am I any better? Right. He's not a drug dealer. He was selling weed or if that is a completely different connection than someone who will, who will sell you something that's fucked up. True are dudes who are real drug casual about it. Get people hooked. There's people that are like real clever about it. I've known the guys that have sold coke and stuff. I owned a club through that. But it's, the problem is, is that while it's still like the way it is, well a lot of them are controlled or they get ripped off by gangs and fray. That's where it seems like

Speaker 5:          01:02:19       now in Canada you can get a federal license. That's the way a lot of guys are going. If they don't have a criminal record, they can get a federal license. So there's no like here that you have a state license and the feds come in, like you get a federal license and you can grow. Why he does no reasons. Yeah. Okay. But don't you have like a dispute in certain parts of Canada where there's far more conservative? They don't feel the same way about marijuana and they do, but that's, that is a federal license that they're looking now to try to shut down, but it's to grow because there's people whose looking to try shows down. Oh, the government's looking to change it, change it back to make it not available. I'm not sure of all that. We have to dive into that one as we get into the research.

Speaker 5:          01:02:54       But they're trying to pull it back. But it was interesting. I just went into a huge grow op. It just outside of my town, there was a total legal one and it had like 19 permits for like they could do the clones, they could store for others, they could do huge, huge operational show you pictures on my phone. It was like, I think they, I think they said they had 150 lights. So if you, and they were getting high times, they're doing an article cause they were getting 2.2 pounds of light. So they're getting like 150 pounds, 170 pounds every but completely legal. Like they had cameras when I was there, the cops were coming through it with them and this thing was so clean, Joe Bryant, they had offered music, they had opera music playing in the, in the thing because planting in it enhances their growth cycle.

Speaker 5:          01:03:40       My God, I want to move to Canada, I want to move to Canada. So they wanted me to come cause I was a union guy. They're like, ah yeah, you can fill them anything you want in here. And, and it was beautiful. I'll show you guys some pictures. I got them on the phone is too fucking stupid to let that happen. But that would be of great benefit to people. It would provide jobs, it would change the economy, and once marijuana became legal than hemp could would become legal. Then we'll have legal in Canada too, which I know. Yeah, we were selling I'd on it. We're going to start selling this hemp protein powder. It's fucking awesome, man. I've been, there's a dark chocolate, I forget the the company's name, but I've been drinking this stuff really steady for like a couple months now. It's like hemp, hemp protein doesn't give me like terrible gas.

Speaker 5:          01:04:22       It doesn't fuck with me. It feels like really healthy. It's like a really easily digestible plant protein for me. I really love it man. It really been getting into it, but we can't get any fucking hemp hearts. It's really hard. You can only get 50 pounds a day. That's the most you can order. So it's like the hemp part is just so bizarre to me because that makes just 0 million cents. So you can, like we explained in the movie like super, yeah, you can use it manufacturer to ship at everything but grow it here in the u s so stupid because when people don't even understand is like hemp is not psychoactive. Like you can't even get high from it. It's, it's a, it's like a cousin plant to the psychoactive version of marijuana. Although you could use marijuana as well. You could use the stems and the sticks. I mean it's the same shit. It's hemp. It's just that the flowers of the marijuana plants are the ones that get you high. So it's not whether or not people could, I guess someone could pretend like, oh, booth was Joseph. None,

Speaker 6:          01:05:18       but I have beautiful flowers, flowers. What would you say? Oh, what happened here? This is a mistake. Oh, how did this, how did this lie? Oh, well let me pull this out. This is the devil. But the rest of them just for making underwear and paper. Well, I think it, once it happened, the thing is though,

Speaker 5:          01:05:37       once it gets impregnated then the whole crop, like you can't keep just the one or two like that. You don't know enough about, I don't know enough about the botany of how it grows, but I don't know. But I think a lot of people think too is they don't realize like have you seen some of the products it's being used for like in the new Bugattis and stuff like that. The interiors she, that Lotus that they made out of him, they made a of this Badass Lotus and it's like part of it was like just the actual fiber, not even colored. The actual fiber of bright. See if he could pull up a picture of that cause it really is dope. Like Lotus handle car. Did you know that Henry Ford's is that you're moving, you're moving. Well that's not mine, but there's a little clip like that that there's, I know about Henry Ford stopped.

Speaker 5:          01:06:19       It was in the union. No, we do have an opening bit that talks big about hemp, not Henry for his videos. Just that little clip that's up there on its own. For folks who don't know, Henry Ford's first car was made out of hemp, like he made him body panels that you see that Lotus for folks who are following us on Ustream, if you're not just just Google, uh, hemp Lotus. There's a couple other pictures of this thing, um, that maybe you could see it a little clearer, Brian. But what it is is they made a car instead of like, like Corvettes are made out of fiberglass, you know, and like a really expensive cars. A lot of them are made out of carbon fiber. Well this car is made out of hemp and it's stronger than fiberglass. It's, it's a natural pride or two lighter.

Speaker 5:          01:07:02       They just, there's a car in Canada, bill called the crestal, that's an electric car. That's an all the interior and the majority of the body home brown strip down the front. That's exactly, that's the actual hemp color. That's the actual fiber. It's so bad ass man. And it's really fucking durable. It's a crazy plant. It's like you could get a stock and it's really thick and it's light as fuck. Like you pick it up and like it feels like nothing, but it's so dense, like it's really weird if no one has ever seen. If you've never seen a hemp stalk before, it really does feel like, okay, maybe this is an alien plant. Like wait, maybe this is not like any plant I've ever come in contact before. If you pick up an oak log, you know the thickness and the would that would it?

Speaker 5:          01:07:44       That feels like it's heavy as shit. Right? Well, the hemp stocks feel like the hardness of an oak log, but it's like really light. It's weird. It's like where the fuck did this thing come from? It's, it's crazy. I mean we, I, we knew, I knew nothing about pot and when I started in the Union now they wanted to do, that's hilarious. I just wanted to do, like I said, the x was a to BC industry. Then when we discovered all these things, that's why some people that really knew everything in there was like, well, like a lot of the activists, like I knew everything in the union. It was like, yeah, but oh, how dare you.

Speaker 1:          01:08:16       Me and like 99% of other people don't. So there's a lot of weeks that know they think that everybody should catch up. Yeah, I knew all that stuff will and, and here's the Kudos that I even, I didn't really, I, it really clicked with me when we were parliament hill is that how entertained they were. Right. And there's four of them that weren't going to stay. They're going to be there for 15 minutes and they were going to leave and they stayed throughout the whole film. And at the end they were saying that like, I didn't know it'd be that funny and I didn't know what a B and Brett was like, well that's the key to getting you to absorb information is it still has to be, it's still a movie. It has to be entertaining. If it was just a blurb and it was like, here we are at or sometimes people forget that most people don't know that information.

Speaker 1:          01:08:56       Most people don't and it you cannot tell the story without giving that information. If you want things to be reached by a giant gang of people, you cannot assume that they already have this information. It's too potent. It's too important. It's too significant. And the story, well that's why we're diving into the second one. We're going all out. What is the second one going to get involved with the culture? I we're looking much more global this time and like I sold looking at the cultural shift that's starting to happen with regards to the way people look at. What do you accredit that you, do you think the Internet is responsible for that? Is that we, yes. The distribution of the truth about marijuana. That's exactly, that's actually a part in it. We want to interview, you know Sean Parker and some of those people like to talk about how the Internet, even the playing field, like remembering the union.

Speaker 1:          01:09:40       We have Ronald Reagan saying, you know, and I'm surprised the scientists haven't brought out this new information that says that marijuana, it could be the most dangerous drug that is in use in our society today. When he said that in the 80s like unless you're going to go call a medical facility and polar old records, like you're like, hey man, that's, that's present. He's, he must know he is a team that's giving them that information and he's got it right. But now you can go on Google and you can look at, and of course you get the good with the bad. There's a lot of fake and hate it when people going back and forth for saying this. But you know, you can pick or choose through 10 10 or more articles and that's it. We did in the union, we put all the links and stuff up there.

Speaker 1:          01:10:15       So like if you didn't believe what we said and like, hey, we're filmmakers, there's one or two little mistakes and there that we made. Absolutely. But if it got you to research it and start doing it, that's a great movie because you're thinking about it after you've watched with a factual mistakes that you missed all their very, very slight. It was like with the original declaration of independence, it was actually the first two drafts, not the one that's in the museum, the one that's in the museum's made with high. But the first two drafts were written on hemp. So it was a lot of his like clever were, and then you know, same with the 30 days of marijuana being in your system. Lester Grinspoon, the First Ivy League doctor to come out and talk about, um, the, the real medical findings that he discovered. He said, it's not always 30 days, like if you smoke all the time and it's in your fat cells, but it can be if you just smoke once in the first time, there's a good chance in two weeks we're going to be in your system. So, so when you hear about a guy like Nick Diaz, kitten popped and he's got like the non psychoactive metabolites, what does that mean?

Speaker 5:          01:11:14       Does that mean he's like, he's like really gotten any weakness system, right? Barely. Barely, barely. I think that uh, you know, if, if they're gonna I mean those guys go through so much pain and you've seen a lot of tragedy with the painkillers. Now. Like, I mean, a friend of mine, Derek Boogaard who was, you know, an Nhl enforcer, uh, for the New York Rangers, you know, how to, uh, accidental mix and I, you, you'd wished that there would be that alternative for pain. So maybe Nick Diaz, his knuckles are sore. He hits people, he hits dudes a lot of times in a fight, like more than anybody else. They just don't stop. Right. So, you know, maybe as he's got arthritis in his hands are from training. That's what he wanted to use. Like at how, by it, whatever the fuck reason he wants to use it.

Speaker 5:          01:11:58       But I'm saying even if that's my, my take on it now at this point, it's like, yeah, of course he should be able to use it for anxiety. Of course he should be able to use it for insomnia. Of course he should be able to use it, but he really, he should be able to use it for whatever the fuck he wants to use it for. And this idea that there's any reason why it should be illegal is just crazy talk. It's crazy talk. It makes you a nicer person. It does. It might make some people a little dope here, but guess what? That probably means you need to get their shit together. They're probably thinking a bunch of dumb stupid shit when they're sober and when they're high, there's not much to spin around in there. Maybe it's good for them to feel stupid.

Speaker 5:          01:12:33       Well think, think about it for the pain. I'm sure you know fighters, Joe, that if taken like the hard painkillers and then a lot of notes that I need to realize their whole careers because of that stuff. And they don't even know how addictive it is. Right? The doctor says, take this for pain. They get hooked to it. So, I mean, just that when I've seen in athletes, like they have to go through a lot of pain and these constant man, I know a dude who was a s a really like completely clean guy. He didn't smoke cigarettes, he rarely ever drank. He was a really healthy, and he was a professional pool player. He hurt his back and he got hooked on pain pills and became a complete total mess and then died. I mean they, they literally took this dude's life. This dude got swamped up in that world of pills and he's younger than me and now he's gone.

Speaker 5:          01:13:21       You know? And I, I knew him, I knew him when he was totally healthy and I knew him when he was gone. And that's crazy. It's crazy. It's a sad thing. He was like proud, proud guy. And he would like fall asleep in a plate of mashed potatoes, like that kind of shit. And that's lead. See how many people I saw like that in the Bardo. Like you'd see those, how many, you see these beautiful girls come in and then like four years later they're like, hey, and you're like, it's and a lot of the dancers and you're like, Hey, oh my God. Like you look like you've died and come back to life already sad. Those kind of drugs are so terrible. They're so sad. And your body, it's just a, it's a Shitty, I wouldn't recommend owning a nightclub if someone, if someone said to me like, Hey, I'll do like hi, just, I don't ever want to be in that business again.

Speaker 5:          01:14:02       Our business is rough man. You know? So I'd rather, I'd rather be a challenge like a struggling filmmaker that's, you know, working three jobs like I am then go back to that. Yeah. Well you, you dealing with groups of drunks on a regular basis, it's like and seeing and then you know, seeing the sad stories like that or seeing like times when a guy just got out of line and bumped into the wrong person and got smashed. Yeah, that sucks too. I watched a guy get hit in the face with a bottle once. It never, you know, I never expected this to happen the way it happened, the way the guy hit the guy in the face, it was like there's no way he just did that for that reason. It was like nothing. And this kind of smashed him in the face, cut his face.

Speaker 5:          01:14:38       And I remember thinking now like always be aware that it's possible that someone out there is so fucking crazy that they would do that for no reason like that. Oh, that's why when I worked the door, I never let someone get to the odd side of me or anything like that. Right. And a lot of the times it's some ways aggressive in their hands. Clench. You don't see it. I mean we would, I always tell them, I was like, listen, you're not supposed to strike and hit guys, but if, if you're really threatened, right. And some guy you're in a corner, like you do what you got to do to look after yourself. Right. We'll try to get there as fast as we can. But I mean we had a doorman stabbed, oh shit, he got stabbed three times and probably the only time in your life you like to hear this, they told them they're like, it's a good thing you're overweight because if you would have been an inch thick inch thinner it would appears major.

Speaker 5:          01:15:18       Cause the guy that got Dave through these guys out with the guys went out to the car, came back and then they went at the Dorman and one of our dorm and knocked the first one out. Then he went with the other one. He was tussling with him and he said he put him down and then when he put them down and he saw the blade hit the ground and blood all over it and then he punched in the side and then he looked and he was like holy. It was just pouring out and uni. And then I remember him telling the story that really scared me as he sat down and he went to our other dorm and just being like, if I pass out, please make sure I get to the hospital. Cause you don't know what's going to happen if your body's going to shut down or like, you know, you might just faint out, but you're, you know, so it's, it's, it's shitty.

Speaker 5:          01:15:54       I, I'd never want to let another nightclub. Fuck that. Yeah. There's just too many douche bags. They can't keep it together. It's too many people out there really at the roadhouse pay hurts really at the heart of it, at the bottom at all. It's, it's really people doing a shitty job of raising people, people doing a shitty job of having a community and doing a shitty job of raising people. And what do you make? You make shit kids. No Shit. Kids grow up to be gigantic fucking problems. And if you run a nightclub, congratulations, you're the new babysitter. Well you're a new, the new babysitter for the drunken Douche bag and then anything that they do, like they're not held responsible. Like if they, that's where, going back to the responsibility thing, you were saying, people should just be held to their actions where what you get for nightclub and you can get sued then they go out, not just that.

Speaker 5:          01:16:38       They go and fight or hurt someone or they attack our bouncers and then they get hurt on the way out. And yes, of course there's other sides that were, sometimes the doormen are excessive, but there's times where guys so drunk, they like, you carry him out, you don't, you go to let him go. And he stumbles and smashes his face on the concrete and caves his cheekbone. And right, like I worked as a security guard at great woods, uh, center for the performing art. It's like, it's like in Mansfield or something, Massachusetts. I think that's where it's at. And it's, um, it's um, this outside performance area. So it's, it's a part

Speaker 2:          01:17:10       of it is inside and part of it is like covered, but then there's a back area that's open that's like a lawn area. And I was security there and we did it for a whole summer. And I tell you, man, after a while you really develop this us versus them mentality. And it's really stupid. But I was 19. I was an idiot. I shouldn't have been in that sort of a job in the first place. And the guy that I was working for was carets. He aggressive. I mean, oh my God, I saw him on the first day. I worked there Taqa guy and beat him with a walkie talkie because the guy stole their golf cart. They had a golf cart, they would drive around the, the great woods width. So these guys tackle them and they beat the shit out of this guy with a, with a walkie talkie.

Speaker 2:          01:17:50       That dude was a classic. His name was alley cat. And uh, he wanted to open up this bar. He had this dream, you know, he was the head security guy with a dream and his dream was to open up this bar alley cats, libations and victuals. And I remember it was the title. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Because marketing, those are the victuals is, was like a cool name for food. And libations is like a cool old name for liquors and drink. And so that was his, that was his dream. And he was a crazy motherfucker. And he ran, he ran the security thing and it was me and a friend of mine who was, uh, we were, um, on the same competition teams, same taekwondo competition team. He got a job there and they said, do you have any, any of the other guys that are martial arts guys that want a job? And so they essentially hired all the top martial arts guys from this Jay Kim Taekwondo Institute. And they were all the security for this place. But I was, I was like, this is the craziest idea ever. He was like seven or eight people you know, that have like the security jackets on and it was like fucking thousand.

Speaker 1:          01:18:52       Oh yeah. Thousands of crazy assholes. And I will always wear a jacket over my security jacket. Like I would just try to blend in as much as possible. I'm like, I'm way too short for this too. I'm only five, eight. I can't be around like big giant dudes with a security jacket on. That shit's ridiculous. You know, I want to have to fucking punch and kick my way out of this. Oh well that was, I remember there'd be slow nights, right, where you'd have a big rowdy like sports team come in, right. And it'd be like the bartender and you'd have one dorm and on, cause it's a slow night or two and then you'd literally, they begin rowdy and starting to smash glasses. And then literally we'd have to think like, okay, like be ready, like Gba ready to jump over the bar if you have to help.

Speaker 1:          01:19:31       Right. If these guys get to a point where they really want to cause something that you say, it can be so weird that you just politely ask them to do something and then they get super aggressive. Well I then, and then they, then they just really look at size where they're like, fuck, there's like nine of us and we're all in good shape and there's only two or three of them. Like why do I have to respect this guy? Yeah, it can get bad. But what a lot of people didn't know it was in a small town is a lot of like the people hanging out. We're really good friends with the staff. They come there all the time. So the odd times that that happened when I was doing it, you'd have people jump in from outside. Right? Cause they was like serve as the community more or less you, you'd have friends that just the common, you know when their regular you treat them good and then they'd come in and I'll tell you the one time my dad was friends with a lot of the big Mc guys and when they used to come in there was never a problem in the bar because everyone was worried about bumping into, one of them are like, you know some idiots wrestling and they fall into a table.

Speaker 1:          01:20:27       So like it was weird on those nights it would be is usually the young like just starting to slang little gang bangers that think that they're all that and they have something to prove and they, they're doing something for somebody else where they've got some kind of connections are nutty Gig for you man. And to be only 23 years of age and having a handle all that. Oh Man. My, my wife. That's, that's, I mean why I married her. She was a trooper through that too. Did it last before you got rid of it? Oh, I had to get, my dad passed away in 2003 and we were out of there by 2005 so for two years you got to run that mother. If I had to get proper books because my dad didn't do proper books. Oh. And so to sell to a legit buyer, they wanted to use two or three years of books.

Speaker 1:          01:21:05       Right. I talk to my friend Bobby. Yeah, well that was over the situation. Well, trust me, there was lots of bad Bobby's coming around. But my thing was like, okay, if I took it is only one bad. Bobby, you don't know bad by, I mean, I mean bad, but guys that would come with a cash offer. Right? And then if there's a cash offer that sounds like bad Bobby. Well, but then, but then in three years, if it doesn't do the numbers they think and they say, well, I don't think I overpaid. I want some back. Right. So that's like, that's why I was like, okay, I don't want to go that option. So tried to work it out with like a childhood friend and then you know, didn't do that right either because we didn't put everything on paper. So I got screwed and had to start for, I remember when my wife was eight months pregnant with Riley and my daughter and, and uh, we had negative $400 in our account and I needed $45,000 to finish the union and I didn't know where I was going to get it.

Speaker 1:          01:21:57       Suck that Dixon to just think about it. No, fuck about us. You can find a rich guy and suck his dick for a million. I was in New York and worked around those guys would be no way. Yeah. Would if, you know, like for whatever reason you got flown to John Travolta's house. No, no, no man, I got bad stories about those lists and you know, man, I did that stuff in New York. I lived in a model house in New York. Not that I don't want to get you in anything. You don't want to talk about it, but, no, no, no, no. Me a nod to gay. Never for the record. Never did any gain shit shorty. I'm sure. But uh, no. I lived in a model house cause I used to work for men. Thank you for it not getting upset. Oh, I know. I wouldn't get upset.

Speaker 1:          01:22:39       I've listened to your show. I've listened since you guys had snowflakes. I know that the shows that well. Yeah. Well we've hung out a bunch of time span. It was fun. The UFC a up in Vancouver, but right now I don't think they can come back. I think, I don't know. I think there's some problem with the regulatory, well, I want to try to come see me in Calgary. There was some sort of a ruling against a MMA of Vancouver. I'm come on, really trying to remember what the actual ease, no problem was. Yeah, let me, let me Google this real

Speaker 5:          01:23:06       quick. I don't know man. You know, it's like friends, like it's a fucking problem all over the world, dude. People Successful Shows York that want to see the UFC and somehow or another it's been um, uh, what am I going to do? They still sell players cigarettes in Canada. Oh, you bet. Wow. That's great. What am I Google it again? Jesus Christ. UFC. Now going back to Vancouver. Vancouver, right. You guys are coming to Calgary soon. That's not far from where I am. Well, eight hour drive. I got so upset. I was the all I can think of as Bob Riley, I start thinking about New York. I completely spaced on Vancouver because the New York thing drives me fucking crazy. So illogical and it's so corrupted. It's so gross. The people of New York would make a lot of fucking money if they came. If the UFC came to Madison Square Garden, it would be fucking huge.

Speaker 5:          01:23:54       How about this John Jones versus Anderson Silva or Anderson Silva versus George Saint Pierre, something like that. Inside Madison fucking square garden and I'm like a kid in Canada. I would, that's our cots are keeping that from happening. That could fucking happen. What's the hole back there? Some, I don't even want to name names, political bullshit, nonsense, culinary, union, fucking whatever, whatever. A lot of corruption as people are getting greased, the, the desire of the people is getting ignored. People want to have it in the state. It generates money. The amount of fans that they have in New York City alone, it's fucking through the roof. Everywhere you look, there's a Jujitsu school in New York does MMA, gyms, boxing gyms. People are allowed to enjoy it and for some asshole politician with some fucking backing by whatever creepy organization that's trying to keep this shit out, it's ridiculous because it violates the will of the people.

Speaker 5:          01:24:55       Anybody that does that is a shit politician. That's a sad statement. That's an anti American thing to do. You're trying to keep something away from people that want it and you're trying to block a business and you're trying to do it because you're in cahoots with a different business. That should be illegal, but shit, that's corruption. I can picture. I did. It's not a mirror would be a mistake within our come back to Vancouver. It's not American. You're leaving Vancouver for Calgary. Yeah. You guys are coming to Calgary. That's all good. I don't know man. I feel still watch NBC, but okay, here's the latest legislation opens door for ultimate fighting championship. You okay? So this sounds good. Maybe I read that wrong. I can't pay attention everything folks. The fucking, I know people always go with me. Some people try to come up with the toughest questions about marijuana and be like, what do you think about this law that was passed in Missouri two weeks ago?

Speaker 5:          01:25:49       And I'm like, man, sorry. I do my best to try to stay up to date on everything, but I, it is physically impossible. I don't know what's going on in Missouri. So they did stop it. They, there was an introduction of a provincial law designed to break the directed a, the deadlock over regularly regulation and supervision of Combat Sports. So originally they stopped it and now they're trying to figure out the correct way to regulate what's going on. Now it seems like they're opening the door to it. Coming back. I think people do, you know, ultimately the here, the will of the people, especially today so popular in Canada, people don't even understand. It's hugely popular in America. Way more popular in Canada. No, it's like in Canada. It's not like when there's a UFC, it's not like, are you watching the fights? It's like, where are you going to watch the fights?

Speaker 5:          01:26:36       Like dude, we were at the fucking watchers arena. That gigantic Roger Center, whatever it is. What is it called? Is it the Roger Center? The things crazy building that's, it's so big. There's a hotel inside of it. There's a hotel inside of it and they used to play baseball indoors. That's how big this place is. And it was filled for the, I mean, I don't know if they could do that in America. I mean, maybe they could. It was George Saint Pierre and Anderson Silva. I guarantee you they could do that in America. But that's a big goddamn crowd. No, it's Canada's nutty for it. We, it has less people. Yeah, we're, we're, but I think that comes a lot with the hockey culture, right? There's been fighting in the hockey culture for years, which is like our national sport. I hate to say this, but I think there's more fucking manly men per capita in Canada or more condoms.

Speaker 5:          01:27:22       I just think, you know, I think they, I think you come from a country, first of all, that has to survive the cold. Right? And I think that's good for your character. You know, I've always compared, uh, people that have it soft to people that had it tough and you always see the people that have had like the most interesting people that I know are all people that had it tough. You know, when you have, it's soft, it's easy, just come out fucking useless. When they got it, they got those, those battle scars, even if they're not physical ones. Right. The wounds of going through that. That's a lot of times people said, I have an old soul for, that's one of the gas thing someone can ever say to you and you need to get away from him. Probably trying to fuck you. Right.

Speaker 5:          01:28:01       If it's a dude, especially, it was a woman who she's definitely trying to fuck you. Look at your handsome ambassador. No, I was at a restaurant once and I actually heard that hack line, that old soul, a guy was like reading a book. It was the weirdest thing, man. He's an actor that was in, um, I don't even want to say his name, just some weird old actor that was in a bunch of movies and then they probably went crazy. So he's sitting by himself with a book, which is what you do at a restaurant if you go to a nice place. And so there's this couple next to me just starts introducing himself. Would you do, sorry, sorry. Glitch. Yeah. He just, he starts introducing himself into their conversation and talking to them. And then he's like telling this, uh, this man that he has an old soul that's lame. And I'm like, not now you're making me feel that I use that choice of words. No, it's, I mean it's look you, you, you said what you mean, you know, it's not nothing wrong with it, but I had a funny old soul story so yeah, I did just have a funny, a funny image. He like wore a Bandana. He's one of those assholes sit by himself eating dinner with a Bandana on his head. Okay. What the

Speaker 1:          01:29:02       fuck are you doing? Reading a book? We used to get those guys in the nightclub to, they'd come in and sit in the corner, read a book. It's like really? This probably the loudest, most annoying place to read it. You're better off just to have a drink and stare at the girls cause that's what you really would like that though. You know, it's like some people like to work at Starbucks, they want to hear people come in and come out. That I could understand but a nightclub like we can't even hear yourself think like that shit man. People are weird. You know, he pulled a weird dude. I don't have to tell you. You were running a god Damn Strip Club, Strip club connection at 23 years of age. How did you avoid getting sucked into the clutches of organized crime? I just, well I left originally when I was younger and went to New York and I wanted to get into the film industry and stuff like that.

Speaker 1:          01:29:43       So I, I, I just, I don't know, when I came back I never, it wasn't much of a big drinker and wasn't into the party scene. So I was, luckily I didn't fall into that. That trap. It was union was like the first thing you ever did. Really? Yeah. The first thing I'd ever produced. Yes. Did such a fucking bang up job of it, man. And you, you went to some real creepy places like you, you were like sort of an investigative reporter in, you know, in that movie. Like when you went to those places where you went to those drain tiles. Yeah, man, explain that cause that's of crazy. Well we knew the people that were busted in there and obviously, and explain what the situation. Okay. Well there is for the people listening at home, didn't know there was 20 full size, like those square, they're not actual train cards, but they're the cargo carts that they put on the trains and they'd actually buried them and connected them together so that if you were to look at them that it'd be five rows with two each way.

Speaker 1:          01:30:34       So like, or no, 10 rows with two each way. So like 20 full sized train cars buried underground and they had a giant grow up under there and it was 10 miles in the mountain where there isn't a neighbor. You can hear the craziest part joke. The guy that got that busted actually snuck in there and took pictures one night to show the cops so they can go, oh my God. Balls and way up in the Bush like way the fuck out. They're balls of adamant Tanium oh man. But yeah, that, that had 287 lights. What is Wolverine's bones? Adamantium but that's how I always said and she's a soccer balls to 287 lights and they were both going to make just the growers that I knew in there. We're going to make half a million in one year. And so what happens now, because it's not lake, they got routed. So we got very lucky. One of them got nothing. Got It. Totally wiped. The lawyer got her off and the other guy just got house arrest and had to pay a big fine.

Speaker 1:          01:31:31       Whoa. Yeah. Canada is going at it. Gangster style. I like it because it's, they also have a lot of money to fight it in court right now. Don't wait that man. I think Canada is probably, it's very obviously being influenced by the policies of the United States. Definitely the, the United States has like, you know, they have set parameters for Canada and told them very specifically, they don't want them making marijuana illegal or making illegal rather, I mean this has been this, it's been held up by your carrot, you know, and whenever you know, discussions, we have diplomacy me, we'll kind of diplomacy that we have when we're, we'll let completely connected, you know, I mean are, we will never, you know, Canada in the United States, it's so weird that we're two separate countries. Really. It is, cause we're connected. You can drive there everywhere you get.

Speaker 1:          01:32:16       The whole thing is drivable. Well that's, that's why I see where may not really this woods, you know, we're, we're, we're Kalona is clone is rate on a border there and I'm the lake and there's a lake in a serious, that's got half of it as in the u s and half it is Canada. So you can drive your boat out. Right. And then you're like, and they're there and they're there. Yeah. The marine guys, my verve or all day long. That's so gross. That's so fucking North Korea, man. And it's, yeah, it's bizarre when you think about it, but there was guys I knew from Colona that were smuggling, they'd get these one body submarines and go underneath it so they could get into the, it's so eggs, submarines, Jesus Christ. It's, it's literally, if you see Colona it's late. It's, it looks, they're the rock stars. Like if they're doing well, especially in the late nineties when the US dollar was like nine 55 cents on the Canadian dollar and they were getting like 4,500 us a pound and then that was transferring to like 6,000 Canadian.

Speaker 1:          01:33:12       Wow. They were making a killing. It's amazing man. And in, in Colona like NBC a lot. Like we sadly, it's like one in seven is what the economists said of like living dwelling units or one in 100 it has it. And then the grow ops, like when you say they're in the almost one in 100 has, it has a potential grow up in it. So every hundred houses there's one house to grow up. And what is the one in seven, the one in seven in certain blocks in like outer small towns of where there's grow ops in these farms and it's one in seven in those areas. Oh my God. There's been small towns that they've done articles on that literally the town had nothing. Everything was dry. Then some guys came off there, the big grow up, they're paying all the guys to do construction, good cash.

Speaker 1:          01:33:55       And of course that's the whole thing of why this union evolved. Because like the guys building the shed or the electrician setting up the lights, that's not illegal. Right? As long as you're not stealing the power. So if he gets come to wire it all and the guy's like, oh, here, here's six grand cash, call it even. Well of course, even the electricians like sweet not thinking to declare all that, right. So there's a like a love hate relationship that's built around the business of it, right? Which we break down in the union. I'm rattling on about that. It's a real strange sort of situation because uh, it's a much, much more illegal in certain parts of America. Like if you had to try to run an operation like that in Texas, they'll fucking get you, man. They'll come and get you. Don't mess with Texas. I lived in Texas a shame. I fucking love Texas, man. Texas is one of my favorite places to visit. I, I did my first CD in Houston. I did my first where I lived and he used to be my first DVD and Austin. I mean I fucking love taxes, but make no mistake about it there. There's some curve. That's a really fucking suppressive situation that you have there when it comes to marijuana in Texas.

Speaker 5:          01:34:58       Yeah, I'll give you get caught with medical marijuana. If you're like some dude with the prescription, you could still get in trouble. They're like, they don't respect how you want to be builders recommendation or of nonsense. Like you got some drugs on you boy on a year and over faggotry about your fucking prescription union, you know, prescription here in Texas. I in that. It's great. Meanwhile, everybody could use some wheat if, if all of Texas. It's the irony of it all is that if all of Texas had weed, the cops jobs we way fucking easier, way easier. That's a fact, man. The people would chill out. They would get all paranoid and shit and they do less crime because of that. And then they would also just be, you know, be a little bit more sensitive to what the fuck is actually going on. And what are the repercussions of your, your evil actions out there?

Speaker 5:          01:35:45       Robbing people. Settle the fuck down, dude. For Real. They've already proven that it's had a decline in automobile accidents in places where marijuana, medical marijuana is legal. I can't, I can't wait to dive into the call. Like for me, I may or may not be true because you know what, I did no research on that whatsoever. I read it on low. That does. So I can't wait. Caution, a study done by Dr Rogan absolutely doesn't mean that I'm endorsing smoking pot and drive it cause some people can't handle life. Okay. So I'm not, I would never say that everybody is the same when it comes to tolerance of aspirin. Alcohol causes, seen it with alcohol, everything. You can never tell anybody to do anything because some people can't do shit. But some people are binge eaters. You give them one little piece of sugary something and they'll go crazy and you, it's a veracious thing.

Speaker 5:          01:36:35       I've watched people polished down like ice cream Sundaes that she shouldn't have had an ice cream Sundae. And it's like, wow, like it's our gas make. Like this guy is like fulfilling some just deep hole inside of them with this. This is like sexual, almost like he's fucking this ice cream. You know what I mean? Well it's tough like when you look at junk, like I wish, you know, when you go look at some of that for me, I'm a pastry guy cause my grandmother was Italian. Right. So like I, when I see that stuff I'm like, oh, I can just eat a tray of it. Right? Like, and then it's like, what is your shit? Do you like, um, all those, the polio, Ian's man, you know, the three layers with the chocolate top. That was one of my favorite from my grandmother. Oh, those were my, I just called them the three layer cookie.

Speaker 5:          01:37:15       Those I used to eat those things. So that was the only time I grab him get mad is when she'd save them for the big Christmas parties and I go in and raid them and go to lay at the tray spread for all the family and there'd be like six left. All those, my grandmother used to make these other ones that had like a, a black licorice kid. They were like a little biscuit that had like an icing that was slightly black leaders that in niece or whatever or whatever. Those are, you know, it's someone fucked up and forgot to bring to the west coast when good rice pudding. See I always have a bad thought of all right. I haven't had good right. I lived in New York. We used to go to a like little diners you'd like to eat. Like if I was doing standup or something, it stopped at a diner.

Speaker 5:          01:37:54       Like these little, they all had a cheeseburger deluxe and the cheeseburger deluxe was usually two patties and they would give you some coleslaw with and for dessert if you want it to that a little glass thing with like that cake looks good. What's that over there? You guys got any, you got any rice pudding? Yeah, we've got some rice pudding, rice pudding and whipped cream and it's fucking ridiculously delicious. It's so good. And he can't find it on here. It's real rare that you see rice pudding were so common on the east coast. Yeah, I don't, that's not, mine has always been a pastry. So my grandmother made everything homemade, homemade grad, homemade jam. You, you're healthy dude. Do you watch what g I try now I'm getting back out. I just started in the Isogenix actually to get back in shape here. So gen x, it's like the protein shakes.

Speaker 5:          01:38:33       Scientology now? No, no, no, no, no, no. It's the, the weight loss things. Cause I got up to two 24 at six foot and I'm like, I'd be fighting Cain Velasquez right now. I'm like hell. Not that. Like my ideal weight that I want to get down to just one 90 not that that would be much better because it'd be Anderson Silva, but the way, the way I really think like that, like who you guess what? You don't have to fight any of those guys. The weight wouldn't matter what you see. What I think with the Anderson is Elisa, just be like a a Ninja finish, right? Like just bang. You'd finish me before I could breathe Cain, I just picture the savage brutalizing before it'd be like a slam and a crunch and like it just never gets tired. I'd be a mangled pretzel, like his dismantling of big foot Silva was real.

Speaker 5:          01:39:16       It was disturbing because everybody knew before Cain ever came to the UFC, everybody in the know knew about this kid, but former Arizona state wrestler who they were saying was tearing it up at Aki. They're like, this guy is a beast. I mean, I heard a bunch of guys talking about a shale son and who is a, you know, pretty fucking honest with praise or criticism when it comes to fighters. Said, everybody knows the best heavyweight in the world is Cain Velasquez. This is before he ever fought Brock for the title. And so when he mauled Brock people that people in the know were like, wow, yeah, that guy's for real, which makes junior dos Santos is fight and victory over human. The first round, even more staggering. Junior is such a bad mother fucker, man. For Real. It's just so exciting now with all the great guys that are there.

Speaker 5:          01:40:01       Like I get, I could watch every weekend. I'm so pissed off. The ream fight didn't happen. I wanted to, that would be a really fantastic five because that would be one of the first fights where a guy wants to stand up with him. Yeah. No, and that's where it gets really crazy because guess what junior could take guys down to man. He took, um, he took Shane Carwyn down. Well that's a, that's what I, I, it'd be interesting to see what happens if the sand has gets taken out just cause we, yeah, I know he's trained, but I haven't seen him yet. Yeah. You know, he's, he's such a fucking great athlete, man. Junior has some amazing hand speed. Amazing. It's really, really going to be hard for a lot of guys to deal with because he has, uh, he has, uh, an advantage over almost everybody when it comes to the thing that's the easiest to land, which is your hands, you know, it's hard to kick somebody, you know, it's real hard when you worried about God's taking you down to, you know, it's especially hard if the guy's a real good wrestler.

Speaker 5:          01:40:52       It's hard to get those kicks off, but you know, when you're nervous and you're not sure with your footing yet, you're not, you don't have your timing down yet. You're not going to throw, we'll kick. Okay. You're going to show it. If you're going to throw a jab, you can throw a jab. Well, Juniors Jab is like you getting caught in the end of a telephone pole and he throws that shit perfect. Riding your face and he pops you a couple of times on the chin with that shit and you're, you know, you're, you're still in the fight, but you're significantly diminished. I was there for the car when fight. That was in Vancouver. Right. I watched that. That was just like bang, Bang, like amazing. Like amazing, amazing. Kerwin's face stayed together. Colin is up beast dude, that guy is so fucking tough and that if that didn't convince everybody, he could have quit in between rounds.

Speaker 5:          01:41:35       His face was smashed up. They could have called that fight. They could've called that fight. I thought it was, I thought they were going to call it earlier. You know and he's close. He's just so fucking tough man. He is just so fucking tough. He's an animal man. He's a tough, tough dude and a nice fucking guy to Shane Collins. One of the nicest people you'd ever meet. Super friendly, genuinely nice to everybody. He meets. What I've heard you talk in the podcast show, it's, it seems right to cause, I mean I had a boxing background and you know when you go in there, even the best guys have taken a lick and right. And they know what that feeling's like and to get challenged in there and you can get caught on any given night that you are more humble because you go work it out and you've been through there. And I like to go like I went to go try a Jujitsu for my first time a few months ago and you know, cause I did boxing and fought and stuff when I was younger and I wanted to, I'm like I'm so enthralled by, I watch these young kids on youtube now that are doing jujitsu moves and slamming guys. Have you seen the head button knockout of the kid on the one I've seen everything. Every

Speaker 6:          01:42:35       fight that's ever been, I've got a problem. Do a little Ninja kick UK. You've seen this when the guy has a shirt type W into my browser worldstar hip hop comes up. Okay. That's how many fights I've seen it. That's the first thing. Google chrome says all bitch, I know where you're going. What's your first Twitter? Cause mine's like, for some reason it's like something I used to tweet a long time ago, but I haven't been on that for a long time. But for some reason that's always the first one. If I hit t, it comes up Twitter. But it's like backslash something I don't, I shouldn't. Oh really? So like, like it'll come up like weird. Like a, a page that you'd never visited before who had no, I, that early visit I used to visit all the time. And Ex girlfriends happens sometimes, right?

Speaker 6:          01:43:15       Yeah, it's an ex girlfriend and, but so, but every time I pressed tea, it's the first one that comes up. Jesus. Because you're, you're a stalker. You don't realize it in the backyard with the cloud. I think it's in the cloud. And you know what I mean? It's cause I used safari or something. I don't know. Oh yeah. Probably just safari take it's, um, cookies from the cloud to know, fuck knows. I don't know. I don't understand that. You can ask me, don't ask me this. Is this what we gotta do? You gotta all be nice to each other cause we're getting absorbed. We're all going to be one thing. It's happening saboteur right now and we've got to learn. It'd be nice to each other. Learn to do your fucking part here. Pull your own goddamn weights

Speaker 2:          01:43:52       because we are one crazy thing and that's, that shit is slowly being brought to light technologically.

Speaker 1:          01:43:58       Oh Man. Look at the connect. Funny story today. Not maybe I just fucking got high. I made that shit up and it's why I got all excited. I think I was on getting on the plane today from Vancouver. Um, what's her name? Uh, she was Kelly Taylor and nine oh two. I know the Blonde Janine Garth or Jenny Garden Jennie Garth has looking at was like, I think that's her. And then I looked and I went online. Right. And I'm like, what does she look like now? And while my phone, I'm right. Okay. And I look and then, and then I saw on her Twitter it said that she just wrapped filming a movie in Canada. So I was like, okay, that's her. So then I said, oh, I tweeted like, oh, it's like I'm in, I'm in a Yvr and I see this blonde. I think I know I looks familiar and to find out it's her.

Speaker 1:          01:44:38       Oh, she still looks beautiful for her age and then, oh, I just say the age part, you could have got it. So no, I didn't say age. I just said beautiful. Actually I just said beautiful. It's, it's still looks beautiful. No age didn't fit. You can check my Twitter, but yeah, no, no, because I tweeted her in and then she tweeted mother fucker them yet. No, you can check it's there forever. I believe you. I believe you. Right. Fuck my own quotes up all the time. And then she yet, but then I see our, I had put her in it and then she was like, Oh hey, you must have been on my flight. Huh. Thank you. Like, and I was thinking about that like weird. Like, you know, you never had that connectivity like right there, you know, if you, you may contact with a star if you were a big fan of nine oh two oh that would, could have made your year just by going through. Have you followed up freak you out man. Married two kids. There's not feel like you. Of course you are. We're just chugging along with going to the olive garden. For some reason I

Speaker 2:          01:45:31       felt like she had a talk show that maybe I was going to be on. I don't know if I did it, but I did. The Donny and Marie show does get a lot of shows. Man. When I was on news radio, we would do as many shows that they would ask us to do because our show was, you know, not doing that well in the ratings. So I wound up doing the Donny and Marie show. I did it twice. I did it with the chastity Bono before she became chiles. Really? Yeah. Then I'd love to hear stories like what's up before, after which one felt best. I didn't see her. I never met her after, but it was fascinating. It was listening to him now talk about the effect that uh, turning hormonally into a man has had on what he likes and doesn't like.

Speaker 2:          01:46:14       It was really interesting. Yeah, really fascinating. And that mindless babble became incredibly irritating to him, whereas he enjoyed it when he was female, but as, as he made the, so it's not just to stereotype, you're saying, oh, what's C'mon man. It's to, it's silly. It's real. It's real clear in almost all primate cultures that men and women are different. You know? It's just you've got to accept whoever the fuck we are. Just don't try to change each other except the fact that we're absolutely completely different things and just be nice to each other. That's not always, it's fucking hard.

Speaker 5:          01:46:50       That's the hard thing. It's like you're aware. We have to admit, first of all, we're in a corrupt system, so we have to figure out how to fix that without arresting every single fucking he would bang. It's in power in every facet of government that could be responsible and corrupt. We have to figure out a way to make this system make more sense. Like this is not like the right kind of system. Like this seems like too complicated, this whole representative government thing. I mean, I don't know how you guys rock it up in Canada. How you, uh, you know, how you feel about a special interest groups. I mean, do you have this? No, you can't. You can't, uh, uh, in politics in Canada you can't have big business give them money like they can in the US, you can't do that. It's like the maximum they can take from one company is like, I don't know the numbers correctly, so if I get ugly, but it's, it's not very much don't make a mother fucker moved to Canada do because it just keeps, I know you're kind of, then you bring it up.

Speaker 5:          01:47:41       It's the best country, man. It's, I, I, when I go there, I always tell people it's like 20% less douche bags. So like I never understand why people can't be that cool in America. You know, what era? One of the big differences I see like now like living in the u s and then coming here is there seems to be a bit more care in Catholic. I hear lots in the US. It's like, well, if he didn't make it, well fuck him, it's years and it's my right and you know what? Instead of being like, yeah, but if everybody's not doing well and your name, you're like fuck your neighbor. Well you know, if you run out of power and shit hits the fan, they need help. Well is it going to be fuck your neighbor then no one's gonna be like, Hey, can we help each other out soon?

Speaker 5:          01:48:16       Man, ambition is very good. But ambition without compassion is empty. It's nonsense. That's ridiculous. That's like not, that's not the proper use of your karmic resources because you know, you gotta, you gotta have like a nice community. You got to be happy when you know, when you're doing well and when he's doing well and everybody enjoys each other's company and that's why you, you know, you create a community. That's the whole idea is that we could all do that. If we accepted every one of us as if it was us leading another life. It's, you know all that shit. That's why we do legal man. Start thinking like that. Joe, we'll start. I'll tell you from listening to your guys' show from the beginning and seeing what you guys have built up, you and Brian, I mean this amazing community that supports each other. The other comedians when people are on you let them pull plugs for their stuff like and it just, you see how well you guys are doing.

Speaker 5:          01:49:06       I've seen when you guys had your first one it was snowy screen and now in the kind of people like I genuinely look forward. It's like when you had Ricky Ross on here. Yeah he was talking to us. It was fascinating and like I can't wait to see Graham Hancock. You old man. That's one of my favorite one 42 I know it off by heart. I'm always like, oh how dare you crazy. Have you been paying attention to this object and the bottom of the ball? Got It. Cause of you, right. I fall through like your, your tweets are the ones I looked at by most of portal, sir, because people deliver it to me first. I just, they know if they send me something weird, it gets out there. But that's, I mean through your podcast so people know, right? They know that you're doing that kind of stuff.

Speaker 5:          01:49:43       It's the power that you have. I mean, even just the first couple times you retweeted me when I was building my Twitter's like up a couple thousand followers. It's like boom, that people are like, oh, it's a union guy eating. And then it goes, that's awesome. Take the first time you retweeted me cause I'm like, check out this article. And you're like, yeah, it's retreat and my phone all day. It was like, Dang. I was like, what's wrong? I'm like, Twitter. That's when I finally got into it, I was like, oh, I see how this works now. And started going through. You can create a little community. Like, I mean for the most part, and this is not bullshit and almost all the tweets I get are positive. You do get a lot of positive. They're really nice people and you, you sort of can kind of cultivate that.

Speaker 5:          01:50:18       I mean, you're going to run across the occasional, yeah, well we, we, we ageable grumpy pants on a smaller level. We did that for the union. I mean, we got, we built this Facebook page with no money or anything like the studios have the, has like 40,000 people that follow it. That's nice. And you know, they always like when you know, right now we're doing, there's a real mean to it. Oh, excuse me. Are you should fear it's going out dressed like a crazy person just walking in on a podcast. What's up brother? Come have a seat, man. Jump in. Don't Hawaii Buddy came out. What the hell is up? But [inaudible] ladies and gentlemen, I went, the hell is that my man, my man or we met in Vancouver. All right. Hey, what's up dude? We this podcast over what the fuck's going on? Yeah, well it's nine 15. Yeah, we usually start at nine 30. Okay, that's cool. Let's, uh, all right. Sit down and join us, man. So you have a Kickstarter for your new film? Yeah. Just the culture high and they can find it at [inaudible] calm and a is this trailer worth checking out? Yeah, the trailer is really good. We worked hard on it. How could you say, is it worth checking out? Oh, I didn't know if it was like a very long and you know [inaudible] like four minutes, right? Silly.

Speaker 8:          01:51:25       Yeah.

Speaker 5:          01:51:29       Thank you.

Speaker 9:          01:51:40       It is a system which has conscripted vast human and material resources into the building of a tightly knit, highly efficient machine that combines military, diplomatic intelligence, economic, scientific and political operations. Its preparations are concealed, not published. Mistakes are buried, not headlined. It's to set as a silenced, not praised. No expenditure is question. No rumor is printed. No secret is revealed.

Speaker 10:         01:52:18       In 2007 a small independent documentary on bailing the breakdown of marijuana prohibition entered the North American Film Festival circuit. The unit, the business behind getting high would find itself accepted into 33 international film festivals. In the span of a year. The film went on to win numerous awards in Gardner critical acclaim across the globe with little to no support from big studios. That union stormed the Internet realm reaching out to millions of witnessing this overwhelming response. The filmmakers took it upon themselves to evolve the documentary from a simple motion picture into the beginnings of a movement. And so the union social networking Facebook page was worn quickly growing to serve over 35,000 active users arm with groundbreaking numbers on with many had said to be a dead topic. Distributors and broadcasters were forced to take notice five years after conception that you need in the issue of cannabis prohibition was launched into the mainstream. As the film is released into video stores, universities and media outlets across the world with new found exposure at the film went on to claim the attention of Canada's highest level of government as it was chosen to be screened on Parliament Hill in order to educate senators and members

Speaker 8:          01:53:32       parliament on the ramifications in marijuana prohibition. The rest is history. Now in the twilight of a public shift of awareness, the unions makers have set into motion plans to create what they hope to be the most prolific and relevant marijuana documentary. To date,

Speaker 10:         01:53:51       the followup film to the Union entitled the Culture High. Having had six years to grow to adopt new stories, new heroes, new villains, and an entirely evolved insight and just society and who we are as a human species. The culture high, we'll break down the boundaries that prevent marijuana prohibition from being stripped down to its very core. Are we at least effective when lost in the emotion of group mentality as the emergence of the Internet equalize that political playing field, the culture high, we'll raise the stakes with some of today's biggest celebrities gain access to previously unattainable footage and revealing

Speaker 8:          01:54:27       incredibly moving testimonies from both sides of the spectrum, the culture high as the documentary that will tear into the very fiber of the longest fought war more time. But in order to make this documentary come to fruition, we need your support. By August 1st we must raise $190,000 to kickstart the remaining funding necessary to produce this film. What we seek from you is not charity but the pre pledge support of your copy of the film. It's that simple. You prepurchase your DVD copy of the culture high for $35 and by doing so you will give the film the ability to be made in the first place. That's brilliant equation. Then you pretty bad. The film started saying it alone is like

Speaker 6:          01:55:13       the way to go for it for all these projects. This is a great way to do it because you have a great track record. Like I said, your first piece, if you haven't seen it, folks go out and get it and if you can, if you're not, if you're not fucking starving, please pay for it. Cause a Adam's good dude and it's a really well done piece and it took a long time. I know you, it was a labor of love for a long time. You know, I never thought about it, man. We did it and then it was a while after that before it actually got released. Like how long was it? Two years. We are done in 2007 but it didn't come out

Speaker 1:          01:55:44       till 2009 because we couldn't get a distribution deal. We didn't know how. Right. It was our first time. Now this time with the culture high, we already have a theatrical deal in place where we have to pay for it. That's what the gap and you're going to be in the movie movies? Yeah. Yeah. Like in America or Canada? No, no. America. We feel phase four films that picked up Kevin Smith's red state. So Ocean, Abraham, Lincoln, vampire hunter. You could go see the culture, how you won't get, we'll get only two days unless it sells out and then it will stay a week. But are you going to be able to go to like those mainstream cinemas that like play? Will they distribute like it'll be with like say whoever it's AMC or whatever and then they'll pick their certain locations. Does that work though? I mean, if you have a crazy controversial documentary like dark, does that get censored?

Speaker 1:          01:56:27       Nope. Doesn't get censored. I mean without the hard part is getting your money's worth. I'm saying does it get it censored? Um, it, does it keep you from being in certain like malls? Oh definitely. There's a certain countries that wouldn't even touch my thing because of its subject. Certain territories are just like, no, it's about that and Canada. No, not in Canada but in certain like there's certain markets like it would never be on Air Canada's flights. Right. I saw you. I wasn't sure if you said counties or countries. No, countries and territories. Right. Like if you sell certain parts of Europe, that's where I saw when the distribution game, I'm like wow, so they're going to be certain types of films that just don't get out there so that culture won't see it. Like they know if it's an action or whatever. Certain ones they just not allowed.

Speaker 1:          01:57:03       They won't certainly was like, don't even tell me that. I'm looking at it in like an AMC multiplex cinema in America. Yes. All the regular movies like the Avengers and right next to her, the colors might be one of the small, like say there's two MC GMCS, it'll probably be the smaller one and one and one of them smells like feet and that's the one. Yeah, all those fuck hill for a doc that's so hard to do. So, but if you do them like this, we're like what you guys have done, where you build this community that follows and you make sure that the few dates that they come out are targeted in targeted areas and the people go see them, then it makes sense. Well you know, this is also a community that would want to support something like this. So you know them being able to see that video and say, hey man, I would, I would love to get a copy of that and you know, have the pride and the, it's a, it's a nice feeling to know that you know, you purchased something that you actually want and you allow something to get made because of the fact that he purchased it in advance.

Speaker 1:          01:57:58       You gave like, you know, a, a vote of trust that just, you know, I mean, you're an honorable man. It's, it's a, it's a worthy investment. I know you're going to put out a good product, so it's cool the way you're doing it. I like it. I like it. You know, it's a, it's a good sentiment. Well, in our first eight days, we've raised 58,000 bucks and the town days. That's amazing. Oh, this support has been phenomenal. Like even, it shocked everyone. Even Todd was like, dude, he's like everybody in the marijuana. How much do you need to make total one 91 90 and you're already a, we've got 35 days to go. We're 50 almost 57,000 there it is right there. You have an arbitrary number of days to go on. This thing is, I wouldn't start or makes it, you have to do it because then you can just always be kind of accepting money from. Right, right. And then it's

Speaker 6:          01:58:42       all or nothing. Right. We have to hit the whole goal. Right? Or are we getting nothing? When you get the one I didn't. You stop. Pardon? When you get to one nine d no, you can go over, which is great. If we go over then we can put it into more theaters. Right. Their laws now on begging for money on the Internet. Do they have like very specific laws? Like you're not allowed to, you know, to fuck people over too much. I ask him for money on the Internet. Probably can't do fraud people for one thing and then just go to go to Vegas. You can't probably the fraud. Well that's the thing is kickstart as a good way that they have to approve your project and improving. You don't just get to put it up there. Well, you could also make a kickstart though.

Speaker 6:          01:59:17       Fund my lifestyle for a year. I want to live. If you did a good enough video and people want it to do, there's not just for docs. There's people that are creating like video games or they have a new watch and you pre buy the watch when you get it. Or I have a kickstart to make a new Kickstarter type kind of website. How long before, how you, how dare you, how long before these Google lenses, these Google goggles will be a subscription service where you can pay to look through someone's eyes. Hopefully soon. That's going to have technology keeps happening. How much would it be worth to look through Tom Cruise's eyes for a day? I would pay $1,000 you know some celebrity with sell that for sure this is a gay porn cause I would take a chance, take a chance. At the day I tune is a day he decided to just break his fast and suck her cock.

Speaker 6:          02:00:04       I would do, would it be nice if he could just come out? Wouldn't it be beautiful? That's what I love to be. Think he's gay. I'll bore at made funny when he was like, oh, I realized all these major guys are straight. Right. And it showed guys that clearly have reputations for plus. So weird man, I'm going to rock. Hudson was gay. It was like devastating to people and then afterwards it was like, oh yeah, of course. Tell you if Tom Cruise is not gay, that he is the victim of the worst fucking horrendous smear campaign ever. Him and Travolta. You've just become a part of that. Yeah, it's so, well, I'm denying that part right now and I'm apologizing for my ignorance. How do I know what the fuck he does a great joke about it, about Travolta, reaching out and grabbing that guy's cock.

Speaker 6:          02:00:46       What he says, he fondled his balls because at first he touched my ball. Then he reached out and grabbed my name and then what do you tap? No, no, no, no, no, no, no. And then minutes later, yeah, that's what he said. And then minutes later and then it's the fuck you talking about. Minutes later you're still in the room. You asshole. Can I just grab your Dick Norton was on the last podcast. He was fucking amazing to listen to what he said it was. I'm so happy that Norton exists. He's one of those guys. I'm so happy there's a Norton. He was so funny when he was going over his different perversions. I was crying, laughing. He's so entertaining to me. Like the way he's so honest about it and a blood, the way he like relish isn't like you're, you're getting to experience it through him.

Speaker 6:          02:01:26       You know, like how he liked girls as it just a little stinky. Just a little, not at, not a terrible smell. Just a little smell. A little smell. I like a little smell. He was like, he's so funny. I like, I like underarms. He like, he likes a little feet smell. He likes when girl's feet smell a little bit. Love Adrian. He's a crazy guy, man. I love him. It's so nice that there's a guy like Jim Norton, you know? Where would you be without comedians? Harsh. A female comedians. Yeah. If you were forced to hang out with the average folk, oh, you know, if you didn't have a guy like Jim Norton and your life, if I have a guy like Joey d s and your life, or, uh, I don't know, I would just be bored. You really ever stopped. I realized this recently. I've talked to this yesterday.

Speaker 6:          02:02:09       I think what it was like, I don't really have any friends that aren't comedians. Wow. I gotta to make some friend friends. I've Jujitsu friends. I have a quite a few friends that aren't comedians and I hang out with them or just attribute to oh well attributes. Well, some of them are hanging out with them and then uh, I have uh, some um, uh, pool friends put it just the fuck is I though. Oh, the Nazi's looking at you man. I'd see Nazi zombies zoned in on our Jewish friends. Oh, you should fear how rude with the Nazis. Zombie. This is creepy man. Imagine if that shit was real life. Imagine if that was what you had to deal with out in the streets. Just this Nazi zombies. It's fucking Nazi zombies everywhere, man. Trying to eat you. We're so lucky. We're so soft to grow or where we go.

Speaker 6:          02:02:53       We just drive around in our cars listening to satellite radio complaint complaint. If our Internet is not fast enough on her phone, whoa. We could be living in that. That movie. What's that TV show where the walking dead. Oh, dead. That could be real man as it could have happened 10 minutes ago. We just don't know it yet. They keep seeing, you know, do you know, I'm sorry? Do you know him? Yeah, we met once at a restaurant. Vancouver. Okay. When you guys feed Yack, Yack at that time. Yeah. That place is awesome. What did she call it now? They need just to sell it the fuck out. It's great. It's called comedy mix. What happened to your heart's fear? Pummeled that place. You have a chaplain? She's looking sexy. Always feels looking sexy. That's what happened. Zombie Hitler here. That's what happened.

Speaker 6:          02:03:39       The fabulous are we should fear. You're fabulous. It's fuck dude, look at you. You're rocking it. I love it. I like what you doing? It's perfect. Just go straight to nothing. I'm not fucking around for three days. Yeah. Do we need to hang out at Starbucks and just sit there and read? Have you been doing some road gigs, man? Yeah, I'm going to Ottawa. Where that you just showed in your, uh, your documentary. I'll be nice. It's beautiful. Then in the summer and get harsh. Fear will also be with me and Duncan Trussell in Calgary and I think that is was that July 20th July. It's July 20th is the date and then that the next day starts true fast, 2012 snap those IEPs, Calgary and shroom tech together, bringing it back to shut. Those will give you very different performance enhancements there. I expect everyone in the UFC to be on my show.

Speaker 6:          02:04:32       Every fighter must test positive or you're queer. Can you imagine if there was like a day that you had to do it as much of the fight, no matter what, but everything you do, the whole culture just agrees. There's only one way to get through this as a hundred percent of us have to do mushrooms on this day. That way nobody's vulnerable. Nobody drives around from the period of 12 noon to 8:00 PM there is no fucking activity done. Get everything you have to get done before 12 noon than everybody in the whole fucking city takes mushrooms. Wow. That would be amazing. A beam of light would just go straight up to heaven. Yeah, we would. We would all evolve a hundred years in one day, a hundred years. You remember how nice people were after nine 11 I like everybody was like, especially in New York, people were super friendly. They like jolted a, a bolt of humanity into people if they want it to be kind.

Speaker 6:          02:05:21       They wanted to appreciate each other cause they really did realize that, wow, we really are at war and fucked up. Things can happen at any moment right now. Just hug somebody and say you love them and be nice and be friendly. And this would be like disability the nation for a while. A did for sure. The mushroom day would be like that times a million. Yeah. It would be like that times and I'm not bullshitting if people who haven't in people who don't agree with me. The only reason why you don't agree with me as if you never done mushrooms, because if you did do mushrooms and you thought about it and you thought of how crazy it experience it was and how much it is a shared experience when you do it with other people that do mushrooms, drink shared experience. No, no drink. I just realize that you are doing the mushroom duck.

Speaker 6:          02:06:01       Any mushroom talk at all. It's true. I know that everyone needs to do mushrooms drank I think together one day it was not going to hurt anybody. That would be the greatest holiday of all time. One day. The whole population does mushrooms in the meantime. Yeah. 2012 July 21st 22nd or 23rd Shizam so the Mayan calendar was off by several months. Bitches. The porter will be open July 21st where will you be? Oh, we're doing a shrimp festival in Montreal. Oh Jesus Christ. Suntrust. What are you doing? Yeah, my Charles Cool city for materials shows Ari that weekend and then a bunch of other people do the mushrooms, the Canada ones. Um, I've got a couple more coming up too. If you want to do any more than I look in the other ones. You want to do a go, go back to, um, I'm going to be there at the same.

Speaker 11:         02:06:48       Sure.

Speaker 6:          02:06:49       So as Tom and Brenda, so you have a show at the same day that I have my show. I think they were around the same time. Do you think you could bolt over from one to the other and do both places? Probably. Would they get mad at you?

Speaker 11:         02:07:00       Long as they don't announce it? Hey. Oops. Anyway, nobody heard it.

Speaker 6:          02:07:06       Um, either way I will drag, can't get Joey up there, but I'll get to come regardless the hangout. Yeah. It should be amazing man. That a Massey hall is the fucking coolest old building too, man. It's like a, it really historical place in Toronto. It's a, it's one of those places where you find out other people that have played day. Like wow. It's just like, I don't even feel like I should be allowed to walk around here, man. Forget about actually go on stage. This is like a historical monument. That's how I fell the Parliament Hill. Like I thought it was a joke. I thought at any time they're going to come out and say, okay, we punked Ya. Did they laugh at my shit man? They loved it. They didn't laugh. They laugh and I was talking to yesterday leaving all my bad words, everything you played the Union for parliament in Parliament Hill and nick and the clip there were in a square room scored.

Speaker 6:          02:07:49       There was, you're a bad mother fucker. What's amazing? Me and Brett were just waiting to get attacked and then like, you know when we start talking about politicians and kind of the corruption, how it works, like Ooh, how are they going to, but they were giggling and laughing and they bow. They were probably all in the throat. Now Irwin Cotler probably all high as fuck outside there and I got real nervous. That's hilarious. Trust me, the building when you walk in, the security was worse than the airport. Like you actually picked up the titanium in my jaw. Wow. Right. So they were like, oh, BP to pickup the stealing your balls. No, didn't pick that up. That's, that's a new and a Menttium shit undetectable.

Speaker 6:          02:08:24       We had some drop that amazing that you pulled that off man. It's amazing that seeing that and seeing those people sitting there watching that video, it's really bizarre to me. You see my face on that screen is really strange. This does a strange thing. Trust me for us two sitting there like right next. I had an MP right next to me, three conservatives over here, senator art and cause I'm going to be honest with you, man, when you came over my house, you're friends with Todd. I'm like, Yo, who's the fuck's gonna Watch this. The, yeah, yeah, I'll do your documentary. It'd be just like all the other documentaries I did that nobody saw like 20 of those things. I probably said the same fucking thing. There's probably some dude he copies in circulation shit on the cutting floor somewhere from some other shitty documentary that I did where I said the exact same shit.

Speaker 6:          02:09:04       I'm so repetitive. It's ridiculous and it kills that subject. That's why you need to do mushrooms. If the world bitch it also, it also come, you know, it clicks. It's all in how you edit it too, right? Yeah. No, you did a brilliant job. Amazing job. You really got to put it together. Perfect. Listen, fuck heads. I love you guys. I don't really mean to call you. Fuck. I say that like I treat you like a treat us. Um, this thing's got to end at some time and then now is that time. So Adam score, you will see you sir are the shit. He did a fucking tremendous job. You took the ball and you ran with it. You did an amazing job. Pot. That's a good idea. Are you should fear. You did a really incredible documentary and I can't wait to see this culture high.

Speaker 6:          02:09:43       It's going to be bad ass. Fuck yeah, it goes to that. I ask him what we should do something from here. We'll do it. We'll do it a about the podcast. We'll do it. We'll, we'll, there's an interject. We will interject some podcasts footage in it and we'll promote it through the podcast too. I'll help you out, man. You're all spread the word buddy. Spread the word man. You're doing an awesome job of just doing that, getting that real information out there. The truth out there, and you know it's not about hippies folks, it's spelled fucking personal liberties and we've been co opted by. Shit. Corporations and Dunkin really give a fuck about you and we need to recognize that it's not patriotic to support that it's unpatriotic. It's, it's tough sometimes to buck up and say the situation is fucked, but the people that are going to benefit, it's not just going to be people like us that want to smoke weed.

Speaker 6:          02:10:29       It's going to be those people that are suppressing people too because it shouldn't be within the law to allow them to suppress people. It is in fact an injustice. It's a terrible thing where people are allowed to tell other people what they can and can't do. That doesn't hurt anybody else. And when you're doing anything because you have some sort of a financial gain that you're allowed to make some sort of a loophole judgment and make money from that, that's wrong. You know it's wrong and I know it's wrong and the sooner we get you off this evil tit, the better your own personal life would be because I guarantee you if you're running around out there making money off of keeping weed illegal, you're a con, you live a cunt life and you hate yourself. Okay? Cause you realize you're doing something really creepy and you're, you're stopping progress.

Speaker 6:          02:11:08       And if you in fact stopped doing that and instead embrace the psychedelic experience instead, take a fucking yoga class, go work out before you opened your mouth in the morning. All right, get your shit together, bitch. It's not our fault that we can handle it. All right? Step the fuck up and fall out of score you on Twitter. It's got a, it's his real name as s, c, O, r. G. I. E. But he thinks you're retarded. So he spells it different. He goes s, c, O, r, e and then a big G. Yeah. Just to emphasize, you are brilliant. You did it phonetically Gorgie productions, right? So that's your production company production makes it slightly less clever. Not because I'm a g, but just also it's it. It's only Twitter handle. I could get the other one I'd used on the union one by accident so I had to use that one.

Speaker 6:          02:12:00       Oh, so, but you still have the union on Twitter as well. Can they follow that as well? They follow that as well. And then also the culture is on there already and nice. Nice. And when, when he planted on getting this ball fully rolling with this culture high fall August versus when the deadline ends for the Kickstarter run. And then we'd go into production in September, our full production in some, well Brian and I hope to be a part of this, correct Brian, are we down hundred percent bitch and you guys already should fear powerful. Ari Shaffir please follow him. Smokes smuggles we'd all over the country. How dare you. We're not going to tell you all about me. And Ari does edit a new day to the San Diego shadows. How dare you. What Day is this? This Thursday. So Thursday, Friday. I will be there on Friday.

Speaker 6:          02:12:43       I do not know if I'll be there on Saturday right now it doesn't look like it, but I'll be there on Friday. Going to be there. I'm sorry. What'd you that American comedy company thing. I'm going to go see the comicon. Never been to comic con man. It's like Mecca. I got to go there before I die. Before the Mayans. Correct. Correctly predict because you got rid of the bureaus and your presence in our atmosphere. Do you believe in a, on an Aki? I, I've heard your theories about it and I got no theories son. I got to know the area. You see Prometheans yes I did. It was good. Hey Man, I did not think it was good. You didn't like, no, I did not like a man. People are split on that thing and I like, I thought it was a brilliant and moments in a thoroughly enjoyed it for long chunks, but ultimately as a whole I felt like you got to way too many cuts of shit scenes for me.

Speaker 6:          02:13:25       Fuck me with the fucking spaceship landing on the chicken cheese. Okay. Sorry. Spoiler spoiler, spoiler, spoiler. But I would see it again because I'm a retard and I love Scifi movies and Ridley Scott is still God. Yeah. That's so fucking Dork to say. Someone who's got really Mazi is God. You know Ridley Scott is God, it's amazing director. Oh, I'd love to talk to them about how, how he fucks a fleshlight. How'd that, how'd that, how'd that guy would love to be cuddled by the inside wall of the flashlight? Because Ladies and gentlemen, there is no better feeling. The love of your friends is number one family right up there. And then there's a flashlight folks. It's like the best vagina you really could ever invent. And if it just moves on its own, it would be too perfect. And that's all you would do all day.

Speaker 6:          02:14:11       You should be lucky that it's a manual thing is the lazy cunt that I know you are. You know, you're going to give it a couple of thrust and then you gotta throw it in the corner of pass out probably without even pulling your pants up. You sick. Fuck. What if I had a fleshlight that you know that the cousin and that would do that, like crawl over to you and oh yeah, that would be fabulous. Be found. Again, you'd have guys never leave right next morning would, but you would start feeling jealous or, or rather a, you'd start feeling guilty that you are doing this and this is no way to live your life. Just getting sucked off everyday by a robot and you'd go out and you try to find like the most religious girl possible. They'd probably completely ruined your actual real sex life because you will completely disassociate sex from being like a physical need. And instead it will become like this really heavy duty emotional thing. Fuck this shit. Like some chickens in the 50 shades of gray and you'll find her. And then together you guys could just slow kiss and you never come ever again. And then thanked the flashlight. You go to Joe rogan.net. Yeah. And even the code date Brogan and you save yourself 15% off the number one sex toy from Matt.

Speaker 12:         02:15:18       Yeah, I'm doing it all luck,
