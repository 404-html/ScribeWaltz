Speaker 1:          00:00:03       Hey everybody, I snuck up on you bitches barely let you know that we were doing a podcast today at all. So there's a lot of people on Ustream that are like the really hardcore freaks. They're sitting in front of the camera, the computer waiting for Shit to start and those are the ones that are paying attention right now.

Speaker 2:          00:00:22       We did. I didn't even smoke weed dude.

Speaker 1:          00:00:24       Be careful. The government is listening. This is federally illegal. Um, the Joe Rogan experience podcast is brought to you by several things. One of them is, does that me? Yeah, that's me. Of course I'm to retard is a Ting Tang is a cell phone company that we've been working with. That is a really interesting experiment in the way a cell phone company conducts business and one of the things they're doing is they have no contracts. Okay. Complete, no contracts, excellent phones. They sent me the Samsung Galaxy s three and it is the shit. I am using it right now. It's an amazing phone. It's on the sprint network, which is a, it's great for service. Joey Diaz raves about splint sprint. He's had sprint for awhile and I've been using it now. I really enjoy the big screen on this fucking phone and it's hard to go back to an iPhone. Even this little iPhone five, you silly little bitch with your extra half inch.

Speaker 2:          00:01:20       Dario, I might go to Tim because I got so pissed off at apple and they fucked my iPhone five order up and I might just fucking say fuck it and get one of these s three

Speaker 1:          00:01:28       dude, we'll hook you up. You need to get one of these. The galaxy s three is for looking at photos and looking at the web and looking at like videos and movies. You can't beat it, man. It's, it's incredible. When people send you pictures, it's like, it's almost like looking at a picture on a laptop. It's just so vibrant and big and the screen's amazing and the operating system is so, it can do so many fucking cool things go online. And I don't want to just sell the Samsung Galaxy s three because Tim has a lot of really cool, uh, different, uh, phones that you can buy. There's, there's a plethora of devices that you could pick up from them. And if you go to rogan.ting.com you sign up, uh, or rather a login through that URL, you get $50 off of any smartphone that you, you choose to buy. And they have this Samsung Galaxy s two, the Samsung Galaxy s three,

Speaker 2:          00:02:21       looking at your website. It has a little girl holding your face. Look, if you've got a Rogan Diet, look behind you. It's a cool a little girl holding my face. It's trawling. There's a little little girl just like, Hey, I'm wondering the Joe Rogan experience that welcomes the Joe

Speaker 1:          00:02:34       and listeners. Oh, that's so cute. And he saved 50 bucks and a here's another good thing like say if you and your wife and maybe even how to have a daughter and our son and they, uh, you know, you don't use enough minutes to, to warrant having three different phone bills. Well, with teaching you can all share minutes. So with, with three different devices, you can all be on one plan. If you don't use all of your minutes, they carry over to the next month. And if you use more minutes, it's just scaled your, your, your bill is a, is scaled. So it's a really fair way of doing business. It's all explained at, at Tang. And if you go to rogan.ting.com you could check it out. But you know what, look man, the contracts and all the stuff that you have to deal with, if you go through the bigger cell phone companies, they're kind of fucked.

Speaker 1:          00:03:26       It's kind of shitty and it kinda sucks for the consumer. And Ting is correcting that and they're correcting it with excellent signal, excellent service, really good phones, really good customer service man. They've trained some cool people and they've, uh, they've, they've set an environment at Ting and that environment is, we're trying to be fair. We're trying to provide you with a really good service and do it at a really good rate. And a, I love it. I love the idea behind it. I love what they're trying to do and uh, I'm, I'm happy to be working with them. If you've got a rogan.ting.com you can see all of the, uh, the devices that they have, uh, all the different smart phones and, uh, the different plans that they have and uh, no contracts.

Speaker 3:          00:07:53       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:07:54       Is this Shane?

Speaker 3:          00:07:56       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:07:56       Is it Shane? Yeah. Dude, you sound fucked. Are you, are you drunk right now? Are you covering an underwear? What's going on over there buddy? Okay,

Speaker 4:          00:08:06       I'm covered in a Mazola oil and no underwear.

Speaker 1:          00:08:09       Are you, you, you, you're very low energy. Are you tired from all of this craziness from exposing this craziness to the world? Is that what's going on?

Speaker 4:          00:08:16       I'm high or Dean, whenever I'm talking to you, I'm I or,

Speaker 1:          00:08:21       well, I'm hiring a gene whenever I talk to you too. So tell me what the fuck is going on. You are, you are premiering the Mexican Mormon war series on vice and the vice youtube channel. Correct. Tell us all about this.

Speaker 4:          00:08:36       Well, we went down to, um, to Allah in northern Mexico to do a story on Mormons who are fighting the drug cartels. The first people we met were the Lebaron from the Lebaron colony and now they, the Romneys, the live bands, the Jones was there. I went down from Utah when the American government outlawed polygamy. And they believe that, uh, because Joseph Smith said that, uh, you have to get to the highest level of celestial heaven by being part of a plural marriage. They said, well, fuck it. I'm not going to stay in America, not go to heaven. So they went down to Mexico. That's a good, it could be polygamous.

Speaker 5:          00:09:14       That's it. I, Jan is a beautiful wrap by the way. Got Mad props that Joseph Smith for keeping his giant hair. I'm strong. I'm sorry, go ahead.

Speaker 4:          00:09:25       Exactly. And I think, you know, Brigham Young had had had a hell of a lot of whys. I forget the, I think it was 23 but it don't quote me on that. But anyway, so they believed, you know, to keep going to heaven that they had to have many partners. So anyway, they went down there, they form these Mormon colonies and the colonies did quite well. I mean, they're, they're, they're successful farms. They have, you know, nice little towns and, you know, they're, they're, they're, they're, they're sort of affluent and deals. They're big tall guys and cowboy hats. They looked like a bunch of Texans down there. So anyway, we heard that some of the Mormons down there had been fighting the cartels because the cartels started kidnapping the Mormons and extorting them for money. So this one plan, the Lebaron plan had, had, had, had gone to war with this guy and then elevate key news.

Speaker 4:          00:10:20       Like it was one of the biggest bad ass, um, uh, narcos. He actually massacre 18 people in a drug rehab center just cause they were trying to get off of trucks. She's a very bad man and he lived eight miles down the road from the Lebaron colony. So they started going to war. Um, they, they, they forced him to release, uh, they're a 16 year old cousin who because of that, he got pissed off and he killed, um, you know, two of them. Uh, in retaliation and then it all went crazy. So as we were down there hanging out with them and seeing what they had done using antiquaries techniques from Afghanistan and, and, uh, and Iraq have checkpoints and snipers posts and all this stuff. And I were going crazy there.

Speaker 5:          00:11:13       What's going on?

Speaker 4:          00:11:15       Got Our connection, got wind of it where,

Speaker 5:          00:11:18       Oh, I didn't, it sounds fine over here. And we heard you loud and clear. Okay, great. So ignore that noise. Yeah, I don't, I don't hear it over here.

Speaker 4:          00:11:28       So, so they started making these military checkpoints. They had snipers, a lookout points and, and, uh, you know, military checkpoints and all of a sudden the violence died down and their region excepted continued in, in, in the rest of the areas. And so as we were hanging out with the, the, uh, the, the, the little barons who told us some crazy stories, the reason why the Lebaron we're ready for the, the, this, the sort of narco cartels, uh, aggression was because they were already armed and ready to fight because they had had a civil war within their sort of fundamentalist break off church. Um, where this guy named oval, a baron who tried to take over the church and he's also dubbed the Mormon Manson. He killed, well, he says he suspected and about 40 murder cases in America and in, in Mexico. And then they caught him and he tried to actually, he was, he threatened to commit Jimmy to kill Jimmy Carter at one point. And then they caught him in 25 people were killed after they caught him because he left his blood atonement last will and testament. So they kept killing his family. He had a 20 to 30 children, I believe from 10 wives and they were, they became as hip. It's acid,

Speaker 1:          00:12:48       they would kill people for him.

Speaker 4:          00:12:50       So they were ready because of this sort of civil war within their own family, within their own church. They were ready to fight. And because of that, when the Narcos came after them, uh, you know, they were armed and ready to go. And they famously, the Lebaron outshot the Mexican military in a shootout when they came to, to try to get the guns off them.

Speaker 1:          00:13:08       So anyways, when we were, when we were hanging out with the Lebaron,

Speaker 4:          00:13:12       um, they were saying, oh yeah, you know, you should go hang out with the Romney's. They live just across the valley. And when I called on the Romney's like, yeah, mid, I'm like, what? And they're like, yeah. Uh, George Romney, Mitt's father was born in a Mormon colony. Um, originally it polygamous Mormon colony and colonial the blind and, you know, went to America. You know, it's, it's, it's been reported that actually, uh, George Romney went to America illegally as an illegal immigrant or they crossed the border illegally anyway. And, uh, but they're still there. The Romneys are still there and in our law, and they have a comme une now there LDS or not the latter day saints there, there are sort of orthodox Mormons are not polygamist anymore. Um,

Speaker 1:          00:14:03       what's the benefit of staying in, in Mexico?

Speaker 4:          00:14:07       I don't know. I mean, that's their own, you know, they, they, they, you know, they live there and, uh, they have their community there and you know, that's what they do. They've been kidnapped as well. They had a kidnap things within their own family. And uh, um, but you know that they've been there for a while and they're like, well, you know, we're not leaving. You know, they have to leave. So what's interesting about it though is the Romneys are like, they're really nice guys and they're like, look, Mitt Romney should contact us because his policy on immigration is wrong because policy on, on, on drugs is wrong. They're like, look at, unless you decriminalize it, it's much like prohibition. You know, Al Capone and Lucky Luciano became big because everyone's still Jack as much during prohibition. They just, the mob Brian, it's the same thing with drugs.

Speaker 4:          00:14:57       So you know, it's, it's interesting to talk to them because they live on the front war, sorry, front line of this drug war and they see what's happening with illegal immigration and these are sort of big, you know, tough Texas died dudes who, who are, you know, pro Romney and go republican and all that stuff and they're like, look, you know, he's wrong and he should talk to us because the drug policy is wrong. And the immigration policy as well. So it was really interesting to hang out with them because they're actually at war, you know, every day. And you know, it's, it's, it's literally not even one generation removed. And this, the whole story is crazy. It's crazy what they have to go to down then after, you know, how they're fighting the narco is because the NAACOS control the whole area and these pockets of Mormon resistance or uh, you know, are, are the only ones fighting the, the cartels.

Speaker 1:          00:15:54       It is crazy because it's one generation removed from Mitt Romney. Guy was running for president and there essentially living like a mad max movie.

Speaker 4:          00:16:02       Correct. That's, that's, that's the whole thing. It's wild is everyone, you know, making a big deal about Obama's, you know, a history and, and, and, and everything. And you're like, hold on a second. Myth and history is crazy. They went down as polygamous colonies and the fighting, there's kidnappings and cocaine and drug cartels and whore and, and he, you know, he's just ignoring it. And so when we went down there, you know, we, we just thought, wow, what a story. And the story is crazy. It probably wants up today when we were doing seven plots and it just gets crazier and crazier as we go. But like, you know, internal, you know, uh, civil wars and murders and cartels and killings and it's just crazy. And it's like, you know, right. Just out to the American border and these guys had been living down there sort of in their own little world and now it's, it's, you know, it's just coming. It's just coming to the fore

Speaker 1:          00:16:55       crazy

Speaker 4:          00:16:55       story. And, and the fact that, you know, Mitt Romney is literally, you know, his dad, his dad had had to leave there. He, his dad came up from a Mormon colony in, in Mexico. So it's crazy. I know by the way, his dad ran, ran for president, but his campaign didn't last very long because they called into question his citizenship as well as, uh, his colonies polygamous past. So I think, you know, once burned, twice shy, I mean it is very, um, you know, he doesn't want to get into this obviously, and he for sure doesn't want to get into what's happening with the rest of the ones down there because it's a, it's crazy.

Speaker 1:          00:17:33       Yes. I don't think most people are aware of this whole Mormon colony. They're certainly not aware of that. Mitt Romney's a part of it. How is this being, this sounds like crazy information. Like it's, it's really, it has dark implications that this is being ignored

Speaker 5:          00:17:50       when you look at the media. I mean it's, it's really damning if this is like readily available information. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          00:18:02       Is Sort of Mormon, which I mean, obviously he's not sort of going forward with it saying, yes, you know, I'm a, I mean, this is what the Mormon church is and this is what it should be doing and this is what I'm doing and all that stuff, you know. But he's also definitely not, um, you know, he just started to sort of say, you know, my, my dad was from Mexico to try to sort of get the, the Latino vote. What's interesting is, you know, it was dad who came from Mexico and then did really well here, you know, is the poster child of his Mitt Romney for the dream act for, you know, if you come here and you work hard and make a living, um, then, then you can get amnesty and, and you know, his dad who was the poster child for it and he actually said he would veto the dream act.

Speaker 4:          00:18:53       So he's actually, you know, being incredibly sort of, you know, even more right wing than the they already republican sort of right wing party and, and uh, you know, there's a lot of supposition that the reason why is it's kind of like me thinks di does protest too much because he doesn't want to get sort of dragged into this sort of whole history because it cannot do him any good because drug wars and immigration and, uh, you know, kidnapping and, and people getting their heads chopped off it, you know, and, and history of polygamy does not a good presidential candidate make. And I'm, I'm sure that, you know, they're worried about the other and you know, obviously Mormonism has history and, and still some current problems with polygamy and they for sure want to stay away from that. But also they want to stay away from stories. More importantly, like the failure of the war on drugs, which has been a complete and utter failure. Um, there's never been more drugs in America for cheaper or better quality yet people are dying because we let the mob run it. Um, and it's just totally doesn't work yet. He insists on maintaining those, those standard operating procedures, sort of policies that just don't work. And by the way his mom and brother and but also his own flesh and blood is paying the price for it.

Speaker 5:          00:20:15       Well a guy like the scariest to me about written Mitt Romney, Mitt Romney seems like a robot. He doesn't seem like a real person when he interacts with people and that kind of like disconnected behavior, the way he interacts with people. So weird and disconnected. That's indicative of a lot of people who are really, really religious and I have a friend who went through most of her life being very religious and has recently fallen like over the last sort of decade, kind of fallen away from religion and is now starting to question her life. And one of the things that she said was that when she was really religious, she didn't question anything. She just sort of went along with things. She just, you, you, you become like indoctrinated into this kind of thinking where there's always someone smarter than you. Always someone who tells me what to do.

Speaker 5:          00:21:04       You don't ever question it. God has a plan for everything. It's like the same sort of package that it all went into in her head and I see a guy like Mitt Romney, I'm like, they can tell this guy to do anything and he's going to do it. He's got no spine, he's got no real opinions on things. He he, his opinions are based on what he thinks will work numbers wise and when he's communicating with people, he makes no connection with them. When he has these conversations with like regular folks who have questions for him, it's one of the worst things he could ever do. They should have never let him do that because every time he tries to be like a man of the people and gay marriage comes up or medical marijuana comes up or anything, anything that requires like real thinking, a real debate. He's a fucking robot man. He's a monk. A mechanical guy.

Speaker 4:          00:21:51       Yeah. I think he, look, he's the typical whatever it'll take to get elected. So He's, he's trying to be all things to all people, which just can't work. You have to be a human being.

Speaker 5:          00:22:04       Well, you understand this. I'm sorry, go ahead, please.

Speaker 4:          00:22:07       Yeah. What I think I'd rather, there's no one's perfect, but what I'd rather somebody who says, yeah, I come from this, you know, crazy shit and Mexico and yes, it's a problem and we have to do something to fix that problem because all of the money for the cocaine comes from pod and every other drug comes from America. The guns come from America. Everything like the market for all the drugs in America, but all the people being killed in Mexico. And you know, we've got to do something to help that because you know, I'm from there. If he would say something human, you know, that's, it's just like, look, you know, I don't want these people to be killed. You know, there's more, it's by a factor of 10. So 10 times more Mexicans have been killed or people, sorry, people have been killed in the, in the war on drugs.

Speaker 4:          00:22:52       And then in the real wars in American killed American soldiers killed him in Iraq and Afghanistan. It's quite a factor of 10 but it's after 10 the point you're like, look, this is a right on our board. It's going to be a failed state soon and it's all flowers and we just can't do anything to fix it. And what, I'd much rather just have someone be a human being and say, yeah, I came from that. That's where I came from and now I'm here, this is what I'm doing. But you know what, like people are dying down there. We've got to do something. Or you know, we've got to sort of look at immigration a little bit better than than, than we have been because obviously that's not working either. And instead of that, it's just the standard pat political answers that don't mean anything. And the no one's gonna do anything. And, and, and, and the same policies that haven't worked, you know, in the past 20 or 30 years, I mean, the won drudge is just like, it's a fucking joke and

Speaker 6:          00:23:45       it's weekend when you go down, it's weakening when you go down.

Speaker 4:          00:23:48       No, where do you go down there you like literally you cross over from El Paso, Texas into our as Mexico. It's the same city just divided by a border. El Pastor is one of the safest cities in America because it's a police state and the cartels live up there and you pass into Juarez, which is w w it's the most dangerous city in the world for journalists. And it was one of the most dangerous cities in the world, but I believe it's just been up to the most dangerous city in the world, uh, for murders. So you're sitting there going, how is that possible? You know, how, how is that the most dangerous city in the world is the same city as El Paso, Texas. So you know the whole thing when you're down there, you realize that this, we always say where all the adults are, you know, this is the absurdity of the modern condition. But when you're down there, you're exactly right. It's Mad Max five minutes out of the American border and it's not like we can just say, oh, so it was crazy. Mexicans. I mean all the guns are coming from us, all the money is coming from us. The market for the cocaine is here. Like it's just, it's all us. We're just saying, well you guys can shoot each other down there and we don't care.

Speaker 6:          00:24:55       Well not only that, there's documented of our guys are people selling guns to the Mexican drug cartels so they can, you know, quote unquote trace them or something. So they, they've sold them guns that have actually wound up killing American border agents that gets real mad

Speaker 4:          00:25:15       fasten period where there's been a bunch of, the most famous is the fast and furious.

Speaker 6:          00:25:19       How does that happen?

Speaker 4:          00:25:21       Well, they gave, they were giving, giving, not selling, giving guns to the cartels and thinking they could track them. And the only, they found them, they lost track of them all the same. They came up in a, in, in, yes, you're correct. In the deaths of American agents guns that we had given them. Uh, we're, we're using those murders, which has just, I found it to be shocking, but also there was, when I was down there actually two things when I was down there, the largest hall of ammunition, uh, got caught the, at the Mexican border, which we went to. It's all, all the ammunition, all the weapons coming from America. It's shocking the amount of like they've truckloads full of weapons grade, uh, you know, 7.62 a ammunition. But also one of the things that, that, that you know, is crazy about, you know, what's happening is the amount of killings that go on with weapon. Oh yeah. Sorry. The other thing was there was, uh, an ex CIA, I forget which one, but the ex head of the CIA, his ceremonial pistol is ceremonials 45 that they, they give you like, you know, as a ward and when you leave office was found on a narco lord when he was done. And so he had the head of CIA. CIA is a 45 caliber. Uh,

Speaker 4:          00:26:49       we're just sitting there and going like, now it's in the level of absurdity. Now it's in the level of, you know, fast and the furious and we'll give them guns and then they kill us with her own guns. And

Speaker 5:          00:26:58       it's a Cohen brothers can't at crazy in any way where I would think, oh, that's a good idea. Give them guns and track them. It's amazing that these fucking morons are the ones who are in charge of these things. The people that could come up with an idea like that, either some, either they're lying and they're making money and they're corrupt and this is just how they masked it or they're criminally and competent.

Speaker 4:          00:27:28       Yeah. Well, what makes it worse is the, the sort of the lead cartel now that they test. What happened with them is they were actually trained, the core group of the Vegas were trained by the DEA to be counter, um, you know, counter cartel, you know, super police. And so they were trained by the DEA and then they went down and then we're working for a bit, and then they said, screw this. And they sold themselves as mercenaries to the various hotels, famously the Gulf cartel. And then they said, well, screw this, we're just going to take over. And now they're sort of hedge demonic you cocktail. And they were all trained by the DEA. So they use the training that the DEA gave them to take over from the other cartels, and now they're running shit. And you're just like, holy fuck. I mean this, you couldn't write a Hollywood script this week.

Speaker 5:          00:28:24       Well, that's very similar to the who then became the Taliban, right? Isn't that the same thing that happened in Afghanistan?

Speaker 4:          00:28:34       100% then and, and so now we're fighting the people that we armed and trained. And guess what? It's happening now. We actually admit to it, we are arming and training, um, uh, Islamic fundamentalists in Somalia, uh, in an effort to fight Al Shabaab there. But this, these people who were training to fight Al Shabaab are avowed, um, you know, anti western Islamic fundamentalists. So we're doing it again. It's not like we were over, it's not like we're learning from my mistake.

Speaker 5:          00:29:03       Whilst while this is going on, there's all this crazy saber rattling about Iran, you know, I mean this really looks like, it looks like the end of the world is like knocking on our front door.

Speaker 4:          00:29:16       Well, I'm actually going, my next trip is to Pakistan. I'm the guy who developed a bomb for Pakistan, gave illegally, gave the technology to run. Um, I mean I'm interviewing him because um, you know, it's not only around having the bomb, but Pakistan, which is quickly becoming a failed state has a lot of, uh, weapons, a ballistic weapons. And so we're going to see, just going over to see just how loose the new, cause I over there absolutely terrifying. What's happening. What's scary about this though, is that, um, you know, the Mexico, uh, issue is Mexico runs the risk of turning into a failed state as well. But again, it's a booger. It's a, and by the way, it's a, it's a problem that we're causing. Like, you know, it's, it's, it's, you know, it's a scary time

Speaker 5:          00:30:13       and when they're bored or quits, if they become a failed state and they stopped having patrols on their side of the border, you know, we're going to have to, they don't have any employees doing that. We're going to have to up all the people that work down there. They're going to have to do something to try to tie it, and then they're going to have to go in. That's what's going to be really crazy. They're going to have to realize like there's an army of, of real it truly evil people that are involved in a crazy criminal enterprise and they're, they're billionaires and they have, and they're right there and they've become an army now and they're doing okay.

Speaker 4:          00:30:43       It's a joke, like whenever you're down that you hear all these stories of, you know, they're trying to build a wall, which is he'll, cause you just taught him a hundred or go over it. But yeah, will come sort of put up a wall during the day and at night. They just come and take all of this stuff for scrap, you know, because you know, it just, it's impossible to do. And if you think you're just going to build a wall and that, that's going to stop people from, from going under it or over it, you're insane.

Speaker 5:          00:31:08       Yeah. I just crazy. I don't know how you stop something that is out of control as the drug war in Mexico. It seems so crazy. It's like, is there even a solution that anybody proposes that makes sense to fix this

Speaker 4:          00:31:23       decriminalizing God's, I mean, this is, this is the, the argument is you say, look, it's like alcohol. You know, every, excuse me, everyone drank and then they, they made it illegal and everyone's drag but the mob, right. Um, and now you're like, it's not as if the argument that if we decriminalize drugs more people will do drugs is, is, is ludicrous because no one is not buying drugs or not taking drugs or whatever because it's illegal. You can get pot anywhere, you can get coke anywhere you get acid. Then we had sort of basically any drug anywhere incredibly easily. I don't know anyone that can't get any drug with a call of a,

Speaker 5:          00:32:01       yeah, but you run it. Can I call you up later tonight Brian?

Speaker 4:          00:32:09       And the thing is is like we said, there's never been more right.

Speaker 5:          00:32:12       Drugs in America, never higher quality and the better product. So the thing is is you sit not worried.

Speaker 4:          00:32:17       That argument, that argument is, is his mood. Like what you have to do is say, okay, people are going to do drugs. Okay, you have to decriminalize it. And that way at least you can regulate it or, or, or you know, that take the criminal element out of it. Because quite frankly, as long as people want to take drugs and I don't see that happening, you know the people are not going to want to take drugs to anytime, then the war will just get worse because it's billions and billions and billions and billions of dollars that is going to be run by the criminals because it has to be because the government won't run it.

Speaker 5:          00:32:50       I also think that we have an issue where the the people that are making the decisions for whether or not things are or are not illegal have a vested financial interest in keeping them illegal and that's something that we really have to address in this country. Like what you can make money off of and the fact that you can make money off of people being in prison and the fact that you can make money off of hiring more law enforcement and DEA officers and having more government programs to Radica drugs, the more money that you can spend in, the more money that you, it it, it beefs up this whole industry that all goes away. If marijuana becomes legal and all goes away, if drugs become decriminalized,

Speaker 4:          00:33:26       nothing happens in this country unless there's an economic interest right now, there's a massive economic incest and the drug industry. You know, I was reading a fascinating article, um, you know, the other the other day, about half of America is on prescribed drugs and the other half is on illegal drugs.

Speaker 5:          00:33:44       Okay.

Speaker 4:          00:33:44       You know, it's, it's, it's, it's there, it's not going away and either we come up with some sort of intelligence solution or it's just going to get worse and worse and worse and worse.

Speaker 5:          00:33:57       How is Mitt Romney is a guy that the Republicans chose? How did he get past their vetting process? How did they not look at this guy's past and go, Whoa, Whoa, Whoa, you're dad was from fucking where? How do they not do that? How do they not let just look at the Mormon religion in general and how people look at it as being a really wacky subset of Christianity with roots in the ridiculous, when you hear the story that it was created by this Joseph Smith kid who was 14 and found golden tablets that he can only read with a magic rock. I mean, it's fucking ridiculous. How did this guy get cozy? The Guy,

Speaker 4:          00:34:41       and again, you're right, he's sort of an auto bot, been preparing to try to beat, doesn't designated for his whole life. He, he, he, you know, and, and, and if you look at it, you just say, look, this guy, you know, it looks like a president. He acts like a president and he talks like a president. But it's like anybody like you, Joe, if you were to run for President Obama's running for president, they would find all kinds of crazy shit in our, in our past because that's human. What's interesting about it is he rejects all that humanity and doesn't want to say that he's from, actually doesn't want to say that this stuff was going on. Doesn't want to admit it.

Speaker 5:          00:35:18       Does he ever addressed,

Speaker 4:          00:35:20       because it's crazy. But at the same time you want to say, okay, well we should be electing humans and we shouldn't be lacking robot.

Speaker 5:          00:35:26       Has He ever been questioned on this publicly?

Speaker 4:          00:35:30       Um, I know it's come up a few times. He, he, he, he, he's been skirting around it until recently when he, I believe smoked this, spoke to the, uh, American Latino Conference and said, um, you know, uh, you know, I, you know, I'm from Mexico. I'm from a Mormon colony and Mexico. And also he said in the RNC speech, you know, my dad came from Mexico or to Michigan and that, uh, you know, we were more minutes, but people didn't care. It was more about the sports teams. We were like,

Speaker 5:          00:36:02       address it

Speaker 4:          00:36:03       because it's coming out. But the thing is that, to your earlier question, about 14 minutes too late is the reason why it has come out. So I wasn't the first journalist to go down there. People found out that they, you know, he was born there and actually, you know, it was an old story because it was a big story when his father ran for president and, uh, everyone went crazy. But, um, what, what nobody did it stay there. I went down there three different times. I stayed there, hung out with them. I actually liked them, you know, because they're, they're fighting cartels and the cartels guys, you, like you said, they're, they're in cities, people who are cutting off heads and then killing people at random and throwing grenades into nightclubs and kidnapping and it's just, look, it's

Speaker 5:          00:36:45       movie.

Speaker 4:          00:36:49       Then these guys are standing up to them. And then, you know, I, I respect that. And you'd have to protect your family and, and I believe in that. And I just think that, you know, these guys sort of doing it on their own is crazy. And, um, you know, when I, when I, when I was staying with them, you realize that this is, this is crazy. Like, it's not, you know, it's, it is like a Terentino's really. And, and you know, the fact that you know, he, he's his cousin, like they're all named, brought me. I mean, was it cousins? They're all there. You know, you'd think that actually this, they say this in the piece, they're like, look, I wish he would contact us because I think we could help them. And we got to talk to them about, about immigration. We've got to talk to them about this sucks balls

Speaker 5:          00:37:29       we can help and we want to talk to him about his drug policy. That's incredible.

Speaker 4:          00:37:35       Yeah. Well because they're on the front lines. They understand what it's all about.

Speaker 5:          00:37:38       We have to stop treating Mexico as if it's another thing that we don't have to deal with. It's right next door. I mean, it literally is connected. It is us. You know, it's, we pretended they're two separate countries. It's, it's so silly. It's just people, just people, and they were born a mile this way or a mile that way. So they're fucked. Now. They're not going to stand that they're coming across left and right back and forth. And we all know somebody, if you live in La, you owe somebody who is either family came here illegally and they came here and it's so normal. We have to fucking start treating them like they're us. Like we gotta, we gotta fix that spot. It's connected to us. You know,

Speaker 4:          00:38:15       if you're there for a little while too, what happened was because of Nafta, which was again, it was a, an American policy. Um, you know, Mexico, northern Mexico got really slammed because the farms, they couldn't compete anymore because of Americans still had substance use here, but they didn't have subsidies. They're all this stuff, you know, again, you can go into that stuff for a long, but basically Nafta, the Mexican, uh, ag agriculture. So they only had two options once, at least sort of agriculture died in northern Mexico. And that was either you sneak into America to get jobs. And by the way, one of the things that you learned there is, you know, they, these people are Mexican. They don't want to leave their homes, they don't want to leave their families. They don't want to leave their sons and daughters. Of the moms or whoever it is, they do it because of survival.

Speaker 4:          00:39:01       And when do you get your, when you're faced with survival, you'll do anything. You don't want to crawl under borders through rat infested tunnels. You don't want to, you know, put your life in the hands of coyotes and cartels. So you know, on one side they had to sneak into America, which is not a lovely process or they have to join the cartels. And those are the two options left to them for survival because of policies that were cooked up in Washington. Now I've got to say that when you say, look, it's, it doesn't matter what side of the border that's a, that's a, that's an ethical and moral obligation. But I'm on top of that is the majority of the problems of northern Mexico, a hundred percent caused by America. And you sit there and say, okay, it's not like Mexico was intrinsically poor. They couldn't feed themselves this, this all happened within the last 30 years. And, and you just sit down and say, okay, look, sometime at some point we have to take responsibility for what we're doing. And for sure the president, I just dates it has to have to look at this because, okay, we're worried about around where we're worried about this. We're worried about that. But guess what? Our back yard, we have something that's killed 10 times. The amount of American soldiers killed in the words that we've been fighting. So I don't know how it could be any worse.

Speaker 5:          00:40:08       And it just appeared over the last decade when I was a kid, one of the first gigs I did when I came to California for MTV, uh, in Cancun. I would never think about doing that. Now I'd be like, fuck that. That sounds crazy. But back then they would have MTV shows in Cancun. I mean, nobody was scared to go to Mexico. Mexico is great. People enjoyed it. A lot of great places to go on vacation there and then add a nowhere. All this violence started happening and, and mass scale. And it's, it's so hard for people to wrap their heads around. But if this was in Detroit, if this was in New York, we would be fucking terrified. We would be. If it was in Houston, we would be fucking terrified of this kind of violence. But because it's in Mexico for whatever reason, people don't think it affects us. It's, it's really nuts. Like there's a giant patch of humanity that lives in utter chaos and they are literally physically connected to us.

Speaker 4:          00:41:02       Exactly right. Because the, the, the increase in violence to scale up in violence in Mexico has been the last 10 years. And it's because they tried to implement the war on drugs. And not only has it not helped an iota, but it's led to a lot of people being killed because what they're doing and the policies is there, they're using just don't work. And the, the Zetas are a perfect example. Let's train a hyper group of mercenaries that then become the worst guys who are our worst enemies because we them, I mean the, the, it's, it's, we've done such a bad job. It's literally laughable. And we have a, uh, a series, we're going to be doing calls where all the adults, cause I don't know who the fuck is that you need to listen to lectures. Not at all.

Speaker 5:          00:41:45       Yeah. It's a weird place where at, where are the capabilities of our government have been overshadowed by their abilities. Like they, they can't see the, the greater impact of what they're doing and they make these incompetent, ridiculous decisions and yet they have the power to implement these stupid ideas and the impact of them is tremendous. And people who are more knowledgeable socially who understand, you know, what, what we, what we need to do to try to fix the situation, they're not being heard. We were all, we're only hearing from the people that are benefiting financially from the drug war and the, the whole thing is all based on, Oh, protect the children and protect people and drugs kill lives with nary a mention of the biggest issue that this country faces, which is the fucking pharmaceutical drug problem. There are a bunch of fucking zombies sanctioned zombies walking our streets and I know quite a few of them. I've met quite a few people in my life that have lost themselves to pain pills and they get them from a doctor and they have no problem staying medicated and they're gone. They are not the same person anymore. And this is an epidemic in this country and it's not being addressed at the same time while people are going after illegal drugs, which for the most part aren't, aren't the real problem in this country

Speaker 4:          00:43:07       for sure. I mean, if you look at it, you say, okay, we're talking mainly about pod and, and Co coming from Mexico. Obviously, you know, they, they do some, other than that, I'm going to be things like that, which is not great, but the, the, the, the majority of heroin, um, and with a country or in all countries, uh, over 90% estimated comes from Afghanistan, which theoretically we've been in control over the last 10 years and have them nothing to called the poppy, uh, population growth puppy. Um, and so what's happening now is there's never been one heroin, heroin in the last 10 years. A heroin use in American has doubled places going down. Quality has gone up, and that's what America is in control.

Speaker 4:          00:43:58       I don't know what anyone wants to talk about conspiracy theory or this or that, but, um, you know, if America and Mexico, Oh really? Okay. Fighting, uh, you know, a drug war hadn't yet, there's never been more coke or more thought. And by the way, heroin, just flooding the streets out of the country that we control it theoretically then, you know, somebody is not opening her eyes because if you look at it, if you want to take it down to its, uh, its simplest level America since it's been running Afghanistan has become the largest drug dealer in the world and the largest heroin dealer in the world. That's, that's a, that's a fact because, uh, you know, heroin addiction has, has skyrocketed in Russia, in, in, in, in Europe, in America, and then in countries, you know, that don't even have money for it. He didn't do the west coast of Africa and in, and, um, um, uh, India and Pakistan and Afghanistan and around places where they never had a heroin addiction because it's gone. It's on the trail. And by the way, this is during a time when, you know, theoretically we're supposed to be in there, uh, uh, regulating the country. Well, we're not, and I don't know why, but I get to tell you were always, a lot of people are making a lot of money off that airline.

Speaker 5:          00:45:08       Well, Shane Smith, it sounds like you hate America. That's what I hear when I hate talking like this sounds like you hate America. I do not know what I'm saying man. That's the argument against it. I mean, it's so blatant and one of the weirdest things is watching video of US soldiers guarding poppy fields. I'm sure you've seen those. That is so surreal, man. It's so, it's so like on your face.

Speaker 4:          00:45:33       America. I'm, I'm the, I'm the perfect example of the American dream. I came down here and, and you know, started a company and, and, and you know, uh, hired a bunch of people and I love the promise of America. I love the people. I think it's the greatest country in the world. What I don't like is the fact that we suck up so much propaganda. I don't know how it's different than Nazi Germany. Nazi Germany was doing bad shit, but they said, no, no, it's okay. We're doing good shit. And then I went, okay, and how are we different? Like this is the land of the free. We're supposed to, you know, we're supposed to have a free media that tells the truth and then we make up our own, our own minds. What I'm saying is, okay, I love, I love this coaching, but if I want to, you know, I'm going to tell the truth. And if if we're know complicit in, in, you know, doubling heroin addicts in America, then we have to know that if we're complicit and you know, 50,000 murders in Mexico, then I'm going to say that because otherwise if nobody's saying it, then guess what? How are we different than Nazi Germany? I don't fucking know.

Speaker 5:          00:46:35       Yeah, well we got a bunch of lazy unpatriotic motherfuckers running this thing because if people really were patriotic and really wanted to Spec the ideal of what America is supposed to be, there would never be any problem with freedom of press. They would never be any problem like what's going on with Wiki leaks this way. It would be something where they would want to take account and look at the grievances that the people have. But we're running by lazy people that they don't have this idea of the perfect Utopian society that we think that we can all aspire to and can be created someday. We all hope if humanity keeps evolving, that we're going to get past this ridiculous, uh, system of crime and violence and poverty and eventually move on to some elevated level of society, some elevated state of consciousness where we all can get along together and we basically can eliminate violence and eliminate all the bullshit aspects that are created by inequality and losers and doing a shitty job of raising children.

Speaker 5:          00:47:31       And I think that this is something that we should all aspire to. This is something that we should all look towards. And when our government is being run by hacks and dummies, it's, it's, it's a real problem. And when they placate to all these dummies out there that you know, form special interest groups and you know, right wing, crazy religious wings and it's there, they're all doing themselves a disservice. Everybody should be trying to move this fucking thing further than where it's at right now. And with rational discussion and logical thinking, you look at it and you go, okay, this drug thing is a big problem, but you got to fix this and who's making money and how is this? Where's this money going? Just knowing those numbers, the government should be chasing that down on TV. They should be going ladies and gentlemen, the Afghanistan, you know, opium supplies 90% of the world's opioid supply. We're in control of Afghanistan. So we're trying to figure out where the fuck this money's going. But no, it's just something instead that's never even brought up. It's swept under the table. Whoever is making money off of it continues to make money off of it and we're supposed to just ignore it, you know, because honey booboo is on TV, you know

Speaker 4:          00:48:39       it's true. This country was founded on a weekend, like a modern day utopia and you know, it's founded on the American dream and, and the thing is is that shouldn't go away. That should be number one thing. But it also has to be founded on truth. And the thing is, is what I tried to do is find truth. And what you do is you find that truth and then, and then say, look, now we have to action that truth. And I think if there's a lot more, I believe there's a lot of people like you and there's a lot of people like me up there and we do. We become disenfranchised because media is a big business. You know, we're sort of, you know, pushed out. There's only two parties in this country and you know that, I know that you're a libertarian. And I'm like, look, I think there should be three, four or five parties in this country. Because if there's only two parties in the country, then they're always in power. That means both parties are always empowered. And that's not a democracy. What you have to do is you have to say, look, there's a lot of people like us out there. We have to start by telling the truth and then once we told the truth, we have to say, now what do we do to try to go forward and not go backwards.

Speaker 5:          00:49:43       And when people have to understand his true patriotism is pointing out all the fucked up shit that you see. True. Patriotism is not just sticking your head in the sand and ignoring it because you're on team America. That's bad because these people are not representing what means America to you or to I what means America to you and I's opportunity and freedom and the place where you can. There's not really a caste system and you can really rise from rags to riches and you can really seek your dreams. I mean there's so many different things you can do in America. The the, the upside of America is fucking awesome. And the pretend that somehow or another ignoring all the corruption and craziness and all the things that turned it into a money grab, all the things that ruin everything. That's great about America where our government has been as become a, where people can regulate the flow of money.

Speaker 5:          00:50:29       The decisions that government make are all greatly influenced by corporations and when you see you connect the dots and you connect the the money trail, it's disgusting. It should be illegal. It should be eradicated for government from government. Government should not be about that. Government should be about the will of the people and the will of the people where they've sat down and intelligently debated every single situation. You know with the, if the United States government can have a real succinct debate with the American people about why we're invading other countries, that would be some fascinating shit if we could do that on television and have her, but no, we don't get, we don't get any decision making capabilities at all when it comes to that stuff. We just have to choose an a representative and then watch them do shit we don't want them to do.

Speaker 4:          00:51:16       You know, we've talked about this in the past as well, but when I went to the Middle East where they have all come to sell their weapons and they come to sell their weapons to, you know, whoever wants to buy them. You know, North Korea is about weapons. Uh, well for example, Siri, it was buying weapons. They're examined and they were using those weapons against her own people. Um, and that's sponsored by us and it's our companies, uh, that are, that are making those arms, uh, to, to, to suppress democracy, to kill people. And we just care about making money. And when I saw that, you know, I was, I was, I was bombed. But when I hung out with the Marines who were there as part of a, the, as part of the cell effects, they do this sort of that bad. It's the, you know, a special ops team on the planet and a force recon the marines were there and they're like, hold on a second.

Speaker 4:          00:52:10       These, these weapons are being used against us. They were here as they're just selling them like that. A model, this is what the fuck is going on. And when you actually talk to people in the military about that kind of shit, or using Marines to, uh, to be protection on, on Halliburton trucks, bringing like a six pack because they get paid per truck load, you just start to go, what the fuck is happening? I mean, if you talk to most people in the military who saw that kind of stuff happened in Iraq, they're there. They're there, they're disgusted. I'm disgusted. And I only heard about it. I didn't have to risk my life. Uh, you know, to do that kind of stuff. And then at a certain point you're like, look, when we can't use our military as cannon fodder, you know, did that, I don't know what the hell is going on, you know, with, with these kinds of deals. But you know, when we were at so effects, the marines were, you know, it made me cry. They'll tell you the truth because these guys came to the realization that American companies are selling weapons to other armies that are using those weapons to kill us.

Speaker 5:          00:53:16       It's such a fucking mess, man, and not being addressed. It should be one of the primary issues that our society deals with is where's the money going? Where our dollars going, how are they being represented in these foreign countries and what is the actual physical liability of it? How many people have actually died? I've never seen a real honest accounting of that either. Like you look at the innocent and amount of innocent deaths in Iraq and if it varies from the really conservative people but wring it into like a hundred thousand that's like the really conservative people. But the people that are really adamant against the war have it erotica million. I don't know what it is

Speaker 4:          00:53:56       tied together. It's over a million and you're like, okay, so you guys, we had to go and get what I'm saying. I'll compete with an evil dictator. But what about all the African evil dictators? What about Charles Taylor in Liberia? You know, did we get him out? No, we supported him. I mean like, you know, well, well did they have oil?

Speaker 5:          00:54:17       You know what? We need dude, for real. We need like real live Avengers. We really need like superheroes who are bulletproof. It could turn into the hulk and just go in over there and fuck up, you know like dictators and take, I mean really if science and engineers are working on things like that, they need to develop a real superheros. That's the only thing that's going to say.

Speaker 4:          00:54:37       I know that you just got your black belt, you to be our first superhero. Congrats.

Speaker 5:          00:54:43       Double Double Rainbow. Yeah. I got my black belt today from John Jacques Machado. Both of them like, no, no, no, no, no. Where one of them is like a symbolic in Nogi you don't really wear a belt, but you get to wear a black rash guard if you want, but it's a in John jocks. It's a GE class are we're a black belt, like actual belt. That's awesome. Yeah. Thank you. Thanks brother. As an honor. Listen man, when you going to be back in La again, we've got to have these fucking long, long crazy conversations that we always have. I know you have a bunch of other press that you're doing for this and you've got to go.

Speaker 4:          00:55:21       I love you. I love being on the show. I wish it could be there in person. I really appreciate being on the show, but I know you got another a guest and I won't take up any more time, but I love you. I love the show. Congratulations on the block.

Speaker 5:          00:55:36       Oh thank you.

Speaker 4:          00:55:39       I'm going to Pakistan and Afghanistan and Iraq and Iran and if I can get it to her and sneak into Afghanistan so when I get back I'll come straight out until

Speaker 5:          00:55:51       Jesus Christ. What stories you'll have. Holy Shit Dude. The feeling is mutual. I was a huge fan of yours before. I haven't met you and now I'm, I'm honored that we're friends. You're the coolest motherfucker I know and just keep going out there and doing what you're doing cause it's beautiful. You're videos are the best fucking thing that's on the Internet television period. I, I find the, the, the whole vice.com team to be that you guys are exposing the coolest, most interesting, most intriguing, the most baffling mystifying shit in the world. And uh, I'm honored that with friends brother.

Speaker 6:          00:56:24       Thank you man. We'll talk soon. All right. Take it easy. Bye Bye Shane. Shane might be one of the cools humans on the planet. He's fearless man. This motherfucker's just telling us he's going to Pakistan and I ran and I rack Jesus Christ son Jesus Christ. Sam triple you awake over there. Come on over here. You sexy bitch. Sam Tripoli and Brian Redman when my dancing partners this weekend in Sacramento, first of all, how fucking awesome is Sacramento. Sacramento's like one of those lost gems of a city that people don't recognize. You know when people talk about like cool cities to go to, like you gotta throw Sacramento in that mix. Sacramento is fucking bad ass. It's beautiful up there. It was weird flying in and seeing these crazy river systems they have up there and seeing all the farms and you realize like irrigation. Yeah, there's a big slice of California that is just farms, you know when you're flying over it and looking down at that shit.

Speaker 6:          00:57:25       Sacramento's interesting cause like I was, you know, doing the show and they're like I said something about every, all the MMA fighters and adult film stars come from Sag. They look good, Sacramento and it's like, it's a great city, man. It's like, I know you guys think it sucks, but it's pretty phenomenal man. Oh it's great. It's a great place to live. You're Ryan famous, cut a fat setup up there. He's got this huge gym and all that. A team, Alpha male dudes. And they were like, I love their setup too, because they also bought like houses together on a street. They call it like the block. I think that's cool. Yeah. And so they all live in one neighborhood. So like one guy lives here, they're like, I was across the street, which is what I've been wanting to do for a long time.

Speaker 6:          00:58:03       I think that would be the fucking coolest thing ever. And I've been stressing it lately with all my friends and we had an icehouse protocols here the other day. We all got hammered and we were talking about it. We're all like, we're going to move to Santa Barbara. Fuck it. We're all gonna move to great city, dude. It's a fucking great city. And what I was thinking is gigging there soon. We just did. I just did the Lobero theater there. How was it? Fucking phenomenal. Coolest shit. There's no standup up there. There's no standup. It's this great town and they don't have a goddamn comedy club. Well, it's really weird because it's a, it's a late, late night crowd. It's like you don't come out til like 10 at night. And then like before that it's really dead. I like State Street, which is their main street. Really? Yeah.

Speaker 6:          00:58:43       I've done shows out there. There's a lot of people in the daytime there. I've been there a couple of times in the day times a lot of people down there. It's got everything. You want a very intelligent and becomes like a more of a nighttime crowd. Like a nightclub type cloud crowd. Yeah, they'd be in all the good people hide that we're hanging out during the day, buying like little gifts and stuff like that. And then we'll just repeat. Nightlife goes in like two lost some colleges there and there's a very uh, intelligent population there. So it's like the perfect place for a comedy club. And he noted also is a lot of old Hollywood is there. Why was our soft Carol Burnett for Calvert? Calvert net fucking looks good man. She still looks good. She's like 79 she looked great. I was like, Holy Shit. That's Carol Burnett.

Speaker 6:          00:59:25       You know, there's a lot of like old Hollywood that lives there. They're like, they checked out and they moved up to this one spot. They all agreed to go to this one spot. I Dunno, I dunno how they pulled it off, but it's basically one of the fucking best climates on earth. It never gets hotter than weather's per gets like it's from 85 to 65 all year round. That's it. That's like the hole that's all year round. I like San Diego a little more like just outside of San Diego. But both those cities are pretty, San Diego is phenomenal. But what we were talking about, you couldn't hear because you were, you didn't have headphones on. We sitting back there, but we were talking about with Shane Smith was Mexico and how crazy Mexico is because of the drug wars. And I heard part of it. Yeah. Phenomenal. That's phenomenal. It amazing. He's amazing guy. But, but Mexico is right next to San Diego. I mean that is uh, one of the nuttiest things about this country is that La Jolla, which has some of the most beautiful homes on earth. I mean La Jolla is fucking staggering. Where that comedy story is the views. Have you ever like looked over at some of those houses and you look out in those views, you're like, oh my God, what is this?

Speaker 7:          01:00:27       When time I did a show there and these two drunk like cougar or at the show and they just got shit faced and then afterwards they came out, they're like, you get in the car. And they pointed me and it was this, this Bentley and I just jumped in like is bent. And they drove me around and they took me in this area and it was the biggest house I've ever seen. And it's like, there are some rich, rich

Speaker 6:          01:00:50       people in La Jolla. Oh yeah. Well there's also that core Natto island that's right there, that is apparently one of the richest places on earth. That's where Donald Rumsfeld lives. He lives on this island. Like they have all these castles and fucking, you know, billionaires lived there,

Speaker 7:          01:01:05       isn't it right after like Manhattan, it's like the most expensive lamp

Speaker 6:          01:01:09       per square foot, Coronado islands right up there. I think it's supposed to be like this really elite community have looked at some of the houses online and they are just fucking jaw dropping. They're like palaces like works of art. You know, like someone's just put tons and millions and millions of dollars into fucking, you know, big importing marble and all this crazy shit. And you're looking at it like, what a fucking house man. And then you can walk to Mexico. Yeah. You could walk to Tijuana from that. That's crazy man. You could get there in a day on foot. Just walking wild west. Just think about the old days like when, when countries, like when you really did like people did walk around like in the Conan the barbarian days, they really like got on horses or they walked from town to town. You could walk from La Jolla to Tia Juana and you could get there easily and a couple of hours. What is it? How many miles is it? Well, I think La Jolla is about like 20 minutes from downtown San Diego, which is about probably like five to 10 minutes from the, from the border, so it's like, it's like 20 miles. San Diego Downtown San Diego is only five to 10 minutes from the border.

Speaker 7:          01:02:13       It's like right there. Wow. Yeah. I took a wrong turn on the way home from comic con and I was going that direction. I was like, Holy Shit,

Speaker 6:          01:02:20       I need to turn around before I, I can't believe I'm going to match. She was Jesus Christ. Well, I enjoyed that American comedy company. A place that we worked out. It's a beautiful club. Is there issues now or are we going to be going back there? Sam Aaa that's going on there. I, I was a great time. It was just a discussion between me and him on the wording of the deal and the wording of, uh, what the show he agreed to him, what he actually got. And I don't want to get into it. Well listen man, we can start doing regular shows in San Diego. You know, we could Kodaly start doing that. We've got to do it to everywhere. Should do it everywhere. And Diego, Santa Barbara, wherever we want, we can drive to, I mean it's, I'm, I'm doing all these road gigs and there's a lot of shit that I could do around la too that we need to do more often.

Speaker 6:          01:03:05       But the comedy store, I'm in, uh, the, uh, the ice house, which is my new version of the comedy store. I can't do the comedy store anymore, but I do the ice house. I would love to see you come back at some point. Yeah. It told you that it has to happen. Certain people have pit by meteors and abducted by aliens. When we were flying back from a Sacramento, a woman sat in the middle of me and red band and she must've been loving life. But uh, she's from Chico and Chico and their Santa Rosa and there's all those awesome parties, cities that have these gorgeous theaters that they have nothing going on. Right, right, right. Go out there and do a couple theater gigs and make some great cash out there. Yeah. And you know, places, if you could do a show in a place like Santa Barbara, you can do, do a show in a number, a number of different places like that.

Speaker 6:          01:03:51       There's, they're all, there's 20 million of us here. Yeah. In La it's pretty nutty. And then there's all the fucking nor shit Ventura where nobody goes to, you know, nobody ever. When was the last time you saw commonly shown Ventura? There's a venture, a comedy, a comedy club. It's to a new place. No, it's, well, it's been there for a little while. It's, it sounded like a boat harbor and it's actually a really fun, I think Diaz told me he did that the das do that play. You got to pick certain nights cause he likes it really clean there. Oh, how dare he, which I don't understand where the exits, like I get the comedy magic club because that's kind of a tradition and it's Kinda like a thing there. But like at certain place to live, you got to keep it clean. It's like where does that exist?

Speaker 6:          01:04:31       Silly, this silly comedy, the idea of keeping it clean for standup comedy in that you're selling the wrong thing. There can be clean guys. There's going to always be guys like Gaffigan who are fucking hilarious. Who's clean or Mitch Hedberg, who's one of my all time favorites. Yup. And Mitch Mitch Hedberg was very clean, very clean. There's no sex. Very rarely swore. Didn't need to swear. You know, and if he swore it was like an afterthought, you know, fuck man, you know, it's, and there's not like a part of his bed. He didn't have to have the swearing it. And, uh, you know, he was brilliant, but that was his style man. That was what he, that's the way he did his comedy. And you know, the way you do your comedy, you swear the way Diaz does his comedy. I couldn't imagine someone telling me that Joey Diaz could be the same with Joey Diaz didn't square it because that's crazy.

Speaker 6:          01:05:15       That's crazy tight. And it's a stupid way to think. No, I didn't know Mitch Hedberg, but how he offstage was he that guy off stage? I'd, it's like usually how you are off stage, you should be that onstage to a degree, you know, maybe even amplify it. Oh, well he does. He was a regular guy. I mean, I only had a chance to talk to him a few times. I never really hung out with him, but he was good buddies with Stan hope. But I did get to work with them a couple of times to work with them at the store once and he was a good dude. It's just a regular guy. But his comedy was, uh, just, he had to such a unique cadence to it. You know, in a unique, sort of a really relaxed, silly, uh, um, observations on things. It was really fun to watch.

Speaker 6:          01:05:53       But you know, again, nothing like me, squeaky clean, nothing like me, but I still love it. You know, I think comedy is just who are you? Who are you? Are you Tony Hinchcliffe? Are you Sam Tripoli or you Brian Redman? Who the fuck are you and your comedy? Brian's has a lot of silly shit that I really would never pull off on stage with him, with his personality and his, it's like everybody has their own vision of what is funny and you can't say, you know, oh, inforce your vision, but do it with limited language. I want you to, I want you to not be free to say everything you want or discuss everything you want. I'm not saying that you should discuss sex or you know, or anything fucked up, anything controversial, but if you want to, you should, you shouldn't, but you, you, you mean it's not like you have to do it because every people have gotten by, like Jerry Seinfeld never talks about politics on stage, never talks about sex, but yet brilliant comic and it has this amazing career.

Speaker 6:          01:06:50       It's like you don't have to do anything. I can appreciate Stan hope and Bill Hicks. And then I also grew up loving Ellen. I Alan's like standup is very simple to me, but it's very funny and it's well written and I like to think that maybe that's her. I mean I, I've never really watched her talk show. She started at all. I mean, before she ever had a talk show, she was doing great standup. She didn't, you know, I don't think she had writers. It's all her. Yeah. Jeff Foxworthy. Same thing. Like you can, you know, give him that, you know, you might be a redneck, but like his standup is, I always thought was very well written and very fun. It's good joke writer. Yeah, he's got great. Some of you might be a redneck shit. Look, people discount it because you know they love to discount redneck anything, you know, but this is a lot of, that's good fucking writing.

Speaker 6:          01:07:37       So good. So popular it, it almost becomes like I have to hate it because everybody loves it. There's a little of that. I felt that it was a little going on with Larry, the cable guy. You know Larry, the cable guy I've always felt was a fun character. He's funny. I think his writing is good. I, I've, I've, I've seen some of his shows. He's a fucking good comic man. He made me laugh and he took a gigantic rash of shit, which I feel was mostly based on just people like, first of all, everybody has their own taste as far as comedy goes, but there's a one weird thing that people do if they have a certain type of taste. Your taste has got to be wrong. You know, if you're, you're, what you're doing is bullshit. You're like, you could, I've heard the argument that, you know, dice clay is homophobic.

Speaker 6:          01:08:21       Dice. Clay is a, is a, he's a massage and as he's this and that, that if you don't say that, that is a crazy exaggerated, exaggerated character that he's just going over the brink for the sake of entertainment. Like if you want to hold him to stand up, if that's who he is really as a human being, you're ridiculous. You're ridiculous person. I agree. And you know, if, if someone else was saying it maybe looked a little different, they wouldn't be so angry. It's so interesting how it's so much more the messenger that in the message he something that comes with comedy right now. Well, it's also when you're get famous and you have a lot on the line, like if, uh, like the what with Daniel Tosh said that all that stuff that got, uh, you know, everybody all fired up. If he was nobody and said that no one would have given a shit.

Speaker 6:          01:09:05       It was the fact that he's, the sky was this huge comedy central show. He allegedly said something that pissed some woman off about rape. That's, that's where the, the impact came from. The impact came from, he had a lot to lose. And that's this weird thing where we got in this country because immediately people were calling out for him to be fired. He should lose his job. But he said, first of all, besides it not being that big a deal, it was a, it was a normal thing to say in a comedy club. It also had nothing to do with his television show. Right. You know, and to say that, you know, he should be held accountable to every word that comes out of his mouth when he's adlibbing living on stage in a comedy club. You don't understand the art of comedy then and you have no fucking business judging it because you know, and I know that when you're in the fucking heat and bullets are flying your way and you're interacting with a heckler and you got, you got, you got to respond. There's a brief window of maybe a second or two after the word where you really have impact, where you have the instant correct answer and boom, you got to drop it on that bit

Speaker 7:          01:10:03       that you're going to drive Sacramento course. It did. I had to put some people in their place, which was really hard because the room is all black, so you can't even see who you're dealing with. Well, this is just, it's not that the real, it's the spotlight is super powerful too, and it's in your face and all you see is silhouettes. I have a big problem within this country and uh, with the whole notion that if you say something I don't like, uh, you have to go away and I can't, we can't disagree on a point. It drives me nuts. Like, you know, I, I, I'm a liberal guy and there's sometimes, you know, these conservative say some pretty wacky shit and then people want to fire them. I don't get that. Like, I'd rather prove you wrong. Then actually make you go away. Like the guy who used to book David Letterman Show, who said women, the Midwest doesn't think women are, are funny. That's a Ed, right? Yeah.

Speaker 6:          01:10:52       Uh, who is it? What is that? I forget his name, but it, oh my God.

Speaker 7:          01:11:00       Can't remember his name. But he got to think he got fired from that position. But you shouldn't fire him because he stating something that he feels he's learned over a certain amount of time. So what should they showed him that he was wrong? Um,

Speaker 2:          01:11:13       women are funny and if you think that you should have shown him, making him go away doesn't change. Eddie, Eddie, Eddie Brill, and he brill doesn't hate when that happens. My brain sucks. That's where I'm saying to take Alpha ran today. Yeah. If your brain is broken down, I wonder if Alpha brain and we'd just cancel each other.

Speaker 5:          01:11:33       No, not to me. No. No. I definitely have a, an impact whether I take it, I don't take it.

Speaker 2:          01:11:39       Cause you remember, do you remember when you first started smoking weed and, uh, the next morning you'd wake up and you're like, wow, man, I'm my head. I'm still fucked up from that. We, last night I flew foggy and then that just kind of went away.

Speaker 5:          01:11:54       No, I mean I think everybody's body processes things differently. You know, my body's always processed. We'd where for whatever reason, the next day I was fine. Really? Yeah, I'm fine in a few hours my body goes through a pretty quick.

Speaker 2:          01:12:06       I remember I used to be a big thing when I first started smoking weed and how it like almost lasted they the next day where I felt my brain just not being as clear.

Speaker 5:          01:12:15       People don't know how deep we go sometimes too. Sometimes we get so high, it's just Dunkin and I. The other day we talked about it on his podcast, we had a great podcast that we did together. The Duncan Trussell family hour. You get a download it from, you can find it, go online and figure it out. UH, T R U s s e l l, but we got Super Bazooka, Bazooka Ud, and then we went to Costco and it was my first time going to

Speaker 2:          01:12:37       [inaudible]. Have you ever been to any kind of thing like that before? I don't think I had,

Speaker 5:          01:12:41       I don't think I had, I might've been to something that long, long, long time ago. And it didn't mean anything to me because I was probably sober when I was there. But to go through high was like, we were totally fear and loathing in Las Vegas and get him and I were like, weird shit. Oh, we were so baked with, isn't it? We had no business out in public, no business cause we, uh, we're about to do a podcast together and uh, we were, first of all, I was very happy because Dunkin and Brian had finally made up and all this craziness of two of my best friends, uh, at war with each other. It was fucking nonsense. And it lasted for so long. It was really stressful. But, uh, thankfully it all worked out and so we were super psyched. So we just got deep, deep, deep, deep, deep into the hole.

Speaker 5:          01:13:22       We just kept going at it. We kept killing this joint and they were like, oh my God, we're too high. We're too high. We walked down to the Costco and I forget what we were trying to get. Oh, you have 82 paper towels in your car? No, I didn't get anything. Well, you know why we didn't get anything because that's what happened. We went down there to get a grill and they don't sell grills will after September it was 110 fucking degrees outside after September. And they were like, well that's a seasonal item. I go, Whoa, Whoa, whoa. Fucking barbecue grill is seasonal in la when it's always warm. I use my grill year round. I love barbecuing. I think like barbecuing steak on the grill. It for me, it lights up some caveman shit that I have for, you know, they say dudes have like neanderthal in them for, I got champion me, dude. I have some DNA

Speaker 6:          01:14:12       that came from the first champ that figured out how to start a fire by banging rocks together. And so I good dude, I can't take that shit. And when I uh, when I get like a primal satisfaction over like grilling steaks, like it's, so it's a creepy thing. Blood pumping. Like, if anybody else in my family wanted to cook the steaks, I be like, fuck is wrong with you. Back the fuck off. My crazy. Are you crazy? You don't know how to fucking cook a steak on a grill. You're going to fuck this experience up. I got it down where I have an iPhone, a s a stopwatch thing and know exactly how long I know exactly. I know how many I use these little charcoal chimneys. You ever seen those things? Well the um, you know, when you get let go a Weber grill, you know those Weber grills is all you need.

Speaker 6:          01:14:59       But those Weber grills, they also sell these Webber, charcoal chimneys and you stuffed like some ripped up, uh, like a trash bag or something. Oh, well some paper on the bottom it looks like a flour sifter. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And then you pour the charcoal in it and light a fire on the bottom and it cooks it all the way through the tops of the coals or like white hot. You lay those pitches down and know exactly how high the grill is. And I let it sit on that grill for five minutes. I let that grow, get stupid hot and then I know exactly how much the time based on how thick the steak is based on how much it's, how much. What's your favorite steak? Because I, I hear Bobby flay and then I just went with the, uh, what's the one that has to fillet and the other state together to help for health reasons and tastes reasons.

Speaker 6:          01:15:41       There's two different, I have to say, it's two different things I like. I love the taste of grass fed rib eyes. It's a different taste. It's more meaty or a more gamey rather. It's almost like a buffalo or a like, it's a weird, it's more a game animal because what we don't realize is that we're feeding cows shit they're not supposed to be at. That's why I just, I don't know man. I know you gave me shit about one become a vegetarian and I don't, but I just don't like the way we're raising animals right now. It just doesn't seem, I agree. Well, you can raise them grass fed, you can buy grass fed meat. And we're actually, we're having a guy in on the podcast a in the future, uh, the guy from the who who wrote the bulletproof executive, uh, Dave Asprey, he's coming on the podcast soon and he's going to explain all of this shit for us.

Speaker 6:          01:16:26       And, uh, that's a, that's a, that's much needed because a, I don't understand like what, you know, how how much of an effect, uh, grass fed meat has on you as opposed to corn fed. But apparently it's pretty fucking Substan I'm sure it is. Yeah. Apparently it's substantial, not just with the meat but with the milk. If you drink milk from grass fed animal and a, and even a cheese and butter from, uh, from grass fed cows is better for you, which is really kind of nuts. But the corn, uh, in this country, corn is a gigantic crop and they try to use it for everything. Everything now and the price of corn is skyrocketed. But also people like the way corn fed beef tastes because it gets so fatty. You. There is really an argument for the how delicious, uh, corn fed rib eye is because they're fucking substantial.

Speaker 6:          01:17:14       You get a fast corn fed ribeye and cook it over some mesquite wood. Oh son. Big uh, big griller is Michael favor men. Oh, my shaman is a chef's amazing mother fucker Bro. Yeah, he's a bad motherfucker. Some of the best steak I've had in awhile as his stake. Yeah. Favorite mins. A bad motherfucker. We, we've talked about, uh, him like we should have an event here and have him cook here. All that would be, that'd be fucking bad ass man. That'd be totally bad ass. And he could do stand up to hold the grill. He's going to do 10 minutes. He's got, if he's done a podcast, I know he's looking to do something. We should be, he should ask casking show. No cooking guys like Faber and faber mins. Uh, guys, guys, big meaty motherfucker. And he's fast too. He's really funny. So that's one of my favorite people to gigs with.

Speaker 6:          01:18:03       So he's a great guy. He's a fun guy to talk to too. He has crazy fees. Old Score comedy store. He's been around there forever. Yeah. We've known favor men since the, it was the 90s, I think. First met fame, wasn't it like eight days working a lot when I got picked up and that was about 99. Well we went to his place after September 11th. We were watching all the shit go down on TV from favorites house. I got pictures of me and Diaz and Ralphie May and yeah, we were baked. Baked is fuck hanging out of favor. Brent's place watching the guys who were high as fuck. Ugh, ag lasted well. That was, um, she got a high back then. I didn't know you got high that long ago. Yeah, I was going to say that was about a year after I started smoking weed. I started smoking weed at 2000.

Speaker 6:          01:18:48       I remember that too. Yeah. Round 2099, maybe 99, 2000, somewhere around then. And then, um, right after that, September 11th happened. So maybe it was my fault, man. I fucked reality up with my thinking man. After right around September 9th I started, I just can't watch television because everything's just a wreck. Reenactment of that crazy ass shit was um, those attacks on the, um, the American embassies. What Day did those take place? September 11th date for. So they did it. They did it like on purpose symbolically on that day. That guy who put out that video. I mean there's so much bullshit with that video. First of all, it looks to explain what you're talking about for people to love them. Video. Ah, innocence of Muslims that came out. Yeah, I think it's, it's on youtube. It's so poorly done and it's like everybody's in blackface or this is more brown face cause they're playing Muslims. It's so stupid. Like I can't believe that people went back crazy over something that dump, like give, if Steven Spielberg came out with something that was well executed, I can understand why. So we would go, no, I really can't even understand that. But I can understand if it was done well, this is so poorly done. You know, there's the really crazy, uh, I shouldn't say crazy, but conspiracy inclined folks think this is a CIA job. And they think that the CIA

Speaker 1:          01:20:08       is doing this to a rally up these, uh, American enemies so that we're forced to go to a war against Muslim countries and we can justify a war against Iran or, or anybody else. And uh, that, that that's the reason why they think this thing got so popular so quickly. Because before I even knew about this film, they were already bombing us embassies. Like they just immediately went to rocket attacks. And I was like, how did they find out about it? I mean, what kind of Twitter account did they have? You know, I have 800,000 people on my Twitter account and I didn't find out about it until someone shot a rocket into an embassy. You know, how are these people, how, how was that information distributed so quickly? And then how is this organized so quickly where people just immediately are protesting it? Like you've all seen it.

Speaker 1:          01:20:51       Yeah. You all got together and saw it. I'm not sure that that's how viral that video was. It seems to me like, man, if I wanted to, to look at the past of like some of the shit that America has done, like the Gulf of Tonkin incident and all the different things that we've done to try to get us into war. And I understand that that's happened. That has happened. It's fact. There's no getting around it. It's a hundred percent fact. The Bay of pigs, that's a fact too. You know, the Northwood operation, Northwoods, that's a fact. There's a lot of crazy facts about like about war. So if you want it to really piss off Muslims and get them to do something stupid, what's really ridiculous as all you have to do is make a depiction of their guy, make a depiction of this Muhammad character. And you could do it as a CIA cycop cyop or you know, whatever they call it.

Speaker 1:          01:21:38       The one of the woman who was on the show and actress Cindy Lee, she claims that her voice was dubbed and she says that, um, uh, who she has a role in the controversial low budget film titled The innocence of Muslims, which has sparked riots against the u s in the Middle East. I mean, this is like some shit out of a fucking movie. This movie is some shit out of a movie. And she's saying, she says, yeah, exactly. The act, the act more than that, more, more crazy than that. The actors were deceived. A Garcia told the Hollywood reporter, my voice was dubbed and I wasn't, it wasn't even my voice. I had no idea he did that until the trailer came out. My only part was the role of a mother talking to her husband, her daughter, and this man named master George in the film.

Speaker 1:          01:22:21       Uh, Garcia plays the mother of a 12 year old girl who is set to marry the Prophet Muhammad. Whoa. Garcia is heard. Insulting Mohammed, asking her husband if Muhammad was a child molester because uh, her daughter is but a child and he's 55 years old. Wow, this is crazy. So they put all that into her mouth after it was. This is, it's very possible that this is like some CIA shit, a lot of money trying to just trying to rile these motherfuckers up to give us an excuse to start going in there. And this is how it starts. Rocket attacks on embassies is step one. It's a real weird to listen to General Wesley Clark talk about all this stuff in like 2000 and it was 2004 or 2008 he basically, Brian can you pull that up please? A General Wesley Clark predicts a u s tax. Maybe.

Speaker 1:          01:23:17       I can't believe that. You know, we got to stop calling it military defense and just start calling military off fence cause that's what it seems to be now. We're just always on the offensive man and it never seems to work out. Yeah. The plan. Look up General Wesley Clark and it says, reveals US plan to invade Iraq and this guy, I forget what year this was, that he uh, did this interview, but he basically outlines everything that's happening today. Okay. It was 2007 he outlined this, join me, better me and join me in more this, enjoy this big jerk off this lotions are sponsoring this very important message. Jerk off. Lotions are so critical to a good masturbate. It's this here. No, no, no. You got, you're watching movies on general. Wesley Clark reveals US plan. If you just, just type general and Clark and youtube. Yeah, that's exactly it. And democracy now hit the, hit the volume. He says,

Speaker 8:          01:24:16       we've made the decision. We're going to war with Iraq. Oh, I came back to see him a few weeks later and by that time we were bombing in Afghanistan. I said, are we still going to war with Iraq? And he said, oh, it's worse than that. He said he reached over on his desk. He picked up a piece of paper. He said, I just, he said, I just got this down from upstairs mean separate events office today. And he said, this is a memo that describes how we're going to take out seven countries in five years starting with Iraq and in Syria, Lebanon, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and finishing off Iran

Speaker 1:          01:24:49       is, and there's no, you wrap your heads around that. Wrap your heads around that. Ladies and gentlemen, this is General Wesley Clark in 2007 describing the u s plan to invade Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and I ran and that these are all areas where shit is going down. Um, especially like what just happened in Libya. Look what's going on. I mean that's where the a US embassy was bombed as in Libya. Somalia is of course a hotbed of piracy. There's always some crazy shit going on in Somalia, which by the way, uh, I don't necessarily blame the Somalians at all. If you go and look up their history and look up what they call the volunteers, what do they call the voluntary coast guard of Somalia? I think that's what they call themselves. They started kidnapping people because they were kidnapping European ships who are dumping poison. It's their waters. Their waters were completely polluted and they are like a fishing culture. And so they started going out and kidnapping these Europeans. But then it became like much more profitable to kidnap people. Then it was to fish because they fucking polluted the shit out of that water. They dump toxic waste right off their ocean. It's just the fishing population

Speaker 6:          01:26:04       that's just horrible. Yeah, it's crazy shit. So these people really went full on Desperado. Like it was created by greed. The Somalian problem was created by green and that seems to be the biggest problem with a lot of the decisions be made. One thing that scares me about the military right now and is that how many people are in charge of the military that never were in the military? Right. You know, it's chicken. It's very easy to be like, you know the talk game about punching people in the face if you've never been punched in the face, you know, it's like if you've been punched in the face, you think twice about starting a fight. Cause you know the air hurts, right? And you know what you can do to somebody if you know how to fight. And you know when you can do to somebody and you don't want someone doing that to you.

Speaker 6:          01:26:45       You know, you're like, whoa Nelly, you know, I had a conversation with a dude is like, ah, I could have kicked that guy's a, you know, he's talking shit. I could have kicked his ass. I'm like, how do you know he could have kicked his ass? You don't know anything about that guy. I know some little dudes that can fuck you up. You know? And people who run around thinking that they could just get in fights, fights, fights are fucking terrible. It's never a good thing to get in a fight. I think this is the first election ever were both guys running for the presidency. I think neither don't have military backgrounds. And I think that's like such an interesting thing that you're putting the guy in charge of the military that's never actually had any military experience. That's interesting. Is that the case? Well currently than Clinton went against George Bush senior military.

Speaker 6:          01:27:30       Well he was CIA and yeah, he was military World War Two flu. Yeah. I mean, but he was a, not just military, he was actually a part of the intelligence community and the head of the CIA, Reagan was military. What was I saying? He, I think he flew to, or he, I know he was something in the military and of course George Bush Jr was like all the craziness of it is national guard. Cub Scouts. Yeah. He went, he went fishing once. He was in a weird situation. But then again, um, well who was the opposing McCain? Yeah. Mccain. Mccain was running for president and he was obviously a war hero. Yeah. It's kind of interesting. These are the first two guys against a guy who married the ketchup Eris who was the guy, uh, that they actually somehow made him look bad. Uh, who was the guy that Bush ran against the, uh, second, first term was Al Gore.

Speaker 6:          01:28:21       Second Term John Kerry. John Kerry. Oh, did you say, I thought you said John McKay my bad? No, no, no. I said Mccain was the guy who, uh, Obama went again. Yeah. So I think this is the first time we've had two guys who have no military background at all. Yeah, no, I think you're right. John Kerry was a military. Obviously the whole swiftboat thing was ridiculous. Won't carry, probably should have won. You know, who knows how much fuckery was going on with that. Go go watch on TV or on Youtube. Go look up hacking democracy. It's one of the craziest documentaries I've ever seen about those voting machines and how easily they could change the votes. And I don't understand why people don't think that this is at all possible. Come on when that much money is at stake, people do some shady shit. There's so much money at stake, we can't even wrap our head around it and people become addicted to all this money.

Speaker 6:          01:29:10       It's just like I was talking about earlier with Shane Smith, the, the idea that the, uh, the, the whole criminal system is a, a profitable system for a lot of people. There's a lot of people who get contracts, you know, for us to hire new security guards. And there's a lot of people that run private prisons in California, everywhere, man, everywhere. This is look, this jobs to be had in keeping drugs illegal. The real thing is you just got to figure out how to, how to make something that replaces those jobs with something that's actually good for people instead of arresting kids for pot. You know, there's gotta be a way to do that where you're figuring out how to use all these people and you don't, you don't take them out of work. He just give them something productive to do instead of being fucking crazy.

Speaker 6:          01:29:53       Uh, you know, anti-drug Crusaders. I mean, the whole thing about these stabilizing regions too, you see that going on right now in Mexico. Like we are de stabilizing that whole area for whatever reason. I don't know either cheap labor or lower, there's this whole, you ever hear the, the marrow, that whole conspiracy theory about trying to turn like Canada, America and Mexico into one kind of one, I don't know. Groups so that they all have the same denomination. Yeah. It didn't someone talk about that on CNN. Yeah. And then they were talking about how they did that with the euro, but it's crumbling. The euro right now it's like cause all the different countries at different economic schemes going on and they can all support each other and it's, it's just really interesting. But there's that whole saying that they're trying to, you know, make Mexico so poor that they need us to join in and then we make everybody like the marrow.

Speaker 6:          01:30:49       It's like this whole, and then when you do that you get rid of the US Constitution. That's the whole, that whole conspiracy theory about that. Yeah, it was, Jack wasn't a Jack Cafferty who was on CNN who actually brought up that. But I think that's proven to be like Obama actually addressed that. And running for president. He said there's no evidence of that. Well, that's what he's going to sell. Well, I mean, do you really think that they're, they're destabilizing Mexico on purpose. Do you think that that's what's going on and that the idea is to just combine everything, destabilize it so we have a reason to combine with it and then just take it over really a whole bunch of theories about that one. Yeah. But the stabilizing, it's easier to, you know, it's easier to deal with something when you're paying. If you're saying that these drug cartels or have us, us, uh, our firearms, it's easier to pay off the cartel than it needs to pay off an entire Mexican government.

Speaker 6:          01:31:39       Do you understand what I'm saying? Yes. It's much easier to pay off one guy then pay off a whole group of people. Yeah. Yeah. It's, it, the whole thing is very interesting. And if that's really how they've organized it, that they've decided to d stabilize Mexico, what are they going to do to Canada and get them to join because the Canada's economy's great. The people were fucking coolest shit. They're the, you know, like how are they gonna how are we going to make them hop on the Amiro the only thing that could make this as Canadians are so god damn agreeable, they might just join up anyway. Alrighty. Where I guess we all have the same money. Canada is phenomenal. I'm very excited about going there this week. We're going to have a good time at Toronto this week and uh, I'm, I'm really sorry. I've, I keep hearing all these stories about people that are trying to buy tickets and then they buy them online.

Speaker 6:          01:32:23       Uh, the only ones that are available are from these disreputable places that are charging like a stupid stupid amounts of money. I got no control over that folks. I'm really sorry to hear about it. There's certain venues where you can kind of make different deals, but a lot of venues including great ones like Massey Hall, they, they have, um, they have it set up online and people can just buy the tickets and then they can just sell them and there's nothing anybody can do about it. I don't know how he could stop people from buying the tickets and then trying to resell them at a higher, uh, face of scalping. Yeah, scalp. It's essentially like a leader in herself. Scalping. I mean, I don't know how they do it, but they charged stupid amounts of money for the tickets. I have nothing to do with that though, folks.

Speaker 6:          01:32:59       I'm sorry Louis C K is doing something different. Hash only you have to run to the comedy club and, and pay for cash. That's how he did it. He just said that's at the comedy store. But I think other places he's allowing people to buy tickets with credit cards. But you, you will, he can only use certain venues that don't have deals and he's trying to like figure out how to do it where it's going. Pearl Jam. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I guess I'm somewhere on that. But you can't do anything he wants, you know. Yeah. I mean he sold out the comedy store, which has 400 seats in like 20 minutes. And did he do it off of Twitter? Like how did people know that he was doing it? He just said, hey, I'm going to be at the comedy store. Yeah, he's not in town. They're very often, so when he's in, you know, in town, it's a big deal.

Speaker 6:          01:33:40       It's so good to see that La Salle has a great comedy scene like that. You know, that people are enjoying comedy enough that there's a big enough group of people that they can just immediately hear about that. And everybody like runs out cause those are probably like comedy fans, you know, seals come right out here. There's like, like when I moved out here, it was like 99, I think there was like three comedy clubs. Now. There's like five or six comedy clubs. Yeah. There's all these new ones too that have popped up. And there's so many like peripheral clubs, like the Irvine Improv, the Bray. I did Breyer last night with Collin. I'll let you go down. There was headlining. It popped in fucking hilarious man. He was great. It was really funny. And that's a great improv too. And then of course, the ice house. Oh, we have a show this, um, this Wednesday night at the ice house.

Speaker 6:          01:34:24       And, uh, it's a fucking stacked lineup. Ladies and gentleman, this is one of our best ones. Uh, were doing these as often as possible. We're trying to do these fucking things, uh, if not every week real close to him. And for us it's like an opportunity to fuck around to work on new material. And so you get a lot of guys who are stretching out and just fucking around and, and, and we also do a podcast simultaneously that you could download. It's only available off of the desk squad network, which is on iTunes. Are you guys selling tickets off that? No, no, no. We're selling tickets here at the ice house. The Ice House

Speaker 7:          01:34:58       takes it, but it's Dom Irrera, uh, Doug Benson, Joey Diaz, Duncan Trussell. Um, and Oh, Greg Fitzsimmons I as a good line and maybe Thompson girl, he might come down. He told me it's a phenomenal line and we're trying to do these as often as we can. And uh, it's 15 bucks and the fucking show sick. And you know, it goes on forever. I think death squad shows are great, but like it's hard for me to do new material there cause it always crushes cause you know they listened to the podcast and then like I have to take it somewhere else and try and crowd that doesn't listen to a podcast or doesn't know anything about that squad because there's such phenomenal crowds. They're like always so hot. And then I do a joke and I'm like, oh that crushed. And then I go somewhere where maybe they don't know my podcast and then just like, okay it did not get the refill.

Speaker 7:          01:35:44       It's also, they don't know you're his personality. So he's saying all this twisted shit. Yeah. What's the little fuck is this crazy Armenian asshole, but you're up there just slinging that comedy deck. Like they're your fans. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I go in there, I don't give a shit. And like I had to fall Ian Edwards last the couple a couple of days ago. Man, that kid is funny. Very funny dude. That guy's one of the best writers I know. And he always has huge clumps of new material and he makes me feel so lazy. Well you aren't lazy. I'm not lazy. Dooley's I worked my ass off Bro. Cause he lazy. I write a lot. I think he's really busy and a lot of different projects. I don't know. Let me say, do you feel lazy? Do you feel lazy when you watch a guy like Ian?

Speaker 7:          01:36:26       I sometimes I'll tell you why. Let me say when your gig not doing new new shit, whisper in there. There's a little feeling dizzy doodle feeling that you may be lazy. Listen, I, there was a time when I was doing a little too much partying and I didn't write like I used to. A reality comes out. I omit that. I always admit that. Now I know why people come my podcasts and stare at themselves. Hold back. It's very hard not to look at yourself on that squeak. Can you take me off and you can easily not looked at it. You're a grown man, Sam. I'll look me in the eye. I'm a very vain man. You liking the way you look? No, not at all. Being on this podcast right here on my rare quit drinking. Really? Yeah, so I'm self all Chubby and fat faced and then a, apparently Daniel tosh said it was bothering him and, and Tom's like, you know what?

Speaker 7:          01:37:12       That's it. Yeah. Well, I'm a, I'm in that same boat. I was doing a lot of party. I wish I could just do a little partying. I just, I want to party like it's, I don't remember flying Zeplin 1972 I'm going, we just got a new album out and it's a world tour. Yeah. That's not good for your liver. Yeah. Well that's why I wish I had them. I could just do it a little, but for me it's like going to the gym and just doing like one pushup and then you're like, oh, that's all I want to do. That's not how I do it. And you can enjoy a little bit of the marijuana. Just didn't the can once in a while, but it's not really like he has the air. I get really like paranoid. Yeah. You know why you should. Life is terrifying. Should be paranoid.

Speaker 6:          01:37:56       You're a little flesh bag, little flesh bag walking around. I was going to here. That's what we are. We're human flesh bags that we're all coming with vulnerable that cats dude. You know why? Because it's the only place you could talk some political shit. What brains not freezing up on you. I did one last night and you bring up the top and even it's a, it's a political podcasts and their brains just freeze and nobody wants to talk about Sam triple youtube. Most of your podcast with porn stars. Now that's not true. You do most of your mum without porn stars. I do. I do a wide range of it. That's one fourth. Yeah, there's still, the naughty show is only one fourth porn stars now to a whole bunch of, okay, so I'm, I'm out of the loop. So did you start off at one point in time was all like you would draw to get porn stars on and then you, you just backed off of it and just fixed it up.

Speaker 6:          01:38:43       It's like I'm bored with that. I want to be interviewed. Different things. I want to explore different parts of the world. But you find that when you get in dudes on, you talk politics with them and they freeze it up well, and not just necessarily on a podcast, but just in general in like normal conversations. This podcast I did last night where it's like brain just freeze up if you bring up, if you challenge someone's idea, they get like, uh, you know. But do you think that's what it is? I think also people are tired of hearing about politics. It's gross. Like they want to talk about sports, they want to talk about fun shit. They want to talk about movies or video games or anything. That's fun. It's like, you know when they're off of work and you start bringing up politics like, Oh fucking Christ with this.

Speaker 6:          01:39:23       You know? And for a lot of folks, I mean that's really how they look at Shit. It's, it's, it's hard to want to concentrate on some bullshit hustle that you have no real control over. Yeah. And I also think they're just tired of the same rhetoric and like they think it's going to just devolve into screaming. You got to put America back to work. Why they signed like free trade deals. That's what I left. Like that's why I like to talk about the stories that you only here for a glimpse and then they disappear. You're like, well what about that? And people that are, that's why. What do you think of Gay Republicans? There's a lot of them. Um, it's sorta like vampire familiars, you know, they want to stay close to the master, but it's also like, it's very interesting that they decided to go with their financial needs more than their social needs because I feel like most people vote on their social needs.

Speaker 6:          01:40:12       Very complicated. Sam. It was a lot of shit going on with being a gay repo again, first of all, the, the, the, the self loathing aspect of, you know, a lot of gay people are very ashamed of being gay. It's very sad and tragic, but it's also true. You know, I, I know gay people that are, that like are really uncomfortable about the way people view people that are gay. And so there's some self-loathing going on. There's also people that came from, you know, perhaps they came from like really restrictive a family environment. So they have like a deep sense of shame and, and their own sexual needs. And, you know, they, uh, they, they don't mind that this, a Republican party loads their existence and, and wants to stop them from being married. They don't mind as long as they appear to be, you know, they appear to be respectable and they're connected with the Republicans.

Speaker 6:          01:41:02       It's like they're having dinner with the vampire. Right. You know, they're, they're like right there with the, the monster that, that holds them back and treats them like shit and wants to throw rocks at them. They caught them fucking, you know, so there's something to that. Yeah. Well, there's something that people become, well, there's a lot of, uh, you know, uh, black eyes become, uh, really, uh, they become like uncle Tom Ish with, with, with, with racists. And they, they, they embrace the, the one that's holding the Mac. You know, it's a, a common thing that's d that drove people crazy in the black community when they would find a, a black eye, you know, cow town to racists like that just set a, you know, that that gross sort of a thing whole came massa whatever you need mass. Right. And I'm like man, this is sad shit.

Speaker 6:          01:41:45       Like what are you doing man? You're, you're, you're like, you get need to get away with this piece of shit. This guy's a slave owner. One of my favorite bits of years when I first started watching him perform was about how interracial porn is. Like the number one porn and it disproportionate amount of people watch internet, interracial porn in the deep south disproportionate amount. And I was like, well that's not not black guys watching that shit. Yeah. It's white guys. Yeah. Yeah. Cause they just so nasty. There's just something about that. It seems so taboo. Boobs. She bond that black did limit her enjoying it.

Speaker 6:          01:42:24       Yeah. It's a, there's something fucked up about race hasn't man, there's something really weird about it from a state of fear. It's just fear of, uh, and there's some, uh, you know, ethnocentrism is also weird shit. We were, you know, it's not even about black people. Like, well, how about about like Chinese workers that, you know, make your cell phone to get 50 cents a week? I'm exaggerating. I don't know what they really get, but it's, you know, the Foxconn suicides and you find out these factories where all your iPhone shit is getting creative is got nets set up because people want to jump off the roof. Like, Oh yeah, yeah, pretty fucking crazy. And I've heard people defending that when they go, well, actually if you think about it, the number of people that commit suicide there, it's a actually less than your average city.

Speaker 6:          01:43:10       And Foxconn is basically like a city. There's 500,000 people live in there. And you're like, yeah, but most people don't commit suicide at work. And the, the, their whole argument was, well, if they made an iPhone here in America, it will cost $5,000. You're like, okay, so that's kind of a like a very selfish point of view, right? Yeah. Well it is true. It is true that it would cost more money, but I think it's been disproven that it would cost that much more money. I think they said it would cost like an extra 50 bucks or something like that. And you can make a, an iPhone in, in America and pay people a fair wage. I forgot the number, so I shouldn't really say 50 bucks, but it wasn't enough to really shock the shit out of me. But then I've seen other ones that say it's thousands of dollars, like 14,000 so

Speaker 7:          01:43:52       I don't know who the fuck is. Right. And who's telling the truth and what kind of funny Hollywood logic they're doing as far as their, their math and a lot racism. Go to China. That's racism, man. I went there with Steve Burns. I had a beard on, I looked very middle eastern when I get a beard rocking and I could not get a taxi to pick me up because middle easterns over there, they think they're all drug dealers. So no one would pick us up. So we, we flagged down this one guy that would pick us up and he literally had taken what looks like a hot dog vending machine and turned it into a taxi and we sat in the back and you can ask anybody who goes to like China driving over there is crazy. They have lights but they don't follow him. They're like Christmas ornaments, traffic lights.

Speaker 7:          01:44:39       They're just over there blinking and no one's following them. Really go through red lights. I do. Here's a crazy thing, right? You want to make a lefthand turn in China. You don't make it from the left hand side. You come all the way from the right and you turn over there. Why don't, I don't know why. It's two weirdest thing I've ever seen. No one does it that way. Yeah, but because that's how they do it over there. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. They don't ever turn left from the left lane. No math from the right and we were over here. You turn way over there. Can we find evidence of this online? Google the I. Everything I say here, I know will be instantly googled. Uh, but yeah, man, it's crazy. Me and Steve Byrne, we screamed like little girls at least 13 times on the ride home. It is scary. Here's the thing, didn't see one

Speaker 6:          01:45:26       traffic accident, not one over there. And the bulk of the country drives on the right. Oh, okay. I think there's some confusion here.

Speaker 7:          01:45:35       Well, I don't know what the confusion is. I did it.

Speaker 6:          01:45:37       I think, um, some of the country in China drives on the right, but some drives on the left. So maybe that's where the, the, the, the issue is. Does that make sense?

Speaker 7:          01:45:47       See, after people drive on the right side and half people, why I'm telling you man, they travel. They don't slow down, dude. They just go right in to the, they just go

Speaker 6:          01:45:56       right in. What are we watching accidents? This is Chinese trafficked. I don't want to see Chinese traffic cause you know someone's going to get run over. There was some horrible shit that I saw online of a, Oh shit. Oh fuck dude on a motorcycle. They nailed it.

Speaker 7:          01:46:15       Let's see. That's what they do. They just drive through. They don't give a shit. There's no rules. No. Look at this. This is nuts. Oh my God, this is nuts. You know what? I hate seeing stereotypes played out right before my fucking eyes, but where are the Chinese Nascar drivers? Oh my God. He just nailed an old lady on her bike. Oh my God. These people are fucking crazy telling you, man, you scream like a little girl, like dried mixed. Look at this video. This is crazy. These people are in the with the shitty cars and they just drive and through intersections. I hate saying this because I know on it would, I don't want to believe in stereotypes. Oh Jesus. Oh, hit by a bike and the other guy runs over him and then keeps going. They don't care, dude. There's a billion of them.

Speaker 7:          01:47:08       Oh my God. Look at this guy trying to make it across. This is insane. This guy cannot do this. He must back up and rethink and get a helicopter. That's the only way he's getting across that lane. People are fucking nuts, man. They don't care. I don't like watching this. This has given me mad anxiety. Can you imagine? Oh Jesus Christ. He's kind of motorcycle. Oh he had dodged one and then got nailed by another. Oh my God. They man, the fact that those guys are stopped is amazing. It just like they, we vote Jesus. Look at this. Oh Jesus, look at this. Boom. Oh my God. These people on bikes are insane. They're trying to cross the traffic. They just say ready. Go. Their streets must just be like egg drop soup everywhere. Just brain. What they saying. A lot of it has to do with the Chinese culture and the way they interact with people.

Speaker 7:          01:48:00       They mind their own business. They don't look to the left into the right. They just keep, keep straight. And because of that, this leak there socially, this is explained to me by a Chinese man that the, the, the, the way they're socially, um, sort of a groom to interact with people and walking. Cause there's so many people you bump into people all the time that they've sort of taking this and then drive. They drive with the same mentality. They go through red lights. Yeah, exact opposite of what you're supposed to do when you're driving. You're supposed to look to the left, look to light, check your rear view. Look who's beside you. Check. This is fucking crazy ass hole. He might drive nutty. Let me back off. Let him ahead. Amazed about you while we were in Sacramento. How much you follow the rules of the road?

Speaker 7:          01:48:41       Really? Yeah. Like yeah. Well what did you think I would do? We'll look at bigs. No, when my fake my own cop light on the roof. Not that at all. But when like drinking bottles, when drug and red band with our gps to the, where we went to go eat afterwards. Uh, you did a u turn, you're like a make a uturn here and you're like, ah, I can't do that right here. I have to pull in over here. Like I would have been like just you turn right there, there's a little sign that says no. You turn and when you see one of those, don't take a fucking new term. It's not that hard. Well there's nobody coming. I would you turn it in common, but that could be someone watching Sam cops. You don't want to give them an excuse to pull you over. It Says No. You turn. How hard is it to take a left pull into a driveway and turn in an Rv Park? Pretty fucking easy. Yeah. We went to an ivy mark when, uh, if they ever do you have season China, you should do a show because there's tons of ex pats cause it's like the wild west over there. It's like you don't have everybody in China, in China. There's a lot of ex pats. I had the best time out there, man. You did a lot of stand up. Steve Byrne took me out.

Speaker 6:          01:49:48       We did a co we gigs all over the place. Man. Shanghai is the shit man. I really, Shanghai is the shit dude. Who knows how people, I don't know. Steve Byrne took care of it and he'd say, Hey, you want to come out? I'm like, yeah man, I'll do it. And it was a great time, man. I saw an Anthony Bordain special in Shanghai. It looked like he was having a good fucking time. Dude. They leave. They leave. If you're like an American, they'd leave you alone, man. I think it was Shane. I had to leave you alone, dude. Oh yeah. He'd drink all night and it's like old, the old west where men are men. Dude. It's like a gray, like, whoa. This is what it was like. Well, you're telling me is you can go to a massage power and get jerked off. Anything you want over there as a, as a, as an American man.

Speaker 6:          01:50:28       Really. I had the best time. How's the food? Food's phenomenal, man. Dude dies. They'll eat it. Whoa. That's how China, you go to a menu, they're like squirrel. They got everything and they're throwing anything on a grill. Did you fuck around at all and experiment with different kinds of, you need a dog or anything? No, I, you know what man, I can't eat a dog and I don't want to eat. Like they put, they do that thing from Indiana Jones where they put a monkey in the middle of the fucking table and he started whacking on fat and I'm like, that never happened to me. But I'm like, dude, I can't watch this. I don't want to eat this thing. And they'll watch it getting pound on the, hey, what did they hit with a hammer? They hit the monkey's head like they didn't do it for me, but I, someone told me they were over there in China and they were, they, they like put them in the middle thing, locked him up.

Speaker 6:          01:51:10       Heads. You stay and they go rains, right? Yeah, I can't do it. What the fuck is that man? How is that a real way to eat? I just think it's just cruel. Delicious. But you think it is because you would want to whack on a poor monkey's head. You know that like how smart they are. Well you know what it is. I think, I think if you're trying to like appease only the elite, you know, and give them some crazy thing that only they have access to is a, there's a certain satisfaction that some sick fucks get into being cruel and to having something that's so delicate. It's such a delicacy. So rare we have brought in a special McCall monkey, you know, poor little fuck. It's locked up in a little guillotine choke. You mean Agar old? The goal, as soon as they put the monkey and the thing I'm out, they sat in real.

Speaker 6:          01:51:51       Cause I heard that the scene in faces of death was faked that scene. Well that's probably, that part is fake, but they really do do that. Do they really? Yeah. Okay. Let's look that up. That seems like something I showed them. No Rogan's fact checks. But yeah. So it say among his sound effect check bonky hit with so far Sam's record hammer. So monkey and hit with a hammer, uh, in front of guests. Maybe diners, front of diners, Youtube. That shit, man. Youtube that sheet. Let's see. Faces of death. The monkey diner scene is also unconvincing. Yeah. Okay. But it, but it does, it actually happen. This is, it's a lot of, this is all about the, uh, can you Google that? Does monkey eating monkey brains? Yeah. Maybe another search. Let me try another shirt. Shop eating monkey brains. I couldn't do that, dude.

Speaker 6:          01:52:45       That's another reason I just, I want China. Okay. Yeah, yeah, yeah. That's uh, eating monkey brains and China's actually monkey baby is controversial food stuff often attributed to the Chinese. Okay. Wow. This is crazy, dude. If you go to Google, they have images of like pleats of monkey brains. Dude, I don't want to see that here too. It's also found it's not, it's a controversial food stuff often attributed to the Chinese, but also found is certain other countries, the practice of eating monkey brains has led to over hunting in Indonesia. Especially due to the unfounded belief that eating monkey brains can cure impotence. It turns is about curing impotence with these fucks. They're always eating no China, they're always even like tiger claw and all this nutty shit that doesn't do anything to try to cure and don't they know about Viagara. Why do you have to have monkey brains when you have viagara silly box that's discussing the brain is when the, when the Beijing Olympics happened, they put out the government without, you can't serve dog.

Speaker 6:          01:53:44       Cause they knew like Westerners would freak out and they were told they have to serve black people. Cause the Chinese, they're not in the black people, but yet they love Kobe Bryant and Lebron James and all that shit. But they had to put that out to the Chinese. Don't care man. It's okay. Here's a problem. Uh, the eating of monkey brains from living monkeys is a part of some restaurants menu is this one? Well, no example of urban legend. It's not true. Yeah. They don't actually eat monkeys like that in restaurants. I mean, maybe someone's tried it, but it's not a every restaurant. I still get a point for that. That's real shit. Well, monkey brains eating monkey brains is real shit. Thank. Apparently they just, they'd cook them too. It's like also it was a scene in Indiana. Jones been a scene of a bunch of movies. But, uh, I don't say according to this article at least it seems to think that it's an urban legend. Maybe I should check Snopes. Snopes as good at that shit. How about we just agree I'm right and we just, well, you definitely are right about the meat and monkey brains. I want to know whether or not they actually hold the fucking monkey in that little box and beat his head and then scoop it out. Speaking of, okay, here's a question. Speaking of Monkey.

Speaker 2:          01:55:01       Yeah. I, I found out that Bobby leads in a new TV show or now I NBC where he plays with the monkey from the hangover and I guess that that the monkey is going to be a huge, it's going to be a new monkey show. And like every week it's happening in the bear. Yeah. Oh, so based, supposedly really funny. It's lobbying and a monkey like tested like the highest they've ever tested on NBC. Any, yeah. Any TV show ever on NBC lobbyists. A monkey. Gabby, Leanna, monkey. Can't wait. Yeah. What, what, what happens with that? This rehearsed that scene. It's like a monkey.

Speaker 6:          01:55:34       Yeah. That's a, how do you get the monkey to do what you want them to do? Yeah. It's either going to be the greatest thing ever or the worst thing ever, but I have feeling it's feelings to be phenomenal.

Speaker 2:          01:55:44       I think anything Bobby Lee's going to be as funny. Yeah, that mustache is lethal. He's hilarious. So it's Todd glass man on the burn. If he'd get to check out Todd glass on the burn, he just fucking came in there and just destroyed. Well, he's a guy who's just fast and always had a great opinion. Anytime you watch them on stage, he's the guy that's very much in the moment. He's not just, it's not just complete scripted. He, he's not afraid to lay in, lay the wood to the crowd. Would you ever get high and go scouting what? Scouting? Like Eagle Scout and you were talking about the boy scouts earlier and I was thinking how cool it would it be just like once a month you and your friends get high and go scouting in the woods just to make fun of the other scouts. So it'd be like pretty funny. No, because we're too old for that and they add our age. You put in the scouts were probably pedophiles. Okay,

Speaker 1:          01:56:32       here's the deal. Um, this is the deal. A lot of people do eat monkey brains, Ra and they shoot them. They have a special way of shooting the monkey out of the tree. Oh yeah. We shoot them to get them to jump first. You shoot Adam and he jumps and then you have to shoot him because you can't just shoot them when they're up in the tree because they'll, you know, they'll lock onto a branch and then they'll rot up there. You can never get them down. It's really crazy. The, apparently they shoot him all the time and uh, but the monkey brains are eating raw and they do eat them like generally right after they killed him. So that, that is, that is a real, a way they eat the monkey brands. That's fucked up.

Speaker 2:          01:57:12       Yeah. I don't want that man. That's like going to a hamburger restaurant and hey, here's your sledge hammer and you got to go like, just drop the wood on some a cow, man. I like, I don't dig that at all.

Speaker 1:          01:57:24       Yeah. Whoa. Okay. Well, here's the, here's another thing though. A guy is, uh, giving a depiction in another article, uh, of a monkey's head being supported in a bracket, two pieces of wood with a semicircular hole on each side so that when you put them together, they form a complete circle around the animal's neck, allowing the head to be exposed above the plank. The hair around the head is shaved with a razor blade and a small chisel and a hammer is used to quickly chisel a circle around the crown and the top part of the skull is removed. A teaspoon is used to scoop up the brains, which is immediately, this has to be done before the monkey dies. Oh God. Why you just unnecessary there people? Wow. So this is a, not only will you a corrected that has happened that this is, um, this has been going on for a long time. This was written in 1948 or 1949. He's an eye witness. And he didn't say whether or not he'd partaken in. The brain's themselves. Look behind. You know, don't, don't, dude, I want to see that. Is that legit? Dude? I want to see that. Whoa. This is fucking crazy. Keeping on, keeping on. Keeping on.

Speaker 2:          01:58:31       Uh, this is just a documentary talking about the faces of death documentary.

Speaker 1:          01:58:36       So is it real? They're saying that this is a real middle of the, the table. We're prepared

Speaker 2:          01:58:42       for the kill. You don't have to watch it. We don't have to watch it. You can watch it if you want. Yeah. We don't know. Some people that want to see that shit.

Speaker 6:          01:58:56       Um, you know what? What is that? Is that just a Desperado? They just need food so bad. It just seems like when you go that deep or you're, you're being cruel to a monkey like that. You're not, you. You want to scoop out. His brains were still alive. Yeah. And you know how smart they are. I just, I don't know. Ever since I got a dog, I'm really sensitive. What about animal? What about monkeys that are assholes? Yeah, there's a lot of them. Monkeys are assholes. They killed the mayor in India. Monkeys assaulted and killed a mayor. The mayor was just hanging out and the monkeys just walked up and just mean mugged him. He's fucking with the monkeys. Why would he do that? I think monkeys steal things from you. They steal food from you and shiny things and you have to give them food to get the shiny things back sometimes and they steal things that they think that you will find valuable.

Speaker 6:          01:59:44       Like they'll steal your cell phone. You have to give them food to get it back. And if you just try to take the cell phone, they'll fucking attack you. That sounds like it's survival. I mean like there's a bit of survival. They, I just, I don't know man. When I see people fucking with animals, I just, I root for the animal. I don't know why they don't have any commerce. They don't have any concept of personal like property. Like they don't get that. They don't own things. So when you have something shiny, they're a little brain knows that if they just Jack your shiny shit, then you have to give them food and wanted to get that shiny shit back. That's how their culture works. So you bribed monkeys? Yes. You can bribe him. Yeah, you can get your shit back.

Speaker 2:          02:00:21       There's actually like a small town or village that there's are a monkey that would tried to rape a bunch of women and that were, here's the article on the Telegraph. I'll just live monkeys. Just looks like a rapist. Monkey tried to take it. Look at his face. He looks all rapists. That definitely is a rapey monk. That's a Reiki looking a little monkey.

Speaker 6:          02:00:41       Okay. This mean face. This looks like he doesn't give a fuck about anything. Take your manhood. Oh, he'll fuck you would not want to go to jail and share a cell with that monkey. You imagine. How long could you think you could fight off a monkey? I was at the zoo the other day and the dude who a, the got an a little train tour, you know, and the dude who's gay gave us the train tour, said that these little monkeys that they had were only 25 pounds, but they had twice the strength of a grown man. Is that real fuck does a monkey that's 25 pounds have twice. Imagine a retarded monkey.

Speaker 2:          02:01:17       Superman strength. Take 75 is so rude. Do they have down syndrome monkeys? I was saying about that. You never see that in any other animal, do you? No. No you don't. Yeah, we'll sign. He's looked like Johnny has like the Johnny Carson eyes where the closer together. So I think so. I think some of those monkeys might be, no, I don't think so. I don't think they live. I don't think, uh,

Speaker 7:          02:01:40       I don't know. I'm, I'm guessing, but I don't think that they, I don't think they live. Monk monkeys are like Asians. They put a stop to that shit quick. This guy's saying that I've seen a 25 pound monkey overpower 50 pound man. A 50 pound man. Was We all, sorry, 150 pound male. Sorry. Yeah. Um, this was a guy who is a, um, an anthropologist, but that guy could have been a pussy. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And you ever see that one video where like, they showed that women could beat up guys and they had like a girl box, but it was like the most feminine Asian Man could possibly flows. They did. They had a boxing match between when a woman and a man, the battle of the sexes and the guy they got was the most feminine, Real Asian Man I've ever seen. He's guys asked straight up whooped.

Speaker 7:          02:02:26       Okay, so they set it up. They get chicken. Well, yeah, you put Ronda Rousey and what some dude, it doesn't have to have know how to fight. She will fuck you up. I would quit. I do like that. I love her. Just getting mouthy. So high angled by is really hot. It's hot as fuck. She's cool as fuck too. She can hang man. She can hang with anybody and she trains hard. I was talking to some dudes today, they've got arm barred her by her it cold cars place. The only reason I couldn't date a girl like that skilled in MMA is because I've literally been swung on by every girl I've ever dated. So I mean the girl, you've pretty much, at some point they swung on me and I never hit a girl in my life. Oh well that's not what we're saying. But why would all these people, sometimes they get emotional with me.

Speaker 7:          02:03:11       Why? What do you Sam, what are you doing to these girls? Sometimes. Sometimes I got to play a bad guy and I got to cut off the Dick for a little while is sometimes you cut off the Dick. That's what makes him swing. What kind of magic, Dick, are you swinging? Fucking Mandy Dick, kind of delicious candy. Did Sam Shipley. I got Cuckoo Dick. I got to make the girls go. I got stocker Dick. I'm not hung, but for some reason they go stocker crazy. Really? Yeah. Wow. That's interesting. You just know how to fuck. Is that what it is? I take a lot of pride in that. Take a lot of pride in your work. Well, you know what? I've seen what you do on stage and if you could rock it like that in the bedroom, I would imagine would be pretty blown away by your performance.

Speaker 7:          02:03:50       I got to find a girl with a small set of vagina and then we're good to go. You know, small. I'm not hung it all. Okay. You just need a small vagina that you could really tear up. I could get a big one and just, you know, I got to work a little harder. But how do you gauge whether or not a girl is a small vagina? No. Oh, I put it in and if I'm banging the sides, it's a little bigger than if, and then there, there used to be this chicken, uh, Canada. Way Back in the day I used to bang. I mean, I've never felt something that type before in my life. I mean, I was, I'm not, and I'm not hungry. I'm like, Oh my God, I'm fighting to get it in. It was, was she muscular? No. Is it her asshole? No. Was it her taint? You just broke a hole through her team. You didn't even fuck are you just stabbed her? Yeah. I dated a girl who was not a small girl. She was a big

Speaker 6:          02:04:38       girl, man. I mean, she was like, uh, like stout that she was a like, I think she's mostly Ukrainian. She's really strong. Like a strong, her policy was like, oh, vice. Yep, like a vice. I was like, wow, like I've dated girls that were like way smaller than her physically with like bigger vaginas. I have a theory that's where it's not completely sound right

Speaker 7:          02:05:01       but like the taller, bigger girls had the tighter vaginas. A smaller smaller girls have the, I don't think so cause I was met. I'll tall girls have giant pussies to what's weird is my first and my first girlfriend ever. I could fist and I was talking to this today like I remember like kind of squeeze my hand and I get it in there and then it was just like go town and I would wait a minute, that's a meme right there. I would squeeze my fingers know and get my whole hand in there and then it was just like go town.

Speaker 7:          02:05:34       But but you'd have little hands. No I'm, that's what I'm saying. Did I just have small hands as a child now and now I'm trying to think what if I have really small hands and everyone made fun of me. I didn't know about it. How old were you? 1515 a buddy of mine and I hate telling his story, but it's so good for a year. He's, he always tells me about all these crazy craigslist shit he does and back page and he goes, he goes, yeah. He goes, I want to hook up with this chick. And she goes, she made me fist her while she watched

Speaker 6:          02:06:06       gay porn. Whoa. And like all fist, her ass, her pussy, her pussy. And I go,

Speaker 7:          02:06:12       Huh. And then did you have to pay her because you're doing all the work,

Speaker 6:          02:06:16       work on that and what did he get out of it? I don't know. He gets off. I'm begging hookers. It's this thing. She's a hooker. I mean like it's a, it's a bat like backpage is really hooker. Ish. Okay. So he's getting this girl in this really hooker ish manner and then he's, and it's his story. I want to give him credit. I just don't know. Honestly, I don't know if he wants his name. Don't say his name just in case he's a, so he's fisting them and paying them.

Speaker 7:          02:06:43       I'm like, why are you paying them? They should pay you. I've heard a dude's to, I've heard of it, kind of

Speaker 6:          02:06:47       a gay dudes who pay guys to suck their dicks, pay like straight guys and suck their dicks like that. Apparently it's pretty common. I don't know. Can you be, it's better than giving plasma. I bet you know that. You know, like when he kicked drawing for money, by the way, we're going to get that Peter Duesberg guy on the podcast and people have told me that it's an irresponsible thing to do, uh, that he's, uh, the professor is a unit from the University of California Berkeley and is a biology professor, is rock solid credentials this guy has. And he apparently claims that HIV is a virus and it is not what is responsible for aids. He claims that AIDS is, uh, what it is is when people have a crushed immune system, most likely in the gay community,

Speaker 1:          02:07:36       it has to do with partying and has to do it. Taking email nitrate and a bunch of different, like really heavy drugs that are 10 crystal meth that are devastating to your immune system. Hold on. And he says that when these people show these, uh, the, their, their immune system is crushed and then they show that they have HIV in their system. The reason is that their immune system is too weak to fight off the HIV. It's not that HIV has brought them to that point. He said it's a variety of different ailments that a lot of it is caused by, um, by hardcore partying. Then what's the blood transfusion and careless? Well, he's, well, first of all, he's a, um, he's a very prominent scientist. I mean, he's very well respected guy. Again, he's from the, he has tenure at the University of California, Berkeley.

Speaker 1:          02:08:20       I mean, he's a, is Berkeley with a B or is it like, what do you mean? Like I can say correctly, spelled, spelled silent. K Two. They're getting, that's funny. Yeah. Yeah. Well, he's a super, super controversial guy. Why did they say it's reckless though? Because people say he's full of Shit and that, uh, AIDS does. Um, you know, I've talked about this with Fitzsimmons and we had this discussion and one of the things that I said was that it's really terrifying when you to fucking dumb to know who's stupid, you know, like is he stupid or are the other people that are climbing the HIV does cause aids? There's no way they stupid. Maybe he's interpretation of it. It's different. I mean, it's really crazy. Um, I, I don't, I don't know who's right, but I'm going to bring him on and then of course there'll be some people that disagree with him, so I'm going to want to hear from them too and just Holler at me on Twitter and we'll figure out what, how, how to address this.

Speaker 1:          02:09:11       I all I can do when it comes to this sort of a, um, this sort of incredibly controversial subject that I really am not qualified medically to under. I mean, I don't understand the idea behind a retro viruses and [inaudible] and HIV. I don't understand it. I don't understand the argument either way. So we'll, we'll be forced to try to spell this out. Mr Duisburg argument as as cleanly as possible. But of course there's a lot of really controversial aspects to it. One of the big ones being how the fuck is it possible that something can get to be this sort of mainstream accepted belief that HIV causes AIDS when he says it's Bs and what is his argument? And then of course we'll get someone else on afterwards that's a counselor, whatever's initially told to them and then they just run with it. That's what politicians had been doing forever.

Speaker 1:          02:10:02       They just put something out and then they just, that's, it's all misinformation. I don't know about that. I don't, I mean I know there's a lot of scientists who work on AIDS cures and HIV cures, so I need to of course speak to someone like that as well as Mr Duesberg. And then ultimately the fucking most awesome thing would be to have the two of them together and give them a forum after, uh, you know, Duisburg podcast and then dues someone who refutes his information. Then have the two of them would get together and then we can, Tom Tom Wrestle,

Speaker 6:          02:10:34       play poker. I don't know. I think that will be pretty fucking interesting. I would like to know, I mean, if Duesberg is right, that's a crazy thing. I mean, if you think about all the nutty things that we've already discovered about how fucking goofy our culture is, if we found out that that's the case too. But again, I'm not giving out any health advice folks. Okay. Especially when it comes to diseases. I'm a fucking standup comedian slash cage fighting commentator. I'm the last person you should be listening to when it comes to information about aids. So all the people that are worried about like distributing this, like this guy is a murderer. What? He's his, this information that let the guy talk. He's, if he's way of fucking smarter and more educated on this subject, and most of the people that are questioning him. So it's a, I wa I re-read odd, behold the pale horse, uh, that one book that he was talking about aids and how like it's, it's government made and that guy's, that Guy William Cooper is his name. Yeah. Him and your boy. Who's the other conspiracy theories? Jones. Yeah. They supposedly had a big like, yeah. Well, you know, conspiracy theorists all hate the other conspiracy theorists like Latino comics, they're like Latino.

Speaker 6:          02:11:51       Somebody just put out a picture of a monkey and a fuck you looking at Tripoli. I know. Hey, hey, hey, oh yeah. A lot of those conspiracy guys, they come from complained that the other gods are idiots and that they're all spewing out this information. And they always claimed that the other guy's a government agent. You know, they all think that everybody, everybody's a government agent. It's really interesting. But that Guy William Cooper said a lot of the shit I remember reading, behold a pale horse. Is that what it's called? Yeah. And I remember reading it going, this guy is either crazy or he's doing this is like some disinformation bit. Well, yeah, that was the whole theory on that too. But big on aliens that they're already here, but are part of everything here. That, and I go, come on, man, you gotta give me some evidence.

Speaker 6:          02:12:33       You can't just say the aliens are here. You know, you just, there was too much. There's bases on the moon. Aliens are and they'd show you traveled to far galaxies and all that stuff. If you've seen those arguments, the images about basis. Yay. Let's see, this was the glass tower. Like what are you seeing that, I'm not saying it's fine. Once you find what you're looking for, there's, if you Google structures on the moon, you will lose all faith in human race, look googled structures in the moon. And these images that people are trying to say are like, like buildings and shit and you're like, what the hell? They're talking about. All righty. Uh, a huge moon base. And that one point, the Russians and the Americans work together on it and that the Russians tried to take all the Americans hostages and they had to send in some like navy seal motherfuckers and it killed off 66 people.

Speaker 6:          02:13:28       Yeah. There's people that think that the moon is actually an alien base and then it's a spaceship and a, they point to the fact that we dropped a satellite on the moon once and it rang for like a day. Like it, like it rang like it was hollow. It's like there's some nutty motherfuckers been contacted from people that believed that the earth is hollow. If you ever been contacted by those people. Now is that the lizards live? Um, I don't think so. I think they think that there's a whole sky in there. I'm not sure. I think there's more than one group of people when it comes to the hollow earth thing. But uh, that there, it was like the matrix that there's a whole civilization underground. Yeah. Yeah. There's a whole world going on in there inside the earth. You just got to go. There's a whole, you find you're always raving.

Speaker 6:          02:14:16       He'd go in there and just like stars and shit. I guess they just have like, like a little kid has those glow in the dark stickers. They have stars somehow. I Dunno. I Dunno what the fuck they're claiming, but it's, uh, it's pretty hilarious at this point in time. How many times we have to see volcanoes and go, oh, that's inside of it. Yeah. Where does that come from? Looking at a Krispy Kreme doughnut and thinking there's diamonds in there. Look, there's this cream in their stupid, see it coming out the top? Yeah. That's what's in the whole fucking it backed up chimneys. What's going on down there?

Speaker 2:          02:14:45       More proof that this whole road is not real. Joe, check this at the Guardian us data. A whistle blower. It's a violation of everyone's constitutional rights and it's the formal national security agency officer. It was saying how the u s is illegally collecting huge amounts of data on his fellow citizens. Right. And then the first sentence sitting in its surroundings of an olive garden,

Speaker 6:          02:15:06       all that. So it's an uh, an an olive garden too. Is he talking about the restaurant, the Nakia surroundings of an olive garden and the Baltimore suburbs. He's talking about the restaurant he ate at the restaurant. He ate it all. Garn yeah, that's the guy that we had when we had David Seaman on the podcast. Yeah, I remember that. Congressional candidate. Yeah. Vinnie is the NSA whistleblower. He's the mathematician I know needs it. Olive Garden, you know, you have create you how crazy you are with this shit. You fuck you know crazy. You are. I was watching an olive garden commercial at all I could think of is you, you silly bitch, you can get free breadsticks. I'm like fucking Brian. And I'm watching the elite more for them. Their commercials. Oh yeah, he's made olive garden. A cool thing to do, people were fans of the podcast.

Speaker 6:          02:15:50       Sometimes we'll go to olive garden. Just how to support. Where do you want to eat? Well, red band likes all garden. Let's go eat there. By the way, a, I'm wearing a death squad tee shirt, one of the, uh, the new super sexy ones with a, my favorite cat. And you can get these go to desk squad. Dot. TV and, and, and by him. And uh, whenever you do something like that, it supports a Brian's podcast. Now I might put the black cock bomb on the, on the, which Sam Tripoli is a part of which I was going to say the naughty show, which is Sam's. It's we're doing tonight. You guys doing tonight? What are you, who's on it tonight? Gareth Reynolds, the funniest fucker. And a good friend of mine had a show, has a show coming out and MTV, he went to New York to shoot until he just got back.

Speaker 7:          02:16:29       Dave Anthony's. Gonna come on. We're going to talk about those. It, uh, it's, uh, what's it, how comes Greinke show? I know it's a, uh, it's called, isn't it called something like laugh or fail or it's called fail or something like that. It's like some weird kind of like, it's some Internet thing. I don't even know. He'll describe it.

Speaker 1:          02:16:48       Just fails. Would fuck ups. I mean, think about how many traffic accidents. It's, Doug Benson had a great idea that I need to really get on about me doing commentary over Internet fight.

Speaker 7:          02:16:59       Yeah. I always wanted to do that, dude. Just like, pick up the, fucking find these, these are hilarious videos of black chicks swinging on each other or some of the best videos you'll ever watch in your life.

Speaker 1:          02:17:10       Yeah. And me doing it, it would be, you know, that I would like to do that. I think that'd be a perfect thing for me because uh, you know, obviously the UFC commentary background and stand up and watching those things. There's some funny fucking Vinnie and there's so many. You never run out of them.

Speaker 6:          02:26:08       Blurry sites, dollars riding on this shit. Winner, winner, chicken dinner. Very excited about Toronto this weekend. Sam trip. I am too. We get in Thursday night and there's allegedly a place where you can allegedly smoke marijuana while you allegedly have a comedy show. At the same time. I need to find out what the laws are. I've allegedly done standup at that legend. No, no, no, no. Nonsense craziness. You've never been there. Arch fear might be joining us. It's all depending on whether or not he's contractually obligated to say he can't. Oh, that's right. Well it's just for laughs is also promoting my show up there as well. It's all taking place during the comedy festival, so we're doing Massey hall on Friday, which is super duper fucking awesome. Did you do a Massey Hall with me last time? So sick. Yeah, it was a great time to is phenomenal.

Speaker 6:          02:26:58       It's Doug Benson going to be there. I don't think he's in Canada that week, but he is going to be at the ice house Wednesday night. Dad's, Doug Benson, dom, I rera, Greg Fitzsimmons, Duncan Trussell, Brian Red Ban and me. Can I promote where he did his show? He is to promote the shit out of it. Sam trevally. September 26 the noughties show presents the 2012 searchlight model finale by fleshlight whites. A searchlight for now. A model. Well yeah. What do you like the American idol of sex toys. So you, a bunch of girls dance around and then they decide which one gets a flashlight on. You been having like voting's been going on for like a month. Do they have to see their pussy? Do they have to show that? Cause you, you should really know like what if it's a training, any wins. We need to set these big name girls there. Oh, I saw Alexis, Texas, Kayden Kross and this girl with the grace name a fixie out.

Speaker 6:          02:27:51       No War is her name. Alexis Texas is one of those girls who could never make it on a sitcom. Never make it like in the, the the like the movie version of what you know, super skinny girls so people think is high, but dude's look at that girl's ass and go crazy for that. Yeah. A lot of girls would be like, oh, she's too big or she's, they'll fuck outta here. That's not what dudes thing. They look at that big giant juicy ass and go, holy fuck. I wonder if she's insured. It let people like and what like the media is image of what is hot is like, is this a little off? I tell girls all the time to stop letting television and magazines tell you what's sexy guys don't like that. Guys like me on the bone. It's, yeah, there's something about a girl who's like really, really like lean and skinny and like six packy.

Speaker 6:          02:28:42       It says something a little weird about that. Where's the girls got like 10 pounds more honor than she needs. Z androgyny is what? I can't like these supermodels, they're not even hot anymore. Well you know that's all designed like the idea of supermodels or reason why they were like really tall and thin. It's so clothes look good on them. So close, sorta lay on them and you've got a chance to really see the clothes. Whereas like you put light but you come way back in the day. We put some clothes on a girl with big giant tits and a big ass and all you're seeing is that big giant tits and the big ass. Any Crawford was hot back in the day and she was the supermind. Now they're all just so in. They look like heroin addicts. I don't pay attention. Not Looking at model magazine.

Speaker 6:          02:29:22       Sam, what the fuck are you doing? This is some major pieces of his life when he, he's always, I can't say, I'm not trying to drag you up to the 21st century Russian chicks in dolphin fighting videos trying to make you a part of today. Sam, I to come apart today, bring you up to the now I'm writing a lot. Working hard are stopping. Listen man, it's important that we all give each other shit about that. No, I know. It's got to be inspired. You know we bought Xoom shitty new shit in a, a big show like yours while it's only shitty new shit, if you decide that you're writing shitty stuff. Brian opened up with a fucking, not opened up but he did a whole new bit in front of 1200 people in a sold out show and it killed my first time doing it.

Speaker 6:          02:30:07       First Time doing that. Right. You know why? Cause he's got boss. Don't even say that. My whole thing is false. I'll set the place on fire. You say that and we say that but yet you, you feel like your new stuff is just like never said that said I want to, don't want to, I mean allium dude, I write in volume. I'm always throwing stuff against the wall and sometimes I only find it funny. So if you write 10 new bits, I'm happy if three or four of them are, are good crushers, meet you. Let me too. So I don't want to try that other six in, in, in a sh show, like a theater show we're doing here at the ice house. I'll throw garbage and just see what works. So what you're saying is you just, when you get to like a theater show, there's no fucking around.

Speaker 6:          02:30:53       You just get to business, bang it out as much as possible. I think it's, I think for you, maybe you could work it, but for me, I think they're, they're, they're, they have a shell. I'm there to get them going, set them up. I mean, you could just walk out and crush, but I feel like my job is to get them really rocking. So when you come up, it's a supercross involving me in fucking decisions that becoming an enabler here. Not at all. Um, I, uh, I vote like Ari and I had this conversation once and uh, you know, he was like, uh, you know, we'll sort of do, should I go up and do my best stuff? I says, who gives a fuck it do whatever you want to do, I guess is your time when you're up there 20 minutes for half an hour.

Speaker 6:          02:31:34       I mean, I wouldn't want you to flatline, but you don't want to flat line, flat line of purpose. And there's nothing wrong with like taking chances. I don't know. I just find it like, I don't know when people are playing that kind of money that they want to show, they do want to show, but that's part of a live show. Sometimes shit goes wrong. There's nothing wrong with that. It's you can get out of it. You're a fucking pro. You've been doing comedy for almost two decades. You can pull yourself out of any downward spiral. You know? It's not like you can't like open up and fuck around, but with reo is like you can't get fired, so just go fuck around. Right. It doesn't matter. It's like you're going to have a good set. No, I totally understand that. And that's the, I think that's the sort of mindset that you have to have to do like wild standup.

Speaker 6:          02:32:15       Right. You know when you, when you play it safe, the problem with playing it safe is you have that mentality of planet. Say, I've never played it safe. That's kind of why I am who I am. That is who you are, who you are. What are you Jesse? James Motherfucker. I told, look, gangster Duncan fire. That's how I am ma'am. It Papa. That's what I do. I do it. Slash. Uh, what was the girl? I don't know. Maybe. I just think theater shows. I meant to bring the heat from the wood. Of course you do. You still, everybody should bring the heat. What was it? Was that girl not jewel 80 per cow. You're either eating for Keller. Popeye. Yeah. I'm bringing the woods. That's who I am bringing the who brings the woods. You'll bring in the wood. Yeah. What does that even mean? Bringing the back.

Speaker 6:          02:32:57       I'm bringing the woe. You bring it to bat baseball term. I understand my name, my new album that you guys are both very funny in Sacramento was fucking awesome. It was a great show, man. Yeah, those crowds are a amazingly awesome. They're like the nicest fucking people in the history of the world. It's the weirdest thing and we keep harping on it and saying how much we appreciate it, but just because we're all blown away by it, I've never had a nicer crowds. So we talk about the woman who got mad at you about bees yet. Jesus, I got a picture of her crazy Vegan lady got mad cause I was making fun. Upbeat. She was vegan cheese. You said she was, what? Was she vegan or who she was as people got mad on other people's behalfs no, she was, I was talking about the whole thing about being, one of the things that's most silly about vegans is the ones who won't eat honey cause they don't want bees to be enslaved.

Speaker 6:          02:33:46       So I go, I have this giant fucking bit about bees and includes like real facts about bees. It's hilarious. I can't wait to do it again. Can we do a Wednesday night, the ice house or Friday night in Massey Hall in Toronto. Um, but anyway, this lady, it was like all vegan doubt and she got fucking really bummed out at my, my, my lack of respect of B's. She's walked out. She was shit face too. And people will tell you like, you know bs really are important man. Yeah, I know. Guess what? I have no bearing on whether or not bees live or die. I'm just doing comedy. You fuckhead

Speaker 7:          02:34:18       well take, just to get mad at that. It's like, does this lady get mad every time she watches a movie and someone gets shot and killed? Like does she really think that person got shot and killed or the director really wants that person to get shot and killed. It's like, why is it with comedy? They take it so literally. It's not they, it's just a few dummies and they have 1200 people in a room. You're going to get a few

Speaker 6:          02:34:39       dummies. She also said to you, she was mad at you for, for Liking Sarah Pailin though. So I was like, wait, I think maybe you are drunk and a, you shouldn't be that. Her sister was hot and I don't say that. I like Sarah Palin. I say Sarah Palin. It's just a misinformed Dominique is probably a nice person, you know? She's probably not a bad person. There's really not that much bad on her. Her ideas are stupid, but there's a lot of people too, but ideas and you could probably drink with them and have a good time and they're fine, you know, that's all I said. Silly bitch of the clock. Me Out was five. She probably was just super attracted to you and just get so angry. Well she's probably attracted to you and she knew you could, she couldn't get. Yeah, so she decided to turn it on me. Oh well that happens a lot. I wish I could do that. Happens a lot. Henry Middle Eastern looking motherfucker. She was still shit face. She was talking to me and red band before she succumbed off. Not knowing that we were in the show. She just, she just talking shit. Solace. Oh Susie. That's right. Well why don't you just close the deal right there in the hallway. Oh, I remember. I tried to kiss her.

Speaker 6:          02:35:47       You have the worst Karma ever. If it comes to like girls being open to seeing how far can it go with it. Girls Fall in love with though. I love that though. Let me kiss you. That's, uh, just put it out there. Well, if you say to a girl like that, she might just stab you and I know what the fuck was going on in that girl's head. You're playing with, you're playing with a wild animal, but that's why he's attracted to, Oh, you attracted to it like crazy bitches. What did you just ask that? How long have you known Brad? I'm trying to get them to talk. Okay. Fuck is wrong with you. Cock blocker. Jesus Christ. Here's her, her. Here's that girl by the way. Ruined up though. It's sideways. That's her face melting. What's going on with that? And when you eat a lot of carrots, sometimes you face can just fall off. Crazy. Silly pitch. There's a lot of them out there. She's probably going to sue you now though. Huh? Now she doesn't have a Twitter. She doesn't have a Twitter, but she's going to hear about this man. She had friends at the show. I'm sure they got mad and she,

Speaker 7:          02:36:39       no, she works out in like a UFC gym, right? Yeah. Did she say that? Yeah.

Speaker 6:          02:36:43       Well she needs bees. Julie. I'm really bummed out fucking some shit from everybody. Fucking bees across her sister was hot lead, just a fat tats all over her tits. She had fantastic.

Speaker 7:          02:36:56       Yeah. Just up to big fat tat over big fat tick. What was the tattoo off? It's always a heart with some kind of angel wings with some kind of like, uh,

Speaker 6:          02:37:06       uh, I dunno. Shrubbery shrubberies Hardy's pubic hair. That's always like some leaves and shit. Right. What's with the leaves? There's always like some kind of thorns or something. My heart fly, but it's in a cage that's just saying Ron fucking run. Did you, what do you, what do you know about this Julian Assange case? Do you know about this at all? Is that this guy? The founder? Yeah. That he put out a bunch of, uh, classified documents. Right. And they're trying to, they're trying to send him to Sweden. I tried on some sort of a sexual assault trial. Well, the latest is that there's no DNA, uh, the link in the condom to, uh, that's central to their sexual assault case. There's no DNA. Lincoln, it might not even be him. The whole thing is amazing. The guys held up at the Ecuador embassy and they're talking about storming the NSC and the, the premise is this case, this case, this sexual assault case, and now the, the latest is that a, a a condom given the Swedish police by one of the Julian Assange, his accuser does not contain the wikileaks founders DNA forensic evidence have found and they reportedly found and the banks have cut off any funding to wikileaks.

Speaker 6:          02:38:25       They, you can no longer donate to keep it going. And it's all, yeah, that makes sense. It's a smear campaign. He likes us a smear campaign. They're trying to just like squish this guy up on Jack Em. I mean, who knows what they're gonna do to them. If they decided to put them in a Swedish jail, he's probably dead. They'll probably kill them, you know, they'll just, they'll just have, you know, some prison uprising, let some dudes into his jail and give them free cigarettes if they've stumped him to death. I mean it's to bring the wood, he's going to bring the wood, like that scene in breaking bad. And you ever seen like the last, the are you giving spoilers from breaking bad? Don't do that. What the fuck? Not My podcast buddy. Not this one. I my podcast. All right, I'll just sit here quietly.

Speaker 6:          02:39:08       Shut the fuck up. Sam's know about balls are all about balls and monkey and bringing wood. Um, I gotta apologize to Mac Danzig. Mack Danzig did a podcast with me and the beginning of it, I got the audio of it and it, um, it wasn't going up on the audio, wasn't going up to Ustream for [inaudible]. Brian was there. And so the, the second part of it, well, I'm saying it wasn't your fault, it was my fault. And then the second part of it that the file's corrupt. So it's fucking, what's really crazy is Mac Danzig had the same problem with Ari Shaffir. He did a podcast with Ari Shaffir is haunted and yeah, and, and Ari had the podcast and deleted it accidentally and then emptied his trash and then freaked out that he couldn't get it back. Even tried to bring to, I think he tried to use like a data finding program, but the point is Mac Danzig might be haunted when it comes to podcasts. We're going to make it up to him and he's going to come back in on things random fucking with them actually, you know, he doesn't, he knows it would come in to punch me, but he's a super inch. He's a super interesting guy, so it'll be fun to talk to them again anyway. He's a really good, really good fight coming up. Does it? He does. Isn't

Speaker 1:          02:40:14       even find somebody a, I thought it was a really good match up. Yeah. I want to say it's a Japanese fighter. Oh yeah, it is gummy tucking away goes. Yeah, that's a good fight. Great. Fine. Yeah. Yeah. He's fine. A saccharine to two of the great. Um, uh, Japanese fighters are sac saccharine and Tucking Origami. The great fighters of the, especially with the last generation, you know, and go me stills, big knockout puncher. It's knocked out Tyson Griffin. Shorter arms though, right? I think that's what I've seen with Asians, that they tend to have to shorter arms, do racism. When you were talking to USC on my podcast, Sam tripled none of a bitch. He's going for the cheap laugh and making fun of the Asians arm length.

Speaker 7:          02:40:54       Yes. I'm saying that's a big reason why.

Speaker 1:          02:40:57       Okay. Who's that basketball player? What's his name? Jeremy Lin. The you're fucking your arguments.

Speaker 7:          02:41:01       The wind. No, but I'll tell you about a Yo Ming. He looks like a t rex. He's tall with these huge legs. He's got short, shorter arms. Fuck up. He does not have short arms. Arms. No, he doesn't. Not for his. Bottle him up. Brian. Pull them up. Pull them up full. Okay, now I'm going for three for three. You're going to go down. You're going to go down with this one. This one. I swear to God. I'm telling you, I've watched this guy play basketball forever. He's not. His arms are proportional to his body. Like Blake Griffin. I'm telling, having super long arms. You are no judge of symmetry and human beings. I watch, I learn. I love [inaudible]. I bring the wood. I bring the wood.

Speaker 1:          02:41:44       Yo, Ming is yelling. Which one is the, the really tall guys. He's the biggest guy. Yeah, he's, he was the seven. Six Guy said he's seven foot seven. That seems like pretty

Speaker 7:          02:41:54       decent. No, but you're Scott, right? Shut the fuck up. Sam. Sam, Sam, Sam, Sam. That is,

Speaker 1:          02:42:04       or that guy is in proportion. There's nothing is proportionate about his build at all. You're so silly now. I can't listen to you and trust you on anything because we've got clear photographic evidence that shows you your shitty theory is no good and you're, you're rejecting it. You're rejecting in front of all these people on the inside.

Speaker 7:          02:42:22       Yes I am. I'm saying that only that very short on your, the fuck he does sound. You're wrong. Sam. This is the shit observation. I wish you'd brings observation on stage and have people stare at you and go, no, no. He doesn't know. You know, it's like, crowd is nice.

Speaker 1:          02:42:41       You can say like, lady Gaga has a big nose and people go, you know what? She's done. She's really hot, but she does kind of have a big nose. You cannot say y'all oming is short arms.

Speaker 7:          02:42:49       Do the scouting report of Y'all Maine coming into the draft and they will say tall guy. We short proportionally shorter arms.

Speaker 1:          02:42:58       Awesome. How do you spell me? Why a Oh Maine and I end machine proportionately short on pro pour tea.

Speaker 3:          02:43:12       Short arms. Let's say.

Speaker 6:          02:43:19       How good would yell Ming be if his arms were longer? Yeah, arms are pretty short for his height, but he still has one of the highest. Okay. This is inside hoops. They're too short for his height. Are you serious?

Speaker 7:          02:43:36       Yes. Give me back my point. Let me see. I need to see some more photos of him cause that looked normal to me. That look normal. This can be just some racist bullshit. When he got, when he was getting drafted. Date said that his arms long man. Brian, I think we need to Google. Yeah.

Speaker 6:          02:43:58       Yo Ming. Uh, images. Y'All Ming short arms.

Speaker 7:          02:44:03       Yeah. What are you going to eyeball it?

Speaker 6:          02:44:05       Yes and no. I don't trust all these racists on wine.

Speaker 7:          02:44:07       Shit. What's up to the giant Chinese man? hoops.com is a racist web. Clearly they know what kind of man. No, take away. Nobody said China, man.

Speaker 6:          02:44:18       I'm measuring. It is correct that using this measure yells arms are proportionally shorter than the average. This is another one. This is Yao Ming Mania. Okay. No, no, no. This is just a forum. Chantel. Yeah. How long are y'all means arms wiki answers seven foot. Six inches. Wow. That's pretty long. You could really say those are short. Do this seven foot, six inch arms. That's crazy. Well, isn't that always the case that your reach is like exactly. No, it's not. No. There's some guys who have, just like a lot of these NBA players now, they have these incredibly long length long reaches a guy named like Elton brand who's six, five but he has a seven to wingspan. Right. That's like the same thing with Jon Jones. Jon Jones is six four but he's got a wingspan of like a seven foot tall guy. The what is that? Is that like an extra wide shoulders that propelled the arms out or is it the arm actually is longer.

Speaker 6:          02:45:18       I think they probably a little both. A little. Both. Yeah, because dudes who have short shoulders definitely always have like a shorter reach. And guys like Tommy Hearns where like real wide backs, you know, had a longer reach on top of the fact that he was tall and had long limbs. This guy that just got drafted, number one, Anthony Davis, his wingspan, it's like a terror dactyl it's huge. Did I think you get a point for that? I think we've got to give a point back to AAA. I think you already did you already give it to me. I'll be going to give him a ding. They'll give him a dang. But the thing, I'll take it then because yeah. Um, the, um, people online are saying that and there's no like experts, but enough people in our line of saying it that I would see. And that's why when I go me is a great fighter. I just think he has a short reach. Yeah. Well,

Speaker 1:          02:46:10       he's uh, he, um, is a really good wrestler and one of the things that he does with a lot of good wrestlers do they develop that, that jump, that leap forward with our power double, you know, are Aa takedowns and when they, you know, they developed that in intense explosion forward, they put that in there punch and that's what go me does, he throws punches like a fast ball. I think you actually was a pitcher at one point in time as well. Um, wow. Okay. There's all, there's also people that say he's not disproportionally short. Huh? Uh, no. Yeah. It's not particularly strong. His height long arms. Who says that? Dude, I just, I if you go back to his whole thing, I will just make this up. Uh, yeah. Maine has a wingspan that is shorter. Yeah. Some of them say it's not, it's really interesting. Okay. That's, it's not, it's, it seems to be what people like to say.

Speaker 1:          02:47:14       I think that's a point. Yeah. It's easier that people like to say, but also people like to dispute it. So I googled it both ways. I Google not proportionally shorter. You actually watched him play? You could tell he has short arms for his height. You could tell. You could tell when he went to go block a uh, I don't care. Okay. Well I'm still fighting for my point. Why do you want it so bad? Cause I just, I just know. Um, every statement I make is going to be Google or Wikipedia and I like to go three for three. So do you think you would be better? I mean I think it got us a tall, basically just came, hold the ball above everybody's head and it gets a certain point when dudes are like 10 feet tall. Yeah. But we still gonna use the same height.

Speaker 1:          02:47:53       Basketball cause they've already talked about moving it up a foot. Five minute warning. All right, let's wrap this pitch up. We uh, yeah because at one point in time, like no one was seven foot six, right? Yeah. Who's seven foot six? Just 10 years old was the tallest man in the world. When did he, when was he alive? Like the tall scowling worlds, like eight, six. But those are the guys with like fucked up pituitary glands. They're not like a Yao Ming who's like a functional normal dude who just happens to be gigantic. But you just, I mean like,

Speaker 10:         02:48:18       okay.

Speaker 1:          02:48:19       Kevin Garnett, when he came into Lee, he was like a seven footer who's built like a, uh, a normal, like a horse if I use proportionate so it could run no normal because before it was like these guys with these very long legs, right? Small Torsos. There was the first time it was like actual proportionate seven footers. Yeah. That pretty soon, that's the whole Mbas is going to be like all seven footers at every different position just with different strengths and weaknesses. And if they didn't have weight classes in the UFC, by the way, if the 265 pounds wasn't the heavyweight limit and the superhero heavyweight division, like those guys are going to dominate those. There's, there's gonna be some Chai Ganta anti human beings in the future, and they call it the monster weight division. Well, if there's enough fighters to, to have that sort of a weight division, they eventually will, you know.

Speaker 1:          02:49:05       Right now the reason why we haven't implemented it is because there's not really enough super heavyweight fighters to fill a whole division and they would be the cream of the crop, the super heavy, what would be the best, biggest, the best guy. But I think one day eventually that's going to happen, but he's in there. This whole fear that people wouldn't like try to make weight as much. Like you'd see guys who probably could fight at the heavyweight level, but they would like lean back, like kinda like big country who could be very dominant, two oh five but he prefers to stay at the heavyweight thing. You might see that a little bit more guys. If they could make it like a super heavyweight would go there instead of trying to make the way a heavy, we have a dude's can do whatever they want anyway.

Speaker 1:          02:49:41       You know, you could fight it, whatever weight class you want. I mean Bj Penn is fought heavyweight before Bj Penn fought Leo Machida essentially at heavyweight. Liotta was heavier than two oh five and they fought. So it's like, you know, if you want to get up to that weight class, as long as you weigh in more than two 65, you can find where the fuck you want. Well, if you're a guy like built like a guy like big country or if you build a good guy, like you know, Anderson Silva is lean and you can do whatever the fuck you want really. So it's this, I don't think there's any like fear of people like getting too big, but uh, I think it would be interesting to see big giant dudes this weekend and Montreal, or excuse me, in Toronto also is the UFC and the first ever UFC flyweight title will change hands.
