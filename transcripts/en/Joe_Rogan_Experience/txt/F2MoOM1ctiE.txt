That's o n n I t official sponsor of Tim Kennedy. We gotta figure out a way to sponsor fight is actually in the UFC. The UFC has a, there's a Mussel farm monopoly right now. We have to break that.

Speaker 2:          00:04:08       I don't care. I wouldn't care if it was actually good products, but muscle farm is not. I don't think so. I've never used it with protein powders and stuff like plastic that fills your stomach up. I don't know what his muscle farm. They make all the typical, you know, the pre workout, post workouts, proteins, toilet stuff, you know, like Jack's, your heart rate up to one 80 before your workout and then afterwards when it supposedly it tastes good. It's just full of sugar. I know. I've never had a good experience with a single muscle farm product. Obviously. I like on it.

Speaker 1:          00:04:41       Whoa. Tim Kennedy just laid down the law. How rude. Um, I have nothing bad to say. I'm about farm. I have no relationship with them. I have no experience with them, but I do have a deep, long and storied experience with on it. Uh, our protein powder is 100 percent natural and also 100 percent sugar free. The only sugar is one gram of sugar, which is naturally occurring per serving. That comes from the hemp. I have to answer this, I have to say this every episode, but just because I get asked all the time, if you eat him, you will not test positive for marijuana. Hemp does not have any thc in it. But again, if you read poppy seed Bagels, you will test positive for heroin. It sounds crazy, but it's totally true. Hemp force, we use the finest available protein powder that we can buy, which we have to buy from Canada because the laws are fucking goofy in America and we're not allowed to grow hemp.

Speaker 1:          00:05:33       We can buy it, but we can't support American farmers, which drives me fucking crazy. Hopefully laws have been changed and hopefully soon we will be able to support farmers and by our own when we're supporting Canadian farmers, but we'll hopefully be able to support American farmers and maybe even get our own hemp farm. Right now though. It's a little too sketchy and I don't want to go to jail, so we buy it and then we sell it. We sell the best shit that we can find, whether it's strength and conditioning equipment. We sell a need, just the finest kettlebells and steel maces and clubs, weight vest. If we find something and it's good, we find something. It's beneficial, whether it's a supplement or a food. We sell it and we try to get it at the most reasonable rates possible and we find the best quality stuff. Whatever it is, whether it's the best quality protein powders, where's the best quality walnut, almond cashew butter, anything we sell raw organic coconut oil. We just try to sell the best shape available and we try to sell it to you as cheaply as possible. If you use the code name Rogan, you will save 10 percent off any and all supplements. Tim Kennedy is here. Let's cue the music. Why fuck around

Speaker 1:          00:06:49       the Joe Rogan experience.

Speaker 3:          00:06:52       Joe Rogan podcast. Jim Kennedy, ladies and Gentlemen, I've been wanting to talk to you for awhile. Dude, you're an interesting cat. You've been around the world saying that you laughing like you're not.

Speaker 2:          00:07:05       Nope. No, I'm not laughing that I'm, I'm, uh, interesting. Uh, but I had wanted to talk to you in the octagon for a really long time. So we took a while. It didn't take long time like wow, 12 years as a pro to finally get a little

Speaker 1:          00:07:17       Jill interview. But the interview was a, you couldn't ask for a better environment to do that first interview, do it when the UFC fight for the troops, you know, to do it and do it after that spectacular knockout. And that was intense man and it, it wasn't just intense because you won. What was really intense for me is, um, and I've always experienced this in these fights for the troops. First of all, it's great to be able to go to them and put on these fights and have them in these hangers and that these tight environments and just the appreciation and the respect that everybody has for the fighters is really intense. But you eat, first of all, you being a veteran and you, you being unabashed in your love for soldiers and your respect for your, your, your fellow military members. When you got on top of that cage and after, you know, they were all cheering and you were yelling out to all those people that you love them. I mean this is all off camera, man. We'd cut to commercial and you're on top of the cage and you're just yelling and all those people letting them know that you loved them. That was some intense, intense shit.

Speaker 2:          00:08:26       Yeah. Overwhelming emotional near shutdown. Yeah. I'm walking out to the cage. I see this dude. He flies for the one 60th, which is like the special forces wing of aviation. The last time I saw that dude was handing him my shot buddy. You know, I'm like, it's a big thing in special forces community. We're real tight, you know, like I'm handing him my brother that has bullet holes in him and I'm a. and I'm like, I don't wanna let him go. And he's like, Hey, I got this. This is what I do. You go do what you're supposed to do and get back to work. That was the last time I saw this dude was handing him my buddy on a medivac. Then I'm walking out of the cage and I was like, Holy Shit. There is that dude from the 68 that I handed my shot buddy to totally overwhelming. They have to go in there and fight. And then uh, you know, Nice. Fifth Special Forces group is co located there. So I saw a bunch of dudes from like the Green Brae regiment. That was entirely too much emotion. I just wanted to curl up and cry.

Speaker 1:          00:09:22       Yeah, it's a completely different kind of. There's you on top of the cage up there in that photo. That's just an intense, intense picture. That picture should be framed and on your wall somewhere because that is one of the greatest pictures have ever seen. Have you could cut me out and just have the dudes, Nah, Nah, Nah, Nah, Nah. You need to be in there for reference. I mean, but that's your attitude. What you just said, cut me out and leave the dudes that there really is your attitude. You really don't want that. You were saying while you were up there that my job is, is in here is easy. What you guys do. You guys are my heroes. You good memory? Yeah. I remember everything. It's disturbing. Scary. Don't get in a fight with Joe Rogan verbally not go well for you. I remember things well.

Speaker 1:          00:10:04       I remember important things and that was a, that was a deep moment. You know, there was um, I wrote a thing a long time ago about, uh, one of the fights for the troops about the, uh, the national anthem. And I recorded it. I filmed it on my phone when someone was singing the national anthem and you turn around and you know, I was filming the crowd while it was all going on and the feeling the air, the electricity in the air of hearing the national anthem while you were around. Active duty soldiers who are in a war currently have had friends who had loved ones die, have experienced firefights have been there if comeback. And now they're here in time off getting to enjoy a fight. And everyone's standing up in this whole tricity in the air. Man, you're fucking. EHRS are standing up on your back. It's crazy. It's, it's intense. It's intense. Two totally different experience.

Speaker 2:          00:10:57       It's there. I don't know. I don't understand the whole realm outside of like what you can physically see, but there is no way to describe, you know, like moments like that where you're surrounded by these heroes that these selfless freaking superstars of humanity and um, you know, they bleed in every sense of the word for their country. And then the national anthem, Kamala and, or the flag goes up and you see them all and there, there's, there's this energy there that just can't be described. It can only be experienced. It's surreal,

Speaker 1:          00:11:27       you know, that's the, that's the really intense, uh, aspect of it is that there's, there's a lot of resistance and blow back towards war and towards the military industrial complex and towards, both of which are horrible. Yeah. But what the, what's important is the people ever. Everybody wants everything to be black and white and there's no black and white in this world. There's this gigantic of shades and there's. There's positive and there's negative, there's good and there's bad, but there are real heroes in the world. I'm Pat Tillman is a perfect example of a guy who was a real hero in my opinion. A guy who saw what was going on and said, you know what? Fuck this NFL career. I don't need millions of dollars when I needed to do is do what's right and I need to fight for my country. He goes over there and then when he gets there, he experienced chaos and nonsense and he's super vocal about it and completely as is his brother and that's to me a perfect example of that.

Speaker 1:          00:12:27       There is no black and white. There's a lot of. There's real heroes. There's people that have heroic content and there's people that have heroic ideals and they really do love and respect the idea of freedom, but they get thrust into a situation where everything is completely out of control and chaotic and a garlic. Pat Tillman was very vocal about it and well spoken, very well spoken as is his brother, you know, it's, it's a very intense thing and when, you know, people were anti war and you know, it's, it's, it's Kinda, it's fashionable to be anti war, you know, it's a thing that a lot of people put on, like an outfit. They just sort of jump into the sentiment that we shouldn't have a military and we shouldn't have wore. The real problem is human beings are still animals and a lot of research, a lot of respects, a lot of senses and probably nobody knows that more than a guy like you who's been there.

Speaker 2:          00:13:23       War is horrible. I hate war. I am anti war. I've been anti war my whole entire life with, you know, uncles that fought in world war two or in Vietnam, you know, grandparents that fought in world war two. Um, but with that position of being anti war, I don't think you should be able to be anti war unless you understand at a fundamental level how awful and horrible war is not. That doesn't mean they have to go and serve. But, um, it's necessary, you know, it's, um, I don't, I wouldn't wish what I've seen in my life on my worst enemy, you know, there's no way I'd want the people. I hate to have to see know what a little girl looks like when she's been, had acid thrown on her because she tried to go to school. I want that, want that on my worst enemy. But, um, there's people that do those things, you know, there's people that go and kidnap 300 girls in school this week because they were going to school, you know, those people don't. They have to answer to somebody and the only people they would answer to or guys like me or guys that are better than me that are still doing it. And uh, and it's a necessary evil. You know, you fight fire with fire, you fight evil with just a more violent, better version of evil, which is,

Speaker 1:          00:14:36       that's a crazy way to look at the world. But in a lot of respects, there's no other options. And in some situations there are no other options unless you let evil, overwhelming area or evil overwhelm a group of innocent people. There's almost no. And to denied the existence of evil is completely fucking ridiculous. Especially if you just look at human history, look at human history from recorded times, from the beginning when people started writing things down. People always did awful shit. If they could get away

Speaker 2:          00:15:07       to get away from, get away with it. For evil to prevail all it takes us for good men to do nothing. Right? So great quote. Yeah. Just have to do something even if it's horrible. How long were you over there for? I was eight years active duty, um, special forces. And now it's been three years as a national guardsman in special forces. And how old are you now? Thirty four.

Speaker 1:          00:15:31       So wow. So you were really young, so you're, you're essentially like college age?

Speaker 2:          00:15:36       Yeah, as soon as I was in Grad school when I enlisted. And how old were you then? I was 22. Wow.

Speaker 1:          00:15:44       So you, you saw what was going on and you just decided that this was calling you.

Speaker 2:          00:15:51       It was a balance. It was like the perfect storm for me, for me to go in. I was, I was kind of, this was before it. We'll call, we'll call it pro. I was a pro MMA fighter and I had five fights as foreign one, you know, I just won this ECC, 50 big eight men tournament, you know, Jason Miller, Dennis Kang, myself, we're all in it. And I was the one that won it. So like I had good promise. Um, I was a Douche bag. I was a little idiot in San Luis Obispo. We know with the entire, the Mecca of fighting at the time. I'm like worrying about what genes I was going to wear to the next party, you know, like, oh, I want to with my next winnings from this fight, I'm going to go buy these something stupid. Did you have genes that are already ripped? Oh yeah, absolutely.

Speaker 2:          00:16:37       Can I pay way too much for really crappy genes? That looks cool. Anyways, so make it a lot of poor decisions. And, you know, nine slash 11 happened and it was just one of those instances that's a godsend. Divine intervention may be where you get this extra central perspective of how much of an idiot you are. And that's what I had. I was like, God, I am really one of the worst people on the planet. Um, you know, not being a productive, contributing member to society in any way, just being a succubus of life. And so I walked down after nine slash 11 to the recruiter's office and the pro, I wish I could just knock on the door, but that wasn't the issue. The issue was that there was like a thousand other dudes in line ahead of me that I wanted to do the same thing. And just to give you a testament about how amazing the backbone of our country still is.

Speaker 1:          00:17:22       What was that feeling like when you showed up and you see a thousand other

Speaker 2:          00:17:26       that are wrapping around the supermarket have the same mentality? How humbling, you know, we're like, again, I'm still still a little fucked hard, you know? Um, I was like, thinking us, I'm going to go enlist, you know, when I get down there, I was like, man, I should've been here like five hours ago, you know, and uh, instance after instance. Yeah, it cool. It was amazing. It was humbling is what it was to see all these dudes ahead of you that um, their instant reaction, you know, it wasn't a little retrospective perspective of like what you're doing in your life. It was like, fuck this. Those dudes just flew planes into our buildings. I'm going, you know, that's, that's what they were where I was a little bit late. So I think just the response is humbling. Yeah, it's very tricky because the people that flew the planes are already dead, right?

Speaker 2:          00:18:14       So, but the, the idea that there is a faction of the world that's planning things along these lines and it's willing to go to such extreme lengths when you, when you see shit like that happen in the world and you see it from a perspective of an outsider versus seeing it from a perspective of someone who's actually there and in the military, what, what is the difference? What is the feeling like? Like it's once you became active duty, once you're there, what is the difference in your perspective? Uh, you know, nine slash 11. I think everybody remembers exactly where they were. You know, I'm no different. I remember the exact place that I was and exactly what I was doing. Um, you know, and I remember my response being anger, you know, like I wanted to lash out and revenge. I don't have that, that's not in me anymore.

Speaker 2:          00:19:07       Like I don't, I never respond that way anymore. When I see things happen. I almost had like this cold calculated response, you know, like, um, you know, I hear about something happening and I don't want to go over with a baseball bat and smashed a bunch of dudes heads in like I did, you know, 12 years ago now. It's like when bin Laden was killed, you know, I spent some prime years of my life and mountains of Afghanistan, Pakistan looking for that, that idiot. And um, and then navy seals go in and get them, you know, and I was like, Dang, I missed it. You know, I was kind of sad. I wasn't mad. I wasn't angry. I didn't want to be there. I don't want to shoot it myself. But I was like, Oh man, you didn't want to shoot them yourself. I'm not, I would love to have shot him myself, but I wasn't mad that I didn't get to, which was my response, you know, 11, 12 years ago just calculated like, ah, man, that whole event was one of the biggest, like what do you think really happened?

Speaker 2:          00:20:06       Conspiracies online when they didn't show the body and they threw it in the ocean. And the whole idea that he was going to be a martyr like that was so perplexing to me. The whole thing was so completely perplexing to me. Like why wouldn't you just show his body like, can we, can we take a look? The whole world wants to see the bad guy when you, when you just historically through the course of this war, when we've done it on numerous instances, whether it's Saddam hanging or Zarqawi and it's blown up body. Like some. I was involved with someone I wasn't. It's been, it's been very clear the response by the fanatic side when they see the body, you know, maybe that person becomes a martyr,

Speaker 3:          00:20:48       you know, and then then he's like idolized for years or maybe it just incites and immediate riot. So yeah, it sucks. We want to have that justice feeling of like the conclusion that, you know, like the finale of like, ah, there's been lot and he's dead. Look at that point. The beard of his. That's definitely him. Alright, we can sleep at night. You know, the Boogeyman bin Ladin it's not under the bed. But had they done that, the repercussions would have been so much more severe with riots and possibly, you know, a longstanding martyrdom. So I don't know. Yeah, I know what you're saying. Shades of gray, like you said, it sucks. Yeah, I'm selfish. Yeah. I want to see the dead body. And plus I don't totally believe everything they say. So you know, when you, when you talked to high ranking, military guys would say, that guy's been dead forever.

Speaker 3:          00:21:36       He's been dead a long time ago. That was another part of the conspiracy guys that were in the know is saying, I think that guy was dead already. There's no way that he's still alive because we've probably killed him like 10 times now. So whether this was the final version of him or the 10th, it's irrelevant. All versions have been loud and her dead. Yeah. He's not Jason. I'm going to pop up out of the ocean the 11th time. Swim to shore. A to bitch. Yeah. Let's start from scratch. The idea is a terrifying to us, like fanatical religious fundamentalists that are willing to die is terrifying for a good reason. It's one of the worst aspects of human beings is that we can talk people and to believe in some completely ridiculous shit and talk them into believing it so much so that they're willing to kill themselves and we all.

Speaker 3:          00:22:25       The other problem with human beings is that once a guy gets that far, once it got once a human man, woman, whatever it was that far gone, how do you bring it back? I don't. I have a friend who has adopted a child and I'm. The kid was a, I think she was probably three when they adopted her and she's six now and the poor kid's a mess, you know? And they really worried. They don't know what she experienced a lot of abuse before they ever got to her and now she's six years old and they're just trying to wrangle her and educator and give her love and give her. But they were like, God damn, if we just got there sooner, that's the idea. You're talking about three years old, you know, get some guy who's fucking 30 and he's all. I walk by all day, you know, bowing and ready to be a martyr, and it's fucking. It's impossible to change the course of that sort of ideology. Yeah. I have no idea how, if you're smart, ecstasy, mushrooms, isolation, reprogramming some of the solution was way easier. I'm definitely more repercussions. Yeah. Well, you know what? We're all going to live. We're all going to die. And you gotta pull weeds out of a garden. Sometimes. That's just the reality

Speaker 1:          00:23:46       of the situation. The idea of equating a human being like a weed. It's pretty gross, but it's just a bad analogy. We're not all flowers. Yeah. I don't think you're a flower a. no, I don't think I'm a flower. I'm a vegetable. Some sort of. I'm already choke. I have. Layers are great. I love artichokes. I'm like a pineapple. I'm rough on the outside, but inside I'm delicious, but the core is really hard as well. So. Yeah. Well, and it's you deep inside. I'm very fibrous. Once he gets good metaphor. I like it. Um, so you were over there and uh, you continued your mixed martial arts training while you were over there as well.

Speaker 2:          00:24:28       Yeah. Special Forces as a whole. Like there's the expectation that all of us are just good fighters. Like we're just born bad asses that obviously this is not the case, right? Nobody is. So we train, you know, we shoot all day long and morning and night. We fight know, usually pet is some form of Jujitsu, boxing, wrestling, kickboxing, hand to hand combat, small arms and then evening is more recreational. You know, after you get back from the rain show, you get up, you work out, then you go to the range and shoot for, you know, three, four hours, go back, clean the guns, and then your evening is usually on the mat. That's Monday through Thursday. Friday is you're trying to fix whatever you broke during the week.

Speaker 1:          00:25:10       That's the week. So do you guys, when, when they set up training for you, whether it's physical martial arts training or fitness training, as is their instructors who are, who set a program for you? Like how does, how does it work?

Speaker 2:          00:25:25       So sometimes you bring in experts, you know, hoists Gracie came in, trained us, I can't, countless times, you know, Greg Jackson comes out still, um, you know, guys like, uh, I'm Greg Thompson, you know, he's a hoist black belt. He's there permanently. So there there's permanent fixtures at the special forces installations that train guys on a daily basis and they have relationships to bring in experts. Um, obviously you know, what you do in a house when to blow a door in, when you're going inside on kill. Capture mission is different than you're going to do in the cage. So it has to be guys that can adapt whatever they're teaching or know what their limitations are. You know, Greg Jackson doesn't go in there and, and try to teach knife fighting, you know, he knows what his left and right limits are, but he comes, you know, he's one of the best. So he comes in and gives, gives the best instruction that he can to try to provide tools for, for guys to be better at what they do. You train a lot down there in Albuquerque? I do, yeah. He's a fascinating guy. He is, he is a cool cat.

Speaker 1:          00:26:24       He's a one of a very unique dude, like really humble, like really humble. Like there's a lot of people that pretend to be humble, but if you took away Adam, you pick away at them and you find some bullshit. It's just putting on a. Now he's humble to a fault to a fault. Yeah. How so?

Speaker 2:          00:26:39       Um, he and Winkeljohn I say humble to a fault where they have a, they have all these things to give. They're the best that there has ever been on coaching staff. The train more champions. They have the best stable of fighters on the planet arguably. And they're still training guys, you know, and it's not been designed and this is just out of like a almost necessity at this scary staff now. It's not even scared. I don't know. I'm out of a Bar, barn warehouse, industrial, commercial,

Speaker 2:          00:27:18       ghetto building, you know, like where I can walk out the door and score some meth as fast as I can come inside and get around with John Jones, you know, those are my options. Front door parking lot. Get some meth. Come in. It's that bad. A neighborhood. Oh yeah, absolutely. Yeah. You ever see is the outside? Yeah. No, no. Jackson winkeljohn driving down central. It's like you can count anywhere from four to eight transvestites any given morning and then variety of. Yeah, there's a, there's a famous one named grace. She's this beautiful black girl that wears this huge wig and she's like four or five inches taller than I am and probably 50 pounds bigger than I am. Whoa. Yeah. And, but it's, you know, he bring her in. I know she's amazing. Scary guy can bring her in and every corner is like, oh, there's that drug dealer, there's this drug dealer.

Speaker 2:          00:28:07       And then you're like, wait, is that the guy from breaking bad? No. Maybe it is. Is He really selling meth? And then the irony is there. No, that is not the guy from breaking bad, but he's really selling meth and he's dressed like the guy from breaking bad. Wow. Yeah. That is what it's like. They're albuquerque is a weird spot. It is cookie. Why do they stay? It's just because the gyms there and yeah. Good. Stable of tough guys there. I mean I would love it if Mike Winkeljohn, Greg Jackson, you know, let's say we're in Austin, Texas or la or San Louis Obispo, but they're in Albuquerque, New Mexico, so that's where I go. If they're in Idaho, that's where I would go, but that's where they are. So you're trained in Austin during your time in between fights? Yes. How do you, uh, how do you like plan out?

Speaker 2:          00:28:50       Like, like when, like how many weeks do you give yourself when you go to albuquerque? I get six weeks. Six good weeks and Albuquerque, um, so, you know, hopefully you'll get 10 week heads up, heads up to your fight. So then I have four weeks to start doing pre fight camp, develop like strength, speed, explosion type physical stuff, working on specific techniques and then moved to albuquerque for the six weeks for the kind of final fight. Can you train it? A great spot in Austin too. I was down there. I'm really recently and I met the owner of that facility with what's that got stolen? Parks and polio. Brandao yeah. Great facility. Amazing. Yeah. Really Nice guys too. Yep. And um, so you do just all your most inbetween fight preparation. They're good group of fighters out there as well. Yeah. Side Austin elite. Justin Lake was my strength and conditioning coach.

Speaker 2:          00:29:44       He's like my brother on a whole bunch of different levels. He married my sister or my, um, my wife's sister, um, where you used to go to college together. We used to hang out with the same girls together and then we enlisted together. He went to special forces. We went to some group together, went to Afghanistan together and then he married my sister in law. He might be stocking, you know, I hope not because he's like 200 pounds. The snatches 250 pounds dead lift, 500 pounds. It would be a bad thing if he was stalking me. Does. Is he finding his. He do, man. No, just trains. Just trains. Yeah. There's a lot of those dudes that are scary that just trying to please, please don't ever get mad at me, tear my limbs off and beat me. How did you get hooked up with a Jackson Winkeljohn? When I, when I lost the strikeforce title to Jacques Rey, um, it was, it was a really close fight, very close fight. I thought you won. I thought I did too, but it was close and there was just small adjustments I needed to make and adjustments that w that I wasn't making on my own. I needed somebody that was smarter than me to tell me what those were and how to, and how to prepare for them. Um, you know, so since then, um, what seven and one since I went there,

Speaker 1:          00:30:59       you Jackson is an interesting guy in that he didn't have any professional mma fights, but he's a virtuoso. I mean he really is like, I've had long conversations with him about strategy and weird shit about music, about how, you know, he listens to symphonies and compares the rhythm of symphonies to the, the, the changing rhythm of a fight.

Speaker 2:          00:31:23       He looks at everything as strategy, whether it's like he's playing lemmings, like the old school lemmings, you know, or is that, I don't even know what that is. Oh, it's a video game where you like move lemmings to certain portions of the map to try to achieve some stupid engineering goal. Um, it's very like archaic, like 16 bit game from like almost commodore 64 type things. Right? Like he still plays stat. Not often, but he's like, you know, everything has strategy, whether it's chess or backgammon, you know, or if he's like playing monopoly with a family, you know, it's like everything's about strategy. Nope.

Speaker 1:          00:31:57       We had a conversation with my friend Ari, my friend Ari Shaffir has a podcast called the skeptic tank and our, he's a really smart dude and him and Greg Jackson. Greg was his guest and Greg was like picking his brain about the comparisons, like trying to figure out how one crafts a piece of comedy and like tries to attack an audience with it. Like how you, how you get an idea past the boundaries of someone's consciousness. Could that be adaptive? Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:32:24       When you're talking to this audience, you already have the template of what you're trying to get to them, but then your response, their responsiveness, can you, can it change? Like I envisioned that is exactly something that Greg would do.

Speaker 1:          00:32:35       Yeah. Yeah. It's fascinating to listen to, to his, his mind because

Speaker 3:          00:32:39       I don't know anybody like him. It's a very unique sort of a mindset. And then Winkeljohn who's a great striking coach was a great kick boxer himself. You know, he's an interesting guy too.

Speaker 2:          00:32:50       Yeah. He's like the Yin to the Yang with Greg, you know, he's, he's a linear thinker, you know, he's um, he knows what you like, what Greg wants you to paint the best version of yourself. I'm winkle. John doesn't have that kind of responsive approach to you. He knows what you need to do to be better, you know, and he says, this is what you should do to be better. And this is what we're going to drill it relentlessly until your, you know, Greg's like, all right, like I want to see you develop this. Let me give you some tools so you can implement this in your fighting style. And it's going to be adaptive to every single different athletes that he has where winkle. John's like, no, this is what you need to do. And this is how we're going to do it. You're like, yes sir, please don't hurt me.

Speaker 3:          00:33:32       You know what I do? I look at what do I look at for folks who don't know, he lost an eye in training. Uh, someone, uh, they threw a kick and the toenail missed the pad and caught his eyeball, which is the first I've ever heard of that happening. However, I've heard of guys getting scratched badly and training from sparring, but never from holding pads. He wears safety glasses every time he holds. Now we asked him, can you see anything out of that other? No, definitely not. No. That the, the. I like poured out of his face. He was like, that's. That was my, I fuck. Safety tracks your toenails bitches. Seriously? Do I get on the mat fingernails and toenails and hygiene. Like, no, I'm not rolling with you. Go clean herself and trim that stuff. Yeah. I got one of the nastiest infections once from a guy peeling my hooks off and he had just giant fingernails.

Speaker 3:          00:34:26       Like I brought it out to the class. I'm like, come here folks, look at this. You can have, this is you're going to fuck everybody. It's not going to make you better fighter. We can't have this toenail clippers in my Jujitsu bag, belt headgear, mouthpiece, toenail clippers, and file them bitches to cut them. And then there's rough edges. File those bitches down. Yeah. When you see guys like about to go into the cage, and herb dean would look at their nails and then they're like, they bite. I'm like, no, this is not the time for that. You don't bite them down. Now you should have done that already.

Speaker 2:          00:34:59       Then you come home and your wife's like, why do you have scratches all over you? You're like,

Speaker 3:          00:35:03       I fight for a living. That's hilarious. Why are they on your back? Because someone who's fucking scratching my back. I didn't want them to the moon. Scratches o Tim. Oh, more. More? Yeah. Not Good. Um, is there a solution for fucking it pokes gloves? What? What should be done? Heaven forbid we ever say that anything was done better and pride. Their gloves are, they're better, right?

Speaker 2:          00:35:38       They're better. They're curved. Got like how many guys right now do you see with broken hands? A lot. It's like tons of them. So we have this padding on the two thirds of our hands. Right? Well that's not where we break our hands. We break her hands in the metacarpals in the back of the wrist or just above the wrist of the bottom. Your hand pride gloves had padding there which provided support. So it's a lot harder to break your hands. There are also, the pattern was curved so it was actually actually had to straighten your. I'm a grappler obviously, you know, like I like to grapple. So as a grappler I could complain that like I want to have the total use of my extremities.

Speaker 3:          00:36:15       Right? No gloves would be better for most grappler. Yeah, absolutely. You could slide things in better you. I said I don't want to get poked in the eye. So the pride gloves, that's how we make them better. Yeah. Why we own pride the UFC owns and just take the word slide off of it and then put those three letters on there. Bam. Yeah. They brought some new glove and they're like, here's the new glove, and I put it on. It was like, why? What the fuck is the difference? It's just slightly curved, like these bitches should be like really curved, like whereas if you want to do that, it said an effort and when you relax it goes right back to that. The effort is for 15 to 25 minutes. Like I'm sure my hand is strong enough to go like that when I need it to for 15 to 25 minutes.

Speaker 3:          00:36:56       Well I mean as long as you can do it when certain situations like, you know, you try and apply a choke or something, but it's very disheartening to me. All the people that are having detached retinas and Alan Belcher's was fucked up my. I mean bisping bisping Xyz off looked at him in the eye when we were like, well he's an oil in the oil and is high. Right? Yeah. Yeah. I don't know what he can see out of it or what it looks like. I mean, I guess it's diminished in some respect. Has to be. Yeah. It's so fucking weird and he's had a couple of surgeries, right? Bisping's had more than one ice surgery. It's fucking crazy, man. I don't want them there. I need them. Is it possible to do something where the fingers aren't exposed, like chop them off? No, no, no. I'm talking about like covering like what I was thinking of is like a, like a lamb skin sort of uncovering something is not thick, but like maybe like a band around the tips where you, you don't really do this ever anyway.

Speaker 3:          00:37:53       Know do you? When do you do that body lock takedown of stuff? You grabbed like this? No, no, no, but you do this. You still have this or this. I don't know. I mean, do you mostly do this? Let's design it. Okay, well I'm saying what I'm for folks who are listening, there's a thing called the gable grip and with the way a gable grip works is picture your hand. If you're going to karate chop someone in your fingers. Your thumb was pressed tightly against society or hand. Then have your hands like in across position where one, one sideways and one is a sitting straight up and then crushed down with your hands, with your, with your fingertips. That would be what a gable grip is like and that is the majority of wrestling of grabbing. When you you sent around the

Speaker 1:          00:38:36       waist, that's most of the way you grabbed the other way would be an escrip, which is you would make like an like 69, 69. That's it. Ian and Yang. If you're more uncouth or couth and you, you grabbed like that, but you never very rarely do you do this. Very rarely do you let your fingers intersect with each other. So it just doesn't. They don't have to be free like that. And when they're free, that's when fingers go and eyeballs. You know, I thought maybe like maybe there could be some sort of a flexible rounded covering which would eliminate. Seems like they've had to have tried it, you know? I don't think they have. Let's give it a whirl. It's, it's amazing to me how things just stay stagnant when they're retarded. Like when they don't, they don't make any sense like these gloves. So 12 to six elbow.

Speaker 1:          00:39:23       I love those. Why can't we do those? This should be at ease to the ground. Yeah. Well you telling me you can kick someone in the head with your Shin, but you can't drop an elbow down your head. Someone has never been kicked in the head with a shin. Obviously. That's the only reason why you would make that really think John Mccain for this one, wasn't it? That like that. That era was that era according to John Mccarthy who was there when it was all going on. John McCarthy, famous referee, the gold standard. That guy, great guy. Big John told me that they were having this meeting with the athletic commission and they had seen like karate brick breaking demonstrations on espn at like 2:00 in the morning and the board's shatter and everything. Well they said you can't do that move because that move could kill someone. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:40:09       If you can break bricks, you can obviously break somebody's neck. Exactly. And just blow. This is the real reason why the 12 to six elbow is illegal, but arguably this elbow is stronger. Definitely. It's got more, more torque to it. It's a more natural movement of the body. This is an awkward movement in comparison. Yeah, but I mean the Cobra Kai, Daniel's son watched those guys breaking boards. Yeah. It's tough to argue with that kind of logic. That is the logic that literally is complete pure ignorance. If you. If you asked like mixed martial arts, a competitor's trainers, fighters, people in the know and as them, which would be illegal, the 12 slash six elbow is not going to be on that list. No where near. It's a fine. It's a. it's a good technique. It's excellent as our knees on the ground. I think knees on the ground and it could be, you know, if, if someone wanted to have some sort of a compromise, maybe it would be knees on the ground when you're not pressed up against the cage. That could be a possibility. You know, the idea being that the niece of the head on the ground would be problematic against the cage because the guy couldn't move and that was one of the good things about pride was the ropes. If soccer kicks and all those things, you can kind of scoot your head under the ropes to get away from things you're not, you're not contained by your environment. And to the point where you would suffer a damaging blow that you could have avoided by your own power. I mean, outside of like

Speaker 3:          00:41:34       the north south 69 position for knees to the head on the ground. That's the only position I could think, you know, like obviously the limitation is you still can't strike to the top of the head or the back of the head with a knee and that under that premise then it doesn't really matter. Um, we need somebody from. Because you can't hurt them any worse than you could in any other way with any other strike from any other position. So yeah, and also I don't like this thing that guys are doing with a drop one hand down to avoid. But they had and they picked it up, drop it down like, oh, let's game. Play this down, down, down. Don't need me. Yeah, I'm up. Well, it's, it's very, very weird. It's just a, it's a weird gray area that I think needs to be sat down.

Speaker 3:          00:42:15       And then of course there's the scoring system which is adopted from boxing this 10 point scoring system, which is just terrible. And the implementation of it is even more terrible because very few 10, eight rounds get scored. Yeah. I mean I've rarely. There's 10, nine rounds that are squeakers, right? Like maybe one of your rounds with Jacques, right? Might've been at 10, nine round and then there's 10, nine rounds where a guy just gets fucking molly [inaudible] dropped to three times 10, nine round. Like how is that possible? It's a terrible system and I don't know if you ever saw doc Hamilton's scoring system. He had a half point scoring system, which is much more better. Way Better. I would want doc Hamilton's and to know what the scores are every road. I agree 100 percent. I agree. Every other fucking game, whether it's football, basketball, everything else.

Speaker 3:          00:43:06       I think it should be that way in boxing too. So it would discourage shitty judges from continuing their. Their shittiness Yup. And shitty fighters from continuing their shittiness. Yes. You know, the only real worry would be that guy would be so far ahead that he would run in the last round. He's up for rounds. John Jones move into fifth round against glover was like, alright, I have this, but a guy like John wouldn't do that anyway. Yeah. The great fighters would still fight the same and that not only that, the other guy is going to get more desperate so it'll make it even more exciting because he's going to have to. And if he doesn't like, well, will you not trying to win. Like you know, you're not going to win a decision, so either you just fucking throw caution to the wind and throw yourself in the line of fire or why you fighting.

Speaker 3:          00:43:49       Move on. Yeah. Move on. John Jones is a fucking phenomenon, man. That dude is good. As he has looked in the past, the fight against glover was just, just sensation was masterful. It was like, it was something to behold. I was like, he's amazing to the gym. He's, I mean, he's so talented in every respect, you know, like even I've been doing Jujitsu for forever and he's good. He's really, really good. And then like stand up as a whole different world. His wrestling is just out of this world, like, and then he goes on game day on fight day and he's better. He improvises today. It's beautiful. Yeah. When, when I asked him about the elbows in tight, like fighting glover against the cage

Speaker 1:          00:44:32       like that, I knew I just had a fucking feeling that he was improvising, that I was like, is this something you planned as like, no, I just felt it. He was winding up and I just felt like I could get away with that.

Speaker 2:          00:44:42       Uh, we're in fight camp are the exact same time I fought one week before him and uh, he did drill those, you know, like we're watching out for glover's big overhand. Right. You know, obviously we're looking for the two big, the two, three punch combos that he doesn't, entrances, you know, watching of course for her, for glover's wrestling, he's a beast on top. Um, and then you watched the fight and you're like, he didn't do that stuff in fight camp. He just fight night, started improvising and destroying the still number two dude on the planet. So decisive leader. It's disturbing. He also added in

Speaker 1:          00:45:16       new thing to his game that I think you're gonna. See a lot of people do. That's, that attacking the shoulder with that loose underhook. When a guy has that relax under hook and you yank that arm up, me, he fucked glover shoulder up in the first one

Speaker 2:          00:45:27       round. Never really recovered. Oh, it changed the whole feeling of what glover could do offensively from that point forward.

Speaker 1:          00:45:33       Yeah. He, he was mangled and now you know, his Labor was towards the surgery and surgery. Yeah. Yeah. John's done a lot of things that a lot of people implement now. The front leg side kick to the thigh and it was very few people doing that before him. Everybody does it. He's got to watch the finger pokes though, man. John has always doing that thing where it's extending his hands and you guys trying to move forward. They wind up running into his fingers all the time.

Speaker 2:          00:45:58       Yeah, I really do believe I hate finger pokes knee to the groin when guys get tired, cage grabbing like don't like it at all. So He's a teammate. Um, I really do believe that he doesn't intend to hit them in the eyes. He likes controlling range and he has an open hand out, you know, to try to set that range and to, and responsively counter attack and just like you said, guys just run into it, you know, he's not trying to poke him, but it's his fault because his hands open and his fingers are freaking pointing up there. Yeah. I don't think he's doing an intentionally either, but it is an issue. Has to change.

Speaker 1:          00:46:34       It happened with Gustafson and half, one glover, you know, it's um, it's a very, it's a very tricky situation because on one hand it's a good tactic. It's a good tactic to try to palm the forehead and you know, I mean, it's a big one in Moitai, but tie, of course you're dealing with a fully enclosed glove. I don't know what the fuck they can do, what they really need to do something and it needs to be a priority. Gloves, Prague, gloves. There it is, man, when you watch pride. And I've been watching a lot of pride lately because I, um, at home, uh, I, uh, yeah, it's fucking awesome. Greatest Shit ever. You know, it's really interesting to watch the evolution of the sport too. When you watch pride, you watched like guys and you compare them to the best guys of today and like, wow, this is like a, there's been a big fucking jumped,

Speaker 2:          00:47:17       big fucking jump. I love Don Frye and his mustache. Rest in peace, mustache. But you look, that's crazy. But like Don fry in pride compared to the light heavyweights, now I'm just the disparity of, of skill and technical level. Even athleticism and don was a beast. Um, it's night and day.

Speaker 1:          00:47:39       Well, I was watching vandelay the best of vandelay in pride. There was an episode in the best of pride where it was all vandalized fights and you know, vandelays one of my favorite fighters to watch. It's a wild man, but you know, you compare his skill level to like a guy like Jon Jones who they're fighting at the same weight class. Like that wouldn't even be a hard fight for like a round. Yeah. It would not be a, it would be you can't touch me and I'm going to keep hitting you and you're going to not know what to do and then either you're going to get choked, unconscious or, or beat the fuck up. Yeah. It's amazing how much of a jump. There's bins from 93 to 2014 as far as the evolution of martial arts. And I say it like it's a line that I keep saying, but it's true in those two decades, martial arts have evolved more than they have in the last 2000 years. It's incredible. Absolutely. To longest time, man. You know, I grew up doing martial arts in the eighties and nobody knew what the fuck worked. It was all just guessing. You know, everybody knew that, you know, if you were a really good wrestler, you could take guys down and if you are really good box so you could probably punch better, but what would work better? Karate or judo, what will work better? Jiu Jitsu it nobody knew. Nobody fucking knew. It was a guessing game.

Speaker 2:          00:48:51       Naming new moves. Every single card. You're like, oh, what are you gonna? Call this one. Like how can we progress so quickly where every Saturday night we're like, oh, here's a new submission. You know? It's just unbelievable.

Speaker 1:          00:49:01       Yeah. The Peruvian Necktie, Tony D'souza, which you very rarely see. I mean CB dollar is probably the only I think. I don't even know if the Sousas ever pulled it off inside the octagon, but cb Dahl always pulled it off, is a few guys that use that Peruvian neck time and then there's a. there's, there's a few jokes that you, you know, you see them once and then you never see them again. It's, it's a fascinating thing where you're watching all this stuff evolve. Right? Right. In front of your eyes. How do you manage your training when it comes to like working on new techniques, adding new things to your arsenal and instill just the conditioning, the sparring, the day to day drilling that you have to do. Like how do you manage stuffing, all that stuff in

Speaker 2:          00:49:45       time management. Like a good athlete, you know, I do things like ratios, percentages of k I want to develop or give a certain percentage of time to getting better. So I'm going to, let's say I have 10 classes a week. I'm just real easy round number in that in those 10 classes, you know like I want two or three of them to be exclusively focused on drilling new techniques, you know, that I want two or three of them to be maintenance of things that I do well and want to continue to do well. And there's just, just grappling like in, in a, in a, in a one week, 10 class setting and then you know, two or three of them are, are hard grappling, sparring type sessions, you know. Then the other ones like maybe a float or of I'm teaching or I'm working with just a handful of black belts trying to create new stuff, you know, so like it's equally proportionate to stain. Good. Challenging myself physically and developing new technique and learning. You know.

Speaker 3:          00:50:47       What about recovery? Like what about um, what, what do you do stuff for the birds? What do you do for fun? Do you have like a routine as far as like deep tissue massage, Cryo therapy? What do you do? Yes. To both of those. So Austin, cryotherapy. I'm there because I'm one of those things. You stand in one of those chambers and it's 50 below zero. Negative 300 is that happens your Dick. When you do that, that seems to me it'd be gloved fingers. Right?

Speaker 2:          00:51:15       And I take those gloved fingers and I cover what is going to be my very small penis in like seconds, you know, and I make sure I like double handed. So both my hands are like,

Speaker 3:          00:51:25       yeah. Does anybody go raw dog and just let their Dick Freeze? That would be a. because if you found out that guy did it, you'd probably have to do it too. Wouldn't you know, I would assume that you would be one of those guys. I'd be like, all right, I am that. I'm like, I'm so stupid. I'm going to do. Really? Are you messing with me? I'm going to do it. Yeah, just do it. A monk position.

Speaker 2:          00:51:49       Three minutes, right? Um, and then you get out huge infusion of blood. You feel better.

Speaker 3:          00:51:54       What's the pro? Eddie Bravo did this, uh, in preparation for his heuler match, which is the first time I'd heard about it. Like explain it to me and for the lay people at home, it's your neck is above your head of exposed. Yeah. So the closes on you suntanning

Speaker 2:          00:52:09       bed. Exactly. But you're, you're standing up, right? They punched, punched liquid nitrogen gas in there. So up I about your chin down to like negative 300 degrees. So you're breathing, the gas is coming up to your Chin and um, you know, the largest organ in your body is your skin. So it's very responsive. It can absorb quickly and people take drugs that way. Uh, you know, you can also, it's very responsive, so it gets exposed to negative 300 degrees. The first thing it does is take blood from the extremities and rushes it to the vital life sustaining organs of your body, your brain, your heart, and your lungs. So all the blood goes from your extremities to your core and then you get in. You're there for like two, three minutes and super crazy because if you have an injury like a hurt knee or a hurt hand where you have extra fluid there, it gets super cold there because you have more fluid there and more fluid is conductive and it gets colder faster.

Speaker 2:          00:53:04       So you can feel these injuries on your body. Get crazy cold and then you hop out. Three minutes is up, you get out of the get out of the chamber and then your body responds to being an 80 degrees and all the Rut, all the blood rushes back out to the extremities. So you get this huge infusion of good healthy blood back out to these injuries and out to your extremities. It's a rush. Feels like you just drank five cups of coffee and you're like Hampton, uh, it's just this weird tingley fantastic, um, sensation. So that's what happens. And how does it help you recover by doing the infusion circulation like the, in the trying to treat an injury, you know, you have, you have rest, ice, compression, elevation, you know, when, when you're trying to work on recovery without injury, you want circulation so you want good healthy blood going to muscles that you've just fatigued to increase recovery and response time.

Speaker 2:          00:53:59       So if you just like simple terms, if I went and did like a big squat and deadlift workout for the day, right? My legs and back and are going to be sore, you know those extremities, law, it's vascular region. So go hop in the cryo chamber. All the blood that's sitting there in that area, in my legs, my back and my butt. I'm all rushed to my brain and lungs and heart. Then I get out and all sorts of great new, fantastic blood goes back to my legs, back and. But so I get a great, huge infusion of good healthy blood back out to my extremities to increase recovery time because I'm just increasing circulation. Increasing circulation is increasing recovery.

Speaker 3:          00:54:40       Wow. That's fascinating shit man. It's, it's fascinating when you see all these new innovations when it comes to strength and conditioning and recovery and fitness. And that's a, that's a unique one, man. That's, that's interesting stuff. It's cold though. Yeah. How many days a week do you do that for? And they have a place like that in Albuquerque.

Speaker 2:          00:55:00       No, they don't. They have a trailer that sometimes they'll, they'll bring out to me and in fight camps. That

Speaker 3:          00:55:07       is, that has that in it. Yeah. Oh, that's nice. That's super nice. Wow. So Albuquerque doesn't have that open. Greg Jackson get on the ball, but come on. Should have that task.

Speaker 2:          00:55:17       Yeah, deep tissues. Great. Um, you know, I, I believe like the tenants, the foundations of Bni, healthy recovering athlete, you know, like good sleep, good food, good sex, you know, like you have to have those. And if you're doing those things, then your body's gonna adapt to whatever the workload of volume that you're putting out. So I have a crazy volume like guys that come and train with me. They're like, this is normal, this is normal, this is what I do normally buy. Just have a very healthy foundation of a lifestyle, you know, like we're, I don't really drink, I don't ever smoke, you know, like I train every single day to three times a day. Like this is my body's adaptive to that. And then everything else, the supporting structure of eating well, you know, having an awesome supplements. Um, you know, having everything just to make my body respond properly to training volume is, is there.

Speaker 3:          00:56:08       So how do you work your diet out? What do you, uh, do you do have a nutritionist that you work with, you do it on your own,

Speaker 2:          00:56:15       of all of the above, you know, like, um, I have nutritionists that I bounce stuff off of and like people that are way smarter than me that, um, and then I'm surrounded with so many other elite athletes talking to them and their coaches, you know, the guys on it, you know, they have a whole, they have a stable of guys there that are always looking for the next best thing or even not the next best thing. Things there just have been there around for thousands of years that nobody uses like they should. So it's, it's a constant discussion of like how to improve. I know what my calories that I'm burning a day because I log everything. Um, you know, I fought two weeks ago, so I was on crazy strict diet for like three, four months to get down to one 85. Now I'm back in Austin, Texas. Maybe I'll have a little bit of brisket. It's getting in there. You has some tacos. So what, which I think is actually needed. You know, you should, you, you can't be perfect all the time. Your body needs those cheats.

Speaker 3:          00:57:08       Yeah, I agree. I think cheat days are important. I think people that are just completely clean and strict, you're robbing yourself also of enjoyment. Yeah. Life's too short and yeah, there's some delicious food that you shouldn't eat all the time, but you should eat sometimes. Definitely. Right? Yeah. Um, so do you, when you say that you logged the amount of calories that you burn, how do you calculate that?

Speaker 2:          00:57:30       So heart rate monitor right during the workout knows my resting metabolic rate is key. You have to know what that is and once you know what that is kind of in between workouts, you know, cumulatively in a day what you've burnt and then you just add during the workouts. You know, if I work out two or three times that day, you know, if I'm doing a 90 minute strength and conditioning session, you know I'm going to burn anywhere between 12 to 1600 calories in that session. You know, from warm, warm up to cool down. And then like last night I had a two hour Jujitsu Shush session, you know, like, and it smashed afterwards, you know, like I know what my, kind of, what my heart rate was at during the entire time and two hours, you know, that's going to be another 1500 calories that I'm putting on top of what I brought in that day. So I guess snapshot that I bought, you know, 5,500 to 6,000 calories.

Speaker 3:          00:58:20       That's insane. Yeah. That's way more than most people eat the day. Yeah. It's fun to eat that though. How do you stuff that in though? I'm in the way. What do you. The Texas brisket. So easy. Do you have any other nutritional requirements? Like do you eat gluten? Do you, do you take sugar into your diet at all?

Speaker 2:          00:58:42       I try. I try not to. I'm definitely fight camp. I don't have either of those, you know, but like right now, um, you know, I had an apple fritter Bagel on Monday. Like I hadn't had one of those and

Speaker 3:          00:58:53       I didn't even know how long and it was amazing. Is like a small orgasm in my mouth. I don't even know what that is. And the Apple Fritter Bagel? No, not Bagel. Just an apple fritter. Oh, her donut. Oh, okay. So it's like just donut with apple, gluten and sugar and apples. Sugar and that sort of a. What is that syrupy stuff in with the apples and cinnamon has exactly what? That sounds good. It was good it yet. Do Krispy Kreme it? Do you ever Krispy Kreme it? No. You don't go to Krispy Kreme? No. Damn dude know there's a spot that I go to a I, I'm again, Regena keen. Do you know what that is? And something that they go to Germany for that. Uh, Dr Peter Weller invented. It's a blood spinning. Oh yeah. You guys are doing it too. Yeah, I've been getting it done. I had it done on my neck.

Speaker 3:          00:59:39       I had a bulging disc in my neck that was impinging on nerves. I was getting some numbness in my hand from Jujitsu. Went away and totally the magic. The thing just shrunk down to nothing. But the place where I get it, it's right down the street from Krispy Kreme. I drive, I'm like, do I want to fuck up what I just fixed, just do it inflammation. And um, apparently inflammation. And uh, I found out about it from a physical therapist that gluten and inflammation, the, they're like, people say, Oh, you know, you're not really gluten sensitive. Most people aren't mean you can eat gluten, he be fine. But the reality is it does cause some inflammation more. Eat the morning you get. Yeah. That's a fascinating thing that it's a normal part of everybody's diet. You wouldn't think that it would have that sort of an effect on your joints or your back or.

Speaker 3:          01:00:21       But it really does. Yeah. Well, especially if they train, like we do like that, then now we're just compounding problems where we have the enablers to cause inflammation and then we're diet. Giving something that helps cause it, you know, now things are just compounded and it's exponential. And then we actually like, ah, what about dairy? Not much at all. Some cheeses I just can't live without your cheeses. Your cheese guy mean. Yes, I'm a food guy. If it's good, I want it. Yeah, you cook, right? Oh God, I love to cook. What kind of, what do, what do you cook? Um, I love everything, but I love cooking like real. When I say real, um, it's my food that I shot. It's that I cleaned that. I froze that I packaged, that I brought in from my greenhouse in my backyard, you know, like my food.

Speaker 3:          01:01:11       Right, right, right. So I, I'm with you a thousand percent. I love being connected to what I put in my body. Yeah. There's very few people who have experienced that haven't said that it's something special when you cook an animal that you actually hunted, shot, butchered, cut up, put in your freezer or eating in camp, which is even better when you're eating it like a couple of hours after it died. This is an amazing connection that, you know, people will poopoo that, like it's not important. Like, you know, Oh, you're just using that as an excuse to go out and shoot animals. Like, no, and I really wish those folks. I would really like to take someone who is his immediate or who's anting hunting and just you need to just experience this. Just experienced 100 percent agree. I wish every person that ate meat, um, and ironically a ton of anti hunters like eat meat obviously. Um, there's no connection to food these days. People just want to go to the grocery store and pick their stuff off the shelf and have no idea how it got there, what was put in there. But then they judge me because I hunt. But I know exactly where this animal came from, you know, and like I felt sorry for it when I shot it, they thought it was beautiful

Speaker 2:          01:02:20       and I still do and I'm enjoying every single bite of it, but they. But they're going to sit there and be like, aw man, that guy hunts, you know, like I'm a, I'm an absolute fanatic conservationist, but I want. Yeah. And I love my food and I love good food. So they're all connected and I think people should wake up.

Speaker 1:          01:02:36       It's also what we were taught kind of talking about earlier is that there's a. there's a broad spectrum of things that are going on in this world. There is no black and white when it comes to hunting. You can actually love animals and still shoot them and kill the level in that, but it's a crazy thing like people have. They find that like impossibly contradictory, but it's not and it's also the other thing that people don't want to admit is that if you do not shoot these animals, they are going to continue to fuck. They're going to continue to procreate and then how are you going to control the population because you have two options. Either you can hunt them or you can bring in wolves. So what do you want to do? You want wolves wandering around through your fucking neighborhood, killing everything that they can get ahold of, including dogs, including livestock. Do you want wild panthers? What do you want? What do you. How are you going to control the populations of these animals that don't have natural predators?

Speaker 2:          01:03:27       The first, my experience, I was like a prepubescent kid when Catalina island off the coast of California, I'm somebody accidentally introduced a hog to Catalina and it made it in boned with maybe one or two other wild hogs that were there that created this feral big ass hog that made a whole bunch of shit, tons of more hogs and then started destroying the entire island. So they brought in hunters to x, like get rid of these hogs that we're destroying the, the, the entire ecosystem of the island. Um, and that happens on a much more. That's the micro example on a tiny little island with a tiny little animal. But if you look at the big picture of, you know, like deer in the south or hogs from Florida to Texas, you know, or the python that was introduced to the everglades, they have to be hunted to maintain the balance of harmony in the ecosystem. And the ecosystem will crash if it's not done. Uh, so you either, like you said, give a Predator and the Predator has serious problems that come along with it. Or You have the hunter that does it properly and uh, and then you have the benefits that come along with it, which is a proper ecosystem

Speaker 1:          01:04:48       and you get delicious wild Ham. Look at that. Yeah. I smoked that bitch myself. Okay. That my backyard, I shot it and I smoked it and it was the best tasting ham ever. Wild pig has a completely different texture than anything. It's, it's like a, we, I marinated it or brined it rather for seven days before I smoked it. But even so it's like, it's a more dense meet. It's more muscle, it's darker, it tastes better. It's better for you and

Speaker 3:          01:05:18       you fucking have to kill them because there's 50,000 hogs. The place where I go to is to hone ranch. We only an hour and a half outside of La and they have elk. They have a pond up there that they put a trail camera on just to see what's eating there. 16 different mountain minds. Oh, nothing. Just 16 different fucking wild murderous cats. And it's because there's so many pigs, there's so much. There's so much game up there you could in in from Texas to Florida, you could bring in every hunter in the nation and have them kill 10 pigs a piece and it wouldn't even dent. What's the population of wild hogs in the southeast? Have you ever seen a pork lips now? No. It sounds like the best movie ever. It's a show. There's this. There's a dude. His name is Brian, I think is his name, his name?

Speaker 3:          01:06:11       He's the guy from Texas and he's got a show called pig man and a pig man is. He's a hunter in Texas and he hunts wild pigs and then he owns a barbecue place and then serves up wild pig bbq. Now he's got a show on one of those like history or something like that. It's called boss Hog and it shows sort of details with doing. I'm familiar with it. Him and Ted nugent got helicopters with fucking machine guns and they're flying around with ars, shooting pigs out of the sky. I mean, it is the craziest fucking thing I've ever seen on TV. That's legal now. Yeah, we pass through it. Yeah. You have to and, but for folks that don't, that's cruel, that's horrible. There are millions of pigs, they don't care. And they know not only that, they don't stop fucking, they breed all year round.

Speaker 3:          01:07:03       It's not like deer that have a Rut and then they'll have a fond. Now these are animals that are shitting out four or five pigs every four or five months and they just don't, don't, don't, don't, don't. And this is a, this is the video of them shooting these things from the sky. There's actually companies, this is the wrong one. You see what you're showing is there's a pig hunting video that was a pig hunting promo for the sportsmans channel, but this is, uh, they, they had a whole episode and in the episode that killed 450 pigs in a fucking 22 minute episodes with commercials. But that's like a drop in the ocean to what's there. Yeah. Literally it is like taking a shot glass and tossing the end to the ocean. I mean, it's the most ridiculous thing you've ever seen in your life and they're just catching these pigs running head shots where they're tomblin while they're running and there's something barbaric and fucked up about it, but they're taking that food and they're feeding hungry people. They have hunters for the hungry, they give the wild pork, which is excellent meat. They give it to a hungry families and it's really, really, really delicious food and it's important to. But then there's that thing where people are like, well, that's fucked up, man. That's not really hunting. They're shooting. It's all, they're not really hunting.

Speaker 1:          01:08:16       They're eradicating these problematic delicious animals. That's the best way to look at it.

Speaker 2:          01:08:22       They have to be eradicated. And while it might not be the most humane approach to it, um, it's an, it's a necessary one that has to happen. And so, I dunno, like it's a necessary evil a little bit.

Speaker 1:          01:08:32       Well, you know, what's going on in the Hamptons, the Hamptons, the luxury area outside of long island where all these, what's going on with rich folks, they have so many deer up there that they're bringing in snipers. The snipers in the middle of the night and the town is proposed to give these deer birth control to somehow or another give them food, put food out that has birth control in it, which by the way, the male deer are going to eat too, so you can make bitches out of the male deer. The mail you're going to run around. I think I'm fucking pregnant. Why am I not true? Yeah, so you get to have these male deer. They're eating birth control, female deer, and it's going to cost hundreds of thousands of dollars and it's a direct result of the failure to eradicate. These animals are controller population through hunting.

Speaker 1:          01:09:15       There's a place in Pennsylvania where they have 24, a 24 hour day, seven day a week hunting, 365 days a year. You can hunt with bows and arrows. You can hunt all year around because there are so many deer. They're like just fucking bring in hunters and the hunters come in and there's these huge estates that have these 10 acre properties where there's a fucking tree stands and there's million dollar houses with fucking putting green courses and dudes and trees. Dan's launching arrows at deer because they're fucking everywhere. They're like tree score, like ground squirrels. You ever driving a like a ranch that has ground squirrels and as the car is running you see like others run across the road. It's incredible. Like to hone ranch which has 50,000 hogs. It has rocky mountain elk, gigantic elk. They have thousands of deer. They have bears, they have mountains, they have everything. The number one animal mass, pound for pound is ground squirrels, and there's 2,700,000 acre ranch. Number one is ground squirrels,

Speaker 2:          01:10:16       I believe it was my dad in. Here's a narcotics officer for 30 years door kicking superstar. He spends his retired time now shooting ground squirrels like the most amazing setup. Ground squirrels, ground squirrels, ground squirrels, no it on the ranch. Like the. The cows will step in their whole break their legs or they destroy irrigation for the vineyards, like they're nasty. They're disease carrying and they also breed like crazy. You can't stop them. They're cannibals too. Like you shoot one to like drag it into the hole and eat it.

Speaker 1:          01:10:53       Very different from tree squirrels. Tree squirrels are actually good. I've eaten tree squirrel. They're delicious. They're pretty. They're tastes good man. Steve Rinella. The guy who was the host, immediate or shadow squirrel when we were in Wisconsin and cooked it and it was real. It's a very unique taste to it doesn't taste like anything else. But um,

Speaker 2:          01:11:11       ground squirrels, man. I eat one. Yeah,

Speaker 3:          01:11:14       we currently can't. Apparently. They're just fucking disgusting. Yeah. It's like, I mean, I guess you could eat it if you were starving to death, but the other problem is if you shoot them, you have to kill them because if you shoot them and you wound them, they run into their hole and then the other ones eat it. Yeah. Fucking creepy little nasty. A lot. A lot of creepy little animals out there. But this, I mean the idea that there's one branch with $2 million, 700,000 acres there, largest largest animal mass is ground squirrels. Well, they say that the largest mass of, of life on earth moving life is aunts and that there's more pounds of ants a than there are humans, pounds of humans. It's incredible. Yeah. And they're like 10,000 times stronger than we are ratio. Yeah. They never get mad at us. Or are they better not start growing.

Speaker 3:          01:12:06       You know, if you go back throughout the history and you find some of the animals that were just really enormous just to a few hundred million years ago and if somehow or another shrunk down to a manageable size. Yeah. Like if bees, if bees of the size of horses, we'd have real problems. I love honey. Yeah. Honey is delicious. You know, vegans don't eat honey. That's a horrible. That's hilarious. That's hilarious. Just show if you ever want to know how retarded it being a Vegan is, you won't eat honey. Uh, either retarded. The moment that they start with I'm a Vegan, you know. Well they can't help say it. It's like they're holding hands. They run marathons. Yeah. Just like another thing that comes out right away is like, I'm a marathoner, or I'm a Vegan, or I eat Paleo, or I'm a crossfit. That's like nobody can help but tell you those necessary elements of themselves.

Speaker 3:          01:12:55       Yeah. What is that? I don't know what it is. It's they want to tell you they're awesome, but to me that almost discounts discounts you as being such. Yeah. If you're a Vegan, you cannot tell people for a long period of time. That's super impressive. I'll like you more. Wow. You're a Vegan and you just. It took you two weeks to tell me, I'm impressed. Can I buy you lunch of Vegan lunch? I get it. For people that don't want to be cruel, I totally get the whole sentiment I get. I get all of it. I get the idea of like wanting to eat fresh vegetables and it's healthy for you. I get it, but the finite nature of life itself, it's just. It seems to me it's so silly that you think that somehow under the EU not killing animals is somehow going to balance things out or you not being a part of killing animals is going to bow.

Speaker 3:          01:13:42       They're killing each other. Do you know that? Like there's a war going on. All the animals are involved in it, including humans. We're just so far ahead. We forgot it's a war and we have POW camps, so we set up in cities, we call them zoos and that's it. That is that they didn't ask to be there. We capture those motherfuckers and we put them and they're in these weird things where we don't let them interact with the other animals in the zoo. We, we blocked them off in their own little apartments and you know, so we could stare at him all we popcorn. I'm not sure I agree with that. I don't. I think that if you should have zoos, you should lump all those bitches together and if you run out of monkeys, go get more. The monkeys, the monkeys that survive are going to be the ones that know how to get away from the cat.

Speaker 3:          01:14:26       He's a bad ass. That monkey. I want us to pet. Yeah, that's a monkey. Knows that to zig and zag. He knows that a Juke, you know when the cat's coming, he knows that to gets to the type. The tall branches, the monkey that stays in the ground and picks his ass while the Jaguars slowly creeping up on him. That's the monkey that's supposed to die. The only weird part about the shoe worlds and the zoos have this of, of our life is that they do. I love when people are like, oh, did you see the movie black fish? You know, like, it's so horrible. I'm going to boycott seaworld. You're like, have you ever given a cent to marine biology or the preservation of marine wildlife? No, but you're going to boycott seaworld. How much money have they given in the research and preservation of marine wildlife?

Speaker 3:          01:15:10       Oh yeah. A thousand times more than you. It's the same with the zoos. You know, like, I don't like zoos. I think it's horrible that the animals were there, but they do more in research and understanding wildlife and the preservation of wildlife. Then almost everyone that goes there and then or doesn't go there and complained about it, so it's just like this. Again, shades of gray. My problem with seaworld is very simple. Those animals are smart. They're very smart. In fact, the cerebral cortex of a dolphin's 40 percent larger than that of a human being so beautiful. We don't even understand how smart they are because they can't alter their environment, so we don't think of them as being smart because they can. They don't have funds. They don't pick things up because they can move in three d all around the ocean. They can fucking dive and swim and move around and they have these pods.

Speaker 3:          01:15:53       They stay together, they have families, they have dialects, they have languages. There are so intelligent that we, we, we're just now starting to understand that they have variations in the way they speak depending upon what geographic location they're at. They're really fucking smart human type smart and just because they're different from us and they don't build houses doesn't mean they're not smart. So to me it's like slavery. It's like just because you know, we have donated so much money into slavery research, but you're still fucking slave owners. Yukon's, you know, the reason why there needs to be slavery research. I just think that anything smart shouldn't be in captivity, but like giraffes, they're so stupid. You go to the zoo and they seem happy as fuck there is happy there and they let babies feed them. I have a three year old, then she holds up lettuce.

Speaker 3:          01:16:40       The draft comes and take it. That fucking drafts. Not upset at all. They're so confident that giraffes are chill, that they let babies freedom, you know, are there. They are so chill. They're just happy. There's no lions for you to be a giraffe all day. You have a giant target. Your neck is just a huge target or beacon. Somebody wants to bite. There's not one spot. It's not like a wart hog that is just a little short fucking stubby neck. It's tough to get to you. There's a giant neck trees everywhere rounded you could and kill

Speaker 1:          01:17:10       you. I mean, they're so happy. They're in the zoo. They're so happy. No, they don't know how happy they are. They're like, wait, nothing's eating meat and this three year olds giving me food. Okay, I think this is good. But then there's, there's weirdness when it comes to captivated captive animals, like, um, these hunting camps that they have in Africa, it gets again the gray area, the weirdness of the world because, you know, Louis thorough the documentary guy. Yeah. Fascinating guy had him on the podcast. Really, really interesting category to watch. That one is a good one. One of the best documentaries that he did was when he went to Africa and went to these hunting camps, they have these high fence hunting camps where they take these animals and they put them in these huge enclosures and they let people hunt them. The irony is these animals are, there's higher populations.

Speaker 1:          01:17:59       They're healthier. There's more of them. Animals that were on the verge of extinction are now. There's many, many, many of them, but they're hunted. Yeah, so it's like people have this weird sort of like, well yeah, the animals are healthier, that populations are healthier, but the reason being is because people can pay to go kill them. Like whoa, but it's just another example of the world not being so clear cut. There's a lot of weirdness out there. Ironically, the like some of the rhinos that are left in this world are at those camps. They're not being hunted. There've been protected during these high fence game fence areas where people are coming. They'll come look at the rhino and be like, Oh wow, what a beautiful. Righto, righto. All right, let's go shoot a buck and a kudu. How much does it cost? You know, like something they couldn't do 20 years ago because there weren't enough of them, but no, like, oh limitless and Paula, what?

Speaker 1:          01:18:49       That's a blessed book. Oh, I'll take one of those. That's not a problem. You know, like that's what it's like there. But there they saved species by making them available to be paid for. Yeah, it was very strange. And Louis Theroux is documentary really kept his position. Well, his position is he's trying to get to it. He's trying to get to his position during the whole documentary. He's like, okay, I see, but the real position is really clearly established by the guy who runs the hunting camp because he gets angry at Louis. One point in the show, like, you know, three quarters of the way in. He goes, you don't understand. He goes, Africa is fucked. He goes, it's fucked. Unless something is with money, it's gonna fucking die. They fucking kill everything. It's fucked. There's nothing here that have these fucking animals. I here is because they're worth money. That's it. That's it. Do you understand? And you know Louise, like I guess I understand it's true. It is true, it is true, and in a sense that sort of mirrors what's going on when it comes to wildlife in America. More money has been spent by hunters to conserve wetlands, to preserve wildlife habitat, for elk, to preserve areas where deer live and, and, and to

Speaker 3:          01:20:08       establish clear protocols as far as how many animals can, can be sustained in any given location and keep the populations healthy. All that money comes from hunters, which is just amazing. It's just, it's another one of those things. It's like when you look at it in a clear objective terms, you see that this is a very complex issue and it's not as simple as these animals are beautiful. We should not kill them. Like they're beautiful. Yeah. You have to kill them though, but you have to kill him. Whoa, right. Sucks. It's not really the delicious. That's the crazy thing is. No, no, it doesn't really suck. They are delicious. Like, fuck man, there's so much going on there. And again, that's just the way the world is the world, which is like this ironic contrast to the first 10 years of my life where like, I didn't think what I was shooting was beautiful because they're evil fuckers, you know, like now as a sportsman, a hunter, like I love these animals.

Speaker 3:          01:21:06       Which animals do you think we're evil? Uh, terrorists. But when we are, you said for the first 10 years of your life, you're shooting terrorist. Ten years of my career as a shooter. Oh, I thought you were saying as your life when you're nine years old at 23, you know, it's like no remorse. Slept very well at night because these were evil people and now I'm like, Oh man, I don't want to shoot that. That's pretty. Now that thing's beautiful. That all. Shoot, you know, because that is really yummy and there's too many of them know. Yeah. I have a buddy who served and came back and he loves fishing and he had a real hard time getting back into hunting. He said, you know, you just, you see so much death at a certain point in time, you don't want to be a part of empathize. Yeah. Yeah. He, he got back. He lives in New Mexico and he got back into elk hunting. New Mexican was great for elk. He got back into an after awhile, but it took them awhile, took them awhile to just sort of settle in. He just like, I saw too much death.

Speaker 3:          01:22:05       Totally empathetic to that. Is there ever going to be a time when there's no war? Is that even possible with human beings? Not In my lifetime. That's a disturbing idea for people because if people have this idea, I mean this is, this is a shitty analogy, but it's one that I use if 20 people can get along, if like, okay, there's five of us in this room were four of us in this room. If there's four people in this room and we can get along, can 40 people get along? Yes. 40 people can get along. You could have a community of 40 people with no problems and just live from birth to death and everybody, you know, nobody kills anybody that weird outlier at 40, but you know, as a community that they'll absorb him for what he is or whatever, but then you get to 4,000. No, no, someone's going to die. Yeah, Jim's Douche. We've got to take out Jim, you know, and everybody's gonna meet by the Campfire and go, look, this motherfucker is just ruining our life. He doesn't hunt. He eats all her food. He fucks are women were not there. He beats our kids. We've got to kill this

Speaker 1:          01:23:06       guy and there's one out of a certain number. There's going to be this one that comes up and then when you deal with $7 million, it's like, Whoa, how does, how does, how does that ever become manageable? I mean to human beings have to evolve past what we are right now. Do we have to hope some new stage? Yeah, I hope so too. Well, you would know better than anybody what the horrors of war are. So would you think that someone who has experienced that would have a better perspective about what's necessary and what's not necessary when it comes to sort of just managing piece? Try to.

Speaker 2:          01:23:50       Yes and no. You know, there's no like, nirvana moment where you had like this clear sight of, you know, what an understanding of what's necessary and what's not, how people should be or how people shouldn't be. Like if anything, you know, as six years as a door kicker assaulter and then four years as a halo sniper guy. I've seen death like from a foot away and from a mile away, you know, so like there's no range of death I haven't seen. So if anything, like I value life more. I think, um, I hate war more like I know, like I think it's horrible and disgusting, but without a doubt I think it's absolutely necessary and,

Speaker 4:          01:24:32       and

Speaker 2:          01:24:33       needed into such a level that I can't even imagine what this world would be like had we not been involved to the degree that we've been involved in for the past 12 years trying to eradicate this fanatic group of psychopaths. So I don't want to think about what the world would be like, but, you know, I don't want my, my nieces and my nephews or my kids to ever have to do what I did or see what I saw. So I dunno, like, um, I hope we never have to invade a country. You know, I remember we were talking about Syria. You're like, are we going to go over there? I was like, God, no. You know, there's no, there's no need. There's no resources. There's no necessary element for us to be involved in. But the preservation of human life isn't that needed. You know, Brian, I don't. Well, that's one of the reasons why

Speaker 1:          01:25:24       false flags and false flag operations are so disgusting when you find out that someone's lying about the motivation for profit and that

Speaker 2:          01:25:33       nothing worse than somebody that lies for the benefit of themselves. Like Joe, I think you're a good looking man and I think that dress looks great on you and it makes you look thin. That's no k lice lie sometimes to to tell you no, wait, it's your 28th birthday, you know, that's great to hear. You know, I'm 40 or whatever. You know, like those, those are not self serving lizard cute laws, but when you're lying so that you can put money in your pocket at the expense of human, I hope you burn in hell forever.

Speaker 1:          01:26:04       It's a dark law. No, it's a very, very dark lie. It's, it's a. it's a confusing lie too because it's like, wait a minute, wait a minute. This has actually happened. When you find out about the Gulf of Tonkin or operation northwoods, that there have been these moments in time where people have tried to figure out a way to lie in order to drag people into war, a war that otherwise the public wouldn't support. It's a. it's dark, it's dark. It's. It's a very weird aspect of society that it not only that exists, but that's ignored. It's ignored and almost brushed under the table when you start talking about war and about policy. This is something that people don't want to acknowledge, that we have been duped by the military industrial complex in the past and that it is actually many standard, standard operational procedure that they will come up with different ways in order to get people to support Warren. One of them is the lie. You know when, when guys come back, the big one is ptsd. That's, that's the the the hardest aspect. It seems to to integrate back into a normal society with normal life and normal jobs and normal. Just the things that we all just deal with on a regular basis. For some folks it becomes almost unbearable. What is the difference between people that integrate smoothly and people that have an incredibly difficult time,

Speaker 2:          01:27:31       you know, from, from that incredibly difficult time to smoothly are all scales, you know, and the biggest or the factors are the degrees of coping mechanisms that, that an individual has. I have a very strong family, you know, like an amazing wife. Fantastic father and mother. They're still married. Amazing brother and sister. Great. Like so family unit. Very supportive. I'm very fit and very healthy. I'm well educated as well trained. These are all different mechanisms to deal with stress. Everybody deals with stress differently, but the foundation of how you deal with stress, you have to have these fundamental elements to be able to do the more of them that you have, the more stress you can deal with. So a guy like me that was ranger sniper, green baret like killed. Lots of dudes can come back and sleep well at night, you know? Yeah.

Speaker 2:          01:28:20       I had to adjust. There are things that, you know, like I had moments where a guy smoking a clove that may be just aided Indian restaurant. So I'm having some sensory to like how he smells, listening to music from that culture that I just spent six, six months with, you know, like I'm like, I want to shoot this person, like that instant reaction. But then I'm like, okay, know everything's okay. I'm wow. What is that like? It's weird. I was walking into a best buy and that was an example. This guy driving a yellow bmw, you're smoking a clove and I got this width of like curry and so everything was there. Like the music, the look what he was wearing, you know? Um, yeah, like I was just like, fuck, it looks like a terrorist, a snap judgment. Like I just got back a couple of days, letter later and I was like, should I shoot this person? No, I'm in Fayetteville, North Carolina. Walk into a best buy to buy the new avengers movie. Now there was iron man. I remember what it was. But you were an educated

Speaker 1:          01:29:15       guy and you're intelligent in respect of introspective guy for a guy who's not.

Speaker 2:          01:29:21       That's the problem with those coping mechanisms. Like how much does that person have? You have a national guardsman that enlisted out of high school, him comes from a broken home. He's poor, you know, then he goes, he, he, he, he enlisted to be a truck driver and then his truck gets blown up and they get in a firefight and then he sees death. He saw the guy that has navigator, just lost an arm. Did that guy is scarred for life. You know, he has no kept coping mechanisms deal. And then he comes home and he's broken and he's damaged, you know, like, how, how does that person reintegrate into society without all the necessary coping mechanisms? Man, it's hard. Um, when you hear it

Speaker 1:          01:29:58       about stories where guys snap and uh, there, there've been several over the course of these two wars and one of the big ones was uh, a decorated guy want killing a bunch of civilians and it made, made a lot of the rounds on these talk shows or people trying to discuss like ptsd and traumatic events and that this guy was, he was having real problems and reporting, having real problems before all this happened. And they kept sending him back over there. Do you, do you relate to that and you try to try to figure it out for yourself? Like when you see these stories in the news, like how did they hit you?

Speaker 2:          01:30:37       Um, I wish I could be empathetic to like I've had ptsd nightmares where I wake up in a sweat, you know, and like I put my, my hand through the wall, you know, my wife's like, are you okay? You know, like that was years ago when I first came back after, you know, some bad rough trips. Um, so maybe I have some empathy to that, but I'm, the special forces unit by design is very tight and you know, like if you're having issues I can go to my team sergeant or I can go to my senior and bounce things off off of them. I get really resentful over people making snap judgments about these guys that are coming back and having issues, you know, like, Oh, you're a veteran. Is it safe for my kids to be around, you know, like hell yeah. They're like the greatest human beings on the planet. You don't like one in a million, have not one was a very small percentage have serious issues, but we have to have our eyes wide open about how to deal with posttraumatic stress and um, there's not one easy solution and it's a lot of hard work to get there.

Speaker 1:          01:31:39       It's not one easy solution. There's not one standard set of experiences that each veteran experiences over there and brings back with them. It's all, it varies. And that's such an important thing that you said about the coping mechanisms that you have in place. What, what's done to, to help veterans when, when, when they come back as far as like help them strengthen their coping

Speaker 2:          01:32:00       mechanisms, help them deal with situations. What kind of support did they offer you? So now, you know, we've been at war for a long time. We have a lot of things in place where, you know, frg the family readiness group is there for your family. So when you're coming back that your family has an understanding of what you've experienced or how to deal with you, you know, like, um, you know, not, hey, Saturday, you're going to be coaching kids softball Saturday night, you know, we have this, we're going to mom and dad's for, you know, they're not like overwhelming you with like American life, which is normal to everybody else, unless you've been in a plywood building for 12 months and now you're back surrounded without like thousands of people that you have no idea. It's weird. Um, so the military has done a way better job of trying to reintegrate soldiers back into normal life. But then you have a lot of great organizations that are, that are veteran started. And these guys really get it. You know, like, I'm Brian. Stan is great example. Hire heroes. You know, he's involved with getting these guys back to work. Um,

Speaker 2:          01:33:09       veterans outdoors, like a make wish foundation for wounded guys. So like if you have a serious physical ailment from battle, whether it's internal or physical, um, they'll give you these crazy things just to be like, hey, things are okay. You're still surrounded by friends, let's get you reconnected to a community that you're involved with and do something fun at the same time. So there's a lot of different ways. Like the worst thing though is when they start throwing pills at these guys, um, you know, the pharmaceutical approach. Whereas like, alright, let's put you on an antidepressant and hope for the best. There's a lot of that freaking retarded when, when you're over there, do they try to offer it to when you're actually in country? Uh, not, not like antidepressants, you know, there, there's pharmaceutical things like to keep you awake longer, to make you alert long.

Speaker 2:          01:34:00       I've had just like, you're in special forces. I, Hey, here's, you know this. Well, I mean even, even some great stuff, we're like over the counter things like I wish I had alpha brain when I was there, like, not, not plugging intentionally, but like, that stuff's fantastic. You're focused, you feel good, you're ready to go. You know, that would have been a thousand times better than, you know, like, Hey, here's, here's something that God just sent down for us to use. You know, it's, it'll keep you awake for three days. Awesome. What did they give you? What? I don't have no idea. You didn't even know what they were? Not really, but I know I was awake for three days. You know, I have friends who went over there and said they just gave him steroids. They gave him oral steroids. Why do you want, I've never done steroids.

Speaker 2:          01:34:42       Like I swear by law is holy and true. Um, the where they offered an available. Yeah. You know, but we have a special forces guy. He's 38 years old. This is his sixth, seventh combat tour. We're doing two, three, four hits and night a hits like missions. You know, we're doing mission followup, mission followup mission. We're doing a helicopter landing. We're doing a gap where we're on a ground assault force. And um, this guy is broken. He's hurt. His physically can't keep up joint. He needs it, you know. And do I want to like, do I want the 38 year old dude next to me that's on steroids or do I want the one that can barely walk because everything hurts so bad? Uh, oh, with a 38 year old on steroids.

Speaker 1:          01:35:23       Yeah. And that sort of brings up what we were talking about before where it's the, the discussion of tea, our tea when it comes to a mixed martial arts training, a testosterone replacement therapy for sewer. Yeah. For folks who don't know this, this debate, they're not mixed martial arts fans and now there's probably a lot of people listening to this that aren't, um, for a long time, over a year, two years, whatever it was, you were allowed to get prescribed testosterone. And Brendan Schaub said it best when we're discussing it on the podcast, he said that there's, there's youth and with youth you have elevated hormone levels, but you have a lack of experience. You have a lack of knowledge. And then as you get older you get wiser, you get smarter, you have more knowledge, but the body just does not respond the way it used to.

Speaker 1:          01:36:15       And Eve Edwards was talking to him and he was saying, you know, man, you know, he's like 37 now. And he's like, I know so much now, but my body just doesn't listen, just doesn't, doesn't do what it did when I was 20 and I didn't know as much and that this is the name of Eve. That's great guy. But there's that nature balance that is sort of stopped and it's placed with injections of testosterone and then you're introducing this weird element into one of the most dangerous sports competitions the world has ever known. Mixed martial arts. One of the most. There's more on the line as far as your emotions. Your physical body is at risk. There's always. And you're sort of. You're changing nature. You're making it so that these old wise people now are Jews to the gills and they can train 17 hours a fucking day and it gets real weird. It gets real weird. One that's for awhile was accepted by athletic commissions.

Speaker 2:          01:37:14       Yeah. The youth is wasted on the young, you know, like that expression is like you have now, you know, I'm 34. I've been doing martial arts for forever. I want the body of a 22 year old with what I know now. Right now, but I can chemically do that, you know, with through testosterone, which is what guys have been able to do for the past couple of years and it's dangerous, you know, like in, in, uh, if it was golf, I wouldn't care, you know, if it's baseball and like Sam was Sammy Sosa, mark mcgwire era. I don't really care, but we're in a sport where we're hitting each other in the face and choking each other unconscious. Um, we do not need the advantage of taking the years of experience of doing martial arts for 20 some odd years and then giving us bodies of 20 year olds, um, the physicality, the recovery, the responsiveness. It's, it's horrible. You guys have been doing it. And now we're at this, this, this juncture where we're now saying, okay, it's not okay. Like you can't have an athletic commission allow you to do it. So does that mean the guys are going to do it on the side and do orally? So they don't because they know where they're going to get tested or now they're not being monitored. So there's going to do it whenever and however they want. Like what does that mean? It's. It's scary.

Speaker 1:          01:38:31       It is. It's weird because there were a few guys that were on it for several years and they were being very successful while they were on it and then all of a sudden it gets pulled away. So what do they do? Do they try to bring their body up to natural levels? See, but that takes time. It takes a long time.

Speaker 2:          01:38:47       Yeah, for like a, I don't know, let's say a hypothetical 37 year old that's been on testosterone for four or five years and then he can't have it anymore. It's going to take that guy a long time if ever, to be able to naturally produce testosterone

Speaker 1:          01:39:01       and he'll never have the levels that he had when he was. No, because the levels he's had when he was on it for 25 year olds levels and the. The other thing is the things that you can take to bring your levels back up or also banned things like clomid and all these different. Their estrogen or estrogen suppressing devices. These all these different chemicals that people do post steroids cycle are also illegal, so it becomes like that was what I'm Dennis seaver got popped for. He got popped for one of these posts, steroids cycle things and now he's on the shelf for nine months because of this. People are like, wait, wait, why was that guy? He failed a drug test because he's blocking estrogen. Yeah, you have to or otherwise you're going to grow breasts after you've been using anabolic steroids and testosterone. It's like you have to, when you will see there's there's testosterone replacement.

Speaker 1:          01:39:54       Like if you went to a doctor and you said, Hey doc, I'm 60 years old. I would like to get on some testosterone and have a better quality of life. The doctor will give you a slow dose of testosterone slowly ramp you up. He's not gonna, Bam, Jack you and turn you into a 20 year old, but with a lot of fighters are doing is they're taking way more than you would have when you were 20 and what happens is your body goes, what the fuck is going on? And it grows tits. Literally, your body starts producing massive amounts of estrogen to counteract a massive amounts of testosterone in your body, gets so confused as to these levels of hormones that are completely supernatural in your body and under those conditions, under those conditions, you develop bitch tits and a lot of guys have had them and you'll see this weird like thing that you see these jelly like growing around their nipples. And I've seen guys, whether they bounce up and down in the cage and they're there, they have tents. It's

Speaker 2:          01:40:53       remarkable to me where people don't understand like we're a pugilistic sport, like guys are trying to take every advantage, every shortcut that they possibly can, you know, like you and I can look into dude and we like just from the texture of his skin. Um, can know, like if he's on a cycle, if he's off a cycle, if he was on a cycle, you know, like the texture of their skin. You mean like Zits on the asked me for acne scarring or what's possible that they have that naturally possible. Some guys, you know, it is a sign, it is a sign, you know, and then they have bitched hits another sign, another clue, you know, or like a guy looked one way five years ago when he was 32 and now he's 37 and he looks 10, 10,000 times better than he ever has in his whole entire life.

Speaker 2:          01:41:37       You're talking about Vito Belfort? No, I'm just kidding. I'm just giving you an example of perhaps another clue. Yes, I am. Just so we're not being unclear about that. Talk about what we were talking about before the show or is that the offer? No, no. Okay. So you know, he, he was the, he's a scapegoat I think a little bit for trt because there's a bigger problem for the, you know, for the entire sport where a, he in my opinion just personified a problem and then you know, everybody like pinned everything on him. But it was a big problem throughout the whole entire sports which is performance enhancing drugs. And is it right for a 37 year old dude like theater bell for it to be on testosterone for five years, look amazing and fantastic while he's on it and nothing like he did five years ago where he was struggling, you know, like winning a fight, losing a fight when now, now he's like knocking guys out with crazy fight of the night, fight of the year, like knockout of the night, knock out of the year type stuff.

Speaker 2:          01:42:37       Um, you know, you can't have that turnaround. And then like stopped testosterone and two months later he's ready to go. No, that's chemical, you know, like, that doesn't work that way. How does a guy get off of it in that short of a time and then have the ability to compete again? It would seem like it would take like a year to just, if ever. Yeah. Chemically. There's no way around it. No, there's, I, I, I'm, I'm not a doctor, you know. But having been a professional athlete for 13 years, I've never seen somebody that was so responsive to testosterone like, like he was. And then come clean and try to be an athlete like he like they wore when they are using performance enhancing drugs afterwards and just like miraculously been as good as they were when they are on. It never has never happened. I can't, I can't think of like a single sport, a single sportsmen in history where they got popped. They are watched closely and then performed as well after that point. You know, ever. Yeah. I completely agree with you that it's so different than baseball and all these other things. What I don't like about the baseball, a steroid controversy is that a young kid

Speaker 1:          01:43:51       who's coming up who wants to play baseball almost has to do it in order to compete. So when there's a guy like Mark Mcguire who's juice to the gills crushing the ball out of the stadium, a young guy coming up that wants to be like Mark Mcguire, most likely, unless you have incredible genetics and genetic specimen, just a weird freak of nature. Some, you know, some, some guy was just the extreme mesomorph you'll probably knock it ever be able to do that. And uh, yeah, that, that to me sucks that a young guy has to risk his endocrine system and put it in. But there's such a big difference between that and a combat sport. Yeah. Yeah. I don't know what the solution is.

Speaker 2:          01:44:33       Testing, testing right around testing random testing in fight camp post-fight, you know, like right now, um, you know, fought two weeks ago. I'm getting back into training two, three times a day. Like this is when you, this is when a guy test them, test them, you know, like, just show up high. Yeah. Joe Silva is about to throw an offer, you know, my way, let's say in to fight and 10 weeks, he knows he's gonna throw it off from my way before he throws the off from my way, a guy from the athletic commission to the respective state that I'm going to be fighting in shows up and says, Hey, pee in the cup. Um, that's how you're going to get a fair, equal system, you know, not where you sit. Tell a guy in Brazil, hey, you need to come up here and take a drug test. And he's like, Oh yeah man, I'll be there. And like four days. No, no dude, like athletic commission guy shows up the randomly and. Right they're feeding of the cup

Speaker 1:          01:45:28       and when you catch someone it can't. I think it should be more than nine months and you know, I think in this day and age you should let everybody know, hey look, we're going to cut you. You're not going to fight for this organization anymore. And let them know and then just say, this is the rule. This is, this is where we're at right now. So everyone's been served. Notice everyone knows what the repercussions are of this illegal activity that puts people in jeopardy. My real concern is medical science is not going to stop medical science and the. The innovative. Yeah, the, the way guys are going to sleep, not just cheap but just the things that they're going to come up with to, to change the human body. There's restorative capabilities of new advancements and new techniques. Like you could say that like getting in that cryo chamber.

Speaker 1:          01:46:18       If you can do that cryo chamber and another guy can't do that cryo chamber, do you have an advantage? Is it an unfair advantage? You know, where do you draw the line? Because should you be able to take creatine will create a teen's legal? Doesn't that increase muscle power? And it does, it increases your ability to work harder. It's like, where is the line? Can you take tribulus can you take on it's t plus we're having great results with that t plus stuff where guys are showing he's 50 percent increases in, in, in, in rates of lifting, and they're there the rate of progress over people that are not taking it and double blind placebos. Like what? When, when do you, when does it become legal and when it's become cheating, when is it like a nice supplement and when is it a performance enhancing drug?

Speaker 2:          01:47:04       I think one of the big things is what does it do to your body in the long run? You know, when you're using it as a supplement, we'll just call them all supplements that will just even remove performance enhancing drugs from, from, uh, the discussion, just a supplement that does in the short term great benefits in the long term, big damage. You know, when you have wwe stars that are dying at 41 from heart attacks, you know, and Lo and behold, they've been doing steroids for 12 years. You know, it's, it's tragic. It's sad, but not

Speaker 1:          01:47:35       pricing isn't a lot of those guys that the pain pills, those guys are folks who don't respect pro wrestlers either. I know a lot of people think that, oh, it's all fake. Silly. Those guys work hard at is image their bodies all the time. If you watch those guys flying through the air and jumping on each other, that's not a free ride. They're getting hurt all the time. And a huge problem in that world is guys that get hooked on pain pills, man. Well the damage

Speaker 2:          01:48:04       body, but then they have a show next Saturday. They have to like, you know, Mcmahon's like, no, you got to perform bro. That's like you're your own contract. You're going to get paid. Like, I can't move my hands right now. Like I can't use my fingers. All right, well take this, you know, now everything doesn't hurt and you'll be able to perform

Speaker 1:          01:48:24       because that's what's important. Yeah. Becomes like a thing where there's, there's things that you can take that elevate your body's natural production of testosterone and they, they can enhance your body's production, but what they don't do is introduced synthetic versions of it that shut down your endocrine system. What they don't do is give you these hyper human levels that are causing you to grow tits. You know, there's, there's got to be like a comfortable medium between eating healthy, having benefits like the cryo chamber and all these different things that do enhance recovery. But don't put you in your body in danger. Don't burn you out in the short term, you know, to give you the rest of your life. You're, you're fucked. You know, from 35 on, your body's just devastated.

Speaker 2:          01:49:09       It's, it's not going to be black and white. You know, it's not going to be a line drawn in the sand, you know, that line needs to be able to be moved, you know, it needs to have commissions and medical professionals that can adjust and adapt to what's happening, you know, with the growth of science, you know, like there's a reason why we're breaking records every Olympics. We're getting better, you know, like with the human body, how to make it perform better. I'm having people that are smarter than me, like figure out where those lines are and move them so that you don't have to get that line, has to be there, you know, um, it can be a mobile line that they, they move, you know, from year to year. But that line has to be there. And when guys step across it, um, you know, there has to be recut repercussions.

Speaker 1:          01:49:49       My concern is what's really going to happen in the future, which happens with almost anything that involves human innovation. Like if you look back at the cell phones of the 19 nineties where they had these fucking giant bricks and they'd hold them up to the head and have videos and now you can go anywhere in the world in a third world country, in a impoverished neighborhood, and people have these really small, incredibly complex cell phones that are just these magical devices that allow you to interface with the entire knowledge base of the world and they're. They're everywhere. I wonder what's going to happen when you have the kind of technology that they're working on right now, genetic engineering at a, at a cellular level where they're able to change people. I mean, I'm sure you're aware of the mild stat inhibitors like these things that they use with.

Speaker 1:          01:50:35       Well, they've demonstrated in whippets. These dogs were just because of breeding. Just a just a mistake and breeding. They've produced these super hyper muscular dogs that have double the muscle in cows as well. Have you ever seen those images? It's incredible, right? Well, people are being born just born with it. A kid in Germany was born just a genetic mistake or, or a benefit to him. Well, they're gonna be able to figure that out with a pill or the shot and you're fucking mailman is going to have it. Your mailman is gonna. Look like the hulk. And when that happens, when it's everywhere, what is, what do we do with athletes?

Speaker 2:          01:51:12       Have the Germans were trying it with your genetics. You know, like we've done it periodically throughout history. The spartans did it, you know, they did it at spartans do. They'd throw babies that didn't meet their requirements off the cliff. Yeah. This huge genetics at a very primal level of it happens in nature all the time where a mom will be like, this cup is not gonna be able to walk. I'm leaving it, you know? So like, that's your genetics. That's survival of the fittest. Now we as super too smart for our own good. Sometimes humans can take huge genetics and fix it with chemistry. That's scary. You know, where we can just magically pop out like superhuman. I don't. I don't know if I'm ready for that.

Speaker 1:          01:51:57       I don't know anyone's ready for the implications of what that means morally. If we don't get hit by an asteroid or invaded by aliens or blow each other up with nukes, it's common there. They're not going to stop. There's egg heads that are in laboratories right now that are constantly working on new shit and that's what they do and that's what humans do. We push the boundaries of innovation. We always have. It's part of what makes us human. It's why we're on a podcast right now talking to a microphone that neither you nor I could have ever figured out on her own. It's just a part of the program and they're going to figure out something, man. They're going to inject you with Nano bots or some sort of a new chemical that allows your body to work like Spiderman. I mean, you're going to fucking climb walls. You're gonna. You're going to have incredible balance. They're going to figure out a way to stop traumatic brain injury by reengineering the human mind. This is going to be a of crazy shit. It might not be in our lifetimes, but are killed. Our Children's children for sure are going to experience human beings that no one has ever experienced in the entire history of the, of the world itself. It's coming, it's coming by human innovation. It's gonna, leapfrog, evolution.

Speaker 2:          01:53:03       I'm not sure I want to. I'm going to kind of sad that I'm going to miss it. Maybe I want to reap the benefits of it, but then at the flip, I don't want to have to deal with, uh, the, you know, the implications of that.

Speaker 1:          01:53:16       I'm sad that I'm going to miss it too. Or we might not miss it. We might just catch the wave, but I'm also, I'm glad that I saw the world before. A lot of shit was. They're like, my kids are gonna grow up in a world. I have a 17 year old and she doesn't have any idea what life was like before the Internet. She has no idea. The Internet is always been there. She has a question. Oh, there's the answer. I grew up. I was retarded when I was her age and I put it in her head every day I go, let me tell you, if you met me, if I was 17 and you were 17, you would think, oh my God, this is the dumbest fucking guy that's ever walked the face of the earth, and he thinks he's so smart. I was an idiot.

Speaker 1:          01:53:53       I knew how to throw kicks and I knew which Stephen King books I liked. That's it. I knew what the right combination of words to say to get a girl to fuck me sometimes. That's it. That's all I knew. I was a moron. Like what a 17 year old knows today as opposed to what they knew when I was. Now the future is going to be even crazier than that, but at least I got a perspective. I got to see what it was like to grow up where you didn't know if you called someone and they weren't home. They just weren't fucking home. You know? I remember when answering machines were invented where people were like, Holy Shit

Speaker 2:          01:54:30       again, the Internet and you'd hear this, and it was slow. As fuck, and if you wanted to see a picture of something or be like click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click, white and green. Yeah. Variations of those three. Oh yeah, yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:54:48       I remember when Internet searches first came about to when you first find. I got a great story. There was a, we don't even need to say the name of the organization, but a buddy of mine used to be co owner of a small mixed martial arts organization and this was in the late nineties and they were just starting to promote fighters through the Internet and they were just starting to do bios where they would research a guy through the internet where they researched this guy and they find out that a guy with the exact same name, one something called the hungry as but contest. Oh No. So they're, they're gladiator there. Heavyweight, there, Adonis, six foot four, shredded man with his penthouse pet girlfriend, you know, that he would parade around at all these events. Also had done gay porn. And so, uh, they pulled down the picture, these downloads and pictures,

Speaker 3:          01:55:44       and my friend described as like, Isi, click, click, click, click, click, click, you know, have those pictures would slowly show up on a 56 k modem. It would like, you would get the top of it and it would slowly start to pan down. And as it pans now what that looks like, his hair, click the click that looks like it could be his forehead. Click well that's his eyes. Click, click, click. That's dig in his mouth. Oh my God. And this is a ticket his ass. Oh my God. There was two guys using him like Chinese finger handcuffs. And they're like, whoa. And so this dude had no idea that, that was even possible to internet. He'd used the same name, you know, he just figured and no one is going to look that up. But homos. And then they did. Yeah. When they said, you know, he needed a lot of money and they gave him some money.

Speaker 3:          01:56:27       So he did it once. Turn. I did like 100 films, you know, it was a lot. He's doing really good. How good could it be? The joke is I would say, you know, what is a lot of money mean to you? A lot of money to me means I do one gay porno and I live like in a video for the rest of my life and I'm in my underwear with two bottles of cristal on a yacht with a thousand models forever. That's. We did 100 porns. He should have all the money on the planet by my calculations. There's no one Richard ever anywhere. And it fucking is con fuck everyone has ever lived. Has got. Who's got money? That guy would have all the money. Every country would be bankrupt and this guy's bank account would have all the cash. Yeah, but the thing is it's just like no one knew before that, that an internet search was a possibility. And think about how many people that have done things that just had no idea what you're going to be able to find that out. Like how could and now and find it out on your phone just.

Speaker 2:          01:57:27       Yep. And be able to access the person that said content is about like, no, never in our history in May kinds existence have we been able to connect so effortlessly to so many different people, you know, like, like a fan that doesn't like me. You can just get on twitter and like tell me that I'm a baby killer. Like just because, you know, or they can do anything anytime, anywhere and they can, you know, like you can find out anything about anybody and then probably breached that person,

Speaker 3:          01:57:55       especially a fighter or someone who's got a social media account or a president of a social media account. You know, like there's a few folks that I know that just avoid it all together, but they don't have to do it.

Speaker 2:          01:58:06       50 million people here, like almost all of them, like $300

Speaker 3:          01:58:10       and Mexicans, 14 account Mexicans. It's probably another 50 million a lease. I don't know. Who knows how many. I love Mexicans, don't get me wrong, but there's a lot of them that aren't taking the census. Um, how often do you get fucked with on social media? All the time. All the time

Speaker 2:          01:58:27       I, I guess I'm like a polarizing figure. I don't know how I think I'm a likable guy, but some for some reason

Speaker 3:          01:58:33       people have a problem with strength. People have a problem with competence. People have a problem with, with folks that have strong opinions or controversial opinions,

Speaker 1:          01:58:42       and instead of those, well, you know, you should. I think anybody who's paying attention to the world and sees all the contradictory information that we're receiving, sees the chaos, sees, just sees how fucked our political system is. Our financial system. If you don't have strong opinions, if you don't have controversial opinions, you're not paying attention to your eyes. You know? I mean, I can't tell you how many conversations I've had about gun control just about guns itself. I'm like, God damn, guns aren't the problem. It's people that use guns that are the problem. You leave, uh, you know, that old adage, guns don't kill people. People kill people and people will fucking argue that to the end of time. God dammit. It's true. Every time you go to the gas station, you got a store in that gas station that sells the lighters. You got fluid that comes out of a pump and anyone can just light people on fire. I mean it's it. Anyone can do it. It hasn't happened that often, but anyone can do it.

Speaker 2:          01:59:41       Or just take your car and turn two degrees to the right and run down the sidewalk. Yeah. The, the option to kill is always there. It's always there. It's a choice, you know? And they're like, but it's a tool. It's a mechanism that serves no other purpose. You know, a car can get you from point a to point b. So why do they need a gun with him? The only thing it does is kill you. Like I could say the same thing about a tractor. If I wanted to know, like if I wanted to make a killer tractor, the only thing that's designed for us to kill because I put spikes on its wheels, you know, and it's not, doesn't excavate anything besides human souls, but no, it's the choice to kill, you know, it's like get over it. Get people killed

Speaker 1:          02:00:19       it is is a way that they can do it easily and that is an issue, but

Speaker 1:          02:00:26       it's also why does a person have the ability to do that and how come so little effort and so little emphasis is on what causes a person to be able to disconnect or to be able to have so much hate and anger in their heart that they can kill a bunch of school children, that they can use a gun to shoot up a mall like, wow, why isn't that the subject of discussion and why is it always the tool for madness? It's not the madness itself is the tool of madness, but that same tool can be used by anyone else to do a million other things. It's like it's a bad analogy, but it's one that I always use with marijuana. People go, Oh, you could ruin your life if you smoke pot. You could. You could also take a hammer and hit yourself in the Dick. You know, should. Should we make hammers illegal? Because you can. Because the hammer is just a tool. If you take marijuana and just enjoy it and you don't hurt anybody, should that person be penalized because someone decided to just wake and bake every day and then fucking go into debt and wind up. It's humans are the problem in human weakness and a lack of character and all sorts of chemical imbalances

Speaker 2:          02:01:35       or the culture and the structure around the person that led them to make these horrific decisions and actions. You know, that they use whatever tool, don't care what it is, gun knife, everything up to that point is what we should. The emphasis of trying to understand or prevent an acknowledged and research should be done, not take away, you know, whatever it was. That was the end conclusion. It's all the things up to that point that's that are important that nobody pays attention to, nobody cares about.

Speaker 1:          02:02:05       That's what was ridiculous about it. Any sort of control, gun control, knife control, bow and Arrow control debate. It's not that. It's what constitutes what went, what makes a human being capable of horrific things, and I think you're uniquely qualified for a bunch of reasons. One, because you have a family, you know what it's like to raise a person and to. You've seen the consequences of human beings when they're in this environment that is totally fucked from from the jump and you see these religious fanatics and you see fundamentalism, you see chaos and a land that's just just overrun with it. You see it's. It's humans. It's the development of humans

Speaker 2:          02:02:49       and an error. They use the development erroneously, like the development of human, the wrong way. There's the right way and there's not. There's the right way. There's about a billion right ways. Yeah, there's a couple of wrong ways, you know, in a couple of wrong ways, end up with bad products

Speaker 1:          02:03:07       and it's again, it's sort of contradictory thing that through through combat and through, especially through martial arts, I think that the deepest bond of commitment that I've ever experienced was outside of my family is the friends that have trained with and people that have competed with that, that have just. You see them. You know who the fuck they are. When you see a guy breaking training, when you see a guy with 30 seconds to go in the ground, put his hands down on his knees and just take deep breaths and step away, and then you see the coach go get back in there and you see them suck it up and you know, there's the guys who would suck it up and it's guys who don't and you see the difference, you see who they are, you see their soul, you see, and you learn about people that way in a way that a lot of folks don't ever get a chance to learn even about themselves.

Speaker 2:          02:03:55       The refiner fire, the refiner's fire is like this beautiful thing. You know, it's a refiner's fire. Refiner's fire. Yeah. So get you take a metal refineries. Yeah. Right. Okay. When you're making a sword, you know, the, the folding process of heating it up and pounding out the impurities and 14 and again, and pounding out the impurities. Impurities. Like the hotter the fire, the more bad stuff gets cooked out. Um, that's the same with people. You know, you put them in a room that's hot, put them in a Ge that's hot. I'm around a whole bunch of other dudes that are like trying to choke each other out and kill you. You get glimpses of the depth and hardness of somebody's character and soul and see awesome snapshots and even kids like down at the youngest level, putting them into competitions of martial arts. You see the exact same thing. You see the development of this character and if somebody's soul, as they get tougher and deeper, you know, as a, as a human, and you get in indy snapshots, you get a clear glimpse of who that person is, what's, what's, what's part of them. Like it's cool, it's cool.

Speaker 1:          02:04:59       Strong Gracie said it best. He said, uh, you know, uh, I, I reserve judgment until I've trained with you. Now he said, I think you know me. You know, you seem like a nice guy, but I reserve judgment until I've trained with you, which is such a great way to put it. And you know, a lot of people think we're cool. I don't want a fucking train. You don't have to. It's not that it's just you should in your life do something difficult. It is not martial arts. Maybe it's mountain climbing, maybe it's hiking. Maybe I'd run anything. Doesn't matter. Do something that's hard to do. Maybe it's write a book. Find out what your fucking barriers are because the most reprehensible thing, the thing that we all pretty much universally despised is a spoiled rich kid, a spoiled kid that never had to work for anything.

Speaker 1:          02:05:45       They were handed at their whole life, their parents never gave them values, and what did they do? They grow up yelling at servants and then they become some rich asshole. That's a sociopath. I mean that is the. That's. That's a key character in so many movies that's in so many books, literature, we all can relate to that person who didn't earn it, who got that place without hard work and how gross they are. I hate that pussy. Fucking everybody does. You're supposed to. It's supposed to. They're not supposed to be there. It's not supposed to happen. You're not supposed to win the lottery like that. That fucks you up.

Speaker 2:          02:06:17       But the really remarkable ones that are the ones that could or have access to all of that and then choose not to, or on the total flip side, the guys that have access to none of that and challenge themselves and put themselves through hardships that the altos, you know, that like they have nothing. And just through hard work determination, they become something, you know, like those are two complete polar opposites of a human that I just like, I adore. You know, like I said in the military, you see these guys are like, you were like this Ivy League, Super Rich, you're enlisted. Why are you here? You know, you could have done anything. They're like, I wanted to be here. Like I love you. You're amazing. You know. And then then the flip side, you know, the, the Puerto Rican that his parents swam over here or on some pourable boat and um, you know, they're one generation removed and they have like they put themselves through college or maybe they joined the military so they could go to college and their ethics, this exact same point of their life as this rich Yuppie guy that are just there because they want to see how hard they are, how far they can push themselves.

Speaker 1:          02:07:27       Yeah. Humans beings are just, we are just a mass of potential and it's awesome to see someone rise through adversity and reach a potential that elevates us all. Because when you see someone reach their potential or reach out very high level of, of anything, it changes the way you look at what's possible. When you see a guy who gets up at 6:00 in the morning, the alarm clock goes off and he just fucking hits those hills and starts running and he does it every morning before work. You Go, fuck, I'm a bitch. I'm just a weak bitch. I don't do that. Fuck. And then it changes your perspective. You want to do that too. You want to absorb a little bit of that guy strengthened that feeling that you get from being around that guy. It's empowering or you're one of those guys that diminishes that and tries to squash it because you're insecure and you wanna you wanna tweet, Tim Kennedy, you fucking bitch.

Speaker 1:          02:08:19       You look you in the mood to you mean, you know there's, there's folks like that too. I think that strength is the best antidote for a lot of the weaknesses that we find in our society that we consider to be strength. Like bullies. People say like, what's the best solution to bullies? Teach them how to fight. Teach them all how to fight everyone. I think that is a core problem with men. Men have a giant fear hanging over their head all day long and that is being dominated by other men. You know, I mean is what led me to martial arts 100 percent was I was scared of dudes kicking my ass. So I got into martial arts as a very young kid because of that. And I think that the more kids, if we had programs in school where we taught martial arts to kids in class, you would have so few instances of bullying.

Speaker 1:          02:09:11       I think the dramatic decrease in bullying and the respect that people have for each other would change the respect that people have for themselves. Like a bully cannot respect themselves. They just can't. Unless there's some sort of a complete sociopath. You're not, you're, you're not going to be happy with yourself if you pick on someone smaller than you, you're doing it because you're insecure. But if you weren't insecure or you were less insecure or you had some sort of sense of personal sovereignty because of training, you would have less of this, this inclination to do something shitty to someone like that. Yeah, it'd be cool to see. Fuck him, man. I think martial arts programs should be mandatory in school, just like they have pes mandatory for. For Boys, especially martial arts should be.

Speaker 2:          02:09:54       And you want to. You want to see what you want to see your kid have discipline, focus, understanding of, right and wrong. A little bit of confidence. Restraint, martial arts, that's why you did it. So you didn't get beat up. I, I did it because, um, our second born, I was a crazy middle kid, you know, my dad's like at a very early age like you are going to be doing martial arts, you know, so like I was like nine. And I remember saying a bad word on the mat and having, you know, my, my sensei come up with an a scream of stick and hit me in the back of the head and like I'm, I missed up and doing stuff. And he's like, ah. And then I said a bad word when I messed up. And then bow, you're like, I didn't say that bad word again. And, but more importantly I was able to control myself, which was the elements, the necessary element that I needed.

Speaker 1:          02:10:42       And also this, the great feeling of accomplishment that you get when you learn that you can control yourself. When you feel yourself improving, your feel, your character improving and you have a difficult situation and you navigate it successfully. And he goes, oh, I'm a better person now than I was when I was whatever, when I was young and stupid. And that's just one of those things where everybody wants to be comfortable. Everybody wants to look towards their golden age and everybody wants to retire and sit on the couch and put your feet up. That's horseshit. That's not you. You only. You only can experience that and enjoy it if you've earned it. No one wants to earn it. The earning is the most important part of your life. Individual risks,

Speaker 2:          02:11:25       possibility. Nobody has it. You've got to earn it. You've got to work for it. You gotta you know so much better when you do.

Speaker 1:          02:11:32       Yes. Well, that's why I think guys like you were important, man. I think you set a great example of that. I think you said a great example with your words. I think you set a great example with your actions. It's one of the reasons why I've been wanting to talk to you on the podcast. You're a very inspirational guy in my opinion. I think you, the way you talk about things and the way you express yourself, it's, it's admirable and I think it, it helps people, it, it sets a very high standard and I think setting a high standard is one of the key things that young men and young, I'm sure young women as well need in life. They need to see a high standard.

Speaker 2:          02:12:07       I'm not perfect. I make mistakes probably way too much or more often than I'd like to admit, but I'm always searching and seeking to get better know, like, and I think that's something that I always tried to project. Um, you know, and the only way to get theirs is like you've just said, it's, it's through hard work. It's through determination. It's, you know, it's, it's through the amazing innate part of the human being, which is the ability to do, you know, and to not quit and to have the inner strength to try to achieve and surpass whatever it was before.

Speaker 1:          02:12:41       And there's beauty in imperfection. You know, this idea that you're going to be this enlightened, quite Chang Kang character electing the TV show. You got to take a leak. Good head on. I saw you drinking that gigantic smartwater. There's dudes who have bladders like mine who could just power through a three hour podcasts and then this guys like Tim Kennedy, you know, it's cool. It's like, you know, we all learn. We just, we show, we show that there's, there's higher levels. My fucking bladder bro. It's like a duffle bag that you can carry guns in. It's large and it's durable and it gets dirty and filled with liquid, but don't worry about it. I can hang in there. Um, what I was saying to Tim that's important is I think everybody has this idea that there's some guy out there that's like jet Li that's like a perfect person.

Speaker 1:          02:13:28       Some, some character. There's the beauty really in the imperfection. The beauty is in knowing that we're all just these weird, flawed creatures that are trying to figure out. It's not even that we're flawed. It's just that we're, we're dealing with an impossible amount of variables that we're constantly navigating. And this idea that you should have gotten it right. It's not what it is. It's the idea is that you learn from what you get wrong and then that thing you don't do the same way next time he say, you know what? I made a mistake the last time I was in a similar situation. Now I know that, and so now I'm going to power through with the knowledge that I've accumulated in my life from my past mistakes. That's a, that's a huge factor about being a person of huge factor is that we're all learning from each other.

Speaker 1:          02:14:25       And uh, I said a lot of cool shit when you're gone, but that is a that. But learning and learning from each other is the whole reason why it's great to have inspirational people to draw from. And I think that now there's never been a time like this where you could just go on youtube and you could be inspired for 24 hours a day, seven days a week. You could watch videos of guys pushing through things. Guys are doing fucking hundred mile ultra marathons and just seeing people talk about the things that inspire them and what pushes them. There's never been a time like this. We just, inspiration is available everywhere. You look

Speaker 2:          02:15:08       in a whole bunch of different. Not Everybody's inspired the same way, you know, like I think it's amazing to see a guy that has nothing, do something remarkable to come, you know, not the underdog, but that has no resources that then there's this guy in Austin, Texas, his, he runs this running group called Gilbert Gazelles and um, the who to, when the genocide that was occurring, he has these burns on his body because his family was murdered and he was piled into this pile of bodies and set on fire. And once the militias, I'm Ryan left from the Hutu in Tutus, he got up and started running. Then he went to the NCAA and started running there and then he went to the Olympics and now he runs. He's an inspirational dude in Austin that just tells people to run. And he's one of the most remarkable human beings. And there's, there's tons of people out there that are so amazing and remarkable. And you can, if you just look, you can find them. And then that I, I love latching onto people like that and just trying to get into what's in there and try to not, I don't want to say steal it, but I want some of that.

Speaker 1:          02:16:16       Yeah, well you don't steal it because they still have it. Oh, they'll always have it, but yeah. But you absorb some of it. Yeah. It's very important. We, we, we surround ourselves with inspirational people and become inspired. Surround yourself with negative and your life is going to be a wreck. And that's a lot of people don't realize that and they just try to work through these negative constant life. You've got to cut them off, man. You got to cut them off and keep moving because they will hold you back. There are crabs in that bucket and when you try to reach the top of that bucket, they will latch ahold of your little crab legs and drag you down with them.

Speaker 2:          02:16:48       Data was so, you know, retrospectively my dad was so wise. So when he's like, no, you don't want those guys around, you know you're going to be who you surround yourself with. You know? And it's like, whatever, that guy is,

Speaker 1:          02:16:58       cool, Haley, that guy, you know, and now I'm like, God, it's hard. How did he know so early. There's always gonna be people that will. But those people are also important because you, you learn, you know, you learn from watching them fuck their lives up. I've never done cocaine. And one of the reasons why I never did cocaine is because I grew up with a buddy of mine who's cousin was selling cocaine and I watched this guy fall apart. He, they, him and his girlfriend would just do blow and they would hide out in their place and they would, they had this attic apartment and they would just fucking watch tv all day and they would shrink. Like their fucking face was shrinking, their body was shrinking. The all they would do is do coke. I don't even know if they ate, you know? And I watched this guy, it was like a guy who got bit by a vampire and became like this disease thing.

Speaker 1:          02:17:46       And I went, Whoa, keep the fuck away from coke, you know? And I didn't have to do coke and go to rehab and pull myself out, you know, I, you know, I lived 40 plus years of my life with no desire to do coke. Fuck that. And so it's not always good. You need losers. You know, losers are there too for a reason. It's the whole world was filled with inspirational winters. Like how would you figure out where, where do we begin? If everybody's a fucking winner now you got to see people who ring that bell, right? You got to see people who tap out quick. You got to see a guy who tapped before the choke is even sunk in. Like, what are you doing? Types two taps to strikes. Well, you know, sometimes GSP versus Matt Serra, sometimes it's good to tap to strikes because fights over go anywhere. When the guys on top of you dropping bombs and you're starting to see sparks and the elevator doors closing, do you think tap strikes is a bad idea?

Speaker 2:          02:18:41       I don't know if I have it in me. I don't know. Like right. I'm not saying it's bad idea. Maybe I should respect the guy that smarter than I am, you know, like I'm kind of like an oak. I'm big, I'm strong and I'm dumb, you know, like I'm just, I'm going to grow and I'm gonna do what I do. Um, maybe I wish I was smart enough to tap two strikes. I don't think I am. I just don't. I don't think I have it in me to be like, okay, I'm not going to get outta here. I'm just going to quit.

Speaker 1:          02:19:08       I don't think there's any problem with tablets, trucks, but I respect your viewpoint. I know what you're saying. And I think you'd probably have to have that sort of mentality to be an elite level competitor in something like mma where that's not even an option in your head. And this guys don't tap, you know, a good fucking war machine. You just gets choked out. There's a lot of guys that just say, I never tap. I will go out. I'll get my arm broken. Fuck it. I'm not tapping. It's not in there. Yeah, it's not. Look good. John Jones, we fought vittorio, his arms completely, hyper extended tap ladder, got let it get completely popped backwards and then won the fight. Anyway,

Speaker 2:          02:19:42       [inaudible] is to, before you go to special forces selection, there's this phase four guys out the street called [inaudible] special operations preparation course. The only thing that is isn't a trigger. They take like 400 dudes and they ended up sending 80, 80 of them to selection the other 320 at some point. Either got broke or quit. Um, I remember seeing the Gong that you go up and hit and it's like, so longingly looking at that thing being like, that's the smart thing to do. Like, you know, you have blisters on your feet that you've injected stuff into so that you can't say like your skin, like glues back to what portion it separated itself from, you know, like you've lost 20 pounds in the course of 30 days and um, and you're looking at that Gong and you're like, a smart person would go and hit that goal, you know? And I watched guys go up and do it and I was like, that's, that's a smart person probably I didn't have it in me. So I'm maybe I'm dumb. I think that's my take. I'm either like too dumb, you know, like there's a balance there and I think we're kind of a green each other from, with each other, from different perspectives.

Speaker 1:          02:20:48       Well I think the, you're, you're being self deprecating. When you calling yourself dumb, it's not a dumb thing. But if you wanted to be smart about the amount of punishment that you endure, yeah. But if you wanted to build the highest level of character and durability and mental toughness possible, then it would be dumb to hit that gun. I don't know. Because the benefits of not hitting that Gong is what you are today. I would have got a cup of coffee and a hot breakfast. You didn't. I didn't get a cup coffee today. And, and have the knowledge that you didn't hit that golf. It's a good looking gong. I could go back, I might have. You're a thick guy for 185 pounds. Like your, your built in a very, you're very muscular weight class toward my wife uses. What do you, what, what do you walk around that before you start your cut

Speaker 2:          02:21:40       to like day of cut?

Speaker 1:          02:21:42       No, like what? Like if you, if you had a fight that was four months from now and you don't have to worry about your weight, what are you going to work? Way To? Twenty to 20. Wow. And did you fight light heavyweight at all?

Speaker 2:          02:21:54       Yeah, I think at wcs heavyweight ifl is a light heavyweight. Middleweight and then I've stayed at middleweight.

Speaker 1:          02:22:02       Wow. So when you, if you're walking around in the two hundreds, how do you navigate a weight cut to get down to 185 pounds? Because that is a big issue in mma is that point of diminishing returns where some guys like Anthony Rumble Johnson. Perfect example. God, he's good at two. Oh five. Jesus Christ. The kid was so fucking big in between fights. I see him walking around. He was fighting at one 74. Kevin Burns and I saw him like two months later it was 2:30. I go, what the fuck are you? He's a house. He was bigger than, or I mean he was just, he was on inside mma would fade or, and he was towering over them wider, thicker. You're like, what is going on? And then finally he gets his shit together, decides to come back as a light heavyweight and dominate sill Davis at two. Oh five. And you're like, okay, this kid was obviously past the point of diminishing returns. He was, he was diminishing his own ability to perform by cutting so much. Wait, what is that number?

Speaker 2:          02:23:03       It's, I think it's different for every athlete and person, you know, and um, you know, when I'm, when I'm to 15 to 20, I feel like I'm a juggernaut. I never have training related injuries, you know, like I, I'm running an extra three, four percent body fat. I'm just like all around healthier. My brain's working right. You know, like my libido is good, you know, I'm sleeping very soundly, all eight hours, you know, like things, everything's great. You know, like when I'm down to like that, that one 95, one 93 precut type weight, you know, we're like that five percent body fat. My brain's not firing on all cylinders, you know, like it's libidos rough. You're training three, four times a day. Like just things suck. I'm like, everything hurts. You get down to five percent body fat when you're like one 95 [inaudible] are you doing, how are you measuring it?

Speaker 2:          02:23:56       A pinch test water stuff. The water tanks and then um, the calipers, that's a lot that's really low and then you're going to cut another 10 pounds. Just water, 10 pounds of water. I think our final cuts usually like eight pounds of. But you know, you're like, my body doesn't. I don't think it even recognizes like I'll, I'll cut. I fought Michael Bisbing us probably two. Oh five when I fought him, you know, I weighed in at one or one 86 the day before, you know, and then 30 hours later, you know, I've been eating and drinking and feeling fantastic. Do you recruit for that? How many apps do you use? 1,500 milliliters to 2000 leaders like the greener. I honestly don't know. Fighters that don't. Right. And nowadays, yeah, pretty much everybody does. Unless you're like a frankie edgar that literally weighs in at what he fights that maybe it was like pretty rare weights in his pocket.

Speaker 2:          02:24:52       Yeah. Frankie fought at 1:55 and weighed 1:55. Liotta machita fought a two. Oh three for the longest time. And you know, weighed in at two. Oh, three for 200, five pound weight class. But look how good he is at 1:45. Better, much better. You know. So the diminishing returns, like it's different for everybody. Um, you know, I'm 5:11, you know, I have a 73 inch reach. There's no way I can hang with the tool fibers that have 86 and teaches, you know, that are six foot four. Um, yeah, it might be as strong as they are, but I'm like, uh, like as Brian Stan calls me like a squat, a little hobbit, angry hobbit, sometimes troll endearingly. He refers to me as these things, but he's right and I just can't reach them. You know, like John Jones can runs around the cage, you know, jabs me to death and then when I tried to like athletically explode in, then he violates me with something painful. Yeah. Do you ever

Speaker 1:          02:25:45       think about going one 70? Is that possible?

Speaker 2:          02:25:47       Definitely possible. Yeah. Yeah. We've um, honestly had robbie lawler beat Johnny Hendricks. I always out I would cut to fight Robbie.

Speaker 1:          02:25:57       Really? Because you beat Robbie and strikeforce? Yeah. Do you, um, do you when you walk around at two? Oh, five or 2:20 rather. Is it because you're lifting weights is because you're doing a lot of.

Speaker 2:          02:26:09       Yeah, yes. Um, I like, I treat the annual cycle of like fight camp, post fight camp, pre fight camp, fight camp fight. And I'm Kinda, if you look at like a, like an nfl player, you know, they have the pre season where there they're trying to get their body strong and healthy so that when they go into the season they have everything that they need to, to perform during that season. Um, so like my pre fight camp, like right now where I'm lifting weights, doing a high volume of work where I'm working on like my, my sparring stuff now is a lot more drill oriented. I'm not burning tons of calories grappling or boxing or sparring, kickboxing. I'm lifting a lot of weights so my body's responsibly like getting healthy, big and strong. Again, I'm getting my technique better. So when I move into that fight camp, I have this mold of clay that's totally healthy, that can be shaped into what needs to be shaped to be executed for, for a particular fight.

Speaker 1:          02:27:07       So when you think about like 2:20 and the garlic rumble Johnson who used to weigh somewhere around that even heavier and get down to one 70 crazy. If you were going to get down to one 70, if Robbie lawler beat Johnny Hendricks, how would you do that? Would you cut out the weightlifting and start doing like marathon running? Like what would you do to get yourself leaner?

Speaker 2:          02:27:25       Yeah. Um, what would it be leaner or would it be like less muscle? A little bit of both. I definitely have to lose a little bit of muscle to be able to.

Speaker 1:          02:27:34       And how would you do that? By not lifting or

Speaker 2:          02:27:36       just changing the type of lifting that I'm doing, you know, like I'm, I'm not doing those three rep max is, have dead lifted, you know, four or 500 pounds. So what'd you do these days? Yeah, like right now. Yeah, absolutely unloving it, you know, it's like I did shrugs yesterday. Just shrugged. Well not, not just drugs, but I got to do shrugs as actually my strength because I'm like, can we do some curls? You shut your mouth, you know, it's like, like straps that you never allowed to touch those. And I was like looking at those, but like how can I use some straps that looks good and grab the bar and do some more weight, you know, he's like, no. Now the point of departure is calm and he's like, come back to me Tim, and we're not doing curls. I'll let you do drugs. But that's all you know, like, so straps being you don't do straub's because you only want to lift with your hands. Can hold up. What's the point? Yeah. I don't

Speaker 3:          02:28:22       ever use straps. I, I see people using straps and I, I get it. I get what you're doing. What's use straps functionally though, she'd be whatever you could carry with your hands too. Especially for a grappler, right? Yeah, absolutely. So you would just start doing high reps doing high volume a lot more speeds. Like I think I think I'd have to be faster to at one 70, you know like watching these guys are just like all over the place and you see like Damien Maia when he dropped down to one 70 and you know, fought rick story and to see like the difference in the, just the, the amount of physical strength that he had over a guy who was used to fighting at one 70. It's a big leap. Do you think there should be more weight classes? Yeah, I do too. Yeah, I think the one 85 to 205.

Speaker 3:          02:29:08       Jesus fucking Christ. That's 20 pounds. There should be three champions in between those weight classes or at least to. Yeah, I mean if you look at a guy from, I'll go all the way down from like 1:55, two, two. Oh five. You know you have 55, 70, 85. You have four weight classes from 1:55 to two. Oh five. That's crazy. Yeah. Yeah, I agree. I think it's crazy and I think that, you know, a lot of people say that boxing is watered down by all the weight classes. I think it's watered down by all the titles, but I don't think there's anything wrong with having a welterweight class at 1:47 and then a junior middleweight at 1:54 and then the middle weighted one 66 pounds, but you 1:54 and one slash 60 is fucking significant. Six pounds and significant 20 pounds is crazy and I just think that there's just a, a lot of fighters who are tweeners like Diego Sanchez.

Speaker 3:          02:29:55       I think Diego should be fighting at one 65, you know, I think when he gets to 1:55, I think he's to diminished you scrawny when he fights at one 70. He's a little soft, these little little small for some of those really big giant dudes. I think I'm kind of between 85 and one 70, like my shape, my reach, my height, and you're like, I would love there to be like a 180. Yeah. I really should be more of that in the everything. Those are the things that I would like to use to change the, the downward elbows and knees on the ground and more weight class except a lot of problems. Dana, can we go ahead and execute these things that Joe and I have concurred on from today's podcast? Yes. It's not even Dana. It's the athletic commissions through. That's what's really crazy is that it's sanctioned by athletic commissions and you really don't have that much influence over athletic commissions. Yeah. Especially, well now the Keith Kaiser's gone. Maybe they have a little bit more, but I don't know how much they listen. I, I wish they would listen about a few things for certainly downward elbows and certainly at least consider revamping the scoring system and then adding weight classes. Um, one of the things about weight cutting, do you find that are an issue like the, there's obviously an issue with injuries and there's obviously an issue with diminishing health. Do you worry about the long term repercussions

Speaker 1:          02:31:20       of like there was an article recently, Jim Miller was talking about weight cutting. He's like, I know I've taken years off my life through weight cutting. Do you worry about that?

Speaker 2:          02:31:30       I do. The things that I am really conscious about my brain, you know, when I'm cutting weight I like, I love reading, I love writing, you know, like even, you know, creative writing too. Like I love. Do you write a blog? Do you keep a blog or anything? Yeah, for me. Just for you? Yeah. You're going to publish it some day. Maybe. There are a couple of times where I wrote a, wrote some blogs when I was deployed, um, letters from a foreign land and I'm like, people love, like I'm an okay writer, I'm not the best like anyways, everybody. So worse credit, um, and when I'm cutting like my brain doesn't work right? Like I feel it. And um, and then when you're getting hit in the head while you're cutting, you know, from guys like John Jones and Carlos condit, you know, like, life sucks, your brain sucks. So I'm like, yeah, I have my eyes are wide open that there's, you know, physically going to be some repercussions to me fighting, you know, for me, jumping out of airplanes for like, at what point do I say, okay, I'm not going to do this because it hurts me in the long term. You know, like

Speaker 1:          02:32:40       you're 34. Yeah. Do you have a cutoff? Do you have like an age where you're like, this is the age where I don't want to be doing this anymore. Definitely. What you would tell you, you can't tell me. Okay. But you have a number in your head where you would like a goal to reach.

Speaker 2:          02:32:56       I love randy couture and Dan Henderson and I had to get some of the. They had send the greatest fights towards the end of their careers. I am not going to be fighting at 40, you know, I'm not gonna be fun

Speaker 1:          02:33:05       fighting my late thirties, you know, like, Oh, you told me the number then that's the only you don't leave in five years ago there. Yeah. You got a five year window then. Wow.

Speaker 2:          02:33:15       Yeah. No Way. I got too much. I want to do. What do you want to do? Um, I want to change people's lives. You know, I want, I want to be able to impart individual responsibility. People. I want to save some animals. I want to own a hudson more. Um, I want to make some awesome TV shows and try to TV shows. Uh, so duck dynasty. No, I do not want to do duck dynasty at all and I don't even think I've ever seen a full episode, but I haven't. Maybe I've seen like three quarters of an episode. But you done lost your red neck from our rear admiral. Those guys took values that they wanted to project and they figured out a conduit to do it. We might call them idiots and they have horrible accents and they do stupid things. And um, but they had a set of morals that they try to convey and they found an avenue to reach out millions of people, you know, like I want that platform because I have some good things to say, you know, and I, I think I want to have an

Speaker 3:          02:34:18       opportunity to make a difference. Why don't you do a podcast, start off with the podcast, do a podcast now. Be like one of the first mma guys mean Brendan Schaub does one with Brian Cowen. But Brendan's kind of a meathead, let's be honest. He's a great guy. Love Him. But you're so like, you're intimidating and smart. Like, how could I compete with the Joe Roadblock as, fuck, I don't blow smoke up my ass. I know what you're doing. I'm not that smart. You are? Nope. Nope. The argument with Joe because he doesn't forget anything and he's deceivingly smart. I was like, I'm aware of these things. I definitely look dumber than I am for sure. But that's not saying much because they look really fucking stupid. I used that to my benefit as well. It's like I'm an infantryman immigrant. I'm an MMA fighter. I'm dumb. Talk Shit to me.

Speaker 3:          02:35:03       Go ahead. For sure. Yeah, I've definitely. I smoked a lot of weed. I've got plenty of brain damage going on. Absolutely, but I'm not nearly as dumb as I look. I look way fucking dumber. I think you'd be great on a podcast. I think you and the beautiful thing about a podcast is, and I fucking swear to God, everybody that comes on my podcast, I. You should have a podcast. I'm like trying to give. I don't know. I don't believe. It's not that I don't believe in competitions. I don't. I have the exact opposite of a famine mentality. I think there's. There's 300 million people out there, everybody, everybody could support everybody and there's still plenty to go around. I really believe that, but obviously my bladder even kindled can't handle the podcasts at this length, so we. We've already discovered a limitation to. Well, in your defense you have a one liter smartwater and you've drank a big cup of bulletproof coffee.

Speaker 3:          02:35:55       There's a lot of liquids in there and it's also just stamina. I just like, I probably couldn't keep up with your strength and conditioning program and you can't keep up with my bladder program. My bladder is like a fucking, like a leather Satchel. Back in the old days, you can make them at a buffalo skins strong and durable. Lasts a lifetime handed down your grandchildren. You could easily do a podcast dude. And the beautiful thing about it is that no one be able to tell you what to do. You could, no one would tell you what to say, what to talk about. You wouldn't have to converse with the producers, captivate enough people to. Because I want that the access to the audience, you know, to, to influence lives, you know, would, would my words have enough meaning, um, to draw in enough people? Of course they would.

Speaker 3:          02:36:38       I hope so. They were there doing that right now if I, right now millions of people are gonna listen to this. I jump out of an airplane, you know, into the water, you know, into the ocean with a whole bunch of sharks and go swim with them. Like people are going to tune into that. But what if you get eaten? I'll start. This whole thing is fucked now, but then I get out of the water and I can talk to them. You know, there's 16 million people watched him parachute out of this plane into shark infested waters. Oh, you're out of your mind and wrote a motorcycle up onto the beach. Then I have them. But you have them already, man. You don't have to do that. Trust me. You don't have to do that. You've already done enough that you're qualified. You're qualified,

Speaker 1:          02:37:16       legit, bad ass. The idea that you're going to parachute into sharks and that's going to change. Everybody will ask. The guy's a fucking pussy. The sharks. Oh, he's got me. Let's sit down and listen to what tim has to say. I think that's just broke off there. You are so powerful. Joe Rogan, chest broke his microphone just with Ron was. I'll just hold onto it till we're done. Bear. His microphone is made from a maid in a foreign land where quality is not valued. You easily. Dude could do a podcast easily without a doubt. And I think that these, you do a lot of videos too with ranger up, right? If you call them, I call them that. What was the one we did? The Black Swan thing. That is interpretive dance. Can we. Can we show that? Yeah, that's fine. Pull it up. What's the name of that?

Speaker 1:          02:38:01       I think it's Tim Kennedy Black Swan. Pull up Tim Kennedy Black Swan. And I'll try to fix this microphone while, uh, while that's happening. But the problem you're gonna have it, was doing a television show is producers because they're going to look at you and they're going to try to put you in a mold and they're going to try to get you to do a bunch of fake shit. They do fake shit man. They fake shit. I had a problem with fake shit on my Scifi show. They faked a bunch of shit and I didn't find out about it until it was aired. And I came on the podcast and I apologized and I didn't know and it was a huge fucking problem. And that's, that was on a show called Joe Rogan questions. Everything like I'm trying to find the truth about these things and their instinct is still the fake shit and to put fake shit in that you don't know about that.

Speaker 1:          02:38:46       It's fucking horrible, very malleable. You're like, no, you're not. That's why podcasts is perfect. You do. You have a very unique vision and your unique vision is qualified by your unique life experiences. Any Hollywood douche bag is not going to understand that and they're going to try to mold you and what they think could be more profitable for the network, but they would also have to sleep at night and they'd be scared of what I could do to them once they go to bed, but they wouldn't. They live in gated communities and they hire people to keep an eye out for you. Is this it? Here? Play that and I'll fix this thing.

Speaker 5:          02:39:19       Hello and welcome to masterpiece theater is a scene from black swan performed by MMA fighter and special forces operator, Tim Kennedy.

Speaker 6:          02:39:31       I had the craziest dream last night about a boy who was turned into a swan whom falls for the wrong guy and he kills himself.

Speaker 7:          02:40:15       For the folks who are not watching this, please watch this. Go to youtube. What compelled you to do this? So the, the movie Black Swan, obviously. Well, Natalie Portman.

Speaker 2:          02:40:28       Beautiful. She is beautiful. And uh, my mom used to make us take dancing lessons. So there, as you can see, there's some skill here. This is, you just can't do this stuff. Whatever. That is scary. I'm your mom made you take dance and your dad made you take martial arts. Interesting cooking classes with my mom cooking class. Have Hunting with my dad. Um, that makes a balanced person that's like I'm Yamamoto. Musashi's book of five rings, you know, he believed that every button should, every warrior should also be well versed in poetry and calligraphy and art. Yeah. It wasn't by choice, just like, yeah, let's go to ballroom dancing and learn how to swing ballroom dance. Oh yeah. She got them all out of probably moved out. I was like 11. I didn't have a chance to find someone to take the motivation was I'm having fun.

Speaker 2:          02:41:24       You know, like you, you can't, um, if you don't enjoy and have fun in life and be able to laugh at yourself and put on like a Tutu and dance around, you know, like, like a Beautiful Fairy Butterfly Swan, both the black and white version and be able to understand what the transition the metamorphosis from the black to White Swan. It's scary, scary process. It is. Once you understand that about yourself, there's really nothing more frightening, um, that you could do in the rest of your life. If I was that guy from. What is that show inside the actors studio? Is that analogous to your transition as a fighter? I really, really try to personify that. You the Black Swan or the white swan when you fight. It's in me, it's, it's the journey to the Black Swan. I'm neither, you know, it's like the scary down the rabbit hole. Like I took the blue pill and now I'm becoming the Black Swan and there's violent, scary things on the way there and that that's, that's where I try to fight that is on the journey to the black school.

Speaker 2:          02:42:34       Is that why you come out to the rooster now? I come out to the rooster because it's bad ass song. It is a bad ass song. And roosters like the fight they do like to fight, but the songs about Vietnam, it's about Vietnam vets. The hundred and first they used to call the tail gunner or the machine gunners. The rooster on the team. Is that allison chains? Yeah. So like POW, mia, Vietnam vets, all of them. That song, the song was written by the bleaching or about his father who are disenchanted. They grew apart and he kind of resented him for being in the war and then he kind of had revelation that it was like he had to. He didn't have a choice. He drafted. So he wrote that song to, to connect, reconnect with his father who was a Vietnam vet. So that, that song has a lot of meaning to me and my community, you know, veterans. So everybody walk out of that Song, man. There's like, there's not like, I feel like there's nothing you could. You could hit me with a freight train and I wouldn't care.

Speaker 1:          02:43:37       Grab portions of my body and try to keep fighting. It's a great fucking song for you, man. There's certain songs that just sort of, you hear that song and you know, that guy's fighting like there's a country board can survive when Matt Hughes fights, you know, there's just no getting around it. Stranglehold. When Benevidez fights, Joseph Benevidez fights comes out to Ted nugent's trying to hold, which is a great fucking song for him. You know, it's just, there's certain songs that just persona fly a fighter that's a, that's a good one for you, man. I'll have it forever. That's my song. Do they give you any pressure about songs? Did they like, you have to approve it because I know I'm Uriah Faber try, you know, he always comes out to California love. But uh, he wanted to do going back to Cali and uh, they wouldn't let them do it.

Speaker 2:          02:44:25       I don't think it's like the UFC. I'm a, I'm not sure to them that they have to get rights to use that music in the production. And I have no idea how legally that that occurs. So sometimes they have a list of what you're allowed to do, you know, there are some fight promotions were like, all right, submit your, your song that you want to walk out to two weeks before and we'll see if we can, if it's approved or if we can get approval. Um, you know, it's, it's, I dunno, I have no idea how it works, but thank God I can walk out to rooster because I'd be really sad if I couldn't.

Speaker 1:          02:45:02       Yeah, it's perfect for you. Do. I'm glad that you have an exit strategy because there are a lot of fighters that don't. And the saddest thing to me is a guy who looks at fighting as everything like that is all they're capable of. That is all they're ever going to be. They don't know what to do next and they get out of it and they have this thing where they, they, they're, they're diminished. Like you could see their aura is diminished if you believe in Aras, but whoever they are like seems less when you were around them then who they were when they were competing.

Speaker 2:          02:45:37       Yeah, it's true. There's nothing more tragic than seeing the guy that blood and sweat for your entertainment and at the end of his career, you know, he wasn't smart, he didn't do things, you know, how he should have. And then at the end of his career he has nothing, you know, he's fought 20 fights, he's broken physically and mentally, you know, there there's nothing left in him and he has no resources to continue his life. You know, like I have, I've ranger up, you know, that accompany that I'm intimately part of, you know, I've great relationships with partners that are going to go outside of the. When I'm done fighting that are going to be part of whatever TV's series that I'm in, but it breaks my heart. Seeing these guys that, you know, at the end of the careers they have nothing and you're just like,

Speaker 1:          02:46:20       yeah, yeah. It breaks my heart too. And it, I've, I've seen it so many times that it just drives me fucking nuts, man. It, it, it just, it drives me nuts. I almost want to like grab them in the middle when they're peaking and go, listen man, this is beautiful, but it ain't gonna last. You've got to have something else. You got to have something that you have as much passion for as you do this. Maybe that's one area where you have an advantage in that you've been in so many life or death struggles, firefights being deployed overseas, seeing life and death and your perspective as far broader than a person who's just been an athlete, just been an athlete that is sought glory and believes that that is the end all. Be All.

Speaker 2:          02:47:06       Maybe, you know, I, I definitely have this perspective that, you know, we have, we have a shelf life as an athlete and it's short. It's this window of opportunity that if you don't capitalize on it, you know, it's common, it's gone. And um, most people don't understand that, you know, we have this, this, this window to, to earn our earning potential is small for an athlete. You know, like, I never had that. This is something that I wanted to do. I wanted to be champion. I want to be champion and that's what I'm trying to achieve in this window, not financial gain or like, like if I don't achieve it in that window, I can move on to the next thing to then achieve the next thing that I'm trying to do. But uh, these guys that go in there, they, they, the Mike Tyson is a perfect example of where, you know, he literally pissed it all away and then at the end of, you know, what happened to $230 million dollars that you had, you're bankrupt.

Speaker 1:          02:47:59       Crazy. Did he to stash away 10 can live off 10 for a long fucking time, man. Just dig tense. Blow to 20. Yeah. It's crazy when you see those stories, but it's almost like the Hubris that allows you to be a combat athlete in a lot of ways. This idea that I'm different or like your idea, you're going to fucking parachute into sharks. You're going to be fine. I'll be fine. You know, I'm not like that poor fuck. That was a triathlon training off the course of, uh, off the coast of San Diego and got bitten in half in front of his friends. That happens. Pro happens. Anybody gets in there. It's a bad world. Oceans a bad place. I don't like it at all. Sharks are beautiful. Yeah, they're beautiful when you have a delayed over a grill. Delicious as well. Um, one 70. This is the last question. Do you think that your best chance for our title would be at one 70?

Speaker 2:          02:48:54       No, I think I'm close either. Next fight. You know, who Joe Silva gives me is, you know, fits the VB Vitor Belfort, jock raise, you know that, that puts me right there. You know, I'm number six. I be number two. Three guy. That's the title fight. You know, foreign owned The you ob for? No, in the UFC. Just beating in a title. Eliminated my last two fights. Have been five rounder, main events, you know, how can you not say so am I, I'm potentially one fight away. Um, you know, Mark Munoz and move saucier fighting. Could I potentially be fighting the winner of that fight? You know, that's, that's definitely in the room too. And if that's the case then maybe I am too fights away. If I cut down to one 70, I don't think that. Let me fight for the title, you know, like I'd still be one fight away, maybe two. So no, I don't think I'd be any closer. Would, uh, physically the physicality of like me being a bigger one 70 than a lot of guys stronger than one 70. Yes, there'd be benefits there. But again, diminishing returns. Like what am I giving up for that in exchange for.

Speaker 3:          02:49:55       Do you look at the window that you have? I mean we've established that you think you have a five year window. I know you don't want to give up the number, but you did. Do you do you look at that and say, well, if I do get to a title shot at one, a five, how much time would I have left to work myself up to a title shot at one 70? Or would I regroup and try again at one 85 if I wasn't successful? The first attempt, like do you have those thoughts in your head or do you just think about next fight?

Speaker 2:          02:50:19       No def. I definitely have those thoughts in my head. I love having the five meter target. That's the super close thing that I'm looking at that I'm saying this is the goal that I'm trying to achieve. I'm trying to get a perfect group in right here, you know, that's that potential next opponent, you know, that's that guy that drank two, three, four so I can get a title eliminator type fight. But then I see the, the long road. We're like, okay, I fight, not fight. I, when I'm fighting for the title and I lose the title, can I kind of Chalcedon in it and talked my way into another title fight in a different way. Class, you know? Um,

Speaker 3:          02:50:49       Chael Sonnen is an interesting way to describe it because that's what a lot of people are doing now. Yeah. Duty when you, when you, when you, when your name has become a verb. Like, dude, he just totally got chills sewn in. Sells a master wordsmith. He really is. You did a great fucking job chels sending it with this Michael bisping fight though. Both of you did. I mean it, it got interesting and I was very happy that you guys sort of sorted it out inside the octagon and you both gave each other a lot of respect. But God damn, there was a lot going back and forth between you two. Yeah. We're like, we're never going to be friends. No. But when you like when you hit, I hit him so hard. So like I, I,

Speaker 2:          02:51:27       it had the same performance that in, in strikes landed in percentage that Jon Jones to texture it did as I did to car

Speaker 3:          02:51:34       being like, that's I hit that guy that many times. You have blasted him with some hard shots. He took them, he took them, you know, like I know how hard I hit. I put guys down to the gym with way less and I'm wearing four ounce gloves and Michael Bisping was like, Hey, I'm here for 25 minutes. You're not going to put me away as like, how can you not respect a guy for that? Now he's, uh, he's definitely a tough dude. He's very, very determined. He's a, he's also a, you've got to give it up for them, for mental toughness. Just not even considering retiring. The fact he's fucked his eye up to eye surgeries. Not even, it was just, it's just a thing I'm going to pull aside, get back into the gym who will come and striking, you know, he's, he's tough as they come.

Speaker 3:          02:52:15       He's a born fighter. I mean, really, that's what he's supposed to be doing. Is he the personification of our nightmare of two, three fights, let's say, loses two more fights. That is the end of his career. Um, you know, he, his, he's, he, his eyes going to be permanently damaged to the rest of his life, you know, like how much brain damage does he had and how many fights and how many sparring preparations for or fight has he had. Now he's done and he's out of the limelight and he's broken, you know, does he have, was he smart enough to prepare for that? I think he was, but you know, he, he is that example of, you know, key left everything in the cage and time and time again at 24 minutes. So the fifth round, that dude was still trying to get up for me.

Speaker 3:          02:52:54       You know, like when the, when the, when the 32nd call was from our corners, he's like started coming right at me after I just dominated him for 24 and a half minutes. Yeah. He wasn't given. I'm still trying to win that fight. What a great. He's a tough dude. No doubt about it. He's got some serious problems. He's got a real injury to his neck. Affecting is a strength of his arm. You know, he's a, he's a, he's as tough as they come. You know, he's definitely as tough as they come, but I know what you're saying as far as guys that accumulate injuries and then they get to a certain point in time like what is left. You know, there's a lot of guys that have done less far, far less, you know, less successful than him that their bodies have given out along the way.

Speaker 3:          02:53:36       It's a fucking hurt game, so the game and the hurt game is along the way. Just the amount of accumulation of damage that you get in training. Forget about. That's what most casual fans just have no idea. You see little cuts, a little bit of blood, a little bit of sweat and the fight, that's nothing, you know, like leading up to my 25 minute fight with Michael Bisping like my sparring partners were like Bubbleq Danielle and Carlos condit when they're are peaking for their fights and then they moved on and then I had John Jones, myself, like this room full of dudes that are the best in the world and if we're sparring two times a week for seven, six, seven, eight weeks, you know, like leading up to that fight, you know, and like we're hitting each other just as hard there as we are in the cage, you know, because you have to put, push yourself as far as you can in training so that the best element of who you are, what you are occurs in the cage, what do you, how do you feel about that?

Speaker 3:          02:54:34       Like as far as like sparring hard, do you think that you have to spar as hard as you fight or do you think that there's a way? Like Robbie lawler famously said that he doesn't really spar much as sitting. Yeah. He said he knows how to fight. He said it's just about getting in shape and working on his technique and I'm a little ice bar way less than I used to. You know, like I, I'm, and on very rare occasions do I really go all out. But I think there are there times in a fight

Speaker 2:          02:55:04       camp where both your coaches need to see you and you need to see yourself when you're, when you're trying to do it all. You know, when, when, when you're broken, when you're hurt, when you're tired, you know, and sometimes the only way to get there is to push yourself to the limit and they only put way to get there is man by going after it.

Speaker 1:          02:55:23       And so you have to feel what it's like to be inside that, that, that, that position to be inside that, that, that position where you're just duking it out at 100 percent. There's no holding back. You know what it's like to be exhausted. You know what it's like to be strong, you know what it's like to be hurt, you know what it's like to bounce back from being dominated in a, in a training session. Like there's no substitution for that actual fight.

Speaker 2:          02:55:51       No, no. In grappling. Like do I ever am I in a position for, you know, a guy for me to work on an escape of an bar, you know, there's a thousand ways I could have prevented ever getting there. But I still have to see what it's like to get out of it. And the only way I'll ever see what it's like to get out of it is a film actually put in it. So it's the same in fighting like, um, when I, when I thought I had really hurt my hand in, in, uh, in the first round and I sit down and I come out the second round, I just tanked, you know, like pain, adrenaline dumps against, against Mike, you know, I come back to the court at the end of second round and they're like, all right, so you're gonna lose this fight if you do that. I was at the pits, you know, like my hands hurt. I wasn't sure if I could throw my right hand again. Um, but you through it? Yeah. What was wrong with it? A broken. It was broken, but it's okay. Now I have, I have the brakes in the car that I'm supposed to be wearing. I'm just embarrassed. What's broken on it? The metacarpal and this, uh, this, this right here. How bad is it? Broken through just a hairline fracture. They said six weeks in a cast. And I was like, I can't handle a cast.

Speaker 1:          02:57:00       Me Sprays. Just jumping the fucking ocean. Have the sharks take care of it. Yeah, dude, you're crazy man. But that's why you do what you do. Yeah.
