Speaker 1:          00:00          What was the general good experience? Will there's diversion, highlight knockouts, one of the most ridiculous nightmare of all time. When you stand there with your hands down, step forward and it's like he was a comic book scene. It's like the way you knocked him out. Like I said about you being a bad guy in a movie. It seemed like you were a bad guy in a boxing movie, but it didn't make any sense. You were the guy. Like if I was say if there's someone was I was a coach of a good guy and I was sitting ringside and I was watching you do that, we'd be like, Shit, okay. I'm tell you. Stood over them like that. I was outside of my body. I could see me and him standing there like I was a third person.

Speaker 1:          00:39          I can't explain it, you know? And then when I started throwing the punches, like I went back into my body and start welding on the little whatever, I can't. I can't explain that feeling so many different things that happened. That was a big one too because I got shared so much online. Millions and millions of people saw that online. They're like, what in the fuck is this guy got in his head and that's when they started. Who is this guy? While we haven't heard about this before? It's like everybody's waking up to the heavyweight division. All of sudden it was so true and it was the perfect convert. There it is. I did play it from the beginning. Jamie. Here it goes. Come on. Straight box skills. I, I got boxing skills. You know, when the first photo I showed it, I stayed disciplined. I didn't abandoned the game plan, you know, and I show people that I could box.

Speaker 1:          01:31          Yeah. And he knows probably the only time I just really just stay super disciplined. Not despite, but this first one, this part, right? This one right here. I went outside of my body right here. I'm standing. Then I came back. I kid you not. I don't know what the hell was going on with me. That was ridiculous. It was ridiculous. He said, no he didn't. Yeah, he was, uh, he was quite upset that the strangest little concoction. He's got dreadlocks. They're little like tape. Yeah, that seems like that would get in the way to keep it up. You know, the Asians believe in it too. That was, that was sweet too. Then the referee gave me, I don't know, it would have been funnier. The railroad let go when he wrote to the other corner, talk about a movie that would have been. But you know, that fight right there was the real start of it all, you know, in terms of public perception.

Speaker 1:          02:24          Exactly, exactly. I knew I was really going somewhere with that, especially when it went viral and then coming back with Ortiz made it cause people would have made it that much more interesting to see what I'm going to do now because people tune in now whether they they love me or hate me, they tuned into seeking. I'm not next personnel. Yeah. No. At this point in time, trt bell TRT Vito Belfort forever. That was when he was on trt. He was a different kind of human being. He was just completely different than he is in every circumstance. Oh yeah. Looking back, you can

Speaker 2:          02:59          see that. I mean, because when I fought him, I fought him on trt. You found him when he was at though the super victorious. Absolutely. Looked like fucking the incredible hulk, but muscles on his fucking eyebrows. Yeah. Looking back you can see that, you know, but at the time as a fighter you got to be. You can't think like that, you know what I mean? What are they looking at it? That doesn't even do it just doesn't do it justice that's supposed to be before and after. And I'm just recovering from a cold or the week. I'm a little congested so I keep coughing. The real, the real key. It's a better one. That's better. That's way better. That's much more accurate. And he's

Speaker 1:          03:37          the guy who was known to take things, took things early in his career. Remember when he fought randy when he was 19, he was 240 pounds.

Speaker 2:          03:44          Yeah, exactly his next start at the top of his head. But um, yeah, I remember there was a picture of us both on the scale in Brazil and you know, looking back now years, Holy Shit, you know, anyone else with the guys kinda big blah blah blah blah blah, but you don't think like that the time you can't as a fight, if you start having those thoughts, those doubts start looking at fight his physique and thinking, oh, he looks good. You've already lost, you know. But in hindsight, you can look back and say, holy fuck, what was I thinking? You know, this guy's fucking body out of his mind. I remember on there, I was trying to get a rise out of him and he kept putting his hand in my face. I'm not a religious guy and you know, God bless anyone that is, you know, I mean that I respect everyone's opinions, but I'm not in as we know, veto is heavily religious. And he kept sticking this thing in my face. He was pissing me off. Come here, come here. And he leans in. I said, there is no Jesus made. Maybe there is, maybe there isn't, you know, me getting a job with a head kick in the second round, but maybe that was God the watting may who knows? What did he say? Some fucking project is bullshit.

Speaker 1:          04:57          So the drug actually prolongs were intensifies the depression, you know, maybe. Okay. For very short term use of very severe depression, but these are not things you want to go on and stay on for a length of time. What's fascinating to me is when I talk to people that are on them that want to talk to you, like they're on some cancer medication or they're on something that cures polio, like they, they make it seem like you're insensitive to the possibility that there's other solutions. Right. And there were many other solutions. We have really good evidence for the antidepressant effect of physical activity. Yes. Both to prevent and treat. We have very good evidence for supplemental fish oil or omega three fatty acids to permit and CBDS. Well and the microbiome looks like it's involved in our mental states as well. So, you know, there's so many different ways.

Speaker 1:          05:47          Yes, CBD for sure. So again, gets back to inflammation it and it gets back to in an integrative approach and not just relying on a single thing like a pharmaceutical treatment. Yeah, I've talked to intelligent people that are on Ssri in one form or another and even ones that have struggled were on one for a while and then it stopped working and then they tried another one and they're combining ones and they're on this weird sort of chemical rollercoaster and they reject any possible notion that there's other alternatives. Especially when you bring up the exercise one, right? I bring up the exercise one, they go, oh, this fucking meathead exercise. We just stop and I'm like, I'm telling you. We did this thing with my friends called sober October and what we did is we no alcohol, no anything for the month of October, but also we did this fitness challenge and we got really carried away and we're all competing against each other with this heart rate app.

Speaker 1:          06:38          So we're working out three hours, four hours a day. It was crazy. But what was interesting about it to me was not just that your body sort of adapts when you force it to work that many hours, but that your mood is phenomenal. I felt so good. Yeah. And I was telling everybody, if you could take what I like, I don't feel that good right now. I mean I felt great, but I don't feel as good as I did during October because I was working out four hours a day. It was. If you could get that in pill form, you would take it every day if there was no side effects because it literally removed anxiety. All the internal chatter, all the negative chatter, it was gone. Everything seemed amazing. True. And there are side effects of physical activity are great. You know, it revs up immune function, improves the gesture and sleep, all that you mentioned, the anxiety, the by far and away, the most effective treatment I found for anxiety is simple.

Speaker 1:          07:31          A simple breathing technique, regulating the breath. I've seen this work for the most extreme forms of panic disorder and the drugs that we use for anxiety or the worst. The benzodiazepines are highly addictive. Mess with your mind. Yeah. I have a good friend who has an issue with anxiety medication and he takes it all the time and when he does take it, apparently it has that rebound effect exactly right. He gets horribly anxious. Well, these are handed out like candy and nobody warns people how addictive they are. Worse addiction than an opiate. Addiction. Xanax really? Well. I did not know that. Harder to get off of the opioids. Wow. Because out of all those voices, as long as you're not personally trying to figure it out and filter it yourself with your own, which is completely impossible, but if you could just look at it objectively from afar, this is going to work itself out in a far better way than has ever happened before. In our past. There's never been this many voices and our pastor has been like you were talking about a select few voices. The Walter cronkite's, the whoever it is at the top, and then everyone else sort of had to wait for the narrative to be spelled out for them. That's not the case anymore. That's right. And, and again, I think it's the best of times in the worst of times, the best of times because all these new voices are bringing all sorts of great perspective and insight and intelligence to the story that wasn't there before.

Speaker 3:          08:56          And that's great. The problem is, is if the infrastructure that used to be there to kind of bring us all Paul bring us all up to kind of basic level so that we understood the facts disappears so they, we don't have anything that kind of makes it so that we all understand what's at issue and what's at stake and what the facts are so that we can act as a democracy in a sensible way. Then the question is how do we run a democracy? You know, because if we could have all these different, you know, I like to think about the difference between the culture channel and the democracy channels. So in the culture channel, this is the best of times by orders of magnitude and the stuff on television today is a billion times better than anything from the 19 seventies in 19 eighties. Yeah. And it's, that's a product of this incredible competition and the fact that you can have anything and any niche market and as long as it's enough, it makes sense to do it and that's what's great.

Speaker 3:          09:50          But when you turn to the democracy channel, the same fragmentation, the same niche market, the same reality of us all living in these different universes means we can't address problems as a democracy with even the same facts. And that's a real problem because if we all live in our own fact universe, but we have to same face, the same real problems in the same real earth, then we're not going to decide them in any sensible way. And how you solve that problem is really hard. Like we're not going back. Thank God we're not going back to the 19 sixties. It's just not going to be the case that there are three channels we get to watch. That's just not gonna happen. Um, and, and it's a great thing because we've got all this amazing culture, but what do we do on the democracy side? How do we build a democracy, recognizing that everybody's not going to spend all their time geeking out about campaign finance reform legislation. I. And that's why I think we need to think about these other ways to bring people to some sensible understanding.
