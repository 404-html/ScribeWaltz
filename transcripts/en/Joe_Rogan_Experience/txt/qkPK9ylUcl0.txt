Speaker 1:          00:00          Hello Freak bitches, but I feel a lot better at doing this. I'm going to do to Kilimanjaro by the way, on a bad foot. Oh yeah man. And a challenge. I have a friend of mine who went to Bolivia. He filmed a. He has a television show called mediator. His name's Steven Rinella. He's a professional hunter and he went to Bolivia and he lived with the Toumani for a couple of weeks and he brought them shoes like, hey, you know, hey, try these shoes on that. They didn't want to have nothing to do with those shoes, like stupid things out of here because those people walk barefoot everywhere and their feet. He said their feet don't look at anybody's feet. He's like, they're all splayed out like their toes are splayed out and there's like a thick, thick padding underneath where they're basically have their own shoes, like the calluses and the bottom of their feet act as shoes.

Speaker 1:          00:50          That doesn't sound too attractive for me to, to have to attract abby, to have feet like a heart and know what I do is using my mind. So you don't want to have like callouses on the bottom of your feet. I got very soft baby feet. So you really. Yeah, yeah, yeah. My wife always does a self defeating man, man. So you are going to do this barefoot. Are you going to wear shoes at least? No, no, no, no. Nothing like that exists to go once again, mind over matter. Well, what about frostbite at? I did the half marathon, barefoot. You did beyond the polar circle at temperatures even far more below than the, of my joy. Is it? Do you think that's possible? There's any benefit from the fact that you're walking so much or running and then your body is heating up and maybe that has a positive effect on your skin?

Speaker 1:          01:54          Um, the thing is I'm very able to, uh, to go way to tap into the hormonal system creating a adrenaline. You know, this fact where people are sometimes refer to, they lift up and mother because the child is underneath that actually is the mind staring directly into the reptilian mode. That reptilian brain, which is the primitive brain and that you have direct access to pure adrenaline, makes you able to do almost inconceivable feet and accomplish it only any to write trigger. Now because I have been so much into the cold, cold is cold. Is there a real force impact upon you? So you need to learn how to connect within with your mind and you breathing into the brainstem, into this adrenaline to withstand this force. The cold impact. I've learned it. So you're tapping in your brain, you're causing your body to produce more adrenaline and you're focusing on the areas of your body that are contacting the snow, like you're focusing on the bottom of your feet.

Speaker 1:          03:07          Yes, yes. And it works. You know, I'm still able to look around how nice their sunset or the sunrise and and be. So there is a margin even there, right? We just need to go back to belief and belief there in means the neurotransmitters and the neurons. Those have sick notes and say churches. So if you charge your, your buddy, then if you're able to influence up to DNA level, and we have proven this already, but the aisle six, enter, locating those, uh, connected to safe inflammation, we could not find it off. We could not suppress the side against the flammatory markers. And we showed very effectively not me, only a whole group of persons which are trained just in four days to be able to go into the DNA and create the right chemistry consciously by breathing and using the mind to fend off flammatory markers a cost by say a bacteria inside. So we are actually able to tap into the deepest of ours, create, have control over adrenaline's trestle and go up to not only in the deepest part of the brain, but also in the DNA.
