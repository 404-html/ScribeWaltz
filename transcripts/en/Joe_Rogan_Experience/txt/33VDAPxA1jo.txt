Speaker 1:          00:00:01       So glad you're here, man. Thank you Rebecca. Please fucking pumped. The Joe Rogan experience podcast is brought to you by the fleshlight. If you go to Joe Rogan.net and click on the link for the flashlight and enter in the code named Rogan, you will save yourself 15 percent. How's that time? I read a good deal. I have a flashlight on me right now. Do you? Did he have one yesterday? Have a flow state that leads me to where I keep my flashlight to a little case in my house. I'll give you one little bit. Leave. I don't need it, but I've got plenty of. Hey, I'm making a good living. Expensive. Thank you. And I'm not shy. You're not a shy guy. If you wanted one you would just buy it. No, no. Joe was using that earlier. No one used that. We wouldn't do that to.

Speaker 1:          00:00:45       He's done that to other people. I would not allow him to do that. Sure. Come on dog. You know, I love you mom. I love you. Like I love air. The, uh, we're also brought to you by onnit.com. Makers of Alpha brain, the nootropic supplement, if you're interested in any of this stuff, I suggest to you a checking out our website, a on it o n n I t.com, and be just google nootropics and read all the pros and cons on. Don't just go out there and buy something, but if you're interested in our stuff, it's a full spectrum neutral. It's all balanced out and explained online and as much technical and scientific details we can. We're actually funding studies on this right now and we're hoping that it was going to be done at Boston University's, uh, if it's not, the other option I think was university of Australia, one of the universities in Australia that doesn't work.

Speaker 1:          00:01:35       Columbus state to find some closure option. We're going to Australia find some Komodo island dudes that are selling certificates. Um, it's, uh, we have 100 percent money back guarantee. This is the most important thing, but when you go through the do anything, the money back, it's not worth it. Some people, it is. First of all, what does the supplement do for you? The supplement is a cognitive enhancing supplement. Don, my rarer, it makes your mind function a little bit better, a little neuro cup of coffee if you what we're just talking about. I forgot the to Rita. That's not what we're talking about. We're talking about vitamins. You dirty bitch vitamins and discounts and the fact that you could send it back and you get 100 percent of your money back. Can you take 100 percent? Can you drink with them? Oh yeah, it's a vitamin.

Speaker 1:          00:02:22       I just always ask a doctor whenever it gives me something. There are certain nutrients that they've discovered, you know, that help Alzheimer's patients are nutrients that help people after they've had some head trauma. That was what a Roman ascii stuff was based on. I know you're a big football fan, Bill Roman ask. He has his own very similar line of this kind of stuff. He's got something called neuro one, which I also like and maybe some people might like even better than Alpha brain because it's a drink and you'll like it. You could just mix it up like some people don't like swallowing pills. I don't give a fuck. I take two Alpha brains and I'm straight. I like it. You like it up? Yeah, just for lips. Just for giggles and were just first story, like Shit's bad than the good surprises. I never did this positive, but you know what?

Speaker 1:          00:03:03       I met Romanowski in Denver with the Broncos retraining and Haley Colorado and they told me I wanted to interview him. I said the show called off. So it was essentially. Yeah, I remember that. And they said you don't want an interview with bill. And I said, no, I do. So we got to lunch. The whole place is filled. There's a table for eight. It's empty with just him sitting there. It's not crazy because nobody wanted to eat lunch with them. Wow. I've talked to him subsequently saying, sounds cool man. The dude had a ton of concussions. Yeah, a ton of concussions. And that was the reason why he created this neuro Juana. I watched a whole interview with him about it. Fascinating stuff. You know, the guy realized that he was having problems and he tried to counteract that with nutrients. And so that's uh, I was taught this by a first exposed to his stuff by no name from a member of Sara and no name on it.

Speaker 1:          00:03:54       Yeah, he did. I did two for Wella. It's just a joke. He did. Yeah, he did. San Fran did it for a job. Who's pis? I drank my own. I wasn't going to drink anybody else. I'll let may. Maybe a dominatrix now. How dare you. Dumb you dirty boy last night. Anyway, check out just a free plug for Mr. Roman [inaudible]. I enjoyed his stuff. Check out neuro one. If you want to check out our stuff, go to [inaudible] dot com. We have one in it, not just Alpha brain, which is something that I use everyday. And again, as I said, it's 100 percent money back guarantee on the first order. You don't have to 30 pills, can't like get a big giant bottle. And then the Newbie, but 30 pills, the first 30 pill bottle, it's, we want to make sure that no one feels ripped off. Does I use this stuff?

Speaker 1:          00:04:40       I've used this stuff way before I was, uh, you know, uh, associated with on it. I believe nootropics are a, an effective way to give yourself a little mental edge. And I also believe in regular vitamins. I tell people I drink a kale shakes. I tried to do it every single day. It's big, crazy mixture of Greens. I take all sorts of vitamins. I say take all sorts of antioxidants. I try to drink as much Kombucha as I can. I take as Adopolis. I take a lot of like healthy live cultures and I absolutely know for a fact by my own personal experience that that's enhanced my life. Was the guy that just had an astronomy sandwich can put that shit away. I put that shit away. You know why? Because I'm going to do kettle bells two hours. What's a head toothpaste that's. I have these giant iron cannonballs that swing around.

Speaker 1:          00:05:28       I got to show it to you. You'll love it. So craziest exercise ever is this Russian strength training where you, you're, you're swinging around these fucking giant cannon balls. So every movement is a compound movement that requires your whole body to work as one unit. So it transfers very well athletically. Look, did you Jitsu or to football or even about, you know, you're a good basketball player. It would transfer even at that. If it's kettlebells, like one of the best exercises I've ever used ever. So fucking it's the. It's a great way to work out. It's brutal and you can get done in 20 minutes. You can just blow it out in 20 minutes and then you're fucking wrecked for two days. It's amazing. It's so good. It's such a good exercise. I was hoping maybe we just shoot a little pool buddy. We're going to do that for sure.

Speaker 1:          00:06:14       Anyway, back to the commercial on a.com. Go check out Alpha brain checkout. There's a shroom tech sport which is a a quarter steps mushroom, be 12 and a bunch of other stuff in their supplement for endurance, which cordyceps mushroom is. It's actually a nutrient that people started eating at high altitudes and help them deal with the lack of oxygen and they believed that it helps in difference and especially when combined with be 12 people love it. A lot of Jujitsu guys love the shroom tech sport. I get that all the time and shroom tech immune is another one that's also a mushroom based supplement that actually enhances your immune system. So fascinating concept. The way it works, being that it tricks your body into thinking. It's like cold, so your body fires up a domain system for a fight that never takes place. Coca leaves before I go into the Hollywood hills.

Speaker 1:          00:07:04       It's a good move because of the altitude. You get those, you know go. Yeah, I know some. Some Bolivians can't grow. That shit here is. Can you grow it here? If you have a greenhouse at work and grow anything. Why the fuck? Why don't they have greenhouse? They. I never saw green here. Why's everybody grown? Coke in the third world. When you just get a nice greenhouse. Yeah. Is it like undercover? My blowing up their spot right now. I probably shouldn't be talking about this on a.com. Oh, and it go check out all the shit. New Moods, a five htp, tryptophan enhancing. I'll supplement and entering the code named Rogan and you will get 10 percent off all your orders and remember always the first order of 30 pills. If you don't like everything, it's bullshit. It's not for you. Whatever. Whatever you feel you can get 100 percent of your money back. You don't even have to return the product. We're way more concerned with people not feeling ripped off than we are with making money. All right. I have a question. Try to keep it on the level of their show with this commercial. This is over commercials over and then we go on for like two hours just talking. Shit. Ready? Why don't we have lunch together? Talked about everything.

Speaker 1:          00:08:10       What are you doing, Brian? Nothing. What happened? You slipped. You. Are you a Dj now? I am in now. You've been hanging out with Russell Peters. I have been. All right. Give Gimme some doctors. Scratch Gimme something. We've got to have Nick Diaz. Yeah. I don't think you should do that anymore. I don't think that's. I don't like that. I don't like that. I want to hear Nick Diaz voice and Nick Diaz is one of the fighters in the UFC guy. Really the coolest thing ever. He want to fight. Then after the fight he goes, train by day Joe Rogan podcast by night. Greatest moment of my program experience

Speaker 2:          00:09:02       Joe Rogan podcast.

Speaker 1:          00:09:09       This guy likes fucking around with the speeds of things. Let's go get some technological age going on. Welcome to the show and thank you. So happy to have you here. Dominant a railroad just before, just to all you folks out there in the cyber world is a guy that I actually paid to see before I got into comedy. I was a huge fan and uh, I, I just, I love standup comedy. I loved watching evening at the Improv and I took a date to the, uh, to Nick's comedy stop and Boston to watch dahmer. I think maybe I had done an open mic like maybe once, maybe I might not have even. It might've even been before, but I remember I watched there and one of the things you, you, uh, first of all, you, you were, you fucking killed and you were one of the few guys that could survive that crazy Boston gauntlet that they used to throw it on the national head, but they liked me and so everybody loved you.

Speaker 1:          00:10:08       But it was a, it was a tricky situation that Boston gauntlet taste through. It would take a guy like billy crystal would come into town, right? And they would make billy crystal. They would purposely put up the best local guys. Steve Sweeney, Don Gavin, Kenny, Kenny, everybody would go up with 15 minutes. I'll fucking fury to short sets and you're supposed to do 50 at the end and then, you know, at the end. But first of all, they've made everyone laugh with every local reference humanly possible. And if there's anything people love in Boston, it's a Boston joke. It's a problem. I had like my first 20 minutes all revolved around Boston because when you're, when you're fucking sinking out there and you're looking for some, you know that you could make fun of a girl from revere. She has big hair. That's right there. It's in my. It's in my wheelhouse.

Speaker 1:          00:10:57       I can pull that out. You know, you could always go with like local Charleston, the Irish girls and all that. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. There was. There's always something like, well, and then you're in Japan after dark Spanish. Yeah. You could. You could do like local jokes and you survived. You survived. You're one of the few guys. I saw a lot of guys eat up fat bag of dicks. I heard Richard Lewis hid under the stage afterwards. Oh, I heard. He said, well, I've heard that a few times with that guy. He's apparently, if he doesn't get like his crowd, like he has a very specific crowd that like comes up to see them and sometimes you know, people maybe don't know what he's going to do before he does it. If they do, they love it. They love that character. But if they don't, I think from what I've heard, it can go bad. I can imagine. Remember Nick's, Nick's was the place where you saw me and that was really a tough club and especially the third show in Friday night. So I asked Jonathan Katz due to show with me, you know, how Jonathan

Speaker 3:          00:11:54       is very nebbishy and little Jewish comedian versus a hosted my first open. Like, what was he? Yeah, it was nice. Theoretical, right? Yeah. And he, uh, I said John did a show at me. He goes, I can't, I can't go in there. I said, come on, I'll protect you. You know, watch your back. She goes up. They actually started heckling the back of his bald head before he got to the stage for nothing. He didn't say anything. He goes up, it goes a precisely, just walks off the stage. They booed him before he talked. I love the. Boston was an interesting mix of college educated people and savages. Yeah. It's, uh, it is one of the, it has, I think has the highest amount of colleges per capita in the country. And I couldn't get in any of them in our. I used to see street fights there when, when you didn't see them anymore, you see guys, they didn't go home and work at a tie white shirt hanging out.

Speaker 3:          00:12:48       Oh yeah. Battling each other. There's still fights in Boston. Boston dudes will still fight. It's one of the few places where you're probably not going to get shot. No, I actually want to duke it out with Mike. Get stomped. Well, you could get shot though. Everyone has baseball bats, but no one plays bass with the wrong kids from south that you could get shot. Anybody get shot there too. But you do definitely see like more fistfights there. Yeah. I always think of you as in New York while I was born in Jersey. But uh, I mean I got better in New York when I was in, but I developed in Boston, but I was only there for four years doing stand up, you know, I moved to New York only four years into my act was. And I got a manager so that my manager, who's still my manager, so state it was selling me as a headliner, but I wasn't really a headliner yet.

Speaker 3:          00:13:38       You didn't have the minutes. You probably had the talent. But I had a good solid 15 to 40 if the ground was right. Remember the first time this guy, Hiram cast and crew, I remember that guy got me a Gig for a $75. I had to do 45 minutes. I said I only have 25. He goes like, you know, like Jesus with the fishes that goes, go out there and do it. It will come. It will come unto thee. And I don't know if it came you crowd work because I didn't have the time. Oh yeah. Those are silly days. I couldn't believe people can do 20 minutes. When I had five minutes, I got up 20 minutes in a row. They don't. What's the longest flat out set of? Just stand up you've ever done? I'm not a real good at real long. I probably an hour and a half.

Speaker 3:          00:14:25       That's about all you should do, right? I think I love a 45 minutes set crusher. Right. Just get off one them wanting more instead of. Yeah, I've done long. I've done too long. I used to do these q and a's at the end of my shows. Yeah, but that's different. I thought that goes into some. Nan was getting to sample, used to do the people were falling asleep or bored. They get bored or girlfriends are like, yeah, you know, it's. You can only taught nobody. I don't care who are. Maybe it was Charlie Murphy that said this. It might've been. Oh No. His job did Charlie Murphy quota before I quote him all the time. Get to know Charlie Murphy. He's a deep dude because he really. I don't know. He said deep dude. He says some pretty interesting shit. He's a great storyteller too. He's a good guy around Charlie.

Speaker 3:          00:15:11       You would like Charlie Murphy. Dom. You would like. Oh, I'm sure. Yeah. It's always weird for those guys whose brothers like Tony Rock, Chris Rock's brother Tony Rockets. Fuck, he's great. Yeah, he's fucking funny, man. I hadn't seen him in years and uh, I saw him at the Improv and I had to go up to them afterwards. I got, dude, I haven't seen you in like a long time. Like I go, God damn. You got good man. Winton is it that makes you laugh? Yeah. Just some goofy in front of you with smart, friendly on stage too, like fun on stage. Like you want to hang out with them. I just want to have fun with them. You know, when you get to see a guys enjoying themselves up there, it really makes you see when a guy's not anymore. It's one of the saddest things about our business.

Speaker 3:          00:15:53       When you see a guy who's just doesn't even realize what he's got the greatest job of all time. I know the other night I was late for work and I work 15 minutes and it was at 10:00 at night. I was taking a nap. I was fucking late for work and I'm such a hamper. Fag that I was in the bathtub. I'm so lazy. I was shaving. I was took a bath so I didn't have to stand in shape, but it's almost like they're calling me on the, on the cell phone thinking I wasn't showing. And you're right around the corner.

Speaker 3:          00:16:32       Oh, that's a real comic. There's something about Comedians stripper time, but I love it. You know, it's like people need help. People try and make it miserable, but it's got to be tough. Huh? Ain't tough compared to like work in a coma, but going on the road, I'd hate to be on the road all the time on going. Nobody's asking you. Nobody's ask Yo, hey, I hate to fly to Australia. Nobody wants you in Australia. What are you going to do when you get there? You know what I mean? Like people ever get people to try and make your life miserable. Trying to like maybe make themselves feel better about themselves. Yeah, there's definitely people that was trying to justify why they're happier than you and find the holes in your game. But as a professional comedian, as long as you stay funny and the only way to stay funny, you just keep doing what you're doing.

Speaker 3:          00:17:21       You'll never become a crazy person. Keep reading shit, keep writing, shed. Keep watching things. Keep coming up with new jokes. You're always going to keep doing it. Yeah, but I mean I see guys like my age are so bitter. Bitter. You fucking got away with life. Being a comedian. I though, you know, it's like I love it. I want to get better. Well you're a, you're a real comic. Felt dumb. You've always been a real comic. Like the. As long as I've known you, you know, like I said, I paid to see you before I ever even did it.

Speaker 4:          00:17:49       Really. You've always been a just like that's what you are. You're not like a guy who is trying to get a series and if you got that series in, you'd abandoned stand up or a guy to be able to. You always just domino, rarer professional comedian from television. Even introduce yourself like that. Television doing well. You know like I was wanting to Suzanne somers show when I came out here and I really liked her. The show is really bad. It's called cheese to sheriff. She used to share. Oh No. Beautiful Blonde with big tits and she's a sure that you get that Gig and uh, at the end of the night they'd always want to go out. I go, I gotta go to the comedy store and they go, well, why you already have a job? I don't know. That's my job. This is my side job, you know what I mean?

Speaker 4:          00:18:35       Being in the building of the Sitcom was my side job, my real job is being a standup like, and that's the way I take it. Like even anytime I got series or anything else and I love acting, I love working with people, but I lost the standups. My favorite. It's the most fun thing ever. We used to talk about it after when I was doing a news radio, you know, I'd come back to the store and you'd be like, yeah, there's nothing. Doesn't matter what you're doing. I still want to go up there and kill. I remember we talked about it because I remember because you were getting the series because I always practiced stand up. Oh yeah, Daniel Tosh that because he's on top with the comedy central thing. But he practiced the standups and wouldn't you know what happens when you get fired from a series?

Speaker 4:          00:19:11       We still got our job. Right? How cool is that? Yeah. The last thing you want to do. I don't like being dependent on anything. That's why I was so nice not having a boss. Yeah. Well the best boss I've ever had for sure is the USA because they're there. They couldn't be better people to work for. I mean, my eyes. I've never had it. I've never seen you so happy. I love it. Has Been. You're so good at that. You're so fucking sharp and, and like you make it. Like I was telling you, you break it down, you know, you make me understand the fighting more while I try to explain it is if like you're smart friend is over that hasn't seen fighting, but exactly. I want to make it exciting for him. I want. And I'm talking you through how I'm looking at it.

Speaker 4:          00:19:48       I'm looking at his path. So I'm like, this guy's got this path. He's got to secure. That arm has got to get his hand connected. You know? And when you bring people in like that, you, you're, you're with, you're in is my mind. I mean that's what's going on in my head when I'm watching the fight. Go Watch them out. Needed a stomach. There's something always got full mouth. Oh, I see it coming. You know, I see like these paths and I want to just guide people through the path. It's, it's, it's, it's the most non job job I've ever had. Oh, I can see it. I can look like you're just floating through it. I love it. The thing I realized about myself was that I loved violence, but it has to be real. Like I don't like violent movies. Did it, did it.

Speaker 4:          00:20:23       Did to see Joey peshy a 60 year old guy beating up some 20 year old kid. What the fuck? No fucking bullshit. I was there that night when you invited me to the pump. These guys really getting fucking whacked and, and you know, you know, when it really hits, the reality is when you sit. And like I told you, I was sitting behind the guy's mother and girlfriend when he got knocked out. And the mother's like, chew me, you know, like real fun. I love the pounding they take. Yeah. It's odd that you remember the kid, the Tasmanian devil is just ran up the thing and did like flips over or do you remember him talking about? It was Kinda, it maybe he was like maybe Mulatto or maybe from an island or something. He's kind of a light skin black kid and he was phenomenal.

Speaker 4:          00:21:05       He was, he was, he was leaping in the air like eight feet. And I'm talking about jealousy. I do. I can't believe I don't have his name on the top of. Hold on. Whoa. But he was, it was like they spread the camera up when you were watching him. He was a, he was the one that knocked the guy out. Yeah. I have to. I have to find out what his name is right now because he's fucking brilliant. And he's an up and coming kid. So just give me a. So while we're waiting, let's talk more about supplements. Hey Don. What was it like meeting Johnny Carson was. Do you have any stories of anything cool that, that, that happened and the thing about it is that was like in 1986, so that's when the tonight show is still really big and it was not fun.

Speaker 4:          00:21:47       It was a, it was an experience. It was like a, um, an imprimatur of comedy. It was an experience. John John Shits, sorry, keep calling shiny shit. Uh, but Carson, I wanted, I looked in the hills and burbank and I wonder to run away, I wanted to run away and start a new life like in the hills because I was so fucking afraid of getting on that stage when they. Because Jim Mccauley, the guide book that comes and talks to you and then they pull it back in. There it is. John Dodson, sorry, what's his name? John Dotson. That was the kid. Yeah, he's amazing. He's an athlete. He, he moves like a cartoon. Flies through the air. Yeah. It's just super talented. He was doing that flip. He was like running up the walls. Yeah. He's incredible. He's incredible. He's. Yeah, he does like cartoon is shit. It's like so, like, so gifted.

Speaker 4:          00:22:36       You know, he's just got like a, almost like an acrobatic ability, whatever you're saying, you were terrified. Just terrified to go on the stage. Show is there, the curtain go back and it's unreal that you hear Johnny Carson laughing and Ed Mcmahon a little and see I had done a joke but that man and when, when I saw him backstage, he pulled me towards him. I think I'll fucking head's going to slide me right before I go on because he and I actually, I didn't know that he loved the joke, but you remember the joke? Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. It was like, um, you call them our, what do I call? I said I met Ed Mcmahon. He's, you know, he's been in show business for 35 years, but what, um, what do I go up to them and say, Hi ed calling Mr and Mr d dot Mr Eddie Mcmahon.

Speaker 4:          00:23:20       You big fat lucky town was kissing. Johnny's asked for the list. Thirty years you budweiser sucking out slinging nothing. What do you do? I don't mean that in a way that was a joke. Right? And you know, not a nice joke, but hopefully, you know, he took it in the spirit that he was a big success and I was a new comic and that's the way he took it, you know. That's awesome. I watched Johnny Carson every single day. I never missed it. And I was a kid and that was it. There was no VCR is when I was a kid. But I would sit there and watch it everyday. I think I remembered you from that. When I first moved to La, I met you at the comedy store and I was like, from Johnny Carson. Sure, for sure. Saw Young Carson, a bunch of guys on Carson that wouldn't be in great comedians.

Speaker 4:          00:24:03       I saw Jenny on Carson for the first time. It was a great community. It was a great comedian. Did Ed smell like Daniel isn't even one of the most underrated guys, don't you think? If you go back to the people wouldn't know, but they'd know they'd go, yeah, that guy. But yeah, as far as like, uh. Do you remember how good, how strong his act was in the late eighties, the late eighties, the eighties. Like in the early nineties, he would go, he went to East side comedy club and they said he did a, he did three different shows in a row, three complete different hours, completely different from beginning to end. And he was mad at me for like 10, 15 years because when he started out he only had 25 minutes, like a lot of us and I had to cover for him and me and this guy, Mitch Walters, we were in Florida and at this place called the comic strip.

Speaker 4:          00:24:49       And he would, he would, we used to say we'd squirrel his money in the daytime. We would buy all the food for the place. Then he buys chicks it not buy drinks for chicks at night. And so we started calling them squirrel and you know, it was just like normal ball Boston, like very mild hazing. But he took it real seriously and he was hurt and he was, he was mad for years ago. But Richard, we're just kidding. But, you know, he was kind of, I mean, I didn't know that he was, it was so psychotic that he was in that kind of pain that he would shoot himself. But, you know, he, I did see symptoms of incredible insecurity and incredible holding onto things, you know. Uh, but I mean, that's so common with like really good comics, isn't it? There's so many good comments.

Speaker 4:          00:25:31       So just sell fucking nutty, you know, all of us are. I mean, I, I straddled reality a lot. I mean, it wasn't for alcohol and Xanax. I mean, I wouldn't go out of the house half the time. Really? Yeah, yeah, definitely. You have a boy or a girl, phobic feelings. I don't want to get internally at the oprah thing. But when did that start happening? Since I was a kid, since I was really bandon than the yellowstone national park, I was abandoned in the Grand Canyon. So I have a fear of widths. Uh, I dunno, I mean, how. I don't want to get too heavy, but yeah, I've always had. And you don't have any neurotic. You were up in bay, you weren't really abandoned. No, no, that's just a joke. It's not even a joke because the joke would be funny. That was kind of shocking stage. I would. I would start laughing because I thought you were like underneath that tree and I was thinking about little squirrels coming up and kissing you and try to web. Yup. I read this story recently about this guy who got killed by a bear real recently and they had a track down bed, did it? It's happened twice in the last year and the in in yellowstone, and it had to before, since the

Speaker 1:          00:26:44       19 eighties. It's pretty uncommon, but this one unfortunately wasn't just a kill. They had eaten part of this dude. So then you got to kill that bear. That's a bear. That's discovered that human beings are a food source and delicious by the way. And easy to remember eating sophie out.

Speaker 5:          00:27:04       Hello? Hello? Did I lose you podcast fans?

Speaker 1:          00:27:08       Chrysler's not swan, so it's the same thing. Don't make you gay. No, the fuck are you talking about bear. He's a bear. Nevermind. So the. They had to track this, pared down and kill it, and they're all tagged anyway. I don't think so. No, no, no. There's. I think a lot of them are. I don't think they've got them all. I don't know how they deal with that. You know, it's kind of a weird thing. This is this one wild area that people venture into, but there's this huge dog things that will occasionally fucking eat you, especially if they catch you with their cubs when they're with their cubs. They get, they get crazy. Well, what were you telling me before about the guy that beat up and killed all those bulls? What's crazy about one significant night in your life? Yeah. He knows. Somebody says, I got a story.

Speaker 1:          00:27:53       You got a story. I'll tell you this. Yeah, I want to say the exact right number, but I think it was something like 11 dead wolves and he had shot a bunch of them and then he had a apparently a run out of bullets or as gun jammed and then he beat a bunch of them to death with his butt. So they found him and like 11 dead wolves and then eventually the wolves got them the rest of the pack killed. Oh, they did get him. Oh yeah. He, yeah, he was a, I believe I said a lot. I said Alaska, but it might've been wrong. It might've been Canada. How many wolves were in that pack? I don't know, man. There could be 100 and another five or six. Sometimes they're like 30 or 50, but there had been super pacs cited recently in Russia that they're, they're really getting scared of that were in the hundreds. And what's funny about that is they're all starving to death. There's no fucking food out there. So they're sneaking into these, uh, uh, industrial area or the farming areas and she's fucking up their cattle. Just going in there. I mean, we're talking about a hundred bowls just coming in in a, in a mass swoop. Could you imagine if you're living, you're, you're some poor. Fuck, that's a sheep farmer in Siberia or wherever the fuck you are and you're just taking care of these sheep and it's freezing cold out and hear him.

Speaker 6:          00:29:14       I

Speaker 5:          00:29:14       hear that stupid shit every day and then one day you look out the window and there's 400 fucking wolves, 400 of them. Could you imagine 400 fucking walls, that feeling of being trapped in your house with 400 wolves out there and they just start jacking his, tear them apart right in front of you. I told you I made a confession of Joe this week that I didn't want

Speaker 1:          00:29:42       know. I finally told them why they didn't come over his house because I was afraid of his pit bulls and you know, I know that all I pictured was the bull flying through the air and latching onto my juggler and Joe's screaming. He never did this before. He really. He's really a sweet dog. They pray with people. Pimples are great with people. I remember. I remember you have to worry about one. They slid under the fence and was biting that other dog know he, he. I had to have my fence welded. I had to have a bar welded around the perimeter of the fence because he figured out that he could get his head in and bend the bars just by sheer force. Yeah. He had his. Any animals that we either so crazy. The kids that you have. Imagine your little girl and then it burned.

Speaker 1:          00:30:26       I spoken to her in the eye and the dog. You know what I mean? I agree with kids. It's very dangerous, especially if they don't grow up with the kids. If they're not a baby with the kids and they get jealous is that they get jealous and also they don't. They don't think of it necessarily as a human being. It's small. It's a different thing and they might bite it, you know, and that, that, that, that is possible. If it annoys them, they might bite it in, in, in a way that they would never bite a person, but they might buy the cat. You know what I mean? They're, they're dangerous at any dog is dangerous. It's not trained properly and especially dogs with a high prey drive except, but they're so fun to be around. They're so friendly and loyal and energetic and they're so happy to see you and they're so smart.

Speaker 1:          00:31:09       They're so smart dogs, but unfortunately all that intelligence comes with a burden and the burden is the way they are ultra dogs and the way they became ultra dogs as they raised them, fighting each other and they killed all the ones that weren't superior. They really just kept a strong blood lines, you know, so if you get a dog that's like a real fighting dog, those are some of the smartest dogs you'll ever have. Bryan county used to have this pit bull and it was like a direct fighting dog. We bought it from a dude who fought dogs. I was there with him. We went and this dude, they would gamble on dog fighting and the guy was explaining to us that the dogs don't die and he's like, you don't let your dog get killed. And he goes, it's all about gambling and it's all about breeding.

Speaker 1:          00:31:50       The pitfalls that it to them. He had been doing this for generation upon generation. Apparently I bought some. Michael Vick was saying that it was a cultural thing. Yeah. I don't buy that. Yield a lot of them by electrocuting them, man. That's the dark side of it is that they, they take these animals after they, you know, got to fuck each other up and then they shoot. One of them were killed. One of them, the one that quit, they don't even want them to breed. He got scared and turned away from the other dog. They don't even want them to breed. They want them to just fight mercilessly, fight until somebody pulls them off. It's just a fucked up thing to breed into a dog. It's a fucked up behavior trait to breathe in. There's this old frail lady in Burbank and walks her pit bulls, two of them every day and every time I see it I'm like, that's not cool. You have at least be able

Speaker 3:          00:32:39       to like if something happened to take care of it and that slap it with the white glove and not every pit bull will freak out. Fuck other dogs up. Some pit bulls are very well socialized and well trained and you know, they're exercised well so they're, you know, they get tired out and that's the important thing with dogs. Two dogs are just like people, man, you got throw the ball for the dog, you know, you gotta give the dog some space, you know, my dogs have a big yard to run around and it's great. They need that man. Dogs need, they need to be able to, you know, to just to blow off some steam. Otherwise their tents, you know, a dog into the house all the time. It doesn't get to get out of those dogs will bark and jump up in the air.

Speaker 3:          00:33:17       They're fucking freaking out. They're like, Jesus Christ, you keep me and locked them in a box all day. I'm a dog. I'm supposed to be out running around, you know? So if you have two pitbulls, man, you better make sure that you put those fuckers through a good little workout routine. I need to start bringing my dog here and kind of dog just sits there and says, ah, have a dog who's in love with me. He's gay and dog. He actually, when he sees me he goes, oh, you know, like real. Is that fucker good? Good. I loved this gut, but I mean really like, you know, they'll do dog bits like that, you know, that my act. But I mean, it really is amazing how his reacts to me. Whatever it is. Yet dogs are beautiful like that. That's why people like having them as pets or people talking about having like a pet bird or something.

Speaker 3:          00:34:02       Like what are you talking about? Stupid snake. Oh, get up by the paradigm. I went through a phase for awhile. I just saw. I met a really cool pair and I was like, that's so beautiful. I want that in my bedroom. And look, I had a pair of ones climbed up on my, uh, my shoulder and I had a baseball hat on and he bit the little top button off the top of the handles. Yeah, that'd be fun to have around. No, I didn't buy one had claws. I don't trust anything with claws. Get the fuck out of here. You know? Come on. God. What kind of creepy thing you got in your life that's a falcon on your of this new one that they just discovered. They just did the newest fossil that they've uncovered of the biggest bird that ever lived. It was 30 feet long and weighed 3000 pounds. It's giant fucking predatory. The monster is grey goose chases. Birds Dragon, right? Oh yeah. If it's 30 feet long, that's what you're asking. That's not a burden. That's amazing. Well, it's covered in feathers. It's really fucked. Or dragons, aren't they scale. Maybe they were scales and we just suck at feather detections. You know what I saw last night? Speaking of dragons, I saw the wrath of the titans. Is that what it's called? The one is a last one. Oh my God. Is it bad?

Speaker 3:          00:35:29       Oh my God. Is it bad? It's so bad. It's so. It's so bad that you were almost like, did you even this out

Speaker 5:          00:35:38       or did you just. Did you laugh at it? Was that bad or was stunning? It was stunning because it was for. First of all, the CGI is fucking incredible. Okay. As a CGI, seems like they just put the entire budget on making it look bad ass. I don't usually even like three d movies, but this is a really well done. Three d movie, like a kids movie. No. Well, yeah, sorta. I mean it's like pg or something like that. Maybe it's PG. 13 for violence, sword fighting and shit. A lot of the monsters were incredible. They had this fucking dragon thing. There's two headed dragon. Holy Shit. Was it cool? Like really fucking cool. There's good things about this movie. The. Yeah, the monsters. It's like a CGI CGI videos, monster porn film where the talking in between the fucking is way too long. You ever see like, come on.

Speaker 5:          00:36:28       Especially like if you're in a hotel room and you can't fast forward it, you got to just like sit and watch these dummies acts out this distinct. She likes you, kiss her, kiss her. I don't want to get rejected man. After Cindy left me, I just, I just don't have that kind of confidence anymore. Well, yeah. I don't know. What could I do that give you more confidence? I liked the, uh, the lesbian, they make me laugh. And Lesbian Porn. Yeah. Especially like the mother daughter was sick. Is that just. Yeah, that's fucked up. Mother Daughter Exchange Club where these mothers take their daughters over to switch those. The both go with older women, but the daughter ever seen that one? No, neither did I, but I heard about it. I wouldn't ever watch something like that sick. I have it on my phone. Yeah. I've saw one of them where a mother and daughter were sharing it. Derek, the mother was stuffed in the daughter's mouth and it was the daughter's mouth girl looked like her as the sun's Dick. No, I bet there's a video like that must be for real. There's one for everything. We've thought it up. Somebody is already like, come on. My glasses. Fetishes know that this foot fetishes were dudes only want to come on girls, feet, fetishes, wherever the people put fingers and guy's penis holes.

Speaker 5:          00:37:47       Guys like. And guys like. Then there's the other way around where you guys fuck girls, pee holes and like how is it possible to get a dig inside? There's videos. Look at it, it's fucked up. It's actually, people liked it, but I look at them every day. I saw a pop or rock thing happened last night. This, this is the craziest thing ever. Okay. Uh, we're at the Improv and for comedy juice and there's a big gang of comics outside of the Improv, you know, and just hanging out smoking cigarettes and shit. And across the street there's like this Mexican Tequila Bar and uh, this some, yeah, some celebrity came was coming out and the valet put their car there and it was like Lindsay Lohan style, Papa razzies everywhere, like fucking flashbulbs and fucking jumping on top of their car, like around the cars, you know, like, like surrounding

Speaker 7:          00:38:36       them, like Zombie style. And so they're in the car and they're taking photos of photos. So all the comics were just screaming stupid shit across the street. Nothing like really bad ones. It's like don't Princess Diana her and, and uh, like is that Lindsay Lohan and just stupid shit. And so the car takes out and it's some girl from I think a fast and furious to. I can't remember her name. Maybe even Mendez Menendez or something like that. I don't. I don't even know if that was her, but I. it's just not your first language. So she drove by and she's smiling at. It's like, like how you guys were funny while this whole thing happened. So it was cool because all the comics like yeah, mission accomplished and, but then second they left all the Papa razzies is big gang. Just fucking slowly started walking into traffic and cars honking the horn, slamming on the brakes and they didn't give a shit and they're just walking across the street and then getting up into all the comics. Face doesn't go. You got fucking problems. And like, like they were like, yeah. Then they were all about to like fucking just start beating the shit out. All these fat improv comic guys. Aggressive pumper Raj. Yeah. It was crazy. And then I pulled out my iphone and I started recording it because that's what I thought I would do. But unfortunately the, the facetime was facing me but I didn't notice it. So it's just my physical.

Speaker 7:          00:39:52       But then halfway through it I look over, I'm like, oh fuck. And I turned it over and then I show them all like walking away, like gang style, like walking through the street, like a fucking gang fight. Right. It was fucking crazy. So then, uh, uh, once they all, they all take off and selling, one of the paparazzis came back on this motorcycle going down the wrong way of melrose. It was like in and out of cars, like scary. It was scary as fuck slams on brakes across street talks to the valets points over to us and then fucking just takes off and blows through like two red lights. And I was just like, what the fuck are these pop razzing expect getting them. It was scary, dude. It was like, I was just sitting there going, what the, like you gotta think who these people are.

Speaker 7:          00:40:30       People their stockers or professional stalkers. They're fun. They're terrifying. Those guys are terrified. They're also, I think they have to fortify because a lot of people like lash out at them. Yeah. You know. Well now I don't, like you mentioned being in Lindsay Lohan. No, or somebody like that and just have that shit happened to them. That's scary about it is a better at that. What would you do? That's why I think the aids blood thing I was talking about, but you had aids blend just started like going in and around. Really. Honestly, I don't think it should be legal to have a gang of people just standing out there with a camera and photographing someone like that. Freaking people out and especially when they're walking into traffic like that, like that should be something you should be able to get in trouble for. It seems like, you know, if you want to go bust pot shops, pop shops are hurting anybody. These guys are walking in traffic and big giant groups from freaking out. Some chick it less and here's the big and less the real and less and less. She set it all up and that's exactly what I was thinking too because it was like, why is this one e five people and none of us knew who this girl is. I think that's what they do. Look, everybody's got to grind out of. I don't. I don't want to hit a

Speaker 1:          00:41:33       guy trying to make a living if the west wait and make a living as taking pictures of Eva Mendez or whoever the fuck it is, as long as they're not really harassing people and I don't think they offer for the most part. I think a lot of it. There's a few that'll mean like clearly when Brittany spears was going bonkers and shaving her head and running around and beat and cars with a umbrella. Clearly they were just following her there. There was no agreements there. They were like, let's follow this crazy bitch all day. She's about to do something. Nobody, you know, this is. This is easy pickins, but I know for a fact that people set up fake situations where they tell someone a Po, a publicists will set it up with the Paparazzi, so the proper. It waits for them so they make it look like it's a big deal. You know, like, oh my God, they're everywhere. I go, what am I going to do? Meanwhile they're fucking asking for it. They're setting it up. Of course. Yeah. It's part of a part of the whole, let's be famous thing.

Speaker 7:          00:42:27       It was scary though. It to me that, that if that was me that had that happen to me, like with all the. Because those people trying to pull out in their car and it was just like 20 people around the car. They were like, come on and get the fuck away from my car. You know, there's just like touching your car and shit and then that would dub and there's so much flashes. How are you even being able to see when you're. We're trying to pull out into traffic. The flashes alone, those people, any flashbulbs going off, all those people should be like tickets. Like if there's like, that's like saying that's like trying to distract somebody. Fuck texting flash bulbs in your fucking face. Well it's definitely just the

Speaker 1:          00:43:08       giant mass of people that you say or blocking the traffic you shouldn't be able to do.

Speaker 7:          00:43:12       Would you ever want Lindsay Lohan on a podcast? Why? I think it'd be interesting to talk to her. I think she thought I liked the skanky blonde look. I mean, she's got a beautiful, a redhead again, but then when she was blonde and it was obviously a little girl, she still to stay redhead, she might be the hottest. So I contention about a lot of celebrities when Michael Jordan was at his peak and I really believe that they, they don't, they find people annoying, but if they weren't, they weren't recognized. They feel insecure during a moment. Here. Don't bother me right now you think,

Speaker 1:          00:43:47       but a lot of these guys, some people, they definitely, it's, it's like being recognized is a big part of it for them. It gives them a charge when they go somewhere and they get recognized, you know, we had, you know, everlast with house of Payne who's on the other day. He's the exact opposite. He likes to sneak in

Speaker 7:          00:44:04       favorite podcasts of all time by far my favorite. Thank God. Damn good. This is too old to try harder. This could be okay. I feel like we're real close now. The reason why I liked it because he played live acute acoustics. Job Pretty much got her own concert. It was fucking off the songs.

Speaker 1:          00:44:24       New Songs we had not heard before and they were really good and he's a good father.

Speaker 7:          00:44:28       I was having heart palpitations. They can do what you can't do that

Speaker 4:          00:44:32       you love seemed so impossible, you know, because when people go stand up comedy so hard and I'm thinking playing a 12 string guitar, like this neurosurgeon friend of mine people left with, you know, like we can't have a neurosurgeon for it because we're like, you know, joke monkeys. That's whatever. I'm bad. I'm, no, I just go ahead because I know what you're gonna. Say what he says I could never do. You do. Exactly. Yeah. I mean you always have neurosurgery. I mean that's hilarious. He said, but he said, I can never do what you do. I said I didn't have released. You can kid around a little. You can kid around with your family. Make people eat. I can't do a little neurosurgery. It's true though. You can't pop in the dor a as this was getting the head cracked open. Well, there's a lot of people that wish they were funny.

Speaker 4:          00:45:14       It a lot of like really stayed. A lot of people think they're funny, some people think they're funny, but there's a lot of people that wish they were and just for whatever reason, they can't figure out how to how to do that. What is that? They take themselves too seriously. I don't. I think that's diluted a lot of times that there was a guy, he said, you know, I'd like to be a comedian. He goes, but I'm not funny. I go, well, you know, I'd like to be a fucking trapeze artists, but I'm not very acrobatic. You know what I mean? Like, what if you're not funny? How can you be a comedian when we know a lot of comedians that aren't funny but they're successful because they know some of the tricks and they're good looking or they're good at marketing themselves, you know?

Speaker 4:          00:45:48       Yeah. There's a lot of that. This is a lot of people that get to a certain level and you're like, wow, they really got that far. That's amazing. Yeah. What was that? You know? But they like piece together an act based on what they think is relevant right now. There's certain key things you can always say and get applauses, especially like if you're doing like a specific ethnic cultural thing, say like you're doing like a Latino. Oh brother, boom. You know me and they'll say a couple of Spanish words and you get like a big thing, you know what I mean? You see? But then you kind of see it with the talions. I sit with blacks, you know

Speaker 8:          00:46:23       what's up with that, Melissa?

Speaker 4:          00:46:25       You know, man. And the white guy who has a really good black. That's really good. Are you serious? Yeah. Yeah. That's pretty good. I thought it was a black guy in the room with me for a second. You close your eyes. Go ahead.

Speaker 8:          00:46:36       What's up? What's up with people who say what's up? Holy Cow.

Speaker 4:          00:46:42       Yeah. Don was the host of the, one of the first TV shows was over onto him and we did the thing in Montreal. That was it, um, comedy from the danger zone or something. Right, right. That was fun. Yeah. I remember bringing you up. Yeah. That was fun. Montreal. That was one of the best festivals ever. That's a. That was a fun festival. I love that city. It's a great city. Talk about fucking hot girls. Oh Lord, my goodness. Even the ugly sister. Beautiful. There's a lot of pretty girls up there, mark. Goodness is. It's amazing. It was pretty one sheet myself. Be Very Pretty. Ooh, what's amazing. Is it right below that as monsters? Fucking main monsters. Really not weird monsters. I know. You know. Not all monsters ladies. Don't get mad. I met some pretty girls and mean don't get me wrong. Look when I go home after living in Hollywood and you see the staff at the laugh factory and you haven't been there while there are standards, the could be like girls with the laugh factory.

Speaker 4:          00:47:46       They're so beautiful, right? I don't know who's hiring them, but it's, it's either a woman who's not jealous of other woman or a man because they're beautiful and I go back to where I'm from and not that I, you know, look at me and it's not like I'm so hot. I'm Kinda cute and way, but people look like, like extras from the hunchback of Notre Dame. What I mean like they're shuffling around and shit and you know, you get used to this level of beauty. It's out here. It's weird level of beauty two. It's like a really hard to maintain level. Oh yeah. You know, Katana, Katana, the Japanese restaurant next to the store. We were in Jones one night, me and my friend and he says, man, she's hot. I go, yeah, she's really hot, but she ain't Katana hot. What? I mean like there's all levels when there that's like the international beauties. There's a black chick, there's an American Indian, there's an Indian Indian, there's a white girl is ridiculously hot Asian girl with a star Tattoo over eyebrow or something and you're like, Whoa, my in a real movie.

Speaker 7:          00:48:48       If I ever dated another girl, I'm, I'm going to like olive garden, ugly. Like I'm not gonna hide. I think it's just too much work. I think I just need to be taken care of for a while. Like I did all these girls were. I'm like having to like be a certain person and I do a bunch of shit, like a lot of maintenance involved with dating, you know, like, uh, just try harder and harder. What does that mean? Like just tired of trying so hard that if I ever break up with my girl or whatever and then like if I think the next girl my day is going to be a girl, like a, like in a wheelchair. Do you have a girl now? Huh? Yeah, sure. You do a little here and there. So it's complicated. It's complicated. So what I don't understand what you're saying. What do you, what are you saying? You just want to be taken care of. You don't want to try. Like, you don't want to move so much. I don't like. I'm dating people way out of my league and so I think I need to go back to the, well, what is wrong with what's going wrong with the dating people out of your league? It's the disbelief while you're fucking though, what the Hell is wrong? Person me to fuck you.

Speaker 7:          00:50:09       What is it? Besides that? It's a reality. You let things slide more I guess. Oh, you know what I mean? Slide with shitty with you and you take it because they're hot as fuck. I'm not and I'm not talking about my current situation at all. I know what you're saying. Yeah. I'm just saying in general, well, I've been thinking about it

Speaker 5:          00:50:28       a lot lately is someone has to appreciate you as much as you appreciate them. If there's any sort of an imbalance like that, like if someone feels like they can shit on you because you won't do anything because they have the upper hand, the relationship because you'll never break up with that. There's a lot of people that get in those kinds of relationships and it's fucking stupid. That's a. that's a shitty way to live your life. It's a cowardly way to live your life and that's why a lot of damaged girls will date guys that are way under them and they do it on purpose to make sure that guy's not going anywhere. So a lot of times they'll meet like some other dude and fuck them on the side. That's what happens. I'm looking for a damaged girl. I really am. I had a need, somebody flawed because at my age I can't go out with women my age.

Speaker 5:          00:51:06       I'm not going to go, come on grandma and flip over, you know, I'm attracted to girls in their twenties now I'm a lot older obviously, so it never stops and. No, but I mean what I'm saying is I need somebody with issues recently with daddy issues or flawed in some way are so enamored by my tablet. They don't look at me like the Mongolian looked that I am. You know what I mean? I really got an annual thing going on. I do look Gelica slapped my face, God from eating, drinking and I see you're actually trying to watch your diet now mean you had the Chorizo and eggs for one egg. Whites. Egg was like, that's kind of counteract that. Teresa did the same thing. Take weights and sausage. Jerry's Deli. So delicious though. It's hard. You know, let's have a cheat meal every now and then.

Speaker 5:          00:51:54       That's a good place to do it. It's not for me man. So close to the comedy store. It's open 24 hours a day, three waffles, best place on sunset as the standard. If they still have the same kind of food, I don't like it anymore. You know what they add to tip to it, uh, your, your, your, your food. And I just looked at it the other day and I'm like, wait, how long have they been doing this? They just kind of put the tip into your total. So you gave him a double tip and for a good year. Good, good. You did well. Good job. I just don't like people that do that. Yeah. Well they probably had to do it because so many fucking drunks come out of that bar. Also people, Europeans and Canadians. And that is sort of an international sort of makes sense that they know everything about our culture and then all of a sudden they don't know about tipping.

Speaker 5:          00:52:40       Yeah, they don't. That's an alien to them. It's a funny thing. They know a lot of them knowing they use it as an excuse. Yeah. But it's weird when you ever go to, you've been to, uh, England and Irish many times you tip over there and they look at you like, what you had done a lot. I had American, you know, remember ritual. Yes. He said to me, I got tipped in Scotland. He goes, don't tip these people. You're going to ruin it for all of us. Japan. You don't tip in Japan. Oh No. Yeah, it's weird. It's weird how we do. I. Who else does it besides Americans to the French tip? No. Right. Ten percent. Maybe 10 percent of fresh is different. There's. Well, I mean there's a thing they're on there for a tip and a lot of the credit card. Well even Canadians are different because Canadians don't tip is about Americans because you know,

Speaker 3:          00:53:26       wages. Nobody to much American told me that. That was what she, that was her nickname for black people or Canadians because they didn't tip just like an. Yeah, that's an interesting phenomena. The black culture does not tip and I know the black culture, but it is a portion of generally, of course, all black. I mean, I've been out with Charles Barkley to be a name dropper and he's ridiculous. Ridiculously generous. He's a. he's a very. God didn't gave me, this kid was late with the food. Do you ever hear this story? I know he was late with the food. It took them a long time. Charles gave him a rolex. Here he goes, here. Maybe this help you keep time. Wow. That's cool.

Speaker 3:          00:54:09       Yeah, it is. Unfortunately a stereotype though that fits, you know, there's a, there's a video online of this girl who gets back from a restaurant and it's like, why? I think it's calling, why I got a tip and have you ever seen it? It's got millions of hits and people were so in the fucking comments was a race war though. The goddamn comments were a race war and she's basically, she's just being an ignorant dumb ass and you know, just flaunting and on camera. Like wow, I got a tip like who says who says I got a tip? And someone came out and ran out and met her in the parking lot and said, hey, you shouldn't be stiffing us. And, and have you ever seen him pull it up, pull it up because you want to hear about why I got a tip, waitresses tents up on youtube or the waitress was telling me how, like a lot of times the black girls are mean to them when they're in the audience and my theory on that, and tell me what you think is that black women get stiffed a lot culturally and invite a lot of black men because part of a success in some eyes have some black men, is to have a white chick.

Speaker 3:          00:55:18       You know what I mean? They're part of the culture until they become a celebrity or something. Then they got this toll Nordic blonde with them on some of this and say why I got tip? Why? Why the fuck I gotTa to know? That's really why the fuck look, look up whatever she's referring to. That's the one that is. Why the fuck I got a tip like I, you know, it's unfortunate. It's unfortunate that any culture would have an inclination towards being stingy. You know? That's, that's unfortunate. I think the best thing that could ever happen to people in the black community that get, get accused of this is for it to become embarrassing. Then I'm all for it to become ridiculous before. It's like, you know, like everybody should realize that the only way to prosperity is through generosity. If you're not generous person, you'd probably not going get anywhere and that you really holding yourself back by not being kind and not, not, you know, not being generous to other people. You know, it's a, it's a shitty a aspect of any culture. But this one chick, do you find it?

Speaker 3:          00:56:31       You see? Those are all reasons. Ari's why the fuck I gotta do a search for why the fuck I got a tip jar. You got to get rid of this kid doesn't even have a goddamn laptop. He's go this silly ipad thingy. Thinks he's slick. I might be just be not on. I don't even need it anymore. It's on man. It might not be on youtube anymore. Like she pulled it down. See it's, I think it's called. Why the fuck? Yeah, and that those all reserves. Do you think somebody pulled it down? Will you? People were so mad at her. She probably did pull it down.

Speaker 3:          00:57:09       Anyway. Whatever. It's unfortunate. And then, you know, I'll say this on the podcast and I'll get a bunch of things on twitter to the moon. People angry at me. You know, a lot of black people chip in. Will they actually do. If everybody knows, you're telling me that a lot of them don't. Yes. A lot of them don't tell them that's our experience from living in new clubs for the last 20 years. Ya know what I mean? It's also true of the British and the Canadians and you know, Italians are generous. I got to say being Italian, they want to make sure people are looking though. I got A. Yeah, I got it. I'm over here. Yeah, we'll wrestle for a fucking check. You and I,

Speaker 3:          00:57:55       I'm in. Hilarity is next week in Cleveland. You never went through hilarious and Cleveland. I know. What did I do? I did the Improv in Cleveland. You'd love hilarity? Yeah. Good place. Beautiful. Rarely get to Cleveland. I've only been there once with Charlie Murphy and Heffron were touring across. Great Guy. Yeah. You would like Charlie Murphy too. I never met Sharon. I looked at me and him. Yeah, he, uh, he's got an interesting story. That was the guy you want to have fucking balls. He got on the Chappelle show when he was in his forties. Okay. He had no success up to that really, you know, a little bit here and there, but really struggling. Got to the Chappelle show and all of a sudden started doing stand up and start with headline and like within a couple of months, that's 45. Oh, Jesus Christ. Nope. It's a, it's a, a bike check. That's. Well, maybe it doesn't exist anymore. Maybe she pulled it down. Doesn't matter. Whatever. Um, yeah. She said. Oh yeah. Okay. Well the point is, it's unfortunate when people are shitheads no. And what was your theory about the black girls? They get shafted in life. No, I think sometimes they get bitter because they find that a lot of the black men become successful. Think of something. This is not a general generalization. This is, I mean, I mean this is a generalization obviously, but sometimes like they,

Speaker 5:          00:59:22       they find getting a white woman is an arm piece and a sign of success. You know what I mean? It's a weird thing in. Or maybe they just liked the way it looks or maybe they just want to fuck it to the man. Maybe just think of it. It's like some white dude to suppress them. Daughter fantasy. Going on pound in it. Do you think that's it Brian? He keep nodding. I'm just trying to think of something. Right? How big your next girlfriend's going to be a buck. 70 bucks. We love him. Going back to an average girl, I got to get myself on average or less than amber dating porn stars. The the girl that I lost my virginity when she added me on facebook today. Funny. Is Porn star the term when you figure they could suck to Cox for the first time?

Speaker 5:          01:00:04       Never Star. Imagine the rest of show business that easy. I don't remember being called a comedy star and I did the tonight show. You know what I mean? I had done hbo specials, all this Shit. They're homemade comedy. Struggling a comedian comedy store. Yeah. That is interesting. It's like we're so uncomfortable with sex that when we throw the word porn around, we have to have some nice star Pornstar rocket, like a porn star, you know? Oh, he's a rock star. Do you still watch a lot of porn? No, I try not to talk about camming nowadays. What about, you know, but it's try not to. But there was a worm that came out like Trojan, half a million freaked me the fuck out. Last shouldn't get freaked out. She turned your Java off son. You know what helped me was blood pressure medication. Yeah. Because with blood pressure medication that lowers your libido.

Speaker 5:          01:00:58       So now I feel just like I'm like kind of Irish, healthy sexually but not like fucking monkey who has the fuck everything and all the time and telling and genetics. I mean literally we both have those wonky Sicilian. Yeah. We have that. Like if you get done fucked and you go home and jerk off thinking about what you just did, how much fucking sexy. Like I remember like, you know, sophie turned into me going, how much do you need? You know, can you just play with my ass while I'm asleep? And she said, oh, getting too comfortable with you. Is it because of the Alfredo Chicken Alfredo Alfredo sauce? That's what the Italians are known for. It's a, it's caveman genetics is what it is. It's very simple. Was we look like trolls will short wide people. That's, that's a psyllium look, you know, wide fat head people. That one, Chris. Fuck a lot. Remember Christie? Kristy was a redhead. Yes, she was. She had a great body. Oh my God. She did we go into the wayback machine with diamond. Get out of my way back when I got hard on 95

Speaker 7:          01:02:20       back in the desert. I just got silk sheets. Have Your own silk sheets. What's one of those things is like, why have I ever or done this before? It is amazing. Why would you ever have regular sheets that you're laying there? It's like laying in this silky. It's nice image. I like to get out of my head. I got to lie alone. Naked. You take your underwear off because remember the blankets to have this piece on the end, over one leg. Remember this, the blankets that had the silky on the end used to be like put it against your teeth when you were a baby and like all that stuff. You mentioned a whole blanket out that silky and you're was so amazing. So it's only like $40 on Amazon. I highly recommended just by some silk sheets. You'll, you'll never buy regular sheets again. I don't think we'll get you a brian. Do you do it all naked? I do it all the time. Goes to buy sheets. Can Imagine Joe going by and she had to buy something for yourself to orgasm just with your penis on the sheets?

Speaker 5:          01:03:13       Probably could. Yeah. I mean it's really soft. So where they get these uh, Amazon. Amazon is satin sheets. Fixture dom naked. Oh, arm's flopping back and forth like a seal. Oh, you come from me. I always love when they always say when you come from, you know what that means. I'm getting tired with your and y'all get off me fucking freak. Crazy asshole. Hope next week South Park's all about this

Speaker 7:          01:03:48       gang and silk sheets. You don't taste. People were really listening hope so I think that would be so cool. It would be hilarious if. Because the week before, I think anybody who watches it, if it would know, no one knows what we're talking about. Uh, there was a. we've talked about this bigfoot show and then they talked about it on south park and someone on a message board said, oh, someone from south park probably heard you guys talking about. I'm like, but hold on, but anybody who watches that bigfoot show is going to get the same job, but you're only missing half of it though. Well also in that episode, supposedly I haven't seen this episode, but supposedly there was a part where it's like, don't just hit your butthole is all day or something like that. Cartman says. And then the week before I have this whole thing at desk squad where I take a take a piece of bread and I take the ICAT bread where you, I tell my fans to send me photos of them taking a piece of bread, taking a hole out of the middle of the brand and then putting their cat head through it and I've been doing it for about a month or so.

Speaker 7:          01:04:40       And then after that, that last week's episode is all about like fucking cap reading and shit like that. No, I didn't. I didn't invent it, but it was definitely a lot of people like a really small niche of the Internet, you know? It was just there on the Internet. Oh No, no, I'm just saying that. It's kind of funny that, that, that's something that I've been doing a lot lately on twitter, but I'm not clear though. Are you accusing them of watching? No, no, no, no, no. Here's what I'm saying. Last week when last week's episode, it was really weird watching it because for the last month that's what I've been doing on twitter nonstop. So it was kind of cool to see that. And then this week I heard that they were talking about big foot and itching assholes and I'm like, this is getting cool. I hope everything that we talk about becomes a cell phone.

Speaker 7:          01:05:24       They're going to do is an episode about a retard radio host who can't get his facts straight. Cartman for something. We didn't really do a garden, but did you say cat breading? Cap Reading? It's. It's so fun. Are you talking about breeding breading now? You can take a crust of bread. You make a hole in it and then put your cat's head through it and you take a photo. He's a grown man. Who isn't that strange? It's just fun to know. Don't tell them they don't make people like him in Philly. Do they know? Where are you from? Ohio? Where a Columbus. Hello? Columbus. I when it's still in my Italian, like growing up. I don't need a new one. Uh, Italian. It was my dad's best friend and he lives in a, I think Pittsburgh. And the only thing I would, or only time I ever go to Pittsburgh back and forth, once a year we'd go and they have this huge party where he can just, some fights, all his families. It was like the coolest thing ever. That's how I know Italians were my first time was that they were just, had these huge parties with hundreds of family members once a year. And we were invited to that all the time. It was so cool. Uh, my first introduction, Italians, the Italian American society,

Speaker 4:          01:06:33       comes to see me every year at Columbus at the funny bone really. And so they invite me to dinner that day, the day I come in, which is Wednesday. And it's always fun. You know, Dino, Dino, who's most willing to show that you did it? You've done the funny bone. Yes. Anyways, so I go to this thing and it's at the Italian club and last long story short of fight fucking breaks out at a club. But the club members wasn't like a club, like a club in the public. They're having a vote for the president gets up and starts talking. It's one guy goes, you know, it escalated so quickly, like, like one of those the fuck you looking at nothing who you calling? Nothing. Fuck, you know, that kind of like, you know what I mean? I'm like, we're real close to it. It was like, you know what you were saying, you were saying about how you've seen things like your hell unflappable.

Speaker 4:          01:07:23       You are like, you've seen things right next to you and it doesn't even faze you like the violence. Oh yeah. Let's see. So many fights. That's what happened here, but it was such an unlikely place. [inaudible]. It was like everybody's cheering each other. They're all either either Italian or have to have some connection to Italy, you know, whatever. And a real fight broke out and I couldn't believe it. And you know, you want a piece of this. I always thought that was one of the more unfortunate aspects of our culture. Italian Americans are very prone to violence, very rounded. Fistfights, Italians and Irish and Italians and Irish. Irish in you, right? Yeah. I got the best of both worlds. Three quarters as I am one quarter Irish. Yeah. That's they're always like, well fuck you, look at it. There's always a lot of that, especially the east coast, although scruffy immigrants raised kids that carried a lot of those same mentalities. The east coast is definitely more hostile. Do people ever

Speaker 5:          01:08:16       asked you about the mob? Like you know it because you're. But, you know, they were asking, you know, I, I get it all the time really well because of where I'm from. And like, you know, like I lived in a poor black neighborhood in west Philadelphia. We moved from an Italian neighbor, mean like we were really connected to the mob. Yeah. Were undercover, you know, it's why we're in this row home in a black neighborhood. But uh, because we were the press whites, you know, which was a very interesting perspective of life because people don't ever think about what about the white kids that were let back in a black neighborhood. I was lucky because I played ball and they were all my friends, but you couldn't walk through there just like a black kid couldn't walk through the Italian neighborhood. Is that fucked up?

Speaker 5:          01:08:55       Yeah, it's fucked up. When are we going to move past that? When you know the people, they're all, you know, you like him? Yeah. Oh yeah. Of course. It's like any other community. It's all about deciding who's going to be nice to, Oh, you know, he decided these are the people we're going to be nice to and you're not going to be nice. Those assholes over there now. Well, we were talking about how we were in Kentucky. We were in Louisville and Louisville was playing Louisville. And how did that go when they were playing crazy? They started a riot and cars, cars on fire and shit. But the crazy thing is it's Louisville versus Kentucky. It's like assholes. It's ridiculous. You were in the same, same stack as a fucking civil war. This is the most preposterous thing ever. Yeah. Well what I liked the same thing with Auburn and Alabama and they, it took a tornado to blow through Tuscaloosa for those people to get in touch with each other.

Speaker 5:          01:09:47       You know, the same people. It's crazy. They're so prone to like hate the neighbor or eight to. Oh, the hatfields and mccoys. Yeah. No, I mean, I said a onstage about Michigan in Columbus, Ohio state's group balloon man. Why are you even talking about. Yeah, I've had people from Columbus Shit on. People from Cincinnati. Yeah, yeah. Fuck Michigan. I hate them. I don't know. Meanwhile, we're all supposed to be Americans. All preposterous, all these stupid fucking little leaguers. Mother's hanging out. Preposterous. I said, I can't help myself. You must be a Michigan guy. He has a very prodigious vocabulary. It's preposterous. Has been the word of the month. Oh, is it? Yeah. I've been blasting it out. Every time it comes into my stupid head, it gets into a groove where you can start saying words that definitely. Because I remember when we used to say something else, Joe was the first one I ever heard say what ever bananas or whatever you was the first one that made that inflection and it's spread all over the valley.

Speaker 5:          01:10:51       What ever you did, you were the first one. Yeah. You're the first one I ever heard. Say it and then everybody started saying it and then he didn't say it. As much as I say, I don't understand what you're saying, why, you know, you'd be talking about like something that would piss you off and you know what ever, you know, it's like the instead of saying whatever you made that beat what ever and then I didn't know I did that. I really have no idea. I get Joe, I know you so much. You know me very well. My friends, we've known each other a long time. Tell me more. Tell me more. We'd known each other since the nineties. We met back in the day when I was living in New York. I'm really bad at it. Caroline's or at um, um, Amsterdam. Billiards wants to. We just ran into each other.

Speaker 5:          01:11:41       Tom and railroad can shoot a hell of a game of pool. Tell you that. I'm going to start saying that. Yeah. That's what ever the pause that makes it so unique and that caused the middle of whatever. That's where all the brilliance lies are used to crack me up when people go to me a like, whatever. Like you're going to take credit for that. And then you were the first one I heard, but like people would say to me, does it bother you that the sopranos do Bada Boom, Bada Bang? I go, no. They go, well you did it before them. I go, well, because I was around before the show started. I didn't make up acting Italian. Yeah, I didn't make them forget about it. You know why I was the first one that should forget about it. I had the nastiest thing happened to me last night, dropped my iphone in my beer and hold it out real fast.

Speaker 5:          01:12:27       And then I just did the first thing. I thought of it like I'll suck all the beer out of the like sucking the holes like as hard as I thought it was. Shit was coming in my mouth. But then like something like a slime thing. Flew mouth. I'm like, was that earwax or what the fuck was that? So I don't know if it was a orange hefeweizen or if it was a battery to have advisors. Dude, stop it. It was a piece of orange. Yeah. But I was like, like your beer. And had a simple orange, I'm your, I'm going to be your Colombel and chill. What's wrong? What's wrong with him? If there's anything wrong with them. I've been working with his fucking ass off for a decade. He doesn't use anything wrong with him. He thinks it's me. He was like, you know, you just, you're just tense from the east coast.

Speaker 5:          01:13:12       You crazy with all that karate. She. The interesting thing is the word retarded convenience issues, but there is something we'll do respect to something retarded about you. Look, even that basement looked at. He has kids my age difference. Well I think so. Everybody or a 37 year olds are rocking it. Like, yeah, I'm 37 and I rock it like a 22 year old, which is different. But what do you rock? I'm rocking a Nintendo shirt right now. Do you think. I wonder if he's a Manchild. You know what? I imagine a lot of them work in the computer game industry. A lot of Manchild in the comic book world. You didn't know what your target market is. You get this Gig. I mean a bullet. People. Joe knows what the fuck you doing over there. One's and zero's talking. By the way, I'm going to start talking like dropping a one or a zero in normal conversation just to put code into actually communication.

Speaker 5:          01:14:08       Know what you're saying. That what if you like to have the one zero listens for a nuclear bomb when at the end of the time, you know when someone deciphers all your fucking sentences for the month to figure out a nuclear bomb. Seven. It's not seven dummy to one or zero. You can't say seven out sloppy code. The new shit. Yeah. This is what I do with them. Don. I'm sorry. Oh No, no, you're good. I think I could do better, I think. What do you think I should do with them? I would cut his hours down. Cut his so that he, when he comes in, he's more focused. That's casting. You do understand? We smoke a shitload of weed before he drove Rogan. Wait, so you get to see it. The medical. Uh, I think for that show that's what's important. We both do what? What's your, what do you have to say that your, your element is today? How do you get medical look at entertainment? What's right with them? I'm not even. What's fine? What's your anxiety? It's good. Uh, yeah. Yeah. The whole world. Does that help? Uh, no, no. It doesn't help me. I don't have anxiety. Um, I do have um, uh, definitely helps me go to sleep. It makes food taste better.

Speaker 5:          01:15:26       I think the light's just playing a, it helps, uh, if you've got injuries via Achy, makes you feel a little bit better. Relaxes you find it relaxes my muscles, you know, like Xanax, they all like the. We don't really know. I don't like smoke. Really. You can eat it, you know, you, you can eat, need to attack what you said. You haven't smoked weed, those sense, uh, for a very long time. And if you take so much xanax you might just take a hit once just to see if it does anything for you and get that new stuff because this is a cheaper alternative that will probably drink a lot though. I'm doing good. I drank a lot. He said it was like my vitamin you drink everyday. Do you like Ed Mcmahon style? I do and I'm hung over every day, which is really a testament to my comedy because it's great.

Speaker 5:          01:16:24       That's a great thing about being a comedian. You can actually function as an um, I'm way more joe then when we hung out a lot. I'm way more alcoholic then I think because I graduated to a hard hard liquor. Oh yeah, because of a girl. I don't know where to go from here. No, because, uh, my girl, my sister died a couple of other things. So. But I find that to be a really fun habit. You know, I don't like the hangover, but I time it, I go, well, if I go to sleep, pick a hamper, xanax and six hours I'll be all right. Right now I'm a little dizzy from the combination of the tranquilizer and the alcohol, but I do feel better. Are you supposed to take those two together? No. No. How bad is it for you? It's pretty cool. It can stop your heart.

Speaker 5:          01:17:09       Yeah. You can tell. You're like, well, it's worth it. No, that's why I keep the time in between them. It like six to eight hours. I made that up. I totally made it up. That's what I'm thinking. That's what in the alcohol metabolize and about that much. If I'm drunk I don't take anything. If I feel drunk. No, I wait until I feel. But if you take the Xanax and you're under the effects of it, sometimes they'll have a couple drinks. No, no, not usually. I mean not. So it's one of the plane, maybe A. Yeah, it's one of the other hoping there's a doctor on board. Yeah. Yeah. Um, you shouldn't do that. You should switch to. We'd get off my back. We didn't even know me. Man. What is the main reason why you're doing this? What is the main reason for Xanax?

Speaker 5:          01:17:56       Xanax for anxiety, anxiety, anxiety, know, just like panic attacks. When did these start? When I, uh, when I was four for real. This is a lesbian and raped one of my entire family. They passed me around the room. They plugged me like a joint fleshlight joy. It just started pumping, uh, the eggs I always had. Anxiety I was at, I want a psychiatrist when I was in seventh grade. Really? I was thinking, well, that's why I'm here to rebuild myself and I'll be at hilarity next week and you could see me a captain. Brian's the following two weeks at a time. I went to a psychiatrist. My mother sent me a psychiatrist and what was it? Four? I was in love with him. No, I'm kidding.

Speaker 5:          01:18:45       I wish for, you know, pat anxiety, panic attacks and wow. I have all the same things. I went to the hospital about a year and a half ago. I had to pull over and call nine, one one on myself because I have an anxiety attack. Really cost me a lot. I hope you know. I was kidding. And he was high as fuck. Yeah. You've actually started. Something's already started. It's already starting to hit me here. Yeah. Well you were high as fuck when you pulled over. I wasn't. I just didn't eat all day. You hallucinate A. Yeah, I was. I was starting to see like trails and stuff. I felt like I was having a heart attack the whole time. I was like typical symptoms like and I was like holding my neck and I could feel my heartbeat, but the thing that I didn't like the ambulance and they were like, yeah, there's something wrong, and I'm like, oh, now looking back, I'm like, well, how don't know.

Speaker 5:          01:19:30       You might've had a heart attack mean, didn't know you were having a panic. I love these people that think they have heart attacks. They don't have chest pains, don't even know what a fucking heart attack is going to have. Chest pains. They have a heart attack. I get that. You would think so? I would. I'm pretty sure I'm was a smoker. I get those too. Sometimes. You know, he's a smoker toe. Oh, you smoke cigarettes. A lot. Kids will workout. Oh No. I'm like, I'm pretty much like you. I didn't know I work out though. Yeah, I'll work. Yeah, I work at dawn massage. You know what that is? It's very low impact. You can actually eat while you're doing it. It's a form of. I watched myself on a video just exercise and I exercise that I, I consider masturbation working out. Is this a bit. No bit. I think you might want to throw that one out and it's never been in.

Speaker 5:          01:20:22       What'd you say about working out? What if you fuck pillars? That's like working out. So that's kind of any movement you do more two minutes to your life on this planet. Is that true? Especially for him? Yeah, sure. It's one step on a grave. One by appeal. Dead Man. Dead Man walking. I get. I'm not taken care of this vehicle now he's just riding it and stuff and cheetos and do it a little shit. Beer and the cigarettes are. The real issue was fucking unbelievably bad for you. Yeah. Yeah, they are really bad. You never get that right? Should I go to sixth grade? What did you do it for? No, I used to get. My grandfather would get samples and I would smoke cigarette one after another in the fucking that we so dizzy. It was like, yeah, I thought, you know, you get high by smoking just like only after another.

Speaker 5:          01:21:14       He. I did, but it's not a fun high. You're dizzy or lightheaded, you know, roll up. I never threw up, but it's nauseating. I threw up from chewing tobacco once, so gross the baseball player spit that shit. But it's on a rug. Yeah, the astronaut. It's a rug. It's not like grass where it gets absorbed into the ground. Right. What is that? Are they allowed to spit it on the astroturf? They do. You see them? Oh yeah. Fucking nasty. Remember that scene from the naked gun or something where the world starts spitting and. Yeah, they're just hilarious. Fucking figured out how to do that. Isn't it funny that that's legal? Chewing tobacco, but cocoa leaves our legal thing, which is probably better for you. Matter of fact, it's definitely better for you. I don't think people were eating chewing cocoa leaves and getting cancer. Have you ever see these new cancer commercials in?

Speaker 5:          01:22:07       Oh my God. Scared the fuck out of here. Have you seen that one, Brian? They're pretty bad. They're all are. They all suck. Especially like when they have holes in their throats and that doesn't make you want to quit smoking. Guys looking at a windows maybe. How long have you been smoking? Since I was 15. But the idea of starting now, after all we've seen that's really crazy drinking every day like, I don't know, alcohol is bad for you, but the idea of like figuring out. I think I'll start this. I think I'll start this habit that I don't have yet. Just, you know what, what made you start? Because you're saying you were way more of an alcoholic now than you were. It's a progressive disease, you know. That's the fun thing about it. Did you get better at it? Do you ever decide to do anything about it?

Speaker 5:          01:22:51       Do you ever decide to slow down, take whatever. I'm hung over. I quit until that night. Then we had a funny thing. I was on a tour bus, remember when I was roping for sure. Yeah. We're funny thing that I created this waitress at the laugh factory about the other night. Me and my friend Ali, we never slept on the bus and were drinking all night and we go, we got to quit drinking a. okay, alright, this is it. It's stupid. It's fucking killing, killing our bodies. And so in about an hour we're sobering up and we go, you know, men drink it for a while and it's night and scraping sober. What do you say? We celebrate our sobriety with the drink. So that was, you know, that this girl the other night a, the factor. We did something like, she goes, I'm not drinking that. I said me neither.

Speaker 5:          01:23:40       All right, well we'll have one as a reward for not drinking. You don't drink. I drink. I don't drink a lot. I can take a shot man. I can do shots. Yeah, I like to try to keep it as balanced as possible. You could get addicted to just getting fucked up all the time and going onstage, onstage stage. Fucked up anything. I really lose it. Quickness. Yeah. How many times he got upset onstage. Fucked up accidentally though. Maybe 10, maybe. Maybe 20. 50. I hit, you know when you know what's bad is getting drunk. If you're going to do an hour because you got to pee, you know, you've got to really watch that. That's true. But I have A. I'm not better as a drunk because I'm not nervous doing standup. So alcohol does me no good. It just dulls me and it and it slows the quickness down the reaction a little bit, you know, supposed to timing on. I mean I'm, I'm much better on coffee than I am one booze. Yeah. Because I don't have any fear of the stage, you know, fear of. I'm going to get you some of this alphabet and stuff for real. Take it before you go on stage telling an hour before. What is it? The stuff we're selling it on, it's all. Yeah, I got bottles of it,

Speaker 7:          01:24:57       something the other day I was really, it started doing where I'll order it like a vodka and diet coke and then I'll tell the guy like everyday, every three of them make them just diet cokes and so I don't even know when I'm doing it or not. And I felt drunk at the end of the night and I was like, how many have I had it? He was like, you've had any auto and you've been here for six hours, so you're from.

Speaker 5:          01:25:18       So you couldn't have been yourself like it was psychosomatic, but it wasn't even like I was like, am I drunk? I don't even know if I'm drunk or not. Like I was confused. Is he retarded? Tell me this is the first time you're hanging out with them. You don't know if you're drinking alcohol at any. Are you liking my journey? I understand. You know what he's like as if this is a contradiction in terms. He's a really bright retort. No, that's what I mean. I don't know how else to put it. Like this is exactly how my facebook. That should be your new thing on your message board. Happiness of like a retarded kid, you know, the joy that they have with a smile. He's pretty happy. I'm pretty happy. Go hang out with more. Yeah. Yeah. Always hanging out with all this porn star friends.

Speaker 5:          01:26:03       You really fucking porn stores truck. Yeah. The, your scheme that they've been there or they're not the girl. Girl, girl, girl, porn stars. The girl girl. There you go. The only as. Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. You don't really have to do that from Regina. And I know it looks like you would get a kick out of that. Yeah. It's a weird world. It's uncomfortable getting to know that world that with the normal to them too, which is very strange. Well, it's, it's so stereotypical. That's the weird. The weird thing about that world is, you know, a lot of them are very nice and you get to meet them and you're like, wow, this is just some nice girl who just somehow or another she found herself in some situation where she has this almost insatiable desire for sexual attention. And lot of that is because they were molested.

Speaker 5:          01:26:53       And then when you find that out, it's a buzz kill. Then you start feeling bad. That humanized. Humanize them. You're gonna lose all your fantasy. You lose your boner for sure. When you, um, when you talked to some of them, some of them say that nothing's ever happened to him. And I believe in, I think there's, it's possible that they could need attention for other reasons. Yeah, a more. I don't know, maybe they just rationalize it. I don't know. You know, or maybe that's just their reality. And they don't have a problem with it. I'm not saying there's anything wrong with it. I'm saying when you delve into that world, it's gotta be something wrong. Well, a lot of times there is strippers. Dean, I never met who was really working their way through law school. Very rare. Some of them do like a Mike Young joke. Yeah. A bunch of genius trippers. I never heard that. Yeah, I saw him last night. Same jokes and no I didn't watch. Sorry. I just talk to them. But how would you ever like him at Ice House? Would that be okay? Sure. Cool. Why'd you bring that up in the air? And I don't know if joe said No. Yeah, this fucking guy. Well we've talked about Mike Young so many times on podcast, but we've never had him on anything. He got his ass kicked one time. Remember? That was brutal. He's got an interesting story about that.

Speaker 5:          01:28:12       Yeah, I mean I wouldn't want things going. Is that him? I don't know. It's not. My phone is so not my phone at your phone or your phone, Bro. I don't even know where my phone is. That's because it's fucking ran. You crazy bitch. He just had. He was sucking on it. Yeah, I remember the whole thing. You. It wasn't stuffed it under your ass to work with them on a regular basis. Tom, do you do stand up? Yes. On the road with Jodi. Is She? I know you told me you don't. You don't believe he does stand up a well. You find that shocking. I find it a little clump. Uncomfortable to talk about what? What's black and on top of the stairway. Well, Christopher Reeves after a fire.

Speaker 5:          01:28:55       That was really good like five years ago. That's good to hear. Good Krista. Good. Chris Christopher. Now you wonder why you get hate mail. You wonder why people abandon a couple of people from talking shit about Joe on the message board. Oh, by the way, did you watch the podcast? Your message board now has a podcast that Jay mute jason and Voodoo and Johnny rotten did do it themselves or might fly up one day and go to. We should do a gig up. That'd be awesome Gig in Seattle. And then do the broadcast. Definitely. You know, it's a joke that I love. Tell him, what did you think of this? Maybe you heard it. It goes to psychiatrists. Psychiatrists is. What's the problem? He goes, I don't know, Doug. I just can't seem to keep any friends. You Fat. Fuck what? You said you went to a psychiatrist when you're 17, if you've been in 13. Oh 13. Really? Twelve, 13 years. Wow. Have you been as an adult? I'm not a psychiatrist. Psychologist. That's the kind of. Don't prescribe drugs. Right?

Speaker 9:          01:29:59       Want to talk about that?

Speaker 5:          01:30:02       No. Telling you like pot. The xanax stuff. What does it do? It kills. Anxiety. Makes you relax. That what it does. Yeah, it's great. It makes you feel like you're. You're a normal person. What I've heard though is that if you take it and then you get off at the anxiety actually increases. Well, I wouldn't get off it. So it's a daily thing. Every day. I had just heard from someone, we were just talking about this and he goes, I couldn't fucking imagine taking xanax every day. He just said this to me because it makes you sleepy. I don't know. I don't know what it does. Is it do it? Do you want to try one? No. Well, why don't we. When we get in the car, I'll give you one. I don't think it's for me. I've actually tried it now. I'm glad that you do part.

Speaker 5:          01:30:49       I'm glad I. I'm telling you like I was telling you before, you seem so much more at peace with yourself. I had a bunch of come down a lot. I think it definitely helped. I had a bunch of life experiences, a bunch of, a bunch of psychedelic experiences to a bunch of. I'd be so afraid to do that shit. Yeah. Why? But because I'm a pushy registered, I've learned it. Uh, the psychedelics changed me a lot for sure. You know, it's just, it's hard to gain perspective. I'm not sure I've done them. I'm sure several times. It's not about bath salts as you don't even say that. Brian fucking. Somebody might hear that and it's some new fucked up drug they're selling. It's like a cousin to crystal meth and they can sell it, and what's even worse is that fake we'd that we'd. I've been reading all the shit lately about that fake weed, that synthetic, synthetic weed, how bad it is for you.

Speaker 5:          01:31:45       That was good about the part that you get is that you're getting it from an illegal place, which means hopefully it's not tainted in anything. I don't know why anybody would go to a really shady neighborhood and buy shit on for a drug dealer who may never see them again. Why would you trust that guy? Let me cut it. You gotta do what you gotta do it the cheapest price you gotta do what you got to pay when you're in a dance. One of them. It's one of those sayings that he can't argue with you gotta do what you gotTa do. It is what it is, like whatever it is, what it is, what else could it be and what it is. What else could it be? It can be a. You could be looking at it in a distorted way because they're saying what it is.

Speaker 5:          01:32:26       What it is, is you might be looking at it and some sort of a fucked up way to justify your position. I never expected an answer to that question. That was a rhetorical question. I appreciate the. I'm one of those guys. I don't let them off float out there. If you walk around a rhetorical one, that needs to be addressed in a very literal sense already. I was laughing about something last night about you was telling eleanor, but uh, I would, um, you know, he's so good at pool Joe that I, you know, it's really tough to beat and even the nine boy, what you can, can involve a lot of luck. And uh, I would start talking about Carlos just 10 years ago. Say I just to aggravate him and it's fucking stick with prop, you know, like he would get aggravated just looking for any kind of edge at the comedy store.

Speaker 5:          01:33:16       The other day I was there, somebody tore down the car and Cs pitcher and threatened the trash and I went out. I did it. I was like, fucking asshole is someone trying to impress you. Probably somebody wants you to be a boyfriend. Did you do stand up at the comedy store? I'm only allowed on friends and family. You know, like, like if there's a host site now, they'll let me. Do you do the belly room? No room or no army fight. It's like a three to five minutes. It's a great club. What a great old time club. Dominic, what's your favorite club in the country?

Speaker 5:          01:33:50       Probably that one in Columbus. As far as a, a neutral club, I mean, you know. Yeah, I mean I love the wildwood. When I do the wall would gig. Uh, it's really special to me because I'm from philly and while it's like the suburb of Philly that, you know, do you do helium? Yeah. Great Club. Yeah, that's a, that's another all time classic. I'm doing. Do you ever do captain Brian's? Did I ask you that? No ship. It's in Marco Island. So it's beautiful. It's a great gig. It looks like a b room, but they pay like a and a room and it's just fun. I mean, being on, you know, that kind of environment that Columbus, Ohio, by the way, funny button. That's my home club. Started up strips, a great guy. I also like Tampa, uh, and uh, the Hollywood improv. How many years? It wasn't a weeks a. are you on the road a year? I don't know, Joe. It's opened up from doing tv or not. You know, like when I was doing that judge show, uh, it was less, I would say at least half the time. What was that Judge Show? It was like, it was called Supreme Court, a comedy. It's actually coming back. It was on direct TV and it was fun, you know, it was, I'd love

Speaker 4:          01:34:57       you to do it because I'm the judge and it's real small claims cases and they people sign a contract that says they can't sue again in a real small claims court that I make the final decision. And I just told them, I says, you know, I don't really know much about the law. I said, I'm not fair. If it's a hot chick, you're going to win something. And you know, that's the way life is. You know, I did some exactly like that long time ago. They tried Merv Griffin tried to do it. It's called Rogan's law St. pilot for it before I ever did fear factor. Yeah. Didn't. They didn't do it though. They never. Would. You have comedians is the lawyers? Yeah. Yeah. No, not as lawyers. There's no comedians as a lawyers, but there's a wish I could remember their names. She had comics.

Speaker 4:          01:35:43       I see him around the Improv. I'm sorry, I'm blanking on his name. He was the bailiff and there was another call. We had hot chicks is the bail and. Oh really? And that's why your show worked in mind. Didn't even go past. We did three. We did three years in Moonee. Do something like that too when he was on my show a lot. Yeah. And He, I gotta say he really gave good energy. I really did. He was a pro. He really will. He really went out 100 percent, you know, it was fun. Know who was fucking hilarious. Was a little sandy, Andy kindler killers. He had me crying, laughing. Let's little nebbishy Jewish guy. He's walking around with these almost like woody Allen look, and he was funny and it's interesting to see because you could tell which comedians have improv chops and which guys are only funny behind the racked right way.

Speaker 4:          01:36:34       Sure. And I'll tell you who was really prepared to the point where it was like a lawyer was love. It's really. Oh, he went up against Kevin Pollak. Poor Kevin pollock. He was doing Adam Arkin impressions at Adam. Mr Alan, Alan, Alan Arkin. Yeah. I don't know. And he was doing impressions and these kids. I said, we got like 17 year old kids in here. They know what you're doing. Yeah. You know, it's like Joe Piscopo the three stooges. Now they're going to know them again because the movie. But then I go, first of all, you're not even doing like at least do shimp updated from curling. Now he's doing.

Speaker 4:          01:37:10       You understand what our audience is. So Kevin Pollak does Alan Arkin and love was just fucking hilarious. And he was really prepared and he was going. Kevin would go to say something. They would go silence, silence. You impotent, get Queer, alcoholic, faggot. Trillium's doing all this shit, you know, they, they bleep that out, but you know, just like anything he could think of to grit down. Yeah. It's funny though. So you're there for three years? Yeah. And it's only on directv. It was. Did it get on the Internet at all? Does anybody, anybody thinks on a website or. No? No, but we're going to do a podcast. I told you from the laugh factory. Who you going to do it with? Myself? Just you? Yeah. Well, unless anybody

Speaker 3:          01:37:56       else has available. Brian, you want to be in business with Brian? Brian actually does a whole string of podcasts. Your podcast studio at the Ice House. Did I do it with you? Yeah. You were at that point. I know your face, right? You already explained that. That xanax is a motherfucker. Yeah, I remember. Was that he? Was that today? Earlier today. This morning when we did the podcast. How many of those you take one half a day. Is that what you know? I'd take a three hips. Three apps in a day? Yeah. How long have you been doing that? I don't know. Five years. Wow. Ever since you left me, you son of a big difference. I don't know. I don't know what it's like not to take you to. Do you ever say, you know what, tomorrow I'm going to become a Vegan and start doing yoga and drink spring water. Go for morning jogs. Never wanting to just jump out the window.

Speaker 3:          01:38:49       No, I don't. I mean, when you, when you get ideas in your head of moderation, what is the, you know, you just go out of this. Probably can't be good for me. Let me just kick back a little. Stick around a little longer. Like what do you, what are you thinking of when you, when you go moderation? Uh, I think I only think that way when I'm hung over and then when I'm, when I'm normal, I feel invincible. Normal. What? I'm normal. I mean I just feel like I could drink and I know a little bit of booze and a little bit of Xanax just makes you feel great. You just feel on top of it. Well, yeah. I'm a little bit. Does a lot of booze. I never, I never, I was talking to an emergency room doctor and she told me that the Xanax that I take at the level I take, it is probably a placebo at this point.

Speaker 3:          01:39:37       Really? Well, she said because you know, you never, I never upped the dosage because I'm not that stupid, you know, and I don't want to get to a point I never got high on Xanax. Well, is that what you're supposed to do? You're supposed to continue to up the dosage? No, but I think if I were an addict in the sense of like being really addicted to the drug and the feeling of it would be normal to try and get higher. I think it's just a psychological thing that I think I needed to go back to sleep and I'll. Well when you hear about a guy's like rush limbaugh and he starts doing autopsies and you know, you hear about them doing 99 a day and you know, you know, you want to do that xanax every day and have a drink every day. Do you ever see that and go fuck.

Speaker 3:          01:40:14       Like how far away is that for when I'm doing. No, you're. You're maintaining. Maintaining. Yeah, very specific. Worry more about the booze. I mean like I'm not into like painkillers. Right? Or do you remember when I had an operation on my balls? What did you have done? Your balls? I had him. I'm a plastic surgery to have them reshaped and no, I had to make them look yummy. Dipped in chocolate. Now I had a called a spermatocele and it's a rupture of the sperm duck. So your bowl starts getting bigger. Oh, that's right. Yeah, I remember that. Yeah. You were at a lot of fucking pain. Yeah. But the thing that was interesting was I never took painkillers because if you moved

Speaker 5:          01:40:54       it really hurt. But what I did was I have sophie and I would split wine bottle of wine. I'd rather get high on alcohol then take Vicodin or something. So libraries. I'm not, you know, I'm not really like a drug addict except for one drug, but not like a guy that pops pills and fucking drinks like wildly. I, I'm very conservative attic. But you, you feel dependent on this experience, like having this experience every day being in that state? Yeah. Wow. But I don't feel bad about it. Yeah. I mean, I don't feel the need to correct you or give you any advice. You seem like a pretty resigned to it. I'm too scared to. You're scared of his, his, his Wisconsin complicated. With your comedy comedy in your way. I didn't get. I don't want to say my rapier wit turning on him. You to go after you too hard.

Speaker 5:          01:41:49       No, no, Nah. He needed just a beautiful. You did what you needed to do considering the circumstances, how he was behaving. He goes over the top for this show and a lot of people don't understand that. It's like half of it's fun. It's to play a fucking head wound victim. Like him being silly. He's like, plays a character. I'm playing a character. I'm just, I don't filter myself. Oh, you got to disagree with Joe. What do you get a kick out of this screen with the boss? He's not quite like that. When the camera's off. I felt that myself. Act Polite and sometimes he goes a little over the top. I'll just try trying. It's all coming from a good place. He's trying to get better at when to go over the top, but not to go over the top, you know, houses stand up. That was really good.

Speaker 5:          01:42:38       So bad. He's got some good jokes. He's got some good jokes. He's. If he wanted to and he dedicated himself to it, he can be a real professional problem as he's a lazy bitch. She went here. My Bob Hope joke. No, it's actually not a bad job at. Did you hear Bob Hope died today. Oh really? Yeah. They uh. Do you think they flew out his body to Iraq to entertain all the dead trips? I'm not sure that a wizard job. That's the old joe that's six years ago and at Columbus, Ohio funny. But when I got booed in Harrison, quit quit comedy for five years because what a relief. Damn it, you know, it's really hard to find them is. And this is not to depress you. Thirty seven. No matter what you do, no matter how much you work, you'll never be as good as it was joe or myself, and that's sad in a way.

Speaker 5:          01:43:27       Well, you could put your whole heart and so you could get writers and you'll just never have that natural gift. It's not sad because I don't want that. I don't know. You don't have a choice? No, no. I mean I, I do comedy for a different reason. I did call me because I think it's fun once in a while, but I don't obsess about it. Like I do it once a week. I'm good. I don't, it's just kind of. Because I do so much podcasting, I consider this like a different kind of comedy where instead of doing like 15 people at a comedy club, I'm doing 500,000 people, you know, on, on podcast. It is a kind of form of comedy. You know, I've heard people say that about posting on message boards, like Internet Comedians, just like text base Internet comedians. It is, there's, there's, you know, I'm using this template that hides in the corner underneath the hat.

Speaker 5:          01:44:11       So when bidding on stage to me it doesn't do anything for, I don't get a boner about it like, but I do like to be funny and silly and Tom's old school, he doesn't silly men in their late thirties, so like come up with this combined with old school. But he is, he's funny. He can be funny if you're funny. He's just a, he's, he his got the man boy market covered. Sweet. You know, it's, it's a, it's a market. It's out there. Bill burr attacked it recently. He was really upset about it and I, and, and, and I totally understand what he's saying, but I don't get what alternative comedy is to me because if you go to like the biggest alternative website, a special thing.com. They were talking about like Patton Oswald's, Sarah Silverman, Patton Oswald. Oswald is one of the best joke writers that I know, like that guy is fucking how lame live comedy is simply a way of saying comedy for us.

Speaker 5:          01:45:00       So to the people who couldn't get on with the regular place and the people they could, that they worshiped like Patton Oswald, who's great comedians. It's like, it's just comedy man. You know, the idea is that what Bursa that was so hilarious was that they took the fear out of comedy and they made it so everyone's ultra supportive and he go there and you can be like really awkward. And then he goes. Meanwhile we had to go through fucking bars. You know, the places that we did stand up, we were starting out and booed at and screened by drunks. Yeah. But do you believe if you're either funny or you're not? Yeah. So I believe that. Yeah. I used to believe that, but then I see people that were fucking terrible and they stuck with it and they figured it out. But they learn. You can get, you can get to a certain point on, on hard work, but there's a certain point you can't get to without talent. Yes. Maybe. I don't know. I would say yes, but I got dammit. I've seen people that I thought just absolutely sucked and they figured out how to be funny. There were a bad. Who's good? Who's the best on town? The comedian you've ever seen?

Speaker 5:          01:46:06       I have one. I don't want to say I don't want to hurt anybody's feelings. I tell you whose name me. Your three top comedians have excluded that you see working right now working today. Doug. Stan helps my favorite after that, doug standpoint. The only thing about doug is he like angry about something. Can't tell. Getting. Yeah, of course. I'm kidding. How dare you. Who else? Louis? Just sheer, sheer prolific amount of amazing. Just puts out a new hour every year. Whose stuff's great. I definitely have people that I like to see that don't really necessarily stand up

Speaker 3:          01:46:50       though. Maybe alternative like Don Barris if there's only three people that I watched at the comedy story is funny and everyone else I really don't watch. It's Don Barris, brody Stevens, Taylor, and do a headline set in Austin last year when I was there for a UFC. I didn't book a Gig. I went to see him at the, uh, what is the cap city? Just fucking great man. He was really funny. Norton killed any. It was so dirty that sometimes I feel like I have too many Dick Jokes and my act like what is wrong with me forever. And then I saw norton. It was an hour solid of non peak hour solid of his cock, one in someone's mouth and then I laughed. Naturally. Fun the entire time. Yeah, he's, he's great. Um, depaul is great. There's a lot of great comedians out there right now. Man. This is a great time for Kelly.

Speaker 3:          01:47:42       Robert Bird, Taj, Taj and natural. Amber has really prolific to constantly come up and new shit. Yeah, there's a lot of great guys. No, it's a great time for comedy. Comedy comes in waves because it was such a dearth of talent at the store for a long time. And you're, your group started up and. Yeah, when we came there in the nineties it was. You'd have these guys come up and they were terrible. There were people that were singing songs and they wouldn't even have a joke in it. It would just be like a really, like, like a fucking famous hit song and they would just sing it and yeah. Oh, you remember fucking what's his name? Barry diamond. He used to walk in and what does it welcome in Memphis? Memphis. He would go on stage singing and really singing it and then everybody will be waiting for it to be a joke.

Speaker 3:          01:48:32       I told you he threatened to kill me because he said I was stealing Zach because some bartender in San Francisco so that I was doing the deck. I brought them in one night to see me. I said, did you see anything? He goes, no, he. Because he had asked me to help him out or he bet he bad mouth me to the guys in Atlanta. Right. And I got no beef with Barry. And he said, well, if dom American headline, why can I. and these guys are friends of mine, so they call them up. Who is this fucking guy? I said, why would you badmouth me when you don't know who's, who's friends with who? He said, well, I'm sorry. Can you try and get me the GIG now? I go, no, I'm not going to help you. Now. Community is just so scrolling. I saw barry diamond the other day and I actually talked to him. We're going to do standup comedy store. I wasn't very good. I saw a girl, girl, chick, woman, to try to touch you or anything. Just me on the lips. We saw girl with Mary Lynn Rice Crop. Yeah. She was funny. That's Duncan's old girlfriend. She kicked him out and he had to live with me. He lived. He lived. He lived here months. Yeah. Lucky bastard. The nicest place he ever had his puppet stay outside. No, I kept a puppet in my room. I said, I keep the puppet. That's part of the deal. I went Dunkin's doing great.

Speaker 4:          01:49:48       He's fucking killing a man. We went on the road. We did Louisville together. He got a standing ovation. Every time we went on stage. It's crazy. It's because of this podcast. Oh, that's great. Yeah. If you do great on the podcast, it's fucking awesome for you. Unfortunately, because of this episode, your twitter numbers are probably going to drop really well. People are going to unfollow you and I shouldn't have gone into the xanax thing if we're going to feel bad for me. No, you're being honest. I think the way you're explaining it and describing it as you are, you're pretty logical about it.

Speaker 4:          01:50:21       I can't imagine not doing it. I'm in love with it. Without it. What was the feeling? What is, when you describe anxiety, how would you, uh, how would you categorize it? Like tap, like emotional tap, dance, just like jittery and always. Well, I don't, I never wait man. I never waited for the moment because I'd always take the pills. So when did they find on stage please don't not come because of this stage. You're super calm and smooth and that's where I feel at home. Oh, that's crazy. I don't feel wow. Imagine that for most people, getting onstage and public speaking is one of the most terrifying things. Joe. Honestly, I think my, my pulse goes down when I'm on stage. The only time in the last 15 years I was ever like a little bit anxious was Madison Square Garden would share because I was worried about the sound system and the people in the back nine here in me because I heard it was a little screwy and my sister got a little panicky about what about me on truth, I can't believe you get to go up in front of all these people and that kind of got into my head and I didn't want to look up at the banners and stuff of the Knicks and rangers and the history and the garden and thinking Ali Frazier.

Speaker 4:          01:51:36       Sinatra was there and the Beatles were there, whatever, and there's a lock up. I was fine, but I mean I did have a glass of wine and I didn't. I wanted to set to be over the first one. We did it two nights a second. It's so funny how relative, but it's because the next night if the second set, we were at the Pepsi Center in Denver, which is bigger than the garden and I thought, oh, it's good to be out of there. I'm so relaxed. I'm so relieved. Just the history of the garden fucked with you. Well, that's what it did. Yeah. I started letting it creep into my head. You are, you opened for Whitney Houston to. Yeah. That was not fun. It wasn't fun. Now, wouldn't he know? She never talked to me. She had bouncers around her and I say a prayer and I thought, Geez, I don't know if Jesus had 300 pound bouncers.

Speaker 4:          01:52:22       Think their mostly like fisherman who were kind of thin wafer. And her father was a great guy and he says, you know, I'm lucky to work on my daughter again. This is really going well. I says, well thank you. I'm thinking there's no way I'm working with her again. And she would come in late her and she was with Bobby Brown already. They come in one night. I'm on stage for 45 minutes at the sands killing and uh, and I told the audience and says, look, I gotta tell you something. She's not here. I don't want you to think because you're a good cook because I'm from Philly. And it was like Lennox city. And you know, a lot of them knew me already and I said, she's not here, I don't want to leave you in the dark. That's why I'm staying on stage. I'm not being self indulgent.

Speaker 4:          01:53:00       And they start cheering. No, I was really doing it for them. That's hilarious. Yeah. And then she finally came. But how long did he, how long did you stay on stage? 40 slash 40 slash 50 minutes on crowd work. No, I didn't do any. Well, was lucky that was philly though. A place where you could do that? It's Philly. Well, I mean the thing is you have to tell them if they were upset, you know, I would have gotten off. I mean, the only time I had trouble, uh, with a big crowd was in Dayton, Ohio, because they do, they really fucking hated me. They hated me so much. They came to Cleveland, the Boomi, he's serious, but they couldn't get. I see he's still here, but you still can't get good seats that were in the backbone. Me, they hated you so bad that came to place.

Speaker 4:          01:53:43       Here's what happened. Well, I mean they're probably coming it probably show fans coming to see her and then generally her crowd was so eclectic that it was easy to do stand up for it because she doesn't get like a rock and roll crowd. It's not like quiet riot or something. It's like, you know, she got people that push you want academy award. You got grandmothers with their granddaughters and transvestites. Yeah. People forget she won an academy award. She's also an emmy award. Bad Ass straight career. Yeah. But uh, so I'm up on stage and this girl starts screaming and the crowd was really good. Just go skirts, store, screaming, share, share. I go, you know, she'll be out in a little while. And then finally I lost my patient. I go, I said, first of all, she's not even here yet. She changed it and put her first eyelash one.

Speaker 4:          01:54:27       She's, there's a break. I said, what do you, who do you think? I am like the friend of the owner of the building. I said, I'm a comedian. I got to do share. I go, listen, you stupid son of a bitch. You think I'm gonna? I'm gonna lift up the curtain shoe to come out and sing for you fucking idiot. And then the crowds and then I went after her and I just started at one after another and then the crowd start booing. Well I got upset with me and I go, Hey, I'm sorry, but she's fucking annoying, you know, and that was my only really bad experience and it's pretty tough when you lose an arena. It ain't like we lose in 300 people at a comedy club and getting them back. When you lose an arena, like to let the. Well it's a real problem when no one wants to see you, then they're there to see some.

Speaker 4:          01:55:11       Let's see. She put me on the bill, which really made it classy. Wasn't like, you know, special guests or anything. It was like dom opening act. That's what happened to Kurt Fox recently with Charlie Sheen. Remember that? Watch the video. They gave him a chance. He a dick up there. They gave him a chance. No, I disagree. I watched it. They weren't yet. No, I'm saying that they weren't really dare to see him. They were, they were down, they gave him a chance, they gave him a chance and he didn't come with any jokes that that's not, that's not what happened in that situation. I think curt will admit to that he

Speaker 5:          01:55:44       just didn't work well when we had him on the podcast. A I sort of an ironic sense of humor and he's a. he's got a good delivery, but I think he requires a, an attentive audience. Yeah, but he also said on the podcast we had a death squad that that when he came out that the people didn't know what to expect and so he came out and just started doing comedy and people immediately when you came out, start going, who books with Ms Dot troubleshooting. That's a big difference. Yeah. Well that's him being a rookie in these. Yeah. Sheena. Some dudes just sitting there talking. That's what you were saying. That's him being a rookie. You have to address that. You're hired as a comedian to go on stage in front of Charlie Sheen and no one knows what the fuck is going on. This is the first show you guys have done and that's what happened. You got to go onstage and you go, you got to set them up. I don't know what the Fuck Charles is going to do it. I think there was one. I like Tennessee want to handle that or something like that, but it's really at this stage

Speaker 10:         01:56:33       who's here to say Charlie Sheen?

Speaker 5:          01:56:36       Yeah, I mean it's really bad if you're not on the bill. Yeah, it's very classy and we share was classy. You know stacy, the dame had Claire C and I think there was something else that like they were waiting. They were waiting for a long time and I was really late and I'm sure, I'm sure there's a lot of that, but you know, you've got to learn how to use. If you're going to open for a guy like that, you have to have some fucking rock solid material. Or what did he think was going to happen? Joe, what did you think was gonna happen when I was going to write an act that quickly? Well, that's what he wants to it. What do you want to do? And his brain comedians with them, I know Russell Peters did a couple of them. We did Toronto with them and a few other places I think as well.

Speaker 5:          01:57:15       And they would go up on stage and Russell would sit down with them and Charlie would interview. Yeah, Russell would interview Charlie. Oh, talk to them and then crack a bunch of jokes along the way and you know, Russell's great at that shit. So Russell, so fucking funny. He's a great guy, great guy. And he's a, you know, it's so funny. Every time I sit next to an Asian person, I mean I'm talking about Asia from Cambodia to Pakistan. I always asked him to in a Russell Peters, if we're forgetting to talk, if they asked me what I do and they all know, wow, talk about one continent to pick the. Get to watch your back Asia to. He sold out the o two arena, I think it was two nights in a row in London. That's what they did. The UFC do the UFC there, Russell.

Speaker 5:          01:57:59       That the coolest thing about him is that he constantly surprises me. Like he, he, there's this guy named polly, he's like this big twitter guy and he just gave them a chance like, hey, why don't you come out to Arizona? And then he did the same thing to a door guy who Jesus over at the comedy store just grabbed them, was like, hey, he was one of the guys that I came to a dead mouse. The studio that night he opened for him in Irvine. He brings a mitogen on the road with them too. Yeah. He just grabs people and it gives them chances a lot. Like just random guys. I know. It's really neat. Yeah. Russell is a real good dude. He's a real good dude. There's a lot of good people in comedy. You know, it's an interesting thing about comedians and becoming friends with a bunch of them and you know, it's like have to get the greatest

Speaker 4:          01:58:42       people to communicate with, you know, cracks me up when people don't know that we're really friends. Like they think we're in constant competition. My competition is with me trying to get better. It's like somebody said to me, I don't mean to offend you, but I really like Robin Williams. I said, well, you're allowed to. Like I said, what do you think somebody even said that about or about? You know, I just wanted to say I think he's funny. I don't mean to offend you. Offend me. I think he's funny too. I think he's great. I go, what do you think? I think I carry comedy on my back and it had there you insult me by liking another comedian. It'd be a lot of

Speaker 3:          01:59:14       pressure. Him. You've always been a supporter of comedians. You were always great. You gave me great advice when, when I was first coming up with the store. You always, always when somebody have a good set, you would always be like really a complimentary and you know, talk to them about what you really liked. Some communities I'll do that shit. So committees, they never good. Never go up to a young guy and give him props. I mean I'd love to fucking. And

Speaker 4:          01:59:40       when you did that, when Joe, your face, when you did new rules are and of course Mary Joe is one of the funniest, I swear to God, your neck got longer. That was a bid that we, new rules

Speaker 3:          01:59:52       can not work and eat it and kill. And that was a bit. It took a long time. I remember coming up and telling you that because it me, I was fucking crying. New rules. The 90 year old that I had to work. I worked on that bid for a fucking year. That was one of those bits that just, I just kept tweaking it. I could never get it right. Yeah. No, I just, I knew there was something in this just like my diamonds size. But Damn, you only opened up with it today. You're going to be fine. What do you got? Their fellow? Yeah, I want to. Energy drinks. Yeah. We're going to wrap this thing up. So it's almost two hours in. So where are you going to be next time? I'll be at the hilarity next week and then two weeks I'll be. Was it 25th? I think captain. Brian's 25th, 26th and you're on twitter. Dom Irrera I r e r r a on twitter. She was really nice meeting you, Tom. We already knew each other. It was nice hanging out with you. Oh, okay. Good. Does anybody have any more xanax before we go? Do you feel weird about revealing that to the world? No, I don't know. You don't care? I don't give a fuck.

Speaker 4:          02:01:01       That's the only. The only thing. The only reason I would like to be gay is just to come out.

Speaker 11:         02:01:09       They don't give a fuck,

Speaker 4:          02:01:10       but I mean I'm not gay because I like women so much but it would be like I was thinking about it even at this point, the way I look now and this is what's great about show business and you know, is that I couldn't be gay if I wanted to because I couldn't ever get guys as good looking as the girls like it because guys are more superficial and into. But you can get girls because they like talent and money. No. So anyway, the guy who, the guy who got thrown back into the closet, we don't need you out here. That's funny.

Speaker 3:          02:01:40       I would like to be gay just so I can come out just so you can say it. You don't give a fuck where you surprised when Kevin, me and he came out. It was like in his fifties show how many per. There's only a certain amount. There's only a certain amount of show tunes you can sing. Not Be gay. I was surprised with todd glass. I was as well. You weren't surprised but I have a thing on my phone of tagless talking to me. They'll let you hear drunk. No, no, no. He, I offended him and he called to reconcile it and the Florida radio station called me to bust his balls and I didn't realize what I was saying was. And I like todd. I would never want to hurt him, but I was saying that he says you never thought I was funny, didn't you?

Speaker 3:          02:02:27       I said I always thought you were funny. I mean not like laugh out loud. Funny. But you know, like he never going to go in and see it to go. My stomach hurts. But you know, you were funny. I mean you liked these, the Tuesday, Wednesday and Sunday headliner, you know, and I didn't know it but that's what he was doing that weekend. I was crushing him and he's a very sensitive guy and if he hears just be, here's this. I love him. But I was just joking around. They didn't know I was hitting on some pumps, sore points, you know, todd glass called me up after them and see if things somehow or another we got on the phone together and he was one, oh, like, you know, a lot of comedians were happy after that went down. But todd and I really didn't know each other very well and he was so enthusiastic and happy and he just said thank you.

Speaker 3:          02:03:13       Thank you. Just thank you for doing it. And he dropped to his knees. I'm glad now in retrospect that I didn't give a big long hug and both of my parents are retired and go crazy. Both of my parents are care, gay recharge. But, you know, there was a few people that were fascinated by it, but he was super thankful and I talked with, you know, um, kindler and I briefly said, you know, we're like maybe there should be some sort of a fucking comedians union, you know, it shouldn't be a union. They tried it, they tried it in New York with the was. But that was about like pay at the clubs, right? Is that what it was about? No, no, it was past that it was about a health insurance and joining a unionized. But it's tough when everybody's in competition with each other for, for jobs.

Speaker 3:          02:04:01       I think the only place it would work is if you know, when you have to get rid of fees that, that, that is when having comedians together, like people don't understand the issue behind thievery. And that's why there was a lot of people that thought that what I did was really douchey and when we released that Carlos video, but when you have someone who is being unchecked and they're doing well and they're just running through the comedy world, like people don't understand what that's like. It's like you're working with someone who just might steal your car and no one else that you work with is going to do shit about it. The guy just going to steal your car. I mean, really that what it's like a joke is actually worth more than A. Hey, how about this? How about Bob Hope Joke. We're at the fucking.

Speaker 3:          02:04:41       We're at the, uh, word, the Jerry's Deli today. He launched into chick came over and quoted one of your jokes. I mean, think about that joke. That's a fucking 15, 20 year old joke, right? Let me think about how much that's worth, that's worth more than a car to somebody could just get exhausted. Hospital happened and what we're reading so someone could just gag that. They could just steal that right in front of you. And we had like a real problem with. We've got a problem with a couple of guys at the store when you watched that shit happen and you know, you've seen it all. We've all seen it happen several times throughout our career. A guy who comes along, it's just a fucking buccaneer who just grabbing them from all over the place and nobody wants to do anything about it. That's the time where I think something like a comedy union would help, you know, we, we could all get together and just all of us unanimously say, Ladies and gentlemen of the audience, you people out there that, that paint see, stand up comedy.

Speaker 3:          02:05:32       This guy's a fucking thief and this is just what it is. Signed by Rera, Tim Allen, blah, blah blah. You know what I say to an obscure reference to pull out the will of people I never even heard you mentioned him and I think I left and I never have met him once. He was a nice guy, very nice guy. Went on stage at the comedy store is doing a joke about his Ferrari breaking down. That's something everybody can relate to her. Yeah. It pissed me off because I had to drive my mazur roddy that day and I hate that it was sticking it in your face. Dom Dom had a cadillac once where he put a vinyl roof on it. You know, when you get one of those nice smushy roofs, it might have been one of the last ones made in America. Like you have the cabinet in the.

Speaker 3:          02:06:17       You had the roof put on. I remember you like, I think I'm going to get a nice soft is such a fucking awesome Guinea move and I, I, I embrace so many things Guinea. But I thought it was hilarious that you were doing that. I was like, Yay, go for it. I want to get a pinky ring to fucking boom. Bada boom by each other. You know, you, you and you went and you got it done. Yeah. That he had a nice cadillac and yet the back end. You had a nice a vinyl roof put on like this. It looks classier. Remember when cars had those brawls at the front that you used to be a big super close super leather, but borrow. A friend of mine had an a Mazda rx seven. One of the fucking cool years, like with the flip up headlights and shit and he had abroad.

Speaker 3:          02:07:04       I was like, that might be the dopest cowell time. Mazda had a hell of a car in that rx seven to like one of the last models right around the time where accurate came out with the NSX around that other and Toyota came out with the supra is you're not in the cards. John Merera doesn't even have a navigation system. How about that? Well, I tell them I wouldn't be able to figure it out anyway. You're burning it up and so reduce. Susie has the navigation. Then he used to have as far as like you have. I mean my God, they're incredible and I'm fucking terrorize being with driving around. You go from point a to point B in 60 minutes. It's unbelievable and I was getting like jeeves from getting thrown back, but I tried to act normal heads hitting the thing, but the most cathartic thing about this whole experience was I finally got to tell you, I was afraid of the pimples.

Speaker 3:          02:07:55       I told you without reason, I never wanted you to think and I never had the heart to tell you that I didn't want to come to your house. Not a pushy person. No, but I mean, you know, there's always a need coming into Hollywood shooting pool with me. There was no. It's nice to get that off my chest. Just finally admitted that even that they were shooting and those doors were just walking around. Just solid muscle and teeth. Fucking jaws of death. Ernest sweeties. I believe that, but there's always that. One time I will wait to meet Johnny cash. Johnny cash is my master. He's a sweetheart. Oh, he's outside. He's nice dog. He's way bigger than the pimples, so maybe I met him another time blocking you. That's a big dog. I made them another. He's so strong. It's ridiculous. I've never had a dog that's as strong as him.

Speaker 3:          02:08:39       It's a dog where you read. Like if he lunges for something, I got a drop down and dig in with both my feet and hang on a horse. See, here's the problem. He's going to know I'm afraid of him. No, he's a sweetheart. But he knows. They sense it. Yeah, but trust me, he's going to go right from my mastiffs is they're very confident because they're not worried about you at all masters and never worried about a person beating their ass. They just the headmasters, because they're so confident, they're so big and so strong. They are very nice, like they don't. They're not insecure. Like there's certain certain dogs that feel like they have to establish dominance over person or scare a person. Mastiffs. They're not like that. If they're barking at you, it's real. If a massive is angry at you and barking, you better realize you gotta fucking real problem because a dog that's that big.

Speaker 3:          02:09:27       You're talking about 150 to 200 pound dog. Do you know how strong that fucking let those dogs and with the kids. Of course, yeah, we play with the kids, but that I'm sure enough to have them around kids. If you can't trust the dog around kids, you can't have that dog. My Dog's exhibit. No aggression. You have two masters? No. The other one's a bulldog mix. He's a very lazy dog, but he's a sweetheart too. They're both real nice dogs, man. Joe, do you know anything about the Honda Crx z? Is that that a hybrid thing? Hybrid. I saw one the other day and it was amazing. It looked like a spaceship go. Have you seen what they're doing now in a car? They're putting stitcher in a gang of cars. Going to be in BMW's. BMW's. It's forward. It's a all the big guys and now they also have three g on here and like, like I said the other day, this new ipad has the four g light on it. Verizon, yeah. It's faster than my business clash. A charter at my studio. That's incredible. I've got four G, a car that I put in my laptop. I'm pretty happy with it. When you actually get a four g connection on the road. It's a little sketchy though, but it's always better than the shit that's in the hotel room if you've seen. Well,

Speaker 1:          02:10:34       first of all, let's talk about their fucking virus that we both thought we got. Yeah, so don't know. It's the flashback virus. If you're using a Mac and you think that you can't get a Trojan, it's not really a virus. It's a Trojan. It's an exploit through Java and it's a guess. It only works if you don't have your Java updated to the latest and greatest.

Speaker 7:          02:10:52       Yeah. If you. If you're one of those people that keep your shit updated, you, you're really not going to have to worry about it. That though. I wouldn't say that. Also, it's also it's, it's only if you go to some really sketchy website, the more I read about it and also just a way to test it to see if you have it and I tested mine and I go to the filthiest fucking places in the world and I didn't have it. I mean I did look at torrent websites. What do you do? You open up terminal and you have to cut and paste this. A couple of different lines of code in it. The easiest way to to actually figure it out. If you go to a nine to five.com, our Mac nine to five.com. What is that website, right Mac? Nine to five. It was if you just googled Mac virus will come up with a couple pages and there's links to the code that you cut and paste into your browser and it's a nine to five Mac.com is the one that I saw at on and it's pretty much you just type in these codes and if you don't, if it, it tells you what to look for and what not to look for to tell you if you have it.

Speaker 7:          02:11:51       But you know, honestly, the only thing you really have to do is just open up your little apple on the left hand corner, hit, uh, hit it and then go to system update and there's a Java update, uh, in that if you have that, we'll patch it. And if it's not in there already, I mean check to make sure you have it. Then you must have already done some people say you shouldn't have Java on your browser. You should enabled the problem. The problem is is yeah, well when you go to any kind of, when you first get your laptop, when you first get your Mac, that's the one of the first things that comes up. It's like, would you like to Install Java? Like is not a part of the operating system is not a part of windows. It's a third party thing that you add to your browser.

Speaker 7:          02:12:28       Pretty much. So it's a plugin. Like I just had it turned off on this laptop over here and I tried to go to that Honda website and it didn't work. The Honda website didn't work because I didn't have a job enabled so I enabled it. Now it works. I checked the, this laptop and his Mac or this Imac. You updated it last night. So it's everything's cool and it's. If you're looking at. If you go to nine to five Mac.com and you look at the map that, that like who's infected, you know there is a lot of people infected but this is, we're talking about rural to Ra worldwide. Will did. Rolled Don verus say that he had someone, Don dot Mary's had a meltdown last night on the stage because he had his facebook hacked and his gmail hack. So then he went in there and changed all this shit and then they hacked it again and he pretty much on stage was like, you know what I give up.

Speaker 7:          02:13:20       I'm not putting my, I'm not doing any more podcasts anymore. I'm not, I'm done with this Dingdong shut. Like it really freaked him out that people. These are the freaking mountain dom. You Got Xanax farm. Well it's, it's, it's the point that I mean like, like we were talking about this the other day. So if a, if an ex girlfriend finds your cell phone and looks through your cell phone, that scary sometimes like you don't know what you fucking say to your friends are like, you know, like, do you should've just kidding. Maybe not. Yeah. Oh well it's like a I, if I ever die, my parents find my fucking laptop and they have to go through it and sort of. That's the most scary shit ever. My Mom's gonna be like, what's wrong, Brian? And then it can't be like, mom. No, I downloaded those for photoshop so I could put joe's face on it and it's an honest message board.

Speaker 7:          02:14:06       You know what I mean? Like choke pitchers are really into black day. Yeah, exactly. I think of that when I'm jerking off on the couch and there's porns leapt out if I died, like who would walk in and see what, you know, how perverted they aren't. Yeah, exactly. So now imagine, imagine the whole Internet being able to do that to your computer, not your mom, not your fucking girlfriend. Looking at your phone. Now imagine the whole Internet being able to access your computer. That's fucking terrifying. It was terrifying. Yeah, it's going to happen. I really think that, you know, we talked about, uh, with everlast the other day, we're like secrets or on the way out at a certain point in time, everything you do online, someone's going to be able to read it. Someone's going to be able to listen to your phone calls are going to be able to access.

Speaker 7:          02:14:49       That's what I said last night. I was like, Joe, you know, there's like at least seven people in New Zealand right now listening to this phone call that are ahead of us in technology that can. It's probably boring tiger woods with a great example, like when I was a kid, baseball players, they'll cheat on their wives, but the sports writers knew what they didn't. They didn't rat him out. But today's world, you know, they traced down everything. Yeah. You know, and he wouldn't, he wouldn't even been in trouble. What Michael Jordan probably did is, you know, double that. I mean Michael Jordan in his prime goddamn tornado sweeping white women through the air like semis. Could you see that? A video footage of Dallas, the fucking tornado hitting Dallas and semis were flying through the air like paper Dom 18 wheelers full 18. We're lose 30, 40, 50 feet in the air, just spinning in circles.

Speaker 7:          02:15:38       It's fucking crazy. It's crazy. It's really weird to watch, man. I would highly recommend. Now, uh, this is something that I'm personally going to start doing, is to take your fucking computer and empty it all out onto external hard drives. And then unplug those external hard drives from your computer and only use them when you need to or make him. Yeah, but I mean it only takes it like if, if people are hacking Max and people are doing this shit now they feel like wiki leaks and all this fucking crazy shit. If you really want to fucking protect these woody, the government. Well I mean I think hackers are way above what we know that they are. You know, I think people are downloading fucking large amounts of information about anyone. I think there's fucking message boards that people probably go, all right, who should we look at their computer today? Oh, let's go to a seat. Steven Seagal is, let's see this new thing on the

Speaker 3:          02:16:30       cover of wired. This month's wired about the NSA building, like the most incredible security spying computer system ever where they're going to be able to literally keep a data record of every phone call you make every text you send, every, every phone call to get out. I mean, could you just stop and imagine that the, the, the ability to record every single phone call that gets made throughout the entire country all the time. Well doesn't like when we, when the Dell is a dell, there's a big computer somewhere that has all these information on it for years. And then finally it gets thrown out. Like everything we did, everything we did on the computer is stored somewhere. That's what I've heard.

Speaker 3:          02:17:16       I have no. I have no backup. Guys would agree with Newton cars. Brian, you're getting so bored with this podcast, by the way. Now I'm doing Cleveland, let's say, and it's long doing Cleveland this week. Oh, this week. I'm kidding. Next week. They're cheap too. Not saying it's long. I get it. That was a joke. Yeah.
