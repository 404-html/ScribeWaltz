Speaker 1:          00:00:08       Experience. Nicholas, me, boy, Joey, boy. We've known each other for many decades and now we're both wear reading glasses. Look at this ladies and gentlemen, fucking irritate fucking old men. We can't see up close. So sad. Did you notice when you came in? I ripped mine off like you were abroad. It's like one of those things. If someone calls, you know and you're sleeping, you always lie about it and it's like, what do you need those nod to him? Don't need those. I only use those for numbers. I'm in the restaurant. I have to wait, just hold on the menu. She's 11 and 11 feet from my table so I can read. Yeah, in low light conditions and less. I have my camera on my, my phone with the flashlight, you know, so I can use, I could read it if I have my, but otherwise I don't know what the fuck at the bill is.

Speaker 1:          00:00:55       You need to step up the bifocals so you can wear them all day long and I'll be going, I don't need them past like my arm's length. It's, that's right. My friend Steve Graham explained it to me. He's an ophthalmologist. I guess when you get older, your, your, your eyes just lose their ability to focus up close and then this shit doesn't help. Computers don't know. It's the worst pawn on your cell phone at three in the morning. That's not what I'm talking about. I'm talking about work. I don't know a year. No, no. You're talking Nick Depaulo. How dare you. Apparently you're doing a lot more than I am. Joe. Uh, you went back to New York, Huh? Yeah. How long ago did you go back? I was out here. Oh, Christ. I was out here from 95 to 99. And you were like enough for think Chris rock called.

Speaker 1:          00:01:34       Yeah, I had it not, I swear to God, this is a true story. I was in my own shower at my house arguing with an imaginary fucking age and I didn't have, I'm not fine. I swear to God my wife heard me in this house, be right, did and I'm like, I'm fucking losing my mind out here. And then like a bolt from God. Chris rock called. He started his HBO show and said, I want you to be one of the writers, and I was like, you gotta be shitting me. I was on the fucking next plane out looking, looking down at all the bridges. I burned in La. You could see the fires from nick played my brother on news radio. There was a, there was a, I want to say it was a confusion, but it would be a lie. It was an agent tried to fuck him.

Speaker 1:          00:02:18       A casting agent tried to fuck them over. We had already booked him for the part and all the sudden this casting agent goes, oh, I've already booked that. I've got this guy coming in and I go, what are you talking about? I go, it's supposed to be Nick Depaulo. He's my friend. He's going to be my brother. My other friend Brian counts, my other brother. It's already booked. She goes, well, I don't know what to do. You know I've already got this guy books, so you're going to have to tell nick. Oh No, no, no. I get near this to tell this fucking other guy because she had already called you and told you you didn't. That's right. She came out and said, uh, you guys can go whatever. She tried to weasel casting female casting agents in many circumstances are a lot like male casting agents.

Speaker 1:          00:02:58       You know the casting couch, the notorious casting couch. Yes. How bad you want it. The part and you know, well this, this gal had a male friends and these male friends, uh, apparently, uh, she, she enjoyed their company and so she would, uh, get them gigs even if those gigs weren't really available. And that was what was going on. And she was just going to weasel this guy. Yeah. Yeah. And I was walking to my car and you came running out and go, hey, hey, hey. I go, what? And then I felt bad. I'm like, now did I just fuck somebody over? Cause I know Joe. No you didn't fuck anybody. You were already, that was a stellar after you were outstanding, but you were approved and done. It was over. But she just tried to weasel it in. It was fucking gross. Oh, oh, it was that Horace name.

Speaker 1:          00:03:44       Oh, no need. No need to name names and who it might not. She might have been on medication. Who knows what the fuck. That was a fun episode that we beat the shit out of each other through each other through windows three Stojich and we did a scene, we actually did a scene that it said was, it came across to violent Joe and Brian at it. Remember what the coffee, we had a glass coffee pot or I hit you over the head and smashed me over the head and then we kick and jellies down and they said it looked too much. They actually said it looked too much like Goodfellas. Dinero was kicking a guy. Remember he had the, so uh, it was it last week. I got to break this thing off. He had like five times. Yeah. I got to fly through a glass window.

Speaker 1:          00:04:22       You know, they have that candy glass. So I went flying through a window. It was fun, man. That was a fun episode. And you know who Epstein from from welcome back. Kotter Epstein from welcome back. Kotter was our oldest brother who was a priest that we were all terrified of his, I think he's dead too, isn't he? Did he pass away? No. Kiddin what was his name? He's got a Dutch team from welcome back. Guys are going to be born then. Yeah. Um, I didn't know he died. Did he really die either? Either that or I'm stunning, ugly grow right now, but I, I, I realize this might have jack died now you will hope in horse shit. Don't confuse your hopes that you went, oh wait a minute. You know what? You're right. Is it, is it Horshack he and the Black Guy, I think they're all bad actually Gabe, cause you know who else died?

Speaker 1:          00:05:08       The wife died. Oh, he died in 2000 wife died. You were right. He died in 2012 he did. You know, maybe he's from that episode was a lot of violence going. Wow. He looked like shit before he died. What the fuck, man, when we knew that's him, that's him. That's Robert Hedges. When we knew him, he actually looked pretty good. It looks like a candy Crowley from CNN. Some of those guys that get a really good gig like a welcome back Connor. And then after that it dies. Those fucking guys never recover. It's like they're living the fucking life there. Yeah. Nice bagels from craft service. Everybody. Good Morning Mr Hedges. How are you sir? Get your coffee. Would you like something? And then uh, this fucking cruel machine just spits them out. It's a hard fun. And then you want home. I, yeah. When did he turn into a Hawaiian woman before he died?

Speaker 2:          00:05:58       What the fuck? Who Does he look early from? Loss. You know what happened? He probably went all spiritual. Look at all the necklaces and stuff he's wearing. You probably went all spiritual. Probably it was all going downhill or maybe he had cancer or something. Maybe now I feel bad. He was a dude, man. He was, and he knew that that was like a thrill to meet the guy died of a heart. Yeah, it was. We were kids when that show was, you died of a heart attack, 60 years old. And I think I know the woman, the wife, the played the wife and that showed just died of cancer. Well I'm the Cape Chaplain's wife on the show. She just died recently. Meanwhile, John Travolta looking great, sucking cock all over the planet. Apparently it's how you get rhythmic. Well he definitely doesn't look ripped anymore. No, you're right.

Speaker 2:          00:06:45       He's Kinda Kinda, yeah. Who looks the best from that? Well him, he looks the best from that show. I want the black guy that played Washington cause he's still around. Freddy. Boom, boom. Washington. Yes. Hills. We are dating ourselves, but it's relevant because they're dead and we're getting close to it. Nobody knows who they are anymore. That's what's fucked up. No, I know. Let's talk about, let's find the guy, if they just did a loss, reference it. I've never seen the show you never saw last. No. This is the first network gave a really good, I rewatched it. Joe's way better if you know what happened because now you're only focusing on what you're really supposed to be focusing on. Not The bullshit that makes you hate this show. But here's that picture of Freddy. Boom, boom, Freddy, boom. Is he still alive? Lawrence Hilton. Jacobs is his name.

Speaker 2:          00:07:31       Yeah, it looks good. Yeah. He's, he's the best looking guy at all of them now. And Horshack checkout. I think you're right. He seemed shocked is done. I think you're right. I think horse sharks debt. Let's say that shows kind of Jenks now the you'd think of not really. It's just life. Well, they're not that. Hello. It's just what's true, which is like, yeah, he died in 2012, two same year that, uh, Epstein died. And Gabe cod, who's a like degenerate gambler. Is he a degenerate? Well, that's what I heard. I know he's a poker player and maybe I'm stretching the, those two are kind of synonymous. Club owner told me that. Did you ever do that? Kj Rentals in Orland Park, Illinois, a guy named Kenny round? No, never does. He used to have Gabe cod are in there and uh, gave copies to hate going to bring this stuff to the airport and our luggage and had hate to check it.

Speaker 2:          00:08:22       He used to mail it, spend like three, $300 a mailing. It's closed really. And he went and he, this guy took him out gambling and some casino. Um, he was there the weekend before I was any, any, uh, he won. Like he won, like he said, 750,000 betting on football. And I said, you mean 75 that he goes, no, 750,000. This guy, Kenny wouldn't lie either. Uh, but he, this guy, he was like, he's like a heavy intuit. When you start getting to those big numbers, that's fucking dangerous because it can all go away like that. Well, I'm going to pool,

Speaker 1:          00:08:56       I put $5 on the beginning of the year and I'm trying to beat my niece, Jenna. That's helping. That's helping. I mean, is it gambling is fun, don't get me wrong. But the thing about gambling is that like, you got to keep pushing the stakes to keep up in that thrill, to try juicing. Your veins are already lang used to, he used to go hard and oh my God, he told me some of the num and in a norm norm is the worst, right norm. Norm Macdonald's supposed to be like the worst of all time. Oh my God. It's like again so bad. I couldn't get on his podcast this week.

Speaker 1:          00:09:32       What kind of numbers? Well I already told me story about norm and he says it's absolutely true that he won. He won like 60 grand one night and he walked out. Uh, where would they gambling? What the hell was it? It wasn't Vegas cause it was, there was an ocean nearby. Any throw all the money in the ocean cause he knew he was going to Piss it away anyways. Why? That's yeah, that's what I already told me. I wouldn't, I wouldn't doubt that. I wouldn't need that. You know, norm telling my legit crazy. We were, we were having a great time on a plane once and just randomly sat next to each other. It's just total dumb luck. Had a great time. Lino three hour flight laughing and cracking up and talking to all kinds of shit. He's like, wow. Yeah. I quit smoking a long time ago.

Speaker 1:          00:10:16       I'm just so happy. I quit smoking and then as he lands, he goes, spa, I want a cigarette. He walked right into the fucking, one of those duty free shops at the airport, bought cigarettes and it just couldn't have them in his hand. As he was walking out the door and lighting them, couldn't wait to get out the door to light him. I go, what happened to Quintin cigarettes? He goes, I quit Quintin. I just wanted a cigarette. It was so great. I mean, just an hour ago talking about how much he's happy. He quit cigarettes. He quit a long time ago and then this switch goes off and he just impulsively decides time to have a cigarette. I go to his hotel and he's in New York. A few years ago, I had a bunch of sets at night. It's like two in the morning and he tells me to come up to his hotel.

Speaker 1:          00:10:59       He's drinking black coffee by the pot. He drank. Like I took pots in front of me and I can hear her stomach gargling cause he had, he had some stomach problems he says, and I can hear him make any songs and he's just too full pots and I go, what? He didn't do stay up for three day night. I'm immune to it and it doesn't even bother me, Eh. Some guys can just drink coffee like Tate Tate and drink coffee and go to sleep. My friend who owns caveman coffee, people become immune to this year. He drinks coffee and then you can pass out. I don't, I'm like a little puss. I have a half a cup but I'm all over the place like a fucking meth addict. It's one of those things if you do it a lot, if you drink a lot of coffee it sort of becomes normal. But if you, if you take a few months off a coffee and then you realize what a drug caffeine really is. I actually have a bit on my album. It was a good segue. I knew one nick dip. Yeah, Nick Dip Com. You can get it. By the way. What's the name of the [inaudible]? Another senseless killing. Another senseless killing. But uh, I have a caffeine bid on there because I'm like hyper.

Speaker 2:          00:11:54       I get fucking like, I'm also allergic to it. You're what? I'm almost like allergic to it. If I have most alert, I have a couple of cups. No, I, I can't even like focus. Really? Yeah. So it's an unusual feeling that you get. Yeah. I don't, uh, has this always been the case? No. No. This is a recent, yeah, it's like the eyes. Yeah. Oh yeah. It's deliver. No, it is Joe. The immune system can't even fight out of caffeine. Now we're going, we're going like fucking Horshack. We can we play that enough caffeine clap. Yeah. Yeah. Here, let's play it.

Speaker 3:          00:12:29       Caffeine. Here we go.

Speaker 4:          00:12:32       That's a great setup. Negative guy. Have a caffeine problem. Just found that out. I like, I mean, I'm almost allergic caffeine. I was laying in bed the other night thinking, how come I've been in like 12 fist fights before noon time over the last 20 years. I'm like hyper alert. You guys have a couple cups of coffee, you get a little jittery. It's like bath salts for me. I'll show you fucking face off and leave you in the street.

Speaker 3:          00:12:55       I go to Dunkin donuts. An hour later I'm naked in my driveway. Restaurant. Three cops. Tasering my balls. What's he on? Angel Dust. No, I had a Cappuccino with three sugars. Get back in your car. I'll fucking true your nose,

Speaker 4:          00:13:09       but I get really nasty as opposed to by natural state. I've had some of the worst fight to my wife and I was jacked up on coffee. Last January. True Story. It's a Sunday morning. My wife comes down the stairs. She goes, uh, my nieces and nephews are coming over. We're going to a petting zoo and you're coming with us and I'm like, I've been following the Patriots for 16 weeks. Today's the first playoff game. But yeah. What better time to look? Got a gold Lang is on shit.

Speaker 3:          00:13:33       Was it an accident?

Speaker 4:          00:13:39       Cut to me were like half hour later I'm in a bar and looking at animals. I have like a pot of coffee and my gut. I'm crawling out of my skin. This guy next to me goes to me the most condescending. Tony goes, that's a Yak.

Speaker 3:          00:13:53       I go, yeah, I know what to fucking act as a sign but on the cage and it had a read asshole and then I realized he was talking to his four year old son on the other side of it. Is that not a classic caffeine? How do you get out of that one? I just stayed in the asshole role, went till the next cage and it was a goat in there. I just looked at him. I went, let me guess duck. What is that? A pigeon come on Doctor Sushi. No fucking everything. What does that right. Even as a little kid was looking up at me like, who pissed in your cheerios mister? And I'm like, fuck you, you little pussy. I for a Pumpkin at him. My wife pushed me out of the bag. What'd you record

Speaker 4:          00:14:31       this? Keep? There's what? Go ahead. There's one more. One more caffeine story. This was about a month and a half later, White Plains airport sit next to this obese guy for like two hours ignoring his smell. He hadn't said a word to each other. All of a sudden he gets up, he looks at me and this tone of voice, he goes, I'm going to the shitter. Watch my bag.

Speaker 3:          00:14:49       That's totally am I caught on. I get bags are not gonna explode in 30 seconds. He goes, well, look like a terrorist. I go, that depends. He goes, depends on where to go. If I was a cheeseburger, I was a fresh garden salad. I feel very comfortable watching your bags in the next 20 minutes or a pack of sweet low, but you're like butter. Let's be honest, and that's it.

Speaker 1:          00:15:13       I did that at acme. Oh yeah, that's a great club. My favorite club, it's a great club. It's a low ceiling and it's, I say, I think it was like 270 people. Yeah, there's like five of those type of clubs like helium, comedy works, you know all those like low ceiling, tight, tight clubs. Joe is his Denver like that. I haven't been in the comedy works in you. God. It's the best I know. I get kicked out of the rap to, to some Bachelorette party, ruin my fucking shell. The second time I was there and I called him fat conch and the girl who ran the place was of that gun. So she didn't like that. Oh, how dare you. I hope you still not running it. She, of course she owns it now. Well, I don't think it was Wendy. Really? How long? Just had to be 18 years ago.

Speaker 1:          00:15:59       Oh, it was probably one day a rally. She's on morning. I apologize. She couldn't have been on it and get then. All right. Yeah. She owned it from the start. Oh. Cause she wasn't there. Now the owners are never even on their charge back then. And then she got like Tommy things done and while she stapled Yam, she went with the, you know, they do those things well, it's no need. It's still no reason to let a bad truck party ruin my shot. I hear yelling with you. That's what you did yours, right? Yeah, yeah. Killer. Right. I love that place. Yeah. It did my uh, rocky mountain high or the last one, my comedy central special. I decided I'm doing them all from now on in clubs. Yeah. I I did, uh, the last one I did, Ron nerve was in at comics w which is a club, but it was like we squeezed like 500 people in there and um, you know, people do these big theaters and they start to all sound alike or like kind of cookie cutter.

Speaker 1:          00:16:50       You don't capture that, that energy that I think you could get away with a theater. I mean, uh, I did a talk in monkey's in space. My next set, my second favorite one that was in a theater in Columbus. Nice little theater though. I like a 900 seats. Oh, that's perfect. Yeah. But I think the, once you go to like 2000, 3000, it's you, you lose a bit of the interaction with the crowd. Yeah. There you are. An acme. That's a fucking club. That's a great club. Those classic low ceiling clubs. That's, that's why your comedy is hypnotic. Like everyone gets roped into your energy mindset. Energy stays right in your face. You do ride it and they write it. And it's also like, I feel like, um, when you're, you, you, you don't miss any of the tags. You don't miss any of the, I didn't, have you ever sat in the crowd at a theater before?

Speaker 1:          00:17:39       Uh, just to add a Letterman tape and when I first moved to New York, yeah. But that's different, right? Because that's like not a standard. No, I went to a, I was in New Jersey and Joey and I, Joey Diaz and I, we're, we're doing Friday night and a Lewis Black was there on Thursday night. So we had gotten there early. We flew in, we said, well, let's go say hi to Louis. We'll sit in the audience. So we went and sat in the audience and he would get a big laugh and then he would have a tag line. Nobody couldn't hear the tagline. And I was like, oh, you can't hear out here because everyone's laughing. There was too many people like around you that were laughing and the sound just didn't penetrate to that. How big that was that then 22 lines, 2,400 something like that. I'll never get any of that unfortunately know it's a little larger.

Speaker 1:          00:18:21       That's my goal to make a bad specialty in front of 2100 people. Actually, I would love to be able to fill 2100 seats. I don't give a shit how the special came out, but when you do get a big laugh and like 3000 people to wait, what's the biggest crowd you've ever performed for? Um, radio city, I think, but the dentist Larry was a, I want to say 7,060 500 or so. Oh. Then we did some of the staples center. That's where it was. Staples San was even bigger. It was like 7,000 I think out here in la I did a Kevin and being have this a April fool's day thing, the April fools weekend, and it's a 7,000 that was the biggest I've ever done. It's weird because it's had some theater at universal and they're all in front of you. It's like a wall of people. It's like a real steep incline so that like the top row is like right in front of you.

Speaker 1:          00:19:14       Like everyone's right in front of, it's a very strange theater, but it's, that makes it intimate. Yeah, it's great for 7,000 people. It's as good as it gets. The, I did want to Seneca Casino, uh, this past October, I think it was like 550 seats, but same thing, theater seating. And if I have a shot, something else, I'd love to do it there. Those casinos can be fucking weird. Like you can suck or they can be great. That was a great one. But they, they hit a mess. You're right. Those Indian ones in Connecticut. Oh, fucking Christ. You don't know what you're getting. Especially the people like Connecticut. Connecticut is a fucking strange. You got people around the edges that are near Boston or the, that are not in New York that are cool, but they're like Kinda like, yeah, I didn't want to live in the city. I like, I want a yard.

Speaker 1:          00:20:00       So they'd go to Connecticut and then you've got those fucking deep Weirdos that live in those point where you have to drive five miles an hour, cause deer jumping across the road every five seconds. Yeah, yeah. You got an urban met, you've got hard for it, and then you get a, yeah, the woods and then you get the snowdy people in Greenwich and Hartford. Surprisingly shitty. I know you think of Hartford, Connecticut. It sounds regal, like Hartford, Connecticut probably was at one time. Yeah, it's Waterbury. Connecticut. Yeah. We used to be like a textile. It was unbelievable. Back in the fifties it was a beautiful city. Now you know, you know, I used to do gigs in Waterbury and get a bowl of driving through them. Yeah. It's a rough area. There's a lot of rough spots there. My wife's from outside of Waterbury. Yeah. I think the best place to stop. She's a witch doc that I mentioned that. No, no. She's from a little town from outside of Waterbury, but I mean it's, don't get me wrong. Some nice people there, but they're all dying.

Speaker 2:          00:20:56       Get Out. Cause I don't like seeing, I don't like to Mexico. See, I don't want eat VA. I don't like, I guess if you're a Gambler, I can see love and stay in there for a week, but, but I hate when I have to do it. Casino. I just don't, it it, it, to me, it draws the fucking dregs of the, he said he's people like during the late seventies you're wearing dirty running shoes at a members only jacket on a Friday night, you know, and you think you're lucky. The fuck makes you think you're lucky. You're wearing dirty running shoes and a maps only jacket and you just put two grand into the wheel of fortune machine. You fucking loser. And then they get pissed and they come to the show, right. Sit with that puts on their face. Well, especially those casinos feel like you are only here because you're a gambling junkie.

Speaker 2:          00:21:38       You're not taking a weekend in Vegas. I'm going to go to Vegas. We're going to see some shows now. We're going to go to the stratosphere. We're going to ride the rides. Ooh, no, none of that. Fucking Connecticut. And then you play in the craps table, the guy next, she is like a 20 year old kid wearing a Nick's shirt. He's a basketball shirt, like you know, fucking and work boats. What do you think you to dress up like back in the rat pack days? Not Dress up, but what the fuck? You don't have to look like crap. The collar. A little collar on your shirt. I'm not saying that, but a little alligator.

Speaker 1:          00:22:13       I have no shirts. I hate them. Do you remember when we were kids? Kids would, uh, they would so fake alligators on like generic. Well the kids in south he with like the poor kids, right? Yeah. And you get mad at you if you want to check their tag, it doesn't have it notorious. B I g has a song about that. Right. It doesn't check in your tag. Yeah. Like someone's trying to, and like, you punched him in the face like, yeah. There's like a song where he's, he punches somebody in the face where they try to check his tag because a reason for violence. Look, he's questioning your brand. You've got to do what you gotta do. If you're in certain neighborhoods, you know you've got to keep your Rep.

Speaker 2:          00:22:45       The fake ones always look just like the alligator, but it's just like a tadpole or a lizard or something. Yeah, it's a little off.

Speaker 1:          00:22:52       Yeah. Can never, you have to have nothing on your shirt or is it a weird how fucking brands become like something that everyone has to have? It's so fucking strange how sheepish people are with that kind of stuff. Sheep like, Eh, I need to wear what everybody else is wearing. Otherwise you're not in, you know, like brand. I know people that they want to have everything brand name, you know, like everything has to be brand name. And if it's not brand name like well it's just as good. It doesn't matter. You know, my wife you talking about

Speaker 2:          00:23:24       bye fucking generic. I do a bit about, we have mice in our basement, so I put traps down. She can't I, I caught a put an imported Parmigiano Reggiano, cheese and one of the fucking tracks at 18 bucks a pound. Really about Kraft singles. What the fuck she was putting imported cheese. She just wanted, you know, click cheese. Yeah. That's all we had in the fridge. And I'm like, oh, what are you fucking, you know when he Lima Biscardi don and I fucking an espresso maker. It's one of my older bits. But so what? It's true. Somebody has a good joke about piscotty. No, no. Uh, no. Pastry is good. If you have to dunk it in coffee first ESOP, nobody eats. But Scotty raw cuts the underside of your mouth. Oh, Sarah wine shake has one. She has a Scottie bit. Yeah. It's not her, it's a guy.

Speaker 2:          00:24:12       I know. It's a guy who has the bit, but yeah, I mean it's one of those things. It was like, well, I'm like, when you go to a fucking, uh, like I'm one of those coffee beans and they have, what are those hard like triangle looking? It's not a, it's a blueberry Scott Stone. Fuck's going on. I want a muffin. And all you have is scones. Bullshit. Fuck scones. Lemon bars. Not Bad. I disagree with you there. I don't mind the lemon bars. I just, I just feel like pastry should be mostly soft. I don't mind a little crusty outside and he looked like you did coke right? Updated a little ticket, dessert powder all over your face. I've never done coke but I'm always paranoid that people think I'm doing coke. Coke. You found some old old coat that I've, I haven't warned him like 10 years.

Speaker 2:          00:25:01       I'm just like going through it and I'm like what the, I just put a little baggy. Yeah, I had like four lines in it, but I'm just thinking like who, what night did I go? You know what? I'm done. I'm just going to save this for later. What the fuck man, that's not, how do you know it's coke? It might be rice. It might be like, I know how to kill this dummy. But he hated something you posted on Youtube. I just put some fucking something at a coke bag and leave it as jacket. Hilson Nord it, it's true cause I don't remember ever even buying coke or having somebody wanted to kill you. All do would have to do is buy you drinks the comedy store and then hand you a bag anthrax and you be like, fuck cancer burns. What? Joe? Now this is, you've changed since I've known you.

Speaker 2:          00:25:47       I mean you'll like this cosmic fucking you're doing, what's the Dsm? Amity DMT. Yeah. That's way different than coke. No, I know. No, I know. That's why I'm saying I would risk a heart attack. I'd rather do this shit. That shit. I would never, I'm, I'm scared. Shit of that stuff. Why scared some people don't come back, dad. That's not true. That's, it's not like LSD. It's the thing about DMT. Well first of all, your brain makes it, it's common in the body. Well then I have not a bit, I've never had it. Do you have dreams? Oh, do I ever, there you go. Can I take a drink? Kava? I have vine. Samo Kava. Yeah, yeah, yeah. That gives me dream. Yeah, that'll do it, right? Yeah, for sure. Yeah. There's a lot of Melatonin gives some people freaky dreams, sometimes just taking vitamins before you go to bed. Sometimes people get weird dreams. How bout if you kill your wife or before you go to bed, got over, make you fucking horrible drink. Just probably won't sleep. Acetylcholine

Speaker 5:          00:26:44       is a big one. Take acetylcholine before you go to sleep. You will have the fucking wild. Is that, and where do you get this shit? Yo, it's crazy. Fuck. Well it's, it's a, it's actually just a plant. It's an extract from plants. It's one of the main ingredients of Alpha brain. But who turned, who turned you on to this shit? Ah, the Internet just started doing the church. Nicotine Patch. Just put a nicotine patch before he go to bed and it keeps your nicotine. That's a good place for it. Yeah. Does it really? Yeah. It keeps your nicotine receptors alive. Well, there's a bunch of different nutrients that are shown to have a positive effect on your memory and the way your brain functions. So I started researching them about 10 years ago. I started getting into him, taking different ones, a bunch of different vitamins.

Speaker 5:          00:27:24       And it wasn't a bunch of friends that said, you gotta do this shit. What? DMT is different. I mean, this is, we're talking about like acetylcholine and nutrients and perhaps on the DMT DMT or die shit that I've found out about. Well, I heard about it first through this guy named Terrence Mckenna, who was, I've heard about Terence Mckenna through an old bill Hicks joke. Bill Hicks did it show talking about yeah, about tenants with 10 yeah, yeah, yeah. With Terence Mckenna would call a heroic dose. So I was like, who is this test? That kind of guy. And so I bought a Terence Mckenna book and I was like, Holy Shit. Is this guy going deep? I think I bought a food of the gods is crazy fuck book. This guy who was just, I mean, at the time when I'd never heard anything about like much about psychedelics, I mean, when I knew people that did mushrooms just like, let's get fucked up.

Speaker 5:          00:28:12       Hey, I've got some mushrooms. Woo, we're gonna go see some crazy shit that's not really there. Did you do that shit? Oh No, I didn't do much. I didn't party at all. Like in, I might have smoked pot five times before I was 30 maybe at the most, six or seven before I was 30 when I mean it was all, it was all when I was drunk. You know, it's like a party drunk. Someone's got a joint. Yeah, fuck it. I'll smoke some of that. And then I was like, oh, I don't want to do that again. Yeah. You know, it freaked me out. I can't feel my feet, you know, that kind of shit. That's what surprises me. Then you do this shit. Well then I started getting in a pot. I enjoy it now. I love pot. It's one of my favorite tax.

Speaker 5:          00:28:49       Yeah. Once I hit about 30 31 I started hanging out with my friend Eddie Bravo and Eddie Bravo, who is a musician, was telling me that it makes them more creative that he likes. Like I was like, makes me dopey. And he's like, you sure? Like if you ever live, you ever smoked it by itself or smoking it when you're drinking? So we smoked some and then I was like, this is the best shit ever. And we went and got ice cream Sundaes and I was like, I can't fucking believe ice cream Sundaes. Taste is good. And then you wrote a bit on, no, it's just true ice cream Sundae. I should, I probably should have. I missed the boat. But Sam, really? Oh Dude. Sex feels so much better when you're high and you kind of weed, it makes you hyper sensitive. That's why people get paranoid.

Speaker 5:          00:29:29       The reason why you get paranoid is because most of us put blinders on because you have to to get through life. I mean there's, you know, we're on a fucking planet. We're flying through space or riding around in metal boxes, you know, 60 miles an hour on the highway. Anybody at any moment in time could just fucking turn into the oncoming traffic. And you have to put blinders on to get through life. And we ignore things. And then when you smoked pot, he goes, hey, you ever think about this? You know, like, yeah, but I'm trying not to. And then people, I don't like pot because it makes me paranoid. I think it just makes you hyper sensitive.

Speaker 4:          00:29:59       Last time I smoked, it was in, when I first moved to New York City, I was in an acting class. It's cute girl and go back to her apartment like five of us from the class, smoke this shit. Then I had to go on the way home. I'm going to, I go to the bank chemical bank, I'm in line, I'm like fourth in line and they had a digital thing where your number comes up. So finally I get to the front, my number comes up and I fucking lady just stared at me and I ran out the door. That's a true story. Just freaked out. She look like, I mean school teacher and I just fucking bolted. That's the last time that was like in the early nineties that's fun. Do you want to smoke some? You know, I bet you would help me with my insomnia, wouldn't it? Sometimes, but then again, what if it's really, I hear it's like the weed today is obviously way stronger than what was going on until like 50 times one hit now a days and just see if it works. Got Some rain here and move to pause. One hit when going to help when his place. Look at this skulls and shit. That's all I need. Milkweed and look at this. This fucking go ted, you got over here. That's a boost that I shot a couple months ago. Getting the one oh one

Speaker 5:          00:31:03       no. Yeah, it was an invader from Canada. It didn't have his green card. I fucking took it out from America. No, shut that one in Canada. If you lived around here and give you some Moose takes. I've got 400 pounds of it in my few railing joke. Testosterone man. It's fucking hilarious. Cousin. I got a cousin of a hunt with a bow and arrow. He's got all kinds of, yeah, I've done some of that. I shot a bear with a bow and arrow. You do that shit high and Nah, no, no, no, no. I'm fine. Yeah, it's not bad. Caveman coffee. I don't, yeah, firearms and marijuana is not, I want to be like fucking hyper diligent, hyper aware on the point. No fucking around. You know the last thing you ever want to be involved in is a firearm accident that you could have prevented.

Speaker 5:          00:31:53       It's a good point. I didn't even think fuck that angle. I got no, I know guys who do it though. They smoke weed and then go there. Go fucking bow hunting. But getting the tree stand, smoke a joint, sit out there with nature. They like it. Thrill. At least if you're in a tree stand and you're shooting a bow and Arrow, the likelihood of you shooting yourself is very small. The likelihood of you shooting somebody else very small, you know? Yeah. Cause he in the NGO probably high back in the day when they were hunting, they didn't have much marijuana here. Not We, but they hit pay. Odious dieting. They use that. But yeah, there's probably some mushroom use going on too. But I think they would use that stuff to sort of like fucking post post, you know hunt. They're kind of like celebrate, celebrate or something like that.

Speaker 5:          00:32:35       But the vikings, you know, used to use mushrooms and go on Soda Zercher no, not those guys. They steroids different vikings. Who's that fucking giant dude who there's all these photos of this, some, some football player. There was like a bunch of memes with this guy, Steve. You know what I'm talking about? It was his steroid precursor. No, I mean probably who the fuck knows? You know? I don't know. Is it a college kid? Is it college hit? Yeah, he's in college. He's like, oh, he's saying six eight to 90 or something like that. I mean the people today are so God damn freaky. Huge.

Speaker 1:          00:33:09       Yeah. We're present body fat. It's just run like deer.

Speaker 5:          00:33:11       Yeah. This is the guy. What? Look at this. This is not the right picture, but look, there's one picture of this guy standing around a bunch of other people and he just like, Yo, what the fuck? How was that guy? So yeah, that's the photo. That photo

Speaker 1:          00:33:24       right? Yeah. Yeah. The size of that mother fucker. That guy was created in a lab that doesn't even look like a real person and the non negative body fat.

Speaker 5:          00:33:33       What do you got going on? Making the pitch picture bigger. Oh the, yeah, that's not the f B. There's a full photo of them. There it is. Yeah. See if you can make that better. This Twitter, Twitter doesn't. When you do, when you try to enlarge a Twitter photo, it doesn't let you do that. For some reason. You go to a certain size and then it blanks out on, yeah. Yeah. He looks like a, like a lab experiment. You know when you go back and you look like Jim Brown back when he was playing Sean Oakman, that's the the gentleman's name. I will call him a gentleman from now on. By the way, he's something, some insane size and he's still in college. It just doesn't make any sense. People are just way bigger now. I don't know if it's hormones in the meat. No. 12 year old girls with mustad handled my various, look at this, look at this mother fucker cheese. Just

Speaker 1:          00:34:18       I fucking Christ. Probably a strong safety toe. Look at the size of that guide. It doesn't even look like a human look how he's towering over the guys next to him. Look at his arms. He said, yeah, they're popping out of his shell. Well, why is he have pants on? They're not going to help pass a useless. What the fuck? He doesn't have pads on. Do what the fuck? What the fuck and naughty. She got a stomach like a cheerleader. Just, yeah, those why. I was thinking that the other day, like how come do it never caught on with guys to wear like a midriff exposed shirts. It's like girls wear those exclusively like midriff in West Hollywood lately. Yeah, with the tide and the not in front. That's the best. Like Ellie Mae fucking clamping boulevard. Oh, the fucking Beverly hillbillies. Yeah. Nobody, nobody fucked. Back then you watched the Beverly hillbillies. Nobody ever, ever fucked Ellie Mae. Who? Did she even go on a date on that Shell? Yeah, with Jethro brother. Then you had the first lesbian in Hollywood. I think it was mishandled away. I thought it was Alice. I think a heavily hillbillies. Alice from the Brady was Alison, but I think, oh Christ. Yeah. Christ. Yeah. She played Texas. She was a nose tackle before she goes. She landed the role of Ellis.

Speaker 1:          00:35:43       See the copy. I'm stumbling over my own friends and we're getting angry already. Fucking Shit fucking on people. She was good, but no, but ms Hathaway was, but I think the Beverly hillbillies predated the lady that worked at the bank. Yes. There were always kissing his ass because, yeah, because Jed had all the money. Yeah. The one that Dennis Miller said when he's talking about Bruce John, hey, when did Bruce Jana Turner to missions Hathaway from the best? It's not the best reference, but I see what he's going. Oh, exactly. It wasn't, that smell is a strange cat man. He is a strange guy. Don't like them. I like him too. I mean, I, I like him as a person. I've talked to them, I enjoy talking to him. But he, nine 11 came along and that guy just went flunking. He took our right turn and hit that gas.

Speaker 1:          00:36:32       I was already there. You were always there. Fuck yeah. Stuck out like a sore thumb and Boston didn't I go, well, Boston's a little right wing. I mean, there's a lot of left wing in Boston, but there's a lot of right wing too. You're right. It's so left that we used to talk about this at Nick's. It's so left wing that it came full circle. They started to have shit and common like people from Southie and, and you know, it was, remember Barry Crimmins you remember though, you know, um, I was talking to bobcat this weekend. Bobcat Goldthwait came to the UFC and I got him and his daughter's boyfriend is a big UFC fan. I got him some tickets and hung out with them and he just did a documentary on Barry Crimmins and that's right. I heard them talking about it. It's pretty intense piece sick now.

Speaker 1:          00:37:18       Barry Wright is he, he, he was a couple of years ago, they had a benefit for him. Oh, I didn't, I didn't know about that. Yeah, but this was about, uh, Barry was apparently you molested as a child, as a young child. And this, this is sort of like explaining how we became this, like sort of angry, curmudgeon, right. Type into prep, patently of fucking really deep and intense documentary. And, uh, it's coming out, it's gonna be on Sundance and there they're going to come on the show in, um, sometime either late January or February, but, um, it's a, it's a fucked up, fucked up bobcat title to like call me lucky or something like that. Like I'll be like, I like, that's what he, you know, he named the, uh, the documentary, something along those lines. He told me the title. It was howling laughing, but yeah, Barry Crimmins was like super left.

Speaker 1:          00:38:09       I remember hearing that him saying that he came out one night and he would have broke down on stage. It stitches about that. Whoa. That's what I remember hearing. I don't think, I can't remember if I had already moved to New York at that point, but I remember somebody telling me second hand that he like that he let it all out on stage one night or something. But you know, left wing back then was a different thing. Oh yeah. Hell yeah. It was way more tolerant. Yeah, it was way, way more tolerant or, and now it's become a lot of like shaming and call outs. It's become this aggressive tactic thing like the, the uh, aggressively left wing in your face about it, which is, it creates conflict more than it resolves anything. Absolutely. You know, I mean, Barry was like, he was like a pro union guy because he believed that people should get good wages. He bought American beer. He would always drink a Budweiser stage. I was a bar back. I used to carry that. I carry a case of bud. I was a bar back for like six months in stitches. I'll refer. I started comedy with Suzy. Suzy. Remember Susie, the manager of a stitches, she was in that band. They had a, a parody band where they walk like an Egyptian without walk with an erection.

Speaker 1:          00:39:21       Harry can 40 was running it at the town and but barrier. Right. I used to bring a case of Budweiser and you're right now we think back on it. He was hiding something. He would drink that case throughout the night. That'd be maybe two left. I mean, wow. In about them. You know, I sit around after and he had a cooler and he's the only guy that ever tip me as a bar back. He was a kid, big walrus mustache. He was kind of intimidating. And what's funny is I know it's like really critical. He so I mean radical left wing, but he used to make me laugh as hard as any bunch and me tingle and tingle. I mean the funny guy, no doubt about it. I always quote tingles joke about Ronald Reagan. This was when I was an open miker. I saw him perform this cause when I was an open mic or was right after the whole Reagan Contra thing and went down, I was like 1988 and right after Reagan was out of office, they were, they were, uh, he was on trial and they were asking him, did you sell arms to Iran?

Speaker 1:          00:40:14       He said, I don't remember. I don't recall. Mr President, who you sent when you sell arms to people who hate us, shut it down. That is a perfect Boston Jimmy tingle is this such a great line shot down? That is a good tangle jog. Yeah, he was good. He and he's another one. He's like real left wing but reasonable in his left wing. Absolutely. You know, it's like left wing now has become this like super hyper fascist funks there's like I've experienced, I experienced it at a pretty hardcore way when I came out again and I'm pretty fucking left wing and a lot of issues on gay rights, on gay marriage, on a, a lot of different issues on racial issues, but I also own guns. I'm in the NRA. I'm a lot a lot of like, I feel like there's a lot of credible issues on both sides. But there was this guy who got a sex change and then started fighting women in MMA. I was like, get the fuck out of here. And all these people were calling me transphobic and big ed and all this crazy shit and that's when I got really, that's when I really experienced the full understanding of what it means to be a social justice warrior. Right. Anytime a man is critical of women, anytime a man Shit's a woman, that guy

Speaker 5:          00:41:34       cause 10 bucks. That's it. She has one arm, we don't shit on them. Shit on the ones for a thousand. You don't even feel bad about it. It's like we got, you got paid well, but anytime a man is doing something horrible against a woman or saying something like that, that guy becomes a misogynist less, you're criticizing a transgender person. See transgender is more marginalized than women. So a transgender guy who becomes a girl now can fight women. And if you criticize that, you're criticizing a former guy who's now a girl and that's like, yeah, it gets both cause that, right. So he's fighting guys now at least he's out what she is out of the closet or you know, not, I shouldn't say out of the closet. I said uh, out and open about it because the first two women she fought didn't know that she used to be a guy.

Speaker 5:          00:42:32       I saw some of this on. It was fucking crazy. What's crazy? His name is no need. No need to get this captain anymore fucking publicity than she's already gotten this. Just cause it. She had a hundred youtube videos complaining about me. But the bottom line dailies, yeah, there's, there's two, there's two schools about it. There's transgender reassignment doctors who say, no, she's totally a woman's toe. But then there's martial artists and then a regular endocrinologist. They go, Whoa, Whoa, hold on a second. Like, yeah, talking about just regular sports. And I'm talking about someone who's competing and say, you know, fucking madness, like racing Renee Richards, there was another one who was on a mountain bike weight racer, forgot riding a mountain bike racer who dominated all the women in her first professional event is beating him like fucking 10, 15 seconds faster than everybody. And it was like, what the fuck? And these are like a lot of people like encouraged her to get into, you know, competing as a woman. And then, you know, just the inherent differences of the fucking male and female frame really get highlighted when you watch somebody beat the shit out of somebody who is a natural born woman versus someone who's becoming a woman. He tells you certain things you can't change.

Speaker 2:          00:43:42       Jodie, you remember, you remember Super Foot Wallace? Fuck yeah, I do. Do you remember when the woman went up against him on why were all the sports? No. Ah, why did she go wonder if it's Stella around while it wasn't even, can't be cause a kickboxing. Yes, Bill. Super Fun. I don't know what Billie Jean King and the whole movement was in full swing and this broad comes running out and he fucking drops her like a used rubber fucking the first who's I came as a round house or just a paunch probably a hook kick or a punch because he had the, he had the best hook kick and say, I want to say it was a kick to the head. Then they drag her back to a court and they sit her up again and they send her out again and he does it again. No Way. Yes. Really map as a kid going, what the fuck? Sharing. Oh,

Speaker 5:          00:44:26       there's a woman named Lucio Riker. It was probably one of the best women boxers of all time and she fought a guy and it was like one of the first, uh, men versus female. She has fought a mediocre guy and she's like a world champion that everybody like Christy Martin was docket are all these women were docker. She wasn't going to kill that man. We're the coal miner's daughter. This does this, this Lucy Lucier Riker chick was arguably one of the best female boxers of all time. Got fucking lit up like a Christmas tree by this dude and knocked dead just womp. He caught her with a punch and just fucking turned the lights out in Georgia and she face planted. It was ugly because you know, you're, you're watching a guy beat the shit out of a chair. It's just, it doesn't matter if they're the same weight class, it doesn't matter if they, they have the same amount of body mass.

Speaker 5:          00:45:09       It's a different structure. Well, I, Chris Rock said, yeah, you know, we were talking about that. He goes, yeah, you still have a hundred and he still had 105 pound chin though. That's the deference or whatever. Well, they can definitely, men can definitely take punches better for the most part when it's guys that are built much more slender and feminine, but this one woman who used to be a man is not, is not built feminine. You know, you get man shoulders and fucking man hands, man, hands hit harder, man. Shoulders are wider. The whole deal. It's just, but the point being until then I had not experienced the full impact of the progressive movement, the full aggressive response. Totally a logically. I'm like, look, we're just, we're not talking about her right to be a woman. I fully support that. You want to, I wouldn't know what it was like to be born a man as a problem.

Speaker 5:          00:45:56       I fully support you changing your, your sex. No problem at all. Change your gender. No problem at all. I have no problem with, I'll call you whatever the fuck you want, but if you beat the shit out of my sister, I'm probably going to come out to you. This is going to be honest with you. I try to be tolerant until I find out that you did not disclose the fact that used to be a man and my sister's in the fucking hospital cause you're shinned her in the head. You know? It's like this is a different world. You're talking about. You're talking about the world of combat sports. That's my world and I'm telling you right now, there's a big goddamn difference between the way a man hits a bag and the way a woman hits the bag. He watched the difference between the impact.

Speaker 5:          00:46:29       I'm not, I don't know how much gets taken away by that sex change, but not enough. Not Enough. That's right. Just this, just, just too much. That's good. More out the dead, which you can't. You know what? You can't change, dude, that you can't change the size of the fists. You can't change the, the the you mean? Yeah, the frame, the frame. If you, that woman dies and a thousand years now scientists dig up her body, they're going to go, oh, there's a dude that's a dude skeleton. There is going to know that it was transgender. It's a woman. They're not going to know that. They're going to say, this is a male skeleton, looks at the hips. That's, those are male hips. They, that was a boundary that even feminists used to stay away from, but now they seem to be pushing that. Like I, I was, I was a Gotham a couple of years. I've got to fight breaks. I had nothing to do with me on stage. Like two tables get into it. And there was women right in the middle of it swinging over what? I Dunno, they, someone was being loud and another table complaint and those boyfriends and girlfriends at the table. Then they just started fucking swinging on it. And there was a girl right in

Speaker 2:          00:47:30       the middle. She's trying to hit the doorman and the other doorman came over. Whoa. Fucking knocked out the doorman. She know he popped her. Yeah, that's what I'm saying. Yeah. Or he at the Dorman yesterday. You don't fuck around at Gotham. Those were all former cops. It's exactly Pfizer, a big fucking Irish squared jaw sandwiches that have knocked a lot of fucking head's loose. Yeah. And these chicks right in the middle fucking throat trying to throw haymakers because they bought into this shit. Yeah. You know what I mean? They're going a little too far with it. Did you see the woman trying to play football? No. On the Internet? No. Look it up, but it was an indoor league or an arena league or whatever. It's like first and goal from the five yard line. She's a female. Run them. And I don't mean like a big, because I'm a woman.

Speaker 2:          00:48:14       She just thinks she's fast. She tries to, yeah, they tried to run her off tackle like four times and she, each time she gets hit more bro. Even how it was like cringing, I don't even know. I don't even know her name. It was like an indoor league or arena league, but it said, you know, she was like the first one, first female to play in a pro game. That wasn't a kicker. Physical equality is nonexistent. It's just nonexistent. And it's definitely, it's not even existent inside the genders. Male you like, there's certain fucking men. Oh, it just guys who fight in the UFC. Oh, you're just like this guy, Hector Lombard. There's fucking freak of nature of this Cuban Olympian judo player who's just fucking knockout artists. You watch him fight and you're like, Whoa, homos is unfair that he fights regular people even though they're bald.

Speaker 2:          00:49:01       They're all 170 pounds. That's a fucking different hundred and 70 pounds. But at least there, I mean it's, there's no fair when it comes to that shit and that's part of what, what it is to be a champion. Like what is this five foot, 230 pound female running back plays a professional football game. Watch the, oh no, she's still alive. All right. Two guys that knocked her out. Why would she do that? She was taking shots like I've let say, please pray the play. That's it. And they give the bottle like three times in a row. Are we going to get pulled from youtube? Let's see.

Speaker 2:          00:49:38       Let's, we'll edit this ladies and gentlemen. And if we get pulled from Youtube Jamille just edit that peanut. I think Google it. What's the name of it? Uh, the, the, it's called five foot two. It's on Daily Mail. Five foot two 130 pound female running back plays in professional football game. But I think the video is actually pulled from this website. So really by her husband. Yeah, cause this is not playing the fucking United Nations as a crime against humanity. Right.

She, she didn't go off the pill. That's hurt. You see your flaws. You see it go flying through the air through her. Don't, let's not watch this. I don't want to watch that. Yeah.

Oh, she's probably played, I guess before you got to, you got to juice

Speaker 5:          00:51:23       even she's juicing, you know, God. I mean, you'd have to juice for so long that you actually became a man. We had a, um, a guy in the podcast that used to be a woman and became a man, a buck angel. She's Kinda Belamine. Well, when she was a woman, she was built like slender and now he's a man and he's pretty thick. And He, at one point in time we got to like one 85. He was fucking Yolk. But you said it was like too much pressure on the joints, like because he just fucking bang and testosterone doing dead lifts, but this, you know, there's only so much that changes. It doesn't change the size of your fucking face and the size of your hands and all that stuff gets smashed. You know? How does, let me ask you a question. How does Stallone, he's 68 he's still Joseph, right? Yeah. I watch these movies and he's ripped. He's more than 68 now. I think he's almost 70 I'm, I'm, I'm ready to juice. Yeah, you should do it. Yeah. It's testosterone replacement therapy. Where Ellie? Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:52:20       Do it. Give me a name of the doc. Damn, I'm good. Sherry. Physique of fucking buddy Epson. Yeah. Listen, it makes it the Beverly Hills Rep. The bottom line still alone in 68 yeah. He's my canary in a coal mine. As long as I fucking guy's alive. We're all good. I'm telling you that. Look it, there's a lot of science involved in it. And if you go to the right doctor, right, you make sure that you get your level, your blood levels checked on a regular basis. It's not any more dangerous than aging. Aging's fucking terrible. A great point agent gets you. No matter what you do, everybody dies from aging and the people are like, oh, that's eventually going to kill you. Oh, like unlike life. Well, I'm going to get cheated out of a month. Listen, you know it's, he's got a good, a new Rambo.

Speaker 1:          00:53:01       He's doing a new fucking rhino. No, just calling it laugh. Last blood. Somebody said is that somebody made a menopause joke about it. I forget who it was. Somebody said that already has never been the fucking [inaudible] 68 year old guy that looks like him. No, I mean, my wife says I'm in love with them and that kind of now I like Stellato. He still sucks me in and don't like those. Look at that. The fuck out of here. We have that picture of him. Will you that picture of, that's recent. Look at that. That's recent. How is that possible man? Testosterone. What? That's what's missing from old people. So my GNC pills, that's a test us Ronnie, not cutting it does a bunt. Those, those help a little do that, you know, you know it helps a lot is I'm dead lifts and squats on that hill sprints and anytime you do something that's like compound exercises that require your body to like put out a lot of energy, like big bursts, evangelists, those force your endocrine system to fire up because your body's like this motherfucker is going to be lifting weights like he's going to, he's going to do this all the time.

Speaker 1:          00:54:09       We got to produce a lot more hormones than we regularly are. But if you just sit around in a fucking office and you don't exercise, your testosterone levels are just, your body only does what it has to do this right? That's why people get muscle atrophy when they don't work out. Your muscles shrink because your body's like, we don't need things that happens to young people. And if you don't work out, your body is like, we don't need this. Well that's the same thing when you get old. If you get old and you're not lifting weights, your bone density decreases. A lot of shit happens. My, my giant stuff, I did p 90 x, right? I did, you know, he's supposed to do it for 90 days. I did it for like 11 months. I got obsessed with, whoa. And I dropped like 10 pounds, which is all I wanted to drop.

Speaker 1:          00:54:46       I was in like this, I, I did this like, uh, it ended about a year and a half ago, but I kept doing it. You only supposed to do and there's a reason you're only supposed to do it because it's kind of tough on your joints. So I did it for like 11 my Austin. I get up my, my knees a clicking and it's not because it's not because the p nights, because I abused it. Right. You know, I mean, there's a lot of jump acts is a lot of stuff that people say. It's kind of out of fashion now. Uh, well, not out of fat, but you know, I mean, um, I just not for a guy in his fifties and I may, yeah. Well, there's some people that have some good ideas about like, and limitations are a lot of times based on injuries, like, oh, this guy got it, he hurt his back.

Speaker 1:          00:55:23       Well, don't do that anymore and you won't hurt your back. There's a lot of ideas that people have, but it's, it's all about knowing your body, knowing how much stress you put on your body and giving your body plenty of recovery time and then giving your body the right nutrients to recover. Like fish oil, vitamin D, protein, a full range of multivitamins. This is super important for your body and food, like eating the right foods. That's, that's very important. Like all the vitamins in the world, they're not going to help you if you're eating fucking cheeseburgers every day. Who else did you eat healthy? Oh yeah. Yeah, a lot of salmon, chicken. Let a protein, vegetables, that's me. You know, just enough carbs to fuel me. And it worked. Yeah, it worked. Fucking awesome. Oh, you did everything because you get your heart rate goes through the roof and, and uh, no, there's no digest. Abused it. I, I got it. I had never done anything that worked like that since I was in my twenties and I played football in college. I was the best shape I was in and I was like, Holy Shit. And that's what we were doing back then. We were doing, you know, a lot of plyometrics and right. And that's

Speaker 4:          00:56:24       what we did in college to get, and I was in great condition, but I couldn't, I was doing it six times a week and he's supposed to stop at the 90 days. I didn't know you're supposed to stand up. I just thought it was 90 days. You're in your 50s you are, you know, I mean if you're 25 you can fucking do it for three years. I'm sure the guy that does it is like 50 oh, he's older than that now Tony. Yeah, Tony Go. Great shape. I know.

Speaker 5:          00:56:46       Do you know, isn't it? There's another one that you can do that's called the extreme, a kettlebell cardio workout by this guy, Keith Weber does not. No jumping and no, none of that stuff. It's all just want, I do it with a 30 little bell. He saw that out there. I tried to pick it up and I got, well, I'm done with that shit. That's 70 pounds, so that's a heavy one. Just this one was a light one. It's just a full cardio workout. It's fucking, you pick up a 35 pound Kettlebell, it feels like nothing, but after like a man, Holy Shit. You're like, how much time is this going? It's a 45 minute workout. Oh my God, 20 minutes in your fucking legs are on fire. Your lungs are on fire, but it's very low stress and your joint because there's not a lot of weight and it's not like no, no jumping or anything like that. I fucking love that workout and do it all the time. It's fantastic, but it's like one of those ones. He's doing it so you do it, you follow along. Those are the best ones. That's what's good about that. P Nine zero x. It's like exactly. Do what they're doing and then you know it's over. When you're done, you show up. Yeah, that's, I'm his fucking just actually doing shit like so many people like, ah, I want to get in shape

Speaker 4:          00:57:48       the fucking guy that's all just fucking do it. Nobody does it. It just fucking talk about it, talk about it. He said that and one a, and one of the things he goes, just show up and hit play and it, that actually set off the thing in my hand, no matter how Shitty I felt, I'd gone on and go,

Speaker 5:          00:58:03       yeah. You know, I always give myself advice like, uh, like something like a lot of times when I land somewhere I'm like, oh, I don't want to go to the gym, you know? And I'm like, oh, come on pussy man up. And then I tell myself like, all right, I pretend like I'm talking to me and I call myself a pussy and then I just go. But I always feel better when I do, you know, it's like knowing when you feel like shit because you're getting sick and knowing when you feel like shit, just because this mother fucker gets up. I'll tell you what that mother fucker gets up.

Speaker 4:          00:58:33       He put that picture up. Brian, I read an article. He said he, when he was, you know, when he was doing the, the, the, uh, the, uh, expendables, no, the first blood Rambo, he was so obsessed with working out. He'd go, he'd be out in south beach, shit paste, and then go right to the jump drunk at three in the morning. Really? Yeah. When he was drunk, he didn't stay alone with workouts. Yes. He said he was obsessed with it. I didn't even know he got drunk. That's what he said. Well, he said he was at bars. I'm guessing that's what he was doing and he'd go right to the frigging gym. That's hilarious. Three in the morning.

Speaker 5:          00:59:03       Well that's if you fall the rock, fall, the rocks Instagram page. If you ever want to feel like a lazy fuck, follow the rocks Instagram page. He'll like fucking fly somewhere at five o'clock in the morning and he's like, touchdown 5:00 AM gym five 30. And he's like the gym doing fucking,

Speaker 4:          00:59:21       sorry, has the kettlebells,

Speaker 5:          00:59:22       kettlebells. Yeah. Yeah, he's on it. I'll fly to a hotel in the gym. I could see it from my room. I won't go to it now. Just stare at it. It's old. It's a fucking, it's gonna get me hurt. So Nautilus, they're updated. They're bad for your joints. Pull that picture up. Look at this motherfucker. 70 years old of hilarious. Yeah. Look how he's looking out the window. You move to shoot somebody who killed somebody as well. It's going to frigging nine pack. He's an actor. Look at, he's awesome. That's true. If I knew somebody, you know, if I knew 12 main people going to see me, how to actually put in the time. Yeah. I mean, but when it's my wife who gives a fuck? Yeah. Listen Bitch, you gonna suck it. And whether you like it or not, we're getting divorced. You decide you want to be lonely.

Speaker 5:          01:00:07       Ah, rude. That's a great idea. I never thought about that. You use divorced, like suck it or divorce. You're not a good idea. That's why you're not married. Yeah. I say, yeah. I say something ridiculous and he's like, what a great idea. I'm joking around. He's like, hey, this is doctor. Let me write this down. When did you get married five years ago. Was it fun? I know you get kids, but I don't know yet. For some reason I didn't think you were married. I held off for a while. I think marriage is ridiculous, but I'm not going to wear, I have kids. I love having kids. I even enjoy being married, but I don't. I think the idea of a legal contract with the state and illegal more, more ridiculous is the idea that you bring a bunch of people that you don't even know and if you decide to break up, they decide where all the money goes and you have to split things up.

Speaker 5:          01:00:58       And I've had some friends that have gone through some absolutely fucking brutal divorces. Will you understand what divorce really is? It's a business. I mean the, the, the marriage system in this country and the encouragement is involved in getting marriage. Getting married is about selling diamonds. That's a big one. And then distribution of assets, which a big part of go to the legal system. That's when people don't think about Phil Hartman was the first one to fucking the tro turned me onto that. But how about the flip side, you know, illegitimate kids and all that and know, well, the solution to the family and how that turns out, well, what's legitimate and what's not. I mean, if you're together and you're the father and she's the mother, you fucking jump over a broom. Like they didn't roots and you say, we're married. You know, I have friends that have kids that they, they changed their names and they're not married.

Speaker 5:          01:01:44       You know, they decide we don't need to do this legally. You know, I have friends that got married like on a Lark, like they're not really married. They got married by a friend, you know, like dude. And they went through a whole ceremony, dug Stan hope, did that. He got married and was like a fake. And then like when she went crazy, he was like, well, I guess, uh, let's not be married anymore. They just don't have to go to court. I didn't understand. Help. Got Married. You got married. While that wasn't real, it wasn't real. It's just like they did everything except signing the actual papers. They wear the rings or whatever. If he went to court, if she took them to court, I bet she could file. Yeah, I bet. Back then they were together. She get all his suits. Yeah. She would get all those fucking goofy suits he wears.

Speaker 5:          01:02:23       Isn't there like a law, if you live with somebody for over seven years, that's a domestic partner or that could be kind of law, common law. Marriage. That's right. Is that an all state? I don't think so. I think it varies state by state, but California, it's definitely, uh, it exists in California and there's also a thing about being married more than a certain amount of time. I have a friend who was married for 12 years in, uh, you know, fucking towards the end. It was brutal. We couldn't deal with anymore. No kids broke up with her, has to pay alimony for the rest of her life forever. She apparently, because he paid for her for 12 years. I mean, she's like 49, 50. She might live, he's paying him. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. He's paying forever. Forever. He's paying a forever.

Speaker 5:          01:03:10       They were married when she was 30 no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. This is California divorce law. Talking about America. When you go, it's the People's Republic of California. When you'd go through a certain amount of years of marriage in California, you are obligated. If you are the guy who's, was it the caretaker? I don't know how to describe it. If you're the guy who's got the money with it, with a friend, be Kurt Russell. No, it's different guy. What was he doing? He, Curtis was never married and never got married again because of that. Goldie Hawn. Well, they both have money though. My friend was married. His wife was just fucking getting her nails done, bringing her little fucking showed a tiny dog, get it washed. He has to pay her for the rest of her life. He's married now to another woman and he pays her exorbitant amounts of money every month, and she lives in his old house in the fucking Palisades.

Speaker 5:          01:03:57       It's sweet house, and she moved her boyfriend in. And when you're living with a man, then it's supposed to be, you know, he, he's not supposed to pay anymore. So he brings an investigator into the situation. The investigator goes and they check the house. The guy moves out when the investigator comes, he's around the corner with a fucking u haul. As soon as they leave, comes back around my shit back. They go through this little dance where they do, if she gets married again, he doesn't have to pay her anymore. But then she'd lose out on hundreds of thousands of dollars a year. I mean, I think he pays or something like six or 700 grand a year. Well that's why, and I'm not saying this is justified, but that's why a lot of guys snap. Oh yeah. I mean, same with all the, uh, you know, child custody thing.

Speaker 5:          01:04:38       Like you know, it all, it's all favor towards the mom and that case and guys fucking snap. Well, in some cases it's justified, but they do, uh, the, the, the systems are fucked up because first of all, these people don't know you. So if you go into court and you know, it's everyone's trying to present their argument like they're the perfect person. I am the perfect husband. I was the perfect dad. I, you know, my wife is a crazy bitch. You know, I was the perfect mom, my husband, they weren't there. Yeah. I've also had friends that their um, their wives when they're breaking up, we'll file a restraining order and say that he was threatening and being abusive. And if it's just you and her alone that she, they can say all kinds of crazy shit and that's

Speaker 2:          01:05:18       a guy would snap. Well, I mean, if you're going to ruin my life, I have a friend who was a woman who was getting divorced and her lawyer advised her to do that and she was like, what? Like she couldn't fucking blue. She's like, no, he's not violent, I'm not going to do that. But she was like, look at a little favor you in court, you know, say that, you know, say that he was abusive. Say that he threatened you and you can, you know, and he likes phrase it in a way where he wasn't suggesting it. He was saying one of the best ways to ensure you know favor with the court is if your husband was abusive. Has he been abusive as he ever said anything violent to you? You know [inaudible] like and she's like, are you insinuating? He's like, well I'm just saying that if you did that and she's like, stop and I'm not going to do, have you, have you seen that movie gone girl? Yes. Holy Shit. That was kind of a good example of that whole little bit good. Maybe. Fuck Yeah Dude, you haven't seen it now cause it seems like a chick flick. It seems like it. It's, it's weird. It's it. I can't get past the hall.

Speaker 2:          01:06:19       It's the opposite of a chick flight. Well it is. It's to me. I Dunno. I have my own take. I can't watch too much shit out of holiday without seeing that the fucking angry feminists head raring. It's fucking face and everything. Yes. It was just an x. Do you see a much hate if you listen to the, there was an unbelievably well written, but yeah, but that's a hateful woman who wrote that Shit. She hates men with a fucking patch, but then they can justify it at the end by going, well, the woman's the crazy bitch in the movie. That's what they do. Or alert. Listen, don't say any more because people, if you haven't seen that movie, it's good fucking mood. What happens in the end? No, I've watched it in a hope to get out and it ready. I watched it in a hotel room in Vegas.

Speaker 2:          01:06:56       I was just like fucking by myself and I was like, Eh, I don't want to go to bed and see what's on TV. He was like, one o'clock in the morning, I'm gonna Watch this till I fell asleep. 10 minutes in them fucking white knuckle and the pill. What the fuck? Yeah. But it was so slick on and I was, the dialogue is so slick and I'm like, people really talk like that, but, but the venom and the hatred towards men, that's what I was getting out of it. I, this woman had you listening, you have to sleep in a hotel room. I had two pots of coffee. Me, I was sitting a foot from the TV yelling at it. Go on. This broad is vicious. Well but it was really, really mean and well written and she's got books out. Her last name is Flynn.

Speaker 2:          01:07:36       Apparently the book is really good. Apparently the bullet is more complex. It's more of like a murder mystery. Whereas in the movie, you know they're condensing it down to two hours or whatever the hell it was. But he didn't see like it the way she was categorizing guys. You know, his idea of a fantasy would be a fucking no reality show marathon and with his hand down his pants, you haven't said Shit like that. I bought a woman and a fucking bold please it drill yet of Hollywood and all. But I just felt like they were telling a story and you know, given the scenario without telling what the movie's about, it totally made sense. I mean, you know, it makes sense, but it's also coming from, you know, it's a woman writing that shit down. It's coming out of her filthy hope and a, and if a guy ever did the equivalent, you couldn't get the movie made, it wouldn't get green lit.

Speaker 2:          01:08:25       I'm just saying, I want to quality. If you're going to be a fucking Douche bag, I want the right to be a Douche bag back. Well, it used to be, they used to be a horse. Mack woman and movies, Cary grant movies and shit happened in real life. Mac. Well, how about, you know, who were the, uh, uh, who sticks the grapefruit, his wife's face? Archie bunker who sticks a grapefruit as well as whole movie. Yes. I'm huck. You can't believe I'm going. I'm going. I'm talking about the caffeine. Yeah. Don't hurt your eyes. Um, Cagney James Cagney. Oh really? Yeah. He goes, I wish you were a wishing well and you'd fucking sink or somebody sticks a grapefruit. His wife's face at the kitchen table. It's beautiful. I played on a loop, but it would be, I mean, I wish you, you know, it's, it's going too far the other way now.

Speaker 2:          01:09:12       It's all you could smack women in the face and they would kiss you afterwards. That was, those days were different. What was it? Who's going on back then where you could just smack women was zero line like dumb and beating Bartow county. Is that what was going on? Yeah, the blood into this feminist horse shit. They're going to to follow themselves. Yeah, but I mean, why was the guy hitting her in the first place? How about just have a conversation? Burnt his eggs? I mean, come on, let's be, no, I don't know. Of course Guy Nicholas, how dare you. Oh my God. This is horrendous. You're going to come after you and Nick Dipaolo the feminists. They're not going to come to your shows anymore. No, exactly as I would hope. They started picketing. Great. He'll go down. Wish she'd stop again. Watching.

Speaker 2:          01:09:57       Hi. We're here with emotion. Well, can I tie a buck at the end? Thank you. Whoa. Maybe found someone you like better. Oh Shit. Oh my God. That's all she said is maybe you found someone you liked better. That was fucking palms are in the face of it. That was hard for the actual realize. I didn't realize it was that hard either. You know where I saw that on the soprano's Tony Soprano's watching that movie at home. I think it's public enemy or something and uh, that's where I first saw that and I go, Holy Shit. How'd they get away with it? Jesus Christ. Look at his face kind of. Well, it's like, you know who I go, Ooh. Slapped. You know who wouldn't it godfather across the face. Yeah. That was like a palm strike. Yeah. That was crazy. Yeah. That was not just like a most of the face. He had some like some snap to it. It was the heel of the hand. Yeah, that hurts. I'm going to show a different take. That really did look rough for them. The one I remember, I kick that bad. That was horrible. I'm with you on that one. He was a real quick, all she said was maybe a final time. I'm better. I'm only have files on your right.

Speaker 1:          01:11:14       Yeah. She's being fairly reasonable. Yeah. She wasn't even screaming. See, but that's just it. 10 years ago. You probably saw that and was like, yeah, that she deserved it, but we're all getting the side in the last 10 DXC years ago, Brian Movies from 50 fucking years. That's a long time ago. More than 50 years ago. That movies from like the 50s right? Wasn't that maybe even maybe even 40 yeah. Well, James Cagney public enemy, I don't even know if that's public and girls always had that, that old school hair, that old school. That way we like that Fay ray had, when king cotton picked her up, right. That was before flat irons and they also had like fluffy shit around the end of their sleeves. Like that was super common. Keys fisting a poodle. Give your wife showed up at the dinner table and she was wearing a shirt like that. You'd be like, what the fuck are you wearing? That? Sure, sure. How about his pajamas? It's what John are. Excellent cap guy. Mike Brady snapping. It's like what? You were in jail when you breaking rocks with a hammer.

Speaker 1:          01:12:15       1931 public enemy. 1931 yeah. Oh my God. I think that was it. I think that's public enemy. Yeah. Social media back then was a newspaper. I mean there was no one, you know, social media between people. Shit. There was nothing. Nobody had a voice back then, you know, and a nice, it was quiet. But it's interesting because you could kind of could shape society with movies like a movie like that where you see James Cagney hit a chicken, the face with a grapefruit. That would be imitated by people who went to see that movie. Yeah. You don't think that happens now godfather? Oh yeah, it definitely does. But at least now you have like people that counter that like this is horse shit. This, this gone girl was fucking feminist tropes. Bullshit. You know? Or this, this gone grows. It shows you the know the misogynistic patriarchal society that we looked at because arguments, people can have their own sites and debate it.

Speaker 1:          01:13:07       Back then, you know, you watched it, chick got hit with a grapefruit and then you went home and you hit, your wife had a great fruit. Now you hit her with a Panini. I mean, how many people have watched movies and thought that's how to behave? I saw this in a movie, so this is what you do. I mean, it's gotta be pretty fucking comment. Well, just look at all the Scarface tee shirt, Scarface. How many he has a role model. Huh? Is there ever been a fucking movie where a guy was like more of an anti hero that became like a Jew? Never write a drug dealer murderer was coked out of his fucking mind became like an iconic cultural figure. No. I know it says something about where we're headed, but everybody loved that movie. I fucking loved that movie and I didn't love him.

Speaker 1:          01:13:50       I wouldn't wear them fucking get my kid a tee shirt with his face on it. But yeah, that's crazy. You see little five year old kid with a scarf or a shirt. You're like, what? Kids? Like, where's the fucking face patient? Their money. Then you'll get the power. Then you'll get the push to that bad guy leaving the restaurant like shit, I know Joe was doing a breath. I'm putting mine away. That was embarrassed. I was a good fucking movie. It was a good fucking movie. How about me? When I go to see that, I go to see at the date came out and uh, so it was really crowded at the theater and this is my hometown and Danvers. I sneaked down by the, by the ropes, waiting for the doors to open so I can run in and sit in the front of the next showing the door is open.

Speaker 1:          01:14:32       What do I see him falling in the pool? Oh, I just went into denial. I'm like, that's not him. That was just probably some side character that's not, didn't know. That's what I saw. That's terrible. That ruins everything. Spoiler alert. I'm happy. Double spoiled. That's a fucking spoiler. Rowanda was one, but he became a weird guy and they're like later in his movies he became like this real overact kind of tied to big, too big. Like where like, you know, it just didn't, didn't matter like he was, it was like always like just trying to sell shit material or something like that. I just wasn't good anymore. But you go back to back to dog day, afternoon. You know how fucking good was he? That was a movie about a transgender Guy, right? Who's got to try and get money for his friend to get a section.

Speaker 1:          01:15:18       That's right. They were robbing a bank and it wasn't based on true story. I don't think so. I think so. That was a great fucking Larry with, he was fucking good back then. God Damn, he was good. It's a Kim and I watched some fucking trailer for a movie. I almost watched it for a goof. It was Deniro and Matt Travolta. No, that was, that was terrible. That was kind of cute. Oh good Lord Kenny. I really did. I bet you did. Worse than that farm. Worse than that was a deniro and Travolta Travolta plays a Russian hitman and deniros like fucking CIA guy. It was one word. Oh my God. He's the worst fucking trailer. Like you watched the trailer and you're like, who green lit this horrible piece of shit that I'm watching here. Yeah. And it doesn't, what happens when the, when the two characters in the movie of that famous that you're watching Dinair we'll chase.

Speaker 1:          01:16:17       Yeah. Travolta. You're not watching a Russian guy chip. Yeah, me with a shitty Russian accent. Terrible killing season. Oh, it's so bad. But like Deniro over the last few years it seems like they just give him movies and he's like, oh, I don't do that. Fuck it. Pay My fee. I'll fucking do it. Yeah. Even that poster looks bad for that. Maybe like, oh, that's so bad. Dude. It's so bad. I would say the Amish beard, I would say play the Empty Ami. I would say play the trailer, but we'll definitely get kicked off of youtube for that fucking trailer. That puts us in hunting and central park. Is that each other? It's such a bad movie. You remember when uh, Deniro did that movie with um, the like he did like a fantasy movie, like one of those fucking wizards source for a movie with, um, what the hell is her name? I'm the chick from the two other though the

Speaker 2:          01:17:10       Sharon Stone. It was, I think it was her and Sharon Stone and Deniro and some awful fucking Unicorn wizard movie. While was that movie that was called paycheck? It was, I mean, what is he spending his money on? How much money is that guy have heat will. It's funny because not as much as you think because there was a whole article a few years ago about him having money problems. Really? Yeah, he and he just bought a bunch of property upstate New York and

Speaker 1:          01:17:39       it is started the US look at it as, fuck. I don't even remember that. He's a wizard or something. I don't even remember that kind of 7.7 and IMD be fuck you. I am DB. Find out what's showgirls has on item 9.7 that's, that's a legitimate right.

Speaker 2:          01:17:57       Good movie because it's so bad. Which one? Show showgirls. Yeah. Legitimately. What was her name like chicken. Elizabeth spoke 4.5 that's it. Outrageous. That's about right. But how does that one have a 7.7 that's 7.7 is almost fucking eight you know, eight is almost nine. Nine is almost perfect. Right? That's horse shit. That's stupid. Train movies. 95% on rotten. What? Train movie as Snow Piercer. Oh yeah. That doesn't make any sense. Did you see that thing Snowpiercer? No. It's one of those indie movies. People like movies that were made for like 50 bucks when they find out movies were made cheap and it was made in house. Oh, these guys made it and you know they, they all got together. They chipped in, they started, they got a Kickstarter. Everybody gets real excited. They did it.

Speaker 1:          01:18:43       Marin's garage where he does his podcast while he was doing it. Then we took behind them.

Speaker 2:          01:18:52       Yeah. It will say they do it in the background. I don't know. I didn't even know about this movie. What did you know that there was a sequel to whatever. That one is called little Fockers where it's just the little bases. That's right. What the fuck are you serious Hoffman? He did meet the Fockers movies. He's been cashing in. He really has. You're right. It wasn't bad in the first one though. The first one wasn't that? No, that was funny. Yeah. It's actually pretty funny. But he's, what was the movie he played? There was a fuck. Um, it was a movie that Deniro did. Resa. Goddamn, and I've got to go to the Deniros IMD last Vegas. The family. Oh, the family wedding. Silver linings playbook. No, no, no. There was a good, it was actually a fairly decent fucking movie. Limitless. He played practical magic. He played some mob guy and um, that's it. The one he said, the family family. I think it's that. I think that's it. The Good Shepherd family. The family was the family. It's kind of a spoof on the mob. No, it was a spoof. Fuck. God dammit. How'd the Godfather, I'm not going to know this. Mm. Not Women

Speaker 5:          01:20:08       List. Not killer elite. Not being freelancers now. Big Wedding. No killing seat. No. That was the one we just talked about. Who Cop land, which was an American house. What the fuck was American hustle? Oh, it was American hustle was in American hustle. Louie was in that, yeah. He was in American hustle to narrow was, yes. Yes. He was good in that. I forget. He was good in that movie. They were trying to set somebody up and um, he, he happened to know a Arabic and the guy was playing like a fake Arab. There was an undercover cop was playing a fake Arab. Oh yeah. Yeah. He was actually good in that. It's like one of the rare American hustle. That was a good, okay. That movie has 7.3 American hustle, which was a great movie. 7.3, those fucking twats they're playing with our emotions and I never saw it.

Speaker 5:          01:20:59       How does that have a 7.3 in the, it's a good fucking movie. American hustle is like an eight or a nine. It's a really good movie. And a, what's her name? Jennifer Lawrence. Oh, good Lord. She's hot and that movie. Yeah, that was a good place. What a good kid she is, Huh? What a good kid. Good kid. Uh, goods coming out of that leak. Uh, I don't, I don't have any problem with that beautiful girl, but yeah, I mean that's a, that's one of the rare movies that he's done over the last few years. It was actually good, but that's what happens, man. That's a weird world. Do you know that world of the aging older actor guy who used to be the iconic movie? There he is. Yeah. He played some fucking God, I forgot about that. That's right. That's right. He was good in it too.

Speaker 5:          01:21:43       It was scary. He was legitimately scary. You give him a good role, he could still knock it out of the park. Oh yeah. Yeah. He's an act that that a bar. Yeah. It's just, I guess it's like not that many good roles for a guy like that or you know, they'd go, hey, we've got this movie. It's independent. Is it stopped click B? That's right. Yeah. He's like, listen, this is Andy, my ass. Dinero for Christ's sake. I got a mortgage. But you mentioned, it's funny. That's an interesting thing, but real successful, famous act as and they get older and then there's a movie right now, right with Michael Keaton about that very thing. You just see that z birdman yet I heard it's really good. Good. Find out what that has on IMD. Be fucking shitbag few website. Yeah, it's those guys, man, they get to a certain age.

Speaker 5:          01:22:29       It's like there's not a lot of roles and women it's way worse because women aren't even scary. 8.7 damn. Birdman respect. Yeah. Um, like a woman like, like Faye Dunaway, they get to a certain age, good fucking luck. Tro He got wasn't a double standard. Yeah. Especially if it's money, you know, it's like a, like a big money movie. Like the, you know, she was on major league movie star, probably making ridiculous amounts of money at that time in her day. And then you get to a certain Angela, hey, we've got nothing for you. You know, you want to work. Like Robin Williams was talking about that before he died. He was talking about why he went back to television and they were saying, you know, just like there's no money. Like, you know, he was in his sixties and people were coming to them with these roles that, you know, weren't that interesting. Or if they were interesting was an independent movies, there's no money involved. And then he started doing standup again. Remember? He did a special, yeah. But standups, one of those things you can't fucking take a decade off and then give

Speaker 4:          01:23:26       back in the saddle. I think a week on week off. Exactly. Isn't weird like that. Absolutely. It's, it's, you know, it's, it's a muscle stand up had said atrophies very quickly and not out there chopping away at it.

Speaker 5:          01:23:39       Yeah. I remember I got knee surgery once. I had to take a few weeks off, took like three weeks off. I had my ACL reconstructed and I went back on stairs and I was nervous as fuck. I was like,

Speaker 4:          01:23:47       I know, isn't it weird? That's how you know, it's still a scary thing to do for a living because when you've been doing it 26 27 years and you're still a little nervous. Yeah. That's when, you know, cause this is still fucking kind of a creepy thing is bring it takes balls. You know what I mean?

Speaker 5:          01:24:03       Especially for me when it gets nerve wracking is like right now because I just released a special, so I have to

Speaker 4:          01:24:09       station wagon about, put it away. It's all gone. I know. That's where you're at now too. Right. Absolutely terrifying. And I don't live in the city. I live 40 miles north of New York City now. I got to drive in and it's a fucking, it's 80 miles a night. It's a real pain in the bottom. It's 11 degrees out. I'm laying my couch trucking, eaten a slice of pizza, and I got 1110 at the seller and you've got to do three sets. I don't buy those days. Well, you know what I'd do? I'd go to the stand, this other club and I do a full half hour. They let me do a full house so I can get something done. And it really came in handy when I, when I did this, another senseless killing. It nicked yp.com stuff for me. Yeah, that's real. Erica stands one of the best ending a billionaire clubs out there.

Speaker 4:          01:24:52       Yeah. It's an, it's an intimate little, it's a small spot. Some nights it's got a really Fifi field too. It's almost like Fifi. Yeah. You don't want a little anything, a little off color. And they're like, Ooh, it gets so angry. He'll say some hateful mean shit. I got fucking liberals. Yeah, well that's true cause nights where I'm absolutely wrong, but there's, but you got to admit, even Chris Rock said, Oh really? He did a whole article how it's not even fun anymore. The kids are so PC and they get fucking Venta and this is coming from a black guy. You think he's going to get in trouble saying anything. Give me a fucking break. Colleges, he was talking about colleges to stop doing those as long time ago. My second year in the business I stopped, don't call Barry Katz sent me to Clark University, which is in Wister. It's even liberal for Massachusetts school. Yeah, and I did some stuff about Middle East and ours is something, some kid goes, what are you going to do a Bush and next of that I said I just winged it much, a hateful a boy and shit and it's the only time I got off early in my life. They fucking hated me.

Speaker 4:          01:25:53       That was like, how does it go? There was like 1991 three years after I started. I, I've done a handful sense now when you do them, they request, I'll do them if they request me and they know what, what's common. I did one upstate

Speaker 5:          01:26:05       cup a couple of years ago, upstate New York and it was surprisingly they were open to anything I was saying. Yeah. Cause he laid on ponies. You need to go to a shitty school. That's her. That's actually a good point. Yeah. If you go to Harvard you're fucked. Oh fuck. I did MIT when we first started, but I had TV clean shit and they liked it. It was really Evie clean. Yeah. Anyway, I wasn't saying anything and they liked it. Well Nick and I came up in the time just after Steven Wright had made it does this big scramble is like that movie standup, one standup stood out. France all need a movie, great fucking movie. It's all about the Boston scene and it's sort of really accentuates what happened in those days because Steven Wright was such a rare talent that he came along and there was all these guys that had been around before him that were just doing it.

Speaker 5:          01:26:51       To be funny. And it was pure, like there was no going anywhere. Like those guys were national level headliners like Sweeney, uh, Nox, Gavin, you know, Kenny, Rodney Clark, all those guys, Mike Donovan, national level headlines, but they never went anywhere. They all stayed in town because all they were trying to do is make each other laugh and like get the respect of each other and kill the crowds. But this fucking guy, Steven Wright came along and his act was so unique and so weird that he got on television and also needs is national huge superstar. And so everybody kind of became like squeaky clean like TV guy. And that's, we came in right when that was happening. You were like a little bit ahead of me and right, right when we came in we were like, why is everybody so how come we can't be, you can't swear

Speaker 4:          01:27:43       what's, well I don't remember Sweeney of a doing that. And he thinks when he needed it. No, no, he just stayed himself. He didn't budge. I'm not doing it. But he was already a huge star in, in Boston, Boston, you know. But, but that's a good point Steven. Right, because the guy from the tonight show, it has happened to be in Boston. This is all part of that movie. When standup stood out, the, the guy that books a comedian for the tonight show back in the 70s when Carson was hosting, it was the thing to do. He was in town looking at schools for his daughter and he saw the Ding Ho ad in the paper and he went to the Ding Hall. That was where the first comedy club, that Chinese restaurant remember. And so he said, I want to go. I'm coming there tomorrow night. So they made up a lineup and almost every comic in Boston went and Steven Wright was in that, in the mix. And he's the only one that didn't do that. Well when the show was over, all the comics went up to meet the guy. They were trying to shake hands with him and, and, and Steven Wright just left cause he did so bad. That's what he says in the, in the movie, and he's the one who got the call.

Speaker 5:          01:28:38       Wow. Well, he was so unique. Yes. That fucking act. When I used to work at a fire hydrant factory, couldn't park anywhere near the police. Isn't that pot material? But when I hear stuff, I'm like, that has to be, we'd material used the best week.

Speaker 4:          01:28:58       Do you know? He lived next to me when I moved, when was in la? I moved a couple times. I moved to Sierra Benita here in West Hollywood and I'm moving to this shitty building. And the guy goes, and this is before anybody who knew Mitch was, or he goes, you're a comedian. How? I go, yeah. He goes, well, this is a standup comedian. He lives right next to you. And I go, well, what's his name? He goes, I don't know, Mitch something, no, whatever. And I'm like, I know, I never fucking heard of them. And then you know about, I'd say a month and a half later, two months later, I'm watching TV. I was on the road somewhere and he and my neighbors on the enlightenment and I go, this guy's is funny as anybody I've ever fucking heard in my life. It's got Scott lives next to me. And then he did a joke about me cause I used to bang on as well.

Speaker 1:          01:29:34       He used to play guitar or his wife or his girlfriend did. They used to have the sing alongs and shit. Not Bang on the wall. Like shut the fuck up. And I'm in shock. Rob. Yeah. And uh, so Zoe from the Improv, so we might, yeah, she was in New York one night. She goes, she was there to help Mitch put his, let him say, she goes, you know, he has a bit, it says Depaulo on the Napkin that says Depaulo on a Napkin. And that's the bit of I'll evening banging on the wall and he goes, there's no door knob come around to some, but something about the door opening and a wall open it. And I love this guy.

Speaker 1:          01:30:12       I'm trying to watch a football game and then fucking they're doing singalongs. Oh, that's hilarious. And a, I just felt so bad. We, I got them. I remember leaving in my case, a Heineken or something. Oh really? Oh that's cool. That's funny man. But it broke my heart. A Guy, he was a guy that got a development deal, like great standup, right? Killer stand up. But then they wanted to put him on TV and put him in the movies and shit. And it just wasn't his thing. His thing was doing what he was doing. But that's the weird thing about Hollywood and stand up. It's just like they take a stand up, they go, man, that you, well you need to do is you need a host, a fucking talk show host and they'll give a stand up, up talk show or give a standup a sitcom and give him some fucking canned lines and reps.

Speaker 1:          01:30:55       Silly. Right. But he, he did it for a little while and then it was like, fuck this took his development deal money bought a cabin in big bear. Is that what he did? I didn't know that. He lives in fucking big bear man. He lived way early. I think she though they still own it. Right? She still owns it. Um, and yeah, he had a cool fucking cabin. He would just go to the mountains and hang out. You know, I was like, Ooh, I liked that guy. I live in a world that seems like comics. We like to do that. I lived in the woods for a while and I live in Colorado. I lived in Colorado. Yeah. My dog had eaten by mountain line. My wife got pregnant.

Speaker 1:          01:31:28       No, I could've killed a mountain lion and we would have been fine. I have set that little fucker up. But uh, the, uh, eight my dog man, but my wife getting pregnant, we were at 8,500 feet above, above boulder, like 3000 feet above boulder and it was really thin air. And you, if you're pregnant up there, that's going to be tough morning sickness is brutal. It was like she had the flu every day, so we had to get out of it. And she did not drive in snow. Well, which one was it, Joe? It was all the above. It was everything. It was, we were isolated, man. We were in the woods and

Speaker 5:          01:32:00       one of our neighbors got it. It's his car eaten by a bear. And when I say, I mean they the fuck fuck the mini coupe. Black bear. No bears. When they smell leather seats, they don't know that that's not food. So the bear, the bear got in. I bet I could find it. I Bet I could find pictures of it. Fascinating. Uh, hold on bear. I got cloth seats, car. My car's fine, Colorado because I saw the pictures online. I was like, you gotta be fucking kidding me or scare the shit out of me and I'd rather get eaten by a shark or whatever the bear thing to me. Yeah. I went Edison's the legends of the fall. I can't sleep. I liked eating bears. I like take good. Get them anymore coyote problems. Joe With you're a chicken. I got coyote. Yeah, I've got 24 I used to have 24 chickens.

Speaker 5:          01:32:49       Now I have 20 fucking does the acid and raise chickens and fucking Kung Fu expert. Fucking crazy motherfucker. I like experiences. Nikta [inaudible] I know you do. Um, I'm just saying, so anyway, this fucking bear in our neighborhood broke into this car and just ate it. I mean, fucking ate the car. Eight to seats eight. The dashboard. I'm trying to find the images. I can't fucking find them online. I should have bookmarked it. It's the craziest fucking thing you've ever seen because I would have think that a bear would. What's that? Oh No. That bed when I was in holy, Jesus fell off of a trampoline and Cheney shot and fell. They tranquilized it and it fell out of the tree. No. And Landon on trampoline. So it just started bouncing. Yeah, that's true. I saw it. Really? Is there a video? It'll probably get us pulled from youtube.

Speaker 5:          01:33:41       Really? Yeah. There's people that own those videos. They get make money off the ads. So if you play them on a podcast, they put you in copyright. The Xing really? And it's a pain in the tech man is a real pain. Anyway, this fucking bear just absolutely completely mauled this guy's car. And my wife was freaking out about that too because the fact that these fucking giant animals and they weren't even that big. They were, they were black bears. Yeah. That's, what is that one that did it? What was it, a salmon and Terry as this another, uh, it happens all the time because of people and national parks leaving like sandwiches and their cars and stuff and that period blood hearts period. Blood bears are so fucking powerful. When we went bear hunting, I was with my friend Cameron Hanes and we were on the ground maybe 20 feet or 20 yards rather in front of these fucking two bears that were fighting.

Speaker 5:          01:34:31       I wouldn't do, it was the craziest shit ever. It was like watching a UFC with bears. It was a male bear trying to get to the female and her cubs. The cubs, when they see a male bear, they run up trees. Male bears eat cubs. It's one of the first things. You don't want to be anywhere near a female bear and her cubs. Exactly. Exactly. Exactly. Yeah. Well we couldn't move once we were there. You. Last thing I want to do is run. You don't even want to back up. Not like if I lay down

Speaker 1:          01:34:58       and it's a big thing about bears is about, it's about, um, it's about, um, uh, body language. If you back up your prey, you're their dominance. You'll give them the finger. You have to stand up. If bears come near you, you have to stand up and you have to move towards. You don't play dead. You have to get up and go like this. Are you going to do that? Really? We did. You have to. If you don't do it, you get fucking eaten. And I'm not bullshitting. They ate a kid in Rutgers just I know the Indian kid and then I made a joke about a shitting in the woods. Well, he does now. He Ate Indian. Oh, how dare you. Spicy Curry. That kid took pictures too. You saw the pictures? Yup. Yup. People like to take selfies with bears. That's my worst nightmare. I'd rather a shock or a cramp there.

Speaker 1:          01:35:43       People have a lot of weird ideas about what bears are. They have these ideas that somehow the bears like these cute little cuddly forest creatures that are eating berries grew up that way. Teddy bears, we should not give kids a teddy bear. The teddy bear. True. Well especially like what would you do for a Klondike Bar? Yeah, fucking polar bears and Coca Cola bears. This is a real fucking coca cola bear. That's what they do. Those goddamn polar bears. All they eat is meat, deer or something like that. Now how does he get the blood off his for? He doesn't go swimming. We'd go to the cleaners. Gab, he swims or you just walked around with blood all over his face like a fucking g. He doesn't give a shit. It wasn't carried. It looks like he's a polar bear. There's blood on my coat there had goddamn terrifying you animals.

Speaker 1:          01:36:31       We played the video, didn't we have the guy that was in that big plastic box? The giant Plexiglass, some guy from the BBC sets up this box. That's huge. Bulletproof steel reinforced box in polar bear country and this giant fucking polar bear comes over and he's trying to get him. He's trying to eat the box and he's huge fucking mouth in this. Guys inside this box, shit, his pants shaking the box. You realized how strong those fucking things I, that's like I said, I'd rather be in a shark cage. Have you ever seen the video? I don't think so. Playing that video. Just play him on this. Can you play it on that Jamie? She's fucking right. You have to see it. Cause it's, he's fucking God damn terrifying is there's so many animals out there that are just unbelievably powerful and terrifying. And we have these ideas about them based on like cartoons. Oh yeah, he and booboo. You know like all the like really scary ones. Like polar bears. Oh, how about this pad? Vicious toe. They're vicious. Yeah. Koala beavers and got, got killed by a fucking beaver this year. But that was an era of disease.

Speaker 1:          01:37:37       You have a fucking comic to the bone. The bone. All right, because at the bear, no, that's, that's white guy. Oh. Oh Hey skip ad. See that button. Click that. It goes, look at this, this fucking guy in this thing. And if Brian, what is the name of this for folks who want to watch dumb? Fuck. It's called starving polar bear. BBC. We'll bring it up. Oh God. So this is Jack Ass decides he's going to sit in this, this big glass and you know, bulletproof glass and steel box and this bear just goes right to them. No fear. Enormous animal. Probably fucking, you know, 1300 1400 pounds. Who the size of this fucker? Yeah, that's a, Oh God damn. It freaks me out. Look at the cute little face and then he's going to bite your head off. No, just holy Jesus. Well you don't even know. Wait till he gets up there. He's just smelling it right now. He knows there's meat inside there. So he starts getting really close and then he starts trying to bite it. Look at this. This is where it gets really crazy. He starts pushing it. This guy, he's tightening down the latches and you make sure a good time to tighten the meal. I want to know how they even test it with the size of that. Fuck you gotta be shitting me. How did they even test this thing? It's trying to get him, I mean, he's trying to open that thing up and get him

Speaker 6:          01:39:09       this guy.

Speaker 1:          01:39:13       What are the only animals that actually see us as food?

Speaker 1:          01:39:18       Yeah. I would want a gun. I wonder if he's got a gun in there. You have to have some kind of backup. Right? Just in case. If it does happen, I would hope someone who's filming that from a distance has something like bear spray or something. He'd look at the site, hope trying to hug him. He's clawing at the fucking look at that. Oh God. Jesus Christ. Yeah, because they're not like even grizzly bears. They'll eat berries and grass and they'll lead all sorts of plants, but not, and then wash it down with human blood. Polar bears don't have anything around except meet. All they're doing is just eating seals and the occasional hiker. Yeah. They, they creep me out more than I think they should, but meanwhile I look at this asshole swimming with one. The guy who's got his own pet look at that. Oh yeah. That's fucking jackass. And I went to school in Maine. They had fences up along the campus to keep the bears off the railing. Yeah, but those are brought black bears, right? They're still dangerous. Apparently black bears are more likely to kill people than brown bears. Just Brown. You just being racist. Ah, what am I saying?

Speaker 1:          01:40:23       Apparently black bears will eat people more often than a brown bears will. Black, brown bears are just bigger and stronger. Brown bears will avoid you apparently more than black bears. Well,

Speaker 6:          01:40:34       yeah,

Speaker 1:          01:40:34       but New Jersey especially has a real fuck. I know they got to Reno. It was just going to, I mean, I live in Westchester. What's the difference? And you, why'd you move out to Westchester? What made you want to live out there? Honest to God, no tunnels and old bridges on the way into the city. That is nice. But the property taxes are through the roof and it's, but I love it. I love it. Oh yeah.

Speaker 2:          01:40:54       It's the worst in the country really. One of the words were mentioned like five different articles on the New York Times, but you were in like, that's what part of Westchester I'm up without telling anybody because people will stalk you up by the, uh, by like Chappaqua area. Briar cliff. I was listening to you on a res podcast. He was talking about your neighbor. Huntsman is falling back yard. Yeah. Sometimes they'll look out the window and he'll be like walking through our ag and a deer blood shit. Love this guy. Love this guy. Does he bring over meat? He gave me a venison roast for Christmas. Really? Yeah. I love this guy. I'm not yet. No, a couple of days ago they were late exchanging gifts but uh oh that's cool. I love that shit. Oh yeah. I mean, and we have the same thing. I got a small dog and we have coyotes at, you know, let the dog out at night.

Speaker 2:          01:41:43       You're going to go out and clap and applaud to keep the willing. Yeah. To let the coyotes no, you there and shit. Apparently they say there's like a certain, like things he could set up that make us sound a certain sound that coyotes don't like and you set them up and they can keep a lot of the coyotes out. But they're smart. Those little fuckers, they, they figure shit out. They recruited my dog. That's how I'm really, yeah, that's how he got away with killing one of my chickens. He became my dog's friend. Like they go around my dog and you know, they would like play I guess like outside the fence. And my dog would bark at them and wag his tail when he sees them. Oh my God. Yeah. And when, uh, he killed a chicken and ran off with my dog, killed a chicken to my dog, had broken into the side of my yard where the coyote was.

Speaker 2:          01:42:27       Some of the left, one of the gates open. We have two gates and one of the gates you could Kinda, he could shake it with his paw and he could open it up and he figured it out. And so he ran over there to hang out with his pal and go on a fucking, uh, an orgy of slaughter. Was it you or whoever Burt or whatever that said something about the, the, the coyote limping that was trying to trick, uh, oh yeah, yeah, yeah. That was actually, I'm not even us. That was a, the [inaudible] scholar. Butters. Yeah. We were all hanging out in the back of the comedy store and they were telling us that Pete was a PDC. He, I parked up in the hill behind the comedy store, which is a lot of comics do they part way up in this huge hill, cause there's like a street that they can park on and then walk down the hill.

Speaker 2:          01:43:07       And he said he was getting out of his car and there was a coyote limping. That was, he was like, oh my God, why is this coyote limping? And he's just kind of nervous. He's like, I'm just going to let this coyote walk by me. And then suddenly this pack of coyotes just started walking past him. Like I said, they were doing the exact same thing with the limping. They set it up where they make it look like they're hurt and they were like, well, they'll limp. So it's her job. She used to do videos to get girls. Yes. He would pretend he was hurt or kill his dude. They be, can they have a cast on their arm and they're on crutches? I remembering the Ted Monday, I didn't know he did. That girl comes over to help him. He's trying to put a couch in the back of a van. He's pretending he's got like a cast on his hand. The girls kind of salt lamps. That's like, that's like a, that's prepay. I didn't know. I thought that was a human thing.

Speaker 5:          01:43:52       I didn't know. I didn't know animals were doing. They fake a limp. Yeah, they fake a limp and they'll also become friends with your dog and then my neighbor, he has like a beagle little beagle and he says every time the coyotes come near his house, the beagles starts wagging its tail. I think it's the coyote is his friend and if they can get the dog outside and they just maul it and kill it, it did creepy. Well he thought it was just they smelled it and fucking attacked it. No, they're smart man. They developed tactics. Well you know, they're similar in a lot of ways to wolves and wolves have a lot of like crazy tricks that they do to uh, to get animals. We'll set up ambushes like wolves will, they'll funnel like elk and deer until like a path. And then the weight, they'll have other wolves waiting.

Speaker 5:          01:44:33       I don't how the fuck they work this out. I don't know how they, the internet email, what did they do that lets them figure out that this is a good strategy and how do they know like who's going to be the chaser? Who's going to be the guy that waits, you know, how do they coordinate this? But I guess when you're fucking starving and the only way you get food is to kill it with your face like you, you work shit out and the streets. Martin's why it is kind of street smart. Think of a crazily fake limping. I'd, I'd never heard that. That's unbelievable. They have a real problem. This one, a retirement community, there's been some insane amount, like more than 30 over the last year, uh, coyote attacks because they figured out in Arizona, they figured out that old people are fucking old. You know the Kyries realize this guy's not gonna stop me from genus dog.

Speaker 5:          01:45:21       And so they just run up and snatch dogs right off the leash. They'll literally wait for someone to be walking their dog, the weight, and they'll see the guy with the dog and then just run, run right out half the number of 10 or 11 you wouldn't walk your dog and I fucking air. Well, especially if you live in fucking Arizona where you can carry a gun gun, do whatever you would walk. Like Arizona is a open carry state. You don't even have to have a concealed carry permit. You can do whatever the fuck you want and you can keep a gun, your underwear, you do whatever you want. No helmet and gun on your mouth. No helmet on the motorcycle and gun coyotes loved the smell of absorbing Jr. Just walk your dog by a motorcycle while you're armed. Yeah, that's it. Just, just slowly all over the neighborhood.

Speaker 5:          01:46:02       Just idle and just start unloading shotgun shells on these fucking country. While I really wish we could get a motorcycle. I wish we didn't live in la cause it's so tempting to give me my money. Are we riding together? Like what do you got planned? Going to get a side conference. I get with those goggles on because there's so many people at the comedy store. They're getting new motorcycles lately and it's just so like, and it's not that expensive. I thought motorcycles where like the price of a car. They're not that bad. No, it's not bad at all. Dean Dean is always a ride in his, I don't trust del Rey. Yeah. That's a fucking dope motorcycle. He got to that fat Harley Davidson. That thing's amazing. Police car won yet. He has a police motorcycle. Police motorcycle. It's cool. Oh yeah, they'll load. It's kind of like sorta police colors. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:46:49       With a side car. Side bags on it that things may, I asked him about it. I go, dude, that thing's amazing. I go, do you have close calls? He goes, all the time. I got kids. Well Louie, I was living with Louis in New York right after we moved to different places. He got a bike and and sure enough man, like after, after like three weeks, he was doing like 60 down, you know, by Columbus. So when it goes, gets hit going through her fucking intersection, you get t boned. I mean, could have been killed, login easily. He got hit hard flying, got knocked out. I almost got a bike. I was going through the motorcycle training thing and everything. I was going with a couple friends of mine and they wound up getting bikes. But two people I know gotten some pretty serious accidents. Uh, a buddy of mine fell.

Speaker 1:          01:47:35       He was going through the canyons and he fell and fucked his shoulder up. And then another friend, Frank Mir was the UFC, one of the UFC champions. You got hit by a fucking car and got launched 60 feet in the air. Some old man just ran a red light. So looking to hit the gas and shattered his femur. That's the thing. It's, it's not you, it's the, he almost lost his leg people, the other people drive and they don't trust. Exactly right. Exactly. I mean, crashing your bike if you're going fast can be fatal for sure. But most accidents occur because you're involved with another vehicle, you know, unless you're driving like a psycho. I mean, but it's even tempting just to be like, you know what, I'll just drive around my house, my neighborhood, you know, like, I'll just go to the store instead of doing nothing on the freeway, I got an alley to go pick up a sandwich.

Speaker 1:          01:48:18       What's so fun? They are fun. I mean, you think about it, you go to, I think about this when I go, uh, to, uh, like, like Disneyland with my kids and I'll get any stupid fucking go karts. I'm like, look, you know, I, I gotta go cart. You know, I got it. I got a sports car to drive it fast. Like this is not that fun for me. This is stupid. But like a motorcycle like around your neighborhood is just like going on a ride at Disneyland. You know. If it's fun to go on a ride at Disneyland, it's way more fun to be riding around your neighborhood on a motorcycle. It'd be really fun. Just convince yourself though it Joe. But what's worse is those guys that I think feel the same but they get those like for motorcycle, like where it's like a grown man, like a white guy with one of those four wheel motorcycles driving down the street. Yeah, they should be. Yeah. You should be off in the woods with that thing and can be in the woods in Tennessee with that thing. Checking out your shine. See if somebody broke into the hut funding your trap line. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:49:17       Those things get people fucked up. You know those for a lot of paralyze people didn't Ozzy Osborne break his back doing one of those problems, they fall over on you. The problem with those, it's different than a motorcycle. Like if you slide in a motorcycle, if you're falling, you let the bike slide and you know you get rug rash or road rash rather. But on those things, a lot of times people want them getting trapped under him. They get crushed. There's so goofy looking too though. When you see a guy driving down the street in that though they're real dangerous. If you hit a bump, if like you hit a bump with like your side and you know

Speaker 5:          01:49:48       it flips over on top of you, you might get crushed and know you might get your body cavity caved in. Here's trail Ellen. Yeah. What is he doing? He doesn't have a helmet on Jesus Christ. Let's see Chris. That's football injuries, Goddamn head injuries. He's had two wheels in the front and one in the back. Those are apparently more stable for some reason. I don't understand why the hell is that. That's like one of those things. They have two wheels in the front and one in the back. I wonder if because it has all those wheels, you don't need a helmet. Is that or is that like in a place where you need a helmet? You don't need a helmet. A lot of fucking states still don't have helmet laws, you know?

Speaker 2:          01:50:25       Yeah. It's sunglasses and lie to play like you have to have sunglasses on, which is smart. That is the law of bug or a pebble. I mean, you know, pebble hit your windshield 50 miles an hour. Dean used to always say the worst is when you're behind somebody and somebody flicked a cigarette out and it'll go right into your coat. Inner driving and it just like, you don't know what to do. He says that happens all the time. It's cigarette fuck. Rarely. Yeah, I see the little marble counter. How many times can that happen? I mean it happens all the time on the road. I see people throw cigarettes out there. The car out here all the time. When the lead man, he used to have a joke about that. Remember, what was it? She goes, I don't throw my cigarettes out the car window. Cause last time I did the car behind me blew up. Well, I always think that it was the best job that though. Right? Like you do somewhere inside your engine it's going to go on the tank, get in there and fucking lights. It's all gasoline and shit.

Speaker 5:          01:51:17       Well not only that, in La you have to be a real asshole to do that cause it only rains once a year. Here, everything's dry as fuck. You know you can start fires. They say all those roadside fires, they all get started by people flicking flicking a bunch out the window. That's pretty sweet. That is pretty,

Speaker 2:          01:51:33       that looks awesome. Three wheeler duck thing. It looks like a car tire and it looks like you could front could be the back in the back. Could be that you could go either way on. Do you know how many you can lay down this way? It's a bisexual cycle. It goes both ways. It's like corvette size tires. Look why those fucking tires are, that seems like that would be

Speaker 5:          01:51:56       no, not that stable. Yeah. I mean I, yes, I mean, isn't the idea that you kind of like lean,

Speaker 2:          01:52:02       where do you drive that people drive that shit all through La. Like I see it all the time. Yeah. Not this exact one. Is that legal?

Speaker 5:          01:52:10       Yeah. Yeah. I don't know. I mean, how was it? Motorcycle legal. It's weird. Like motorcycles illegal, but you have to, you get a ticket if you have a seat. No seat belt on. Like I'm inside a metal box guys. He's like sitting on that thing just sitting, sitting and holding on with his hands. You know you could ride a motorcycle by the way, if you have one hand. How about that? How about you have one hand and a, you're just sitting on it and I have two hands inside a box and I can get a ticket if I don't have a strap around me.

Speaker 2:          01:52:40       Another big thing in Burbank is this legal golf carts. People just drive shit around era in

Speaker 7:          01:52:46       Burbank all the time. It was like two or three people just driving down the street and golf carts. Boy, they living on life at a breakneck pace. Huh? What the fuck? Really? Yeah, and there's a lot that's become popular I think because just the gas mileage, you know? Well, they're all illegal. I mean rather, right? They're all electric. I don't, I don't know this. Is that the future out of them electric carts? Yeah. Well fuck the spot at all. Give me my pickup truck. These fucking electric cars they're making now, they're slowly starting to get better gas mileage or distance. So they under $100,000. No, they're probably the Tesla's the good ones. I mean you get like a Prius, but those are ugly. That's what I want to get behind two broads in a golf cart.

Speaker 5:          01:53:27       I'm late for an audition. No gears. Just a s steady buzz and 35 miles an hour when they're pushing it. Yeah. They got a new Tesla that goes 400 miles. That's like the newest, latest, greatest one. They have a, an upgrade to their little roads. Dirk was 400 miles, but that's still not that long, man. 400 miles on a charge. No. Some shit hits the fan.

Speaker 7:          01:53:51       Isn't that just the guy just get divorced and now he owes, he's paying the girl like $20 million or something like Elon Musk don't prenups work. Uh, what every be I hear about a prenup and I'd never worked

Speaker 5:          01:54:03       can test them for sure. And a lot of times when people can test prenups or any kind of lawsuit, people settle because you took costs like, yeah. Cause of the UFC right now has a Elon Musk divorce makes it most eligible again. Okay. If she has got divorced he would who do

Speaker 7:          01:54:20       and she were received 16 million. Yeah, she deserves, because she helped with that company.

Speaker 5:          01:54:26       She was stuck in that sweet 16 every dog tick Joe. That's sexy. That's misogynist. You're going to get to know I was raised in the 60s I didn't know any better. I don't know any better. When I grew up, my formative years all occurred before the Internet and social justice. I didn't know I was raised on James Cagney movies. I don't know any better and I wish I could think about those fucking electric cars is you've got to get those goddamned batteries from somewhere and all that, all that shit from those batteries. A lot of it comes from like where it called conflict minerals. It's comes from Africa, comes from like the, I'm fucking slaves pulling it out of the ground. Like that's, that's the big dirty secret cell phones. Yeah. Lithium, lithium ion batteries. A lot of that shit comes from either Africa or a big, a big supply they found recently in Afghanistan. Like they're going to, they're going to be sending people to mind. I'm sure a lot of chemicals over there. Yeah. They, a lot of shit in the ground. Minerals, lots of minerals, a lot of natural gas. No roads, no toilet. Yeah. And you know what they say also in places where electricity is made by coal, it actually is worse for the environment to get your electricity to power a car and then use it with a cold fat Pi fired, uh, electrical

Speaker 2:          01:55:44       plant than it is to just burn gas because the gas they have now, like if you have certain, what does that, Jon Jones has a gas, but no, what he tests positive for cocaine enters rehab. No Way. That just happened. No, John John's test positive for cocaine enters rehab. Oh my goodness dude. Now wait a minute. Hold on. When you do, cause it's going to ask you that. That was the next question. I don't think that stays in your system very long. 30 days, 20 days, something like that. It's very short. Is it that long? I thought it was like 30 hours or something crazy like that. Maybe I'm thinking 30 hours, but that's fucked. Let me call shortly after we fight like that. I wonder if he loses his title.

Speaker 2:          01:56:34       Quote from Dana. I am proud of John Jones from making the decision to enter a drug retreatment facility. He stated, I'm confident that he'll emerged from this program like the champion. He truly is. Okay. That's a good thing to say. I like to talk to him on the phone, find out what he really thinks. We're going to have an interesting conversation that I can't talk to people about it. That's exactly right. I mean that's great. Maybe celebrated the big victory now I'm hoping. No, no way. No Way. Cause they test them after the fight. Like right after the fight. They test him before the fight or right after, right after December drug test it says, oh they didn't put the rest of my coat. So yeah, I wonder what happens is they tell us is going to be, you know what? Come on. I don't know about that because he won. I mean it's probably a a non decision like it's probably like a somehow, I don't know. Vacate the belt man. Yeah, they that cocaine you can't be, here's how you fix it. Here's how you fix this. So you have a rematch match math with they both coked up. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          01:57:37       It's a pretty common that he was doing blown. He's still one. How about that? How about Scott? He's, oh, he's the most bad ass ever test positive for cocaine metabolites. It's brother with the patriot. Best Pass rusher. They have, it's a mayor and a couple of tough mothers. Family develop some stud athletes. Did they ever, this is a, this is really strange man, that just happened. This is cold being with the Rogan when the news breaks. You're great at that yet I'm not kissing your ass. Be Really, oh thanks man. I was watching like a year ago and it was some guy getting the shit kicked out of him and you go, um, yeah, but the guys getting a little cocky, I don't know who was winning the fight. He goes, he's getting a little too cocky and you didn't even 10 seconds after that he get the guy get knocked out. You're the albums. Yeah. Wow. This is crazy. This is really crazy. Um, Nevada state commission falls the world antidoping agency code and um hmm. This, he tested positive for Benzos. Xylem

Speaker 5:          01:58:43       going nine. The main metabolite and cocaine. That's the soul. So by saying that that's a metabolite and cocaine, it means what you're talking about, like really trace shit, really trace shit and he's already gotten busted in a Dui.

Speaker 7:          01:59:01       What do you mean really trace Josh's small, very, very small amount

Speaker 5:          01:59:04       mounds.

Speaker 8:          01:59:05       Well, get this big ups with Jon Jones Body. Oh Shit, it's begun.

Speaker 7:          01:59:13       Starts Wow. Trace amounts of cocaine. I mean he could have just lik day CD, CD or something. Yeah. You could have had money. Some monies.

Speaker 5:          01:59:25       Yeah. You got to have some, they sit in the window sill, like an x amount of a percentage of like a hundred dollar bills have money.

Speaker 7:          01:59:32       Yes. When I worked at a record store, we would get, people would come in to sell their cds and I just remember I would pick out once and it was just white dust over and I'm like, all right, we'll buy this one and he would scrape them together and we didn't know what we're doing. We were just like, dude, it has to be okay. What other white shit would be on a CD and Hilkiah. Right.

Speaker 5:          01:59:55       Wow. Yeah. Maybe they would get like people that are like blondie fan.

Speaker 8:          01:59:59       They want it to die. It was just sell them. She showing tits in her video.

Speaker 5:          02:00:08       Well, I am proud of that Mr. Jones is addressing the issue. Oh, okay. Friends bow. Yeah. Well he got tested December 4th okay. That's a almost a month before with the support of my family. I've entered into drug treatment facility. I want to apologize to my fiance, my children as well, my mother, father and my brothers making a mistake that I made. I also want to apologize to Yossi my coaches. My sponsor's equally pointing my fans. I am taking this treatment program very seriously. Therefore at this time my family and I would appreciate privacy. Hmm. And Bet you what? Well you know what man? The dude is having a good fucking time. That's what's going on. He's the baddest motherfucker on the planet. He's partying up a storm. Like someone said something to me like, you know, all those crazy behavior and all this wild shit that he's doing. And I was like, listen, you got to be a wild motherfucker to be to do that. Your baddest dude on the planet, you really do. And John Jones essentially when it comes to MMA is the baddest motherfucker on the planet. I mean, he just beat Daniel Cormier who was a Strikeforce Grand Prix champion who trains on a regular basis, holds his own with the heavyweight champion Cain Velasquez. He said, you know, in a heartbeat he would fight the heavyweight champion and he might be able to beat a man who the fuck knows. I mean, he might be a better fighter if he wasn't losing weight to get down to two oh five and doing coke

Speaker 7:          02:01:30       202 to four days. It's why does it last in the system? Yeah. Okay. So that means, so if we look at his two, we look at John Jones Twitter on December 1st or December or November 29th we'll see exactly where he's like, you know, hanging out where he was on the boat. It was, how could the cop over there fucking this fucking very clever. He's just Christ. Take it easy there, right? Yeah. Thank you.

Speaker 8:          02:01:55       Quincy. You and I just hope dated each other. Might as well have said Sherlock Holmes. Charlie has a hardy party boys.

Speaker 7:          02:02:09       Oh my God. I was trying to think of a Goddamn detective division. Can imagine it. Really. It's fucking sad, Joe. Okay, let's go to John Jones Twitter page December. Okay, that's fine. John Jones cut to him with his face in a pair of stripper did.

Speaker 5:          02:02:23       Yeah. Jones. All right. What do you think? December. How far back you gotta go?

Speaker 7:          02:02:29       So I'm so December, wait, the test was December 4th is that what it said? So I would say I would go December 2nd or first.

Speaker 5:          02:02:36       Oh, we try now. Let's go deep. Let's go deep into the honey hole. All right. December 20th two two two, two, two tweets a lot. Okay.

Speaker 7:          02:02:43       He just got back from Brazil, came over. Cause now it says by Brazil sky just figured the whole thing. Oh, the Brian. Yup. Holy Shit. That's how it happened. Yeah. And, and you know what, because it's trace amounts, I will bet you that it was probably something that's common that he maybe he went to a restaurant and they had like a coca leaf or there was some kind of weird like thing, well, I'm going to throw another theory that, how about when a call me, his people was over there and sprinkled in here, right? Oh well we're Vember 30th that's real thinking. So he got tested on November 4th December four date, December 4th rather. So he has four days for it to get. Yeah, about four days. I'm going to start doing that shit again. Yeah, I didn't know that either. It looks like is the most likely culprit. Absolutely. Boy, you guys put that together really quick. The time partying up a storm. Yeah. Here's the actual quote he says by Brazil. Thank you so much for the great time. Now back to the bootcamp and that was November 30th

Speaker 5:          02:03:44       hmm. Yup. And there's a trail of blood going up. The plain stuff. What it is, the little sprinkles on his Reebok's. Wow. Why laces bloody what? Wow. They get in a fight with him when he's coked up. How about the fact that he was partying and doing blown? He's still beat the best guy on the planet per sale, man. You're hanging out with that kind of, but you're doing cocaine off of it. You know, that's some hot chicks out there having a good time. You gotta be a wild motherfucker man show. That's why I don't frequent those places anymore. Yeah. Brazil or places. Sure. He never been in Brazil. No beautiful place, man. But the, the, the contrast between poverty and wealth is very shocking. They're like right next to you, right? Well, not only that, they're, you know, all the Hollywood hills, all the rich people live in the hills and there were regular folks live there. It's

Speaker 1:          02:04:38       the opposite in, in Brazil. All the poor people in the hills with his amazing view of the ocean. And then all the Rashid had lived down on the bottom. Yeah. So like they would have problems. They've cleaned up a lot of it, but they'd have problems in the, people would leave the favelas and rob people and then go back to the five Ellis. You know the favelas, like there's some like extreme poverty and they were really mad. They had the most like the worst homeless population on the planet a few years ago. Yeah, it can get bad and some spots, but it's also like they're really nice people. Like Brazil is fun, man. I really love used to go there. The food is fantastic. They have those two Haas Korea's, you know where they have the Brazilian barbecue? It's like they cut the, yeah, they have it here. You know, you ever go on the phone with me and Patrice late.

Speaker 1:          02:05:26       Great. Patrice O'neil. We used to go. When you're doing short, he's watching shorties and he brought me to that place. I go, dude, and this is when he know he had like diet. I'm like, what are you doing man? The guy's coming on this. Yeah. He didn't give a fuck. He just ate is eight and fucked up his body. But in Brazil, they got real mad because they spent so much money on the fucking World Cup, millions and millions and millions of dollars to make these fucking stadiums and bringing all these people in with all the poverty. Right? I'm like, what the fuck? Where are you guys getting this money? You assholes. You could have been, you know, putting these kids through school and giving people food and it's a mess. It's a mess. But illegal and, uh, Brazil office, this isn't it.

Speaker 1:          02:06:07       Not banning competition in Brazil. He sang it in UFC. It's not bad. Oh, it isn't. Okay. The metabolites are not banned. That's what it is. The metabolite. It's not illegal. It's like if you have a marijuana metabolites in your system, like now it's legal. Like there's a certain amount of metabolites. You're allowed to have it. You, he, they changed it by like a large number. And it used to be, it was like you could have like a trace amount of marijuana in your system and they could, uh, take your money away and find you and take your victory away. Like that's happened before, like with Nick Diaz that happened, but now, um, now you, you could have quite a bit more. As long as you're not high when you're fighting, that's what they want now. They think, think you should be allowed to smoke pot to relax after training and all that shit.

Speaker 1:          02:06:52       But marijuana stays in your system because it's fat soluble way longer, like seven weeks. Whereas, um, with coke it's like, oh, a couple of fucking days. I can tell you my marijuana story when I came home from a dance club one night right after I just, before I started doing comedy, he was living in Malden, Granada highlands up on the hill there. Those are nice about it. Yeah. I come from the palace by pilots and Sagas. Yes. We lived like a half a mile from it. Okay. I come home, my buddies all, when I come home, shit faced, there's a thing get tomato sauce and it's like one in the morning, I'm starving. I make spaghetti, I eat enough for like five people. Okay. I wake up like an hour later and my ears are ringing in the rooms going like this. I started puking violently.

Speaker 4:          02:07:36       I hit my buddies, come in, I'm in the bathroom, I hear them going to the kitchen, they go, he ate all the fuck and they made Rasta Pasta and they ate this much of it. They said they ate like, you know, a tiny amount. They were fucked up all night. And this is a guy who I only get high at that point a couple times in my life and that now my roommate's talking to me. Right. He's right where you at? He's like five feet away, but it sounds like he's yelling from a mile away. I was tripping on the fucking, they were going to take me. They didn't know if they should take me to the hospital. I'm fucking puking. I'm swearing at them and, and, and honest to God, it was a week later, I remember watching the Superbowl and still being fucked up. I don't, cause it's so much like you just said when you went, when you ingest it orally, it's way stronger and, and, and it little resent my system.

Speaker 4:          02:08:24       I don't know how long. I mean, you know, you can look it up, but I, and this is from somebody who didn't, I didn't smoke a lot of weed. That's crazy. A week later. Oh, at least a week weekly. No, at least I'm probably being conservative with that because it stays in, if you saw how much I ate, you know, if you saw how much tomato sauce, such a grease ball and, and uh, and they were like, they were fucked up all my was like this much. And they were like, oh no, you're making up the fingers. Like a hockey puck. Yeah. Forget I'm not on TV, but yeah, about half the size of a hockey. But it, and I was sitting there like, you know, and my ears were ringing and they would, like I said, my roommate's like that close to me and it sounded like he was yelling down the hallway. I was tripping on the fucking THC or whatever it is.

Speaker 5:          02:09:07       Yeah, it's a 11 hydroxy metabolite is what happens when you, the THC passes through the liver and which they think was most of the way people used to eat. Well they used to take hash and eat it back in the day and that's like responsible for like a lot of the psychedelic writing and then the, the rig Veda and all the Hindu scriptures. A lot of that was written while they were on eating marijuana. Eating catalyst. Yeah. It's like it's very psychedelic when you eat a lot of it, you trip your fucking balls off. It's not like smoking pot. You could smoke a lot of pot. You just get really high. But when you eat it, oh it does really crazy things. I was a fucking match. I didn't feel right forever. When you closed your eyes, you see nutty shit like hallucinate.

Speaker 4:          02:09:49       I don't remember that. I do remember the voices though. Well No. Somebody talking to me being that close and it sounded like they were yelling down the hallway. It was freaking me out. I'm not a drunk guy in a little blow like anybody else. Your whole system has been so fucked up. That's so much like I get scared here when people talk about stuff like that. Like I start getting nervous. My hands are sweaty right now. That's what I'm saying. What's the stuff you do? I want to hear more about this.

Speaker 5:          02:10:16       Dimethyltryptamine the thing about DMT is it, it, it leaves your body really quick. Like 15 minutes later it's gone.

Speaker 4:          02:10:24       But how long, how long are you on that? Uh, will hi will you will your, it's your sober in 15 minutes. Rarely. Yeah. I might try the cit tonight. It breaks your brain though. No, it does.

Speaker 1:          02:10:34       It does. What? He doesn't ever done it and his brain is broken. So don't know. Joe Seems pretty fine. Expanded his horizons and trust me your, you'll be fine. I heard you talking about it. One of those specials you would taking questions and answers after and you would just explain the shit. I was in my car listening on the radio. I was coming home from a Gig and I go, Holy Shit, I almost want to try this stuff. Well, it's a good thing to try and that it's over quick. I took Tony Hinchcliffe, we did it allegedly in Austin, Texas die. No, no, he's alive. He's doing well. But it's um, it's like I can't explain it and you can't explain it. You just did great that night when I was listening. How it changes your perception of everything. It definitely does that. It definitely changes your perception of everything. How about your marriage? Did it, I don't think it had any effect on that.

Speaker 5:          02:11:25       Does honestly is it shows you that there's more that like, supposedly there's like multiple dimensions that exist simultaneously all around us. We only exist in this dimension. This is like what physicists believe. You know, there's like 11 different dimensions and it's probably that we just don't have the sensory dep. We don't have the sensory perception abilities to perceive these things. Like if you took a, an aunt and you know, you fucking held a book over the aunt's head, do you think they know that there's letters over there, they don't understand what the fuck you're doing. Like they don't need to be able to perceive that. We have developed and evolved with, uh, our abilities are perceiving what's in front of us all the time, whether it's hunting and gathering or recognizing enemies. Like that's where all of our senses come from. Our hearing, our feeling or touch to have sex, make more people to know when you're hungry, all those different things. But it's very likely that there's a lot of shit around us all the time that we just can't take in. And this neuro chemical that your brain produces when you take it in large doses, it allows you a very brief but incredibly potent window into what's likely there all the time.

Speaker 1:          02:12:39       But what do you see? What do you seeing visually is the change that, to describe it to you? Oh yeah, you're, the world dissolves, you know, you, you live in a word. Some of that

Speaker 5:          02:12:48       can of jesters and bike lights that are indescribable geometric patterns that are just infinite fractal. They go on forever and it's the most potent thing

Speaker 1:          02:13:01       could ever explain. I would never show it to you and it like an Alex Gray painting. This is like a little clarity. Yeah. Well, this guy does all of his shit while he's a paint doesn't mean doubt. Jon Jones, a prom picture. It's snowball king is when it says on his, uh Oh no it doesn't. That's supposedly real. Well he lived in New York, man had a snow ball battle. That's true. Be Rude Brian. Seriously, this is the kind of shit that you say. Literally she should see shit like that. I'll go a rug store. That's how fucked gray. Oh my. He paints that when he's, when he's tripping on that shit. I mean he's a what you would call a visionary artist and he is a very well versed in tryptamine experiences, but he's the best at like capturing those uh, those images. And you saw stuff like that.

Speaker 1:          02:13:47       Exactly like that. Like almost exactly like you see shit like that. But it's like moving and turning into itself and unbelievable. Like, I mean, but humbling. Like you get out of it and you'd just have a different view of the world. Like your view of the world just completely alters forever. You've done mushrooms before? I write and I haven't either. No, you don't throw up on mushrooms. Some people get it wrong. Mixing it with garlic and tomato sauce. A little fussy. Yeah, it's like a, ain't not, no, it's not shithead Bella right now yet. Dope ass. You've only done, you've done the accidental eating of the pot. A little bit of smoking and you know everybody in the 80s I never did it, man. I've avoided it. Avoided it. Really never know what you're missing, Joe. I had a buddy. You feel good and you get really angry for the next three days.

Speaker 1:          02:14:39       Horrible. Not Interested. I had a buddy who's a cousin, was a dealer and I watched his, his life erode and a, this is when I was like, I guess I was like 1516 I watched this guy, he was a few years older than us. He had graduated from high school and just fell apart and it just got real skinny as hide. Haydn, his fucking, they had an attic apartment. They lived in his parent's attic or something like that and they would just do coke and watch TV. It was a mess. She wasn't doing it right. Well you have to be in a dance club with a bunch of horse. I think he was doing it because he had a lot of it because he was selling it, you know, so he in it all the time and so I got to see this guy just fucking erode, you know?

Speaker 1:          02:15:19       Yeah. You didn't miss nothing that you feel good for like 15 minutes. It's you fork. And then especially with my type of personality, like the crash, right? Oh I'm just depressed and not interested. I never got the crash. I never that I never got the bad part of it cause that's cheery guy. No, he's there all the time. He lives in the crash. Exactly. Chicks love it so much. That's the best part. Like I used to just carry it around and pull it out. If I saw a hot girl and immediately you're in into her house, you know like yeah, they really did so crazy cause they didn't get all sloppy. Like when they get drunk and oh remember our friends back in the day, they would just like put it on that account. I have a friend who used to get it just because he knew girls wanted it.

Speaker 1:          02:16:04       This is the best way to get laid out like a trout. He would only do it if they wanted to do it. You're like, all right, I don't do it with your shit. Fucking hated it, you know. But he would do it because it was the best way to get laid. He's like, if you don't have coke, and I got in late and I was like, really? That's so crazy. But when you got it got damn. I would watch girls run after him just run because they knew he had coke cause it was like that term coke whore. There's no, there's no coke studs. You know there's no guys so good pint bang in fat chicks because they got a barrel of coke, their house. It's so true. I bet you feminist would say that too. It's not fair. We are whores when we do it.

Speaker 1:          02:16:38       You guys are dealers. Right? But it is true, right? Like why does it is coke whore is a very legitimate expression like or whatever coke, promiscuous gow call it. Let's stop. Call them cohorts. Let's try, let's try to be kind here. Coke, promiscuous female, you know, but it's not like a coke man, you know. Weird, right? That's true. That's true. Well kills dudes. Dick's right? It doesn't kill your Dick. No, but I watch killed your deck. No, he always says it kills his deck. I know. I've never had a problem with that ever Dick. Yeah. I got Trussell Dick Trussell deck. So how's that photo? The guy on stage? Yeah. You want to show that photo in the show? Yeah. That, let's pull that photo up. Jamie. We were at the Mirage this weekend, uh, doing stand up and a Duncan was onstage and Killen I guess he was loving it so much is dick got hard.

Speaker 1:          02:17:30       So he's got the pants on tight jeans and he's uh, he's uh, got a little woody and it's so crazy because it's so big. You noticed it. Did you notice it that night when he was onstage while I was on the side and I didn't see it. But look at that. That's does that, I don't know. It's very calming. It's in the middle of that photo. Got It. Perfect. Like he's almost pointing it out. It's like he's like amazing. Someone sucking his dick and I looked like a magician making it rise. Right. Ah, he has so much to Aaron Liba water. Rodarius cauterize, cauterize don't exist anymore. Does anybody by quarter isn't one apparently. Can you even buy corduroys those are like Tan genes. But yeah, there was another, there was a lot of fun times, man. They were doing Ari and Dunkin kissed, which was one of the best things I've ever seen.

Speaker 1:          02:18:30       Pulled it off for me. My Instagram. Yeah. Yeah. They kissed, uh, when they knew that the camera's going to be on them, they in Dunkin kissed like when they knew the camera was going to be there while the fights are going on because they were sitting in the front row right behind, I dunno. And already had it in him. They had done it until Brian sends me a text message with a photo of the two of them kissing while I'm doing commentary. My phone buzzes. I check it, and I see the fucking picture and I turned to look at them and I held up the picture. And thank God it was in between fights because it was like, you know, a big promo thing, you know, fucking Conor Mcgregor, they're doing all this shit and I'm fucking crying, laughing. I mean, tears are rolling down my eyes. Watch this. Watch this. Watch. Look to the left. There's Ari Fleischer is ducking. There's more time. That is, it's

Speaker 7:          02:19:28       so funny. Dot Com forward slash the Joe Rogan experience. Oh yeah, that's that. W The guy next to you is I dust dusty. He's laughing his ass. Oh, frosty. Frosty. He's our sound guy. Looked disgusted. And one of them was laughing and they also did a funny Illuminati. Oh yeah. It's not

Speaker 1:          02:19:57       Joe Rogan experience. It's instagram.com forward slash Joe Rogan experience. Just that. Yeah, but it's up there. Fuck and Hilarious, man. Those guys are so funny. They're so silly. They have such, they were on mushrooms too, by the way. Oh, there are mushrooms all weekend. They brought Ari brought allegedly not true. I'm making this up. If anybody's about about belt, he brought to Shataki is about nine grams. Saki and they were splitting them and we were up til like five o'clock in the morning. I couldn't do it. I can't. I can't do mushrooms and then watch people fight. Right. I might pack up my shit and go home. I might be like, I can't do this anymore. I called up the UFC. Listen, I'm call Kenny Florian. It's over. I'm going to presale. Yeah, I'm going to go to the jungle one with my inner soul. I was in Montreal with Arie and this summer at the festival and him and Metzger.

Speaker 1:          02:20:49       I never saw so much. Wah. I didn't, they weren't straight. Perfectly. One minute. No. All Week. He enjoys that weed. Oh, Mike makes him happy. Especially now that he's doing really well. Art is a happy motherfucker right now. He said he's having so much fun. His life is fantastic right now. He's doing so well because our evening nut fucking guy, he worked hard. He worked hard for a long time, but his comedy is so God damn good right now and it's good because of hard work. It's beautiful to see man. I love watching the guy just really like pull it all together and fucking, I mean just through sheer, I've known [inaudible] since he was an open miker you know, I became friends with them when he was working at the door at the comedy store and through sheer will and hard work. He's a great comic now.

Speaker 1:          02:21:30       I fucking love that. I'd love Shit. I love seeing that happen. He's a fun dude. I was watching him at the, at the festival, him and yeah, him and Metzker. Hopefully they would tweet and before the festival about joking about working with me and they had making giant Depa will probably smoke enough a DePaul. I'm like, well I didn't even really know anything about these two guys. I know they're funny cats, but I didn't know how much weight. I'm like, what are all these? We'd jokes tweeting about weed and me being like a straight guy, oh the fuck they think they are. And then I get up to the festival man. And they were just the whole time. Well you gotta be careful to in Montreal because it's not legal. It's not right. No. And you get busted with weed and then you know, they deport you. You're fucked. Ceville because right now my festival, but you can't come back either. I mean they'll, you know, if you get caught with drugs, like in some parts of Canada, it's pretty much legal in Toronto and it's pretty to legal in Vancouver.

Speaker 5:          02:22:26       I was gonna say makeover. Yeah. BC though. I mean, I was in a documentary called the union that was based on the economy of a, it would the, the documenters based on how much marijuana is involved in the economy of British Columbia. And it's fucking everything. It's, uh, if they, if they pulled wheat out, if we didn't exist, British Columbia would be fucked. Like so much of the money that flows, oh, is that a reddish come involved with marijuana? Huge part of it. And this is a documentary by my friend Adam Score, GE who just did a recent one called the culture high that Brian was into and um, it's, he's just got these great documentaries that show like first of all the hypocrisy involved and making weed illegal. Why alcohol is legal, whether you smoke weed or not, it's fucking stupid and they just highlight how stupid it is.

Speaker 5:          02:23:14       But it just shows you like how so British Columbia, it's pretty pretty close to legal but Montreal not so much. I'm not sure. I was a little more tricky and it's scary to a lot of people in a lot of people do is keep like old joints in there. Ash Trays in their cars and things like that. You could get pulled over and get a Dui and then not be allowed to go back into Canada because they want to let you have DUIs. I saw my my car the other day and I had to like a joint sitting my back seat and I'm like, dude, I need to be not be the sloppy because I would forget about the Dui aspect that they can get you a Dui, but just being stoned and driving, well not only that, they're trying to crack down on that more because look, the whole deal with Duis, there's two things going on.

Speaker 5:          02:23:53       One, they're trying to keep people from driving and smashing into people. When people die and put two, they got to make collars. They're trying to make arrests. They get, they have fucking like, they have a schedule that they had to have to adhere to their quotas. Quotas, which should be illegal because like what the fuck would they do if everybody decided we won't break any laws for a year? No one breaks a law for a year. What would they do with able to sway off all the cops or would they treat him like firemen where they just sit back and wait for something to happen? You know, nobody arrests. Nobody says, Hey, it hasn't been a fire in six months. How about we cut back on the firemen? Fuck you. You know, we know what it's like when there's a fire. Keep the fucking firemen asshole. But if there was no laws being broken and the money wasn't coming in from the cops to justify spending the money, you know, on salaries and all that jazz, I wonder what they would do.

Speaker 5:          02:24:40       We reach a point in our culture where everyone's doing mushrooms all the time and no one to the crimes, no cops. We hear what they're doing now in New York City, cops are saying that they're not going to arrest anybody unless it's absolutely necessary, which is like, Whoa, what the fuck does that mean? You were arresting people when it wasn't necessary. Isn't that a part of the God damn problem? I mean there's sort of admitting that everybody was right in that, that when they arrested that Eric Gardner guy like this is fucking arrested some guy for selling and selling loose cigarettes. Like isn't there someone selling crack somewhere? Is there someone beaten babies? Yeah. But the city Yag meant there is, that's how tax hungry fucking de Blasio and the leftists are that they go after they, they suggest that they, that the cops enforce those laws. So because it, because the taxes, they were losing so much money

Speaker 1:          02:25:24       with illegal cigarettes. Really? Yeah. Cause they tax crazy in New York City. How much money could lot eagle cigarettes a lot. Yes. Yes. So stupid. But that's how obsessed yeah. With fucking tag, you know, in this room to know that it's a left wing thing that the left wing police or the mayor is responsible for what we would think of as a right wing act of arresting someone. That's kind of fun. Right? Yeah. Because like left wing, like left leftist ideology would be that, you know, these are racist cops that are doing it, but maybe it's the fucking, it really is a tax issue. Right. It's forcing these guys to do, a lot of people say that and now the cops hate them. They're alternative back on him on the flight deck. I just, I know nothing about him. Well, he's just a fucking knew all.

Speaker 1:          02:26:09       He went to fucking Cuba on his honeymoon. That's all I need to know. He did. And he helped the east as he's a fucking mark. Just cock sucker. He went, he went back in the day. Yeah. Really. Holy Shit. He's, he's his fire fucking left as they come and what she's, whatever. But, but hey, New York voted for him. Whatever you get with your, you know, you get what? Yeah. Do York is very left though. She's really left. Yeah. Well it's the two coasts. It's here and you know, and, and I mean, Chicago is liberal, but not like that. Not like putting New York is also aggressive. It's a very strange place. It's like there's aggressive, there's progressive and aggressive. There's like, you got your extreme left like Williamsburg and you know, all these, these Brooklyn people that are like, you know, everything is like super left. But then you also have like some, I saw more racism when I lived in New York than any other places I lived.

Speaker 1:          02:26:59       Ever. The word Negra just came flying out of people's mouths like it would, they had racial Tourette's. Like I, when I lived in Boston I didn't hear nearly as much racism. Where were you hearing that? New York, a pool halls, uh, boxing gyms, martial arts places, all those stupid places I was hanging out in it. Maybe it was the wrong hanging out with the wrong people, but I just heard a lot of racism. I know a lot of road gigs. I would hear racism and a lot of road gigs. It just seemed more accepted in New York then. It wasn't Boston. What do you think Boston's more racist? No, I don't know. I just, I don't hear the word anywhere. Come out of white people ever. This kid to say it around you. That's what it is. Except the bedroom.

Speaker 1:          02:27:41       I bet him in the car. I felt like when someone cuts you off, it comes out of your own mouth. But it seems like there's a weird thing going on right now in New York where they're trying to like fucking fine, comfortable, happy place, you know? Yeah. Well, yeah, the mayor, whatever. Well, the stock when it gets too political, stop and search all that. Stop and Frisk, Sinead, all that. An issue with he, while he was campaigning to become mayor, he painted the cops as bad guys and then coming out and saying, well, I have a son who was black and I had to sit them down. So you have to be careful around caught. That's a fucking slap in the face to cops. You're going to tell me a cop, a fuck. Specially a white guy that goes into the projects every night and rest his fucking life to protect people from other black people.

Speaker 1:          02:28:22       He's racist. Mm. Come on. Oh fucking, well not obviously this bad cops. So you know, it's not good. Every group has shitty people in it and this guy painted them, uh, you know, as the bad guys. And then you get Sharpton involved. Who's a fucking scumbag? I don't care what anybody says. I mean, you sit him next to the police commissioner on, on, you know, he's a meeting you have, he's thin, he's a race panel. So he makes his living and he said was also a charlatan. I mean the, the idea that that guy is expected at all. You see him on CNN and the White House 80 times the last fucking it's for the year. I mean that the black community had Martin Luther King who's like universally praised and a great leader and now they have al Sharpton. Martin looked at Kingwood. Well you can't have Jesse Jackson the more you notice that Jesse Jackson's a fucking pariah.

Speaker 1:          02:29:05       You know why? Cause he got busted but scamming all these fucking companies out of 10. That's what she does. Exactly. It was under and all. That's what he does. He shakes down, come Pepsi, it goes to Pepsi and so you don't have enough pig black people. We're gonna, we're gonna pick it. And then they send money to his action committees. Coalition. Yeah. National Action Network and, but you don't hear about Jesse Jackson anymore. And then his son got busted. I remember Jesse Jackson jail, right? Yeah. He had mental problems. His son like mentally ill. He was on medication and stuff. Yeah. It's just sad that the black community doesn't have like a, a real powerful, respected civil rights leader today. You know you're Al Sharpton will always be defined by that. Tawana Brawley, I mean you can just fucking quote pic. You could quote mine a million fucking things that he said that a ridiculous, you know about how black people can be racist.

Speaker 1:          02:29:55       It's only white people that can be racist like stupid shit like that. Like come on man. Everybody can be racing on. Exactly. Chinese people can be racist. Well fucking Peruvians could be really what, what are you talking about? Like racism is not specific to like one different nationality. It's, it's the whole thing about being a cop in my opinion is that being a cop is almost a job that no one can do. It's to have that kind of power and a gun and then to see violence and crime and people lying to you every day at their worst. You see people at their worst every day. Yeah. And now and when you do all the, all the statistics and how many times cops interact it literally they do their job right. 99.9% of the time. I mean it of course is bad ones here and there.

Speaker 1:          02:30:42       This whole 9% and they're interacting with a thousand people a day. You know, every 12 million a year, you're getting a lot of fucking bad interactions and that was the ones that make the paper. Absolutely. It's just the job that's like almost impossible for a person. It's thankless. That's why they should be treated with respect, in my opinion. Yeah, and it's not only just tankless, it's also like the fucking stress, the PTSD. Those guys must be under, they commit suicide at an unbelievable rate. Unbelievable rate. Petty's Oh cups, Buckeye and soldiers. Very similar in that way. They both have very high rates of suicide and they both see ridiculous amounts of shit. It's just almost like, seems like

Speaker 5:          02:31:20       there should be a better way, but I don't see about her way. I mean, I mean, I don't see how you could live in a world that doesn't have cops. I mean, there's people that think that, oh, we should live in, I'm an anarchist. Hilarious. To me, someone who's never been in a way that's worked, they must've never met an asshole, you know? You never know. It's just, well, they're in denial. Then it, yeah. Well it's also like a cute thing to say. It puts you in like a very progressive camp and of of of you know, a very high level thinkers, elite leftist thinkers. You know, I'm an anarchist and I believe that we should all be free. Yeah, there should be no laws and let the market decide what the fuck out of it. That all sounds good in theory, but then when the rubber hits the road it all falls apart.

Speaker 5:          02:32:03       That's how the Mongols came about. If there was another, if you can point to another system of government that works better than that, so I'll be glad to fucking open my ears. How about a system of government that works at all? It seems like we have, when people get together as a large amount of people, you're just gonna always going to have a certain amount of chaos, certain amount of crime, certain amount of people doing shit. They shouldn't be doing a certain amount of fucking victimization and even look at the fucking shit that's going on right now where we find out about bill Cosby, a guy with money, a guy with fame, a guy with everyone loves. He still doing creepy, shitty things. Like you have to have a certain amount of law. You have to because even a guy like that is doing fucked up shit.

Speaker 5:          02:32:45       It's right. Well it's about humanity with yeah. And you know, that's why we all have to do mushrooms and DMT. Nick. Well Dude, I listening to you that night. I was ready to go find some, but uh, all the stores are plus, it's very difficult to find in a store. You gotta go to the back. It's like buying Cuban cigars. He got to know a guy. Are we going to be able to get Cuban cigars now? How's that work? Yes. Supposedly. When is that going to only plus to this thing. I got a, almost got in trouble taking some back. I at the last minute, I didn't take some back from Montreal and then the fucking guy at the airport literally asked me, you got any cigars in there? I go, what? Like I must have smelled like a fucking cigar or something. I don't know what happened.

Speaker 5:          02:33:29       I go, what? And he goes, did you bring back any Q? I'm just asking you because they are illegal. I go, no, I definitely did not bring back anything. And they opened up my bag and they looked at, there was nothing in there, but I was like, oh shit. Like this is real. Like they actually bused people. You go to jail for having a fucking cigar. It's a taste. Any different for real. I know one of those things, right? One of those fucking things like having an alligator on your shirt, right? You know like these are Cubans, long law. I don't know man. Kevin James and I used to smoke a lot of cigars together and he didn't like Cubans. He's like, they're too fucking strong. They'll knock you on your ass. Like there's certain Cuban, like a punch. Like that's one of them. And there's a few, a Hoyle de Monterrey double corona and he's big fucking fat. Stogies they'll knock your Darryl and how the dirt, they make you high. You know, I used to

Speaker 2:          02:34:17       chew tobacco on college. Did you have the, like the depth or the everything? We had the depth that we had the Levi Garrett leaves. That's the real shit. That was the, those girls up there chewing. No, I'm at the library one night. I looked behind me. He's a cute girl spitting into a cup, but a, yeah, Levi Garrett. The, the, the leaves and uh, that's the real shit. Oh my God, it's bags. Yes. I'd never done that until I get up there. And uh, but then now I stopped doing that. And when I got out of college at my buddy's house, he had some skull, so I put a pinch of, put a pinch in and I turned white. It felt like I was sea sick. I got all sweaty and shit. It's like when you young, you can handle that, all this stuff. Well, I just was like, what the fuck I'm going to Puke when I was a kid.

Speaker 2:          02:35:01       I was probably like 12 or 13 I was really into Tom Sawyer and huckleberry Finn and I wanted to try chewing tobacco cause Tom Sawyer and huckleberry Finn, those moms. So I kind of like a, it was like a square, like a little Brownie of chewing tobacco and you break a piece off and put in your mouth fucking 12 oh I don't know how I got it. First of all, why someone's selling me chewing tobacco because I was, I guess it was legal to get where I'm like, I don't know how the fuck I got. I don't know how I got it. Like now that I'm thinking about it, but I remember chewing it and fucking puking my brains out. The saliva build up in my mouth. I was like, no. Yeah I did that toe. I can taste it. I, you know how like for a long time I couldn't drink Jack Daniels cause when sick on it, yeah, we got sick on it and know it.

Speaker 2:          02:35:48       I would smell it and I would get sick just smelling it, but that I could taste that chewing tobacco right now if I think about it and almost throw up cherry skull aspe how about those little packets? Like a tea bag? Yeah. That's pretty bad. Well don't those give you like massive mouth cancer though? Yeah. They all do a video. That guy or that guy who got his John removed like you would go to like do these public service announcements that uh, schools where kids would be snuff. He was like, no, fuck up some square jawed captain America looking motherfucker. And then all of a sudden he's got like no champion. Like, Oh half his tongue was removed. Half my time when I'm with curing tobacco, you're wiling to look like a baseball. Probably not cool. Everything's numb to him. Food tastes like shit. Can't whistle, tastes like shit.

Speaker 2:          02:36:42       It falls out of his holding his side, sloppy side of his face. What's crazy is that they would advertise not only candy cigarettes to kids, but also big league chew, which is like the chewing gum. That kind of, it's the reason why I started it. Yeah. He's like, Oh yeah, like the baseball players. Remember big league chew. This is the real stuff. It's gum, right? Shaving Gum shavings. That's pretty evil. A lot of places they made those a little candy cigarettes illegal though, didn't it? Yeah. I don't think he could buy me where Kenya wearing their leggings. Weird. It's weird. He's like the cigarette in

Speaker 1:          02:37:16       a fake gun. If the fucking candy people were involved in the tobacco industry, then it would make sense like you know, and then you would go ahead. I'll be where if there's a direct correlation. That was the most fucked up police brutality thing was that 12 year old kid that got shot with having a fake gun and Cleveland, you know that one. They shot him on in two seconds of seeing him. They got out of the car and just started on, don't drop the God didn't say anything. Just started fucking crank, crank, crank, crank. He didn't point it at him. I don't know what the fuck happened. I don't know. I wasn't there because you have a split second. We hit silver. We did a thing on the Chris rock show. We did a sketch about that. I was playing a cop every, I mean every, every sketch.

Speaker 1:          02:37:58       But that was one of the things, cause there was a shooting back then and that was the sketch because somebody recently get shot. The guy had a banana, literally had a banana. I was reading this in the paper and I freaked out cause we did a sketch and Chris rock where we were cops and they will holding up pictures. What, what's this? And it was a banana. That was the whole geno and we'd go, it's a gun picture of a bike. It's a gun. It was really, it was really funny. But then I read it because he gave some guy literally had like a banana or wrapped in tin foil or something. But you're a cop on the, you have two seconds to make up your mind. I mean what are you going to go? Oh you get shot. That's true. That is true. And they're not driving by spraying of 12 year old.

Speaker 1:          02:38:33       But then I did, it was, he got released from another police force for being like mental oval stable. He's already trained and they hired him and this other police force, there's a bunch of issues. My friend Justin was a real gun nut, told me the whole story behind it. Like he's a his right wing as he get and he told me the whole story behind. He's like, that guy was fucked up. Like that guy should not have been a copy. So, but they make, you know, there's a certain amount of money involved in training one of those guys and once that money's invested, you'll, they'll hire someone in another district because of the fact they've already been trained and you know, you don't have to retrain anybody and spend those resources. Yeah. Too many second chances. When you were working for, uh, for Chris Rock, I'm like, did you work when you were developed?

Speaker 1:          02:39:11       Was he developing his specials? We weren't. We would, we weren't involved in that. We were doing should in the show he had his HBO show. Right. We're coming up at such desired certain guys though to work with a specialist. Right. Like I know he um, Jenny helped to them and well, well with like the Oscars, he hired us, Richard, Jenny May and, and punching up a couple of movies and this is what it's watch came from. He sent us up, ma'am. Actually Tina Fey was there. Louie, we met at a hotel for a day and just like punched up a script. Tina Fey writes a lot. Does she doesn't do something before she was famous right before she got real famous. Should do stand up. That's a good question. I don't know. I don't think so. I don't think so. Probably second city and all that. But she was funny and was writing at SNL at the time.

Speaker 1:          02:40:00       So, but uh, yeah, we went to some hotel for the data, punch up a script and I remember Tina Louie and whatever. But, but like I bought about a month later, we all get these Rolexes. Yeah. And it's inscribed in the back. It says for you help motherfucker is what it says on the back. Well that's cool. That's, that was the most fun I ever had my life. We're going to dead show. Oh my God. He was so laid back and just, he'd come in, it would be an 80 degree day. He go, fuck it. Let's go to the Yankees game. Oh, that's cool. And then, then a big momma's house came out of what I, one of those, remember big moment or Martin Lawrence. Martin Lawrence in the second one came out and he, I think Chris [inaudible] himself and then he made us all go see it because it was so bad.

Speaker 8:          02:40:40       He made us all go to the movie. We all sat down, we all had tickets. And then

Speaker 1:          02:40:44       20 minutes in this scene, somebody, him sitting on the toilet making shit jokes and then Chris goes, okay, let's call it the tall one.

Speaker 8:          02:40:50       Good to see. That's all they wanted you to see. We all walked out. That's all he wanted to see. I mean, because

Speaker 1:          02:41:00       it was that bad. Yeah. We were all laughing our ass off. But how bad it was. Yeah. I mean it was shit, but it was what it was. What I expected from a big momma's house or whatever the fuck you know. I mean I love Martin Lawrence, the comedy store. I met him out here. Dave Chappelle had a really fucking good point about what is it about black men in Hollywood? They reach a certain amount of fame and they make you dress up like a woman. Like that is true. It's fucking Eddie Murphy did it. Jamie Foxx did it. Marzi science conspiracy. I'm sure he was. But I mean it is kind of funny. I mean how many white guys dress up like a woman? You got Robin Williams who did a Fuckin Hoffman, Mrs Doubtfire, Dustin Hoffman, tootsie. Um, does it bosom buddies. That's Tom Hanks. But they weren't famous that they became famous from doing that.

Speaker 1:          02:41:53       And that was sort of a premise of the show. They had a rent controlled place that would only allow chicks or something like that. Um, what was the one that uh, you know who Patrick Swayze. That's right. And again, that was a fucking homeboy was in that too. I'm Wesley Snipes. Well, how about this? He was in there too, too long food day to Julie Newmar. What was the uh, Dallas Player's club? Bababa Jerry Lego. Jared Leto. Yeah, but he was playing a transgender, he was playing like a gay brand. No, I'm just listening chair front. He's not playing a woman. An actual woman like Mama's house like that. He was playing a woman like, it wasn't like he was wearing a woman's, not the fucking conspiracy theory. The white Hollywood guys make it black guys present. But Ralph Harris, remember Ralph Harris? He had a TV show where he dressed up like a woman.

Speaker 1:          02:42:40       No Brown. Ralph Harris had like a TV show. I remember Ralph Harris. Funny, funny. He had a TV show where he dressed up like a woman like on the show. Robin Hair? No, Ralph. Ralph Harris. Robin Harris was the funny guy. I'm thinking of Robin. Robin Harris is very far my, he was like great Robin. Well he was fucking funny. He was like the king of uh, black la comedy for a long first time I saw him. He caught it comes out, I think it was like a def comedy jam things up and heat, but he had just a wife beater on with a big gut hanging out and I was crying at how funny

Speaker 2:          02:43:12       the material was just but just working class. I mean, oh my God. He didn't give a fuck. I don't know if he ever really got really famous. He was about to, he was on the verge. He had this one joke that fucking killed me and he goes, I don't ever mess with no pretty women. Pretty women was too much work. I don't like me an ugly girl. I tell other girl, bitch, I'm going to the moon. Oh, you be careful up there. I don't want nothing bad to happen to you. He didn't make his eyes big when you'd say it. Oh, you be careful up there. You have to say it, man. He was funny. He was a funny dude. Bad. He was a funny dude. This is a three hour show. Yeah, it's over. It's over. We did. You always do. All the time.

Speaker 2:          02:43:58       Once you start talking, look, how easy was it? You just did it to no, I know that's hard to do. No, I know. I mean it's nice and have a studio on cameras. I'm, I'm, I'm hunt. I'm hunched over a card table in the fucking red sox hat on my basement. Where you all of a sudden, Holy Shit. Did you see that you ran out of gas? Three hours at the coffee. I was like the fucking base porn tomorrow I'll be up until for three days now. Will you warm when you do your podcast, do you do, is it audio only or do you have a camera on you? I've only be done it like a little over a year. How many episodes do you do it? Once a week or once a week? I'm like 63 episodes in and I love it. I, I just, cause I like radio.

Speaker 2:          02:44:32       I love radio. It's what it, it's one of my favorite things is almost as much as stand up. So, but I don't have guests because I live way up in the woods. Nobody's coming up. So you just do it. You stop talking for an hour. I treat it like a radio, you know, I do new stuff. I treat it kind of almost like a radio show. Like bill bird does his stuff all by himself too. Yeah. He rambles. Rarely has a person on, yeah. Yeah. He'll tell you read like a viewer email or listener emails and stuff like that, but I just, I'll do stuff in the nose and despite my personal life and just ramble. It's a good, it's like a good exercise for radio. Oh yeah. To meet, keep it moving forward. Try to keep them at the Tei and I like to play with sound effects and shit.

Speaker 2:          02:45:09       I'm just like a kid. Like a iPad or something. Yeah. Yeah. I have run it through my iPad. Two bits of glass. Try that for like one episode. I was like, well you don't have to look at you. She's like, I feel like I'm at CBS studios. Right.
