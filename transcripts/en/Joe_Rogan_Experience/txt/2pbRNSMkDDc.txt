Speaker 1:          00:00:01       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:00:01       Dave Smith, president of the Kanye West Fan club is here. Comic Dave Smith on twitter, tweeting pictures of your Dick. He loves them. I love Kanye and Dick Pics. I'm glad we got that APP was Hirsi Dude, thanks for doing this because I loved you on Ari's podcast man. You were fucking awesome on it. It was really cool. It was very, it was a welcome surprise, you know, not that already. He's a podcast is not always awesome. It's always awesome. But it was like, damn, this dude needs a lot of political shit. And you knew about the Hillary Clinton thing with the a rape trial that she was involved in defending the guy looks. Paul explain it because it's, it's a fucked up story and I want to get it wrong.

Speaker 1:          00:00:42       Okay, so Hilary Clinton, this is way back when she was a criminal defense attorney. She got a a child rapist off and a real bad one. It wasn't one of those good child rapists.

Speaker 2:          00:00:53       It was a real way. But it was like jared bang and 15 year olds who was making sandwiches, you know, gives you a picture pickles, you suck his dick. But even like, you know, you heard like the, the way Michael Jackson was accused of raping, boy, that was like the nicest way you could rape a kid. It was like take him to an amusement park. Yeah. Talk and I show him the Lama and the Monkey. All right. Child rape is bad. Let me start with that. Horrible. The worst thing ever. Kanye, Dick Pics. Good, bad. Just want to be clear on where I stand.

Speaker 1:          00:01:28       Uh, but so sheet, so this guy, uh, um, basically raped a 12 year old girl and really brutal the details of the story and she defended the guy and there's a, there's tape of her in an interview talking about this years later now. It's still, it's back in the day. It's when Hillary Clinton's doing like a southern accent. There's been like six different Hillary Clinton's that have existed. This was the southern wife of Bill Clinton. Hillary when she was, when he was the mayor or governor of Arkansas. So was that early eighties? Yeah, somewhere around that, around that time period. I'm not sure. I'm not sure precisely where the tape is from. Um, but she is, I mean it's, it's, there's, there's a lot of videos I could point to online that's, I think, strong evidence that Hillary Clinton is a sociopath. Um, I'm personally convinced of that. Now I'm not a professional and I can't diagnose her, but this video is really up to, I mean, she's laughing about the details of the rape case and how she got the guy off and she laughs about how funny it is when, when she basically admits that she knew the guy was guilty because she's going like, oh, we convinced the jury it was a big miscarriage of justice and she's, she says that he took a polygraph and, and passed it.

Speaker 1:          00:02:41       And then she says that forever destroyed my belief in polygraphs. So she's basically saying, I know this guy raped this, this little girl. But we were able to get them off and she laughs about having the, the bloody underwear as the big piece of evidence. I mean, it's really, really intense. Intense, awful shit. And what's really

Speaker 2:          00:02:59       crazy about it is that in this world of like, you know, rape culture and Social Justice Warrior liberal outrage there is just deafening silence when it comes to the Clintons. Do you think it's a lack of information? Because most people don't go looking for this stuff for stuff like what you're talking about. Most people have to find it on Fox News and go, what? Outrageous. They don't go looking for it. Cause there's a lot you'd have to look through. I mean you'd have to go through all the Whitewater stuff, you'd have to go through all that Vince foster stuff. You'd have to try to find, and there's a lot of like weird stuff about them in their past that you'd have to sort through. How much of this is legit, how much has it, most people aren't going to do that. And so it's, it's not being discussed and you'll have to filter out like that just nonsense.

Speaker 2:          00:03:40       Cause that's, that's the problem with where we're at now is that the truth is out in the Internet, but it's sandwiched in between a whole bunch of nonsense. And so you've got to like get that out of the way. And the conspiracy theorists would say that nonsense is there on purpose. Yes, that's right. Because everybody, every conspiracy theorist, as it turns out, when I read more conspiracy theorist, it turns out they were just working for the conspiracy and they're against like Alex Jones. They all think now is working to tryst me. Alison is my friend. He's just crazy. There's no CIA involved there. Well, that's a fun thing when you get into stuff that people think is a conspiracy and then you're like, oh no, no, no. It's just a crazy guy. Well, I've heard conspiracies that involve me and so when I hear that I go, oh, I see how you, I've, I've read some shit about me being a CIA agent.

Speaker 2:          00:04:24       Like, yeah, what a circuitous route I took. I went from kickboxing to standup comedy. All the while, secretly undercover for the CIA are going to plant them in news radio. And before you know it, he'll be leading public opinion. Dude, here's how even funnier one I have Eddie Bravo thinks that it's perhaps possible perhaps that Laurel Canyon was all about a CIA psyops and Jim Morrison and all these music music musical in the middle of saying musicians musical, powerful La Pot, that they were all a part of some CIA plan to, uh, to like the institute, the drug movement. Like I don't even understand the plan, but the idea is that all these influential people came out of the, this Laurel Canyon area and Jim Morrison's dad was in the CIA and light take is like Jesus Christ. Do you know how much fucking, how busy CIA dads are? They're never around for their kid.

Speaker 2:          00:05:17       Of course, the kid grows up to be Jim Morrison. It's not that like the dad was there influencing him with a fucking hypnosis, one of those watches. You are going to be the voice of a generation, right? It's not no one engineer or something like that. All things being equal, it's best to look at the, the most simple answer. Right, but outcomes razor. Right, exactly. Uh, I do think like, I feel like with a lot of those conspiracy theorists like my take on it is like you, you have like the government who, it's almost like if the government was a person, you could be like, okay, we've got them on murdering these 50 people and we have it cold hard. They clearly did it and then you're like, yeah, but I heard a rumor that they also murdered another people. I'm like,

Speaker 1:          00:05:58       can we just focus on what we know? They do it right. Like we're slaughtering people in the Middle East. We don't need a makeup. All this other nonsense just to make it more sellable. Well, it's this, this idea that we're being controlled. That's the one that's the, that's the overlying theme I guess, or the over. It's, it's, if you look at like all of the conspiracies, whether their chem trails or whether it's all about like engineering, like global warming. It's like Geo Engineering. There's all this, it's all about engineering friends. It's all about people that are worried about eugenics. They want, like Alex Jones says they want to kill five. They want to leave 500 million people worldwide or something like that, like this fucking number. I was like, Whoa, Whoa, Whoa, whoa. I think going to be a mortal like did they know what the fuck they're doing? Like you, you really, you really think that this is a plan.

Speaker 1:          00:06:49       Kill everyone except half a million. Look, I do think there's some really shady plans that are up there at the top. I think what they get wrong sometimes is they think that, um, that everything that's happening was actually controlled from the top. I think there's plans that people in it like to build a bear group is real. That exists and I think they do want to control the world, but I think more often than not, they have like 10 things they want to do. Some of them work out, some of them don't. Then they roll with the punches on that. Then they try to change things from there. It's not as perfect as like everything they did worked out perfectly and was, but you know, it's a little easier. It's more, it's more of a fun story. If they're just an ultimate control, well then the have that number, the 500 million number, like why is, how do you know that number?

Speaker 1:          00:07:37       It's specific. This is what I heard. 500 million. Oh Wow. Wonder if I'd make the cut, but it still thinking about all the billions of people and it could. 500 million's not that much. If you think about 7 billion, but they're probably going to come off Indians and Oliver's, you start to think whether you could make the cut and my top 500 million, if they're going to leave 500 million people and the planet, this room, there's some wiggle room. They're like, okay, you're going to need like 60 comedians. Did you want to get in though? I mean, what are they going to do with all those bodies? What are I going to do at six and a half billion of bodies? How bad is the earth going to smell for like a month? Right? Yeah. That's a good point too. It's a very good point. I have these guys thought this through.

Speaker 1:          00:08:13       I don't think there's hot the wall and not only that, but what did you kill the wrong people? What if the people that you kill, we're going to figure out a way to cure cancer or get us to Mars or you don't. You just can't. But that's why that whole, that's why believing, which is a much more common belief out of the conspiracy thing, but believing that populations a problem is, is crazy because like you said, you never know when that you know, they, they'll like uh, environmentalist. There'll be like, well, if we have too many people and there's two big carbon footprint, if you're like, yeah, except until we have the one person who figures out how to save all of us. Right. And then that got, you know, you need a bunch of people to get that. You don't get that in a village with log cabins.

Speaker 1:          00:08:47       That's right. They don't figure out how to fix the world. They just don't heed millions of people that need to live in cities. Food needs to be delivered to them. They need to be safe and then they can up with ideas. This thing is a game of numbers. You to have mad, mad numbers man. We got to throw a lot. Oh, I did want to address what you asked before. La Pod is powerful. Powerful what you said before when you're talking about this stuff with the Clinton uh, tape and you said, why, uh, why is it that people are, they need to find the information. I think there is some of that, right? Because say if they made this a story on the news, like if every day they were playing, they had, it's amazing the power that media has to choose what story we're going to make the story and what story will maybe get mentioned here and then fallen, you know, Fade into obscurity so they could, the media could make that a story that everyone has to deal with.

Speaker 1:          00:09:36       But I've found there's a lot of denial. Like when I talk to liberals or, or Hillary supporters and I'll bring that stuff up and there's a lot of like, yeah, well whatever. Exactly. Well whatever. But the same people who are like, we live in a rape culture and we'll go after like tosh for making a joke in bad taste. And then you're like, well here's this woman laughing about getting a child rapist off. Forget some abstract contributing to rape culture, contributing to rape culture, getting a rapist who would've gone to jail back out into the streets and they'll, so it's like, to me a mix of the media doesn't do their job and then people are also kind of in denial. Well people are intensely tribal, intensely tribal and their support for brands, you know, forget about political parties, political parties, oftentimes the most tribal, I mean I follow people that all they do is mock liberals online and then I fall.

Speaker 1:          00:10:29       Other people we're, all they do is mock conservatives and God they're so similar or the same fucking people. There's atheism and then there's these people that are super religious. There's all this God Christian stuff on the right. And then on the left it's like atheism is their God. And I don't mean it in there, God is like, it's, it's an actual religion. Their fault. I mean you almost kind of have to be in that group to be on that side. It's this weird thing that's going on where you've got people that are subscribing to atheism. Nothing wrong with atheism. It's not what I'm saying. I'm just saying God is, it's so universal on the left that it seems to me to be a trait that you attribute with this tribe. Like almost like you have to accept this trait. Right? And then I think, and I guess that's maybe a criticism I have of a like Sam Harris and that's about, I know you had him on your show recently, but I think a lot of those guys who got themselves in this camp of we're the atheists or the ones committed to rational thought and religion is terrible.

Speaker 1:          00:11:28       And now if the, they'll look at things like, uh, the, the wars in the Middle East and it just seems like, to me it seems like they have a tendency to always try to blame the religiously motivated violence because I think they've kind of got themselves on like team anti-religion. We're on team atheist, so the Muslims have to be worse than the American military because they're, the religious ones were like sophisticated and advanced and everything about the, the u s military is built on like science and reason and thought.

Speaker 2:          00:11:54       And the, these are crazy Muslims who are just maniacs. So we have to blame them. Even though if you look at the numbers of dead, it's pretty staggeringly one side, like we're murdering them. Not only that, we're also in where they live. So that has to be taken into account. When we had to get there, we had to go there. I understand, but let's just look at the actual facts cause it's not cassie judge. Let's look at the facts. We are where they live. Um, we don't speak their language. We come in and mass and we kill a fuck load. More people than they do. And the a good percentage of the people that are in the military. Christian, yes, very decent size. Uh, a very, a very big percentage. And then a very big percentage of like the hardcore supporters, the people like who are really hardcore, the evangelical base that voted for George W. Bush.

Speaker 2:          00:12:41       A big part of that support is this goofy religious belief that we need to be pro Israel because the Jews need to be in Israel and that's what then Jesus can come back for us and if some Muslims got to get slaughtered in the process, well this is how it's supposed to go, so we got to protect that. There's a lot of that weird shit on our side as well. A lot of weird old southern money that goes into that. Yeah, there's a great vice piece on those people. There's a great vice piece where they, I forget, you know, vice has someone in those online shows that are awesome. It's hard to know which one it was, but they went with these people to Israel, these crazy evangelicals who are going back to the motherland and it's like they were like, well, this is where Jesus is going to camp.

Speaker 2:          00:13:22       You know, this is where we're going to set up his fire here and he'll pull his trailer in right here like they had, it was almost like that and his head, like he was setting up to Budweiser's one from me, one for Jesus when he gets here. Weird, weird. But you if you're on the right, like even Gavin McInnes who I love, I love Gavin Love Gavin. Gavin's a bright, bright guy, but he's also a Catholic and he became a Catholic like late in life. So I'm like, what are you doing? Like what do you, what is this like you, it's almost like you have to be a part of something that's religious to get in on the right side. Like a Glenn Beck became a Mormon when he was like 50 like, hey dude, come on. Did you even read it? Did you read any of the history about Joseph Smith being 14 when he made all this shit up?

Speaker 2:          00:14:08       Magic seer stone that he had to use to read the golden tablets that contained the loss work of Jesus that only he could read with this rock. I'm torn between whether I hate mormonism for that or I love them for that. I'm like, Hey, if we're going to bullshit, let's just go bullshit. Like, yeah, Jesus, he lives in Kansas. I don't know. He was friends with my grandpa. Why not? Well, the American Indians were actually from Israel. That was another one of his, that this guy spent a ton of money. Um, you know, we were talking with when Sam was here the other day, we were talking about how 15 years ago it was like billions of dollars to get your genome map. Now it's like a couple thousand bucks. And we were talking about how crazy that is. Like what would an insane leap, well, a few years back, one of the, before it became that cheap, some dudes spent a fuck ton of money.

Speaker 2:          00:14:53       It was a mormon to try to prove that the Morman scriptures were in fact correct. And the American Indians did come. But we learned from that actually it's actually want up being good for science because these guys spent so much money, we realized, no, they actually came from Siberia. So reinforces the idea of them crossing the landmass, the bering strait and coming into America from Asia. So they are Siberian like it's, it's, it's interesting like the, the, the merge or the, um, the movement and migration of people from Asia to North America and down into Mexico. And if it's really fucking cool when you find out that it's not that long ago, well, a few thousand years, you know, at the most 20, you know, whatever it was like during the ice age. It's not that long ago, man. It's, it's crazy. A history is a weird thing like that. Like even when we talk about thing and you know, you'd be like World War II, World War Two was like that long ago.

Speaker 2:          00:15:40       Like your grandfather was there and like that's, that's, that's just happened. Just happened historically. You have Vietnam and how about Vietnam? There's one that this conspiracy theories can really grab a hold of the Gulf of Tonkin. Well, yeah, like Wah. That's, but that's my point when before it's like, why are we even wasting our time with anything else? Right. Let's grab that one and hold on to that one. That was bullshit. We know that was bullshit. Tens of thousands of Americans died in that war, let alone how many Vietnamese we just slot. It was just like mass slaughter that people made billions off of that was bullshit. Bullshit. Bullshit. You don't need anymore. We flag attack. Yeah. Look it up folks. I mean if you're listening to this going what you sitting on your porch and Georgia with your lemonade hating black people just go online and it's fun. I get it.

Speaker 2:          00:16:27       He doesn't want to sit on their porch with lemonade and hate black people. I know. I do. If you, if you really do read that story, it's horrific. And then you realize, oh well this was deception was the rule of the land at that time. This was when they had the operation northwoods, um, thing that had been passed. And if you haven't seen that document, that's crazy. They, this was signed by the Joint Chiefs of staff and then vetoed by Kennedy where they were going to attack American civilians. They were going to bomb, they were going to bomb Guantanamo Bay, they were going to arm Cuban friendlies and they were going to give them weapons to attack Guantanamo Bay. They were going to blow a drone jetliner out of the sky, blame it on Castro and wind up killing a ton of people. And they were doing it all just to get support of this idea of attacking Cuba.

Speaker 2:          00:17:15       So they were going to pretend that all these people died, you know, and, and just, you know, we're going to add, I don't know, how could they take off in a plane that then, I'm not sure where the drone technology was that, but this was the plan. I mean it was, it was a plan that I think Kennedy himself had to, had to veto but not sign off on it or whatever. Um, and you know, they took care of him quickly, allegedly. That's the other conspiracy, right? Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone, seems to me to be even a dumber conspiracy. Then there was a bunch of people involved killing that guy. Couldn't agree with you more on that one. But it's, it's just the, the north would think it's just a fascinating, you know, glimpse into

Speaker 1:          00:17:49       the mindset of the people who are, who are on the inside, who really do view the world as, as pawns on a chess board. And if, you know, uh, if a lie is what it took to get the geopolitical result that they wanted and some Americans had to die or whatever, that's not a big deal. And, and I think people should be aware of that. Like anyone, a lot of times, like you were talking about getting in the team mentality, people kind of have this team mentality and they're like, well, they don't, you know, if someone's willing to just slaughter people in a third world country to make their buddies rich, I'd be careful with them around your kids too. You know, like they're, they're probably looking at everybody like their pawns on a board, not just those guys. Yeah, I think people learn really quickly how to disassociate.

Speaker 1:          00:18:31       They learn how to not think about that. Especially when you're using like drone technology and stuff. You're flying a robot and shooting missiles out of a robot. And you're watching it all on a screen. How easy is it to distance yourself from that if you're the person, not even he's pushing the button, but who gave the order to give the, okay. You know, and when I talked to Ed, Mike Baker on here was a former CIA operative. I had been on a few Fox News shows with him. He told me all that stuff is done by lawyers. They all decided like, can we do this? Can we do this? And the lawyer sit down, they hash it out and they give him the green light or the red light. I'm like, Whoa, that is fucking dark when you're leaving military matters. And whether or not you attack with a flying robot to lawyers, arguably the most heartless creatures I've ever created in our capitalist society.

Speaker 1:          00:19:15       Well that's that. And by the way, that's who's running government. It's all lawyers do it. Hillary Clinton is, was that Obama is what Michelle Obama is. But Bill Clinton was, I mean, that's what they all are. They're all lawyers, great lawyers. There's awesome people out there that are lawyers. That's not what I'm saying. But even if you're an awesome person that's a lawyer, you fucking know some psychos. Let me tell you, the awesome person who was a lawyer is the most adamant, like, do not put lawyers in charge. Do your job. Do you not? That's like, look, I'm a comedian. But if you were like, should comedians being charged or it'd be like Jesus, no, we won't. We won't make it through this podcast. Yeah. They shouldn't be in charge of anything. Even comedy. We shouldn't be in charge. Yeah, exactly right. Cause then you get like these salt rooms, they get mad at you if you talk loud.

Speaker 1:          00:19:54       But like when people are in charge of anything they fuck. Oh yeah. But uh, you were talking about the drone wars. Um, there's, this guy is brilliant historian, Tom Woods. I don't know if you've heard of him, but he's got a great podcast. He's incredible. This guy like I to me, like maybe like the smartest libertarian voice out there. What's his podcast called? It's called the Tom Woods show. Oh yeah. You should, you would love him. I think he would be great on you. I didn't know he had a podcast. He's got a podcast. He's just a brilliant historian. He nails all this stuff, but he uses this analogy and I love it. Uh, he just goes through, imagine we, we used the drone campaign, like imagine we, we fought crime that way. So, you know, imagine there'd be like, someone was like a, so we've got, um, to suspected criminals at a wedding in, in, you know, California somewhere. And I go, so the plan is we're going to bomb the wedding.

Speaker 2:          00:20:49       Everybody just be like, oh, that's not okay. You can't do that because there's, there's innocent human life there. But literally we, that's just how we conduct the war in the Middle East. Yeah. But they don't, it's sort of disingenuous because they don't know it's a wedding. They just see a group of people gathered and then they know that the dickheads in there and they want to blow them up. And then it turns out to be a wedding. And we were like, Oh shit. Okay. So still the analogy say that's how we fought crime. Here we go. But we just followed the metadata on your cell phones and wherever you happen to be, we're going to blow that place up. Yeah. That's what's important to point out too, is that they're shooting at phones and then they don't even have a visual id on the person. They, they find where the phone is.

Speaker 2:          00:21:32       They do the find my iphone feature with the eye in the sky and then they launch aptly named Hellfire missile at it. That's dark too, that they have cool nicknames for their missiles. Hell fire. Oh Dude. They do all this shit. Well, although like you're saying like the operation names, operation kick ass, I said, Jesus Christ, it's just fucking 18 year olds blast and ACDC rolling through some time in town. It's like Jesus. Well have you ever seen those pieces that they've done on those kids that were, were involved in operating those tanks? It would listen to metal. I mean that's, that's bizarre too. You're letting these kids get jacked up on metal and who knows what else you let them have. They probably let them have amphetamines. They definitely let them have steroids. They give steroids to soldiers. That's, that's common shit man. There's a reason they prefer an 18 year old to a 30 year old.

Speaker 2:          00:22:27       There's a reason they prefer someone who is still just as good fighting shape or whatever, you know, essentially. But then when you're 18 you're, you're in a different place, your levels are at a different place and your, your willingness to follow orders, I think as a mother is in a different place. We're all essentially like, you know, older people being wiser if they've had enough experiences. But we're all gathering experiences, gathering experiences and then calculating, trying to figure out, okay, why did that go wrong? Well what does that, oh here's that fucking thing again. Oh here's this thought, let's see how it goes. And that's why as people get older, they get less and less tolerant of certain things because they see these things over and over and over again. And they recognize these patterns. You get more confident in your assertion of that pattern cause you're like, I've seen this bullshit six times now.

Speaker 2:          00:23:07       I know. And it works that way with politics too. Like, that's the common expression about radicals in college. You know, a, show me a young man who's not a liberal and I'll show you a man without a heart. Show me an old man is on a conservative and I'll show you a man without a brain, right? Because after to why you go, ah, I see. You know, and it's not black and white when it comes to that issue, but when you're, you're dealing with something that, you know, a human being that gathers up this data. When you were 18, what do you got? A couple of fucking birthday parties. You remember the first time you get your Dick sucked was only six months ago. Like, what do you remember? What do you, what do you have to base on? What do you, what do you know? Movies. You watch a lot of movies. That's probably what they're basing

Speaker 1:          00:23:46       it on. What they think their life's going to be. Some fucking Tom Hanks movie, they'll come back and cry to their kids when they're younger, when they're older, rather about the, you know, I served in the war of serving my country. Did my country proud. Now you're, you might go home with no legs. Like you're in a crazy situation where you're killing people. You don't know because someone you don't know told you you're supposed to kill people you don't know. And a lot of them figure it out. It's just they figured out when they see that real shit that you're talking about. Cause you know, there is also, that's another thing that's very, very downplayed. But uh, that should have been maybe the biggest story in at least one of the biggest stories in the last 10 years is that Ron Paul in 2000 in the 2008 run and in the 2012 Ryan both runs, he got more money, more donations from active duty military people than all of the other candidates.

Speaker 1:          00:24:30       He got more than the, all the Republican candidates combined in 2012 and he got he outraised uh, Barack Obama both times. So it's like there's actually a lot of people in this military, in the military who see through this bullshit and we're very happy to have like the only, I mean Ron Paul to me is like the only politician on a presidential level in recent memory who has been unapologetically antiwar and not just not just like this hasn't worked like this is bullshit racket, and we started it. Yeah. Yeah. When you get that many active military on your side, you really have to really think, well, these are the people that are dealing with this issue. It's a part of their life. It affects their families, it affects their friends, their loved ones, all the people they serve with. The whole thing is it's so hard to believe that they've been able to keep this going for so long and this war with no end, this war against terrorism is one of the most devious things because whether or not terrorism exists, it certainly does.

Speaker 1:          00:25:27       Whether or not we have to combat terrorism, we certainly do. Whether or not we have to take measures to ensure the safety of the people. We definitely do 100%, but there's something really suspicious about an unnamed enemy or an unseen and Miller and an enemy. That's just terrorism. It's like a, it's like herpes just floating through all these parts of the world. Like you don't even have a, we don't, it's not even a country with a leader anymore. Like now it's just terrorism. Well, it works out pretty great if you're like a weapons company that's making more money than ever, or if you, if you want it to keep this military budget, you know, I mean, uh, the, you know, people were, I liberals were all outraged over George W Bush's military budgets and Obama greatly expanded those. And uh, so yeah, if you're making tons of money off it, it works out great to have kind of this vague concept that we're fighting a war against. [inaudible].

Speaker 1:          00:26:14       I, I do think terrorism, obviously, like you said, exists. I think terrorism, as Pat Buchanan said, is the price of empire. And it kind of always has been, and this is what we're going to be dealing with as long as we want to have an empire in the Middle East. Right. But now it's not, it's not like a one particular enemy. It's this vague threat of attacks by irrational people. And then you see them scattered throughout the world and other places where they don't have the kind of security that we do. Right. So it reinforces idea or idea that the TSA is, and you've got to get through that line and you gotta be nice to these people. And though they failed on like 95%. Did you see that test? They felt 95% of the like fake knives and bombs. These are all getting it and they're just, they're just feeling up old people.

Speaker 1:          00:26:55       Yeah. They felt me up the other day. Did they need to check my dick happened to me at the back of his hand. He had to go up to both sides of my Dick. Did it give you the nice ex ex, uh, explanation about how he's going to do it? And so we're going to feel what the back of our hand, the guy who did it to me, and like I said earlier, I'm no conspiracy theorist, but when they're like, you've been randomly selected for additional screening and inside, I'm like, what was that last podcast? Huh? I hit something. Is that what you know, may stuff which, you know what he said to me? She goes, no, that would be, that would be more uncomfortable. But he said before he did it, I don't know if the guy said it to you, but he goes up if you want, we can bring into a private room for this.

Speaker 1:          00:27:32       Yeah, they did say that. It was like two, we're going to do this right here. Right now in a private room. You Go, yeah, you're going to play George Michael's music. Yeah. It's um, I don't know. I mean, but it's so convenient that they need to kind of security that the NSA was trying to get, or they're the kind of, um, not security, but I'm the kind of invasion of privacy that the NSA was doing with monitoring your metadata, the ability to check all your emails and the fact that what snowden exposed was kind of everybody's worst fear about all this stuff was that one day we're going to get to a point where they're recording everything and you're always going to be scared to speak your mind in the private and public with your friends because you think they could always here. And if there's certain key things that you say that upset them while they could just target you.

Speaker 1:          00:28:19       Like they were talking about people in the NSA, we're actively targeting their exes email accounts. Oh yeah. And reading their exes emails. What does this, this is just, of course it's going to happen. It's human beings. A buddy, a friend of mine worked at a bank and he told me how they had a big problem with people like checking on celebrities, accounts, checking on other people, other friends of theirs accounts. It's, it's human nature. I think personally, I think the biggest thing that snowden exposed more so than any particular program was that he exposed that that guy clapper said, you know, the clapper was I think just six months a year before snowden released those files through Glenn Greenwald at the Guardian. He, he, before a congressional hearing goes, there is no bulk mass data collection. And that's what's amazing about what Snowden, you know, showed you that they will just understand that they will lie through their fucking teeth to you. Like they're liars, they're not like misguided or they don't know what's happening. It's, it's, you know, they're telling you what they think you need to know so they can get away with their bullshit. And that to me is, is a very important thing for people to realize. Well, that's the, the real insidious problem with the US versus them idea is that they're just people too. So you've people that are operating these mass surveillance programs on other people. There's nothing like, there's nothing essentially noble about

Speaker 2:          00:29:42       them. They haven't passed any tasks. They haven't shown themselves to be some people that are devoid of jealousy and pettiness and clear thought always. And they're just the smartest people we know. So we give them this position cause there's so they're like the knights of the watch, you know? Right. You just go otherwise overlords. Sorry. We'll watch us. They will walk. They protect us. I was arguing with a, what's his name or who you bro brought up? Baker. Uh, I was on a panel with him on, on a Fox News show and we were talking about, it was the apple when apple versus FBI thing, which I guess is still going on. But uh, so I was kind of siding with apple and he was siding with the FBI. I remember bigger said to me, he goes, he was like, Dave, what are you worried? Are you worried they're going to be checking your emails or checking your phone?

Speaker 2:          00:30:23       You know, like that kind of attitude. How was like the FBI was spying on civil rights leaders being run by a cross dressing maniac like yeah, I don't trust these people are going to, I don't trust those people anymore than I trust any group of people. You have. The fact that they think that that organization has been cleaned up like how much j Edgar Hoover and what they did during the bullets. It's coming out now more. It's really interesting the stories that are coming out now about how the war on drugs was a big part of their plan to try to break down the civil rights movement and break down these anti war protesters because this one thing they shared in common, they were all doing drugs. So he said, okay, this will just have a fucking crazy war on drugs and we just go in and get these people, they're going to be smoking pile, which is arrest the shit out of them and just break up everything.

Speaker 2:          00:31:09       And they really did. And it was, it's brilliant in terms of like strategy, if you're going to go after your enemies. I mean it's, it's a great way to do it. But we're still suffering the consequences of Nixon's actions from Jad or hoovers guidance. I mean that that was all, that's the whole pile that that was operating under. Yeah. And then you get this whole, like it spawns this whole system of mass incarceration and private prisons and this whole nightmare or hoover was awesome though. You got to love with the bad ass. Who's wearing a dress like cross dressing, banging dude's keeping secrets. Not only doing that today when it's cool he was doing this at a time when like if it came out, people would be just, I mean you're ruined. Well that was how he kept it all under wraps. He, the reason that guy was so into getting into other people's Shit, just cause he had so much shit to expose.

Speaker 2:          00:31:56       He's like, well I can't let this get out. I gotta be proactive. I just got to gather up data on everybody. Fuck Elvis. Fuck Jimmy page. Yeah. But I just went after everybody. I also think that there's something inherently, like if you're in the cross dressing, banging dudes scene, you're going to meet other people with dirt too. That's like, you know the other guy who you're, you're like, hey, look, we both know where in that scene together, so you keep your mouth shut. That's true too. But I was like, that's one of those things where people always say that, uh, if you, uh, are with a partner and that partner, all of a sudden it starts getting like crazy, irrationally jealous. It's probably because they're doing something sneaky. Yeah. You know, and what he was doing was sort of that he was jagger, hoover was a fucking maniac, and he was in charge of the FBI. I mean, he was just a bonafide, insane person.

Speaker 1:          00:32:40       But, but like you said, it's like who's to say they're cleaned up? I think we always have this, this like idea that we get comfortable with the fucked up shit in the past. So we were like, oh, this was so fucked up. But now it's not like that. But you know, we, we love to look back at slavery or look back at Jim Crow or look back at something, oh, what were these people thinking? But if you look at, I mean mass incarceration for nonviolent crimes or mass slaughter in the Middle East or any of this stuff that these people believe me, if, if all the details of what's going on came out in 20 years, we're going to have the same attitude in 20 years and be like, man, I'm fucked. I'm fucked up. Shit going on in 2016. Well you know what's interesting to me, there's even tribalism in the government, like the CIA and the FBI can't get along, which is how, um, what's his name?

Speaker 1:          00:33:25       General. I'm the guy who got busted for cheating on his wife. Patraeus so trays, that's how betrays got caught. The at the FBI was spying, was gone after the CIA. So not only that, but it's craziness. Dianne Feinstein, who is the head of the Senate intelligence committee. Okay. So they're, they're tasked with overseeing the CIA. She came out and said that the CIA is spying on them. Like I don't know exactly how they figured it out, but she came out and said, so the CIA was spying. But yeah, this doesn't get big story on like a big story on the new CIA spying and the people who oversee the CIS supposedly, we have no clue. Rand Paul came out and said something along the lines of, he was like, we don't even know who's running this thing when it comes to government. So I think the thing that Libertarians, Rand Paul said that, yeah, he said this like a year and a half ago when he was still doing well.

Speaker 1:          00:34:13       He actually should know. That's why that's a scary thing. Like he actually should, he's probably talking to me, but there's also this weird thing where like, I don't know exactly how it works, but there's this weird thing where like they'll tell you stuff but then you can't talk about it to anyone if it's like classified. So a lot, there's actually congressmen who don't want the classified information because they want to be able to say whatever they want to be able to say. It's a, it's a whole cluster fuck. But I think this is one of the things that Libertarians, uh, at least the type of libertarian that I am, like that school of thought, it really tries to emphasize, just don't look at government as if it's a different entity from humanity. We're all people, right. So it's like, like you were saying before, like the CIA and the FBI, they're not one monolith.

Speaker 1:          00:34:56       It's different power sources, different groups of people. And Yeah, of course they all are incentivized the way people are. And they're a corporation, like any other business where there's a bunch of people that are backstabbing each other trying to get to the top of the ladder. Yup. So they're fucking each other over inside the tribe. Yup. There's a lot of that going on. It's fucking weird world man. When you hear someone like Ran Paul saying, we don't know who's running this thing. That's the government, the whole government of the United States, he's talking about, he's talking about the strings behind the strings and we don't know who's running it. Well, I mean, you see this, this, it's very interesting when you hear like a, like Hillary Clinton, it came out in one of these, uh, in one of her last batch of emails that that got like released it, it was like her and her team were bragging about how she had convinced Obama to go ahead with regime change in Libya.

Speaker 1:          00:35:47       Oh, that's right. And then gates comes out and writes his book and he's like, look, I was against it. Hillary was for, so it's, it's just this fucking like, you convinced the guy and now this country is fucked. Well, she and all. Yeah. And well also did you, I'm sure you saw the time where she was being interviewed and she was laughing about Kadafi Diane. We came, we saw he died when I said, there's, there's video evidence of her being a sociopath. I don't understand. It's not cut off. He didn't just die right before that. It's not just that you're talking about a human being who died. Okay. Kadafi died the way that dictators fear you die. His people got a hold of him and beat him and sodomized him to death. He got like, I mean, it's about as disturbing as it could be. What?

Speaker 1:          00:36:35       Again, back to her laughing about getting the child rapist off. She then a few days later she's just cackling it up. There's a video of a guy stabbing him in the ass hole. I mean, it's insane. You've seen that, right? He takes that knife and he shoves it in his ass. Yeah. While they're talking to them and Kadafi so fucked up. He doesn't even know what's happened. He's like in a state of shock or some shit. There's a knife in his ass. All these people have a hold of them. They're all yelling alla walk bar. Yeah, it's, that's, that's a bad way to go. It's a crazy way to go. I wonder if that guy with the knife in his ass, I wonder if that will be like, you know that he would, Jima statue. They plant the flag. They'll make a statue of the one guy with a knife up Qaddafi's ass.

Speaker 1:          00:37:18       It's like over your fireplace in his neighborhood. That will be like, you know, that'll be his monument. I mean, it's uncle, he stopped because after you in the ass, there's a video on youtube, show it Mama, and she puts it on the big screen. Everybody watches it. Yay. It's closing your ears. Bomb bombs going off the background. Cause Libby's even more fucked up now than it was then. That regime change was terrible for the people who live there. Oh, it's not even, you know, I think we lose sight of it sometimes when you, you'd be like, you know, it's like, oh well they're always fucked up. So it's a little bit more fucked up. But, but Libya was by regional standards, one of the better places to be in the Middle East and it is now. I mean, uh, a failed state. It's, I mean, it's just run by thugs and terrorist organisms, organizations.

Speaker 1:          00:38:03       It's, it's a nightmare. Yeah. It's a, it's a breeding ground for isis now. Isis is all over the place there now. She's weird. She's weird because she gets all these free passes because she's a woman. It's very strange because that's, that's a a giant part of why people want to support her. It's almost like, you know, we got one of ours in, you know, we're going to get one of ours in. Like my wife wants a vote for it because she's a woman. I go, if you have paid attention to what a country is, have you really read, allegedly I should say Clinton toxic and things. I'm sorry, I don't mean it. I'm saying all this for humor. She's, I mean she's not the woman you want to sound what you're looking for. You, she's not a scholar. Well it's not a wise woman who's got some really kind words to say she's a lifelong career politician and like you said, and that always, I mean if you talk to any Hillary supporters, it is only sometimes it's not the first thing they say.

Speaker 1:          00:38:55       But if you give like give me three reasons why you want Hillary Clinton and one of them has to do with her being a woman. Yeah. I think it'd be great to see a woman do it for change. And by the way, that's what she runs on. She runs on women's issues. She plays that card all the time. I mean, she said like when Donald Trump called her on that, she was like, if I'm a kid is a playing the woman's card deal me. And that's her cadence by the way, it's always this not as knowing you, you need to be a little more noise. Just not the pitch. I don't have the pitch down. She's she substitute having no charisma with just volume, but she's like, I can just, if I go louder, maybe that's charismatic wishes. She doesn't just have no charisma. She's oddly transparent in her creepiness.

Speaker 1:          00:39:37       Like when she's doing these debates and Bernie Sanders is calling her out on taking all that money from the banks and how she does his speeches for quarter million dollars and he liked to read the transcripts. She just sitting there and while he's doing that, just like this weird, like the seething angry over here. She's smiling on the outside, but you know, deep down she could fucking kill you like it. And she's going over her preparation because they prepped her for this. So you know, it come, it comes out in this weird sort of robotic I kido move where she's trying to push it to the side. Like it's a fucking thug and a Steven Seagal movie. It's weird man. She doesn't really answer it in a way. It's the only thing that I find a positive about Hillary Clinton is that you can constantly, you can see through her and you can point to that shit and other people and go but see how she's full of Shit.

Speaker 1:          00:40:24       But how about for the woman card thing? Just the fact that uh, she's been taking like tens of millions of dollars from the Saudi government, something like $100 million from Muslim dictatorships. How can you run on the women's issue? It's like being a Jew, running on Jewish issues and you do business with the Nazis. So this, this money and does what with it? Well, they take it for the Clinton Foundation, which is like her and bill and Chelsea's foundation and they do all these projects and it's all kind of in the name of charity in the name of philanthropy. But it's pretty clearly like you get like the Saudis aren't giving tens of millions of dollars to the Clinton Foundation cause they all of a sudden decided to be really good people. They're doing it because they know the Clintons wield a lot of influence and this is their way of giving them money. And the Clintons can use that as leverage to justify their association with them.

Speaker 1:          00:41:15       Cause look all the good it does good stuff. But in the meantime they can also do all these projects and lots of different companies can make money off these projects. And then they get in and we have this creepy business relationship with Saudi Arabia who is the worst of the worst. Like all the shit that we, you know, I love a, I love when the war machine, whenever there's a war they want, they get real humanitarian. All of a sudden like when Obama wanted to go back in a serious back into Iraq or when he wants to go into Syria, it's like, oh, these people are getting gassed or you know, there's a, there's a few hundred years. Eddie is up on the top of a mountain and they could die. But when, when Saudi Arabia is slaughtering their own people, when, when Saddam was gassing people and we liked him, that was fine. It's only when, when you're on the wrong side of whatever business deal we are, we have going on. All of a sudden they're like, but think of the people. All of a sudden John Mccain cares about Muslim people.

Speaker 1:          00:42:06       He's playing poker and it's phone. Wait, hold on. This john for a moment and talk about the people. It's a little suspicious. Well it's less suspicious now I guess then it was in the 1960s and in the 1950s probably before that was even more fuckery going on. But it seems like it's more and more difficult to pull off the really obvious operation northwoods type shit. Like there the transparency that we are enjoying today even though there's still a lot of questions like what Jeb Bush was or would um, uh, ran. Paul was saying like we really have no idea who's running the whole thing at the very top. It seems like that's going to be exposed to eventually it's all going to get chipped away because information just travels weight quicker now than it ever did before and it's just too hard to hide shit. You know?

Speaker 1:          00:42:49       It's like that's it. That force is on their side too though. Like we have that force of like information can spread but they also have the Predator drones. Like there was no way a president in the 50s or whatever could have just had the option to say bomb Yemen, Syria, Libya and Pakistan and all these different countries without sending troops there are having bases nearby. So you know, we have advantages. They have advantages. Yeah. But it's taught. What I was going to get at is that what's interesting is what we're seeing now from the, like the NSA gathering data on everybody saying we needed to PK, but he's safe. It's almost, it almost mirrors like with j Edgar Hoover was doing, cause j edgar hoover had all that dirt on him and so to hide it, he just went after everybody else. Keep everybody quiet. Everybody scared.

Speaker 1:          00:43:34       That mean you could make that same comparison to this strategy. The NSA is employable. Look, we'll just fucking monitor everything and then if, if I say, oh this dave guys been talking to a lot of shit, let's check his emails and it's going to go back. Oh look at all this. I was joking and I just want to say already I was joking, but you know what I'm saying. I mean that's an insidious sort of device that they can use to keep you quiet. Well. How about the fact that it, you know, in 20 years, right, if there's some leader who's coming up who, who is a would be, you know, some type of great leader, they're going to have grown up just entirely in the Internet age where the, if you have all of their metadata history, you have everything on that person and then they can literally just go like, we want to ruin that guy and everybody's got something that could be a, an issue you could insert into a campaign should ruin them or you know, if you don't, you're boring. Yeah, yeah, that's right. And then I don't want you president anyway. If they can't ruin you by checking your that I don't even want

Speaker 2:          00:44:32       you, that's a great way to put it. If you can't be ruined, I don't want you to be my leader. Are you? You fucking Weirdo. You pious Weirdo from birth. Yeah. It's like you've just been clean, like going like, well Ha, I'll get power Sunday as long as I don't fuck up and all that. Oh she looks pretty but stay hungry. We taught him while he was in his crib. Keep your cards close to your tests, Donnie. But that's like the thing where they said isn't about George Washington because they tried to make him out to be such a great word. They're like, his father was like, did you cut down that cherry tree? And he was like, father, I can't tell a lie. Like what type of fucking creep was George Washington? Or maybe had her like a really open relationship with his dad or just a dad who loved him.

Speaker 2:          00:45:07       Stand out really cool and he knew, hey man, somebody chop the tree down. You've got blisters in your hand. The fuck's going on, Bro. I mean, there's just really compelling evidence or maybe yet never fucking happened. You know? That's the other maybe more likely. Yeah. Yeah. I mean all these stories that you get from the 16 hundreds like, come on, man, those are barely people. Those were monkeys with clothes on it. They barely know how to write. And, and historians like to tell it as if they know for a fact what happens. Rather than just being like, Hey, here's a nice guests at what maybe happened. They'll be like, he thought about going left, but then he went right and it was kind of like, alright, yeah. I've always wondered if one day they'll be able to create a computer that's so powerful that it will be able to somehow through some unseen technology, take account of everything that's in place as it is right now in the world.

Speaker 2:          00:45:57       Then monitor for a certain amount of time and then go backwards and try to figure out, well, all of these things got into place because of these events and these motions and be able to recreate it digitally. It sounds ridiculous right now, but if we can get to a place where they can literally do an account of everything that's happened, everything, every pebble that's on this earth and go, you know what? We can extrapolate. We can take all this data and follow it for a short amount of time and then within the 99% accuracy, go back in time and recreate events. I can, that sounds so stupid and ridiculous, but that might be like almost a method of a virtual time travel. Like just super calculation. You just take into account all the things that we do, know all the pieces that are in place right now.

Speaker 2:          00:46:48       Everything that's there, all the people that are there and then figure out how they got their account for all factors. Account for everything. I'm massive, super calculations. Impossible for the human mind to even conceive of. And then boom, they have a digital recreation of George Washington fucking his sister and lying about the cherry tree. It was full of shit like to black people on fire. Whoa. George Washington was a piece of shit. Oh, allegedly. I don't mean that for allegedly, you know what I'm saying? Alleged cones, allegedly a piece of shit being credible. I mean if they could literally get to a position where they could do a calculation that's so complete that they could feed it into some sort of, uh, you know, someday created virtual reality machine that will give you like a version of that. You can go back and watch the asteroid that killed the dinosaurs.

Speaker 2:          00:47:37       If humans can manage to not like destroy ourselves or we don't have some asteroid reset or something like that, we're going to do magical shit like that. I'm sure. I mean, we're on, we're already doing magic compared to what we could do a hundred years ago. So I mean we're gonna it's the thing is you can never predict what it would be exactly. Like you can never stand back and you know, you can't stand back in the year like 1850 and going to be like, it'll be metal machines running on dinosaur juice. You know, like you just wouldn't know. But uh, we'll be doing some magical shit. Well, Sam Harris was talking about it and it was four Rican me out because he was talking about the power that computers are going to have once they, once artificial intelligence become sentient, the power that they're going to have to improve upon themselves and how quickly that's going to take place, where thousands of years of progress it's going to take place in a week.

Speaker 2:          00:48:25       And you're like, wait, wait, wait, wait, what? And then it's just from there. Each, each time the improve, it improves exponentially. Thousands more years, maybe in an hour, thousands more years in a couple of seconds. It's just going to get to some insane place where he's saying they're reasonably certain that one day we'll have a machine. It's like an Adam machine that you could shoot out into the universe and given an amount of time extracting all the building materials and needs from the sky, it will make a planet. It'll make a planet and inhabit that planet with intelligent life. And then we can go there and it'd be like Miami in the sky. We'll go there. There'll be, I mean, literally you could create anything. You might already be living in it. How we all got here, even want to Elon Musk's more recents talks. He talked about that. But a lot of people had been saying that for a long time.

Speaker 2:          00:49:13       But it's, it's potentially possible that one day we're going to have an artificial reality that's into indecipherable or, uh, or you can't tell the difference between what is fake and what is real. You will not be able to stay in. Wish it, it will, it will be so good that it will be just like life. So if that's the case, how do you know that you're not already in it? Right. You don't, you know, and it's, it's all, it's all Mumbo jumbo right now. Unless you think that it could've already happened, then it's not Mumbo jumbo. And if Harris has, right, the real problem with that, and this is not even his ideas, this is all these people that are really at the forefront of all this technology. We're going to be, we're not, we're not going to be, but something is going to be a god.

Speaker 2:          00:49:53       I mean, it literally is going to be able to create worlds. Yeah. It's potentially possible that one day they're going to have something that could create a universe. Yeah. I mean, look, I think there's a, there's an argument that that's how we were created. I mean we're here like we are here. We do exist. And truthfully in the reductionist, atheist scientific way of looking at it, there's no good reason for that. But you of course there is. See, I don't buy that because the universe is filled with magical shit. Like why wouldn't people be here? Like, well look at, look at supernovas. Look at black holes absorbing galaxies. Look at, let me look at solar storms. Look at flares. Look at this fucking ball of fire that's in the sky. That's a million times bigger than us. Why is it so weird that people exist? The whole thing is fucking madness.

Speaker 2:          00:50:41       Well that's, well that's I guess, yeah, I agree with you. I'm just saying the whole thing is magical already. So what's the, what's, you know, it's humans more magic. We're not any more magic than everything that's already out there. How about the Big Bang? The whole thing is based on magic. Yeah. He'll, the whole university of something being created from nothing smaller than the head of the pin and for whatever reason instantaneously explodes to sh to create all the mass, both seen and unseen. That's in the galaxy, including dark matter. You get through a conversation with this point where we show we almost should just come back to just being religious, like let's just follow the fucking book. That's what I'm saying like mormonism where it's so dumb that it's kind of comforting that you might be beating everyone. Yeah. That all these other people like joining on this dumb shit and you all agree and you call each other elders and you're only 12 there's something about just belief though, like like belief might be beating skepticism of just, just the way, I mean I know they do these things where they measure how your brain acts when those people are like speaking in tongues and stuff and you go to some weird place.

Speaker 2:          00:51:41       Then just convincing yourself to be certain of what this existence is might just put you on a whole different level. It's like, oh, it doesn't even matter what you're believing and you're just, as long as you're believing right. Well, it exists in a really practical form and fighting and no, you're, you're a big MMA. For him. It exists in a really practical form and fighting because, you know, when I, um, when I was coaching young people back, uh, during the, uh, taekwondo competing days, um, I coached a lot of young people and I brought a lot of people to tournaments and stuff like that, a lot of students. And one of the things that I've found was that smarter people had a harder time with competing, like, uh, like a lot of like the really smart people that I talked to. And then I would try to talk to them about it.

Speaker 2:          00:52:21       And what I realized is they're more aware of the variables, right? They're more aware of what could go wrong and that would create anxiety. And it was very difficult to get people to just like, okay, you have to stay on the path of what you're trying to do. You can't look off to the side of the road. The fact that this cliff goes a thousand feet down to the bottom of the canyon, you can't look at that. You've got to look on the road, just the road. And for a lot of smart people, they were like, fuck, what if I get hit? What happens if you get hit? Like, oh well you're fucked if you get kicked in the face. Yeah, don't get you in the face. Keep your hands up. You got to move. And um, dumb people were like convinced that they were going to be fine and I would, I was always fascinated by that.

Speaker 2:          00:52:58       I was like, this is weird because what's interesting is when the dumb people lost, it was way more difficult for them to rebound. Whereas the smart people lost and they go, all right, well I saw that common. Now I have to decide whether or not I still want to compete interests. Is this the risk I still want to take? Now I'm aware of the consequences. I knew it was coming, so what technically went wrong and how am I physically? And you would see people that were intelligent, rebound and they would figure out a way to overcome the challenge or try to at least. Whereas lot of smart people or a lot of dumb people rather were devastated by losses because it's almost like you took away that simple belief of theirs. Now they have to, you know, this one guy, I remember he was talking about how he was such a good person.

Speaker 2:          00:53:36       I can't believe this. You know, I, I followed the Lord's word. I'm a good person. Why God do this to me? I was like, oh no. Now he's questioning his very existence. Yeah, that's rough. That's a weird thing to see someone have that. Cause there's a, there's an amazing like confidence that you have to have a, or like, uh, at least you have to get yourself to that place. And it took like, you know, compete in mma, like you said, without looking at the side of the road. And when you see that broken, I mean, when I saw that, uh, that Ellen interview with Rhonda Rousey, Yeah. That was so crazy to me. That really made me go like, maybe she shouldn't fight for a little while. Like, I don't know if I like, she needs some more time off because this, she went from being the like, I'm going to kill everyone.

Speaker 2:          00:54:14       No one has a right to beat me. Don't be a b, nothing bitch. And being that chick to being like a, I wanted to kill myself. I've got to just have Travis Brown's babies. And I was like, Whoa, she's gone from being this like untouchable. I mean not even like she was like the best female fighter. It was like don't even, she's wrecking chicks in a second and then to seeing her kind of broken. Well, what's interesting is these themed play themselves out over and over again. And the traps are all there, but everybody keeps going for the candy and they keep getting caught in the traps. The traps of Hollywood are always there for any superstar athlete, especially fighters. And you know, we've seen it all throughout history with Tommy Morrison gets in the rocky movie and all of a sudden everybody's looking at him like Tommy Marson is going to be the white hub.

Speaker 2:          00:55:00       And then Ray Mercer beats the living fuck out of them. And you just saw like fear and overwhelming anxiety attack him cause he's in this movie and he's on the red carpet and everybody's saying, you going to be the champ one day, honey. I was like, Oh fuck. And then it becomes this whole thing. He's hanging with Sylvester stallone. They're probably doing blow and banging hookers allegedly, allegedly. But you know what I mean? It's like it becomes this Hollywood trap and Rhonda was a Jew and still is a giant superstar, right? She's this undefeated women's fighter. She's crushing all the competition. She looks like a destroyer and then the fucking traps this, all these movies start coming out, all this, all these deals start getting made. Books start getting written. All these television shows and all this stuff and all the traps and all those traps, they keep you focus.

Speaker 2:          00:55:47       They take steal little bits of your focus, like I'm good enough to get by without all that focus. But there's no way, because there's another person like you out there, there's a lot of people like you out there and they don't have those traps. And if they don't have those traps are going to have more attention that's being paid right away. They had an advantage because they have their full focused on this. And there's also something dangerous to someone like Rhonda Rousey. But by the way, obviously it's just incredible. I mean, she's the reason why women's mma is a huge thing. Uh, but I think there's something dangerous about being such an amazing grappler getting a couple of knockouts and all of a sudden feeling this kind of like, oh yeah, you know, she got the knee to a mcmahon and stops it with one knee.

Speaker 2:          00:56:26       And then what was the other chick who she, she hit the overhand who face planted Alexis Davis. Yeah. And so now it's kind of going in there and even going in there with like a world class, a boxer like a Holly Holm, she kind of goes in there with, they're like, well, I can knock people out too. And I think that's a dangerous, you know, all, you know what is a dangerous combination? It's like being a blue belt and he choked out a bunch of white belts and you think you're the shit and then all of a sudden you're rolling with Damien Maia and he wraps you up like a Christmas present. Beats the fuck out of you and chokes you. Unconscious easy. You know? I mean, there's levels of everything. And to deny those levels because anybody who looked at her fights would see like, okay, you have this Rhonda Rousey.

Speaker 2:          00:57:04       This fierce competitor was one of the best judo, um, examples of Judah. We've ever seen an MMA. I mean her judo spectacular reason why she was a medalist in the Olympics. I mean, she's a sensational competitor. Her grappling is outstanding. Her arm bar technique is amongst the best in the world, but she's knocking out these girls there. There's no, they're nowhere near Worldclass as far as like kickboxing and striking is concerned. Right. Holly Holm is 100% worldclass she is an 18 time world boxing champion. I mean she's a kickboxing champion. She was in, uh, an MMA competitor for a couple of years before she got into the UFC where she was having these ridiculous head kick chaos. Yeah. She's a beast. And for her to think that she's going to treat this woman, this Holly Holm woman, the same way she was able to bully like Batchko Heyah and I say billy, not in a negative way.

Speaker 2:          00:57:57       I mean just, just attacker and go after Batchko Hey, I was, she slow and awkward and not that athletic. Holly Holm bounces around that cage like a fucking kangaroo. Yeah. She does all these back flips and shit. She's spectacular. The athletic and the idea that you're going to have the same approach they used on Batchko go, hey, uh, with someone like Holly Holm, that's just madness. And that's something that happens when people get so absorbed with this idea that they're special. So absorbed with this idea that, you know, when you're on top, you think you are the fucking person. You're the woman, you're the man, you're the shit. No one's going to fuck with you. I'm just wandering through this bitch. And then you get cracked and then you realize, oh, this game doesn't give a fuck. This game doesn't give a fuck about your charisma. It doesn't give a fuck about the vegas odds.

Speaker 2:          00:58:41       It doesn't give a fuck about how much money you made or how many times you've been on entourage or amazing. It's an amazing thing about mma. It's why I have so much respect for everybody who competes. But it's like no one can escape this game's wrath. No, I mean, j like John Jones still has a lot of his career to go and he does. He has one loss on his record, but it was not dominant you when, uh, but you know, you see these guys, like you see Anderson Silva and he's just like, he's a Ninja. He's untouchable. He's the greatest fighter ever. And then you see him like crying on the ground with a shattered, not shattered, but whatever. When he broke his shin. Well, how about when he cried in the ground after he won against Nick Diaz? He fell to the ground

Speaker 1:          00:59:22       fighter ever. By the way, Nick Dsi is just, it's pretty awesome. I mean, the Diaz brothers are just the greatest fighters of all time. They certainly are. Um, yeah. But yeah, well, from going full circle then when he comes back and wins in the octagon. But I mean, it's, it's, it's an incredible thing. It makes you look, I mean, when watching Chuck Liddell, who I just, you know, at a certain point you were like, that guy's just unbeatable. He's like Superman. And then to see him getting knocked out and kind of his chin, you know, slowly start to go, yeah, it's, it's, it's like this, this game just came, doesn't give a fuck, doesn't give a fuck about your opinions. Doesn't give a fuck about what you think when knuckles hit Chin's legs go limp. And that's just how it goes. And we saw that in the rockhold bisping fight.

Speaker 1:          01:00:00       You know, rockhold had this look about him that almost like he was bored, that he was just like, I'm going to go. I mean, part of that I'm sure as gamesmanship, he's trying to get inside bisping's head that he's so much better than him, that he doesn't even have to like be serious and be concerned. And then bisbing clips him with his left hook over the shoulder where he's barely seen it. You called it, it was a greg, is that what you said? Like a few beats before that we were like, Luke rockhold is keeping his chin right up in the air and he's kind of like a little lacks of days ago. Yeah, I remember you, uh, in the, um, in the Hennen Barao dillashaw fight the first one, which is like a huge upset, no one saw that coming. Uh, and I remember you, you sang as it was, you're like, man, until the show is really light on his feet.

Speaker 1:          01:00:41       I was really relaxed. Like sometimes you could just see a little thing in the way they're moving. They like. Hmm. That's kind of interesting. Yeah. I was telling you before we started recording my, my buddy hilarious comedian, one of my best friends, Lewis j Gomez, he does a radio show with Michael bisbing. Right. And you've had a big Jay. I'm going to show the three of us do a podcast, a legion of skanks you you got to have Lewis on. You'll fucking, I would love to. He's like Jay. Yeah, Jay Jay is a, I've got a special coming out, which is going to be just incredible. What's it on? A comedy central hour. Oh, cool. I'll coming out on, I believe it's, I want to say June 17th, but I might like one of those days, it's called a live at webster hall. It's going to be a fucking incredible special look for that.

Speaker 1:          01:01:22       Jay Z, like one of the funniest comedians on the planet. Very funny. Louis J. Gomez is just one of the funniest people I've ever met in my life. He's a great comedian. He's like bigger than a standup comedian. He's like the Bert Kreischer of the east coast. He's just a hilarious person. Uh, but so he's doing a show with, with Michael Bisman, they do a show called the countdown on Sirius Radio and he started doing the show. I mean this is before bisbing has the Anderson Silva fight and it did almost seem kind of like bisping was a great fight or a big name, but seemed like he was kind of, you know, going towards the end of his career. Like he had a couple injuries, had the eye thing and you're kind of like, oh he was, he was a contender. Well explain the, I think cause the I think is pretty bad. Yeah. You probably know better than he has a detached retina and his oil in his eye, they had to inject oil into where his, I sit so that his retina won't tear again. So he has one eye that looks almost like cross side and it's kind of black like is like he's on ecstasy. Like one pupils dilated. It's very weird

Speaker 2:          01:02:20       and he doesn't give a fuck. He's got that one I fucked up and he doesn't give a shit. He's still going in there and settling in. That guy's born for this, this, this motherfucker went out and fought Anderson Silva won one of the gutsiest performances I've ever seen him. I mean he, the, the first two rounds that he beat Anderson were just incredible. And then the fact that he got almost put out in the third round and came back and won the fourth round and it was a fucked up thing because he was trying to say that his mouthpiece was out and he tried to circle to, I don't know who the referee was. Herb. Yeah. And he's like, but herb's like, look, it doesn't matter like you got to, I'm not stopping it. You don't, you can't call when to stop the action because you could say that the mouthpieces out or you could just spit your mouthpiece that whenever someone, you know, like landed a big show, people do time and people do do that.

Speaker 2:          01:03:08       But you know, herb was like, look, you can't say to me that your mouthpiece out, I know your mouth pieces out, but you got to keep fighting. Then boom, Anderson lands a flying knee on the jot and then Anderson walks away with his hands up. It's so crazy as if he won. So crazy. Herb didn't call the fight yet. So then the bell rings. So then bisping has to get up and recover in a minute from getting chaotic. It was madness. He got a little bit of extra time because Anderson Silva celebrate it. Yes. So I think he got like an extra 30 seconds or so. But I mean, but then right. So, and by the way to, that's got to fuck Anderson up to cause Anderson's, now I've got this like adrenaline dump and then you saw on his face, he's like, what? No, we're back to fighting it.

Speaker 2:          01:03:46       But bisping man, that fourth round, he just bit down on his mouthpiece and walked him down. Yeah, I mean it was incredible. Crazy. And then after that being the greatest ever to come and you get on a, on an injury, right? You get a title shot with 10 days' notice. He fights the greatest ever. I mean arguably Anderson's on the downslide but definitely, let's not say arguably, I mean losing twice to Weidman. He just didn't look the same when he fought Nick Diaz suspended for steroids, comes back and, and you know, but he's still Anderson Silva. So that victory, he gets that victor over the greatest of all time and then first round knockout over Luke rockhold you know, it's fucked up. I was, I was literally considering saying that Luke rockhold looks overconfident and when you're overconfident you can get knocked out. And I'm like, I don't want to be a deck.

Speaker 2:          01:04:31       And then boom, he gets knocked out. But you did make the comment about him holding a, about him not having his head right there on the center line of sort of relaxed. It was super relaxed with his chin straight up. He was pulling out of things with his chin straight up. It's almost like there was no danger. And that was one of the things that he was saying that, you know, he was in no danger. And it was also one of the same things that Uriah Faber was saying. Like the difference between me and cruises. I can hurt him, I can take him out. And then when you see your riot got caught, I think it was a second round, I got dropped and you realize he's in deep trouble. Like you realize holy Shit, like I can get knocked out too. And all those guys in, you know, it's, it's uh, it's funny when you get it like Michael Bisping was guy who the knock on him I guess was that he didn't have knockout power or whatever.

Speaker 2:          01:05:13       You're talking about like a a 200, I mean fighting at two. Oh, I got it cuts down probably, I'm sorry, one 85. So probably someone, someone who weighs close to 200 pounds. It's a 200 pound guy who specializes in, in striking. Yeah. And he can fucking knock you out of course. And he proved it. He doesn't, he doesn't fight like a, like a brawler like he fights like a technician. Yeah. And when you fight like a technician, you don't swing wild crazy ass punches with everything on them with your, you know, vandelay Silva style, you know, you try to find openings and that's what he did. He found the opening with that left hook was really sneaky. He had missed it before. He was like stepping in and throwing the left took over the shoulder and kind of like stepping into the punch. And boy when he caught luke, he caught him at the end of the chin, which really like fucking spins your head.

Speaker 2:          01:06:03       All the torque is perfectly placed and then you caught him with another brilliant one right afterwards. It's followed up. Yeah man. Dude. And you know he's had like all sorts of fucking crazy injuries. Back injuries, neck injuries, his fucking arm thing. Yeah, he's just tough man. He just keeps going. It just keeps going. She had no question about that. That dude's as tough as they come in. I know I'm never fixed him just because he's one of those guys who's like been around forever and always kind of been knocking at the door. So it's nice to see him. You know, get his moment well was crazy to see. Well you see like there's knockout power, right? And then there's like Dan Henderson Kinda knock out power that it's just like, Geez fucking cry. Like Dan Henderson feels like this table when you put your arm on him and he's not flexing.

Speaker 2:          01:06:45       He's like the, like Ryan Parsons, who's a buddy of mine who was his manager for a long time, said that he would do massage on him and he would be exhausted. He's like, he's would the guys made out of wood. So like when you look at them, you look at me go, well it looks like a, you know, strong athletic guy. But if you felt him, you realize where all this power comes from. He's like, he's built different, there's something going on with him. And he does. When you were saying people who don't put everything into one punch, he puts everything into it. I mean, it's like coming at Ya and it's so weird the way he moves to, he moves in a weird way because he's very stiff. He's not fluid like John Jones or like Anderson is very fluid in his movements. Dan is like very stiff, but when he uncorked those bombs on you, they just detonate and you're just like, what the fuck hit me like hector lumbar.

Speaker 2:          01:07:33       It's never been knocked out to see hector lumbar getting knocked out by, well, he got head kicked. He's probably stunned by that head kick and then he got blasted with that back elbow. He was out cold. He was out cold when he hit the ground and then Henderson blast them again but like, Whoa, I, I saw it. I was like, who the fuck hits? Like this guy is like, it's almost like you want him to hit you just so he could feel it a bit harder. Is that the normal what it, what the fuck are you doing? I want to start by like standing next to a guy who he hits like hit him real close to me. I want to feel it. His Kale of bisping UFC 100 was one of the most brutal one punch shots and the history of combat sports. It was just boom, bisping's dead stiff, and then Henderson's airborne long before the referee can get to them and just slams him in the face on the way down.

Speaker 2:          01:08:19       And then from there out, one of his logos was the silhouette of him flying through the air and knocking out bisbing. So imagine being best bang. Not only do you have to deal with the fact this guy fucking knocked you out in spectacular fashion, but his logo is flying through the air, hitting you after you're already unconscious. I would, I would just say, hang on. In a few years, you'll be champ and you'll have a show with Louis J. Gomez and everything will be good. What year was UFC? 200 it's a wild man. That was brock lesnar. I want one. Yeah, 100 yeah. 100 was like,

Speaker 3:          01:08:56       was it 2012 no, earlier than that, probably. What year was that, Jamie?

Speaker 2:          01:09:02       I just pulled something up. It wasn't ufc one 14 popped up. It wasn't definitely, wasn't that right? It was UFC 100 yeah. Let me see.

Speaker 3:          01:09:10       Yeah,

Speaker 2:          01:09:10       it was the biggest paper view of all time was brock Lesnar's rematch with Frank Mir and GSP photo tiago album 2009 2009 it was that long ago.

Speaker 3:          01:09:21       Whoa. That's nuts.

Speaker 2:          01:09:24       Yeah, that was fucking weird. It's been a long fucking longer than I would've thought. Yeah, definitely. I guess it is like a hundred UFC is later. Yeah. Wow. So seven years later he wins the title crazy. You're a look. There's going to be the same card on the same card. Right? You good? Look, there's gonna be some ups and downs. Your retina is going to get all types of fucked up, but you will be champion one day and no one takes that away from him ever. Could you imagine if him and Henderson had a rematch for the title?

Speaker 2:          01:09:53       Good Lord. Can that be made? I wonder if that could be made ethically because if you look at all the other contenders, all the people waiting in line, Chris White, Jacques Perrey, Vittorio, there's just too many. Yeah, there's too many, but two, boy, it's hard. It's a hard sell because v toward just knocked out Henderson in the first round, you know it's handled. Yeah. It's just man, vito knocked out bisping in Brazil and you're knocked out rockhold but he just got smashed by Jacques Perrey. Everything in the middleweight division is just completely up in the air and it's all, it's all turned up to that. So weird in MMA will happen. Like you're kind of like, oh okay, I think I know where everything's sounds. And then one thing changes and you're like, oh, I don't know anything. I guess you never know anything because you're only looking at the guys that are in the UFC right now and there's a whole fucking series of murders that are out there that are just getting ready to enter.

Speaker 2:          01:10:47       And there's young kids that are like 20 that are just coming into their own and in four years they might be the best fighter in the world. Yeah, there's so many of, so it's like, could the cody garb brands that are emerging, you know, they emerge then with one fight against Almeda you'd go, oh Jesus, this kid is fucking killer. And the 135 pound division and one of the top contenders now instantly. Yeah, with one standout performance, you know, and there's just good, there'll be more divisions. Like you were kind of talking about that when we were at the store the other night. Like you want to see more divisions and Emma, there'll be more divisions, more fighters I think. Right? I hope so. I hope so. There hasn't been enough progress in that. I really think that this should be a weight class every 10 pounds.

Speaker 2:          01:11:23       I really do. I think there's a lot of, there's a lot of opportunities for not just more champions, which I think is better for the sport, but guys to be able to fight in their actual weight class would be competitive. There's some gaps like 85 to two oh five man, there's a, that's a big gap. That is a giant gap, a 20 pound gap. And you know, most guys, they're probably going to be in the middle. So if you had an 85 and 95 and a two o five that's where it should be. You know? That's, I think that's, that's how boxing does. And also I think it gives you much more opportunity for you guys to fight champion versus champion, you know, and to move up or move down like fairly easily. I got, they got an 85 can move down to 75 ways or than an 85 could go up to two oh five and they could go back and forth and you could have some like really awesome a title unification bouts or you know, champion versus champion bounce.

Speaker 2:          01:12:16       Right. Yeah. No, I think I agree with that. And I like, I mean, I liked seeing the people, I like seeing the weight class. I love Khan are moving up to fight nate. I mean, although I guess you don't need more weight classes. You went up to one 70 yeah. That wasn't even a move up. That was just like it let's not cut. Yeah. Yeah. Well it wasn't move up and tell me, am I crazy about this? But why I, I've wondered this a lot and I've never really gotten a good answer on it, but why do we have the weight cuts? Like, why don't we just weigh in an hour before the event because you want to be hundred yourself before that, fine, but this dangerous guys are still going to cut weight. That's how guys die. Guys die from being dehydrated and getting hit in the head.

Speaker 2:          01:12:50       I mean you can definitely die from just getting hit in the head, but isn't it? Wouldn't it add, and maybe this is just stupid, but wouldn't it regulate itself because it's like if the APP, if the Wayans an hour before the fights and you're going to dehydrate yourself, you're going to get fucked up in the fight. Like you're not going to have time to replenish yourself, but why do this whole thing where we're weighing in and out 24 hours before guys are dehydrating themselves, then refuel it. Why not just fight the way connor, nate fought to very good point and be hydrated. It's a very good point. Another point could be to outlaw weight cutting entirely and to check people all throughout camp and to make match ups based on size. Like look at, look at two guys. You know, you say, what do you walk around that?

Speaker 2:          01:13:28       What do you walk around that? Okay, you guys will be fighting at that weight, you know, or whatever the weight is when you're in best shape. You know, if you get down to one 75 when you're in your best shape, you, you tell us what that number is, tell us what that number is. We'll match you up accordingly. And we're going to chess people's hydration levels all throughout camp. We're going to show up just like you sought it, does and test you for drugs. We're going to make you get on a scale. I'm going to test your hydration levels. And when you're at a a reasonably hydrated level where it's healthy, that's your weight, that's what you weigh now. So if you want to lose weight, you better lose weight by, you better do some extra running and you better drop some body fat, but you're not going to be dehydrated.

Speaker 2:          01:14:04       Yeah, I mean, seeing as how we can, we can figure all that stuff out. It just seems like there'd be an easier answer. Now, of course. Obviously there's, there's the commissions in the way, which I don't, I don't believe in any government regulations, so I don't think they should be there for any commission has done a fantastic job. California Commission Commissions, no joke. This guy, Andy foster who runs it, I think he runs a great organization and what he did was the opposite approach. He let them weigh in from 10:00 AM to 2:00 PM he gave him an open window. He said, look, we're going to be open. Just come down to wait. We don't want, this is what he didn't want. He doesn't want guys dehydrated standing around, weakening themselves for that one moment where they have to stand on on the scale in front of a camera.

Speaker 2:          01:14:41       He's like, this is all an artificially orchestrated event. He's like, how about this? We'll have them, they'll come in, we'll have athletic commission officers ready on standby all morning for these guys to weigh in. They come in, they weigh in. Then once we record it, make sure they're cool, they can rehydrate and they have many, many more hours to rehydrate. So guys, we're rehydrating six hours earlier. Most of the guys showed up at 10:00 AM they made weight and then they had way more time. So when you saw people stand on the scale, I was saying official weight, when I was announcing it, they had weighed in at 10 o'clock in the morning. So it was already four in the afternoon. These guys were hydrated and thick. No one looks sick. So at least visually, no one looked like, like conor mcgregor looked when he fought Chad Mendez when they weighed in and he looked like a dead man.

Speaker 2:          01:15:26       Dead man cheeks were all sucked in. It looks horrible. I mean, look, you did good in the fight. Yeah. But uh, he really did. He cuts a lot to get to one 45. He's a big boy. He's a big boy. He's way bigger than, um, like Jose Aldo and Josie all was cutting a lot at one point in his career. I, by the way, I've never, and I'm a hardcore fan, I've never enjoyed the fight more than I enjoyed nate Diaz, conor mcgregor. I was turning over lots of my mind so much. At the end of the fight. I mean, I'm like a huge Diaz Fan. Yeah. And that was just incredible. I mean, I'm 10 days notice. Yup. Well that whole um, two card or that to fight, um, event, the two fights, the final fights, the Holly Holm you should take was one of the most exciting endings to any fight ever.

Speaker 2:          01:16:04       When Misha took holly down in the fifth round a fight when she was losing it took her back and choked her. That's insane. I read an article today where someone was saying that it was, that me should loss virtually every second. It was from a guy I respect a writer and she wanted the second, I was like, what are you talking about? The second round she took her down and pounded her. I think they did they give her a 10, eight, yes. It didn't just get, and they should, she dominated. So I read this article, this is espn writer wrote it and I was like, wait a minute man. Come on. You can't say that like, why are you saying that? Like that's, that's silly hyperbole. Right. It doesn't even make any sense. Um, and me show it was threatening in the third and fourth after that holly was on her bike.

Speaker 2:          01:16:40       She was like, fuck this. Like she was fighting perfect and super cautious with no chances and barely winning those rounds, you know, just winning them but barely winning. It wasn't nothing, nothing big happened and definitely no threat. So that victory when Miesha tate choked out, holly and Holly's punching in the air, like how fucking dramatic is that going out cold punching in the air while she's going out. And then nate beating up connor and that second round after he gets fucked up in the first round, beating him up in the second round and then choking him. Yeah, insane. Probably what two, two of the most exciting finishes to any fight ever. And the, and the corner thing was just insane because he was on a tear that was like, you know, one of the biggest tears and MMA history and uh, to watch it go down like that.

Speaker 2:          01:17:22       Especially like you said, like he was winning the fight and then nate turns it around and it was almost like on a drop of a dime, like nay, nay, like came to life in that second round and starts talking shit. So it was really fun in a home for the job. Yeah, you hit him with that big one too and it was like, oh, has a snake, like one to two. He like whap and then he liked slithers around. You can't find them with the counter. He's really good. And there's no one worse than a nate or Nick Diaz to get hurt by in a fight because once they hurt you, they just like, they push a pace and then when you get hurt they like pick it up and pick it up. And then all of a sudden, I mean before you know it, conner's hit like 25 fucking times on the feet and he's shooting for a take down.

Speaker 2:          01:18:03       Those guys are always doing triathlons. So even though nate is like you're taking that fight in 11 days notice and he wasn't in shape, he's still in way better shape than most people. So like him going five rounds is not unfeasible. It's not, it's not outside of the realm of imagination. He's in shape. He's just not the kind of shape that he's going to be when they have a rematch. And that becomes a real fucking problem. Cause I think he's going to beat him up again with nate sad. He's like goes, he goes, I, if I had a camp, we wouldn't have fucking touch me. He goes, my plan was to go out slow in the first round and he came out fast enough in the first round. So I got tagged a couple times. But that's so cool. That's cool. Stick to the plan, stick to the plan.

Speaker 2:          01:18:40       And then the second round it starts loosening up and opening up and conor was just dead. Yeah. Well I heard, I mean people are talking to nate about, cause you know, going into that fight, like Connor's power was what a lot of people were talking about. Like, you know, we put one punch on Josie Aldos Chin and he's out and he's talking, he's like, they can't handle my power. I don't do courses as well. But uh, but uh, and nate was saying in one of the post fight interviews where it was like, I'm spoiling with Andre Ward and Joe Schilling and like heavyweight boxers. I'm doing rounds with heavyweight boxers. There's nothing you're going to hit him with that he hasn't seen or kind of dealt with when he's, I mean, you know, like talking like Andre Ward and Joe Schilling, like, yeah, decent strike. You're saying literally the best, the best, the best inboxing and the best of the kickboxing.

Speaker 2:          01:19:19       Well, Joe Schilling cuts wait to kickbox at 185 pounds and knocks dude's dead dead with one punch. So that guy is sparring with nate on a regular basis. Andre Ward, who is one of the best fucking boxers on the planet earth. One of the slickest said that nate gives as good as it gets when they split. Yeah, yeah, that's crazy. And I think Joe Schilling, I might be getting it, but I think Joe Schilling said he's never hurt either one of them in a sparring session. I think he said that on a fighter and the kid, ah, I believe it man. Tough fucking dudes, man. Tough fucking dudes. But what's fascinating to me is that he wanted to jump right back in there and do it again. And that nate wanted to, or that I'm connor wanted to just run it back and I was like, wow, that's interesting.

Speaker 2:          01:20:04       It seems weird that he gets to do that. Not so much that he wants to, but it just seems weird that they were like, uh, like even when Dana White was talking about in his like, look man, we tried to convince them to go down to one 45. And he was like, nate's the y'all. I was like, wait, he's the matchmaker now. He just gets to go let them. If you want, if you want to make a ton of money, right? Man, I believe in the market and that guy's, that guy's what people want to see. He can do what he can do. Whatever he wants to do, it's going to get a big pay day off it. But it's not just that the emperor has been stripped down. Okay. So now he's exposed. So now someone's beating them. So here's the thing, what do you do now?

Speaker 2:          01:20:37       You want to make money? Okay. Cause if you want to make money, you make the biggest fight you can right now while he's been exposed. And the biggest fight for sure, he said, when I say expose, I don't mean he's not talented. I mean exposed, meaning he's a human and he can lose. And that happens with every fighter they lose. And once they lose, people go, oh, you can be beat. You know, we saw it with Anderson Silva. You saw it with Mike Tyson when after Mike Tyson fight buster Douglas, who was a different world. Everybody was like, oh, he's human. So I say exposed, not in a disrespectful way, but got exposed. He lost. He got choked out and got beaten up on the ground and then he got choked out quick. So this is not an invulnerable, perfect fighter who's unbelievably durable, right? Who can take punishment like no man.

Speaker 2:          01:21:20       There's a lot of those guys in the UFC, there's champions like that in the UFC that are like Robbie lawler, unbelievably durable. You can't put him away. It's fucking hard to put that guy away. We're not talking about that. We're talking about a guy got dinged up, shot for a Shitty, wide open take down, take him down and got demolished on the ground and got choked unconscious quickly afterwards. So, all right. What do you do? Could that happen with dos Anjos fuck. Yad could dosantos could do that too. It's possible. I mean, condom might knock 'em out. You never know. Conner does have that punch, but you got to put him in against nate again because that's the big money rematch. And if, if this guy turns out to be a guy who's going to win some and lose some and the beginning of his career, this unbeatable wild Celtic warrior character.

Speaker 2:          01:22:05       Oh that's all gone. But he's champ. He's still got a belt at one 45 yeah, I'm so, it's almost kind of like a weird position for now. But I mean, here's my question. When I say for now, can you really keep banking that weight? That's what I'm saying. Well, I've wondered about that too. I've heard some people have argued with me saying like, no, he can make the weight. Cause he was, he was what it was. He one 69 against. So they're saying he basically, that's what he starts at and he can just cut down from there. That's a lot. But look what he looked like at the, at the way in. So maybe you can, I mean he kind of, he definitely can do it. It's physically possible. I was so looking forward to the press conference though, just because I can't, you know, you've got this guy in connor who's like the ultimate shit talker and then you've got nate who, I mean the first, the dynamic of the first press conference was amazing.

Speaker 2:          01:22:49       It was amazing. And at that moment when he was just like kind of talking circles around nate and they just broke and he goes, how about this? Fuck you fuck your belt. Fuck this press conference. Like they just went to gangster on them. But now like how can con I was so interested like how can he show up and talk shit like that. Yeah. When nate's got the perfect rebuttal that anything he has to say, okay John, 10 days [inaudible] st all kinds of crazy stuff. Like the first eight minutes were easy, eh? Yeah. But here's the difference between the first day I, her last three minutes, the last three were a lot worse. Yeah, they were awful. Like you got fucked up, man. Do you got to just accept that? But that's part of his thing is that he has to like look at things in the most positive light possible.

Speaker 2:          01:23:34       And Man, I don't know. Um, I think stylistically it's a troublesome fight for him because nate is a very clever boxer and his ground game is a world away from where connor is right now. And I've seen nate role with guys. He's a fucking legit, very high level Brazilian Jiu Jitsu black belt under a very respected camp. His cardio was outstanding, his boxing's nasty. So where's Connor's shining? The only way I think, I mean, I guess there's like, you know, it's, it's really hard to like fight a diaz brother and beat them. You usually when people beat them, it's kind of like they really stick to a strategy. You got to kind of take them down and avoid submissions or like leg kick and circle. I hope on Joe's beat him up in that way. But you know what, there's also different show up. Well, there's also, you know, different camps.

Speaker 2:          01:24:18       You know, you're coming in, who knows what kind of fucking injuries you're dealing with. You know, you see a guy like nate come in and look really kind of lackadaisical against, um, Hoffeld dos Anjos den. You see him come back and look shredded against Michael Johnson and looks sensational. So you go, okay, that's what he's capable of when he's on and focus, you gotta be ready for that guy. And I think that, yeah, that's the best he's ever looked at. You and Michael Johnson fight. Yeah. You can't think that the guy who lost dos Anjos is showing up. You got to think of the guy that came out and swarmed cowboy in the first round is coming. Like, that guy's a clever fucking boxer. So where does connor shine? Knock out power? That's where he shines. Like connor can dead dudes, but he couldn't do it. Yeah, they're tough to hit.

Speaker 2:          01:24:59       They have great head movement and Green Chins and they there, they roll with punches. Well, the only guy to ever stopped nate was Josh Thompson and Josh did. It was a brutal head kick. And Josh Thompson to this day, I say it's one of the most underrated guys. He just, he did the stars, did not align for him, but he could have easily been a UFC champion. He was champion a strikeforce and with Gilbert and him and Gilbert went back and forth, you know, Josh Thompson's worldclass fighters. So when Josh Thompson head kicked him, you know, it's like Josh to do that to anybody in that division and then it catches you. You know, you're fucked. He sees the older now and he's just, you know, I think he's a guy that like, like I said, the stars didn't like perfectly aligned, but like skill wise and technique wise, he's a fucking world class fighter. So when he knocked out nate Diaz, it's not necessarily an indication that nate diaz has done because just, you know, that's how good Josh Thompson is. Yeah. And at the time, and then, so nate rebounds from that. And I think people, you look at like the losses, like the Dos Anjos fight, and you look at that, the Josh Thomson fight, and you go, well, how good is he? You know, I could beat that guy. But then you look at the Michael Johnson finding

Speaker 1:          01:26:04       go, Ooh that that guy is fucking dangerous. Jim Miller. Serone exactly. Lot of these fights where he just unbelievable. Uh, and I think uh, it's, it's one of those things were styles make fights and you know, kind of really gotten people's heads by talking shit. And I felt like going in, I was like, I don't think you're going to get in nate's head by talking shit. He's not that guy. How about this? My crew will fuck up your whole crew gangster thing you could say, by the way, that's the most gangster thing cause he's literally just going, we'll fucking jump you like we're not playing around here. And all those guys, even the guys who seem like kind of Nice guys in his team, like jake shields, you feel like he'll fucking jump. You guys are fuck area and it'll kick your ass.

Speaker 2:          01:26:43       What? That's some breaking news. That's it. Since we've been going live. The first one is this UFC lifts ban and reporter Ariel Helwani. Oh the second one is a little less exciting. Wait a minute, hold on. Go back to that. It says reported that wrestler Brock Lesnar's didn't talks for attorney UFC 200 preempting a UFC announcement. Officials issued a life band against him. The organization reverse a decision Monday. That's kind of cool because that means that like public support made them lift that, but it also must mean that they worked out whatever the fuck it was. See this is what they were saying and this is, this is what I'm hearing. Okay. Let me just, I don't, I haven't talked to Ariel, but let me just give you the UFC perspective. The UFC perspective was that there was a mole. They believe that someone was giving Ariel information and that information he was using to scoop the UFC official promotions.

Speaker 2:          01:27:42       So the UFC, which is a private company, you know, they don't have to have, if you don't have to let people in to your, your business, your private companies to come and report. And so they felt like he was somehow or another getting ahold of this inside information, releasing it and making them look bad. Now I get the UFC is perspective that they would want to know who the fuck is leaking this secret information and that they don't, they don't want this guy taking that information and then putting it live. Now, from what I understand, the conversation with him was, don't do this because if you do this, there's only a handful of people that know this information. So we're going to fire everybody or we're going to fire a bunch of people and you're gonna ruin people's lives. This is what I was told.

Speaker 2:          01:28:24       It was a conversation they had with him after that conversation. He leaked the brock lesnar stuff so that, I don't know if that's true. I would have to talk to Arielle. You'd have to get his opinion. You'd have to get the UFC as opinion. You'd have to get the two of them together to debate whether or not which story was true. But this is the side that you're not hearing. So all you're hearing is the UFC banned him for life and everybody was upset. So I like Ariel. I think errol is a very good reporter. I think he's a very bright guy. I'm good friends with his uncle Gad sad, who's a, a full disclosure. Awesome. Uh, just a brilliant, brilliant professor in Montreal. I love that guy. So I like Ariel and I, the whole thing was bumming me out. I was looking at my twitter feed.

Speaker 2:          01:29:07       I was like, oh fucking. But th there's certain things like this. You got to kind of let the dust settle. So the dust settled, they lifted the ban. I'm very happy with that. But you gotta be careful when it comes to see. Here's the thing about this leaking information. People say it was just doing his job reporting. I get that. I understand that. But you have to realize this isn't like news that is not going to get out. That's going to affect people's health. We're trying to make an announcement. This is a private company that is spending millions of dollars to promote these events. So all you're doing is just like getting it on you. You're taking the gun right out that door and to the right hand side, all you're doing, if you're, if you're scooping it, is you're shining the attention on yourself. What I'd like Ariel for is not him shine the attention on himself.

Speaker 2:          01:29:56       What I like aerial fours. I think he's a very bright guy and I think he's very insightful when it comes to fights and strategies and things along those lines, so I don't think it's important that he break the news before the UFC does and I think if the UFC doesn't want him to do that because this is private information in a private company and they're trying to control the press release, I don't buy that. That's necessarily like under the guise of journalism. I think it's like there's some, there's some fuckery with that because we're not talking about like, oh he, he found out about some horrible thing that happened that someone's covering up or he found out about corruption in government or he found out about a person got shot by the police. This isn't, this is not like that kind of news. This is, they're going to release it.

Speaker 2:          01:30:41       It's going to, you're just trying to do it before they do it and you're finding it. If it's true that there's a mole, you're finding it out through some sort of a sneaky method that these people all sign nondisclosure agreements and they're all not supposed to release that information because the UFC wanted to make that big cool announcement. Now when that big cool announcement happened at UFC one 99 I was working all day. I was doing commentary all day, so I didn't go online and I wasn't reading any of the MMA sites, so I didn't know that Ariel had already scooped it. So when I saw that Promo and I saw brock Lesnar, can you see me? Oh, I was like, what does that mean? Was this real? Like what? Like that was a real reaction by me. I had no fucking idea whatsoever that brock lesnar was going to be at UFC 200 I didn't either.

Speaker 2:          01:31:26       No one around me knew what was happening. We didn't see the promo right in here. That's what the UFC wanted. They wanted that and they felt like him releasing that early ruin that for the people that read his article and I see their point of view, I see their perspective and I also see their perspective as a private company. Now people are saying that he's just doing his job and it's just journalism folks. This, this is not hidden information. This is not stuff that wasn't going to come out for sure in a couple of hours. He knew it was, everybody knew it was. So this is a very tricky thing and it's also, he had apparently scooped nate diaz versus conor Mcgregor. He had done that and that was when, this is again what I'm hearing. When they had a talk with them they'll like, look, if you fucking do this, you're going to ruin people's lives because you're going to get people fired because we're going to find out who the fuck did this.

Speaker 2:          01:32:15       There's only a small handful of people. It's not coming from brock side. It's coming somehow or another from inside the organization. So yeah, I don't got no, I got no problem with the UFC doing it. Cause, I mean if everything we're saying, you know, cause obviously I don't know all the information, but look, it's your company, it's your information. Yes, you have a right to tell your employees, don't give this out. And if there's evidence that one of them is what I'm gonna fire that guy. Yeah. And this is, this is the most important part of it folks. This is not a free speech thing is not a freedom of the press thing. Cause we're not saying that he somehow or another scoop, some inside information that we'd have never gotten out is his, is not some secret stuff. She has the right to say it.

Speaker 2:          01:32:53       Yeah. No, you shouldn't be thrown in jail. Um, I don't have a kit for anyone being thrown in the towel, but I'm saying what I'm saying is it's not like he unveiled, he uncovered some inside shit like Watergate. This was something that they were going to have release. They had a plan and he got word of that and jump the gun and put it out there. And he said he had multiple sources and all this different jazz. But look, it doesn't help anybody to release it early except Ariel, she's saying it's not like he found out about some scandal going on and he was showing to the public, that's what we like. We want to drop this in an act. And by the way, I didn't read his thing and I loved finding that news out live at the event. It was amazing. Well, and I look, I don't give a fuck.

Speaker 2:          01:33:35       Okay. I don't, I mean I think it's Kinda cool that they had that, but it doesn't bother me at all that the information got out a few hours earlier would I've had the same reaction. No, but if I saw it in written word, I was still at a very similar reaction. Like what the fuck? I wouldn't have had the same reaction when I saw the promo, but come on, man, I'm not into cheesy promos anyway. I don't give a fuck. I want to see matchups. I don't give a shit. Give everybody the information. The moment it happens. I don't give a fuck. I don't like announcements, all of that. I don't. But that said, I completely understand the UFC, his opinion or the UFC position where they have this company and you know, people go, Oh, you're a company man, you're fucking sticking up for the company. No, just think about this for a second.

Speaker 2:          01:34:18       You have a promotional campaign that you've created. You've spent more than a million dollars promoting this UFC 200 commercial. They have this whole thing and then they tag brock Lesnar in the end and they think, oh my God, this is the fucking cherry on top of the Sundae. This is going to be it. And then someone jumps the gun and you find out that it's someone inside your company, allegedly that's leaking information. This reporter and he's getting this information out and always doing is essentially scooping it and putting the onus and the putting the light on himself. No, I think you have every right to want to fire that person. Yeah. And also every right till it's a bad area. And I love area I think is a great reporter. I, you know like watching his stuff. I liked the MMA hour long. Again, maybe that information that I got from the UFC is also incorrect and maybe that's why his ban has been lifted.

Speaker 2:          01:35:07       But look, no one wants a guy like Ariel Helwani to not have a Gig. And I think him getting banned. Honestly, if you're an Ariel Helwani fan, you should be jumping up and down for two reasons why you should be happy that he got banned because then it makes them like a martyr and then happy that he got reinstated because now he's a hero. So I'm an Ariel Helwani Fan, so I'm happy. I'm obviously a UFC fan, so I'm happy. I'm glad they worked it out. And everybody talk and get to watch a, we get to watch brock lesnar fight. Exactly. But it's these everybody that's freaking out that he's only doing his job. That's not necessarily true folks. It's, it's a little bit more complicated than that because it's not like that information wasn't already coming out. And if you have information that you know is going to come out, right.

Speaker 2:          01:35:53       A fucking story about what that information means. Cause that's what I want at Ariel Helwani. I think Eric [inaudible], he's a really smart guy and he's really insightful and he's a true mma fan and he's a guy that is going to give you some really good insight and some very, very well articulated thoughts that I enjoy. So I'm happy, I'm happy he's back, I'm happy. But that is the perspective that when I found out about it, I had to ask. I called and I had this conversation with people that I deeply trust and this was the version that I was handed. So now everybody knows and it's so groovy. So the conspiracy theories can say he's working with the UFC. I'm a puppet. But I mean look, obviously I love the UFC and obviously Dana white is a very good friend of mine, so you're not going to hear me criticize them.

Speaker 2:          01:36:41       You know what I mean? If I, if I disagree with them, you're like, he's my friend. So it makes sense. That's how human interactions work. He's like a friend and by the end he's created an amazing company. He's the, he's the reason why this sport is out there and you guys have worked together for. So even if you had a falling out and you were like, I don't want to work there anymore, why would you go publicly? He would never hear that from me and I would never work for anybody else either. I both said like if you leave the UFC or you're like, what are you going to do? He worked for bell tour. I'm like, I'm not working for anybody. If I don't work for the UFC, I am never doing this again. Yeah, I couldn't see you commentating for another MMA blocking the chance.

Speaker 2:          01:37:14       No chance, no chance. It's not even on the table. It's not going to happen. I would just won't do it anymore. I mean I would be happy to just go back to doing stand up. Um, I like being a fan and honestly, my favorite thing to do, I don't, I love calling fights. Don't get me wrong. It's an amazing job of how to for a long time. But fight companions are even more fun, right? Like companion podcast when it's Eddie Bravo and shop and Callan and was hanging out and watch, oh my God. And we drank and eat food and talk shit and have a fights. Boring. Someone tells us a story about, you know, getting laid or shitting their pants and traffic or, I mean, it's hilarious. The most fun. It's the best because we get, look, the best seat in the house is kind of their live where I sit.

Speaker 2:          01:37:58       So I do kind of have the best seat in the house. But honestly watching it on TV might be the best seat in the house because you don't get the obstruction of the cage. I've been, well look, I don't like the UFC is, I've been to, I don't have like the great fucking seats either. I've sat and just, and I've caught myself sitting there where you're watching now buddy. Ooh, life is changing you up. Uh, but I, I've been sit there where I'm looking, I'm catching myself just watching the screen of course. Big screen a lot and you're kind of, you are aware of that or you're just like, I'm really not even watching this live. Half the time, you know they start fighting over here and you're like, I have now the octagon is blocking man. You don't get the commentary unless you have one of those ear piece things that they sell.

Speaker 2:          01:38:35       So like sometimes something's going on and you're like, what is happening? Why is the doctor, and they're like, what's going on? Why is he sitting on the stool? Why is he on the ground? Like what the fuck is going on? And it'll take you like 10 minutes of frustration to try to decipher. And then like bruce buffer has to announce it due to an injury. But speaking of that, you get to see the bruce buffer three 60 every time, which he doesn't do a three 60 it was a one 81, three 60 and that's at UFC 200 which ladies and gentlemen begs the question, should we convince Bruce buffer to do something else? Seven uh, seven 20 do we convince them to do a seven 20? You heard it right here, but he's getting up there in age. I don't want him to blow out an acl.

Speaker 2:          01:39:15       He blew, blew his acl out doing the jump. You know he does that thing where he like he blew his acl doing acl out doing which in that which fight? I don't remember. He probably tell me if I asked him. He he might not even my, I'm sure he remembers, but here we could watch the three 60 by the way, this three 60 is 100% my idea, I talked him into it. There's any even a video of me talking him into the three 60 and I'm like, cause he only did the one 80 and he did the wine 80 because he accidentally, it was pointing towards the wrong side once and he realized that there's another one dude, hold up, bring this to the beginning, bring it to the beginning and then crank it up real loud so we can hear it. You'd do it. Bring it from the beginning. Put it in the beginning. Britain in the beginning. There you go. My main goal this weekend besides having fun and getting to see some awesome fights. It's talking Bruce Buffer.

Speaker 4:          01:40:17       It's the buffer three 63 60 we planted the seed in his head, shit, it was about a year ago. Talked to him about possibly going from a one 82 or three 60 could he do it? But that crazy mother fucker went home and actually practiced it. [inaudible] work on them at the [inaudible] for three 60 brought to you by the power of marijuana. So this is the UFC. What proof? UFC 100 today's that day, will we see the buffer? Three is still stands that I will know at that exact millisecond of the moment I decided to do it. Do I want to do it? Yes I do. But let's see how the energy feels unless say, oh, I feel and let's see how the show goes. If I can do it, I'll pull it off. Like fucking take it. Joey Diaz is sitting there right behind me while it happened. I forgot that until he was right there. Oh, this is the biggest ever UFC pay per view. And that's me with a video camera on Mike Goldberg hoping that he's going to do the one 83 60 while look how lean frank Mir looked at the time. We look great now get ready for this. Like he's going to do it. He's going to do it. I was like, he's not going to do it. That's,

Speaker 3:          01:42:58       I was so happy. So there's Red Band Diaz and Ari fear. Wow. Everybody looks so young. Wow. It's crazy. That was seven years ago. That doesn't seem like seven years ago. Somehow already had an older haircut at the time while he was gone for the mustache. Look at the time and he had a lot of craziness going on. Wow. That's a long ass time ago. That's crazy. Who? Who is it? Who has that up? Does that red bands page? Wow. I should put it on my channel. So we have to figure out a way to make a seven 20 plausible to spend. He needs a hover board or something. So the other breaking news you just handed me, is it Kimbo slice died, died. I think he was admitted to the hospital with a heart condition today or maybe Thursday the other day.

Speaker 5:          01:43:52       And News is breaking just as we were coming on when people are trying to get confirmation on that, if he actually passed and tweeted it,

Speaker 2:          01:43:59       oh the American top team tweeted that he died. He must have really died. Wow. He was a good guy, man. I met that dude a couple of times. Very nice guy. Fuck man. Crazy story. He had man just fuck Internet street fights into the UFC. Well first into the CBS thing. It was a good boxer. You know, he's a good boxer in the early days of a mma, you know, he go back and watch like Kimbo slice Kayo and lead x c just to lead, see fucked up and trying to put all their eggs in one basket and have this guy who was this internet sensation be their figurehead. I mean it made sense like financially, but the people in the know like me, I was like, listen, if he fights someone good, he's going to get fucked up. Like I see all these holes in what he does.

Speaker 2:          01:44:46       And it was frustrating as a hardcore fan because it was still at a point like the UFC is much, much bigger now. I remember when they got that fight on uh, on CBS, like mma had never been on a big network like that before. So it was very frustrating that the biggest network was putting it out as if this guy was the best guy in mma. And you know, us like hardcore fans like me and my friends would be around bitching. Like Randy Guitar would take them down in a second. But he was fun to watch. Well people forget that elite Xc sorta had the scoop on the UFC. They had the scoop on getting on broadcast television and they had millions of people watching those fights. Didn't UFC like why aren't they in talks with HBO? And then it like fell apart and then elite xc ended up getting the deal with showtime or whatever was one of the problems hbo wanted to replace me and Goldberg and put in their own commentators.

Speaker 2:          01:45:37       They wanted to do their own version of the broadcast because they probably felt like us as you have seen, employees would be biased. And the UFC was like, that's not gonna happen. Like first of all, who are you going to get? Like how many people are out there? Especially at the time that even do commentary. This is a small handful of people in the world that are qualified to do mma commentary at a top level. It was a big problem. Big, big problem with other organizations. We've been made them almost unwatchable because the announcing would just be so terrible. I mean like nowadays I feel like there was a while where I thought you and Goldberg, we're like the only team who can do mma without me just wanting to mute it. Um, but I actually like now they've got the alternate teams have gotten fairly strong.

Speaker 2:          01:46:19       Like Brian stands. Really good price hands. Excellent. Dan. Hardee's excellent and hard. He's really good. Yeah, there's a lot of people that can do my job now. But back then there was a small handful. And by the way, the, the, a lot of people that can do my, other than Jimmy Smith who's really good, who, uh, works for Beltour, Jimmy Smits excellent. He's, he's as good as me. Easy. He's as good as anybody. He's, he's, he's fantastic. He knows his shit. He's a real fan. He's a smart guy. He's, he's easy to listen to. He calls things. Right. I'm a big Jimmy Smith Fan. But um, other than outside of the UFC, who do you got outside? The UFC does not, not really much unless there's some unknown gods I don't know of, which is definitely possible. But there's, in the UFC, there's several guys now, you know, you got Kenny Florian, you got Brian Stand, you've got Dan Hardee, there's plenty of people can do it now, but they worked for the UFC.

Speaker 2:          01:47:06       So someone like hbo wanted to have their own team. You can't just get sports guys. You just can't do that because they're not going to understand what the fuck's going on when the fight goes to the ground and they're going to miss things. And it's going to be sloppy. You can't have that. You'd have to have someone who understands and you have to have someone who can talk. Like when you watch old school a mma, it's one of the craziest things about better that it's being announced by people who don't understand the sport. So you literally hear them saying things like, why is he typing? Yeah. Yeah, you get, you definitely get a lot of that. And we'll usually get a lot of that from a judges, which is really crazy. I have a friend of mine is a friend of mine who's a judge and in the middle of a fight, this woman, uh, who was also a judge looked over them and go, she goes, what is he doing that someone had someone in a Kamora and she's like, what is he doing?

Speaker 2:          01:47:48       What's going on over there? Like she's a professional judge at the highest level in the UFC. And she had no, and this was four years ago, five years ago. So yeah, but this is what I'm against. All those commissions. Well, yes and no. You definitely need commissions cause if you don't have commissions and you don't have medical staff on team, you don't have like strict standards as far as you know, you have to have some government it especially with something like combat sports because there's too many fly by the seat of your pants. Organizations that don't do medical screenings, people could die. I mean they test. You have to have like uh, certainly the companies would have to be held responsible for that stuff. Yeah. But you can't just leave it up to the companies. We can, the athletes that suffer if there's no medical coverage, the right there, you can't have an event like an mma event where you putting your literally your health and your life in the hands of these people that are supposed to have all their ducks in a row so they can run this event and measure whether or not you even get paid is in question Si.

Speaker 2:          01:48:43       Because these guys don't have any power. The fighters, you know, there's, there's, they don't have enough influence, especially on a small local level, small shows. So I'm a big fan of how California does it. Like I said, I'm a big fan of that Andy Foster guy. I think he's, he's fucking, he's as good as it gets when it comes to heads of athletic commissions. But I think that you have to have a bond where you have the money to pay the fighters before he can put on an event. And that should be mandatory because you've done, have you ever done shows? We haven't gotten paid. Yeah, I have. It's fucking horrible, man. It's, that's not frustrating. Especially when you know that you, there was an audience there and they laughed. So Pete, there's money exchanged, but where's my money? Oh please. You don't have it. You don't even have a show if you don't have the show.

Speaker 2:          01:49:24       Part of the show I had, I had one where I had to fly myself out to it. I didn't get paid and like there were people there. The club was the ohs. Brutal. It was brutal. Did you ever get paid? No. Never. Never. To this day there's a Gig Mianna man. Big J. No, some. We're both on the GIG together. Both of us didn't get paid. I was opening for him. This is years ago. I both like I was opening for him, but believe me it probably hurt me more of the money. Uh, I mean, uh, made it on money, but at the moment I was like fucking broke. Um, but I will say then you also deal with a lot of other shit when you get these government regulatory bodies like with the Vegas. Was it the Vegas Commission that had Nick Diaz? Of course, which I mean has there ever, if you, the guy moved up a weight class and thought the greatest of all time at that weight class who tested positive for steroids and they found that he was, had trace amounts of thc in the system and he passed a couple of tests, right?

Speaker 2:          01:50:18       He pass the most stringent tests available. You pass to Wada test to world anti-doping agency tests. There were blood tests, there are much more particular and then he failed a urine test that the Nevada state athletic commission. But he says it's bullshit and like the Wata people say it's bullshit. The water. People were like, look like there's no fee. And then they wouldn't test sample b. There was like some, some issues with testing of sample B or allowing the tests of sample b and they banned, they tried to ban him for five years. I gave out the Nevada state athletic commission, his phone number, I put it on twitter, it's on everybody calm. They were fucking best there are pissed off. I was like, fuck you. What would they were like petitions online and stuff like that. People would be fired and then they should be locked in jail.

Speaker 2:          01:51:03       Yeah, the amount of incompetence and you have to have to think that you're going to take away a guy's athletic career for trace amounts of marijuana and the system and not examine the to Wada test that showed that he was clean. Oh, it's just so disgusting. And this guy, this guy who, you know, Nick Diaz was like, came from nothing and like made a career of it. Was, was like doing something positive with his life. Ruined him. It's just pot. He fought a guy on steroids. Yes, exactly. And it's just the greatest ever on roids. Yeah, you should just, you should, you should say, I'm so sorry that we let a guy on steroids fight against you. Here's some more pot. Exactly. He's don't sue us. Exactly. I mean, the idea that you can just go in there and run an organization like that and tell those people that are fighting that their futures fuck like what they did to vandelay Silva is arguably even more disgusting.

Speaker 2:          01:51:56       Vandelay Silva ran away from a drug test. Okay. Not Good. Definitely shouldn't do that. But they banned him for life. He's never tested positive. Ever. Ever abandoned for life gets, it's insane. That's beyond fuck debts. Tyranny. Well, it's this guy, uh, this the guy, the cops killed in Baltimore, that Guy Freddie Gray. Like essentially what he did was he ran, they didn't have anything on him. They weren't there to arrest him. He saw cops and ran. And it's like a weird dynamic where you're like running, it may be a little suspicious, but it's not itself a crime. Right, right. Like how can there be such a hard punishment for running? Yeah. You're just, I mean it just seems strange, which was a woman. The Guy ran away and they shot him then through a Taser on the ground. That was no different line. That was in North Carolina. And I think there was a little bit more maybe, maybe you're right. Maybe it was one of those, I was wanting to go to South Carolina

Speaker 1:          01:52:46       because I'm from the north, we to say, oh South Carolina ones that are all fucked up. The North Carolina, North Carolina would never, never, but then it, it did turn out that he was like, he had the cops Taser or something like that. Right. And that and that one, all the cop through the Taser on the ground. Is that what it was? I don't remember the story exactly. There's a video of the cop chucking the Taser on the ground after he shot him. Like, cause if set up caught him, he had a weapon, you know? Yeah. Like what, a lot of shady shit. There's something about that balance too of where like if you, if a cop is, it is, you know, if a cop grabs your arm and you yank it away, so you're like, assault resisting arrest Jerry, you're, you're fucked now. But the cops can like beat a dude with a nightstick half to death and then they're like, well, we thought he might've been going for someone's gun.

Speaker 1:          01:53:33       Yeah, yeah. It's dark man. It's, it's, and also cops just like everything else we're talking about in government, they're people and they vary and there's going to be people that are awesome cops. And I personally think that it's one of the most difficult jobs a person can do. And psychologically the, the idea of going to work every day where all the people you deal with are going to be lying to you and up to something and hate you. Well, did you, did you follow it all? What happened? Um, was like a, I guess a year and a half ago now in, in New York where the NYP D had like a, essentially a quasi shutdown. Yes. I mean it's, it's, and I think what you're saying is absolutely true. I mean, I think it's an incredibly difficult job. And, and a lot of that is because of the rules we have, which are kind of crazy.

Speaker 1:          01:54:12       I mean, the idea of having to police drug use. Yeah. It's a very difficult position to put someone in because the, I mean, obviously first and foremost, it's a horrible thing to do to throw someone in a cage for putting something into their body. But it's a very weird thing when there's no complaintant. It's two people who are making a voluntary transaction and now you got to go in like Swat raid and find them at, this guy's giving a bag of something to another person. Go get them. But, so for people who don't know, there was after that, Eric Gardner Guy, uh, got choked out and choked to death in a, I don't know how you'd put it, but he got, he got choked to death. I'm sorry, I shouldn't say that. We had like a heart attack. He had a heart attack while getting tackled down.

Speaker 1:          01:54:51       A legendary selling loosies loose cigarettes. Uh, nothing. So there were a bunch of protests and then a couple, uh, two cops got shot in Brooklyn, uh, by some maniac. Yeah, I think it was [inaudible] and he drove up, he tweeted he was going to do it and then drove up and shot two cops who never saw it coming. It's poor guys got killed on the job. Um, and then as a result of that, they had like an official unofficial what they called an Nyp d slow down. And I'm one of the, it was a spokesman for the police union, he said, and I believe it was the New York Post, he said, uh, as a result of the shooting, the cops will only be making arrests when absolutely necessary. Well, that's what he said, which was weird. Like shouldn't they always be doing that? But anyway, so they, but uh, arrest went down like 80%, uh, or at least it was maybe like 60% and 66 cents we have here.

Speaker 1:          01:55:46       And then it was like nonviolent tickets and bullshit arrest. We're down like 90%. Like they were just basically not doing that anymore. And there was this beautiful like month and a half long period where the NYP d just wasn't doing what they do. They weren't over policing everybody and then they started cracking the whip to get them to go back to do it because evidently a lot of money is raised by these, you know, that's the issue. Glorified revenue collectors. There's a lot of revenue that gets gathered up in kind of fucking devious ways. Like I've always been disgusted by parking tickets. Like why the city owns the fucking spot where you can leave a car and you have to give them money to leave a car and that's how they gather up millions of dollars and they become addicted to that gathering of the millions of dollars. Right. That's fucking crazy.

Speaker 1:          01:56:35       You can't do that, man. You can't. You can't. Oh, it's a horrible way to fund a system. Imagine, by the way, just being that guy, you just being the guy who's going out, just giving tickets. Like you just go around ruining people's Day, like all day long line. My friend Brian used to do that. That must be a fucking weird bad for your brain. I'd imagine it has to be. I mean, I imagine some of these people, men who are like literally, you know, working, uh, like you know, lower class jobs and have families to pay for and you're just going to go hand them a fucking hundred dollar ticket because the meter expired by two minutes. He didn't give us enough money and it's just changing as laundry or something and you know, let it go for a few minutes. Yeah, I mean I get the idea that you, you shouldn't have cars that are blocking the street.

Speaker 1:          01:57:18       You should definitely give people tickets if they're doing something that has trucks at or tow them. But to just leave a car on the street, you have to pay money. Yeah. I mean, look, I have, I have a problem with the way government raises almost all revenue. I mean I just, I reject the whole system of, of like taxation at the threat of violence. I think it's like primitive and barbaric. And when, when human beings look back on that it's going to be the way we look back at like slavery or arranged marriage or whatever it is that the idea that the way we fund our organization, you know, like, like let's say there are these services that are necessary. So the way we fund that as we go, uh, you have to pay a portion of your income or we'll fucking throw you in jail.

Speaker 1:          01:57:57       Yeah, we'll put you in a cage, block you in a cage like an animal. They're just like, that's the biggest thing. Um, when I'm arguing that with people about like libertarianism versus other ways that we should organize society as my biggest thing that I just, I, I harp on is just a like, okay, who should we throw in a cage? Who was it morally acceptable to throw into a cage forcefully? Like send men with guns to get them and throw them into a cage. Like I'll grant you a murderer, a rapist, someone who assault somebody. Okay. Yeah. Maybe we go into like theft, things like that. Cause cause that is a violation of, you know, you own yourself and then you own your, your possession. So that's a violation. But are you, are you really okay if someone's like, oh I don't want to fund that program.

Speaker 1:          01:58:39       I won't like I won't my money and to fund the war cause I don't believe in the war. So now we can throw that guy in a cage. Yeah. Or I don't want to, I don't want to fund them. Look, even if you have a really noble charity, why should you be able to threaten violence against someone to get them to fund it? Well, that's where I like Gary Johnson, Gary Johnson steps in and says we don't need the irs. It's like, let's listen. We don't need, that's not how we have to make money, which put taxes on consumption. I, I like Gary Johnson. I wish he would be a little more Ron Paul. But uh, he's away. I just feel like Gary Johnson has this way of selling the libertarianism as this kind of like, well, you know, it's more practical if we do it the libertarian way. Huh.

Speaker 1:          01:59:24       Whereas I like when he's asked about the wars, he'll say, he'll say things like, um, he goes, well, I think if you look on average these military interventions of hurt more than they have helped. That is exactly how we sound. That's a really good impression. Yeah, I watched a lot of them. Well, so my only, by the way, that's not necessarily incorrect. It's just like who, who would talk about mass murder that way and it's like, it's like talking about slavery and you're like, well, I just think overall this is an inefficient way to get cotton Jesus dude. Like and your, your head abolitionist really, you're supposed to represent the abolitionist movement, right? With that, that attitude. So he's like a moderate radical. Yeah, he's just a pragmatist man. He's just like this. This makes more sense, which is just fine. But I don't really want to sell.

Speaker 1:          02:00:15       Libertarianism is like, I think we're fiscally conservative and socially liberal. He's like a, he's a bridge because he was a lifelong Republican. Like he's a good bridge to getting people to consider an alternative party and maybe one of the only ones it's currently available. See I believe in a little bit more like a case for radicalism. I think that, um, so Ron Paul, when he was in the 2007, 2008 debates, she got a whole lot of people interested in libertarianism and he didn't do it by being like a bridge to like, before I tell you, you know, slavery is horribly immoral. Let me first convince you it's inefficient and ineffective. And then he went right to like, this is wrong, this is wrong. We're killing people in countries around the world. Like this is morally horrible. And he got a movement going when he was in those debates.

Speaker 1:          02:01:03       You know, Gary Johnson was in one of the major debates in 2012. Do you remember anything from his performance because nobody ever does? No. Nobody ever does because he'll go in there and say things like, in New Mexico, I was able to balance the budget was earning 7% and you're like, ah, you have the greatest, the greatest political philosophy ever devised by man behind you libertarians. You have the answer to all this shit. You're the abolitionists in slavery times. And so you really feel libertarianism is the answer to everything? Well, no, no, no. It's not in the same way that abolition isn't the answer to everything during slavery. It's the first moral step to then we can live in. What about libertarianism is so attractive to you? Uh, I mean, I just, the, I think it's philosophically sound and it's, it's basically just a, to me it's, it's a humble understanding of what existence is.

Speaker 1:          02:02:00       That we don't really know what this is. Man's kind of born into the world naked and we're here with nature and we're all trying to figure it out and that morally speaking, we should all own our own lives and therefore own your own body and that, and basically it all centers around property rights and the nonaggression principle, which is just the idea that you should never initiate violence against the nonviolent person. And then you just draw conclusions from that. Well, those are all really standard, um, points in libertarianism to get brought up all the time. But why is it that libertarianism, even though it's so attractive to like young, intelligent guys like you, why is it that that has never caught hold in a mainstream way as an alternative third party? Because it really the, you've had like, people like that run his independence that get a little bit of momentum, but it's always, people always look at it like, well, that's never going to work out.

Speaker 1:          02:02:49       He's never really going to get there. You, you, you know, vote for Hillary because she has a chance. You know what I mean? You get those. Yeah. Well I think there's a game and there's, you know, it's, it's, um, there's like the government is a power center and it's in their interest to continue having power. And I think usually most people are much more, if they get close to that power, they're much more incentivized to try to expand it and try to keep it than to at any point, say you guys, you know, it'd be a lot more moral if we, uh, we didn't have this. And you know, I mean, it's like, why did slavery persist for so long? Because you know it's a, it's a good way to get cotton without having to work. Yeah. Yeah. I mean people are getting rich off this thing and they certainly are, but I do.

Speaker 1:          02:03:31       I will. I wonder how much time it has left like this. This, it seems like it's a reoccurring, reoccurring theme that comes up over and over again when people talk about the problems that we have with a running society, we were currently doing it. He said this two party system is just so preposterous. It's so ridiculous to say that you have these two groups and they're both funded by the same people, the competing against each other allegedly, but yet nothing changes. And that this is the system and this is the only way to do it. Like, well, how can we count? We've got a hundred different systems and ideas and what does this grand old party, what's the idea of there being a leader for 320 million people? I mean, none of it makes any sense at all. Just be in an elephant she wants. It's all still so weird how there's this big, like this big show about how much they hate each other, but then they just come together over the most important issues feel betrayed.

Speaker 1:          02:04:23       When I see like Clinton laughing it up with Bush, I'm like, what the fuck are you guys laughing about? How many people died when you were in office? Right. And how the media is angle on it will and you know, it'd be msnbc or Fox News who was supposedly hate each other. But when you see all the presidents together, they're all kind of celebrating it. They're like, it's nice that we could all come together and have this, this toast. Like what? What is this? I thought it was so you're all full of Shit and how is it that you know you have these things were so, so the Republicans hate Obama. Obama hates the Republicans. They both think the other ones, the reason why the country's falling apart. But then when like, you know, something like the NDA bill where he says he can arrest American citizens with no charges and hold them indefinitely, we all just get together and sign that, you know, that's fine.

Speaker 1:          02:05:03       And the media, it's not even like that big of a deal. Like they just passed a law that said they can arrest you with that. Like we just over the whole idea that you have rights, we just overthrew that in one in one bill. And uh, but you know, that'll get like a mention here that you have to understand that that won't be used. Don't worry about it. That's all for terrorist. That's my favorite. Obama actually, he put in a signing statement when he signed it into law, he said, and I guess this was to like appease the, the liberal activists who may be, would be a little upset with him, but he said, my administration has no plans of detaining American citizens, but we want to let you know that we read your emails. Fuck with us. We'll see you in a hard, yeah.

Speaker 1:          02:05:42       So who's okay with that? Which is frustrating for everybody that nothing changes in that this two party system was in place when we were kids. It's, it's in place now and it's quite possibly it will be in place 50 years from now when we were dead. I don't know. I do think something is changing in this election cycle and I don't, I don't know that it's purely a positive force but there's definitely something going on. I mean if you look at what's what's going on with trump and I'm no fan but it is a, it is a moment. Yeah. Trump is having a real moment and he is kind of tearing down this matrix and a and and Bernie also had an interesting moment. It's, it's very interesting that they always, the powers that be kind of decide who these people are going to be and it does seem like this year people are really rejecting that on a very grassroots level.

Speaker 1:          02:06:31       Like, no, we don't buy this bullshit. I wonder how much longer they can keep it up. Well there's no real candidates. That's the problem. I said you're dealing with scrubs. It's like this minor league ball team that wants to play in the superbowl because there's some sort of a strike amongst really good players. It really seems like that. I mean come on man, you're telling me that Donald Trump is the best we can do or Hillary Clinton. I mean, how many of you just as Comedians, like how many like charismatic, just interesting people like do you know show you do, it's so many different like really smart, interesting people. You sit there like you're telling me we can't find one who won. But I think like you said before, the real problem is that a good person or any type of honest person would right away go, no, I can't rule 320 million people.

Speaker 1:          02:07:18       Not only that, you would never get to that position because you would be compromised every step of the way and then you'd become what they are. The only, I mean it's a really rig game and it's rigged through lobbyists and special interest groups and money and campaign funds. By the time you get to that position unless you're a Bernie Sanders or Donald Trump. And that's what makes it interesting because they're the only two people that represents two completely new paradigms. You have Bernie who is this weird socialist type character, democratic socialist character. And then you have trump who's like the ultimate capitalist. And both people represent entirely new groups because Donald Trump is essentially at least partially self funded. And you know, now he's trying to get money and there's, well he's already the nominee though. I mean he's, he's cemented. So it's a, it's an interesting position where it's going to get some support.

Speaker 1:          02:08:07       Yes. But so far, basically trump and sanders both found a way to do it without taking corporate money. Trump found a way to speak over the media and get the media to keep him in there 24 hour news cycle and Apulia this shit out of everybody. But they're both, I mean, I got to say they're not, I don't look at, while they're personalities are very different. I don't know if anything about their policy, the policies are actually like diametrically opposed. I think they're both kind of populists in a lot of ways. Like Bernie Sanders has more of a re as more of an ideology, like this is my philosophy on what government should do. And trump's just kinda like, well, well let's let it rip. But they're both kind of like, let me tell you what you want to hear to the crowd. Well, trump is a carnival barker and you know, he talks about that in the art of the deal.

Speaker 1:          02:08:48       I mean, his, his whole style of campaigning is, is all mapped out in his books where he talks about this larger than life persona that he's created in order to make himself a public figure in order to make himself more wealthy, more popular, and more able to get things done. I mean, this is like a strategy, this, this whole thing that he's doing like, and I called them, we're going to make that wall 10 feet higher. Like that's all like Carnival Barker Shit. But it's amazing that he, he's stepped into the game of politics and almost ripped it open from the inside where he's like, I'm just talking like a dude. Yeah, I'm not even doing it. And I don't know how Hilary Clinton's going to handle this guy. Well how about when he was talking about how big his Dick is? Well he to be fair, he just said there's no problem.

Speaker 1:          02:09:34       No look, it's amazing. He was insinuating there's someone was insinuate entity had small hands way a small penis. And I just said I want to let you know there's no problems there. He made a, I have a big Dick. So here's what happens. Right? This guy, this was like I think a couple of decades ago. Okay. There's this guy who worked for vanity fair and he wrote something about trump having small hands and trump sent him a picture like head shots of his hands and a note being like, I don't have small hands. Like he actually responded to them and this was out there. Like I heard some people talk about this. So Marco Rubio knew if he went at his hands just to makes sense. Cause his hands aren't small. No, but for whatever reason he said something. He goes, he, Marco Rubio said he's got small hands and you know what they say about guys with small hands and this is the maniac that is Donald Trump.

Speaker 1:          02:10:22       She couldn't not bring that up. So the next debate he goes, uh, he goes, and by the way, she said, I have small hands. I look at these hands. That pretty good. Am I right? And just so you know, he couldn't stop. There she goes. And just so you know, he implied that because of these small hands, that means something else is small and I promise you there's no problem there. Yeah, it was very bizarre. I mean, strange. His fingers are relatively short. They're not great, but it's does nothing weird. Like where you'd have to comment about it. They're not presidential hands. I'll say that. What's the price? Abe Lincoln probably has some long ass crazy. I mean, I just, uh, it's a, it's a weird thing to criticize though, because you're talking about something that someone can't change. It's like making fun of someone's ears when they're running for president.

Speaker 1:          02:11:08       Like, hey man, those are, but it's very strange. It's, it's uh, but it is a tell to Donald Trump that he can't not address it. Like if you, if you put that out there, he's got a comeback, but it worked. The problem is his comeback was effective. Yeah. So then he wins. So Marco Rubio, Marco Rubio, who's just this weird Mama's boy looking putts, like, like he's just isn't how many charisma when he would like be jabbing back and forth with trump. Like, dude, you're an amateur. Like he's going to chew you up. He's used to being criticized. He's used to being arrogant. He's used to shutting people down. Yeah. Well that's again, that's another one of my issues with, with Gary Johnson is that I just feel like, man, if the, if the LP wants to do something, if the libertarian, you know, if they want to, they want to have a moment here and you're telling me the hope is if we can get to 15% in the polls, then we get into a debate and I have to overlook the fact that this guy was already in a debate that nobody remembers because he didn't do anything in that.

Speaker 1:          02:12:03       And now he's got to go debate. Trump, trump, I you got to send someone who's got some type of, well he's going to be in the debates though, right? Gary Johnson? No, he's got to get 15% he's got to pull that and he's got to get into the polls. Then he's got to get 15% in the polls. It's a whole fucking fight and they also have to choose which polls, but I don't think they find him threatening. It might actually be smart for them to allow him to expose, I mean I think both sides would probably think that he would expose something that the other side has and both sides would probably be under the impression there an opportunity to capitalize on it. Well, I think the left side, because he's a lifelong Republican, sees him is more likely to peel away votes from trump. So in a weird way I think they want him in there because they want to, they want to hand it to Hillary.

Speaker 1:          02:12:48       He might be able to take advantage of some of that, but I, I don't know. I think they, even though this is a whole different year, they really like the, the control on the two party system. You know, the last time, uh, a third party really made any noise was, was Ross Perot and they changed all the rules after that guy got out of there to mention like presidential debates. That's right. It used to be like the, uh, women in the League of women voters or whatever. It used to run it. And then that now that just the Democrats and Republicans, right. Like they were like, let's never let that happen again. Yeah. They fucked up. They let that a crazy old billionaire by time on TV. Remember that? Yup. You're being hoodwinked. I'll show you how know you don't want some crazy old Texas billionaire on television in the 1980s or whenever the fuck it was.

Speaker 1:          02:13:30       It's, um, it's just, it's one of those things to me where I don't see how it's going to change. I look at, I go, boy, they can just keep running this fucking game for another four years and another four years and it'll keep going. And then we'll be like 70 going, what the fuck? Man? Still think so. I think that's it. I think we're, we're on the verge of, of the collapse. And I don't know exactly where it verges like, I dunno, you know, how much longer president trump might do it. Maybe. Maybe. But if you, I think if you look at a few kind of like fundamentals, we're in the process of an empire fallen. Yeah. Like the far, far too expanded militarily, drowning in debt. And if you really look at the dead, I mean, it's not just the 19 trillion. There's like over a hundred trillion in unfunded liabilities.

Speaker 1:          02:14:14       Like all these Medicare and social security and all these programs there are, they're all going to blow up. Uh, we've, we've also got, you know, just trillions and trillions of dollars that are extended being held at these big banks that there's all these factors. And also look at the moral kind of like, uh, the cultural decay kind of going on that trump, I think kind of embodies. I think there's a lot of indicators that were in the, in the crash process. He embodies the cultural decay in, in that one sense. Then on the other sense, you've got the co two cultural decay by social justice warriors and paper super over sensitive who Ralph Nader's rallying against. Now Ralph Nay, but I pulled this up on twitter today, a Ralph Nader was saying that the men today are over sensitive because they never had to deal with the draft. He's like, you're, you're, you guys are complaining about nothing like this is nonsense.

Speaker 1:          02:15:06       Good for Ralph Nader. Them look at this, this Ralph Nader on trigger warnings. Young men are far too sensitive because they've never been in a draft and that fucking hilarious. They're talking about trigger warnings, but trigger trigger warnings make me want to fucking hit somebody. It really does. It's insanity. It makes me so, it's so fucking stupid that you're supposed to protect people from true. First of all that is not even have trigger works triggers work by like being in a place where something bad happened to you or hearing a sound or seeing a thing. It's not bringing up the act of like if someone says you know, Murder, oh my dad was murdered, it's a trigger warning. Why didn't you warn me? The trigger, it hit me. Like that's how, but that's the whole world's going to trigger you then. Then every fucking piece of media, every movie, every television show has the potential for being a trigger warning is really, and like, it's not as if like, uh, I just hate people and I don't care if you're triggered and you know, deal with your past.

Speaker 1:          02:16:00       Like I think we have a big epidemic of soldiers coming back suffering from PTSD. I'd like to not send them towards so we don't have to deal with this, but the idea that we should, we should change. We should like nerf foam the world. Yeah. In case your triggered. So a college now can't explore anything they want to because what if someone had something violent in their past happen and then it seems to be a very convenient thing where, you know, like the feminists or the social justice warriors are like policing rape jokes in the comedy community, but they don't ever seem to

Speaker 2:          02:16:30       be policing like a war joke or a, you know, it's like they don't seem to care about men being triggered. And uh, like you were saying, it's mostly just infantiles bullshit. It's just these privileged kids on college campuses who are like want to shut down a conservative speaker from talking. It's a civilian sanity. Yeah, it's, it's, it's so fucking, the way they're doing is rabid. It's like there's so frothy at the mouth and so like taken away with the idea that they're doing some incredible right and this has to be done and there's this justice must prevail and transgender people should be able to use the women's room without, you know, any questioning whatsoever about where they stand. Like there's some weirdness going on today that is like what we were talking about when people are young, when you could send them to war. Then when you send these young people to war that they don't, they don't really have enough data yet.

Speaker 2:          02:17:23       Well, there's a lot of that going on with as a social war and these people don't have a lot of data either and they're just furious and foaming at the mouth and when all is said and done, the dust settles when they're older, they're probably not even going to be on that team anymore. You know, you're, you're probably going to wise up and realize how fucking goofy those people you're hanging around with are who are getting mad at white people for wearing dreadlocks. Oh, my social appropriation. Cultural appropriation. It's like, listen, we all hate white people in dreadlocks, but you've actually made me someone I hate more than white people in dreadlocks. That's how much you fucked up. Not only that, you don't even know where dreadlocks came from. First of all, why do people have had dreadlocks throughout history? That's what you, when you were comparing the kind of cultural decay from the trump supporters and the social justice warriors.

Speaker 2:          02:18:05       I do see a lot of it just rooted in like Anti Intellectual Ism. I mean, there's just like, no, it doesn't matter. You don't need to know anything you need. I mean they'll, they will shut down. Uh, Christina Hoff summers speech. Yes. But I think she's amazing. I saw you did a great podcast with her. Uh, but the, I mean, she is, she's a feminist. She's a liberal, a liberal feminist who's just going, oh, by the way, your data is a little off. Yes. Rape apologist. Exactly. She just talks about the facts and she, she calls herself a factual feminist. That's her statement. And there's, there's something wrong with telling people they have things wrong to them. I mean, this is how crazy the left has gotten because you're, you're what, you're, you're 20 and you figured everything out evidently. Well, it's just noise. There's a lot of noise and sometimes in those noises or some important points on both sides.

Speaker 2:          02:18:57       But boy, there's a whole lot of noise too. And it's, it's, it's a lot of arguing, a lot of yelling gets done that not a lot of progress gets made. Just people digging their heels and they take aside and they draw a line in the sand. And if you've got the people on the right and the people on the left and oof. Yeah, like you said at the beginning of it becomes a big like team I identity thing and then you're like, then it's just justifying the position you're already in. So you're just looking for kind of, you know, confirmation bias like my team's right or my teams. Right. And Yeah. And is everybody so God damn sensitive, like the gender Pronoun thing is so fucking bananas. Like you should know that if you're a dude and you look like a woman, okay. That people are going to get that wrong on occasion.

Speaker 2:          02:19:41       Like, okay, what, what, what do you look like? Okay. Do you look like Catherine Zeta Jones in a bikini? Well, if you do, people are going to say her and if they say her, that's not a bad thing. Oh, you're assuming my gender. You know, there's people out there that they think that you should name your dog gender neutral names cause your dog can't decide. Like this is a real debate amongst feminists and social justice warriors who have animals, whether or not they should impose their stereotypes that they have on human beings, on their dogs and cats. But there's some look and it's just insanity. But I feel like there's something like on these college campuses that's almost like that's housing, that they're letting them develop these ridiculous ideas. And I'll tell you, I think part of it, I really blame the college professors for a lot of this because I think these are also people who have, a lot of them have lived in college their entire lives.

Speaker 2:          02:20:28       There are people who go to college and then just stay in college and they get post, you know, graduate degrees and then they teach and they're kind of letting this happen and no one's going like, okay, shut up. That's not a real issue. Right. Look, I'm, I'm all for like, I'm a completely return. You should be able to, if you, if you have a doctor who's willing to perform a surgery on you and you want to identify as her instead of him, I'll call you her. Cause who cares? I'm not going to call you zee. No, that's fucking ridiculous. But you also can't, even if I'm willing to call you something, you can't make it a huge issue with not everybody is willing to call you that like this isn't, let me see or is here. Have you seen here her that's, yeah, there's like 18 of those now yet.

Speaker 2:          02:21:09       Like Lgbtq is not even close to all the letters that are on that thing anymore. Well how about in New York? They're going to find businesses if they intentionally mis-gender you so you can get sued and fine for like a quarter million dollars have you don't call someone Z. Yeah. See and this is where, this is where it becomes like a real fucking problem is it's like, okay, you know what? You guys can have your little fun and games and your safe space on college campus, all you want to. But now you start bringing in the forceful arm of government to actually go fuck over a business owner who's trying to provide jobs and you know, feed his kids. But even it becomes a problem even in colleges because what if you don't subscribe to those ideologies and you gotta go to school with these monkeys and they're all running around insisting there their pronoun a, Z, h e. And if you don't say it, you're a shit Lord. Like whoa. Yeah. Well, it's also real scared of the fact that if you've ever, you know, had a drunken hookup, you're a rapist, which is by the way, only the man only demand of course. And that's what happened at Occidental here. And, um, when we talked about on the podcast with, um, professor renegade history

Speaker 6:          02:22:10       three

Speaker 2:          02:22:12       fattiest Russell, daddy's Russell, who's brilliant, brilliant guy. And, um, we were talking about how incredible it is that they find a way to justify to people hooking up with text messages where the girl saying, come over, bring condoms.

Speaker 1:          02:22:26       They have sex and the guy is the one who is a rapist because they were both drunk. That's insane. The guy got kicked out of school and he's still in the middle of lawsuit lawsuits. It's, it's, it's insane. But it's also like a fascinating glimpse into how you see things because it's weird how you, it's almost like these guys come back to be the caricature of what the 1950s chauvinist was supposed to be. Assuming that women are these fragile, delicate creatures. Exactly. Handle the same thing a man can. It's like you're really being the sexist here. Exactly. Like all those guys. Um, who, who would like I remember was a big thing on your show when Jamie Kilstein was on about the Tosh, a rape joke. But I always want, I wonder what I, and I've argued with a few people like that, who I do now, by the way, I'm not throwing this out in the stupid way that it's thrown out when they go.

Speaker 1:          02:23:10       More men are raped and women are raped. That's not, but why is it seeing as that, that is a fact, prison included and stuff like that. Why is that? Every time you think of this scenario where someone's triggered from a rape joke, it's always a woman you always like, what if there's a woman in the crowd who's been triggered and what if this like it's never a concern that it could be a man. It's cause we were tribal and we break off into male versus female teams. If the males are the rapists on both accounts, men are raping the women and they're raping the man. See, I told you man, her shit, the raping each other, right? But no one seems to feel for that rape victim because of men because they're on the wrong team. I'll dude, you're on a shitlord team. Kurt made this up point.

Speaker 1:          02:23:47       Did you ever see the law and order episode when they did tell you now? No, but do you ever seen any Milan order? They did the one on standup comics and rape jokes. No, dude, it's no they did. It's the worst thing that's ever been made. Oh Dude. It's not even like, you can't even believe how bad it is until you see it. It's like this, this, this guy. Makes a rape joke at him not at a comedy club. And of course it chills because that's what happens when you tell a woman in the crowd. You hope she gets raped. Everyone just laughs at the top of the anyway, and then, uh, and then by the end, then she gets raped after that because he made the rape joke. It leads to rape and then I'll do you one better at the end. He's actually the rapist, the guy telling the rape joke.

Speaker 1:          02:24:26       It turns out to be the way it was, like the most ridiculous, irresponsible thing ever at a Kurt, Kurt medsker made this point. I just think it's so fucking funny, but he goes, don't think threatened men with rape on every episode of that show. Like every episode, they're like, you better start talking and then like, you don't do very good in prison. And you're like, well, really? You're not going to just go clean that up. You're gonna threaten me with it. But you're going to use that as a negotiation tactic. That's so fun. What's, it's just shitty show. Those shows were all shit. Every one of those crime shows. What the fuck is it about America where we want to watch hospital shows and police shows. That's all we want to watch. We want to watch people that are in trouble is trying to hide from the law or someone that's worried that mom's not gonna make it and they're holding our hand on. The doctors work in fiercely and the young handsome doctor, he leaves after 16 hours and he's sweating. He takes his hand and then another guy comes in with a gunshot wound and back to work. Wow. So noble cut to commercials for fucking

Speaker 2:          02:25:24       tie deodorant and whatever. Something about poo and fucking Toyota trucks and nobody goes to sleep. She'd wake up in the morning, I'm tying to consume. We are a weird fucking people over the weirdest thing where the weirdest thing, it's because collectively you have to look at us as what we are as a giant super organism. Like what are we waiting on? We would look at it ourselves inside of our culture and our belief systems and our actions and what gets done and the pollution in the environment, but overall, what is the species doing when you're looking at it as an outsider, if you were completely removed from culture, completely removed from tradition and communication. He just looked at us as like some weird organism like what is it trying to do? What's just making better stuff all the time? That's all it's doing and all this other stuff that it does is just to distract it while it's making better stuff.

Speaker 2:          02:26:15       All these little chicken dances and peacock feathers and all the fucking weird noises it mags and virtue signaling. I have a mattress and I'm carrying it around to my rapist is brought to justice. All that madness and all the arguing and all the craziness is going on. It's just a distraction. While it's making better and faster computers, that's all it is. It's, it's creating an artificial life form. It's going to do it under this guise of of of Christianity and Islam and all these different things. He's like, oh no. Well, you know as long as the way, oh no Christians way. Meanwhile these a robot, a robot overlord that the switch is about to get turned on and you're fucked. You're all fucked. But it's almost like you out. It's, it's the evolutionary game of numbers we were saying before. So you need it. Throw all these people out to get a tiny percentage that will be geniuses that we'll keep this thing moving and then you need, the rest of us are basically just waste.

Speaker 2:          02:27:08       It's like, yeah, you're just jerking off and watching some dumb reality show. But if you keep fucking keep fucking, eventually a genius will pop at who will move this thing forward a little bit and a little bit. And then the robot, we're essentially like a giant hive of worker ants with potential options. Like he really can write Harry Potter and break away from the rest of the worker ants. You really can't have a kid. It's a fucking matching genius cause he dropped him on his head when he was a baby. They don't want to tell anybody why this kid is so fucking good at math. There's a lot of that going on man. And those little fuckers grew up to be like some Ilan musk character that starts making electric cars in the hyperloop that gets you to San Francisco in three minutes. There is some weird shit happening and it's all happened in like exponentially all around us all the time adding up while we're worried about trigger warnings and whether or not trainees can use the fucking men's room or the women's room and like that whole particularly, I mean that's angry, that whole culture on the left of whatever you want to call it.

Speaker 2:          02:28:04       Like the social justice warrior that people call it the regressive left. I like that term a lot. I like that term, but it really is just insanity. I was watching, uh, recently the, um, did you ever see the uh, the 30 for 30 on the Duke Lacrosse? Yes. I mean it's first

Speaker 1:          02:28:22       of that, that accusation, it's not like there was a, it was a gray area or like they had sex and she was a little drunk or they had like nothing happened. They didn't have sex. This crazy person who's in jail for murder now made something up and it's interesting to watch it and like looking back, you know that what happens, you know she made it up and seeing the, the social justice warriors protest to these guys and the White Knights, the dudes who are hanging out right next to the feminist chick going, these lacrosse guys are out of control and they should go to jail. And you're like, dude, nothing fucking happened. How about Nancy grace as you guys never even took any heat for that? She was on TV calling for their arrest on TV, accusing them of this in front of millions and millions of people and somehow or another she didn't get sued somehow or another, she didn't get brought to jail.

Speaker 1:          02:29:07       They should have pulled her fucking show off the air. You should. I mean, what? What does it take to get fired? It takes being a man. She was a man doing the exact same thing about a woman doing something horrible. Oh, I bet you're right. Yeah. He was a team of women and that did something tear that were alleged to have done something terrible. And she was ranting and he was ranting and raving about these women being brought to justice and brought to jail. And it turns out it was, there was no crime being committed at all. You'd have to apologize. You would, she didn't even have to apologize. She didn't do shit. I can't remember who the other reporter, um, you remember at the end of the documentary, this is the one who apologizes, but she actually, she goes like, she, um, she's like, look, I, she apologized and she wrote a thing, like an apology to them.

Speaker 1:          02:29:45       Oh No. Then they cut back to the, the articles that she was writing at the time. And it's like this insane. She's like, these boys all know what happened and they know they're guilty and they need to be punished for this, blah, blah. And then she's even in acknowledging it, she goes, well, you know, I do think the fact that I was sexually assaulted in college probably did come into play. And how core fucking snow. Well, guess what, now you can't be a journalist. And then not only that, I don't know what to tell you. What really happened in college. Do we know or are you calling sexual assault, getting drunk and getting fucked because that might have happened to cause that's really acceptable to say today. Yeah, and that's disturbing as fuck man. And look, even if you were, even if she was completely, you know, in like legitimately sexually assaulted, not any of these bullshit gray areas, like it was an actual sexual assault.

Speaker 1:          02:30:32       The idea that you would you like you're covering a sexual assault case. Okay. And you were sexually assaulted before, so right away what an honest journalist would do would be recused yourself. You would go, I can't really do this because I'm too emotionally invested in something that happened in my life. But now to not do that, you're covering this, something that happened to you that you would have to be aware of. I've got to make sure I don't let that creep into my professionalism. But you're using that to try to, you know, justify go after these guys. And then after it's been proven that it was incorrect. Well she did. To her credit, she did apologize once it was proven to be incorrect, but still, like you said, that's not enough. But didn't you say that in in the apology and the apology, she was saying how she had been sexually assaulted. She was kind of using that as a, as an excuse. You can't do that. It doesn't mean it doesn't mean anything to these guys cause they didn't do anything. So they're totally innocent.

Speaker 2:          02:31:19       Those are someone's babies, someone's babies, young boys who grew up to be young men and they didn't do shit. And you are writing stories saying that they know what they did. It's like if you were a therapist and you were, you were seeing like some 16 year old kid and you told them to cut off all ties with their parents and then it turned out their parents were like really wonderful people and you're like, you know, part of it might've been that my parents were really bad. So I told them, they're like, well then you can't be a shrink anymore. I don't know what to tell you, but you're bad at your job. Yeah. Well that's cult tactics, right? There's one of the big things they do is tell you to get away from your parents, get away from your family. That's a big one.

Speaker 2:          02:31:55       Which to be fair, a lot of people's families probably suck, so it's really easy. Yeah, it's easy. If you, if you saw most of the people who end up in cults, I bet their families did really suck too. They're lucky. A lot of those people that are in calls, they're lucky. They're not sucking Dick for cheeseburger somewhere. A lot of them are just morons like, yes, look, there's a frequency that some people operate on. It's really easy to fucking hijack their, there's a lot of people out there that are just dumb and you're not going to fix that. They're doll doll minded folk that really could be easily influenced and that's why democracy is such a fuck system to begin with because it's just play. It's all everyone who's playing to that who can whip those people up and get on their frequency, and then there's smart people that can be manipulated, they can maybe manipulated once they attach themselves to an ideology.

Speaker 2:          02:32:41       Like we were talking about, like people on the left that are avoiding all the craziness about Hillary. Like you had a quote that I really liked that's on your twitter. You know that if like Hillary was a man that had done the all the same things that she like, what is the quote? What does it your exact, I see. Like I said, if hillary was a male republican with the exact same voting record, all of her supporters would hate her with a passion. Yeah, it's true. And it's 100% sure. 100% true. I mean, it's not, this is not controversial in any way, shape or form. Hillary is is, you know, I mean in the stuff I was saying before, but she's, she's like courting the left. She's courting people who are supposed to be liberals and you'll go, she's supported every single war of my lifetime, every single war.

Speaker 2:          02:33:24       Well, nothing that they can get past that. She didn't support gay marriage up until 2013 even their pet issues. Yeah, it's, she's, she's a weird one man. She's a really, really weird one. That fucking Libya thing. We came, we saw, he died like, that's okay. Like are you kidding me? What you remember when, uh, the fucking Vermont Guy Screamed? I know we're going to go all the way Howard Dean and that one yell did men it, that's it. They saw it and they're like, fuck this guy. We, we came, we saw he died. Ha ha ha. Like that doesn't, you don't think that lady is fucking crazy. You don't think that lady's fucking cars. I mean, you're down for her. That's, that is a completely an ideology thing. [inaudible] she's, she's on your team. You're going to, you're going to go along with it. Just, it's a religion just like you're, you're subscribing to some predetermined thing.

Speaker 2:          02:34:22       It says, it's just, it's weird for me to see, first of all, it's weird that she wants to be president. Like, aren't you old? Like you're an old lady. How much energy do you have? Got a ton of money. You just had your first grandkid, you got like perspective, like what are you trying to do? He's trying to make history as a woman. Is that what it is? I mean, do you want to just like get back at your husband for getting his Dick Sucked and in 1991 or whatever the fuck it was? Yeah. I mean, I don't even think it's that. I think it's, it's, I mean, who knows who I, you know, I'm not in their head, but I think these people are like power brokers that just want more and more of it and it's a real, it is probably a thrill unlike anything we could imagine to have that much power and they've, they've tasted a little bit of that, you know?

Speaker 2:          02:35:06       Yeah. Just, it seems to me that she's like so old, but she would just want to chill, you know? It just doesn't make any sense to me. She's, she's an old lady. Like she doesn't have good health. I, that was the other thing that concerned with, she had some health issues, right? I think she had like concussions or something. Yeah, there was, it was hit in the head. I forget what it was, but it was when beat the fuck out of our imagine that turns out the bill just wailed on her and she wants to keep it quiet. Bill fucking Kot he had kicked her. He's been accused of violence. Wow. She has suffered from fainting spells since at least 2005 and that year she passed out, presumably sober while giving a speech in 2012 she passed out yet again and suffered a concussion. Holy Fuck. Presumably sober is something that if they ever have to say it, it's just not good.

Speaker 2:          02:35:51       You got issues. We're always presumably sober. I'm not usually pursuing me, but all right. You know, but this idea that she fell asleep and hit and hit her fucking head, like when people fall and hit their head, it's one of the worst things about getting knocked out is not getting punched in the head. It's you falling down and getting hit in the head with the earth, like their, their heads bounce off the ground. That's like a big issue in street fights and stuff. When you watch someone get sucker punched, they fall down and their head gets bounced off the curb. And I think people who have like epilepsy and things like that, like that's the big fear. What happens is that that you end up cracking your head on the ground. It's not just the seizure seizures. Um, yeah, there's, there's something, I don't know, Hillary Clinton said recently, and this would probably be one of the tactics she tries to use against trump, but she said something along the gut.

Speaker 2:          02:36:39       She goes, you know, I just, I don't know if he's the type of guy we would want having control of the nuclear codes. And it's just like an interesting thing to look at what your like how crazy is it that any one person has control of those nuclear codes? Like we're just counting on one person to not snap, to not kill the whole world. Yeah. Hopefully you don't ever just like, I've had enough. I'm fucking right. Well, we know that people kill themselves. Right? That alone should just disqualified human beings from having that kind of power. Are Human beings capable of killing people? Yes. For no reason. Yes. Randomly. Yes. Um, what about killing themselves all the time? How often? Every day. How many people? A lot. Oh, well we can't have people run it. So let's have a person who's, uh, a politician who's in the highest stress job.

Speaker 2:          02:37:27       Imagine about, let's have them just have control of those codes. Unfortunately, that is the green light for the robot overlords to take over because we can't trust people. Will, the robots are just going to be way more sober about this. They're going to make rational decisions based on logic and mathematics and possibilities and probabilities and the understanding of human race that we really can't comprehend because we're just monkeys. Is this when you brains, you bring me into your giver society. Now I'm gonna bring you to one of those landmark meetings. It was landmark forum meetings. Yeah. Um, I think that it's this entirely, uh, it's entirely possible that ai is going to be how we dictate government in the future. Yeah. Allen Iverson is going to rule out on the varsity basketball as well, but they used to call them Ai. Don't joke. Uh, but yeah, it is.

Speaker 2:          02:38:17       It does seem like that'd be an interesting tipping point. I do feel like I'm more on the side of technology than on the side of being afraid of it. Oh yeah, me too. I just feel like it's going to be more of a, it's, it's humans will be guiding it at least to a certain point and I think it's gonna make life a lot better. I think we are some weird CNN enemy type character, some weird fucking primitive life form that has really kind of outdated and it's not going to, we're not going to make it. You think we're going to have to combine. We're gonna symbiotic. We're going to become symbiotic. We're going to definitely have computer chips in. Our brain will start off with. You'll be able to store your memories and sharing with your grandchildren. All we have to do is install this chip and then next thing you know we'll be get increase your vision with this retina implant and we can double your Iq in three weeks.

Speaker 2:          02:39:06       Oh fucking sign me up. But it's hard to say no, no. Well I know that your joints are bothering you, Mr. Wilson. Let's replace your hips with artificial hips. Oh, okay, let's do it. Okay, now you've got artificial hips and you're like, you know what? We found a new way to replicate the spine without any of the pain and issues and uh, we're just going to replace it all with Titanium and Oh, okay, well I'm in. And then next thing you know, your, your, your bones getting brittle, sir, you're getting old. Well, fortunately we figured out a brain transplant with a bio identical body. We're going to take your brain and only be outside of your current body for three minutes. Whoa, hold on. Okay, what am I now? Because I'm now, I'm a brain inside a new body. I don't want to do that surgery the first year they come out with it.

Speaker 2:          02:39:47       I want to wait like a few years, let them work the kinks out. No problem with that is those people that got, at first we'll take over, there'll be reading each other's minds and flying and breathing under water and you just want to have a chance to compete. Good. Did, they're going to gather up all the money and the resources. They're going to have all the hookers and then they don't even need hookers because they can get there. I was going to say, take an orgasm just by pressing their temple Jews in their pants for that. That'll be a big turning point, man. If they can ever create a thing where like our sexual desires are taken care of. Oh yeah. We don't need, I mean, yeah, that's, that'll be an interesting, uh, just fundamental change in humanity when people get addicted to that and that's going to be a virtual reality thing, but then it will be hollow because they're going to get addicted to it and they're not going to be any consequences.

Speaker 2:          02:40:28       Like one of the things about sexual conquest, I think it's one of the same things with all sorts of uncertainty. You never know how it's gonna turn out. And so there's risk involved and it's scary and people get addicted to this risk. And even the risk of rejection, I mean it's not like really scary, like anything could go wrong, but there's a game going on. Like, can I get these people to love me? Like how do I get these people to want me? Oh, I got to have the right chains on the right car and show up at the right place. And you know, you need to get the right spot where there's a table service and you know, I have to have a bunch of people that are famous around me so that I looked like a pimp. You know what I mean? Like there's the whole identity thing and then it validates your identity to get that check doesn't always work.

Speaker 2:          02:41:09       Some girls come up and like this mother fucker think he something and she walks off like that bitch. She doesn't even know who I am, you know? And they, they're trying to like figure out a way to become special. Well if everybody just has to, you know, just download the fuck program and all of a sudden you're in an orgy with a hundred thousand tens all lining up to blow you. Like where's the fun in that real, but that's why the human, the human experience works in strange ways. So maybe then that's what we'll be attracted to. Like, you know, people will want to go back toward kind of the thrill of the hunt. He's like, oh that's easy. I think it'll be more like a video game where video games are no fun. If you get to play on God mode, you know, you play a video game on God mode, he can't get shot.

Speaker 2:          02:41:46       You run around blowing everything away. You when it's, there's no thrill. They're so easy. It's no consequences. The Allen, uh, Helena, what's his name? Alan Watts. You ever hear that guy? He's like a hippie short philosopher guys. But he was saying like the idea of like that's why basically this dream that is life. That's why it's like this. Oh cause we were like all powerful. But then we got to a point where that's no fun anymore. So you want to like have life. Yeah. What was his quote? He was talking about it game. He was saying if you were going to construct a game about human civilization, that's exactly what you can, you would construct, you would construct the game. That's like what we're doing right now and this is exactly how a divine being would play. Well he, well the one I heard him, he was like saying like almost like imagine like you've already lived through all those God mode games.

Speaker 2:          02:42:30       You've got bored of that. That's why you're here. Cause you're like, yeah, God mode is not that fun anymore. Let's say, you know, try something that's a little bit of a challenge. Yeah. And this is, you know, the level of challenge that you wanted. Well it's an interesting philosophy and it's an interesting perspective but lots of this shit, you know like obviously we don't know exactly where this is going to go. And you're, you're talking like a little bit out there. Not that this has even that far away. I mean if you look at like a Nokia phone was compared to where you know, these things are, I mean it's a, it's a big difference. It's not that far off into the future. But even just little things like I personally, I get really fascinated by what the implications towards government and how we organize society.

Speaker 2:          02:43:05       So when something, I mean we can just three d print guns and everybody can three d print a, I mean we don't really need a fight about the second amendment anymore cause you've got it. Everyone's going to have a gun if they want to have a gun. And I feel like there will be a lot of these types of things that just kind of know a fi a lot of government, whether or not it's like it doesn't matter because people can just go over here and do it. So we don't even need to have this debate which to meet should be the way lots of things are settled. Like, I mean who cares about debating over gay marriage or something like that. Like people associate, however they want to associate. That's one of those non issues that's an issue to people that are actually are gay that want to get married, but the reason why it gets bounced around, I feel like it's like a beach ball at a concert.

Speaker 2:          02:43:47       They just chuck it out there. Whenever there's like something really serious that people want to talk about, they throw that around as if it's like, oh, this needs to be addressed as well. Then it becomes a distraction and I think you're 100% right. I think it gets used as a distraction. I think it's also something where government, it's search itself somewhere and then there's going to be a debate over it. Whereas if government wasn't there, we just wouldn't need to have any of this. I mean, why does it feel the same way about the women's bathroom thing? Yes. Yeah. It just seems like, come on man, how many transgender people are really using these bathrooms? Right? Is this a giant issue and how has this issue been handed handled up until now and how has this issue being treated with more importance than so many real issues?

Speaker 2:          02:44:28       So one of the ones that I heard that was brought up, which is so bizarre, is a man who was born a man, he has a beard, he does not take hormones, but he identifies as a woman. He wants to use the women's room. He wants you to call him her and he has a beard. Yeah, I met a guy like that. Fall Asleep. You're not allowed to because when it comes to gender, you can't be preposterous. You, if you think you're a fox and you want to wear a Fox hat, I'm allowed to mock you. But if you're a 50 year old dude with a beard and you have lipstick on, you want to be called Z, you're not allowed to say anything. Now we're talking about gender, completely healthy, normal guy. You fuck you and fuck everybody who thinks like that. You guys are a bunch of little nonsense babies.

Speaker 2:          02:45:09       Yup. And you're ruining the way people communicate. What do we have left as comedians if a guy in a dress isn't funny. Exactly. I mean come on. Yeah, exactly. That's a really important point. Well, my point is that, you know what my, I was furious when this Caitlyn Jenner thing was going on. When you, you were supposed to say that she looks good. Like no one was allowed to go. Whoa, Whoa, whoa. What the fuck? Wait, hold on. Surgeries good now. Like it's good to get your jaw shave down. Everybody should celebrate that and say you look really good. Like, no, she doesn't look good. 60 year old dudes and dresses almost never look really good. Yeah. Like even if, if she was like, if it was a chick at that age, I probably wouldn't be talking about how good she looks, but you're telling me a dude in a dress, those a dick.

Speaker 2:          02:45:56       Right. But like had some stuff done to his face and I have to pretend that's a hot chick man. Right. Frozen face, Weird Chin thing going on where they shaved his chin down or her chin down and then gets a boob job. Let me tell you something. If you're a 60 year old and you get a boob job, someone needs a fucking hug. You okay? Yes. Relax. If what if Hillary Clinton got a boob job and she just was like, I want to show Donald Trump. These babies are here to run the country. Like, whoa. I mean, this is the, this is literally what we're talking about. I would like her billary Clinton is, she's at a commensurate age, right? How old is she? 64 she's 70 she's close to 70 maybe 60 how old is Bruce Jenner? He's like 63 or [inaudible] 64 there in the fucking ballpark. Yep.

Speaker 2:          02:46:39       There were in the ballpark. So if Hillary all of a sudden got a boob job, everybody be like, what the fuck is wrong with her? But he gets a boob job and because it's about gender, we're all supposed to just ignore the fact that he's got a frozen face. That's the chins been cut with a fucking grinder to resemble a female face. Like what? All things are Po, what? I don't think she's 68 then the same. Yeah. Same Dyke out Jesus Christ. They're exactly that. They could take out dairy. He is good. He's got a dick. It'll scare the shit out of her as a dyke session. You don't want him to show up that you shit Lord. He's a shit. Lord will. Uh, but look, there is something also like the, I, I don't, I'm not like a psychoanalyst. I mean I don't know, but are we just going to just because of like this political pressure throw out the possibility that it, it seems to say that maybe you have some issues that you want to self mutilate yourself like this.

Speaker 2:          02:47:31       I mean like this is healthy behavior. Whatever happened to loving yourself. Whatever's happened in loving yourself as who you are. Like why, why did that get distorted? Like well, how come surgery now is the viable alternative? How come injecting a non in dodges hormones, exogenous hormones, female hormones into a male body? How come you, how come you have to say that that's a girl? Why is gender such an important point to you? Like what, what is it about this that's so important to you and to, and to deny that gender and sex or are like biologically relevant, you know, categories that it's not just something randomly assigned at birth, right? I mean, okay. For one that of 100,000 babies, maybe it's, it's something that's assigned at birth. I know people always bring up that example where some babies aren't the number is, but there's, there's, there's gotta be a lot of people where they feel like they're trapped in the body that they don't want to be in.

Speaker 2:          02:48:30       And that's cool. If you want to, you want to, I'm cool with sex changes. I'm cool with everything. I'm not, I'm not trying to restrict people's behavior, but there's something really weird, I guess it's like an overreaction to people. I think in a way it's probably a good thing. So people trying to be more sensitive, trying to be more open minded, trying to be more accepting. And that'll probably balance out. Like we go way out to the left and then we'll come back more to the middle and everything will kind of balance it out. And you'll see the difference between people that are people that are just like happier being a woman and then people that are out of their fucking mind. Like there was a radio lab show about a guy who goes back and forth like he's a woman then he's a man, he's a woman, he's a man.

Speaker 2:          02:49:08       I just switched. He's like, I just switched over now I'm gail. Like he becomes a woman. Like, wait, you're just a woman now. Like you were just a man now who am I talking to you now? Now Mike, Mike's back, something's got it. I see you're a fucking crazy person. Look, if that's not weird is anything weird? Come on land, but you don't. But then people go well with his crazy, you know what's crazy? I agree with what you were saying that there is, there is almost, I feel like the general, like there's a large group of people who are just trying to kind of not be dicks. Like you were saying like, oh, we're just trying to not be dicks to people so there'll be good. But I feel like the people leading the charge are like trying to kind of wag their finger at someone.

Speaker 2:          02:49:45       Like they're trying to go like, no, see you're not tolerant. I'm tolerant. It's like you're not, it's a virtue signaling. That's what Michael Shermer calls it. He's like, you're trying to show yourself as to be more virtuous than the other people. So you attack them for having a lack of a strong stance and these things that you have a strong stance in and so, and even when he's strong stances, like really debatable like this, this whole subject, you know, and I'd love the fact that these guys kept getting busted after they pass these laws, allowing men, transgender women to use the women's room. These creepy men were calling themselves transgender and going into the, well this is exactly what you knew was going to happen. You knew it was going to happen. Right? Like, look, if you really want people to use a third bathroom, here's what you do.

Speaker 2:          02:50:29       Get the people that support that to fund it, get it, get them to fund it across the board. Everybody else fuck off. Like, how many people are we talking about here, man, that we need a third bathroom. But that's, that's why I, I, I hate the whole system of taxation and government and all this shit cause right there that that can be applied to so many different things. Right? Like even if it's something like planned parenthood or something like that, like I'm, I'm, uh, you know, I think it's a very complicated issue, but I'd probably lean on the pro choice side. Uh, but it's like what you're going to force someone who believes abortion is murder to fund a place that commits what they see as murder. Why don't you liberals just get together and fund it yourself? Like why do you have to force all these other people to fund something that you deem to be a value that they don't write?

Speaker 2:          02:51:13       For sure. That's debatable whether or not taxes should fund something like that. Yeah, I mean, I don't even, truthfully, I mean, I don't think it's the bit, I think it shouldn't, I think they shouldn't. I agree. No one should also things to fit if you believe in it. Like you said, you should fund it and it should be something that the community funds. Sure. I mean, look, as far as it was, planned parenthood doesn't just provide abortions. They also provide gynecological care. They provide birth control. There's like, this is some really important parts of that, but it just gets a lump. They should have like abortions are us. And then just like, let's straight away, there's no birth control here. Our birth control is a vacuum. That's it. That's all we have, isn't that, that was, you know, I mean that's probably a, that that would clear up this.

Speaker 2:          02:51:52       And then you'd say, well, maybe planned parenthood would be a different entity. It'd be birth control, things along those lines. Well that as a responsible society, it might be a good idea to invest a certain amount of money. Reproductive healthcare like that. That sounds smart. And this is another thing that a technology might, you know, solve real quick. I mean, once we can kind of create womb light conditions outside the womb, it might greatly cut down on the norm, the number of abortions that are needed. Yeah. That's where I'm gonna be real weird now. That's going to be real weird when they decide that the the body, like women can be far more productive if their baby is born outside of the body. Yeah. But they'll always be like a natural movement. Of course. They'll always be like people who are like, well no, no, no, I don't want to do it that way.

Speaker 2:          02:52:32       Just even now there's people who have natural child and stuff, you know? It's like people like raw wood, like this table and they're like handcrafted drinks. They like, like that word Mike drinkers were handcrafted. Yeah. I'm going to have a handcrafted hotdog and even just even just enjoying nature, you know what I mean? Like the fact that we'd like to go out into nature, like we're so far removed with all this technology, but we still want to like, well I want to like I want to sit in the place where I would have died from an infection at 12 I don't want to like live there, but I want to like sit there for a little and then go inside. I want to lay motionless where the predators used to Rome.

Speaker 2:          02:53:06       It is fucking really weird that we call it the outdoors. Like I liked the outdoors. No, you mean the earth. You like the actual earth. We're just, we're so fucking into being in these structures that that's our standard place to be. The outdoors is rare. I liked the great outdoors. Like what do you, what the fuck are you talking about? How can you, like, we're defining ourselves by the inside of this structure primarily. This is, it's all afterwards, man. We're all on this fucking, I love that. Uh, that bit you were doing the other night. I don't want to like give out if it's new stuff you're working on, but there's a thing about just like paranoia of pot being good. Oh yeah. Yeah. We should, I hope be paranoid. I mean, yeah. Yeah. Well, there's, there's some, there's some reality to our life on a spinning ball that is regularly ignored, but really fucking crazy when you stop and think about this, the reality that we're in a convertible spaceship and you know, we don't talk about that, but we talk about all sorts of goofy shit.

Speaker 2:          02:54:11       We're, we're literally spinning a thousand miles an hour in a circle hurling through infinity. And the more we find out, the weirder it gets, the weirder, the more, you know, we think we know something and we're like, okay, this is what a black hole is. And then we figure something out. We go, okay, it's nothing like that. It's a no, and people get mad at Neil degrasse Tyson because he won't say he's an atheist. I think that's another hilarious aspect of atheism is how tribal atheism is. I'm been watching these, his forum where these people are fucking hurling the most disgusting and evil insults at Neil degrasse Tyson, simply because he won't say he's an atheist. He's open minded. And in Neil's like a scientist, you know, he's like, look, you know, I'm not a religious person, but I'm not going to say there's no god. Well, why not?

Speaker 2:          02:54:56       Why wouldn't need not? There's no fucking evidence that there is no god. Well, there's no evidence that there is a god. Yeah. That's what an agnostic is. That's why I like identifying as agnostic. Yeah, because there's like this atheist as almost like built up. They, they're almost, it's like so dogmatic and religious in their beliefs. Like you have to believe in this. There is nothing, nothing happens after daddy would admit that there's nothing. Dave admitting that there's nothing. It's like maybe I don't know nothing to do mushrooms and tell me there's nothing and that same, that same person will completely agree with you when they're on mushrooms. Then maybe when they were off they'll go like, eh, it was just a month. Ego will come back. It's a whole explanation. The visual Cortex is being affected by five, four, four, four o'clock and I'm a field trip to mean.

Speaker 2:          02:55:38       Yeah. Someone I remember arguing with him like a hardcore atheist about this and they were like, hey, really dude, that shit that goes on when you're on mushrooms, it's just a chemical reaction. You're like, yes, it is. So is every experience you've ever had in your life? Yeah. It's just the chemical reaction. Your life is a chemical reaction, so without the proper chemicals you, your brain goes crazy. You had hallucinations. It's was like, yeah, you get depressed, you get suicidal or you get euphoric. What do you think? MM MTMA is. It's a chemical reaction, but it's one that your brain already has. It's already in there. That's why it works. Yup, that's right. And you're finding a way to kind of a, to trigger to use their words to trigger that reaction that just gets you into, it's weird. It gets you into something that you already knew.

Speaker 2:          02:56:20       It's not even like new information. It's just like, it's something you already knew that you worked very hard to forget. We're so weird. People are so weird, but it's cool. It's cool that it's weird because like Allen Watson sang it makes it all fun. It makes us game entirely exciting. I'm fucking super pumped that this relations full of bullshit, that this election and this, this, this way we're interacting with each other as all chaos. Oh, I like it. I enjoy it. I would find it info like w like if you look at trump and Bernie sanders, like I don't, I don't love either of them. I've, I've problems with everyone. I think Hillary's the worst of the worst, but I have problems with all of them. But it's so, it would be so much more depressing to me if just like Hillary and Jeb Bush had just waltzed to the nomination.

Speaker 2:          02:57:06       It's like, like if the general sentiment of the public was like, we're happy, we're cool with the establishment. I love that people are, are like had had it. And I think it's a sign of the times. And I think the Internet is also a big part of that. I think people are just so much better informed than at any other time in the past. Oh, well for, for us, I mean for the, for the libertarian movement, like that's, we wouldn't exist without the Internet. So you clearly identify with a movement like Libertarians. Is there anything about being a libertarian that you don't like were libertarians or into other libertarians? Um, sure. I mean, there's like, there's, there's personal things about different groups and then there's some groups of Libertarians that, uh, I genuinely don't identify with it all. Like there's some, some kind of like Republicans who will just kind of call themselves libertarians but are okay with like fighting wars and stuff like that. So I don't like that. Um, libertarians can be kind of a weird group if you get

Speaker 1:          02:58:02       together and we'll just weird to be in a group. I mean, our subgroups weird, but that's why I don't, you know, I wouldn't be comfortable almost identifying with any other group to meet the libertarianism or volunteerism is really just a, it's like accepting of a principle that is, like I said before, like you, you, you shouldn't, uh, initiate violence against peaceful people. So I just, I, I'm okay with accepting that as like a fundamental truth to me. It's more online with being like an abolitionist during slavery times. It's just like, we shouldn't have slavery. What you do with yourself. I don't know. I'm not going to jump into a team of what job you should have. Right, but you shouldn't be forced to pick cotton. Yeah, no, I mean, and they're all the political ideologies, all the political distinctions. That's the one that makes the most sense to me.

Speaker 1:          02:58:45       I don't call myself a libertarian. I'm just sorry. I feel like the whole, the whole idea of representative government is so fucking goofy. I just think that any political party that doesn't address that is, it's like we're, we're spinning our wheels. If we're really allowing this whole stupid thing to go on the way it's gone on for so long, it was created back when it was really impossible to communicate with people, so you had to have a representative. Like now it's really easy to communicate with people, but we have the same system of government that we had back when people used to write with feathers. Right. It's fucking stupid. The idea of having a ruler, it's, it's insane. It's so dumb. And our robot overlords, they're going to fix it. They will. They will liberate us. They will. They will rise. They will fix it.

Speaker 1:          02:59:27       I'm really hoping they're libertarian. Jamie, don't we wrap this up? You were trying to show me something else. Is there something else that was going on? There's no other story. Just the Kimbo slice thing didn't. Yeah. All right dave, this was fun. I really enjoy this, this more often. When you, when you back in town and when can people come see your standup and where can they find out about you? Uh, well you follow me on twitter at comic. Dave Smith and I'm, I do a podcast called part of the problem, which is all about like this political stuff and libertarianism.

We're having skank fest. It's in New York City. It's on June 18th and 19th. We got some really fun guests for this one.
