Speaker 1:          00:00:00       Okay,

Speaker 2:          00:00:10       and we live these gentlemen, we're live supporting the latest round earth Shell. We're just coming out with it. Round Earth. She'll tee shirts. Both Jamie and I get $3 per month from the federal government to tell you that the world is round and Mick West is a big part of it all. He is one of the main shills that tells everybody that he knows that he has a whole website dedicated to arguing against people that think the world is flat. Yeah. The differences that don't get paid for it. And stop lying. I know you're getting 3:50 per month. Yeah, I wish I did. I would have to pay for my web hosting and it's a command in my pocket and nobody pays me anything. See, Mick West is serious. He's not joking around with us. Um, what this is to be one of the most bizarre trends.

Speaker 2:          00:00:55       And Jamie, I think you said at first that you thought it was originally a troll. You thought that they were fucking around, like, I still think some people are for sure. It's. Yeah, but I feel like it started out with like four Chan or something like that, or maybe you read it, these crazy kids, these wacky kids, they decided to start trolling saying that the earth is round or the earth is flat. Some of it. But a lot of it is just people who, uh, yeah, they, they actually believe it. Yes. There's a lot of extra people actually believe it. And then there's people who see that this people out there who believe it and then they start like kind of egging these people on. Yes. And then it becomes really, really hard to tell where the dividing line is, who's actually trawling and who's actually a genuine, true believer.

Speaker 2:          00:01:41       There are absolutely a lot of true believers, but there's also a lot of people with like little green frogs in their avatar that think it's fucking hilarious. Yeah, I think it's the kind of, uh, that type of person that's kind of uh, adopted it. Yes. Yes, yes. Uh, you know, you talking a shit posting the other. Yes. Yes. And that's just something that you could do is if you want to just annoy people, buy shit posting, you'll just post a bunch of flood earth memes because the so infuriating to the average person. But I just kind of a what the heck is this person is posting and uh, you know, the shit poster enjoys that type of thing. I was watching a video with this guy was ranting on and on, and then it's not theory that we need to stop accepting that the flat earth theory, but that it's a fact. We need to start accepting the fact that it's a effect. He was hilarious when we find this because I saved. It is a, I think his name was like Vegan warrior or something like that. Which is always a yes. The Egan Warrior. He's a realist. It says it's no long. He's not only a flat earth or he's a realist. Yeah, I think I've come across. I think this is actually a relatively small number of people who were really active in promoting the flood of stuff on, on Youtube. What's in the world is that they

Speaker 3:          00:03:00       keep claiming that all the photos of earth are fake, but they don't have a single photo of this fucking ice wall that's supposed to be around Antarctica and they keep saying erroneous Lee, that you're not allowed to fly over Antarctica. Like, yes you are. They keep saying that there's no photographs of earth from space that they're all composites. No, that's not true. Why do they keep saying that? They keep saying that there's a fucking saddle is a bunch of satellites, but there's one from Japan that takes high resolution photos of the earth every 10 minutes. The full earth from 22,000 miles away.

Speaker 4:          00:03:36       Yeah, that's the Japanese hemaware. Yes. But there's also like a, as a US satellite that was just launched last year that goes 16 satellite, which is basically the same resolution. Pull this sucker right up to your face. And the Russians, the Russians have a satellite, a. everyone's got their own satellite because he's basically the way that satellites. So they put him like, uh, oh, uh, the equator so they can see their own, uh, their own country. So Russia has one, you can mostly see India, China has one, it's not as good as the other ones, but the Russian one is there like a, you know, the same resolution, 121 megapixels as the size of the image that I do. It's like a 11,000 pixels by 11,000 pixels view of the earth and you can zoom in and you can, you can see cities, you can see contrary cells and you can actually use these images from the satellites to actually match up with the views of clouds and controls from the ground.

Speaker 4:          00:04:27       So you can actually check to see if these images are actually correct, at least for where you are. Right. Then you could like finding friends and somewhere else and ask them like, do you have this type of cloud overhead so you can actually verify whether these, uh, these images are actually real on it. Well I brought it up to my friend Eddie and he said it's all fake. He said all the photos of fake, they look fake. I'm like, but how would you know what a real photo of earth from 22,000 miles looked like? Wouldn't look exactly like earth. And I think when you get to that stage of deep belief, you kind of have to believe that they're fake. There's no way, a real challenge. Like how do you actually break through that for somebody? How can you actually, um, convince them that something isn't fake if they just automatically assume it's fake.

Speaker 4:          00:05:11       And I think has, has the person actually looked in detail at these images, most people know and how they looked at the fact that, you know, you get one every 10 minutes. I went every 15 minutes and do a, you know, every single images is 121 megapixel image and the old matches up exactly with what the weather is around the world and it matches up with all the other side images. One from the Russians were on from the Chinese run from the Japanese. Uh, they all match up. And I really don't think that the people who say, ah spake, I've really actually looked. No, you're absolutely right there. They definitely haven't, nor nor do they have any desire to. It's a belief issue and it's almost like a religious issue. It's a really fascinating. It's completely infected. The world of professional pool players, really professional pool player, a professional pool players.

Speaker 4:          00:05:58       There's a guy named cj Wiley's, a top pool player who's 100 percent convinced the earth is flat. There's another guy named Max everly's. A buddy of mine out of his mind thinks the world is flat. I wonder if that's related to their like obsession with the table being flat. No, I don't think so. You'd have to make sure that the temple's level, but then they got this little round balls on the table as well, so that's confusing, right? Yeah. You got a little solar system going on with your pool balls. What's confusing is they're smart guys like you. We talked to them. You'd be like, this is a reasonable intelligent guy. Are they really believing that his blood 100 percent, they're not shit posting jewel. This unusual people, they go down a youtube rabbit hole and that's part of the problem is once you believe something, yeah, it's very difficult to unbelievers.

Speaker 4:          00:06:40       It is and there's so much out there. Yeah. If you tell people to do some research or the end up doing is just looking at more videos, the confirm what they. They believe that they prefer the ones that come from it of course, but it's just amazing to me that people would decide that all of these photos were fake so that they don't believe the world is round, but yet they don't have a single photo of this fucking flat earth. Not One one photo. Not only that, every planet you see is round. You can. You could follow them. You could look at them with with if you have a reasonable telescope, you could see the difference as the change and spin. I mean you can tell that they're round. There's a lot of flood earth. Have the same camera that I've got, which is a Nikon p 900 flat earthers have an excellent camera.

Speaker 4:          00:07:29       They have A. I brought one with me. They have like Nikon has a deal with the flat earth society. Is this, this camera? It's just like, it's not like an slr or anything. It's just like a $600 camera, uh, but it's got this really, really long a zoom lens on it, like a, it's like a 200 millimeter zoom lens so you can see, you can zoom in on the move and you can zoom in on the stars and planets and you can use this camera. I've used it a few times to actually take pictures of Jupiter and have a Venus Mars and you can actually just make out the roundness of the planet and the actual shadow of the sun use. You'll see Venus as being like the move and being like an arch and you'll see jupiter and you see the bands of Jupiter and you can do that with this camera.

Speaker 4:          00:08:11       And this is a camera that a lot of them have because they're obsessed with zooming in on things that are on the horizon, like ships going beyond the horizon. But if they just start, take the same camera that they haven't pointed upwards, they would actually see things in the. In the sea, the solar system, basically the rudy come be explained any other way. One great thing is the moons of Jupiter. If you look up a Jupiter really closely, even with some binoculars, you can see it's got these four little moons that are orbiting it. Then it looks like to just follow the lights in the line with with Jupiter and they actually move around in a regular pattern and they move around. They've got all bits of like some of them are thinking like 80 hours or something. So they move around really fast. Like everyday is a completely different pattern of these little dots around Jupiter.

Speaker 4:          00:08:56       And you can actually see that with this camera. I've taken photos of it, posted them on the website or even with binoculars. And if you actually watch it from day to day, you will see the moons of Jupiter move in exactly the same way that science predicts us that they should move. Were you using Kepler's laws of planetary motion and Newton's Newton's law of gravitation? Uh, they will. Yeah, they, they move exactly as if they are a little simulation of a planetary system. So either the, some kind of weird hologram up in that little corner of the sky which moves around or there is actually a planet there with little moons orbiting it. Probably Hologram. What, what, when did you first become aware of this? Like you, you've run medibank for a long time. And for those who don't know, Mick and I met on the Scifi show that it did Joe Rogan questions, everything where we discussed chem trails or con trails and what causes a jet engine to make what looks like artificial clouds by passing through condensation in the heat of the engine produces these countries.

Speaker 4:          00:09:56       And people were absolutely convinced that these are, that they're spraying the government is sprang something in the sky. And uh, you, you caught it, you, you had a fairly good explanation for it. You said they're basically like training wheels for conspiracy theories because. Yeah, it's, it's, uh, something you can see. Yeah, I think he's said he's kind of more enticing. Yes. Uh, and I think the same thing applies to the flat earth. Now you got some. When I got into the flutter thing, it was, I became aware of it a few years ago. So yeah. So the government is turning up. Is that your camera? Yeah, yeah, the government spying on. Yeah. So like, uh, when I first heard about the flood of, they obviously have, I heard it before my actually my father going back, uh, when I was young, he told me that he was a member of the flood to society.

Speaker 4:          00:10:46       Your father told you that was he joking around? A kind of, but what he was doing it in a kind of a satirical way. Ironically, uh, he was doing it because like he was like saying people, uh, to sure of themselves. And so I'm going to join the flux of the society. He didn't believe the earth was round, so it's been around for quite a while. The flat Earth Society and the flesh, the flusher theory, uh, as beat around obviously like thousands of years ago, people thought the earth was round and then slightly fewer thousand years ago people figured out that it wasn't, it was figured out by the ancient Greeks like 3000 years ago that it wasn't a um, by the. It wasn't that. It wasn't, it wasn't flat. Sorry. Oh, you fucked it up. You gave up the goose. You, you said thousands of years ago, people thought the Earth was round and they realized it wasn't you just right now you gave them fuel.

Speaker 4:          00:11:34       That's a quote that's going to go on youtube. I am a, she'll quote from the last one. What do you strike that one? A slight misquote. Yeah. So, so yeah. What happened was science basically figured out the shape of the universe. And you know, in the, uh, the 18 hundreds, there was a gentleman scientist doing those courses. All kinds of cool things with stars, like measuring the orbits and checking out how far away things were and discovering that there were galaxies and things like that. You know, there's all this science going on, but then there was this kind of, this guy comes along coal Samuel Robotham who published under the name of Parallax in 18, 60 and he started publishing what is basically the same as Eric debase book that's been published now pretty much every single thing that Eric debase current book you will find in Samuel Rebirth book from 1860.

Speaker 4:          00:12:30       And in fact, if you read the book, which I don't recommend, uh, you will see that about 80 percent of the text book is actually quotes from these books from the scene. Hundreds. It's not actually that this new stuff that he's discovered is all stuff like, you know, if somebody walks away from you, you will see their feet disappeared first. And then he has a two page quotes of Samuel wrote both them saying the exact same thing from the 18 sixties. So it's basically recycling this, this theory that started in the 1860 [inaudible] and then just adding a few little sprinkles to it. Like, you know, saying that as astronauts must be fake and the space station is space. Satellites are fake as well. Yeah, he's hilarious. He thinks that dinosaurs are fake nuclear bombs or fake. I mean there's the idea that one person will be this mastermind that discovers all these monumental frauds.

Speaker 4:          00:13:24       Yeah. And he, he, I don't think he's claiming to discover these things. There's lots of people who think that newco nukes are fake and you know, dinosaurs being fake. It's an obvious thing for creationists and people of that ilk. But uh, yeah, he's, he's basically recycling theories in a way that is popular to the reader and figuring out how to get them across to people. So he, right. It is the youtube videos that are very engaging and they sound good. They sound, if you don't know what's, what they sound like, they make sense. That's the problem. And some of them are quite technical, but at least they use a lot of technical terms. But the, the, the delve into things like, um, uh, there's, there's a variety of experiments. The Michelson Morley experiment, the Eddie mentioned is one of them that keeps cropping up and then there's the, which has never been reproduced.

Speaker 4:          00:14:14       That's the experiment that actually has been reproduced because it's the wrong way, not the way that they wanted the Michelson. Morley, Missouri, the Michelson Morley experiment was an experiment to detect the luminaire forests ether, which is the supposedly medium through which light travels. Now back in the 18 hundreds, we didn't know that the light was made about a photons [inaudible] light was was waived. So we thought that there was this stuff that permeated all a space called the luminesce luminesce, luminesce, ether, luminaire ether. It's a little hard to pronounce and that this is what light travels through as waves going through and didn't know exactly how it works, but the they figured that must be this stuff that permeates all space. And then they figured that since the earth was moving and these scientists actually knew at the time that the earth was moving, so they were using this as a basis for their experiment.

Speaker 4:          00:15:06       They thought that if the earth is moving, then they will be able to detect the ether by doing these experiments. So what they did, they set up this experiment where they shot light one direction and the shorter the other direction. Then when it came back together, it combined and if they were moving through the ether or if the ether was moving through them, then the light that went one way would interfere with the, with the light and went the other way. So that was the, the whole experiment was just just this thing. They shot these two light beams in two directions and they figured like, you know, if we turned the table this way, it will change because we're now going through the ether in different direction. But what happened was nothing was detected, which was kind of the start of people realizing, oh, there is no luminary.

Speaker 4:          00:15:47       Ether use that to say that is because the earth isn't moving. That was what the flatter. But they did. They did. The Michelson and Morley knew the earth was moving. They wanted to figure out whether the ether was moving with the earth or whether the earth was moving through the ether. So they were trying to detect the ether. So people who thought that the earth was the center of the universe, not really so much pellet, flat earthers people who are Geo Centrists, people who thought that the sun went around the earth and the whole all the stars went around the earth and there's still people like the recent resurgence of some of the thing was Gavin mcinnes sent me something or some guy thinks that the earth is the center of the universe. Essentially. He was saying that it sort of confirms everything in Genesis. I was like, what?

Speaker 4:          00:16:38       Yeah, well, I mean if you need to shoehorn a whole universe into the descriptions in genesis, then he probably gonna have to take a few. A few shortcuts. They, yeah. This, these, these experiments like the Michelson Morley experiment and. But people bring them up and they say that what the detector, it was no motion, but what it actually detects your detective was no luminaire for as ether. And because they detected no luminary, luminary burst ether, they eventually led to theories about what light actually is, which is a wave particle duality. You know, the light is photons which act both as a wave and a particle and eventually to the theory of relativity. Well, you started medibank when, when did you, uh, I think it's about five years ago, but I've been doing the chem trail stuff with control science for like over 10 years now. I was just looking at one of my old posts when a satellite images that's quite surprised at how long I've been doing it. Uh, and uh, yeah. And medibank been going about five years and the flat earth stuff came up maybe two years ago. I started to see things about flutter earth and a

Speaker 2:          00:17:50       little bit over a year ago I wrote a post on what, what should we do about debunking the flat earth? And it basically said like, all these people are basically either trolling all the crazy. So there's no point in addressing either of them. And I think most of them are just trolling because no one could seriously believed this. You'd have to be like, I don't think you're right. I know I've come to realize that I'm not. I was wrong. And that, that post, now it's gone down the line, but it's, it's, you know, I've always been one a from that. It's stunning. It really is stunning. It's stunning how many people like this is why Jamie made these young Jamie.com. You can go and get these flatters shell shirts that uh, somehow or another were being paid to say that the earth is round. Like the idea that anybody would actually believe that I've had so many people tweet at me.

Speaker 2:          00:18:38       I know where your checks to come in from, Bro. You're fucking sell out. I'm a sell out. Like why would I give, do you don't think that if I really thought the earth was flat, like if someone thought the earth was flat, what a revelation that would be. What an amazing discovery P, every scientist will be clamoring to expose this. Every single scientist, the idea that all these scientists who make their name off discoveries by the way, especially a monumental and provable discovery, like the world being flat like somehow or another, they would hide that. And then the big question is why would the government say the world is flat? I mean, why would they in any way, why would they rather hide the fact the world is flat? Like what? What motivation would anybody have to show that the world was round who've been pretty fascinating.

Speaker 2:          00:19:17       If we lived on this flat disc and everybody else throughout the universe was in a on a planet, we'd be like, Whoa, what's this? What's going on? And there's a weird thing that's going on with some of these flat earth people where they're linking this to assign that we are in some way special that we are the chosen ones. And that was, you know, in some it keeps going back to genesis and that you know, that we are the children of God and that creation is true. And that evolution is a lie. And it gets to some weird anti juice stuff with a lot of these guys. Yeah. A lot of conspiracy theories basically boiled down to some kind of suspicion of other people. And quite often suspicions of Jewish people. Why Jewish people was always the Jews. It's just people couldn't catch a break.

Speaker 2:          00:20:02       I didn't know exactly why. I think perhaps perhaps because of the, the whole, uh, the Jews killed Jesus Christians don't let the Jews or Christians don't like the Jews. Yeah. So the just being viewed as being an other and they're often near the Jewish. Uh, the broader us population is often like a minority within sitters. So it's an easy person to pick on when things go wrong about that way. I'm sure there's loads of books written by Jews, other subject of conspiracy theorists. Do Bay have a recent video about Jews and about Hitler. They all, they all go down that road. Um, what, what can it be done if anything other than your website? What can be done, if anything to like

Speaker 3:          00:20:48       my, my concern is these young kids that are on the fence, my thoughts are I'm not going to reach out. There's some 45 year old crazy person who is making youtube videos three times a day about the world being flat and ranting and raving and challenging everyone to debates that he's never gonna engage in that. Those guys don't mean anything to me like you can't do anything about them, but there's some 16 year old kids out there that maybe were in highschool and maybe don't have a real formal education in science or astrophysics and they're getting confused and they may be smoke a little too much pot as you motherfucker whoever's listening to this. That's you and you start. It's. I've, I've been tricked before and I wrote this big instagram posts recently about Rod's about those roswell rods. God, they got me. I was convinced.

Speaker 3:          00:21:37       I was convinced, but it was just. I never looked into it. I just watched a documentary and this guy had the footage. I was like, wow, these things are flying around and we can't see them. That's crazy. Yeah, and then a show called [inaudible] if you don't, if you'd never saw the instagram posts that I made. There was a guy that made this video, a documentary. I think you made more than one and it showed that there was these things that looked like tubes that had jelly fish, like wings that were flying through the air. Supposedly it speeds undetectable to the human eye, like they were moving so fast we couldn't see them and so I was convinced man I was really good and then there was a show called monster quest and what they did is they set up two cameras, one camera which was a very fast high speed camera, and the other one which is a standard video camera and the standard video camera caught all these rods flying around and then the exact same images right next to each other with this high definition, high speed camera showed actual bugs. So what those rods were was just a video artifact of these bugs that we're moving so close to the screen and so fast that the camera couldn't register correctly and so it created this elongating effect and made it look like there were these jellies.

Speaker 4:          00:22:49       Fish. Yeah. Well, I think that type of thing, that type of video is the type of thing that needs to be done to counteract this type of

Speaker 3:          00:22:57       work though, because if people aren't looking at the of eight, if they see those images, I put those images up and dude,

Speaker 4:          00:23:04       if you look at them, my instagram posts, it's filled with people angry at me because they think it's fake. They think it's fake. I don't think I'm a shill because I put that up. If you can't get people to look at things that that's a challenge in itself. How do you get people to look at things, but I think like if you start slowly, I do. I engage with a lot of like conspiracy theorists online and I know when I'm doing it I'm not actually going to reach the vast majority of the people. I'm talking directly to that. I know there's lots of other people reading what I'm saying. Who, who will and you know, just because people are complaining about your posts of the create images doesn't mean that there aren't people who actually went to look. Ditto. Oh, I'm sure. Because I think it got like 50,000

Speaker 2:          00:23:46       likes or something like that. So I'm sure even besides people that didn't like it, many people there were like, Oh really? Like is because that was one of the big things that they, the flat earth people kept saying that there's no photos of the earth that aren't a composite from space. Like that's just not true. And they're like this, this Rod's video that you saw with the two cameras. If that hadn't existed, you might have taken a bit longer. Yes to. I mean, you might still believe it now. You might be telling your friends about it. Have you checked seeing these crazy rods that are everywhere. The guy who made that video showed up at a q and a that I did once for the UFC. I do these q and a's where people yell out questions like, what do you think about this guy?

Speaker 2:          00:24:22       That guy, that kind of thing. And uh, he waited in line to get to the front of the line to tell me that I was wrong or that the rods are reelected, like, come on, you still buying it. You're still, he still selling it, they call it, they call them roswell rods. Just hilarious, but they're implying that somehow or another they're alien. Probably some guy was at Rosewell taking pictures, trying to get you fos and some bugs flew by. It wasn't even Rosewell. That's what's funny. They called Roswell Rod. The best footage is from Mexico. The best footage was from a bunch of cave jumpers. You know they have that one really enormous cave, but it's a. it's a whole essentially a gigantic pit and people skydive into it. I've ever seen that. Yeah, I've seen things like that. It's pretty wild. It's pretty wild. But they filmed, they set up a camera to watch them jump off the edge and parachute down and you see the rods flying by.

Speaker 2:          00:25:08       That was like the best footage was from Mexico, from this one place, so it had nothing to do with Roswell. They just called them roswell rods because they're dorks. They probably had to, you know, they were probably looking down the darkness of the pit below and then they had a shaft of sunlight and friends of that. So the books are flying through the sunlight with a dark background, which is something you don't normally see. So it would have been like an unusually good environment for rods to show up in. Exactly, exactly. And it's in that guy, me waiting in line to get to the front of the line. They asked me a question and tell me that, you know, he has the evidence, I need to see it. It's that kind of thinking is once someone commits to an idea, it's very difficult to shake them off of it and they just look for confirmation bias.

Speaker 2:          00:25:50       They just look for someone else to agree with them. They find communities, they find these flat earth communities, which is hilarious. The flat one of the best. One of the best fucking unintentional hilarious things I read online. This dude wrote the flat Earth Society has members all around the globe. Yeah. Whoops. Did he even realized what he was saying or is that just him fucking. I hope it's trolling. Yeah, because the community thing I think is like a key thing. Yes. I, I, I just, I recently did a deep bond of a Ufo that the Chilean navy supposedly saw a, what was that? I'm not aware of that way. It was, it was like this. I'm just thinking that it was a Chilean navy helicopter had this infrared camera and they sold this, this black to black dots off in the distance that looked like a weird thing, like a, like a figure eight type thing flying away. And then it started like spraying out this stuff and they couldn't figure out what was. And they chased after

Speaker 4:          00:26:44       it, but it was too fascinating going away from them. Uh, and the Chilean government has an official UFL investigation team and they, they set them on it and spent two years figuring out what it was and they couldn't figure out what it was. And they said it's a, it's a, uh, confirmed unidentified object. Uh, and then they published their findings and then I, and some other people and medibank looked at it and we figured out that it was actually just a, a plane flying away from the helicopter, leaving some controls behind. We actually figured out exactly what, which plane it was a and so this got this, got a bit of play online and there was unlike Huffington post and things like that and some Ufo enthusiastic, a study talking to me and I joined the groups and I joined a few of the groups and then I find myself in this kind of weird corner of the Internet where everybody believes in Ufo shows, unquestioningly and they're always putting up these photographs of things and people are like, oh, great capture dude.

Speaker 4:          00:27:47       And it's just something like a street light or something. But uh, they, they, they think they had this, this confirmation bias, this group confirmation bias where they can't disagree with someone and they know they're in a safe space. So they can put out whatever theory that they like and they know that people will be like, they're just very supportive of them. By one that happened a couple of days ago, some woman put up a picture of a strange light that she said was in the sky. And so I downloaded the picture and I boosted the brightness. And a story was actually a reflection of a something in a security light on her porch and you could see it was like it was trees behind it and it's a security license is reflection. So I posted that and then I started getting cold, like a shill for pointing this out. A couple of people. I said, Oh yeah, it's just this life. But other people were like, well, why don't you believe me? Why you would like invalidating claims? And so they want to have these kind of walled gardens where everybody believes the same thing. That's a good way to put it.

Speaker 3:          00:28:50       Walled Gardens, it really is a good way to put it because that debt is what those community seemed like. And that's one of the things that I found when I did that television show. I. I still harbored a few conspiracy theories before I did that show, but doing that show for several months and constantly interviewing people who believed in outlandish things. I found the same thing over and over and over again. Illogical people with very little evidence, believing things in almost a religious way. And I found it with bigfoot and I found it with us and I found it with chem trails and I found it with. It was just one after the other in varying stages of ridiculousness. Feel like contrail chem trails where the most nutty people, Ufo people seem to be the most reasonable because it's the most reasonable theory at of all of them.

Speaker 3:          00:29:36       The idea that we have spaceships. Why doesn't someone else have spaceships? There's hundreds of of galaxies in the known universe, hundreds of billions of planets in each galaxy. The odds of there being some sort of a life form out there. It's pretty high, but there's nothing. That's the craziest thing. Like the more I went into, the more I talk to these people, the more I went over all their evidence, air quotes, evidence, the more I asked them why they believe things. There is nothing. There's not a goddamn thing that you can put on a scale. There's nothing that you can way. There's not a thing that you can measure. There's not a thing that you can look at a photo and go, wow, that's compelling. There's not one, they just an idea and that idea is that there's something in this guy that flies around that we either might catch if you're there, the right place, the right time or not, and that they're from another planet.

Speaker 4:          00:30:22       Yeah. I could look at what they put forward as the best evidence is often like snuffing cases from the six days where there's an eyewitness who said something like, there was some guy on a road who says he blacked out and like, you know, his car got messed up from the sixties.

Speaker 3:          00:30:37       Well, that's the other thing that I know too much about psychedelic drugs and I know about indogenous psychedelic drugs. The brain producing this chemical called dimethyltryptamine. That happens when you're sleeping. Now they've proven that this stuff is produced in the liver and the lungs and they believe it's now. They've got evidence that it's produced in the pineal gland is a very potent psychedelic drugs that your brain produces and your brain produces during rem sleep. So these people, they all take naps and during these naps they have these crazy fucking dreams and it's entirely possible that during these dreams what happened is they got some indogenous dmt dump, whether they were under stress or whether they just add just a, an erratic dump of this human neurochemical that entered into their bloodstream. Whatever it is, it caused it all these fucking Ufo abductions, all of them, like almost exactly happened at night. And they happen when these people are sleeping. Like, wouldn't you just assume that you are dreaming? Like why? Why wouldn't you assume you were dreaming?

Speaker 4:          00:31:36       Yeah, I, uh, I have these. I used to have a night terror hallucination things which are kind of like that. Yeah. And it was always the same type of thing. It was like a giant spider coming down from the ceiling to ultimately move. I was frozen for a second and then jump out of bed and turn on the light and look for the spider. And it happened all the time. Like, and I knew because there was no spider that it wasn't real. But I could see if someone was having a different type of hallucination that seemed a bit more real, and then, you know, it may be, it's a, it came in between sleep cycles for them then. Yeah, totally. Yeah. You can see because it seemed completely real. Yeah. I had, I used to have them all the time and it was always like, you know, it was horrible. It was these like giant really realistic spider. And it wasn't like I was dreaming somewhere else. I was in the room and I could see it like I was seeing something crawling across the table right here. It was this hallucination. I don't really get them any more than what it was, uh, you know, my brain is fixed itself or whatever, but it's probably a lot.

Speaker 3:          00:32:35       Do it being young and confused and hormones and nerves. And then also

Speaker 2:          00:32:39       like your brain starts filling in the blanks. You don't have a very good understanding of the universe in your brain. Your imagination runs wild. I, it was very confusing to me doing that television show and it really changed me a lot and it changed me to the point that people started accusing me of being a co opted by the government that the government threatened my family and told me to stop talking about conspiracies like and then the idea that I wouldn't say that if that was the case, like you don't think I would fucking tell everybody if someone threatened my family because it was talking about Ufos, I'd be telling everybody I'd be like, hey man, I would tell all my friends. I'd be like, dude, they fucking threaten me because I was talking about Ufo is this shit is real. Hangar 18, Harry 51.

Speaker 2:          00:33:23       There was a paper a while ago published online how many people it would take to cover up seven conspiracy theories and the probability of none of those people ever talking. Yeah. And it's just ridiculous. Like you can't have tens of millions of people in on a conspiracy. Well, the flat earth one is the best one for that. Yeah, I mean that's. What about those clients? Every single scientist. Yeah, and everyone who is involved in shipping routes and overseas flights and the fact that you can fly west and land east, I mean, you, you, you can, you can just land in one spot, take off again, land in spot, and you could eventually get to the same spot that you're at with a bunch of different flights that you can track them on, on a gps. I mean, it must fight to gps. Oh, that's everything is everything.

Speaker 2:          00:34:10       Yeah. Well, one thing I want to, uh, try to introduce two people who believe in flat earth is this concept that a ground truth, a ground truth as a concept in a satellite observations, which I kind of touched on before. Like you take a satellite observation and you say, does it match what you see on the ground? Or if he goes something like a weather prediction model, predicting the weather you see, does that match what you see on the ground? And this is something that you can do if you're actually really interested in looking into the flight. A theory is figure out what the actual ground truth is. Full something. Now I want to talk very briefly about a program called delirium, which you might've might've seen. It's just basically a solar system simulates, it, shows what's in the night sky. You've probably seen these little, these little, uh, things on your phone where you hold it up and it shows you what the stars are.

Speaker 2:          00:35:01       Yeah, just went like that for the PC. And you can use, use the one on, uh, on your phone as well. So what I would encourage people to do is figure out what is this program actually correct? Is it actually showing me what we see in the night sky? And you can do it really easily. Basically you just look at what's on the screen and then you go outside and you look to see, is this what I'm seeing on the screen here? Uh, so this is basically you checking the ground truth of this program, which seems like a very straightforward thing, but then what you can do from that is you can then use the program to look at the sky from other positions. And

Speaker 4:          00:35:38       because you verify that it's correct for where you are and you can ask someone else to verify it's correct for where they are and you can check like other photographs that have been taken to see if they match up as well. You'll eventually build up, you know the knowledge that this program is correct. This still arion program, all the little program you have in your phone that shows you the stars in the sky. So you've got this computer showing you what it expects to see from any position, any position anywhere on the world and you by doing ground truth observations have figured out. I figured out what it actually is. Yeah. So that's. That's the type of thing you see in delirium. A obviously in a much less light polluted environment than you have here.

Speaker 3:          00:36:16       Do you think that a lot of what's going on with these people that are theorizing and keep that up? That's pretty cool. Look at with a lot of what's going on with these people theorizing about flat earth and there seems to be some desire that people have to expose hidden truths, hidden hidden discoveries or or things that are somehow or another being kept from everybody and the the. What's, what's fascinating to me is they're looking into this nonsense. They're looking into this thing that's not real. When the real space like the actual, like what is observable about space is so mind blowing. Yeah. And somehow or another that is what you absolutely can see every day where you absolutely can observe what you absolutely can read about and learn about and what scientists are discovering on a daily basis is so mind blowing when you see like they don't believe satellites are real. When you see how many satellites we actually have, that's what's really fucked. It's not that there's no satellite. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          00:37:20       Satellites bashing into each other and then uh, we'll have been more centralized there.

Speaker 3:          00:37:25       Thousands of them up there and they have to time, space flights. They have to time space lights based on whether or not they're going to hit these satellites or space junk or some of the stuff that's been ejected from various rocket trips. I mean, it's still floating

Speaker 4:          00:37:39       up there. You seen the movie gravity? Yes. Yeah. This bit in that where the satellite start bumping into each other and it's this big chain reaction eventually. All the satellites. Good. So I didn't get knocked out. Did you see that Japanese express expedition that they tried to. Do they try to capture? I don't know how well it worked that well. I had a really big tether. They were dragging behind it. Yeah. They were trying to like catch a bunch of space junk with a net, right? Yeah. Somehow or another. Yeah. It's amazing. Yeah. This stuff is way more interesting than. Yes. Yeah. That's the real stuff that's really crazy with idea is so it's less. These tiny little thing with the earth is flat and it was stuck in this weird prison where people are keeping us here. Yeah. Yeah. That's the thing too, that somehow or another, by being on a flat planet, it gives you a different perspective and they don't want you to have that perspective, so they tell you the world is round like it doesn't make any sense.

Speaker 4:          00:38:28       Yeah. One thing I've heard is that they think that if they can convince you that the world is flat when it isn't, then it's kind of like in 19 four where they get people to believe that two plus two equals five and they've actually indoctrinate people to genuinely believe that even though they know it's not true, but they still believe it and it's a way of mind control, said the same thing would have happened with the flat earth, but on a far grander scale, you're not just convincing someone that two plus two equals five and war equals peace, et Cetera, et cetera. You're convincing them that the earth is flat when it's actually around. So by doing, by twisting their minds around something that's demonstrably false and making another thing that is correct, then you're gaining power over their minds in the same way that they did in 1984. Right?

Speaker 3:          00:39:15       Well, in the same way the scientologists do or Mormons do or anybody that creates some sort of an ideology that's provably false. I mean, look, there's not a whole lot of difference between scientology and flatter theory. I mean, there really isn't. I mean if you really read l Dot Ron Hubbard's work, if you read what his actual theories were about the origins of mankind, it's pretty fucking loony. And yet there's thousands and thousands of members of scientology to the point where they're making documentaries about it and writing books about it and these people are coming out and they've escaped the church and these harling stories. Man, I had this guy on my podcast a couple of weeks ago. Ronnie miscavige is David miscavige's. Dads want in the sky has been wasted his life can. I lived in the scientology world for 50 years. I mean it's, it's crazy. It's crazy. It is.

Speaker 3:          00:40:02       It is. Not much difference between that and flat earth theory. It really isn't. You know, scientology works like it's like gradually sucks you in a bit at a time, you know, it just sounds all very reasonable at the. It's very self help in the beginning. More and more like the further you get into it, but also the reverse, the first original principles of it. Like when you start thinking positive and doing positive things, there's a lot of benefits to that and people start seeing those benefits. They start feeling positive and then they get into the tetons and the frozen souls chucked into the volcano and they're like, what? Well, I think you could

Speaker 4:          00:40:36       argue that the sim good in the flood earth, not the flat earth theory as such, but the black death way of thinking like questioning things. And I think this is something that people really like about it, is that you don't, you don't, you don't believe scientists just because scientists say something is this thing they called the static method, which basically is a Greek word meaning questioning. So you've got to question everything. You can't believe that gravity exists or pandemic around the scientist because scientist do it. You actually have to observe it for yourself and if you can't absorb it for yourself then it isn't real, which leads people to think the earth is flat because it kind of appears flat from various positions and they haven't been into space or they haven't done the various experiments that show that is not flat. So I think you've got young people who are exposed to the idea of as a techy ism and they think, oh, that's great.

Speaker 4:          00:41:34       You know, I've, I'm rebelling against authority like young people do and they think like, I will not believe. I will not believe the scientists. I'll do my own research, but then they get sucked into people like Dubay who feed them all this nonsense is very articulate and very smooth the way he talks and he makes his well edited videos and they're very compelling. And because he's not an authority, he's not like, you know, part of the government. He's perhaps the, the, the, the old culture. They tend to give his arguments way more weight than mainstream science. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:42:09       Yeah. And then they'll find out something like that New York Times article that was out a couple months back where it showed that scientists from the 19 fifties were paid off by sugar companies to switch the blame to saturated fat and they started attributing all these health problems that were really about sugar and about eating processed sugar start attributed to the saturated fat and it changed a lot of people's diets and really fucked a lot of people up in terms of like, like people started eating margarine and all these things that are filled the trans fats and very unhealthy for you. And they did it because they thought that they were following science. And so questioning science and questioning scientists, you know, occasionally you're right, occasionally you'll find something like this. Yeah. This conspiracy by the sugar industry, you know, there's the old saying, trust yet, verify. Yes. Reagan popularized that with a salt talks.

Speaker 2:          00:42:59       I think yes, that's a very good statement. Trust yet verify. And that's if you want to trust our Dubay that's fine. But like check, check the things that he says. I checked one of his things on the way here on the plane. Uh, he has a thing that a lot of them say, which is the horizon always rises to a higher level. So on the plane, on the way here, I checked to see if there was actually correct. Now, most people when they checked to see if their horizon rises to a level, they just look out the window and they say, Oh yeah, there's the horizon over there. I said high level,

Speaker 4:          00:43:29       but uh, on the horizon is actually going down a little bit when you look out the window of the plane because you're 30,000 feet up in the air. It actually drops around two or three degrees, but it's very hard to see when he was looking at it out of the window of the plane. So it's very easy to get taken into believing that is that it stays at eye level. So what I did is I took this a little carpenters level. He brought a carpenter stuck up into very small one. It's like this like a inch, as long as the, uh, and I've taped some old tube to the top which is like a bit of pen and then I set it level and wedged it so it was level and then I looked through the tube on the top of this level and so wide horizon was and the horizon was just below the end of a level. So the horizon, it actually dropped away, which meant the debates claim about the horizon rising to a level which is something you'd expect on a flight to earth was actually incorrect and it's demonstrably incorrect with this $2 level which actually got free from somewhere and anyone can do this. You don't even need to be in a plane if it works better. If you just like on a cliff or something

Speaker 3:          00:44:32       like a thousand feet up. Well that's another claim that people keep saying that or divo tease this flat earth idea that that if you get on a plane and you look up and you look out the window, it looks flat. But I do not think that people understand perspective and they do not understand how huge the earth is when you see there's images, someone did an image that showed how far you are up when you're 30,000 feet in the air and then how, how like huge the earth actually is, and you get this like little image of a plane at 30,000 feet and then the dot of the plane is represented in the, the amount of distance between the earth is in perspective. And then you see how enormous the planet is and it's just, you're dealing with something that's so big. It's almost, I mean, it feels like it's flat. It feels like it's flat because it's enormous in your tiny.

Speaker 4:          00:45:27       Yeah, that's, that's a huge issue with people is that they don't really understand the scale of the planet and they don't understand how little it actually curves. Uh, those. There's, uh, road. Uh, if you look, if you look up like the longest roads in America, longest straight road in America, there's, this road is in like Oklahoma or somewhere and it's about 80 miles long and it's just perfectly straight. But it actually isn't perfectly straight because when they laid it out, they laid it out along a line of latitude, so it's one of the lines that goes around around the earth. So it's actually slightly curved. When you look at it, it looks perfectly straight. You have to actually like take their whole image and then draw a line from one end to the other in google earth and you see that it deviates by just these tiny little amount. But if you were to drive along this road, you're actually driving around. You're actually turning right slightly the whole time. But it looks perfectly straight because it's hardly moving. It's old over these 80 miles. It moves maybe like 10 feet or something. And you know, people just don't, don't, don't realize just how small the curve of the earth actually is. It looks flat

Speaker 3:          00:46:34       and again, and again, I think a real big problem with this theory and with a lot of these theories, a lot of these really outlandish conspiracy theories is once they hook you, it's very difficult to unhook yourself. You, you don't want to believe that you got taken. You don't want to believe he'd been had. You don't want to believe you've been fooled, so you keep going deeper and deeper down the rabbit hole and you keep finding more and more confirmation bias. More people inside that walled garden as you put it.

Speaker 4:          00:47:01       Yeah, and some people actually go out and do scientific experiments and they try reasonably hard. Some of them, but then they make some kind of mistake and then they say, this is actual proof that the earth is flat. Like those. The level experiment that I did, someone did something similar with that is that they use like a water level where you have two tubes connected and you use the, the, the level of the water because the water level's the same on both of them and then they hold this up and see if it was below the horizon. But they did this experiment and they did it at sea level, which meant is always going to be exactly the same as the horizon. You've actually got to go up a thousand feet before you can see anything, but they still, you know, even even though they, they, they thought that they were doing some science, but they make this one key mistake and then they weren't listened to anybody trying to tell them what the mistake actually was.

Speaker 4:          00:47:47       A people this a ridiculous amount of people doing flat earth experiments on youtube and just getting it completely wrong. I think the most common one is people taking photographs or something that they shouldn't be visible from a certain position. Like they'll say like, here's a catalina island and it's like 60 miles away and according to the curvature of the earth, that means it should been below five miles of curve. Uh, and so it shouldn't be visible. And then there's all these mistakes that they make. Some of them are like, they, they do the math wrong. Some of them, like they don't account for the fact that you've got a, you know, a, a factor in how high the viewer is. Or some of them will just, they'll get entirely the wrong island. Like they'll say like, oh, this is this island, which is just layer 100 miles away in the right.

Speaker 4:          00:48:36       You're looking at something that's 40 miles away. Well, how can we can look out in the. I mean, here's a simple one. How can we look out across the ocean? You don't see anything on the side. Yeah. Like what's over there? Well, so far away that you can't see it. They got an out there. They're got out though because the, uh, you wouldn't get to see anything away because of the atmosphere. So thank you. I'm going to say three things. Get further away. They get fainter and fainter islands that they believe in the atmosphere. They do and they use it a lot to make up reasons for certain things like, like things going on below the horizon and that's where it gets weird, right? It's that people use some science to try to debunk science or things that they claim a science, like the lore of perspective perspective isn't, doesn't exist.

Speaker 4:          00:49:15       There's no law of perspective. I mean, if you were to make a lower perspective, you could say that the size of something decreases inversely proportional to its distance, so if it gets twice as far away, it's half the size. If it gets four times as far away, it's a quarter of the size and that's it and that's, that's all that perspective is. Now. People talk about vanishing points. Well, that came up during the podcast with Eddie Bravo. Yeah, and Jamie brought it up and then Eddie started posting pictures on his instagram of a guy from the early 19 hundreds who is an artist who wrote something about the law perspective in drawing, just drawing. He was just explaining how you, how you define perspective when you're illustrating things. That's, that's the lower perspective on a piece of paper, on a photograph. It's nothing at all to do with the real world. It's about what you can, what you can see visually, what the image is projected onto your eyes or what comes through a camera when you take a picture, you know, what's the actual perspective of things. You know, things just get smaller, but it says it sounds good. When you say the law perspective, it sounds good, like you're invoking a law scientific, but then they will discuss a real law like the law of universal gravitation. Yeah. I just, again, I don't have

Speaker 3:          00:50:28       anything against Eric do pay or any of these people. I really don't. My real concern is with young people out there that are listening to this that get sucked into this stupid shit and there's a soul much that you could learn. There's so much that's fascinating about the university, so it's fascinating about the natural world. There's so much to learn and to waste anytime. The only thing that's good about it is you'll recognize the pitfalls that the human mind can slip into that I've slipped into that many people I know have slipped into. And again, it's not a, it's not a like in any way, shape or form. It's not something to be embarrassed about or sad about. It's just, it's a normal natural human inclination to try to find things that are hidden truths or you know, that are covered up mysteries. It's natural for whatever reason,

Speaker 4:          00:51:16       I think it's very much a part of growing up and I think it's just a, it's different for different people. I had a whole bunch of crazy ideas when I was growing up. What'd you have a. I thought I could bring about world peace by getting a whole bunch of world leaders together and uh, I actually sent letters to a bunch of world leaders and I figured like I shouldn't send it directly to the world leaders because there'd be a, it'll be a bit. Yeah, they will want to read my letters. So I sent it to the brothers. So I sent a letter to, to Raul Castro who is now a the president of Cuba, but back then I thought, well I can, I can set up this organization of the relatives of world leaders and bringing about will piece now. It's that like I was like 13 at the time that you decided to get ahold of their brothers.

Speaker 4:          00:51:58       That's kind of hilarious. Yeah, well I think it like a sneaky backdoor. Yeah. And I found his address in a WHO's who in the library back in the day, back in the day when you look things up in the library. Yeah. I mean, that's not even that unreasonable. That's like you thinking, well, world piece seems to make sense to me. This idealistic child, uh, and you know, you want to try to do something and you think you can, you think you can make a difference and you can add rebelling against things. I had delusions of solving great mathematical problems when I was young. Those like, you know, problems like how do you try sex and angle with a by this geometrical methods which was proved to be impossible to do. And yet I still spent months and months trying to do it when I was a kid because I thought that can't tell me what's possible and what's not possible. It seems like it's possible to me. And if you did discover it, what a gigantic it would have been feather in your cap. That would have been. That was the motivation really. It wasn't just like pure altruism. I wanted to,

Speaker 3:          00:52:57       I believe in a bunch of stupid shit and the big one for me that I've clung to longest has bigfoot. That one man. Oh, it's so hard for me to let that one go because. Well, first of all, because it used to be an animal, needs to be gigantic pithy guess, but man, when my friend Les Stroud actually started doing that show, that bigfoot show, have you ever seen that show? And I don't think so. I did that show with some fucking

Speaker 2:          00:53:26       guy who's just a total hoax or and the guy put on a big foot mask and they got this high resolution photo and video of this big foot mask that they're claiming is big foot to staring at them through the woods. It is so stupid looking CV and finally Jamie and this guy, this is our wacky. This guy is the bigfoot community. Thinks he's full of shit. That's when you know you fucked up when the big foot community is calling shenanigans, they're like, this guy. I'm not buying this as spending. You get these schisms in this community, so they fracture off into sub communities. The scientologists, there are people who have purchased from the scientologists watch this. This is awesome. See is guys in the woods and he sees it. He sees it's through the trees. What is it? Where is it? And he can't.

Speaker 2:          00:54:09       It's not even moving. Meanwhile, bigfoot's just been running from people from day one. Right? But there's one animal is just standing there and he's like, God, I think I see it. I think I said. So then towards the end of the video, he gets really close, like looking at it. The fuck out of here is Galligan Afro from the Nineteen Seventies. Like, look how clean it's hair looks. I mean, it looks so dumb. It's not moving. No, he gets close up on it. Look at that. Isn't that wink or something? Oh yeah. Here it is. Look, look how bad this is bad. This is. Here's the this. Here's how you know it's fake. Whenever something looks like a dude in a monkey suit, it's a dude in a monkey suit. That's all you need to know because your brain knows. Your brain's like, Hey, wait a minute. Like if you look at a gorilla, gorilla doesn't look like a person in a gorilla suit.

Speaker 2:          00:54:54       Feel good a giraffe. It does not look like a person in draft suit. Feel like a big foot and it looks like a dude in a monkey suit. It's a fucking dude. The monkey suit, like your brain starts filling in the blanks and also whether you recognize it or not, your brain recognize, recognize geometry. Facial geometry recognizes a FIBONACCI sequence. Hogwash. Yeah. And you see, that's why people freak out when you see someone fake lips or fake nose upside down and things like that when, when people do weird shit to their face, like when someone, um, get the plastic surgery in the face and they like radically altered their face, it's jarring to us. And one of the reasons why it's jarring is because the brain recognizes geometry and human facial recognition or facial patterns and the structure of the face. And when that geometry is off, it's confusing to us.

Speaker 2:          00:55:38       Like why are their cheeks so big? Why is that? No so small? Why are the lips so big? Like what the fuck is going on? It's like your body starts to react to it. Yeah, there's an illusion with a put two sets of eyes on people and you look at that and you just. Your brain just is constantly resetting and you go my eyes across the way or another. You frightened just so hard wired to recognize faces. Yes. That it just automatically recognize faces in your face and my face are different, but there's a science to you or the structure of your face that's applied to the science. My face, and that's the golden ratio. I mean if you, if you look at a person's face, you can actually do the math where their chin is, where their eyes are. It all lines up and your brain recognizes when that's not the case. So if you see that and you see like, oh a person, what the fuck's

Speaker 3:          00:56:24       going on? Because it is a person that's a person that's a dude in a monkey suit. It's not even a good one and there's so many people that tried out that Patterson footage, which is so bad. Yeah, they, they, they believe so hard. They believe so hard. It's the hardest one for me to realize that those people were all full of shit because when I was a kid, man, God, I don't want a big foot to be real. That was a, that was a tough one. Tough one to let go and plus it was a real animal at one point in time there was really a thing called [inaudible], which was an eight to 10 foot tall, if it may have been by people at least occasionally.

Speaker 4:          00:57:00       Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's A. Yeah, you want things to be true like Ufos. I was going to a Ufo is and all kinds of weird stuff on it when I was younger and I think partly like me figuring out the. A lot of it was just bullshit was part of the buddy for getting into like debunking stuff later, but at a certain degree I think there's no harm in people believing in things like you know, little kids believe in Santa Claus, etc. That type of things rather christmas, easter bunny, and it's just that for some people it kind of goes a bit wrong because a bit too far they don't let the child is beliefs drop away as they get older or they stay longer or when they come of age they go into that kind of the next level of disbelief, of imaginary things that they wanted to be true and a lot of that boils down to what we're talking about earlier, the distrust in authority, like people, you know, distrust of others, and the belief that there's some secret cabal of people doing things to them. The illuminati. Yeah. So I think it's partly this kind of a natural, childish wanting to believe in things which we all have. We all believed strange things when we were young and I think that aliens in a lot of ways, they're like a cosmic daddy. The idea that there's someone who's really on the ball that's watching us and you can make sure we don't fuck everything up. That's where this content movies are so popular. Just the idea of like, oh, aliens coming to help us or whatever is so, so enticing. It'd be so amazing.

Speaker 3:          00:58:27       Yeah. Meanwhile, I think the movie alien is probably more likely. What's gonna happen? Just come down here and fuCk us up. I'm the weird thing about the ufo community and the big foot community and all these different communities is that along the line they become people that make a living at it and they become, you know, air quotes experts and that that becomes a problem because then they have a vested interest in making sure that other people believe they start writing books, thEy start doing lectures, they start showing pictures. And also here's what's interesting as the number of phones that have cameras have radically increased. The number of usable ufo pictures is radically decreased. Yeah. Which doesn't make sense.

Speaker 4:          00:59:10       Was like this one got 83 times. Zoom on it. You can take pictures of if there was a ufo, you can take a real close up picture of I take patients on planes all the time, the flying five away or 10 miles away or sometimes even like, you know, every 100 miles away and you can make out the plane. You see the windows a. Yeah, depending on the angle. That's the claim that they can trail is put out sometimes at the planes don't have windows, which is generally that a generally because they using these crappy little cameras and you just can't see the windows got the less than one pixel wide. Right. If you've got a good camera and use zoom in far enough, the windows appear kind of like, you know, things appearing over the horizon when you zoom in the. Speaking of this camera, this suddenly coming up in august, which is the eclipse, uh, there's gonna be a total eclipse of the sun over north America, I think August 21st this year.

Speaker 4:          00:59:59       And I think that's, that would be a great opportunity for people to encourage anybody who believes in the earth to actually start looking at, you know, the what's going on. Don't they have any excuse for that though? He hadn't like how are they, how are they going to justify it by eight? They actually look at it. I think the challenge is getting people to look at things. The excuse the excuse. The reason we're giving them is that there's an eclipse and everybody wants to look at the eclipse because it's an amazing thing. The moon goes in front of the sun and blocks the there. Yeah, but I think that you're giving them too much credit. I think all someone has to do is make a youtube video with some wonky explanation for why an eclipse works and then it works because the earth is a disk and the sun gets below the disc and it blocks it out from below.

Speaker 4:          01:00:39       I mean, it just doesn't seem to me that it's. It's enough. This is a like a solar eclipse though. They finished. They can tell that the moon is going in front of the sun because I know what you're saying is logical, but you know, even the flight others believed that the moon goes in front of the sun for a solar eclipse. Yeah, because they can. You can track the position of the moving through the sky and they know that, you know, he gets closer to the sun every, every time. don't they believe that the earth's sits flat and then everything spins around the earth. The earth is flat and the, uh, the sun a sun and the moon are orbiting above like this. But you know, sometimes the moon is going to be below the sun and it blocks out the light of the sun.

Speaker 4:          01:01:17       And that's how an eclipse happens on the earth and on the rounder. So it will be an amazing thing to see even if you're a flat earth believer, this, this very rare coincidence when the moon is in front of the sun. So I usually encourage people who have flat earth believers to look at this amazing thing that's happening. Uh, they still don't give a fuck. Is there, is there a uniformity in the flat earth community and they like all greed or is there a dissension? There's some people say, you know, that it's because the ice wall. No, there's no fucking ice wall just to drop off and everybody dies. There is kind of like, you know, this mainstream thing where the dubay model of things, it's kind of like in the chem trail community, you know, you've got this one guy, a dane wigington who's this really popular guy and then you've got like a bunch of other patients.

Speaker 4:          01:02:05       one is he, is he the guy that made that, uh, the videos, uh, now that was michael. James murphy was the guy that guy was, he was a little loony and, and, uh, wigington is the guy who lives in a big house on 200 acres up in the mountains somewhere. And uh, he got obsessed with the solar panels being blocked by contractors and so began the counter, I'll believe it, but he, he's like the equivalent of dubay. Rarely because he's the guy who was really promoting it. But then there's other people in the country, the community who are, uh, doing their own thing and they say, yeah, we can send guy's full of crap because he believes in global warming and we don't. So there's this, there's this division between people who believe in global warming and who don't. So there's some people I think that chem trials are trying to stop global warming and other people think that chem trails are causing global warming.

Speaker 4:          01:02:54       And then there's other people that think that's kim kendrick was something completely different. This spreading nano robots to control people's minds and things like that. You've got the same type of range of things in the flat earth believers as well. Like you. Some people think that the earth is kind of concave and it's not actually flat at all. What about the hollow earth people? So the earth is hollow. That's, that's not even, that's not really a flatter thing that's like around us with a hole in the top and a whole new world in there. People live on the inside of the earth, which makes even less sense than the data from a physical point of view. While they think there's monsters in there. Yeah. What were those aliens? The rothschilds they think their lizard people. They live under the earth. Yeah. Lasers make tunnels. You've heard that.

Speaker 4:          01:03:38       Yeah. Yeah. It sounds. Sounds real. Yeah. I'm looking into it. Any, any, any conspiracy theory is going to have a range of a plausibility. Yeah. From reasonably plausible to completely implausible, like you think of some of the. A nine slash 11 conspiracy theories. Like at one end you've got like the. The world trade center was destroyed by nuclear bombs that were in the basement. Nuclear bombs, nuclear bombs. People think that. Yeah, I haven't heard that one now. It's a fringe one, but it's got a few people who believe it. Then there's people who think a bit bit more plausible. They were destroyed by energy. Weapons from space. Like there was these beams of energy like high powered microwave or something that blew the buildings up and then this know you get more and more plausible. Those pre planted explosives or some guys running there on the day with some explosives to blow building seven, and then you've got just, they let buildings haven't burned when they didn't have to.

Speaker 4:          01:04:34       And then then they got, they, they knew it was going to happen, but it did nothing about it. And then they had some warnings about it and they didn't do anything about it. So you got this whole range of plausibility for the conspiracies, uh, with the flat earth. It's pretty much all of this end because the flush, her theory is that the earth is flat or it's round. So with the flesh of you, you've only got a very extreme. And then more extreme theories. Uh, some of the most, the most extreme thing which we, all conspiracy theories ended up with is the, uh, everything is an illusion. We're living in the matrix. A conspiracy theory or that theory is very compelling that, that is very bizarre because

Speaker 2:          01:05:18       one day if technology continues the way it has been, there will come a time where they able to create an artificial reality that's indiscernible from this reality. As long as we don't blow ourselves up and technology continues to advance, innovation continues to advance at the rate it is now, which is exponential, right? It's entirely possible that a hundred years from now or whatever it is, they'll be some way that they can interface with your somehow with your brain and create some sort of an artificial experience. Right? That's not outside the realm of prospect theory is that doing it now and it's detectable that these things that we are seeing, I kind of artifacts or living in the matrix, you might have heard of the mandela effect. Yes. As you know, the people who believe that this kind of glitches in the matrix, like the berenstein bears, berenstein bears are actually called the bear steinbeck as a and an alternate timeline.

Speaker 2:          01:06:13       Oh, there was this movie, a cold shazamm, uh, done by. Well, I can't remember the guy's name now. People say sinbad. Sinbad. Khazan. Yeah. Mixed fleet. They completely believe that this actually happened, but that is, it is. It is. But they believe it. So that's, that's something that's at the end of all, all these conspiracy theories. That's not a very reasonable one, but there's some really reasonable scientists that believe that there's going to come a time where the elon musk. Yes, believes that. Yeah. Yeah. I, I not really convinced myself because it's kind of a simplistic argument saying that yeah, technology will always advance and get better. There are fundamental limits on information theory. Like how much information that we can process. Have you ever messed around with um, a htc vive or any of the more recent state of the art? Now they're mindblowing, mindblowing. And this is one of the reasons why I subscribed to it.

Speaker 2:          01:07:12       I mean, not today, but I mean, I think one day in the future, whether there's 100 years or whatever it is of technology. I mean, you just got to think 150 years ago they were using teletypes to date. That was the only way to get a medicine message across, you know, um, and then what can we do today? We can take a film and send it to someone in Australia. They get it in real time. I think it's very reasonable to assume that if you put on the htc vive, they have this one underwater experience. It's amazing. Jamie scene, if you could find it, because I know it's in video form, but I think it's reasonable it on. There's going to be extremely realistic things that make you think that you are there. Yes, but I don't think it's realistic that you would be able to not detect that a scientist wouldn't be able to detect that, that we are all living in a simulation. Is this simulation just just you? Is it just your head to see this right here? This is. You put this thing on. I mean again, yeah. We're in 2017 and this is all and it's fairly fairly adolescent stage and man, when you're, when you're in this thing and you're looking around, it's not necessarily high definition. It's, it's, it's very clear

Speaker 3:          01:08:17       and you know that it's not real, but god, it gives you this feeling that it's real and then a whale pulls up and all these fish swim by. It's. It's amazing and it more than anything, it gives you a window into the future. It gives you a window when you sit next to this whale and it makes noises and the noises are all three d. It gives you a window when you start thinking about pong, remember pong game that you would play. It was like, I can't believe I'm controlling something on the television to to to, to, to, to, to do it. Then you compare that to like halo and the games you can play right now and an xbox and was like my god, like the improvements are radical and I think that the improvements in this sort of artificial reality, this virtual reality that you're seeing in this

Speaker 2:          01:09:00       current htc vive 100 years from now, I would only imagine that we could get to a point where it's indiscernible that somebody I next to you. Really. That's great. That's why lie. Look at that. That whale, the whale is a living thing. It's made up of cells. You could take one cell from that whale and you could put it under a microscope and you could dissect it and you could look at the cell and everything that say, okay, we're having a different argument here. I'm, I'm thinking that it's going to feel real. You're saying scientists will be great, I believe. I believe you won't be able to. You will be able to. I don't believe that they could make something that you could not detect. I'm not text with science cripple the cripple your intelligence, so you're away from it. They'll be able to make something that's indiscernible like while you're experiencing it, it's like you would a scientist could come along and check it.

Speaker 2:          01:09:51       It's a bit of a philosophical question though because like you know, what we have now is our observable universe with the laws of physics. I don't think within this universe you could make something that stimulates the universe that's the same because there's just too much information in the universe to be stimulated by something that is within the universe or even something like as small as like the the earth. I don't think you could simulate the entire earth in our physical universe, not now. You don't think you could do it a thousand years from now? Yeah, really good thing. So I think there are fundamental limits as to how much information will be required. You could get something that's a, a, an imitation of that, but it will be detectable different. Like each. Each simulation is going to be lower fidelity than the universe that created it. Right?

Speaker 2:          01:10:40       So you can only create something that's less complex than the universe you have currently in. Is that true though? I mean as time moves on 5,000 years from now, whatever it is, I mean, how could anyone possibly discern or how could you even guess and estimate how far it would advance? You go back 5,000 years ago, people were modern humans, you know? I mean the people that built the pyramids. So we're modern humans, right? They, they looked like us. Maybe a little smaller. They didn't get as much to eat. They look just like us. If you went 5,000 years in the future, it's not. It's not unreasonable if we don't blow ourselves up that you would, that we would have some sort of quantum computing, some astronomically powerful devices that could render and create an artificial reality that felt to you entirely real. I don'T think that's outside the realm of possibility, but could you then create within that universe the same quantum computers that are stimulating yourself?

Speaker 2:          01:11:31       So I think that that's kind of a paradox really. It has to be as powerful as the thing that is simulating it. I don't think so. I think artificial intelligence is gonna lead us to a well, if You can create something that's artificial intelligence, right? Which we feel like is going to happen way quicker than 5,000 years from now. If you create SomethIng that's artificially intelligent, it's going to improve upon. It's designed almost instantaneously. It's going to realize like if you've given autonomy. Yeah. We don't know what's gonna happen, right? Quantum computers. We don't know how well they're going to work. That it could be a dud because could be fucking amazing. Could be fucking amazing. Yeah. Who knows? It's something to think about, but when when scientists start thinking that we are currently living in some sort of computer simulation, I don't discard it.

Speaker 2:          01:12:17       I'll give it a pause. I mean I don't, I don't subscribe or not subscribed to something as ridiculous as that because it seems to me within the realm of future possibility, yeah, it's, it's kind of like it's a thought experiment because like if we are the simulation, we were not going to figure it out when we're not going to have to do anything about it if we do figure it out. Right, right, right. Yeah. A thought experiment and the scientists are looking at the laws of physics. If they keep drilling down far enough, maybe eventually they'll discover like the some kind of artificial substrate to the universe, which is all ones and zeros and that we are actually living in some kind of simulation, but that's just basically as resolving the laws of physics and more, you know, if we get down that deep, what can we.

Speaker 2:          01:12:59       We can't do anything about it. Well, not only that, does that actually mean that we are living in some sort of an artificial realm or does it mean that that's what the universe is made of? It's not artificial, but that the universe, much like what we're creating like that the universe is almost fractal and much like what we're creating when we're creating these artificial environments at the universe itself is made out of ones and zeros and then this whole thing is really mathematical. Yeah. And that just because we haven't been able to detect it up until now, it doesn't mean it hasn't been running on some sort of a, some sort of a uber complicated mathematical principle. Yeah. I think he's kind of a moot point in a Way because like what's important is what are the laws of physics and you know, can we, can we detect what's actually running the laws of physics? Yeah. So yeah, it's, it's a philosophical question. What mental masturbating. Yeah. It seems to me that that's a thing that people do, and I think we could bring it back to this flat earth thing, is that people love to go down these honey holes of of information and have a debate and ideas and whether it's bigfoot or ufos, we love to chase ourselves chasing our own tail when it comes to these bizarre subjects

Speaker 3:          01:14:11       that that may or may not be real and most likely aren't real. We love to chase and become like engrossed in these things and I wonder why we're doing it. I wonder if we're distracting ourselves. you know? I mean, it doesn't seem to be people that are fully happy with their life that really get into this kind of stuff that really go all in and balls deep. You don't. You don't get a guy who has lIke a promising career. He's at the top of his field. Happy family, great friends, great hobbies, loves his law, and then it just becomes a ufo and that doesn't seem to be the case. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          01:14:47       You still got these pool players who believe they're not doing so good. It's hard out there for a pool player right now. The guys at the top of the game is there, the teacher, I think those guys just watched too many fucking youtube videos and they don't have any science. Most of pool players. One of the things about what's that common expression about pool players. if someone plays pool really well, it's the glorious results of a misspent youth because it takes a long time to learn how to play pool really well and you're not going to be doing that while you're, you know, got your nose buried in physics books. I think like people like things like the, that they, that they get things out to them, they're getting something out of it is giving them purpose in their life. It's like, you know, he's kind of like a hobby in a way.

Speaker 4:          01:15:24       Like you just doing something because you enjoy doing it. Like playing chess. Yeah. Except along with that hobby of doing stuff. They actually have a belief. There's is required for them to actually do their hobby and they don't obviously think of it like that, but that's essentially what it is. They have these activities that they like doing, like gardening or whatever, but it requires them to believe that the earth is flat, so they're spending all that time, uh, like making youtube videos about how the earth is flat or doing their experiments about how the earth is flat and that they're getting something out of it because it's the little hobby. I do The same thing except I'm actually doing it for science. Like I do these fun little experiments like on the, on the plane today I was on the plane, like wedged up against the window looking for, with this holding my camera up against it and the woman next to them. So I thought I was this crazy guy. You should have told you that the earth isn't flat, ma'am. she probably thought that I was thinking to the earth was flat. I've seen other people on youtube that bringing levels onto the plane and they're like, hey, look for the level isn't moving well if you work

Speaker 3:          01:16:26       day and you have an eight hour day plus commute plus family plus whatever bills and issues that you have to deal with. And then you get into one of these youtube videos, you simply, you simply don't have the time to really explore all of the possibilities and all the science behind all of the arguments. and it's just.

Speaker 4:          01:16:46       Yeah, I think what happens is either they, you know, they get this superficial understanding of the conspiracy theory, uh, or the, the actual real life suffers. A lot of people get sucked into conspiracy theories like, like chem trails or nine slash 11 truth. And they become socially isolated and they become the, they get divorced and they lose custody of the children.

Speaker 2:          01:17:10       Happens all the time. Yeah. And this, this isn't like, you know, he's not like the government punishing them or anything like that. It just because they become obsessed with something that is outside of societal norms and they feel this overwhelming, compelling need to tell other people about it. Yeah. And they talk about, oh yeah, people roll their eyes when I bring up the subject of controls or the flat earth. And of course they do. But yeah. But from their point of view, they're trying to wake up other people they're doing, they're doing the lord's work by giving the truth to people. But then there's some theories that are really compelling, like when you look into like operation northwoods and you find out that the government really was planning false flag attacks and it didn't work out as sex saturated. I now it's not. How's exaggeration? Well, the, it was a discussion document signed by the joint chiefs of staff.

Speaker 2:          01:18:00       Uh, it's a, it was rejected by a candidate, by candidate, by the joint chiefs of staff very far. It was just one documents. They signed it though they got it. They didn't sign you that they wanted to do it, but it was an idea, the idea that you were going to attack american civilians, that you were going to arm cuban friendlies and attack one tunnel, that you're going to blow up a drone, airliner. These were all proposed things. They will propose things. Yeah. But it was just like, you know, but you can understand. I understand what you're saying, but spit balling that you're going to deceive the american people and kill american civilians, and then this is a normal part of the way nero burned rome. HiTler burned, burned. The reichstag that false flag attacks are real and that they have happened throughout history. So when you do have an open mind and you are compelled to try to seek the truth, you got to be aware that these things have happened in history.

Speaker 2:          01:18:48       They are real and if you dismiss everything, you'll be thought of as a shill, as much as I mean as much as people who look for conspiracies and everything. There are also people who try to dismiss everything and you have to be very careful because there are a lot of things that people do conspire to do. Like one of the things that I brought up before and people hate when I talk about this, but I'm going to do it again. Uh, people say I don't believe in conspiracy conspiracy's. And I said, you don't believe in any conspiracies? No. Okay. Do you believe nine slash 11 happened? I do believe that people flew planes into jet blue jet planes into buildings. Well then you believe in conspiracies because someone can aspire to do that. And they did it. They pulled it off. a bunch of people got together, decided they were going to attack.

Speaker 2:          01:19:32       They flew a plane into the pentagon. They flew two planes into the world trade center towers. I mean that really happened. So that's a conspiracy and they pulled it off. So when you debunk all of these things that are absolutely false, like flat earth and chem trails and ufo is and all that Jazz, you got to be careful to not try to debunk everything because now people are saying, I just think like, I personally just feel the northwest thing is a bit overblown. I don't it what it was. I think it speaks volumes about what the mindset of the joint chiefs of staff for one example. And a good one though. Yeah. But they didn't come up with any others.

Speaker 4:          01:20:08       Um, what about what got us into Vietnam? Gulf of tonkin. Yeah. That was a false flag. Well, that's debatable too, because that was just basically they thought that they were being attacked. Nothing. Debatable. Yeah. I think that's pretty much been agreed upon the flag. It was a series of events led. There was the, it didn't happen to over two nights the report of the boats being fired upon a. And it turns out that probably wasn't anything there. Right. So it's debatable is, did they think there was something there and they wanted to be. So did they completely invented out of thin air right now? Probably used it as a pretext to, uh, to uh, start the Vietnam war. Uh, but they just took advantage of it. learn the same way the bush took advantage of the nine slash 11 attacks to push his agenda. Now, is that a conspiracy? It's hard to say like what knowledge did bush have of the nine slash 11 attacks beforehand? We know he took advantage of it and we know that, uh, you know, the, uh, the american administration back then took advantage of the gulf of tonkin reports. We don't know for sure whether the gulf of tonkin reports were fabricated or how much they were fabricated or what actually happened on that night. Uh, and uh, but we do know that they were taken advantage of. Yeah. Well,

Speaker 2:          01:21:35       uh, my, my whole point is that you have to be careful when you, a person who debunks things that are legitimately ridiculous, that you have to take into consideration the possibility that people do conspiring to do things. Totally. They do. Yes. If that's happened within pretty high levels of government with enron, I mean there's this and there's been a ton of conspiracies that turned out to be true and that's what they arms very ryan the Iran contra scandal. I probably went to all the way to the top. Oh yeah. Reagan probably knew all that. That was where it was hilarious when it was, when reagan was showing the first signs of alzheimer's, when he didn't remember, he didn't remember anything and people were like, oh, he's lying. And it turns out no, and he's actuallY memories really eroding. The community was an older man. I Mean, he's in his late seventies at the time, wasn't he?

Speaker 2:          01:22:23       Yeah. Yeah. He was a trump sage. I think jesus christ trump. There was a fucking hilarious article about trump today that he doesn't believe in exercise because he believes that the body has a finite amount of energy in it and then when you exercise you use up that energy and that's why he has so much energy because he doesn't exercise. He has strange diets. Like he has his steaks. Well done and he likes to eat lunch meat straight out of the fridge, but It's not the head of the show. Sure. He's a very nice guy. Are you never met the guy? Yeah. He doesn't look healthy, but he's got a lot of energy, man. Kind of amazing. How much energy he has. Alex jones. Yeah, he did. Well, he kind of looks reasonably healthy. Guess he's not healthy? No, no. Alex hasn't looked at healthy. He's overweight and he's, uh, he's younger than me. like I was used to freak out that he's younger than me. I was like, oh, you're younger than me. I keep just goes hard. Alex goes hard all the time, you know, and now it takes a toll. Well, it's also, I mean, constantly worrying that the government's after you and that there's, you know, every fucking turned he take has a conspiracy behind. It's the mind can only take so much pressure.

Speaker 4:          01:23:33       Yeah. Yeah. Cool. Should we talk about some of flood of that stuff? Sure. What else you get out there? You've got notes. I do. I read everything I could think of on the fly to which is a shit load of stuff. Uh, the international space station. Oh, that's a good one. Yeah. I think that that footage is fake. They think it's all fake, but what you can do is you guys, you can get back to the skylab footage and ask someone who believes in flat earth how they faked the skyline footage because this footage of skylight with people like, you know, they're running around and running around in circles in zero gravity, as long sequences of people doing stuff in zero gravity and it's in a space that's actually too big to fit in any, any plane that's ever been built. So it couldn't be filled, filmed in a thing Where they do the vomit comet. Yeah. It has to be something that was actually a zero

Speaker 2:          01:24:21       for people don't know what that is. When, when you see scenes in movies where someone was moving in zero gravity, they would film that in a plane that would literally be, tHey would get the plane up to like 40,000 feet or whatever and then they would just literally shoot down so that you're kind of going faster down than gravity and you could float around. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          01:24:42       So this is zero gravity here. Yeah. Running around in circles and they do all kinds of stuff like that. You get three of them running and this is the space that they're in. There is, is so big that it wouldn't fit in. Like you probably wouldn't even fit in the beluga thing that they use for transporting a planes. But it ties us back to area 51 because there's some giant airplanes that they make an area 51. They used to simulate zero. Yeah. I mean it's obvious that this isn't space. Yeah. And this is like from the seventies. Yeah, pretty amazing, but the space station, the international space station, it flies over at regular intervals and this is not one of the ground truth things that I was talking about earlier. You can see it, you can look up when it's going to fly over. You can get them to send you a list.

Speaker 4:          01:25:23       There's a cycle spot the station as a nasa site, uh, but you don't have to trust it, but you can still sign up and it will tell you when the space station is going to fly over to the second. He'll tell you to the second one it's going to appear and how, how, how, how it will be and how long it'll be visible for. And you can get to send you an email and then get your camera out and take photographs of it when it, when it happens. So you know that this website is correct, you've proven it on the ground and you can also do it from different positions and get two people doing it and you can figure out how, how high the space station is by triangulating acu? Yeah. What's the angle? What's the angle? How far apart they are and you can figure out that the space station is actually 250 miles high.

Speaker 4:          01:26:02       It is orbiting the earth at 250 miles and you can also take photographs of the space station with this camera and you can zoom in close enough on the space station to actually see the shape of the space station and the solar panels and the main modules and everything so you can see that actually is something that is moving along the same path that nasa says is moving along and at the same speed as they suggest and it's at the right height and is the right size because you can do the calculations on the camera and figure out what the size of the space station is. So we know that something that the exact same size and shape and speed of the space station is exactly where nasa says it is. And there's really no way you could fake that on a flat earth because you'd have to have this bizarre.

Speaker 4:          01:26:53       A thousand foot wide a floating thing moving along at like 14,000 miles an hour. Doing this kind of whizzy pattern all around this spiral graph pattern around the flat earth. It's Just. It's literally impossible. Whereas if you'd look at it from the globe model point of view, it's just the space station orbiting the globe, but does this bother you? Sometimes you're even debunking the staff, do it, does it? Does I catch myself and go, fuck, am I doing? Yeah, it's obviously, yeah. One of the most stupidly obvious proofs that were not on the flatter is that if you get three people yesterday, standard, one of them or the bottom of South Africa, one of them at the bottom of south America and one of them in Australia and have them all look south from that position. Now on the flat earth, you got one person here, one person here, one person here, and if the old south like away from the north pole, they're all looking in completely different directions, but in the real world, what do they actually see?

Speaker 4:          01:27:52       The lcd, the exact same constellation, the southern cross right in front of them, so they're all looking in different directions on the flood earth, but on the round earth, they're all just looking towards the southern cross. So see what you're sayIng. It's literally impossible to do that on the flat earth and you can actually see this and take photographs of the constellations and compare. And that's something I was talking about with the ground truth thing with malaria. And like you can, you could go virtually yourself to these places and see what the sky looks from that position. Uh, so either solarium is lying or these, you know, the southern cross does actually appear from these three different positions. Well that's another thing that these flatters people keep bringing up as polaris. The idea that this one star puts a great one and that all these other stars rotate aroUnd it and that this is somehow or another proof that they're not spinning.

Speaker 4:          01:28:43       What are there? We're on a flat earth. What's so stupid about that is that people in Australia have a completely different constellations and the stars rotate the other direction around from the start. They're all coming towards us from the east. So if you look north, they're going that way. If you look south the going that way. So the rotating around the north star, which actually isn't anything special, it's just the stuff that happens to be closest to the point, the north point, and it changes all the time. If you zoom in, you can actually see there are stars that are even closer and if you take a time lapse of the north star, it actually makes a little circle. But, and also that north star is not the same north star is in the past because the axis of the earth, uh, there's this thing called procession where they, uh, every 26,000 years and wobbles away.

Speaker 4:          01:29:26       Yeah. But yeah, the south, the south team, everyone's looking at the same thing in the south and the stars are rotating in that direction. But yeah, polaris, polaris is a good one for a number of reasons. One is not really fixed. It's one degree off from the center of the celestial sphere, but if you look at a time lapse photograph of the earth, if they point a camera up like say from north America, what you get is the illusion that all these stars are spinning around that one star. It's fixed, but it's because you're looking at a time lapse of only a few hours where it's dark at night. Whereas this procession of the equinoxes is a very slow process that takes 26,000 years and you're just not going to get a 26,000 years time lapse photo of you could simulate it. You could still area. And I was going to believe that.

Speaker 4:          01:30:12       What's interesting is that some cultures, it's been pretty much observed that some cultures were aware of. The procession of the equinox is thousands of years ago. Somehow that they kind of knew, you know, quite impressive. It will. A lot of old coaches did actually take records of the stars because stars we used for navigation. Yeah. Uh, the post, you know, obviously is something that gives you, this fixed north a degree, but the other stars as well, like if you know, you know what, how long it takes to go from one place to another. You don't really understand the exact math, but you can use it for navigation. It's called celestial navigation. What other ridiculous things can we point out before we wrap this up? My head's starting to hurt. I had food poisoning yesterday, folks. I don't know what happened. I ate something bad at a greasy diner. Well, polaris is a good thing because you can actually look at the angle of polaris was at a bang. Do you hear banging?

Speaker 5:          01:31:09       I heard banging.

Speaker 4:          01:31:18       Oh, it's next door. He is putting something on the wall. It sounds like they shut down the stream twice on us already. Oh really? Yeah, it's flat earth. I'm recording the whole thing. God dammit. Um, what are the things that were they to us, the others wonder why they. Earth's atmosphere isn't sucked off into space. Uh, well, how about the one where that's a good one, but it's a good one because I've wondered that myself. I know now why, why that is. I know why it's such going to get stuck in this space because you think you think that a vacuum sucks things, right? It's going to suck. Everything sucks everything away. So if there's this atmosphere on the earth, the vacuum of space suck it away. But the thing is like vacuum doesn't actually suck. Vacuum is nothing. He has no energy. It doesn't do anything.

Speaker 4:          01:32:05       There's no power. The reason that things flow into vacuum is air pressure and air pressure as a function of gravity. So gravity is pulling everything down towards the earth. So there's no, there's no nothing that can push it out. If you see. You see what I'm saying? If, if you imagine like if the universe was suddenly filled with loads and loads of gas like oxygen. So. And then you stick a big planet in the, all the gas would kind of like gravity would bring it down towards this planet. Will they don't believe in gravity. Electromagnetic. This is my favorite new one. Didn't see the font one. Whether they show that if the earth was a globe, that all the water would be on the bottom. Yeah. That's wonderful. I think that was a joke. It's a joke. How? How can you show? What about the other ones as well, but.

Speaker 4:          01:32:53       No, no, no. Bring it up. Jamie. This one's wonderful. I think they're being serious. Yeah. Now the gravity thing though, it's kind of like almost irrelevant because yeah, we know that things fall down, right, but it's electromagnetic something or another. Well, it's magic. It's a magical force that's making things hold down. It doesn't really matter. You know? Gravity. We could say we don't really understand what gravitates lava lava as part of gravity to write lava. Well, it's the idea that all these rocks are pushing down and there's extreme heat and buoyancy, buoyancy and density and density. The functions of gravitate, like if you stick something in the water, it's all the water is flowing into the bottom. This we're looking at this image folks. It says gravity is not strong enough to stop a small stream from flowing to its lowest point. Then what is stopping the oceans north of the equator from emptying into the ocean south of the equator.

Speaker 4:          01:33:46       This is what the earth would look like if we lived on a globe. Gravity is pseudo science, dot, dot, dot a theory that can't be proven. They forgot the apostrophe and can't you fucking don't look at that image though. It's hilarious. Why is there water on the top at all? How about that? You stupid. Fuck it's raining. It rains on top. Only separates from the bottom and comes around. I'll would be kinda cool if half the planet was dirt and have plant was watering word, whether that be any weirder than what it is now. You know the reason they didn't like gravity is that if you actually apply the lows that gravitates to a flooded flooded with actually scrunch up into a bowl. Oh, okay. Oh yeah. Right. There's no way it can. It can lay flat. It would. It would. It would either be like gravity.

Speaker 4:          01:34:32       It would be an intensely lodge because you've got an infinite abundance of rock underneath. Yeah. Or it's like something on the back of a turtle or something and it will just scrunched up into a bowl. What do they think? Lava is? Molten rock. I mean they just think it's brilliant because it heats up and becomes less dense than the other rock. Why is it? Why is it down there? And the bottom was a core of the fires of hell. A heating it up. The fires of hell. Look at this. What is this? Tennis ball? Why doesn't water fly off the earth spins because the, this for suspending this is a, this is a fundamental misunderstanding that they will have. They, they, uh, misinterpret angular velocity and linear velocity. Like we know the earth is spinning around a thousand miles an hour, right? They think if this bowl was spinning around at a thousand miles an hour, then the water would, would, would fly off.

Speaker 4:          01:35:19       But it's not flying off because of the surface of the bowl going a thousand miles an hour, it's flying off because it's rotating it like 50 times a second or whatever, and 10 times a second, it's the angular velocity which creates the outward force. Linear plots has got nothing to do with it. He's anyone. You're actually turning, you know when you're driving in a car, like you'd be driving really, really fast. You didn't really feel any forces act on you, but when you go around the corner, you get slumped over to one side. So it's the the rate of your angular velocity. Now the earth rotates once, once every 24 hours. So it's going really, really, really slow. Put that back up please. And if you imagine that tennis ball, and if you take it and stick in a little turntable, the rotates, once every 24 hours, the water is not going to fly off. And it's the exact same force acting on the earth because the earth rotates once every 24 hours. The fact that it's like you're going a thousand miles an hour, it's completely irrelevant because it's essentially going in straight lines around the edge. Jamie, go to that photo on the upper left hand side. Scroll up

Speaker 2:          01:36:23       satan's globe earth like this.

Speaker 4:          01:36:25       This, this bottom picture here is a great example of how ridiculous things are. It's hold on

Speaker 2:          01:36:30       satan's globe earth lied. The big bang and evolution. Explain life. You were an accident. We evolved from primordial soup. We are specs in the universe. Some people are more valuable than others. Foundation for the new world order you are worthless. Next image. God's flat earth creation is the only explanation. We are incredibly valuable. The bible is 100 percent true. We live on an unmoving firm foundation. You were created by god in all caps. God loves you and that that

Speaker 4:          01:37:04       seems better. That's probably a true believer. The oh yeah. You think that image there is a is a good example of things that are just completely ridiculous on the flutter earth. You see they have the sun on one side and it's eliminating healthier and the way, the way it's cooked like that. The thing that runs way closer to. Right? Yeah. They think the. The son acted like a spotlight. He's looking at that. It's not like a spotlight is illuminating all of the ice wall. Where's the ice wall? That's the white stuff, right? Yeah. Oh yeah. Which is actually. It's just a antarctica stretched into this projection. Why doesn't one of those dickheads getting a boat and take a photo that wall? Well, that's another thing. They think they'll go god's all the way around it. Oh, there are guards. Yeah. That's a. What is that? That's true for like 36,000 miles of guards of gods in the ocean with on a freezing ice

Speaker 2:          01:37:56       wall. Is the wall from it. Game of thrones is that 36,000 miles. They make up facts and then they use those facts to kind of stayed there. Point like you can't. It's illegal to fly over antarctica. Yeah. That's kind of based on like half. Well a quarter truth like you have to have. You can't fly to engine jet over antarctica because if an engine fails you wouldn't be able to get to an airport. So they only allow a four engine jets, seven, four, seven, zero, eight, three eight is to fly. So all those, those flights that you see that go over at the antarctic ice, they're all seven, four, seven. Yeah. Because if it fucks up your doomed. Yeah. Yeah. it's a long way with nothing because set of regulations called itar, which is all about how far you can go away from an airport and what configuration of plane that you have to do.

Speaker 2:          01:38:46       See now I wonder how many people are listening to this and it's turning their mind. Do you think it's possible? Do you think there's. There's gotta be a spectrum of people that believe there is a spectrum and some people will, will be turned. This will cause a lot of ruffled feathers. Are you ready for the shill tweets? Are you ready? Well, you were around her. She'll shirt if we get you one and jamie.com. I actually done like. It's very complicated. I know it's all, it's all in good humor. Soft people like joking around, but take it seriously. Oh yeah. With that said, I make stuff up that my wife got me because I'm always making stupid jokes. Right. And someone saw a photograph of me online wearing this tee shirt that said I make stuff up and says make west. I'd missing a completely serious.

Speaker 2:          01:39:29       Yeah. But there stupid. Um, yeah, but it's part of the mesa to reach people if, uh, if, you know the, the pointing the been, it's a distraction, right? Something like that. Yeah. I guess I guess I hear what you're saying. I'm pretty easy to dismiss. Um, they always say that you work for the government. That's the big one. you're a government employee. You made video games, video game programmer. I helped make the tony hawk series of video games and made enough money to retire on. And now I just pushed her around the house. Do gardening and do a debunking stuff. Do fun experiments in the village. You live in the goddamn american dream. It's where you're doing. You made enough money to not have to slave away. And these assholes who want to think that you're some government shill, like the governments involved in the tony hawk video games.

Speaker 2:          01:40:12       They recruited you. They said, listen, I know you're doing a good job making these video games. We've got a better place for you. I need to do is cover up the flat earth and chem trails and you have photos. And what else? What else you cover up? Morgellons. Morgellons disease is a fascinating one. It's one of the ones that we introduced that we investigated on that show. And do you know that one of the guys that we interviewed was a doctor and what he thinks is that everyone who has more gallons also has lyme disease and lyme disease has a neuro toxicity effect. And he was talking to himself about his own hallucinations that he sees things like crawling crosses eyes that he knows aren't there. Oh yeah. He was a very rational and he

Speaker 3:          01:40:54       was also saying that lyme disease, when you get it from ticks, that you're not just getting this one disease, but you're getting a host of pathogens and sometimes these pathogens will interact with each other. In very different ways and that you know, some are more extreme, some are less extreme, but he's like you might be dealing with hundreds of different pathogens that are an undiscovered or are undefined and he thinks that what's going on with a lot of these people that have more jealous is lyme disease and whatever these other diseases are that's causing them to hallucinate and think that fibers are growing out of their skin would really. What it is is they're scratching themselves and then they get like carpet fibers or clothing fibers on their skin and then they think it's coming out of there. He was very reasonable and he made a ton of sense because we went to this more jealous convention and we talked to all these people that had it and they fucking all have lyme disease. They all have it.

Speaker 4:          01:41:44       Well, they'll. They'll get tested positive for it. That's a bit of controversy about that because the test that you can do, you can basically keep doing it and it's kind of a very inexact test for lyme disease and it gives a lot of false positives. There's a bunch of different tests, but there's so many people

Speaker 3:          01:41:57       with lyme disease, which is where it's interesting because lyme diseases, it's. I know a lot of people that have gotten it from ticks and it's fair

Speaker 4:          01:42:04       thing. It's a real thing that's devastating. There's a lot of controversy. Well, yeah. It's one of those things that the medical community as a mainstream opinion about whether the longterm effects from lyme disease and then there's people who think that there is the longterm effects, so there's some dispute. There is some.

Speaker 3:          01:42:21       Let me clArify from people that I know that have gotten it. One of the things about the medical community is the ignorance of the of lyme disease and that you go to a lot of different doctors and they. They poo poo it. They say, oh, this is nothing to worry about. My friend's son got it and he developed bell palsy, bell's palsy. His face went numb and that was when they took it seriously and they finally gave him this intense round of intravenous antibiotics, but my friend was on antibiotics for months. I mean, he was devastated and we had a guy in here that had it for three years and he had it for a full year where he was undying. Steven kotler it a full year where, who's undiagnosed? And his body just was ravaged

Speaker 4:          01:42:58       by this stuff. Well, I used to do write a lot about morgellons, which is related to lyme disease. And one of the reasons I stopped doing it was the, it's such a personal thing for the people involved, uh, and I just really wasn't comfortable like calling them liars. Not that, but just trying to, trying to figure out what's really going on and raising possibilities that it might not be like these bugs living under their skin because they just get very upset and you, you really, you weren't reaching a lot of them. So eventually I stopped that and I moved on to chem trails, which I thought would be a more reasonable people involved. But uh,

Speaker 3:          01:43:34       it's another one where people or initially invested in that idea. And then once they become initially invested, it's so hard to shake them off. It's so hard. They just are absolutely convinced that the government is spraying things. So yeah, I had a conversation with a friend of mine. I was like, dad has got to be the most ineffective use of money ever. like they're spraying things and what the fuck has changed? Nothing. Nothing's changed. They're spending all this money spraying things in the sky that just happened to look like clouds, but yet we know that you can make clouds with a jet engine and a certain amount of condensation in the atmosphere. The heat of the jet engine causes clouds. Like we know that, but they don't think that's what

Speaker 4:          01:44:08       it is. Yeah. Yeah. This is established science established nine. Well, like, you know, the flood earth is just steadily. The lack of flatness of the earth is established science that's been going on for a real long time. Uh, and people just pick and choose which science they went to to you. What keeps you going with all this stuff for the running metal bunk? Well, I, I enjoy like doing this little little experiments. Uh, I do a lot of stuff like, you know, going into my backyard and testing things out, uh, like a lot of this stuff you, there's pictures of ufo was and things like that and you can, you can duplicate them because some of them are like, like reflections or things in the canberra and yoU can go out and say, well, this did this. Or people are saying that certain photograph is a indication that it's false or these shadows go this way. You know, the moon landing has lots of fake shadow claims made about it. What do you think happened at roswell, New Mexico? the one that's the big one, July, 1947. A ufo crash. Yeah. I think it's what the, what it said it was, it was, uh, that uh, those balloons that they were using to detect a russian nuclear bombs in the atmosphere. And it was a secret program so they weren't allowed to tell anybody about it. So they came in, they picked up the remains of the balloon and then the story just took off.

Speaker 3:          01:45:20       That's a funnY one though. Boy, that's, that's made a whole town. Yeah. Famous for ufo, if you go there noW, they have like alien themed gift shop,

Speaker 4:          01:45:29       so the milking it and it's like you said earlier, like people make money out of something and then they get stuck into that just because they're making money out of it. They're motivated to promote whatever it is, a big foot or if it's aliens. Have you ever seen anything and all of your years of trying to debunk these things that made you question whether or not this was a legitimate phenomena, the chem trail, anything? Anything, anything. Bufo chem trail thing. It's like with ufo. There's all things that you can't explain. There are things that are identified, but there are usually plausible explanations for them. I like to, whenever I'm given something that can be mysterious thing, I like to list all the explanations that I can think of and maybe none of them are a perfect fix that fits that you can guarantee this is what the explanation is, but like it being like a ghost or an alien spacecraft as an explanation is usually pretty close to the bottom.

Speaker 4:          01:46:20       Like you started out saying, oh, it's a balloon or a bird, or it's a drone or at cgi or it's something, something somebody faked afterWards, or it's an alien spacecraft or in between that like always something else that we don't know what it is. Is there any evidence like in terms of ufo? That's interesting. I haven't to be honest, I haven't really looked into the, the whole sphere of ufo biology. Uh, I know a lot of people have, but just looking at the quality of the best cases they put forward. Like I mentioned earlier, like you know, some guy in 1964, like got his car beat up on a road a, these are like the top 10 best cases. And this was like number two or something. What about bob? LiZ, are you ever looking at that guy and ah, which was he as the guy who supposedly know, supposedly worked at area 51 and became a whistle blower.

Speaker 4:          01:47:15       no, I haven't, but a lot. It's something You see. And the nine slash 11 community is. and in the chem trail community is people kind of becoming celebrities. Yeah. And then they kind of start going on road shows and you know, they go to conventions and they speak and then they write books and then they start doing things and they, they get sucked into the, the, the beliefs. And there's been lots of examples in the past of people who made claims like this. And then eventually, uh, you know, owned up to it, you know, the classic one really classic one is the cost tingly fair is where these girls and continually england sound I went to school in, but it's still world famous thing, a fake these photographs of fairies. And they, they convinced a large number of people in including, like arthur conan doyle, a really guy wrote tarzan.

Speaker 4:          01:48:06       Yeah. He believed in fairies. Well, no, the guy who wrote sherlock holmes did arthUr conan doyle, right. Turns out that was a william burroughs and I went, no, no, someone else. Anyway, but they look at that. They stuck to that. So they obviously fake out of a magazine or something. Uh, and then they owned up like basically on their deathbeds live 70 years later. But they were, they were milking it because once they get into it is embarrassing to admit that you made something up, plus you're getting all this attention. Right. And in some cases you're getting money. I don't know if they get any money and I wonder how many people were so duped by that, that changed their life and they started looking for ferries and wasting their time when I was growing up. That was, that was put out as being a genuine fairy citing.

Speaker 4:          01:48:56       Really? Yeah. And you believe it? Pull them? No. Well I probably did when I was like, you know, 13. Oh six people. People get sucked in and they become celebrities. Uh, and then they like, there it is. Yeah. Tna reveals the fIrst time letter which ended the cotton hundley pleasingly here. Emily hoax. Yeah. I went to school, just retail, just behind the house. So for 70 years this lady kept lie. Yeah. there was two of them I think what bitch and people like that in the ufo community who like made up stories of abductions and things. And then later the stories either become so ridiculous and contradictory. You know that they were lying. There's a wonderful one from this guy from the 19 fifties where it's a great old black

Speaker 2:          01:49:48       and white footage and they talked to him about his ufo experiences and all the different aliens that he communicates with and he just seems so obviously crazy and yet this was heralded as one of the most important cases of ufr log and you know, the guy I'm talking about, I forget the guy's now as many. There was a thing called hubcaps and shit. The montauk chronicles, which I think you would do the segments on that. it was like an island where they have an underground thing where they really meant to be experimenting on children. Plum island wasn't plum island. Anyway, there was, there was something like that. This guy basically said he had all these remembered memories of working on this secret government base. Uh, and he became like pretty famous. You'd read loads of books, but I think he might have just been a bit crazy.

Speaker 2:          01:50:35       But. well, there's a lot of that out there for sure. Is there anything else in your pile of notes over there to get people to? I think the thing I would really encourage people to do is look closely at things like it's really hard to do, but if people who are on the fence, they they need to look very, very closely at the claims that people are making claims that the bay is making. If eric debase say something like, you know, the horizon always rises to eye level. This is something you can actually check and it's not easy. He got to be reasonably careful with us $2 level, but you can actually check to see whether that is correct. You can check for yourself if something reappears over the horizon when you zoom in and which is something that he claimed, something that as ridiculous claim that has been made for like over a hundred years that when things move away from you, they disappear from the bottom up and if you zoom in, they will reappear.

Speaker 2:          01:51:29       He doesn't actually happen. When you zoom in on something, all it does is it makes the picture bigger. It makes the image bigger and you can check this for yourself. You can go down to santa monica pier, you can focus on like the north shore like malibu, and you can zoom in and you can see the picture does not change at all throughout the entire zone and when you're fully zoomed in so you can see the cars whizzing along, pca, you will see that the bottom part of, uh, of, of the road is, and the buildings are obscured and you can do it with catalina. You can turn around and look at catalina and you can zoom in on that and you can see that two thirds of catalina island is missing. I think a lot of what you're saying is very important because what we're talking about is just being able to look at things objectively and use facts to determine that this one theory in particular flatter theory is not true. But I think what's really going on is the thought process. There is a way the human mind gravitates towards these puzzles and these problems and these, these undiscovered truths, these, these mysteries that people just want to be the person that knows they want to be in the know and it's very intoxicating and that's what really this stuff's all about more than anything. It's about the way the mind works and about the way your mind can be tricked

Speaker 3:          01:52:46       and it's an information issue that we're dealing with today with things like youtube where no one can stop you from making like you don't have to go through the people that work at nbc or fox or whatever. You'd have to go through the wall street journal or the New York times editorial board where they have to review your paper and go, hey, you wrote a bunch of stuff. ThAt's not true. That doesn't have to happen anYmore. Now you can just make a video and it can be really well done with good music and good images and the way it's done can really influence a lot of people who don't have a background in science or not curious about looking into the debunking version. Of it, whenever, when someone sends me something, I always say, just google that whatever you sent me and then debunked, just do that first and then look at both sides, you know? But people don't want that. debunk that debunks not sexy.

Speaker 4:          01:53:35       Yeah. That's pretty sexy. I know people are turned off by the debunking thing. I hate it. Yeah, and that's why I do tell people to go do their own research, but really actually do some real research as in do some actual observations and experiment. Boring. Youtube videos are fun. You know, you watch a youtube video about dinosaurs being faked. That's fun. What? They're fake. I can't believe it. They fucking got me. Just like watching a youtube video about roswell rods or any of these other silly things and kind of excited about the eclipse. I think that's an opportunity to get people excited about a scientist though. Not thinking like a loon. I know like I get excited about the eclipse, but not everyone does. Well, it's exciting. It is exciting. It's pretty rare. Solar eclipse. The moon is going to come of the sun. Yeah. Get your camera. What does that happen? Check it. August 21st. It's going to be totality in Oregon, but you had to see it from all of a lot of people going to go to Oregon just to see it. Yeah, I'm going to Oregon. Are you? Wow. Look at you. You don't fuck around type relative. So it an excuse. They're going to try to schedule some sort of a dinner time. They, we're going to be out of the campsite. Yeah. Looking at the eclipse. um, anything else?

Speaker 4:          01:54:46       And I saw the same. oh, uh, uh, and it's kind of complicated, but let me just run right by you real quick. maps, maps, maps, and you hit the maketa projection. No, the standard map that you see in school rooms has this really stretched out. Iceland, greenland, it looks like kind of distorted. It's not like the real world. And the reason that we use these maps, this particular type of map is that if you draw a line between two points on the map, uh, and then you sail along that heading, you will end up at that point. Now this, uh, this is a type of navigation called a rum line navigation that's been used for like hundreds of years, and the thing is that the map, the makeda matt gets stretched out to the top but also get stretched out at the bottom because the navigators have from hundreds of years ago knew that the world was round and that they knew if they drew a line between two points in the southern hemisphere using the same map, it would get you to that destination using rum navigation, which is basically just one more piece of evidence.

Speaker 4:          01:55:51       That's the actual, the global map matches reality because people have used rum navigation for hundreds of years, if not thousands of years. So you're saying that the image of the continents is in some way stretched out and distorted? Yeah. Well, if you take a glider, they do that. We will. If you take a globe and like just, you can't just put it onto a flat surface, right? Because you're gonna have to distort it somehow. Uh, so there's various different ways people use of, of, of putting it on, on the surface. You could just take, you know, you love to do to longitude and just map it into a rectangle and that, that works out fairly well. that's a nice thing that's called equirectangular map, but the most common map that was used like before, like say 30 years ago was this maketa projection, which is the map that people use.

Speaker 4:          01:56:34       Navigating ship routes. So you can get from point a to b if you wanted to go from england to, uh, you know, north America across the ocean, you just draw a line between the two points and then you say, oh, that's the heading I've got to go in. And so you head off in that heading. Now that doesn't take you in a straight line. It actually takes you into kind of a curved line because if you, if you're going on a constant compass heading on a globe, you actually kind of curve in towards the poles or away from the pole depending which way you're going. I really don't understand what you're saying, but all it is, is that this method of navigation that people use that relies upon the earth being a globe. And it's this really, really simple map that is in thousands of homes, millions of homes and schools that everybody uses, and you can see that on the map, the lines get smaller towards the top and it gets more towards the bottom.

Speaker 4:          01:57:25       And if people are doing, uh, a voyage around the world, they're going to use this map and it only works on, it works on there around the globe world. That's another issue too. People have circumnavigated the globe. Yeah. Well they think they do sail around the outside, which of course would take a lot longer. Uh, that's another thing like the Australia. Have you seen Australia on the flood earth map? It's like a no on the image that was up earlier. It's like this kind of squish thing, you know, where to Australia it looks like it's more or less like, this looks like it's kind of like this, it's all stretched out. It's like twice as long and half as wide. Have you seen the theory, the conspiracy theory that Australia is scooby doo a? No. Give it to his head. Yes. Yeah, I can say that it's just a joke.

Speaker 4:          01:58:06       Italy as a boot. Yeah. They just. It's one of those joke names. The distances between places in Australia don't work. Is that the flatter? Yeah. that's the flat earth map and that's Australia and Australia. It looks nothing like that and if you live in Australia you would know it looks nothing at all like that. It's just hilarious that there's so many versions of this similarity. There's so many people who've taken the time in front of a computer to create this flat earth map and put this ice wall and the idea that. How do they know? It's a nice wall. Like where? Where's the pictures? There's pictures of ice shelves from antarctica, so they think that that's the whole wall. I think that's the wool. Yeah, so that you'll see memes like, yeah, globally what? Flat ice wall and they'd be like this and they show you.

Speaker 4:          01:58:51       they suck on an ice shelf, which is like 200 feet high. What'd you could fly over? That's the mentality, right? It's a bunch of little kids or a bunch of dumb people or a bunch of people that have very little education or a bunch of people that are also speaking. They're preaching to the choir. It ties into like a misconception. Is that a natural, like a funny thing like when I worked in the video game industry, there was a platform games. You jumped from little platforms and some of the times the platforms and move around and like mario type things, right? Uh, in some video games when you jump up on a moving platform and then jumped down and fall down, you will fall down because the platform moves out from underneath you. Sometimes you jump up and you move with the platform and you land on it.

Speaker 4:          01:59:32       It depends on what the program did. Right now a friend of mine was doing a video game and I wanted the program and said like, oh, he jumped up and then jump down. The platform should have moved out from underneath you. So you should be able to like, hey, you should be able to, uh, you know, this is the way we should program the physics. And then my friend matt said, no, that's wrong. And uh, he couldn't convince this other guy. So eventually what happened? He says, right, what we're going to do is we're going to go out onto the road with my pickup, my pickup truck, I'm going to get in the back and you're going to drive along at 30 miles an hour and I'm going to jump straight up in the air and we're going to see whether I land in the truck or a land on the road.

Speaker 4:          02:00:11       So they did this experiment and the guy, the other guy who was driving the truck was totally expecting him to like jump up and pull out the back of the truck because the truck went and moved on because he's moving the same speed as the truck. So he jumps up and then he lands back in the tRuck. And this, that. This is illustrating that this video game program, I had the exact same misconception that the flat earth is due because they say, well, what if the earth is moving so fast? Why can't you just go up in a helicopter, hover a bit, wait for the earth to move underneath you, and then go back down again. It's just, you know, it's completely backwards physics because you are already moving, so you'd have to slow down to zero a which is the same as speeding up and relatively speaking.

Speaker 4:          02:00:48       So, uh, the point is that anyone can make misconceptions about physics like that. Yeah. And it's easy to get sucked into that and it's actually quite hard to break them even play. This is reasonable guy. It was like a video game program, but who presumably knew something about physics. He was convinced that matt was going to fall out to the back of the truck and quite possibly die, but he still didn't do the experiment. Well, let's end it on that because this is literally hurting my brain, right? But what you're doing is very important and I really want to thank you. Thank you. Your website is very important. It's very important for people who are curious and concerned and don't understand the physics and the logic and the science behind it all, but I've. I've sent your site to many, many people that believed or don't believe and we're trying to figure out a way to explain it, so thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thanks for being. All right folks, that's it for the week. Syria.
