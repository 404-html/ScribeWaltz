Speaker 1:          00:00:00       We are doing this show and the honor of Derek, the safari guide who was killed by Cecil's cousin in Africa today will all day my fucking facebook has been a mess because of people angry at me thinking that I really cared that this fucking safari guide got killed. But Abby Martin is here to straighten everything out. Did you. Did you cry when Cecil? No, I didn't shed any tears. No, no. I cried when Jimmy Kimmel cried. Yeah. See, these stories are just. I just feel like they're manufactured kind of outrage and feign outrage for people to just feel better. I mean, yes, of course you should love animals and humans and have solidarity with all living things, but it just seemed really manufacturing. Especially when I read interviews with people who lived there and they were like, who the fuck is cecil the lion? Like the way the hysteria in this country made it seem like he was like their national animal.

Speaker 1:          00:00:54       Like this was the lion that was like the lion, right? This beloved creature. And everyone was like, why do Americans care so much about this lion who no one had heard anything about him at all until this guy killed them. And then once we decided that there was a name to. So, you know, then it became this big thing where I had justin wren, who's a friend of mine who works in the Congo, he, um, he builds water wells for these people in the Congo that don't have a fresh water. And he said the most sobering statistic yesterday, he said, 5,000 children between the age of up to the age of five die every day in the Congo because they drink dirty water. $5,000 a day, a day. I can't even comprehend. So insane. It's impossible to wrap your head around. And you know, black lives don't matter.

Speaker 1:          00:01:46       Lions matter. Seriously. I mean, when you're, that someone else wrote a really poignant editorial like this African woman. And she was just like this, you know, there's so much death and destruction basically because of just so many things. Globalization, especially with the raping of the Congo, the civil war there. And she was like, but lions matter more than black lives and that's the absolute truth. And I think when people can anthropomorphize this creature and feel some sort of connection to it, you can do that about anything you can do that about. We do it for, with our dogs. But the truth is we're eating animals every day. Um, you know, it just seemed like picking and choosing just because it's this majestic creature. Yeah. It was also, it gives people an opportunity to be really angry and not think about the real problems. Like there was all these people in front of Cecil's, uh, or this guy, the dentist, a dentist's office, and they were saying they should have his head on their wall. People, I would like to see his head on a wall like you really want. Do you want a person to be killed now to. Well, you know what, I actually hit me a little bit too close to home because I saw the, um, this kind of wave of hysteria and like vitriol against this guy and actual lambasting him with the death threats over and over again. People going in Samaritan blood on his office and stuff and I just

Speaker 2:          00:03:00       was really, really horrified because I was like, Holy Shit, this, this happened to me on a really micro scale with the Chris Kyle stuff. I was just like getting like incessantly peddled with death threats and that's awful. It's wrong. You can't do that to someone. We're all human beings and you can't do that. Even if you hate someone or think that they, you know, if you personally want someone to die, like you can't just be like, you should die because you hunted a line, you should die because you were a fuck Chris Kyle shirt. I just think that apply it across the board and this kind of online bullying and like driving people into a hole or doxing them and exposing their personal information because you disagree with something that they did. It's wrong. Mia Farrow Docs, the dentist, Pharaoh, she put the dentist to dress online. Wow. The last person that I would ever expect to do that.

Speaker 2:          00:03:51       That's so interesting. That's so interesting. Wow. Shit. To fuck with you, Ellen. What do you want for it? It's not a joke, it's not a joke to get docs and to get like peddled with death threats. Well, you, uh, you had the Chris Kyle t shirt the fuck cruise. Carl t shirt. Was that, what did it for? Was it the being on the show that did it? So you did warn me. I'm just in case people haven't heard the last episode that I was on. Um, I talked about how Chris Kyle was a sociopath. I talked about how he lied in his book about, you know, killing people. I'm beating dogs or horses so bad that his hand broke. But the thing is he's lied about so many things. I just even tours proven that he lied about that fight and stuff. So we can't really trust what he said in his book.

Speaker 2:          00:04:33       But I think it's just odd that someone would lie about killing black people in Hurricane Katrina. Like why would you brag about that? You think that you would brag about a story about like saving a child, but instead he talked about how he was actually bragging about like slaughtering people who release, which is super fucking weird or stealing things super fucking weird and I just want to make it very clear that I have a lot of respect for veterans and soldiers who choose a defect. They, there's a lot of heroic people like Ben Griffin, special operations and in the UK who basically went to Iraq and just refuse to go back. So there's a ton of amazing veterans and soldiers who I think that should be praised, especially when we're looking at something like the Iraq war, which was a complete disaster, countless dead, callous, maimed. Now Isis is erupted.

Speaker 2:          00:05:21       So when we have these heroes that are mythologized in our society and when we have someone like Chris Kyle, who's the pinnacle of what the hero should be from that war and rewriting the history of the Iraq war, I think it's really dangerous. So I just, you know, I, I talked about how, what I really felt about Chris Kyle and um, people got really upset. My friend Leo who runs this clothing company, printed a shirt, a one off shirt fuckers, kyle, and he was just like, he want, he wanted me to wear it. I was like, yeah, fuck it, let's, let's take a photo. And I posted on my instagram account, my instagram account, like doesn't have that many followers. I was like, I did not know the shitstorm that would be in suing whatsoever. So, you know, war the fuck Chris Collared Shirt, tits out. Um, you know, two weeks go by and I was like, whatever.

Speaker 2:          00:06:06       Nothing happened. I wake up to every, like it almost started where I was like, Oh shit, this is gonna be a really good art project because I was getting peddled with like the craziest shit you've ever heard. Like rape, like genital mutilation. So detailed that I was like, is this isis actually writing these comments because it seems like these people actually admire racists because it's like the most grotesque disturbing things about my vagina and what they wanted isis to do to it that I was like, holy fuck. Like you guys must have like some sick admiration for Isis. Don't. When you saw that, do you report those people? So it started. I remember I was going to Baltimore and I just was getting it so frequently that I was like, holy fuck. So my instagram, I kind of had to like make it private immediately because someone had gone, like people had gone through and said we're going to put our raping shoes on and find you all this shit, you know?

Speaker 2:          00:06:53       So I, I shut that down. And then I went on facebook and saw that, you know, every single art post that I had on my art page, every single public. So I had to, like, I didn't want to shut it down because I was like, I don't want to defer to these threats, but at the same time it was getting so extreme that I couldn't handle it, like the volume of, of death and rape threats because at first I was like category cataloging them and I was like, okay, I'm taking screenshots of all these, I'm going to make this giant like, like art project. And I was like, Oh fuck this, this is like, not that, this is actually getting way, way too crazy. Um, and then I got doxed by this guy. I'm this veteran who basically just wrote me and he was like, Hey, I just posted your address and all the veteran and sniper forums.

Speaker 2:          00:07:33       I was like, there's sniper forms. And he was like telling people you know how to find you. And then I found out that my mom got doxed so my mom's personal information got exposed. And so luckily I was already moving in a week, but I was just like, this is, this is shit crazy. So I tried to contact the cops for like the, I think there was like 10 really graphic like I'm going to come to your house this Saturday, cut your clit off, like let you bleed to death on the floor. Like just, I mean things like that. I was like, and it was a person's public facebook page. You can see as like license plate in the photo. He had like a baby, you know, they're just like these people out there who are just totally proud to be like completely homicidal and rapey and really sociopathic acting.

Speaker 2:          00:08:14       So I went to the cops and I was like, look, there's like five people who I know who they are. They've said that they're going to come kill me or raped me or cut my clit off. And I was like, is there anything that you can, you can do? And they basically just took the report and nothing ever happened. We were supposed to go to the FBI. Didn't do it was so funny. I called the FBI and they're like, yeah. They're like, oh, online threats? Yeah. Just go to this website and file it. Like, there's probably so many online threats going on every day. Oh my God. Especially with killing. Yeah. I mean, the thing, the thing that was just, it just upset me so much because people were. People were comparing me to like Pamela Geller. They're like, okay, you can wear a fuckers kyle shirt and like Pamela Geller can have the drama Muhammad contest.

Speaker 2:          00:08:58       I'm like, first of all, Stop Dfi. And Chris Kyle was like a prophet. Like, that's insane. Um, second of all, we're not talking about a marginalized portion of society, which is like Arabs who are basically like this, this generation's like demonized population. I was like, we're talking about Chris Kyle, which is like the peak of the empire, this, you know, homicidal soldier who's like glorified and in war propaganda and shit. So you can't really compare the two. But I just think it's really important to understand the real history of the Iraq war and I think American sniper really not only whitewashed it but just doubled down on the myth and the establishment chooses these war heroes to perpetuate. And Chris Kyle is not a hero. I think that there are countless heroes that we would be much more appropriate to hail.

Speaker 3:          00:09:51       Well, it's hard too, when you look at a story like the American sniper story, it's hard to figure out what really happened because there were definitely some fabrications. So it's hard to figure out, okay. Military people, when they retire, they do not get much money. It's, it's, it's piss poor and it's, it's quite an embarrassment. It's an embarrassment as far as the way they're treated medically. Um, the, uh, the UFC has worked really hard to provide money for the intrepid institute for, um, but for traumatic brain injuries, which is a huge issue with soldiers because the medical community has made so many incredible advances that people live that didn't live, you know, 30, 40 years ago. So now these, these guys are living with some significant brain injuries. And while we were doing one of these fundraisers, it was, it was hitting me. I was like, why the amount of billions and billions of dollars that are spent on this war, how the fuck could they not allocate a similar amount to take care of the soldiers?

Speaker 3:          00:10:55       Because the soldiers don't have a voice, like nobody gives a fuck for them. Nobody cares. So when these guys retire, there's not a lot of options. And so I was trying to figure out, okay, why would a guy like Chris Kyle make up all these stories? He was talking about shooting car jackers in Texas that turned out to not be true. He said he was shooting people and Katrina that were looting. There was all these stories that didn't hold water and I was trying to think it was do you that maybe this guy was trying to fabricate a bunch of crazy shit and put it in his book because it would make the book more sensational and sell. And this would be a way that this guy could provide for his family.

Speaker 2:          00:11:34       Oh, you mean me? Like, yeah, bringing it back to the human level, I'm sure. But I mean I keep going back to the people who just is like, yeah, I feel for soldiers who come back with traumatic brain injuries. But I do honestly think, especially, uh, you know, dating a veteran who was in the initial invasion of Iraq and stuff, um, there are people who the military because they want to kill people. A lot of people joined the military because they have no options. A lot of people joined the military because they believed in the Iraq war and the war on terror and a lot of people just want to slaughter people. And I think Chris Kyle was one of those people, unfortunately. Do you think you become one of those people once you get out there? Exacerbated? Yeah, astronomically. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          00:12:16       Once you shoot the first few people like me and that was a part of the, the movies that the first person he shot was a kid, you know, first of all, the movie wasn't good and I was really confused by that. You didn't think it was good? No, that was terrible. I thought it was a terrible movie. Wasn't well done. It was like a clunky made for TV movie. It felt like to me. Did you see it? No, it's not gonna. It's not a good movie. In Arusha fear was talking about how bad it was and I was, I thought when Ari was saying that, that he was just being hypercritical. Ari hates a lot of things and I'm like, oh my God, maybe he's sorry, but our watch, I was like, this is not a good movie. It's just not a good movie. And you know, Bradley Cooper is a really good actor, but it was wooden. I felt like I felt like it was just, it wasn't, didn't have a life to. It goes to Chris Kyland and felt like it was just. Oh Man. Did he really say that? Yeah, that's what I was like, oh, he's going for it. Going for all in golf, a Hollywood superstar who wants to be the guy. I'm seeing the movie.

Speaker 2:          00:13:25       Yeah. And aside from just the movie, be mad. I think it's just unfortunate to kind of personalize this character so much when you know, ignoring basically people came out of the movie, sanding rockies are savages, and it was all like justified because they're looking through the eyes of someone like Chris Kyle when really, I mean, look at Iraq today. Millions of refugees, I mean, as I just said, the culture is just completely destroyed and it's like, what about those people? So it's important. Yeah, we can humanize Chris Kyle and of course we can humanize every soldier that's coming back because they were sold false pretenses to go to war. But um, I just have to feel more for the, for the people who are just the occupants of the country and they just were casualties of this mess

Speaker 4:          00:14:04       should I think we should feel for all humans equally, especially people that we don't know. And the idea that they're not as valuable because they live over there. Yeah. If there was something that happened over here where there was a foreign invasion that caused a million casualties that from innocent civilians would be up in arms and horrified. And I don't know what the real numbers are for the Iraq invasion because it's hard to figure it out. There's a bunch of different argued numbers. Let's say it's the low ball number, which is more than a hundred thousand innocent civilians. That's horrific. It's horrific to think that that's the low ball number and the high ball number, somewhere around 2 million Sam Harris. Come on right up to this big on the low ball numbers. Here's

Speaker 1:          00:14:52       the problem. And I am, I'm, this is all I'm going to say about Santa Ana because I know that you offered the debate and I really appreciate that night. Um, I really, really appreciate you offering that because I know that we've been going back and forth on twitter and shit. I've gone back and forth. Oh, like he, he actually wrote or he, you know, just the firehose of bullshit saying that all I was saying was like hyperbolic sensational figures and stuff. And the problem that I have with Sam Harris and debating him is that, um, I don't feel like I should or need to debate in neuroscience about foreign policy. Like I don't. I'm interested in what he has to say about like neuroscience and interesting things that are like what he studied, but as far as someone arguing with me about like the US foreign policy and empire, um, who's a neuroscientist, I don't see any reason that I would get out of that.

Speaker 1:          00:15:36       Especially someone who talks about mass casualties with zero empathy. Um, I don't necessarily think he's talking about it with zero. Empathy I think was like a stone cold killer was trying to be objective about the numbers and not interject emotions with it. Totally. But don't you think that he would say, why would I talk to someone who was a reporter about foreign policy? No. Journalists I think are much more credible than just like scientists who are just jumping into mix new atheism movement and just being like, let's, let's have a giant debate all about Islam. I don't, I just don't get it. I mean, the, the, the information information is available to anybody in this day and age. Right? It's innovate in what he is. Maybe he has a degree in neuroscience and he is a neuroscientist, but really he's an author and he researches things and he talks about things and agree with them or disagree with them in the way he presents the numbers and the way he's presenting this, this argument.

Speaker 1:          00:16:32       I think there's a lot of debate as far as how many people died over there. Yeah. Well here's the number. Here's the problem with hin is that this is. He's. He's basically. He nitpicked all my numbers saying that they were huge, but all he did was basically site official casualty count numbers from the Pentagon. It's like, do you think that that's the fucking neck or number that's way worse going to the lowest ball number of casualties and saying this is cited. Some other people as well, and the high number that he was citing I think was around 200,000. Right? It was that do. I don't remember. I'm not good at recalling numbers. I just think it's. I just think it's funny that that's what he hammered in on his meat. Basically blowing up the numbers when he basically went to the. The most extreme small calculations that have been determined by military personnel when, when basically the General Dempsey said, we don't do body counts. That's what he said during the Iraq war. We don't do body counts, so yeah, it is really hard to tell how many people died, but the international business times did a study in 2006. It said a million were dead at that point. So yeah, it is hard. I just am sending include, but they include Shia and Sunni in fighting as well. Right. Which is a lot of it was caused by the Iraq war, which really triggered a huge amount of civil unrest because there was a power going on between

Speaker 3:          00:17:50       the Sunni and the Shia, which were was more under control when Saddam Hussein was in control of our rack. That is calculated in that casualty figure. That's. That's.

Speaker 2:          00:18:02       Well, yeah, and a direct result of like a directory

Speaker 3:          00:18:06       and that's what brings it really high. It's really bad and I think that's one of the things that he argues against that you can't attribute that to the United States military invasion because it's sort of a side effect of the military invasion, the civil war that's going on there.

Speaker 2:          00:18:19       Even though all, even though Cheney back in 2000 or 1996 said, this is exactly what's gonna happen. If we invaded Iraq, pieces of Iraq are going to fly off Saddam. We can never out him at this point because this is exactly what's gonna happen. So it's like, yeah, you can say that was just a happenstance, but the truth is everyone knew what was gonna happen. So you know.

Speaker 3:          00:18:40       Well, I think that's what he's just saying, that it's difficult to attribute that. Number two, what the United States is responsible for because it's really civil war

Speaker 2:          00:18:49       or based on a complete destabilization and destruction of an entire. The entire pot

Speaker 3:          00:18:54       emulation and entire population that was run by an evil dictator in his homicidal, sociopathic sons and yeah, I mean it was all gross before that to mean more people are dead now, but it was gross. Then it's gross. Now the whole world is terrifying. You know the, the thing about Isis, did you see that shit with a, blew up some ancient structures a couple of days ago. They, they blew up some, uh, ancient monuments. Pull that up because this is fucking terrifying. They beheaded some guy who's the head of antiquities in Syria, uh, apparently this beloved guy who just was unwilling to bow to their demands, they behead this guy and then they blew up some ancient monuments. Some are really well preserved ancient structures that were, you know, archeological treasures. They're blowing these fucking things out of the Taliban. Blew up all those like Buddhist. Now look at this fucking unbelievable. They released the first images showing the destruction of the temple in Balsamiq fuck off. I said that right?

Speaker 2:          00:20:00       It's just insane how rich isis is. Like they've just stolen so much equipment and money. It's just the whole isis thing is so disturbing because it is like, it's like a self fulfilling prophecy. It's like everyone's wanted this, this group of like crazy Islam as that we can look at and be like, look, this is why we need this, like never ending war and isis just be co comes out of the shadows of like destabilizing an entire region of the earth. Um, and this is what happens. It's like this is the manifestation of, you know,

Speaker 3:          00:20:33       well, this is what the tin foil hat people have always been saying. The United States engineer's the United States will prop up a country, prop up a military, and then go in and invade them. One, we got to invade them. They're dangerous. They're dangerous because we made them dangerous. Mean this is the

Speaker 4:          00:20:48       conspiracy theory. Because when you remember when Obama was on tv saying that we had to invade Syria. Yes, only two years ago he was ready to Bama side and we were all like, what the fuck? And the United States. Pretty much universally it was like, fuck it, we're not going into another place. We're not gonna. We're not gonna start another war that we can't win. And then the United States backed off. They just let it go, but then coincidentally, the rise of Isis, like right when that happened. I mean, fuck man. If you wanted to make a conspiracy theory, there's no better one than the isis. It's right in front of everybody's face. It's adorable and how ridiculous it is. Like, and I'm not saying that it's a conspiracy theory. I believe that this is real, but it's amazing how quick it filled the void left by our hysteria to go into Syria.

Speaker 4:          00:21:34       Like, oh, will you reduce our grass bombing and are they using poisonous gas? That was the thing, right? Poisonous gas as well. There's rules how you're supposed to kill people. We'll also why his WMD, that pretense that we should just go in and invade a country. It's like, oh, like the Iraq war. It's so funny because people are like, we didn't find WMD. They light. It's like if we did find WMD is would it have been justified? Then like just because Assad is kind of glove, is that justified to go and fucking invade the country? It's so weird. There was a crazy hysteria. They'll post nine slash 11. That was just undeniable, there's a blood lust than America that couldn't be ignored and then they just pointed it at something. So in Iraq and we were over there before anybody was like, wait, what the fuck? Iraq.

Speaker 4:          00:22:15       Like it didn't make any sense like that had nothing to do with it. Meanwhile, Saudi Arabia, which is where all the fucking hijackers came from, we were like, oil money. We liked those guys. No, no, no. I racked, Whoa, that guy's an asshole. Fuck his son's a piece of shit and they've got oil. Let's get over there, let's go. And then we were over there, now we're in Syria with Isis and Obama just issued this statement saying like, we can now attack Assad forces while battling isis if we need to. So it's just another proxy war that's gotten completely out of hand with future. Look at these people that were training to these FSA people and like, I mean they're beheading people and shit too. They were like acting like Isis. I mean, it's insane. The fsn basically like training all these Syrian. I'm like revolutionaries, you know, all these people in these rebel groups.

Speaker 4:          00:23:07       And then they go over either abandoned post after we spent a shitload of money training them to fight isis or they join isis. It's a complete disaster. Well, it's hard to get Muslims to fight against Muslims. You know, when their core values and their core beliefs in religion are so much a part of their life. And then they have these people that are telling them that you're supposed to fight these people that have the same core values that celebrate Ramadan, that believe in hello, they, they, they have the same ideas that these people. I was like, it's way easier to stick with them and some guy direct some asshole directing you mccain from mother fucker from a DC America, the Great Satan. Those fucking people that have killed a million people in Iraq or whatever the number is. Sam Harris, you know, it's, it's amazing. It's a, it's an amazing quagmire that we're in. Right?

Speaker 2:          00:24:01       It's so interesting though, when you look at like every like civil war that's happened in the last 10 years, like Libya and then you know, you have Ukraine going on Syria. Mccain is just always there playing poker.

Speaker 4:          00:24:11       The hands of the people on the flag in the fucking world. You're like, why are I doing? Who is paying you to be here? My favorite time when he was, they were voting on whether or not we should go into Syria and he was playing poker on his phone number. Hey, yeah. You're just like kicking it on his phone. Imagine you're, you're about to. You're part of a military decision that who knows how many fucking people it's going to kill whether or not it's going to trigger world war three, whether it's going to trigger a new nuclear war and he's playing poker on his phone. He doesn't give a fuck and get a nice water running through his veins hanging out, just kicking it. You know, he, he, uh, is so adorable that he would do that, that he wouldn't think that people would know holding onto a sharpie playing poker on his phone.

Speaker 2:          00:25:03       He's such a piece of shit. He actually tweeted it like someone from his campaign, which is so hilarious, like tweeted at me saying, thank you Vladimir Putin. I see the, just like paying attention to what I'm doing. And He, like basically called me, I was just like a report that I did and I was like, thank you John Mccain, you seen our motherfucker, you just tweeted out a scathing report about your war crimes to like all of your stupid followers on twitter, some idiot running your campaign, like tweeted out this video that just exposed the fuck out of him. It was great. That's hilarious. You tweeted something and he wrote it. I did a giant video just breaking down what? Like a scumbag he is. And um, and he tweeted it out.

Speaker 4:          00:25:41       Oh, so you didn't even tweet. He just tweeted your video. Wow. Wow. It was great. Well that's called damage control. And understand you've got to ridicule the information as Vladimir Putin. Like as if America continues his attacks against me. That's what he said. I'm honored. That's hilarious. Vladimir running our t Vladimir, running my show up. Did you ever meet that dude? You never met him. Did it feel like drip like the fucking Lord Kgb, mother and Dad. I'm done

Speaker 2:          00:26:14       so funny watching him. Every time he does like a sit down, he always just says the weirdest shit. He just like on another level, like Obama tried to crack a joke within. They're sitting at some press conference and it's him and Obama sitting there and he just like looks at Obama and he was like, you're trying to make this funny right now and it's not. Or something like just like completely or Obama's like stay there. Nervously laughing. He was just like, stop doing this. These serious. You're like,

Speaker 4:          00:26:37       okay, kill a lot more people personally than I'm sure. How many people you think that guys killed Obama but not with his own hands to kgb. Anybody knows how crazy that shit is. He doesn't. How many? How many has he personally killed? Yeah, definitely. Apple couple. Probably KGB. CIA, that's for sure. Yeah. I mean like at least George Bush's Dad. Herbert Walker Bush was the head of the CIA. That was a real killer. He was a real stone cold motherfucker. That's a fucking guy. He's winking with the wrong guy to. I don't trust that dominant left eye. What kind of creepy shit is at holding the gun with the right hand? Squeezing the trigger. Like those. I like the photo of the glasses. It always shows those reflect on. Well, you remember when that guy, who's the guy that got murdered in broad daylight with his girlfriend, that was a.

Speaker 4:          00:27:39       nobody remembers that. What happens is he kill pooting. People just forget your name and it just water under the bridge. Just vanish. That's a fucking crazy country right now. Roy Jones Jr is going to be a citizen. Roy Jones Jr is going to be a citizen. Apparently they, this is what he said was just fucking hilarious. He goes, uh, the people of Russia love Roy Jones Jr. I love it when people love me. It's like the dude who went to North Korea. Um, wait, who was that? Basketball player? Basketball. Well, I just Roy Jones as a career over there. He's boxed over there a few times and they like his music. He plays music over there and apparently they enjoy that music. Yeah. So junior trying to get citizenship. They're gonna. Give him citizenship. Good friend edward snowden. You get to your visa, you get a visa for you. Um, so yeah, was probably sucking some kgb dick right now.

Speaker 4:          00:28:41       Keep his visa going to shit. They make that guy do just to stay there. I'm sure nothing dude, they're probably just love that he's there. Don't you think? Just a thorn in the side maybe, but he can't go anywhere. I mean it's not like he can. He can't go anywhere. No, he probably has to like hide wally's. Even in Russia, just for fear of american agents. Just takIng them out. Totally. What pots, what a fucking crazy life end. What's even crazier about it? There's not a goddamn person I've talked to that thinks he did anything wrong. Like what he did was exposed with careful too. He was just like, you know, let all the journalists that everything he was just like, he's make sure that there's no didn't matter. No one's being jeopardized. Not only that, the whole remember the hope and change website. The hope and change website that obama had wheN he's running for president had a whole piece in there about supporting with blowers, transparency and supporting whistleblowers when he was persecuted more than any other president under the espionage act. What happens when you get in there? Did they just show you fucKing ufo landing on the north pole and what do they show you? They show you where all the bombs are being planted.

Speaker 2:          00:29:45       I think that yoU're so someone who has, who is as young and impressionable as obama that at that time, I think he was vetted really early when he was at harvard and I think that um, he just was so fucking young. I mean, what? He was barely even a senator for a term. Right. and he just gets plucked out of obscurity and catapulted to the president's ship president ship precedent ship the presidency. And then he just surrounded by a bunch of fucking. I'm not excusing him at all, I think is a war criminal. I really strongly dislike obama. I think he's like a great manipulator. A bit of a left. Everyone, a little bit of a lefty there. Astronomy, martin, but I definitely think that god, can you imagine who was just surrounding him at all times, like he had hillary clinton barking into zero mccain like these crazy neo-cons who are just like, we need more war and I think that you saw all the neocon establishment really promoting obama until the Syria thing happened where we backed down and that's where you kind of saw this like ridiculous schism where now netanyahu's coming to visit and it's like this crazy, um, where obama's like week now.

Speaker 2:          00:30:44       So that's been an interesting. Or they basically were like, they were pissed off about the Syria thing really well. They were like, look, we're about to have a civil war in America. Yeah, this could get ugly if they invaded Syria, who the fuck knows what would have happened? It would have gotten really ugly in this country. The most. Whoever would Be the most dominant militant force on the ground would rise to power. Just like, well, I mean look at Libya for fuck sake. Baster, total disaster in the past or now. It's a terrifying place now apparently. So it was like, yeah, no one's. I don't think anyone's really defending assad, but it's about people's sovereignty. Right.

Speaker 4:          00:31:19       Amazing. That a guy like you, you look at these dictators and you say, well, no one wants kadafi to stay in power. Obviously it's bad to have kadafi there, and when kadafi got killed, first of all, it was one of the most bizarre and strange moments in social media and in the power of cell phone videos and the ability to distribute information. The fact that they had video of this guy, the thing that. Yeah, and a moments he's dying, the like the moments they captured him and they're all screaming and you're seeing something that no one has ever seen before. No one ever seen a dictator captured by rebels, I guess now. Yeah, it's happened throughout history. It's never been documented and then distributed to everybody. I mean, we could all watch and we could watch it right now. Jamie could pull it up right now and we can kick back and just the comfort of this woodland hills office suite and watch this fucking guy get bain edited in his asshole.

Speaker 2:          00:32:19       Yeah, and it's. It's horrifying and especially this disaster porn that's put out there by like jay sock and this video and yeah, I know the us didn't film the video but it was showed everywhere and we also released photos of saddam's sons with all the bullet holes in them on, on tv and shit. We're like, look like, look what you did that's fucking sick man. And, and you know, we can see isis videos all day long, have these crazy hollywood style sets of where people are getting beheaded and it's like. And you get mowed, jumpsuits and it's like this crazy fucking manifestation of like hollywood culture and the military industrial complex rolled into one, but at the same time you have our military uploading every drone strike on a fucking youtube channel. What are the, what the why are including the ones that kill civilians? Oh, aBsolutely. Yeah. It's like just in case you're wondering what we're doing here, you can watch our youtube channel and see how the people were killing. It's really Weird.

Speaker 3:          00:33:12       Well it's, It's horrific that when you watched her decision making, should we shoot? Should we shoot? Let's just shoot like, well, it's not like that. She's like tRying to figure it out on the fly and then you realize like, this is what precision drone strikes are all about. There's nothing precise about it. This is not surgical. It's like you have a bad person that may or may not be in this area. You have good information that the bad persons in this area let the missiles fly and they fly and then everybody is anywhere near. That guy gets fucked up too and we're Just supposed to accept that because that's just a bad person. We need to get them out. We need to take out the bad person. If other bad people, aren't we a bad person? If we're killing innocent people, it isn't that the whole idea behind shit. I mean it's. It's good to want to protect us against bad people, but that way is bad. Like that's a bad way, but you're saying you have a better word.

Speaker 2:          00:34:01       No, I don't have a better way. I don't have a better way that that. All I know is that isis has gotten a shitload of us military equipment and billions of dollars, so maybe we should stop just a bit like, you know, all of the stuff that we've tried to train the iraqi army, like this isn't working because they're abandoning and like isis is just taking large swathes of equipment and humvees and grenade launchers and shit. So I mean wHen I look at stuff like that happening, it's just like we just need to remove ourselves from the situation and let like allied states that are in the area really take hold of whatever

Speaker 3:          00:34:33       going out the way to do it. I mean there a. Is there justifiable war in your eyes? Like now when you look at it? Oh you mean in general. When you look at what's going on with isis right now, when they're decapitating, the syrian head of antiquities and blowing up these ancient cherished monuments is they're justifiable war there. Are these bad guys? Can you go in there and stop these bad guys?

Speaker 2:          00:34:53       I don't think there is a justifiable war with isis because isis was created out of the vacuum of just a large war and countless casualties and refugees and the civil war thing that happened there. So I think that isis is a direct result of us military intervention. So I think that more us military intervention to stop isis is just going to exacerbate the problem and I definitely do not think that that should be, um, an option whatsoever. Right? But what do you do? Do you let them take over and just start doing more? This is the trick. This is the trick is like, it's always going to be something. first it was all caden. Now it's like, now it's like isis is like pulling it people's heartstrings so much because they're seeing these crazy images and it's like, how can we just sit back and do nothing?

Speaker 2:          00:35:35       The thing is there's genocides happening in Congo. Are we going to go invade and take out the. I mean, it's just like, why are we picking and choosing what we're putting in front of the tv screens and brainwashed and everyone's saying, what are you, what are you going to do about isis? First it was fucking a bolt. What happened to a bulla that was all over the fucking tv and we curate it. Annuity. There's so much going on. I just think to hone in on isis and just say like, we all need to focus on destroying isis militarily is, uh, is just a farce because a, it came out of military intervention and b, we're not going to fucking destroy isis. It's just going to galvanize more people to join isis. That's why they're recruiting is so high across the world. People are just like, fuck tHis. I mean they're being drawn to isis because of the endless warfare going on. So I just think I don't have the answers. I do think that regional players need to take a step in. That means Syria. That means you know, Iraq, people in the region that understand the region are not coming from like this neo colonial lens and just like all we have is military solutions because that's all we fucking know because we're the fucking empire. That's right. Chris got rescued.

Speaker 4:          00:36:51       I don't think that there's any clear solution and I think that's a real part of the problem. I think that everybody who looks at isis decapitating decapitated head of antiquities and blowing up monuments and lighting people on fire with slow motion. Let me just see that video that they did where they have, they have slow motion video cameras like complicated techniques where they're showing these people getting lit on fire. I mean what they're doing is promoting terror. They're trying to scare people and they're doing it with these videos. Videos of decapitations assassinations. Isn't it weird that they put them on youtube, but it just keeps playing them? If it bleeds, it leads as you used to be on the girl. you know how it is. Start a new show. What are you doing? The empire files starting in the empire. Final week and a half. Fucking at counter culture type shit. What are you trying to do with this empire? Files? Fucking

Speaker 2:          00:37:42       dissect the empire. TrY to strip away the layers of the empire. How did we get here? Where do we go from here? How do we. Where do we go from here? MuShrooms. So it's funny because I'm jumping from Russia state television to latin american owned tv. Who owns this one? So this is chavez from the grave. 50 one percent Venezuela and then you have a 49 percent block of like Argentina and I'll play in Costa Rica and Nicaragua and stuff. So it's like a 49 percent owned. So it's a giant latin american block that has telesource, which is the network. And chris hedges just launched a show on it and now I'm launching one called the empire files and it's going to be really great. Everyone check it out. We have all the social media up ready to go. So what's the name of, of network? Tell us or tell us sor, sor as you are. And

Speaker 4:          00:38:36       uh, how do you get it? Do you get it online or do you get it? Unfortunately, unlike our tea, it's not in as many households on tv and cable, so you can just watch it on youtube or if you're in latin America can watch it until the summer. So the upload everything to youtube. Well that's beautiful. That's all you need. Exactly. So you just basically use them for a studio using using their resources to help get the information out about the crazy empire we're living in. so like what kind of shit you going to do? Like investigative reporting type shit going to fly over to these horrible places. So yes. InvesTigative reporting and crimea. Crimea. It's on the ground. She needs to be on the ground and crimea for people that don't know. There was a report that abby was working for rt, which is Russia today. She did this, a very critical piece on crimea and what was going on over there in the Ukraine and they were gonna send her.

Speaker 4:          00:39:29       They said they were gonna send her to cry man. She was like the fuck you are. I live in America. Pitch. Yeah. Just send all vetted russians and shit like go over and you're just like, here's, you know what I mean? I could just imagine how it would be. It would just be like when Jeff Stevenson, shane smith went to North Korea and they like fake restaurant set up for them and just set it up for you. I wanted to talk about the anniversary of the atomic bombs. Okay, sure. Um, what do you think about that? Well, I think it's a fascinatinG moment in history and an amazing moment for amazes me more than anything that we haven't blown up an atomic bomb since 1947. That's the most amazing thing. So somehow or another we have had the brains to go, like, what will, you know, what is that 60, 70, 66 slash 68 years, whatever the fuck it is, 60, 68 years without.

Speaker 4:          00:40:24       And he's put his fucking city. So it glows in the dark. That's kind of crazy. That's amazing. But what, what's truly amazing is how much ignorance was involved in the testing process. The, uh, the, the initial bombs that they blew up in the desert where they had soldiers run at the bombs. Did you ever see those videos on a little like a, like the thinG where you're looking at a solar eclipse, they're just like, I'm your cardboard glasses kids, and it's like 10. Well, the, they had these ones where they would blow up these fake cities and they would have these guys in a trench. They would blow up the fixed cities and thEy would jump out of the trench and then run towardS the blast, which never seen that. Now, if you can find those, jamie, because they're, they're amazing. No, theY didn't do it because they didn't think it was gonna affect them.

Speaker 4:          00:41:11       They were teaching them to run towards the blast. The idea would be that this nuclear bomb would go off. Everybody would be disoriented and fucked up and that these american gis would run in there and take over. These guys all died. Not only did they die, but john wayne died. John the bomb killed john wayne. If you know that no one knows that nuts, the bomb killed the fucking greatest american actor of all time. It's insane. The bomb killed the man who played gangas. Does everyone realize? Yeah, so this is what they would do. They would all get in these trenches. I mean, these are the actual trenches. I mean, it's unbelievable. it's, it's horrific that they had these four fucking soldiers. yeah. It was ridiculous. So they, these gUys, they're playing cards and shooter. Some women just like john mccain and so they blow these things off and when you watched the impact, look at these guys are just ducking their head and so they have this close enough that you see the blast, like super clearly. So they have these fake bodies out there. They're all like drawn japanese likes to watch how this goes off. They set it off and then the guys get up.

Speaker 4:          00:42:30       Oh my god, oh my god. It's right in front of them. I mean, what is it? Fuck five miles away, six miles away, whatever it is, but look at the impact, hits them and then they're closing their ears and then they run towards the blast and those guys are all dead, all of them, and they died young. See the blast hits some. Look at this. Oh my god. This is all nuclear radiation, intense. Super high doses of nuclear radiation. So who knows what happened and then I mean, I'm sure a good percentage of them died of cancer. A few outlier survive because of freak genes, but most of those guys, just liKe the Gipper, not the gipper. What was he? What was it was john wayne. Look at that. Look at that. They're just running toward it. Ronald reagan was the gipper. What was john wayne?

Speaker 4:          00:43:17       Fucking ridiculous. My god. Look at like the. Not just the plume, But those crazy late or smoke formations to the left. I Don't know what those are. You don't want. My favorite one is the one that they did in the ocean. Yeah, the one that they didn't really know how much of an impact it was going to have. The fucking just tRied shit, you know, just like they tried this, see if you could find the, the video of the ocean nuclear explosions that they did. I think they did it off of guam. I think that's where it was. I don't remember though, but they, um, they had all these battleships that they stationed around where the bombs would go off and uh, when they, when they did it, everything got fucked up. I mean, everything anywhere near it got fucKed up. Go for this. Look at this. Look at this comes out of the water. I mean you're talking about like a mile of water straight up in the air and just ignore gulfs that battleship. Yeah. That battleship got fucked up. John lin was the duke, the duke. Oh yeah. I mean, well, it went straight up and straight down, but I'm sure it had incredible repercussions, but look at it just they have no idea they, I mean, they didn't want to waste that.

Speaker 1:          00:44:32       They would try to blow some stuff up underwater and wonder how close they could be while it's happening. Turns out not close. Well, here's all know is that the atomic bomb would obliterate, like incinerate tens of thousands of lives in an instant and that takes, I think it's one of the greatest war crimes that are perpetrated on humanity and I think that's one of the greatest crimes against humanity that's ever been done. And whenever I say This, I went to Japan last year and went to the hiroshima every museum with like an in utero blast survivor and it was one of the most intense museums I've ever been to because we grew up, of course. Yes. Yeah. So, so it was his mother's stomach when she was right there. It was just like a random chance that she just survived and he happens to be fine.

Speaker 1:          00:45:13       Um, but it was such a traumatizing. It's wicked good hearing his arm stretch. Right. I wish that's what it was like, um, it just really, really horrified museum because we grow up. That is probably the biggest myth that we grow up learning is that the bombs were necessary to end the war and that they save lives and it's just like a way to legitimize a really, really horrific atrocity. Um, two of them actually will. The issue is that Japan was already willing to surrender and that we didn't want them to surrender because we wanted to try the bombs out. That's whether or not that's true. That's the bIg debate and that's something that a lot of people still to this day argued back and forth on whether or not it's actually the case. if it is the case, it's even more horrific because just like what they wanted to do in the ocean where they tried that bomb out and watched a mile high wave of water overcome that fucking battleship.

Speaker 1:          00:46:12       They wanted to see what happens when you dropped that shit on a city and they dropped Russia. Their cock. Yeah. They show. Well, I mean it's really, it's, it isn't actually up for debate anymore and this is, this is a problem. It's just like the Iraq war. It's just these people kind of holding onto this last ditch like gasp of air just to hold onto like american exceptionalism and it really just is totally debunked at this point because even truman himself instilled an atomic bomb survey, university of Colorado featured to and of just like dozens of american military experts and leaders, internal interviews, diaries, other declassified materials basically involved in a bomb decision and all of them had one unit unanimous commonality among them that every single one said the bomb was not a military necessity and it did not need to happen for the surrender that Japan was ready to surrender because if you remember, I think like 100,000 or maybe 80,000 people were incinerated in tokyo just weeks prior with the fire bombing.

Speaker 1:          00:47:04       So the u s had already dropped. All these bombs basically eviscerated tokyo and so countless people died way more. People actually died. Then in the initial atomic bomb drops. So it's just, it's just a really, really unfortunate kind of thing that's perpetuated and people just still hold onto it. You know, they say it would have saved lives. It's like, well, it would have saved us soldiers lives, but instead it took like probably half a million japanese. If you look at the countless maimed in radiation poisoning, I mean I think like 80,000 died instantly and with the incineration was something that yeah, it's awful. The only argument that could be said that it saved lives is that a kept other people from using nuclear weapons because there is so horrific. Otherwise you look at all the war that has taken place since 1947 and not one person has used a nuclear bomb.

Speaker 1:          00:47:54       It could be argued that it was because how horrific that was when it did happen with. That's not a really good argument and it's also like irritating that the us is the one fearmongering in the world about like he can't have a nuclear bomb. He can. He can't. AnD it's like, well, you guys are the only ones who have only used them troll weiss. So why are we the arbitrators of who and who cannot utilize nuclear weapons? Well, we're righteous and plus we're one nation under god, chris [inaudible] and patients. Do you. Do you know that we're under god when you know most people don't even know that we became one nation under god after the comedy scare, the 19 fifties. Really the mccarthy scares what led them. To add that to the pledge of allegiance. I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States, one nation indivisible for liberty, and they had one nation under god, indivisible.

Speaker 1:          00:48:43       They had to add that to it. They had to add that to it because of the kami scare. That's unreal. So 19 fifties male. Yeah. Before that. Before the mccarthy hearings, they. They didn't have undergone. Speaking of dirty, insane, insane. What about people that believe in buddha? Right. They don't have the. It's not under them. They ain't. No one needs to be changed it. Then I Just assume that they're going to change it again to one nation under chris kyle is so crazy because it's like, I don't think jesse ventura got like threat saying they're going to cut his bull. They did. No, he did. He got a lot of the horrible death. maybe. I'm sure if I had to guess, that's. I don't know. Man. I think there was a lot of like really don't know what happened though. So explain the, the jesse ventura thing, because a lot of folks aren't aware.

Speaker 1:          00:49:29       Obviously badass navy seal epic. Well he was a navy seal was before it was thought they were both. There wasn't that. He wasn't a navy seal. They used to be, it was something, there was another name for like before know, because it was in the Vietnam era. Yeah. I forget what I'll find out. So, so jesse ventura, I'm total bad ass. Like the opposite of chris kyle. Right. He's like against war. He's really on point. So anyway, chris kyle was ever in a movie slack drawn. Is that in front of me? Yeah. Um, so he and chris kyle's book, it makes up this giant bar fight that he like beat up jesse ventura. And if you know who jesse ventura is, like, he's fucking like a brick house. Well he's an older gentleman too. I mean born in 1951 I think because. Sure. But still, it's like if you're going to fucking go out there and say that you beat the shit out of jesse ventura, you like socked him in a bar, a might be a bad idea. Well, here's what happened. He in the book, he

Speaker 4:          00:50:28       wasn't referred to as jesse ventura. He was referred to a scruffy. He called them scruffy and he was saying that this guy was some celebrity they'd beat up because this guy had said something bad about navy seals. So chris kyle came along and socked him for America. He was a udt underwater demolition team is the original seals. Um, so he said oN the opiod, anthony show that it was chris kyle, but the, chris kyle said that it was a jesse ventura. That's when he was goated into saying who the guy was. I believe it was opening anthony. I'm pretty sure. And I'm in that. That's when jesse ventura said, what? You didn't fucking hit me like we didn't get into a fight. What are you talking about? and jesse ventura sued him and won and won one point $8,000,000. There it is. Jesse ventura wins one point 8 million in damages against chris kyle, celine, navy seal sniper, and here's the issue was that he gave chris kyle the option to, to just to, just to retract it, admit you're wrong, and I'll drop the chris.

Speaker 4:          00:51:34       Carl wouldn't do it. No fucking. And then he was killed. Chris kyle was killed by some, some poor kid with ptsd. Poor kid, asshole murderer. He's a murderer to another guy that fucked up. I mean murdered chris kyle for no reason. Said ptsd. Shot him. Shot the other guy that was with him, stole his truck. I mean he was fucked. War of that level of that scale obviously fucks people's head up. And when he died, jesse ventura continued with the lawsuit and that's where he got criticized and that's you're assuming the widow and all this shit. And they said he was suing the book company. He said he was. He goes, I'm suing everybody that's profiting off of this lie, that scully and his take on it was. PEople also should be aware of the truth of what this guy not, didn't just lie about that, but he lied.

Speaker 4:          00:52:24       I mean, jesse ventura did several inteRviews. We were talking about all the different lies. There's more than one line that book. Absolutely. It doesn't mean that there aren't heroes. It doesn't mean that the military is bad. It doesn't mean that there aren't people that genuinely go into the military like I'm sure your boyfriend did, thinking that they're going to do good, that they have these ideals that they want to protect. They want to protect liberty and they believe in the american way of life and then you know, it all gets convoluted because you're either with us or against us. You're with us or again, it's not. It's not. It's not. That's not us. What you're doing is not as lies, aren't us murder's not us shooting looters, not us. Like these people are making. These decisions are not us. I mean we have more in solidarity with the people in Iraq than we do it. Like the elite that are making these decisions. Yeah. The, the people that are complete neo-cons that are complete chicken hawks that are outside of the consequences of war, the ones pulling the strings. I think that there's a big problem with just the militarization, our society

Speaker 2:          00:53:26       where we have, you know, every sports game has this giant military. I'm just like drama thing going on where we pay tax payer sponsored fucking fighter jets flying over the stadiums and shit. I mean, every single thing is militarized. Um, and we're, when we're conditioned in this way to glorify the military so much that it becomes an, especially when you're at the helm of the empire, thAt is the largest military force in the world that's consolidated like military super power. That's the only solution to everything. A bola sending the fucking military isis, let's bomb them. More riots in the streets or like, you know, sending the fucking militarize riot cops who just got trained next to israeli troops in Bahrain. It's like, good god. I mean we need to start really removing ourselves with this kind of militaristic, I dunno, characterization of our society because it's really fucking toxic man.

Speaker 3:          00:54:21       Well, and also it creates military problems abroad because the rest of the world identifies us with that as well. Of course, if we're doing shit like what we've done in the Iraq war, which whatever the number is, whether it's sam harris is number one that he adheres to or whether it's the one of the far left adheres to a lot of fucking people, right? A lot of fucking people died and that those people, it creates without a doubt, martyrs and it creates without a doubt, support for the opposition because we were looked at in other parts of the world as the dark empire and also if they're muslim and they, they, they support muslim ideals and then they see that these people who are have a completely different faith or attacking and invading their homeland, it's pretty easy to support that. And then they, it Just piles on and next thing you know, we got a problem and we got a current problem and we have a past problem and we've got a future problem and we have a military industrial complex that's just fucking rakesh and allows problems because problems means we may get to make more missiles and more missiles means mum.

Speaker 3:          00:55:28       Money keeps going. I mean money, more problems. Did you ever see the hunter s thompson documentary? No. IT's a gonzo. I think it was called. No, it's. It's great. It's great. It's a great documentary, but one of the best parts about it was mcgovern when he was recounting his, his days with, with hunter, when hunter was writing that fear and loading on the campaign trail and he followed around the press corps for a year, then wrote that book, but mcgovern was just talking about how he was just sick and tired of old men in air conditioned buildings, making decisions that are to send young men off to war and I'll just never forget the way he was saying that. And he's, you knoW, mcgovern when he was doing that thing, you know, he was an old guy when they were doing that documentary. He died 2012, but he was, he was old when they were doing that documentary and he was just saying, I'm just tired of it.

Speaker 3:          00:56:31       I'm tired of. And he died very shortly after that documentary was made some of the last days of his life. And you know, he ran for president and was the seventies [inaudible] 72, I think 70, 72, 72, whatever it was, but it was during the Vietnam war and just that kind of voice and he didn't win. One of the reasons why I didn't win is because his vice presidential candidate turned out that he had undergone shock therapy, electrical shock therapy, and kind of hid that from everybody. And it came out during the campaign, but he was ahead. Mcgovern was a head and part of the reason why he was ahead, it was because hunter was supporting them and hunter was writing for the rolling stone and he would write crazy shit. like that was where he wrote about ed muskie who was also running for president. He was saying that ed muskie was bringing in brazilian doctors and they were treating him for his ibogaine. Okay. Addiction.

Speaker 4:          00:57:26       I've been addicted to ibogaine scenes. No one even kneW what it was back then. Ed muskie was clearly exhibiting signs and it was really funny because they interviewed hunter on one of these in the documentary. He's on one of these talk shows. He goes wearing, well there was a rumor that a ed muskie was addicted to ibogaine and I started the rumor, but he was at journalist, but it wasn't, I mean he was a journalist, but he was also, he was writing fiction but easily like I thought everybody knew, everybody knew it was bullshit. He's my favorite of all time. He's one of my favorite people that ever lived and uh, he just, he knew it was bullshit and, but he thought it was. Other people knew it was bullshit, but he also knew that he could make an impact with this. So he thought that he thought that muskie was just fucking ridiculous hack.

Speaker 4:          00:58:18       So he just mocked him and, and talked about him being under the throes of this addiction that they had brought in this brazilian doctor and, and then musky, like have these breakdowns on the campaign trail because he was dealing with. Because nobody had ever dealt with that kind of negativity from the press before. Nobody ever running for president had dealt with just someone fabricating craziness about them. And it's the pressure of this. You could tell he wasn't. I don't even know where to start. If you run for president and you don't have a thick skin, if you can't deal with people getting mad at you on twitter, making shit up about you and the huff post or whatever they would want to do you. You really shouldn't be running for president. You have to develop some sort of rhinos scan at this point, but back then they were paper.

Speaker 4:          00:59:00       That was. People didn't know what the fuck to do. There's only been a few presidents that were on tv and they don't have the billion dollar campaigns where they're like, have a spin master training. When you think about 1972, how many fucking presidential candidates had even been on television? You know, jusT a few decades worth. It was so recent. It was all so fucking recent. These poor bastards didn't know what to do. Now, look at it. Now. Look at this fucking dog and pony show. Now you get obama doing the mark marin podcast, which are super crazy. Isn't it bizarre? Yeah. Just go right to her. No, I listened to a little bit of it. I didn't listen to him. Oh, just knew it was all going to be soft balls and bullshit and all boat, you know, America. You just funny where obama's going for the audience.

Speaker 4:          00:59:44       It's like advice, you know, sitting down with shane smith and Mike Moran. I mean they, he has good people telling them where people are at that come in here and smoke a joint wIth me. Barack obama down fucking scared podcasts. Do mushrooms experience sue just a little mushrooms runs child's play compared to compare to this? Well, I don't know if I would do it. I would feel weird about it. I mean I would definitely do it if you want to do it, but it wouldn't pursue it and if I. But I just don't know what you could ever get out of that. like what you. You're never going to get trained like a vader. You know what I mean? Like everything you'd say would just be going on. You would had some serious fucking enemies if you really went for it. Like that is the last person in the world you want to like put a.

Speaker 4:          01:00:32       You want to put you in a book or a category, right? Like this is. he's on the fuck with lists. I traveled too much in the world. arguably right up there. The most powerful figurehead in the world, if not the most powerful. Certainly top four or five. Just thought of something really fucking crazy. The bomb that we stopped being an atomic bomb that those obviously dropped on hiroshima and nagasaki. We have. That's Like fucking babysit. Oh, hydrogen? Yeah. Thirty 300 times stronger. I don't even. I don't even understand. Thirty $300. what would that even do? Like picture what we just saw exploding that little battleship. Like what the fuck? Well, how do we have that? I don't know. I don't know. I mean, I guess we want to kill better. Better at it. The more fucked up is the research they've done into anti-matter weapons.

Speaker 4:          01:01:24       Ooh, that's really crazy. Because we don't know whether or not that's the. This is just theoretical guy. Bring me one of them. Alcohol beverages to young jamie. Um, we don't know whether or not it's theoretical or whether this is actually a proof of concept. Whether anti-matter can be developed into a weapon, we do know there's research being done on it and when they do develop anti-matter research, I mean when they do develop anti-matter weapons, whether it's in our lifetime or in the future lifetimes, you're talking about a world destroyer. We're talking about something they might just shoot over at pluto like, you know, it'll take nine years and we'll watch pluto blow up from the sky just to see if we can do it. That's very possible. They might do that someday. Just decided to launch it in some fucking planet. Well, do you know that that's your justification for continuing the trillion dollars that they're going to spend just updating and refurbishing the nuclear arsenal is that they keep doubling down on the fucking star wars fantasy that reagan had. Gorbachev went

Speaker 2:          01:02:19       to reagan and he was like, let's disarm. Let's fucking end it. And reagan was like, no, I'm senile and I want to create this giant star wars program that's going to like, you know, like the shield and the sky and we're going to do this and that. And everyone was like, all right, never going to fucking work. And of course it didn't. But that's still like a dress of vacation to battle asteroids to have these nuclear weapons here and continued to.

Speaker 4:          01:02:41       Yeah. Video game, asteroids out when you know, they say that if you do blow up an asteroid, the real issue is you're going to create more asteroids. Just mass. Like you have a, you have, you have something, you don't relate it. If you have something that has masked, it's five miles across, you're going to develop a 100, you know, half mile ones or whatever you know, or 500 yard ones and they're going to kill everybody to. They're going to come down. It's going to rain metal and rock from the sky. Do you mean people that don't know what an asteroid is? A lot of them are iron. They're metal, they're just giant chunks of metal and you fucking space. It's a trip where here's a great theory for her. Great conspiracy. That is actually true. Fuck, go ahead. Go ahead. Yeah, we're good. Go ahead.

Speaker 4:          01:03:30       Just do your p and we'll have jamie pull this up to pull up. I want you to pull up this star wars scientists that have been killed, star wars scientists that have either been murdered or committed suicide because what's really fascinating about the star wars program, and I'll have to at least slightly reiterate this, when young abby martin gets back because I don't think she was completely aware of this, but when the star wars weapons defense system was created, the idea behind it was the United States was going to create a military. They were going to create some sort of a military solution with satellites that could shoot these missiles out of the sky. Now while they were doing it, they were spending fuck loads of money on this and apparently it was never effective and if you could pull up the numbers, just pull up like there's a list of all the star wars.

Speaker 4:          01:04:33       See if he could find a better article. See like that. Who killed all the star wars scientists here. See if you could find out who go to a like a rent is rents legit. Ariana see isn't like a super conspiracy website, mysterious deaths of scientists like scientists killed, star wars scientist murdered, killed, but a giant number of them have all been killed. Let's see. I don't know, like, what's a good, what's a good like website for this? We should probably find a good one because there's so many fucking goofy conspiracy theory websites that lumped a star wars people in with um, chem trails. So the, the star wars program, the, the theory being the star wars program has apparently never really effective. And the scientists that were behind the star wars program, a fuck load of them died by suicide, by murder. And there's a giant list of them and it's one of the most fascinating conspiracies, modern time to find it.

Speaker 4:          01:05:47       Okay. Um, these guys that knew the people that knew the scientists, the engineers dead, like almost all of them, they all died like murdered suicide and like very, very suspicious. And someone did like a number, like, you know, they did like a percentage, like what are the odds that all these people were murdered inside of billion to one? Yeah. Well, they knew, they all knew that it was bullshit it star wars program. They'd spend millions, untold billions of dollars to develop this completely ineffective system to shoot missiles at a sky. It was never proven to work ever. And those scientists are all dead of food. Here it goes. Dead scientists. And look at us. There's the list mark coney scientists mystery, the 19 eighties over two dozen science graduates and experts working on the marconi or plessy. How do you say that? Plessy pls, cc plus sss.

Speaker 4:          01:06:43       Why defense systems died in mysterious circumstances, most appearing to be suicides. The mod denied. These scientists had been involved in the classified star wars projects and that the desks were in any way connected. But look at how these guys died. I'm look at this guy, computer programmer. I'm keith bowden, scientists and uh, at essex university engaged in work for marconi, bubba blah, circumstance of death, fatal car crash was vehicle went off out of control across a dual carriageway and plunged into a disused railway lines. Mean didn't even drinking witH family and friends. Denied the allegations. So what the fuck was it were? Where's the autopsy? Coroner report, accident. Here's another one. Literally a lieutenant colonel anthony, godly expertise, head of work study unit at the royal college of military science, circumstance of death disappeared mysteriously without explanation. I presumed that that's fucking expertise. Radar designer and droughts, men draftsman, I guess as draftsman droughts, men with marconi, circumstance of death, death by shotgun, blast at home corners, verdict, suicide.

Speaker 4:          01:07:50       jonathan walz, 29 expertise digital communications expert who had worked at gdc and had british telecom, secret research center at the blah blah, blah, blah, blah. Here's his light. Yep, exactly. Deiter result of falling from a hotel room in west africa working for british telecom. He had expressed fears that his life was in danger, corners, verdict, open, and it just goes on and on and on. Look out. you see how? See scrolling, look how's as jamie's growing, look at the upper right hand corner. Look how fucking long this list is like. Scroll down to the bottom of this list so you can see how many people were on this. Oh my god. Look at this. This is all a lot of people that were attached to the star wars program, all of them in the late eighties and the early nineties, dead as fuck.

Speaker 2:          01:08:38       Kramer, David Kelly [inaudible], the guy who basically said that there were no wmds and jen and he found it was found dead.

Speaker 4:          01:08:46       Oh yeah. Yeah. That's fucking sketch does a lot of those people. That's what happens with the people are like interested in going over to some place that we don't belong. Killing people. The idea that you're not going to kill you because you want to stop them from killing people like crazy. that's crazy talk. It's a very good way to say. How about pat tillman? I mean there's pat tillman's brother believes that pat tillman was killed because he was speaking it because it was a very public figure and then you speaking out against them.

Speaker 2:          01:09:15       You know, that's going back to the chris kyle thing because every single myth that has been resurrected out of the Iraq invasion has been like, you know, the pat tillman thing, they were so hard, hard on for pat tillman because he really was a fucking here. I mean he's abandoning like a million dollar career to go fight him because he really believed it and he's really fucking smart and he realized that it was based on lies and shit and he had this diary and it's an incredible documentary that just talks about his transition and people who knew him and when he was changing his mind and he had this diary all written up and they fucking burned it. Dude, when they killed him, if they did, they say it was friendly fire, who knows? But his brother thinks that it was targeted. I don't know, but he definitely would have come out and been like another, like chomsky, like he would have come out and said he would have been a figurehead against the war and he died from friendly fire and then they burned all of his shit. They burned his diary so we could set that is fucking crazy. And then look at the Jessica Lynch thing. Remember her? Yeah. And they said she was raped and all of a sudden then she was like, the rocky, like military was like helping her just put it on in a hospital. And like taking care of her, then they've staged that whole, like

Speaker 4:          01:10:23       the narrative was that she was trapped and she was being kidnapped by the iraqis and that the United States military went in and rescued her and she was his hero and she was paraded around on television, but she spoke out against it and she got death threats and she essentially vanished and she just went quiet on it and they never talked to her again. It's so sad too, because they chose her. They're like, we're going to prop you up as this person. And it's like, what are you? She just got swept up in it. It's just so crazy the idea that they would just do that to someone and, and, and force them into some sort of a situation like that, you know, I just don't understand why they would think that you would just play along. I guess they just assume like we're goiNg to kill people or they're telling you to do this or telling you to do that. And it was one of the first times that we had women in active duty two and you know, in, in combat duty. Yeah,

Speaker 3:          01:11:14       totally. Yeah, totally. Just not a lot of. I mean, when you're, when you're dealing with death and you're dealing with what you would call a sanctioned murder, right? I mean that's what like if, if you're in the military and you are supposed to go over there and shoot some bad guys, whether they're good or bad guys, you're going to go murder those people. Right? That's sanctioned murder and it's one of the weirdest things about civilization is that we salute sanctioned murder. Murder is awful when you don't like someone and you killed them. We want to lock you up. But if we tell you you can kill someone as long as it's written down on paper. And we all collectively agree, but we don't really collectively agree. That's where it gets weird as a small group of people that decide who you can and can't kill and then everybody else has to fall in line. Well, if those people were beyond reproach, if they were these incredibly enlightened people that had only our best wishes and hopes in mind and could, could not make a bad decision, but then it makes sense to just give into them. They're smarter than us. We're the ants and they're, they're the, they're the geniuses and we'll just follow along. But that's not the case. It's never been there.

Speaker 2:          01:12:22       No, and the thing that bothers me about the obama administration is that he, he's famed as this like transparency president. You know, we talked about the whistleblower thing. It's like everything is the opposite of what it is. It's like this, our wellington new era where you have the nsa's spying now, like the patriot act sunsetted. We think that the patriot acts over. It wasn't, it was just that the clause that they were able to illegally spinus through the nsa in the patriot act expired, and then they just passed a new law to basically codified legal spine just through another caveat. It's called the freedom act, so that,

Speaker 3:          01:13:00       and you can't vote against the patriot act either because the name is just like, what? You're not a patriot, you don't like freedom, but you don't want to answer not, not freedom. Yeah, nope. Who do you want? You want death, what do you want? Destruction. So it's like, wow,

Speaker 2:          01:13:14       the prisoner to pass the freedom act like, yeah, of course we'd been torturing people. There's been wars, there's been extrajudicial assassinations but never before has it been like openly codified and like legislated executively. You know what I mean? So it's almost this weird era of normalization and conditioning where people just accept this as a new normal, like the empire and just the post nine slash 11 era. We just do these thiNgs now and it's all legal, right? It's illegal because we've created all these legal caveats to do them. So what is legal? That's when it gets weird. It's just like what is legal and what's not legal? They write it down. It's legal tender pentagram just issued this field manual to basically for all the branches in the military and in it. I guess because citizen journalism is on the rise and it's really hard to distinguish like who is like an official established journalist are not are who's like embedded with the enemy and they basically said that journalists can be killed legally now by a us military personnel. That crazy. Yeah. That's in the new pentagon arms.

Speaker 4:          01:14:14       Well that was one of the things that happened during the obama obama administration that, that they started at assassinating american citizens without trial. You know, if they were to due process and you know, the rule of law and as long as you're over there though, they can just assassinate you drone strikes. What, how is this? It's I, I get it. If they're absolutely honest and beyond reproach and the most enlightened beings in the world that are dictating what these actions would be. I mean if you have some fucking hitler character over there and you want to assassinate him, I get it. That makes sense to me. You know, you want to us in the loop and be like, look, this guy's hitler. two point. Oh, is black and classified Mrs. Martin. he didn't. You work for Russia when you boot on the ground that continues as a tax against him. Like john, he's barely paying attention. He had his aide do that while you're still in the middle of poker. Yeah. He doesn't know how to tweet. Probably barely. Seaweeds. Do you think he tweets? I don't think. I don't think obama tweet either. Tweets now. It doesn't actually touch this key. I would hope he has better shit to do.

Speaker 4:          01:15:23       That was obama's tweeting emoji. Smiley face. Imagine obama tweeted, just as there's only a smiley face, a pile of dog shit. And uh, god, what does that mean? That's my life. What does it mean? Everybody would dissect it forever. When They look back at us in the future, when they, you know, civilizations 100, 200 years from now, look back at what were, you know, when we look back at world war ii, looking at these people that were running towards this bomb, now we look at him like, fuck man, these poor bastards. You. What are they going to think about us? When is that going to not be the case?

Speaker 2:          01:15:59       Yeah, I don't, I dunno, I dunno, I was just thinking the other day about like, you know, reality tv and how back in the day we had like the fat lady at the circus and like the bearded lady, it's just like we'd still have that. It's just in, in the realm Of reality television. We're trying to empathize with like this fat lady, but really we're just watching like a giant whale, live her life and, and like it's just like the circus and it's the same with um, you know, horror movies and shit, like we don't have the coliseum but we still like people being ripped limb from limb and blood and fucking guts. It's something about us and, and yeah, it's evolved through technology but it's still that weird innate human trait that I don't really understand.

Speaker 4:          01:16:40       Yeah. We love oddities and we also love people suffering when we're not because we're good. I'm not there. Yeah, right. Like, let's wait, like I'm watching intervention because I've watched the sunshine, the episode of the girls doing the duster and I'm like, alright, I guess I don't feel bad about smoking weed because. Yeah. Have you ever seen that? Fucking my strange addiction does this shit exists in the third world are. Fuck, that's a good question. I don't know. It's a very good question. I wonder what what it is about human beings that when everything is great and you have too much resources and it's too easy to get food, we just start getting really fucking strange. I'm addicted to eating dry wall. I mean that's what I want to know. I'm wondering, you know like it almost seems like the, my strange addiction one is like almost like, well having worked in reality tv and knowing how much of it is bullshit, how, how does that work?

Speaker 4:          01:17:43       Because it just super shit will. even when, when I did that saifai show, they fucking just fake things like your reaction shots and shit. I always wonder if you're like, people are like, they definitely edit things and put certain reaction things where they don't, where they didn't belong. To just have to face the way he's looking at what. There was one where they did without a sci fi show that I did where they. There's a thing that people believe in called sky quakes, and this is probably bullshit, most likely, but sounds from the sky, like a crazy like horns and people trying to figure out what these sounds were. Well, they took a video. This is one guy sending this video where he was just. It was actually, it's really hilarious because the one guy that they put the video, he was like a chem trail believer, so he believes in a different kind of bull shit and he was pointing at the sky and we kind of mocked him for his camp trail beliefs, but then these fucking dummies that made the show that the editors took a chunk of this guy's video and then added some sound to it and then put it on the show and said that he was pointing to a sky quick, but he wasn't.

Speaker 4:          01:18:46       it was just fate and I found out about it. I freaked out. I had them remove it from the show, but it aired the first time it aired. That was on the show and then after it aired, when they aired it for a second time, they removed it. So disingenuous. That's what they do and that's what they do. That's what those shows are. Those shows are just bullshit and most of those shows are bullshit. And saifai at the time had a ton of those. There was one show that was all about a family that was trapped in a house in Maine because there was werewolf's outside and it was a whole like fucking half hour show about these people just will, you know, I looked out my salt, it was standing up and it looked like a man, but it was covenant for just making things up and that was the whole shit.

Speaker 4:          01:19:31       They don't give a fuck as long as they could get that toyota truck commercial on a toyota. Then we got tied and then we got a fucking hot dogs. Alright, go back to the werewolf stories. I understand joe because I had an agent for a little while looking for work and stuff and every single thing because I guess I come from like the same, you know, questioning government narratives and oh shit, you're a tinfoil hat where if you fucking question where the government tells you, and so it's always these shows. They're like, we're starting to show to basically dissect like jfk and chem trails and like, isn't there anything else fucking happening other than like that same five fucking things that you guys want to create shows around? it's so weird. No, there's not. No. That's what all these god damn things are and it's all just bullshit.

Speaker 4:          01:20:14       It's like, why don't we talk about shit that fucking matters are like interesting stuff that's going on now because those things are like, they can start fires, you know, it's like you could start fires with the flint and in a, you know, a piece of metal clink, clink, clink and they know it works. So they just keep going to it over and over again. You can start a fire with bigfoot, put big foot on tv and people, oh look good, and they're just drawn to it loses a ufo. It says it's real. There's just certain subjects that people will always want to believe and they want to believe in psychics. They want to believe in chem trails, ufo the government experiments, the mind control. Don't you know about majestic twirl government was there. I'm sure there's been some mind control experiments. There was definitely those lsd dude, mk ultra where they were just watching people fucking like a, like a whorehouse and liked like dosing them with acid and then these fbi agents would sit behind like one way mirrors and just watch him operation midnight climate in that class.

Speaker 4:          01:21:10       It must be really cool to be an fbi agent during the fucking. They dose people with acid. When they went to whorehouses guys went to whore houses. They would slip acid in their drink and you know, they really didn't really want to sex anymore. Thinking about life, existential angst is really kind of true that the us government has like half the world is lsd. Is that, is that a bullshit? Well, it's most likely bullshit. Here's why it's bullshit because lsd as a half life and it doesn't last. If you have a, a vat of lsd and you leave it in your house for 10 years and most likely it's not really effective after aWhile, so them having that, they seized a bunch of it. Really good asset during that whole time, but I guess yeah, sure they did. Yeah, but it wouldn't unless they figured out some way to contain it.

Speaker 4:          01:21:58       Vacuum seal it in some special way. I don't know. I'm guessing. No, as far as I know of, I don't think like, I think a lot of substances or just not. That's why vitamins, if you get vitamins, like most vitamins, you look at them, they're not really effective after like six months or a year to become less and less effective over time. Right. pretty sure that's the case with lsd. Don't quote me on though, but I know it is with weed I've gotten. yeah. Unfortunately it doesn't last. It's like life. You got to get it fresh and young. Get that carbon in the fucking possible. Yeah, even edibles, they go bad. Even if they break them down into a cookie, put that cookie in a piece of plastic, try to eat it. A couple years from now we'd we just. So we just took this epic road trip and got back this morning, which was amazing that I. I wanted to tell your audience about the Utah thing because it was so funny. I mean here you are in these fucking massive like rock formations carved by millions of years of water, sandstone, fucking whatever. Like slate all this shit insane. Like anyone who has not been to Utah, you need to go. Bryce canyon national park is one of the most absurd things I've ever. It's like these things called the

Speaker 2:          01:23:06       hoodoos that are just carved over millions of years at the stone. Anyway. Arches national park obviously that iconic, like all the, the orange arches that are carved in millions of years like we can carbon date them. We know the geological processes very easy to explain through science. So we're reading the official park literature and I'm just like, man, I'm like so, so fascinated. Like how did this form? AnD so like crazy and it makes you just like, appreciate time. Like that's what the desert is like. you fucking appreciate time. Like that is as you look at that. And that's the top of the grand staircase, joe. That's the newest part of the grand staircase. That's amazing. So in, that's fucking ridiculous. It looks like a standing army.

Speaker 4:          01:23:42       Yeah. A few people that are just listening to this. what would it looks like? Obviously it's not, but it looks like something that someone has designed. Looks like something someone carved out of the stone. Like some of those things look like insane. Yeah. They look like columns in a building.

Speaker 2:          01:23:58       It's amazing dude. Um, and so in you, so this is all Utah of course, named after some mormon guy named bryce who discovered it, you know, so anyway, there's arches arches that are created by just wind and time. That's what you like the most. The most crazy thing aboUt being out in the desert for as long as you, you're just like, this took millions of years to, to happen. I mean, it makes you just appreciate fucking time and evolution and like how the earth has changed and this is only think about how old the earth is. BillioNs of years old. this was only the last couPle of million. If you look at something called the black canyon, which is actually way deeper than the grand canyon and way more narrow. I was just like, oh my god, this must have taken billions of years to form. And it was just like, nope, just the last 2 million years just popped up.

Speaker 2:          01:24:39       It's like, what the fuck? It just makes you, it just makes you just appreciate like time, time and geology and science. So anyway, and this official park literature and arches, it explains everything very, um, precisely at the very end of it. It's just like, okay, we just explained how all this worked. This is the history of arches national park. And then it says probably all of the evidence is circumstantial. And I was just like, what the fuck? I was like, whaT do you mean? All the evidence is circumstantial. It's like all the evidence is not circumstantial. Evidence is proven. We know how old these rocks are, we know exactly what's carved them. We can test all the sediments, we can test all the rocks. So I was just like, holy shit. Like has the mormon lobby just lobbied all the fucking parks in Utah, which are the best parks in the country and the most amazing state. And basically forced them to say, none of this is real.

Speaker 4:          01:25:32       It was 14 years old. He found golden tablets containing the last work of jesus. The israeli people came over from the bering strait and siberia. That's crazy. That's the narrative for the mormons. Do you know that, that the lost tribe of Israel with the native americans,

Speaker 4:          01:25:54       you didn't know that they even tested. This guy was as rich mormon dude tested native american dna to try to prove that they were israeli and that they were the lost tribes of Israel. And turns out that's not true from siberia. They came over from the berIng strait and we've known that forever, but they, uh, they tested it. But in a of Joseph Smith, he found magic tablets and he had a magic stone and he could. He had a seer stone and only he could read the magic that he wouldn't let anyone else see them. Trust me. Well, not only that, he got game needed a stone to look at them guys. Seer stone got it serious. It's a wonderful story. A wonderful stone. I wish I had one. Two angels came and took the tablets away because the people didn't believe

Speaker 1:          01:26:46       the test. Our faith like dinosaur bones, they're just like, just got to trust in joseph smith's seer stones. Fucking batshit crazy, dude. Can you imagine him? Just wondering, can you imagine Joseph Smith today walking around with a seer stone being like, I found these golden tablets.

Speaker 4:          01:27:07       well, what's really wonderful is that a follower, this jackass almost became president. Got real. Goddamn. That's fucking batshit crazy. The people that don't even know how bad shit. Mitt romney, mitt romney's family is living in Mexico. His family is all from Mexico. That's why his dad was never president. Mitt romney's dad wanted to be president. Mitt romney's family was one of the fucking mormons that escaped America. When they made polygamy illegal, they will like, look, I need more than one poser.

Speaker 1:          01:27:36       Oh god, it's too much this. It's true. That's what happened.

Speaker 4:          01:27:42       Do you know that? Didn't know that. Mitt romney's family, they still live in Mexico. Mitt romney's dad is from fucking Mexico. He was born in Mexico. There's a huge white looking will american from the escape back when there was nO cars. Got it. See, there was no cars and back when there was no cars. You're on a horseback in America. You're on horseback in Mexico. What difference does it make? But if you cross this dirt wind, you could fuck nine different chicks and live in a house where you, you know, you all have your own rules. Well, to this day they're over there. There's a whole colony of them and they're at war on a regular basis. There's mitt romney's cousin over there in Mexico. That's kelly romney. They're playing golf with fucking armed guards because the cartel kidnaps them all the time. Your wives waiting inside, well, they get kIdnapped by the cartel war. These people, they have these ranches and their arm to the dick.

Speaker 5:          01:28:38       Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:28:40       She's aware of it that way. I don't owe this advice. Is shane over their areas wandering around in Mexico actually has a really interesting story because he at bain capital when he ran bain capital, um, he was taken in and trained by monsanto executives and he, he like, I think he was given his first big loan by monsanto executive. Then he was like, all right y'all, you guys are fucking toxic chemical company, fucking agent orange, all this shit. Real bad, real bad. look, why don't we shift this over to food now? So like he basically was behind this giant pr push to switch monsanto over from chemicals to biotech, which is really interesting to be like, why was mitt romney's in the fold? You know, it's just like super weird that he was just like right there in the wings kind of helping foster this transition is super weird. People witH money paying capital, harvesting money. That's what he says in some commercial for bain capital. He was like, we harvest and money,

Speaker 6:          01:29:34       like, oh my god, how do you show us where the money tree? I can't. It's near the golden tablets. Need a seer stone to see the magIc money tree seeds only through this tiny seeds. We water it with angel tiers and piss

Speaker 1:          01:29:54       fuck money tree harvest. What are you doing? Cash. What are you doing? mit? It sounded like he was harvesting human beings. It's like we grow that planned parenthood goes and for us the whole thing is ridiculous. Hilarious. Yeah. The planned parenthood thing, we were talking about it earlier in a different podcast. We were trying to figure out what the fuck was going on with them. What are they supposed to fucking do? Throw the baby's in the trash case. What? I said, yeah, like I would like them to you if they are, if abortion is legal and I think it should be. What are they going to do with the tissue? Wouldn't it be better if that tissue gets used, but it's a fucking super disturbing video when they start going through the parts and you realize what abortion really is like, oh, this is in canadian. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:30:41       More convenient for me to think that this is a bundle of cells don't really want to see. The whole thing is just like, yeah, it's like abortion is legal and I would rather have them utilize the tissue for something that's scientific instead of just throwing the garbage can. So yeah, that's. That's true. I think what a lot of people were worried about, not just this is that they were going to somehow or another influence people to do it for money influence people to have abortions for money. Oh god, that's insane. It is, but it isn't. There's got to be people that are willing to have an abortion for money. What dId they get paid? Like? Planned parenthood wasn't the whole issue that planned parenthood was making money, selling the tissue, but then they said that that wasn't true. Something along those lines. If there was like some black market thing where people can have abortions and like sell the tissue, I just don't. Yeah, it's super confusing because the video implies that planned parenthood was profiting off of it and that this woman was trying to say that she could sort of structure it so they can make more money. Look, all I know is planned parents fucking great. Okay. I, I love it. I think it gets important. Right? And people wHo want to talk shit. Um, planned parenthood isn't talk about this baby thing. It's just so ridiculous because I didn't have healthcare for like three months after I quit tea and I

Speaker 4:          01:32:00       was on birth control and I was just like, what the fuck would I do? What would I do if planned parenthood wasn't here, I wouldn't have helped them control. How about working for somebody other than Russia extends your benefits. There's some shit that you need prescribed. You don't have unemployment. Broken for lunch. Just go fucking up certain birth controls at this, at the convenient store. It was rush limbaugh that killed rush limbaugh's career, wasn't it? We was talking about some girl beer. See that too, but he was talking about some girl being a slut because she wanted birth control, so college student member, that was like 2012. That was the dropoff. That was where it ended for rush limbo. Oxy didn't do it. That did it. Yeah. He was seeing a bunch of really rude shit. Boys probably oxford out of his fucking head while you're saying it, you know, are coming in your nose, but that, that literally like ended his career.

Speaker 4:          01:32:58       That was like aRound 2012, if I remember correctly. I'm trying to remember what the story was, but it was some college girl and he was calling her a slut and I think it was a rape victim or no, no, no. I think it wAs even over the top rush. Chris commerce. I think what he wanted to do was he wanted to. He was mocking her because she was saying that a birth control should be a part of something. See if he could find that rush limbo college girl slot birth control. Google that, right? Yeah. It was like he was. She was saying that it should be a part of her health care. I think he was calling her a slut because she wanted birth control. Right? Like what? Thirty? What the fuck, man, you wanted to get pregnant. You dumb. Fuck. Exactly. Oh, she shouldn't have sex. Some state just issued free birth control. Did this radical idea where they gave free birth control to women and portion like fucking plummeted, like 30 percent, like teen pregnancy plummeted. It's like, wow, who fuck it. Fuck it. Airbrushed. Limo co's, georgetown student yet let's not get a video. Let's see what the. With the actual facts work, I want to go ahead and play it. Play the audio good

Speaker 7:          01:34:19       for two days. Rush limbaugh has a visceral sandra fluke on the radio. What does it say? College coeds. Susan fluke. Sandra goes before a congressional committee and essentially says that she must be paid to have sex. What does that make her pain? Eps. It makes you a slut, right? When you say to a prostitute, she wants to be paid to have sex. fluke. A third year law student at georgetown is now the flashpoint in a debate about whether employers should be required to fully cover contraception. Even if they have religious jack. How truncate she wants to get

Speaker 4:          01:34:58       paid to have sex. That was it. That was basically it for him. That fucking killed him. That guy has done. It's really fascinating because rush limbo was, oh yeah, he's darling. Oh yeah. His career is dropped off radically. He's in like third, fourth tier markets beheaded. Whoa. Comment. like it was like that bad with that guy. That guy. He's always putting sros. Yeah, but yeah, that was just. He was trying to be funny and stupid. russia's trying to like push his ideology, but that killed that guy, that guy, like advertisers fleed him in mass after that. That's what did it. Not the rampant racism and what is just what he was also calling for drug addicts to be like. There was a guy who got prosecuted. I forget what the story was, but a guy who got prosecuted for some drug related offense and the.

Speaker 4:          01:35:54       The fucking judge literally told him when he was sentencing him that he was listening to rush limbaugh on the way over and how Russia was saying that we have to give drug abusers a wake up call and that drug abusers need to know that there's consequences for their actions. So because of this I'm going to fucking sentence you for x amount of blah blah, blah, blah, blah. And the guy got released because of overcrowding. I read it online. I forget where I read it from either drug abusers really, but this was right before rush got popped for julian, like 90 oxies a day and having his fucking made go out and buy him forum under assumed names. She's wearing a fake mustache. so good. And she's buying. This guy was like talking about this crazy shit on the radio while he was popping pill is how it is, man.

Speaker 4:          01:36:45       All the anti gay people only have the gay prostitutes. it's like, why are you so obsessed? We were playing ted cruz earlier on the earlier podcasts and I was like, I recognize sounds okay. There's certAin sounds I recognize right when you. When you hear a, do you think of a big black man? Right? When ted cruz talks, I hear a gay man. I hear a gay man is how he. Why is he talking? Let's hear. Let's hear ted cruz because he's gay. I think he's gay. He's super conservative, super conservative, but my thought is this guy cannot fucking wait to get done talking. just run up thrawn some women's clothes and suck some cock. He just sounds gay. Now. I don't know if he's gay, but I've never met anybody. That sounds great. It's not gay, so nothing wrong with being gay. I want to say this again because I sit on the earlier podcasts. There's nothing wrong. I'd love gay people, but I don't like is people are gross. We just don't like or homophobes and

Speaker 8:          01:37:39       today is that we need to reassemble the reagan coalition. We need to bring together all of the different parts that comprise big 10 about liberals who got elected president. You'd be their president when we can say to them, well but, but listen, there are different elements. So you've got, for example, you've got to bring together and libertarians,

Speaker 1:          01:37:56       you've got differing views but shared values. Okay. That's about as straight as he's ever sounded. Find a better one. But it's same sex marriage ruling because there's a same sex marriage ruling. He's trying to fucking straighten it up. He's lIke, I don't want to be confused with any of those. The guy sounds gay. I don't know if he is gay. There's nothing wrong with being gay, but he sounds gay. I'm just saying it and people could say, I sound gay to go ahead and say it. I don't give a fuck. The world is on fire. Comments to route them. Fire. Here we go.

Speaker 9:          01:38:31       And I will tell you, you are a major celebrity there. Yeah. Well it's a very small state.

Speaker 1:          01:38:35       I mean it was

Speaker 9:          01:38:37       impressive. I mean I was earning major script street cred. I mentioned to a couple of folks I was going to be on your show. They were blown away.

Speaker 1:          01:38:44       That sounds totally. He sounds totally different than any nation. Being naked with a fucking apron on baking. Wow. Baking and sucking cock. That's what ted cruz is best. Those two things that he does, cupcakes and cock suck, and that's it should be this campaign. Get irish. Just fucking go for it. Go for it. Just I'm tired. Dude. Is enough time. It's still 2015. Okay. November of 2016 is the cupcakes and cocksucker ted cruz. Hillary's got the pants, suits you get the apron, get in, get in, and we're all taught. A year ago, caitlin was bruce and no one gives a fuck about it, right? Right. Right now he's caitlyn, right? And everybody cares. Everybody loves her, right? Right, right. Cupcakes and cock sucking for president ted cruz. Ted. Oh my god. That's what's up. He looks just he hollow black eyes. He's just a guy just trying to fucking stand down and make.

Speaker 1:          01:39:40       Just trying to pick himself up as bootstraps and make the american dream has just always weird. It's always weird when someone goes, they go that route. AntI same sex marriage going against the grain. It's like I'm in a still prosecute miracle. There's no place for gays. Look at that fucking quote. This is. There is no place for gays or atheists in my America. None. Our constitution makes that clear. He said that in fucking march 15 at liberty university that has no place for gays or ads. That's so silly. That's obviously a gay guy. I hate to quote myself, but there's two types of people that hate gay marriage or people that are really dumb or people that are secretly worried that dicks are delicious. I couldn't look at them. That is of a john.

Speaker 1:          01:40:32       Don't stick it in my mouth because I'll throw up. Go ahead and I'll show it. Don't put it in my. But this is the world we live in. abby martin. Is that the empire now? What does a guy like that fit in? Where does a guy like that fit in the empire is just like some guys scrambling, trying to get attention and run around the outside of the castle. What about me? I can be keen on that guys. So you have these. He's not really. He's just a side show, you know? I know some people just like rick perry Of the nigger had rent. What branch and what?

Speaker 1:          01:41:17       What is that ranch? What are you talking to? Rick perry's ranch. Shut the fuck up. His family. Our family has a ranch called end. John, please tell me your kenny. LIke refuse to take on the people and when he was running for president, people were like, are you gonna? Do like a rebranding effort about like the ranch that your family owns? And he was like, it's all like historical. Oh no, it's. I can't. You're, my mother knows that real. It's real. Come on. Find that. Oh my god, it's true. Oh my god. He's got a ranch called nigger head. Oh my god. Price yet? Yeah. Oh my god. Perry's version of the events difference in many respects. Elections of seven people. They painted the rock when they got the offensive word saw the offensive word and they painted it over. Oh, ever since. Anytime I ever saw the rock, it was painted over.

Speaker 1:          01:42:20       Oh my god. My mother and father went to the lease and painted the rock. Went to the least. What does that mean? Went to the release and painted the rock. Neither 1983 or 1985. Took them that long moves, not until the eighties, and we realized that it was a bad that have really had to start respecting the damn black people around Texas. ThAt's just what we call folks. Wait, and didn't he also keep a dead fetus in his fridge? Oh my god. Is that really the sign that you showed? No. That's fake, right? He kept a dead fetus in his fridge. For what? Just because she put them like, it's good. It's good. You don't want to waste those cells. You don't want to throw those in the trash truck or used to sell that to the black market. It would be if it was aborted fetuses that cured the gay q.

Speaker 1:          01:43:09       Imagine how ironic you needed an aborted fetus. Rick santorum's dead baby ritual. What is that? Fuck. I don't want to say that. Getting bummed out. Anyway, I got to end this thing in about five minutes. Oh shit. REally? Unfortunately. I got a crazy day. Oh no. Wait. Well, anything else going on? Uh, just everyone check out the grand staircase. What's going on with your art? You have beautiful art. When we were in town doing some art. Yeah, I did an art show called cosmos itself and I'm actually doing another one in two days. Everyone should check it out. If they live in the la area called ethos space, it's going to be in downtown la. Check it out. Don't tons of freaky spot now, isn't it? It's fucking awesome, man. We're the fashion district and some crazy warehouse. I don't say where you live. I'm moving in three days, so it's fine.

Speaker 1:          01:43:54       Now you've got another ghost out. There's a lot of freaky spots down there. YeAh, like you gotta. Make sure you don't go the wrong way there. Yeah. Yeah. Which is great. It's like, yeah, I'm sure that you've seen. You've traveled a lot of countries. I've seen a lot of horrible poverty. Went to hades, sob bad things, but then there's really nothing that compares to skid row because it's this crazy community living on the fucking street just taking over downtown la, like excess of huManity that's just spilled out mentally ill drug. I mean they're just like shooting up in the street, taking a shit. It's fucking nuts. Thousands of them. Thousands, and it's blocks and blocks and blocks. It's just lIke society is just like abandoned this portion of their people. It's very surreal and really scary and we live right by. There is an interesting thing, you know, someone wants to look at them and go, how do we capitalize on this market?

Speaker 1:          01:44:43       So many people's trust. how do we, how do we nail this homeless market? I'm glad cans still going. Strong body occupies just. I was just making it work because you're just right there. You're like, wow. Oh, like, oh damn. It's a fuckinG crazy scene. I remember the first time I was there, we were filling fear factory downtown and we were real close to it and someone brought it up and we drove by and how you gotta be fucking kidding. This is real. It's real. It's real. Super big and there's no one and like, what do you do? Most of them are just mentally ill and drug addicts, so it's like you don't. What can you do other than provide services like that. It's very just. And then one of the fucking tens. It's so bizarre. Has a giant american flag in it and you're like, I'm glad that you are still mirko all about America.

Speaker 1:          01:45:34       Little fucking skid row living america's fault that I'm out here. My phone, I'm the one to smoke the crack. Uncle sam didn't put the correct pipe in my mouth. I didn't work hard enough. Yeah. Well the american dream, there's a lot of mentally ill people during the reagan administration, they sort of changed the rules for what made you're mentally ill and what the distinctions were and that's when they sort of opened up the doors and let all these people on the street. I remember it like really, really clearly when I was a kid because there was a big debate like, oh, like wait a minute. You can't eat, and there's a lot of people that are like, you can't fucking do with those. You can't just change the classification. The classification for people that have mental illness, but they did and all throughout New York and boston.

Speaker 1:          01:46:13       That was like all these new mentally ill people wandering around the streets. it was like a real clear moments there. I just read the statistic that homelessness has gone up like 25 percent in the last four years, just in la if people homes on freeway overpass and jet and I remember like I told you the five percent swear to god and I remember I posted it and someone was like, dude, just move out. They can't afford la. Just move out. And I'm like, I can't afford them. Once you go homeless, you don't have any money. dude speaking really quickly before we wrap it up, I wanted to tell you I, we sHould talk about Cuba next time because I there and did a whole report on

Speaker 2:          01:46:50       it, but I'm zero homelessness. That was the most iconic thing about being in Cuba. No trash, no homelessness because everyone has their basiC needs, the shelter and there's rational system and stuff, but it was just interesting to see like the low crime rate when people have like basic shelter and healthcare, a lot of problems still very interesting because I. It was very different than every other latin american country. I was just like, holy shit. There's no homeless people. Beggars and. No, that's interesting. Yeah, it's not an ideal environment because you're forced into certain jobs and they kind of decide what you do on certain jobs, you know? Nope, that's bullshit. What about for athletes when they do that for athletes? So that's what my friend who's an economist actually when I came back from Cuba, she was like, so how is it like everyone's assigned a job?

Speaker 2:          01:47:37       And I was like, no, it's not like a brave new world where we're babies are born in incubators and trained to be like, you're a doctor, you're a florist, your this is not like that at all. And um, you know, there is a rational system and they do get paid very little. Um, but it's just interesting because people just have a completely different mindset. Like I remember I spoke to a bunch of doctors and I was like, why are you a doctor? You're not getting paid anything. Like why would I care about it? They're like, I'm helping my community and family. It's just like completely. It's just like a totally like a wall of understanding. I'm like, I'm coming from the hub of capitalism and I'm like, I don't understand the incentive. So it's really, it was really, really fascinating. But I'd recommend everyone check out.

Speaker 2:          01:48:14       Um, the Cuba series I did on breaking the set if you want to learn more and I'm checkout ethos space. Abby martin.org is my part that have lived there and Cuba really hated it. They hated the oppression. They hated the way they were treated. They escaped because they had more opportunity in America. You launched the athletes. There's three laws that America has put into place that coke's defectors. So one of them is basically trying to subvert cuba's whole medical internationalism. So Cuba has been forced into this like because of the blockade, the embargo, they've been forced into like total fucking self, like you know what I mean, like had like all organics and they have like, like maintain these old cars and they like don't let anything break down and kinda cool. And so they've also developed instead of invading countries and bombing the shit out of people, they've also developed an entire, like a medical thing for their income.

Speaker 2:          01:49:03       So they basically lease out doctors around the world, even when you go back to the Haiti earthquake, they were the first country that sent out the biggest contingent of doctors, a bola biggest contingent of. So they basically leased out like doctors to get oil from Venezuela to like get help. Um, it's interesting because people are like, oh, well they're, you know, they're like creating doctors to like just get oil and shit. It's like, well, there, they're doing what they can with the resources that they have. They're under a very crippling economic embargo. They have subversion programs going on through usa id every year. Despite the normalization process that's going on. The usa id is still spending $20,000,000 a year to subvert cuba's political process. So we've subverted the hip hop movement that we've created a fake hiv program. We've created a fake twitter called zoom zoom that's tried to like get people against castro.

Speaker 2:          01:49:50       But the most disturbing part is this medical internationalism where you have like 75,000 doctors working around the world on all these fronts. And the us has created a law that said you can defect to the us and become a doctor here and just leave your posts. So it's like, why are we trying to subvert like actual medical missions and humanitarian missions that cuba's doing? Really the only reason is because we want to subvert the socialist government that survived after the cold war that we still fucking can't accept. And there's also the wet foot dry foot policy that offers a cuban immigrants. No other immigrant in the world has this where you can just come here and just be an american citizen if you're keeping. Because no questions asked what foot drive still? Yep.

Speaker 1:          01:50:31       Wow. That must suck for mexicans. Like, what the fuck, man? I'm like, what is this bullshit like, why shut down. I did not know that. That's fascinating. It's really fascinating. You should have a conversation with joey diaz. He'd be fucking screaming, right? He went to Cuba, came over on a boat and you know, a lot of people, um,

Speaker 2:          01:50:54       look when you're a cuban and your, your, your honor ration system and you're living in this country that's kind of isolated and you're like watching american movies and you're like, why the fuck am I here? Can be there, you know, and you're seeing mountains of cocaine and the cases and you're like, why? But the problem is a lot of doctors defect and they come over here and then they're, they're caught for years and years and years they're, they're licensed, doesn't apply like they have to go through all day. Ended up being like a waitress in a restaurant for a decade, trying to become a practicing doctor. But when I was over there, not only they have free health care obviously for everyone in the country, but they also have an international medical school that trains doctors. Whoever wants to train all over the world can go and just be a doctor for free.

Speaker 2:          01:51:32       So I met like 20 americans who were there and I was like, why are you here getting your medical license? And they're like, because I don't want to fucking be $100,000 in debt in America, and they're like, I'm here to get my medical license so then I can go train and be a doctor. Wow. Free. So a lot of shit can be talked about how things are run, but it's a totally different society when you have basic needs met and when healthcare and like humans come first out of necessity because of the blockade because they had to create this. Not necessarily of altruism, but it's evolved in this such an insane. Just dichotomy of how society has functioned super interesting. What's going to be fascinating now the embargo has been lifted. It's going to be lifted. It's still not enough. So now look, travel restrictions.

Speaker 2:          01:52:19       Yeah. So now they've looked at travel restrictions and now raul has like opened up some private enterprise and stuff and that was a whole diplomatic process within the country to where they lifted some economic things. So now private businesses can flourish and so it's opening up because they've realized that they can't obviously have it like that forever. Especially now that the travels lifted, but it's gonna be really interesting to see what happens, especially now that the us still has this aversion tactics going on, these programs in place that encouraged people to defect and then also get. It's a perpetual

Speaker 1:          01:52:46       occupation of fucking Cuba that raul has said time and again, give us guantanamo bay. You leased it under false pretenses. We really want it back and the us as it's off the table. So that's the way the empire works back basis. So how has that. We liked least it 19. Oh three. We leased the guantanamo bay naval base was just a giant swath of land for housing, but it's connected to Cuba. It's on Cuba in Cuba. So we lease it. Then what's battista was an alum, our boy, but tessa was like a corporate fucking lord, you know. And so we had all these private enterprises in Cuba and, and the socialist revolution happened and then the lease agreement said this has to be agreed by both parties to continue or I'm sorry to dissolve. And then when the cuban revolution happened, Cuba was like, give us back guantanamo and the us was like, you know, we don't agree to that, so we're just gonna keep it.

Speaker 1:          01:53:40       And they never accepted a diamond, never cashed a dime for the rent lease after the 1956 or whatever the, um, the revenue. So yeah, it was, it was, that's really disturbing to me because I'm like, dude, just fucking go down to a bay. Like you can pretend that were normal with coupa, but it's never gonna be normal unless you give them some respect and if you're so scared of socialism and if you are so sure that socialism is a failure, then let them fucking fail on their own. Lift the block caden, let Cuba just function and let's see what happens. But right now, um, it's been so crippled in so many ways that it's impossible to really know what the country would be like without us interference. Well, it's very bizarre that we're allowed to trade with all sorts of different countries that are accused of all sorts of different heinous crimes against humanity.

Speaker 1:          01:54:23       But we can't with Cuba. I mean, just thinking about all the different countries that we're allowed to trade with. It's fun to go to the Congo right now, hang out with you, do whatever the fuck you want. You know, Saudi Arabia, we go back and forth with them all the time. Chicks just got the right to vote. You hear that like weeks, like it was on. It was in the news yesterday. Oh my god. If my twitter. Jimmy. Yeah, it was Saudi Arabia. Women in Saudi Arabia are going to get the right to vote now. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Look, it's 2015 I guess. Take off your burqas. Nope. Nope, no, I'll do that. We have at liberty than yet. No, well, I live in Iran. They were just fucking tons of makeup. They look hot as fuck and I just wear skin tight clothes because you're not allowed to show shit, but they were like yoga pants, like a total work around, but they have to have that thing on their head.

Speaker 1:          01:55:13       Woman are allowed to vote in Saudi Arabia for the first time in history. That's August 24th, 2015. Bam. 15th, 15 for the first time in the country's history, women's, Saudi Arabia. I've been given the right to vote and stand as political candidates in the upcoming elections. Wow. But it's just amazing, but just don't, don't drive. Don't your ankles have your. I guess the man needs to escort them to the voting booths because they still can't do anything without a male permission. Of course. It can't even drive. They can vote and they can't drive. You have the king, the former king. I'm sorry. Praise be with him. Fucking peace be upon him. He used to be upon abdula, but no, his daughters are like trapped in a dungeon. Like being starved. What? Yeah, they're like living in underground in some bunker that like they're trapped. They did an interview with someone and saying, help us. We're. We like disobeyed our father and we're being punished for. Yeah, it's super crazy. You look it up. Grand staircase to go to the grand staircase. Every time I talked to abby martin, she gets more depressing. Things to look up listening. Always. Awesome. Talk to me anytime you want. Anytime. Anytime my friend. All right, that's it for today. You fucks the shit out yet and we'll see you soon. Bye. Bye.
