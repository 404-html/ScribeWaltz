Speaker 1:          00:00          Hello Freak bitches,

Speaker 2:          00:03          that happens just slightly because a lot of people are in a cave in situation when it comes to their lives, they're literally buried under a series of antiquated, stale symbols that they're looking at the universe through and they feel trapped. It's like their shoes are too tight and if like a psychedelic or meditating too, and I really mean that. I'm not just saying that to say that because I'm. I really think meditation has a very similar effect, but any of these things, they reset those symbols. Structures in your brain and if you just like if you're in a cave in and you get an extra inch compared to like being pressed against the wall, that's a big fucking deal man. So it's slightly percentage difference. Change change is like, oh thank God I'm 13 percent less frightened than it was for my entire life.

Speaker 1:          00:54          Have you ever heard Tony Robbins talk about changing paths in life is you get really, really interesting analogy. He talks about like you're going to cars going the exactly saint or a boat or two boats going exactly the same direction, but one boat just takes a two degree turn, just two degrees here. As they go further down the one boat that took two degrees turn is going to go wider and wider away from the original path and that each decision that you make, that's a good decision. Takes you closer even though it's just like you're just steering your ship, just dirt as you go out. It's going to be a much different path, a much different end than if you just stayed on the original path. That's incredible. Different and psychedelics makes you go right. Turn Clyde. Yep. I mean at the the, the currents. Try to bring you back though.

Speaker 1:          01:44          Yes. Well ego tries to eat bread in the current. Kind of bring it back to where you were going, so it's like got to take them a good. Well, I've always said get off that current doing psychedelics. It's like pressing the reset button for your brain. Like control all the. Remember that, that your your desktop reboots and there's only one folder on the desktop and that's that desktop says the folder says my old bullshit and you have two choices. Either you just like create a completely different desktop, look at reality as a completely different or open up my old bullshit and fall back into these familiar patterns because they're very comforting, right? You know, in those moments after the psychedelic experience are so important to grab and hang onto because it gives you this opportunity to make this new way of thinking like a part of your habit.

Speaker 1:          02:27          Once you get in that habit, whether it's fucking, you know, 30 days or 60 days or 90 days, like people say that once you like have a pattern ingrained in how you behave and think and do it just takes a consistent approach to that pattern and then it becomes like an like a part of you like that's why people quit smoking. Like get past 90 days and you'll be all right. Right? Jews say when you have, if you go to sit in the same feed three times, he's just keep sitting there. That's your, that's your two old time seed. Wow, that's smart.

Speaker 2:          02:57          I'd make sense. It's like when you take a psychedelic, it's like if your life is a polluted city, like what are those? Polluted like Detroit, Detroit. Right. And it's like the psychedelic all of a sudden takes you in a helicopter outside the pollution and so now you're seeing, Oh God, the air up here so fresh. It's so nice down here. But the thing is helicopter going to land. It's going to put you back out into your city and that's where the job starts, which is like, Shit, man, how can I clean this fucking thing up? And then that's, that's like the. That's when you start doing things like exercising, meditating, or that's where you create just a very simple intention in everything you do, which is as much as possible. I'm going to try to alleviate the suffering of people around me as much as I can. You know, not. That might not be a lot, it might just be call, it might just be those.

Speaker 3:          03:48          So we got back from, from this last UFC, just a little bit of mushrooms was enough that I saw a homeless guy and he was looking for. I was like, I opened my wallet and I only have twenties, and I was like, no, fuck, fuck it.

Speaker 2:          03:58          There you go. That's what it does. And those little moments, man, it shows you that you get those moments present themselves to you all day, fucking long. But if you are stuck in selfishness, you don't see it. Yeah. It's real simple little things, but it's fun. It's a very wonderful. That kind of simple intention can really deep pollute your, your subjective city that you've been sucking in shitty gas. There was one title. I saw it

Speaker 3:          04:24          that I was the only time I was like, I've worked guide to somebody, but it was Willie Hunter was on him and he was shitting on following. He was shitting on some like comic who would become like a vine star, you know, so she was a shitty comment, but it became like a. and he was like, I hate fine. We're like, fine man. They're just for fun. There's six seconds from videos. He's like, no, I hate him. Like, what about a six second youtube video? Watch that, whatever. He was just big, shitty and really try to talk about it. He couldn't stop that. We started with the mushrooms and he was like, I'm a bad person. Fine. And he kept doing it and eventually I was like, listen, you're right. That was you being a bad person and I'm so sorry. But I was like, it's okay because here's the deal from now on, you don't have to be that anymore. You can just let that go and let people talk. And he's like, yeah, yeah, that's what it shows you, like you can change,

Speaker 2:          05:09          but that thing you're talking about where you realize, shit, I'm a bad person. That is um, there's, I can't remember the name and Buddhism. There's an actual name for that and it's considered to be a very sweet moment where you need that moment. It's virtualized or where you need that moment where you look at your life and you feel this very specific kind of sadness because you look at all the times you could have been kinder all the times. You could have called that person back all the times. He could have made decisions that were pushing your boat and the direction of a better world and you didn't do it and you should feel sad about that, but you shouldn't spend your whole life feeling sad about it. You should just spend some time there and look at it and think, okay, well that's gone. The past has been devoured by time. There's only this moment, and so from this point forward, as much as I can, my decisions are going to be based on reducing the suffering of my species, and that means like if your trash is when you have to let her keep going forever.
