Speaker 1:          00:00:00       Still out, figure it out later. Two, one. Oh, and with live, ladies and gentlemen, with the Creator, are you the creator of this library? Is Brian Brian? Yeah. Not Thinking yet. He has a god. I don't go that far. Right? Brain, the right brain. Cheers sir. Thank you sir. The clink, the famous Yeti Jingle. A rambler. Ooh, what a great invention. How'd you guys will? You guys were just getting hammered and throwing anything in there. Same way for folks who haven't been properly introduced. My friend Ben. Oh, is here and he's the one. He was in the podcast from paradise when we're in Lanai. Kind of my all time favorites. I mean the island or the podcast thing, but it was all awesome. The whole damn thing, but people are drinking those cat ladies now, which is. It's not to bad. That's terrible idea to dudley making that.

Speaker 1:          00:00:51       I was like, what the fuck are you doing? He Poured Tequila and red bull into a glass of red wine and we're looking at him like, what is. And people have. Hashtags are wrong, man. When people are hashtagging, of course I'd do it sometimes just to poke fun at everybody, but I've had probably a dozen people like, man, I tried the cat lady last night just drinking it, just to say they drank it in, which is just don't do it. People don't do it, but right brain is actually pretty good. I can get that. We were, there were some meat, some trigger, some bose involved and stuff just got put together. And I've had these before. They actually tastes good. But um, there's like no benefit that you get from our list. It's like all the science, we put it into Alpha brain, all the non science from whiskey out the window phones.

Speaker 1:          00:01:41       Totally. Well, I mean it's a, he's made zero leaps forward but we're good where we are currently. Maybe it my balance us out though. It keeps from getting too stupid, which that's a, that's a good achievement. Do big issue with whiskey. What does this whiskey we got here? This is, I don't know if Jamie just kinda like throw it out there. Gave us at the comedy store. It's called Angel's envy. Oh, that sounds like a think like angels are really envious of whiskey though. I mean, you're hanging out with God. You can fly. We want to buy it in a store with angel ended enough money. Maybe that sounded balances. It's got wings on the back. Maybe it's they're trying to market with red bull. I don't know. Those are always the wings on the back of a stripper that cries a lot and there were an angel and envy are both names, strippers that I've that I've never, never seen that.

Speaker 1:          00:02:32       It's a really good point. Yeah. The wings on the back is always a weird move. Right? But if you're listening, if you're drinking whiskey with, with an Alpha brand, you can do whatever you want. You can put whatever you want, whatever kind of whiskey you want in there. You're very open minded. Yeah. The Alpha brain cancels that out. It could be, give me the worst whiskey in the world and the Alpha brain makes it better. Have you taken this anywhere? This a right brain have not really counting on your listeners and deadlies fans to do that. I want it to be organic. It can spread brown the next time you go to some exotic location and they have a right, like if you're in Nepal. Oh, I'm going to a northwest. Territory's will here. Or your boys on your hat there. The eastmans oh you really like a week.

Speaker 1:          00:03:14       Oh Wow. I will. You do it up there. Caribou and dall sheep. Oh Wow. So we're doing a film about their Yeti film. Yeti presents to them about their family history and the northwest territories. Like technically what part of Alaska is that? So that's. It's east of Alaska, right? East of British Columbia. It's up towards the Arctic circle. So we'll fly into norman wells and go north from there, up into the Mckenzie mountains, which are about as far north as you can get before hit. The Arctic circle will be sniffing the arctic circle and most days. But it's still still Alaska, right? No, no, no. Its own territory. Real. Yep. Oh Wow. Same as Yukon. I mean, you know, you think Yukon Moose or whatever. They're all their own territories. That's. Oh, so he's Yukon is not Alaska. We'd have to look that up. I don't want to be right.

Speaker 1:          00:03:57       I'd have to look at a globe and I'm looking. I'm not questioning like I know. I mean I don't know either, but northwest territories is its own territory. It's not alive. So who owns that? Canada, I guess. Really? Yeah. Oh, so it's like past Alaska becomes Canada again. This is getting real deep. I should've known Kevin on this package here, like tell me the history of northwest territories. So here it is right now on a map. So you kind of. Territory is the Yukon is slightly east or east rather east and then the northwest territories course is further east above Alberta. So you're getting up there into, into the Arctic and it is connected to Canada. Yeah. But it's also connected to Alaska. It's no, it's to Yukon Party Canada. It's one of the provinces had it. Right. I'm getting confused myself. Yeah. I thought that the British Columbia section.

Speaker 1:          00:04:51       So I saw a British Columbia. I thought that was part of Alaska. You could read the wikipedia. It's always really. It's really different. Dramatic, wild mountainous and sparsely populated. It's crazy that it's north of northern Alberta, like people like, you know what, it's just not fucking cold enough here in the winter. We've got to keep going. Well they have lakes. They've got. I mean they have lakes for like a month. I don't know. I think when we're up there, we were talking about last week. I think when we're up there there'll be no, it'll be daylight 24 hours a day. Oh Wow. I believe now when you do that, do you bring like one of those eyeball cover things? Uh, yeah. We'll have to. Yeah, the mask, I have all covered things. Whatever you have to. You have to. Unless you really, unless you can get into 10 just Kinda zonked out.

Speaker 1:          00:05:32       But it's, it's 12, I think it's 12 or 13 days up there. So by the time you get to day five or six years, I mean you're living out of your backpack. You're carrying probably 50, 60, 70 pounds in your pack and climbing every day. So I mean it's probably the time you get laid down. I don't think it matters. Well, what's going on now when you do something like that? Um, how much gear you guys bring you living entirely out of your backpack. So when the float plane is what in the, in the plane takes you to base camp, which I think in this case is there's not a float plane. Well, so we'll be, it'll be a wheel plane. We'll we can take 50 pounds and then sounds each 50 pounds plus your body weight, plus you evaluate and then six days in they will either come in a helicopter and pick us up and move us if we're not having any luck or they'll just drop us more gear.

Speaker 1:          00:06:14       So you can. So the plan would be take 50 pounds of essential gear and then have other gear as backup back at base camp. Oh Wow. So you fly into base camp. It's like for me it will be like Austin to Denver, Denver to Edmonton, Edmonton to Norman Wells, hoppa charter to base camp. And then from there fly out into the hunting areas. How many days travel is that? It was like two days and change two days solid of just flying. Just flying was your overnighting because they. I mean they run like one added Norman Wells. They run like one flight a day or something. One or two flights a day. You have to be really dedicated to this kind of experience to travel. Just travel for two days. I once you do it, man, that's like the only way to go though. Really? It's once you. It's not the only way to go.

Speaker 1:          00:06:57       That's Douchey to say, but it's like the best. Most when you get back you're like, man, that sucked, but I wouldn't want to change it. You something happens to people when they do those like exotic location, like when they go sheep hunting and they risked their lives. Like I've seen some video of guys like, well I saw some video of you guys when you were in New Zealand. Yeah. When you were risking your lives with every step. Yeah. It's the whole time too. It's not just like, oh, we got up to this one area where the sheep live. You're just where we were in, in, in New Zealand with green tree. We when you get up into, so there's like beachwood far, so you're looking at like a 3000, 30 540,000 foot mountain, right? You're, we stayed in a little hut in the river valley and so when you're down there, you're looking up, you're like, oh, that's where the tar live.

Speaker 1:          00:07:43       Huh? Oh, 43,000 feet from where we are right now. For people that don't know is a crazy looking animal Himalayan. Yeah. It looks like a lord of the rings or something. It really does. Yeah. It looks like a wooly mammoth, but just a miniature version. Yeah, really crazy. We'll leave furry, shaggy a goat essentially like a goat slash sheet. But I mean the funny part about all that is, is when you heard those right there, look at the image they look like where we, where you would look across these little, these Alpine valleys and you'd see him look like a black bear looks like a giant black bear. And he just thinking, where am I and what is that thing? God. So I'm not like you have some really cool adventure or on this podcast. That's not me. When I see that thing, I think what the fuck am?

Speaker 1:          00:08:32       Where am I like it? It's wild looking. Yeah. And they live up in the Alpine. So there you've got the beech wood forest, which is probably, if I would just say hiking straight up for about an hour and a half or two hours. And is that an innovation species for New Zealand? They're feral, not feral. That's. I don't know. They're non native. So all the mammals on the island, they're non native. All of them were all were introduced by. And I wish I had really looked up someone specific, but they are all introduced by other countries. Europe sent animals over there, Teddy Roosevelt sent some animals over there like, hey, I hear you're going to want these. And so the problem over there to get on a whole different subject is that the people on that island, the residence of, of New Zealand don't value those animals as part of the landscape. They're just there.

Speaker 1:          00:09:17       I mean, Farrell would be a good term sheet of the way they view them to the value they have on them. We have like moose mule deer. That's, that's part of our ethos as a country. Right. And our ecosystems and our ecosystem, they've been here before. We were some level and so over there they just, they'll jump in the helicopter and mowed down like 40 red stag on a weekend because they want to control the population one because there's no winter kill and their predation, all that stuff. But they also just don't see a big red stag the way we see a big elk. They just don't, they don't have the value for it down there. Well, it's also the weird thing about having no predators is how do you handle that? Do you bring in predators? Like if they don't, they risk disease and there's all sorts of weird things that can happen like, like they have on Lanai.

Speaker 1:          00:10:00       Yes. Yeah. And so that's it. Right. And we've had, we've done that in this country with bringing down a northwest. What's the timber wolf that we brought him down and put them in the states and that's while that may seem like a good solution and we, when we were in British Columbia Hunt Moose together, we saw some calf skeletons. Yeah. We showed that picture on the podcast. It was kind of fucked up. That thing has just been decimated. Those wolves and I saw in Montana one time I saw them running circles. They run in like concentric circles. I just run like a bullseye pattern when they're hunting. I feel like the packs and I just watched. We were. I killed my elk on the first day of this hunt and I was watching and you would show there be a different wolf kill like every other day in this valley and it's like the wolves were just running in circles and I did see a couple of bulls fighting that in that trip.

Speaker 1:          00:10:50       Trying to call him in. Yeah, some of them. Yeah, two of them. Wow. That was like 1200 yards away and I had a rifle and I was thinking. I was thinking about it, but I mean once you see, when you see a dead fon everyday you go hunting and pre a new, maybe not new to that day, but knew that week you started to think like how if this pack work this valley for a full year, what could they do? And there's numbers to that. Somewhere at some people have figured out what, how many elk? A year upon the eldest son, Kale, before the wolves were reintroduced, there was an issue with overpopulation, so it. So that's where I think that's probably 100 come in, you know, you could, I, I value that animal. I'm willing to pay you for the opportunity to help you conserve that population. And so that's, that becomes very problematic for people.

Speaker 1:          00:11:36       Like when you start talking about wolves, dogs does wilderness or another one of those ones that black bears too. I mean, I think it's, you don't eat them. I mean even more than any tools way more than any that was talking to. There was a gal in my work that I was talking to and she lives in Austin, Texas and is very, not a hunter, but works at Yeti, and so she's around hunting and we were talking about wolves and I just said, look, I don't have a really hard and opinion on bulls. I've not spent enough time around them. I just know that their meat processors on four legs, they give no shits about anything. They don't. They're not just eating, they don't just eat what feels their belly. They eat and then they eat more and they kill more, and that's all they're wired to do.

Speaker 1:          00:12:20       Right. I've seen that in action, so that's all I really know. I don't know whether that's good for an ecosystem bad, whatever, and she just said, well, I didn't really know that it's hunting has really bad wolves will seem to have a good pr agent and hunting and management have a terrible pr agent, you know, so I think that, you know, that's, that's part of the problem, that there's a sect of people that are really glorifying a wolf for good reason. I mean, it's awesome animal that majestic animal, but at the same time there is a juxtaposition of that that needs to be told to. Well, I think a big part of the issue is that people know that they virtually wiped them out in North America at one point in time. And I think people feel guilty about that. Yeah. Well, and then they should feel guilty.

Speaker 1:          00:12:58       They should feel ashamed about the Mallard duck elk. People don't know the detail. Yeah. But we brought those back to the point where the numbers are higher than they've ever been before. But those same people don't know how that happened though. Right? Those same people aren't aware of how they just see white tails around. They're like, oh, that's annoying. People with the car. They don't know that it turn of the century. They were almost all gone. Yeah. Because we market hunting them to hell. Uh, and so I think that's, there's just, it's just education, man. I just think people need to seek the other side, which I always try to do and you do all the time, just seek whatever the other side is. And the hunting is not always the way to go yet, but it's inconvenient because like it's hard, like if, say if you're a vegetarian or a Vegan, you're going to get your information from animal rights activists and it's going to be biased in that direction.

Speaker 1:          00:13:45       Or if you're a hunter, you're going to get your information from hunting and conservation groups and it might be biased in the other way. And I think wolves are a good thing because they're awesome. You know, I don't know. I don't not like walls I think know hunter's like wipe the wolves that I've never heard that I've just started like what's the carrying capacity for this state but this region for wolves. Right? How many can there be? And, and I know in a lot of cases, you know, the biologists would say one thing like, okay, here's 100 bulbs in this area. And then when it ballooned up to a thousand, they argued for hunters come in and help put that population down. There were still a pushback, like, wait a minute, we said we agreed upon scientifically, biologically, you know, we, we know the problem is that it's negotiable at all.

Speaker 1:          00:14:28       It should have been like once the wolves hit 2000 starting, then you start a hunting season, but then the real issue is it's incredibly hard to shoot a wolf like this. It's not as simple as you ought and find a wolf and kill them. They're really smart and they think about Tara and New Zealand. You can't just like if they're over populated in there, you can't just like, oh, we'll just walk up the hill and crack a couple. I mean that's, that's a pretty big feat. So they jumped in a helicopter and that's gone down the tar that way to really, God damn. So how do they determine whether or not they should be getting them down? It's a no, and I don't know like the holistic method that I use, but I know our guide up there this year was just talking about he would go to the, to the sheep stations or the ranch owners or are some of the areas.

Speaker 1:          00:15:10       Some of those big mountain are own privately and some of the areas where they were down a little bit lower than they would just say go out today and kill a hundred and that's what they would do and it was, it was not, it didn't seem to me to be too scientific in the way they went about it, but it's a private land owner telling you, hey these, this is an infestation essentially, and my argument to them was like, why don't you just, these animals are here, they're not going anywhere, they're not going to swim over to Australia. Why don't you just treat them like we treat our, our wildlife whilst you just accept them. And then there was some people down there that were agreed with me whole heartedly. Some people in the guide and outfitting community just like, why don't you just accept these animals as part of your landscape and treat them like that.

Speaker 1:          00:15:54       And I think that's, that's a swelling opinion down there for sure. Well, how do they accept. I mean they just treat them like their pasts. I wouldn't say pass because they do have some value because hunters from around the world would go down there like we did, but don't have a lot of, um, a lot of that is on public lands or excuse me, private land in those high fence places. And that's, that's basically stag. You can't really. It's going to be, it's hard to high fence for shaming tar. They just live in places very. He'd been down to put up if he tried, you'd be dumb. But stag stag is a whole different deal down there. Yeah. I mean it's because they're so big, like they, the people want to go there and get a big day rack of antlers to their discredit, like they have harvested the bad parts of our hunting culture and marketed it brilliantly.

Speaker 1:          00:16:35       They have. Um, and I think there's a lot of people down there that would push back on that, um, on that idea. But yeah, explain that, what that means by the bad parts and not just the American hunting culture because there's a lot of Europeans that go there too. I think the parts of the trophy hunting, the hey come down here and, and, and work on this five inch tag. We've got it here and they have agents that go around and sell it for $500. We're talking about folks is the size of the antlers, not the size of the actual animal itself that people get super obsessed and they fetish numbers like you know the score and what a score is for people don't know. They take a tape measure and they go over very specific sections of the antlers and they calculate all the measurements together and when they do that they come up with some number and there's these milestone benchmark numbers like a 200 inch white tails, a huge deer or a 400 inch elk is a huge elk.

Speaker 1:          00:17:28       It is. They get stags and go to 500 and more, more and more insane. And is it as big as an elk looking animal body size? Not quite close but not quite. And and I and one of the sheep stations we hunted with originally, they farm. They essentially form red deer, red deer and stag. Same thing are walking around in, these are the same animal. No down there. Red Stag, red years. Basically the same thing, but you find red deer in Europe and they're different. Oh genius. Why do they call them a stack but isn't a stagnant of male stag, stag and, and high and being the female h I n D, yeah. And so, but you would call it a, you would call the animals are red deer. I've heard it called low 500 in Europe and they call it a red deer there. So I'm not sure those deer came from there anyway.

Speaker 1:          00:18:19       So I'm sure it's the same. So they came and they dropped them off in the 18 hundreds just to turn the whole place into a giant like hunting provision. Right. Some level at some level. I'd love to read the history of that. I don't really haven't gone that far back, but he said that before they came there was no mammals there. Yeah. Like what a weird patch of land. It's a weird like New Zealand is, is definitely coming from where we come from and all the things we have and we just find it normal that we can hunt how many, how many huntable species are there on this? Um, you know, on this continent going down there, it's just such a weird. But in the end they celebrate the outdoor culture. They celebrate hunting and fishing in the way that almost in the way that we do and they have public land much like we do and they're publicly and his is more revered and more well managed and better taken care of.

Speaker 1:          00:19:07       I think that our public lands and it's more usable and so they have all these like similar properties that we have in America, but at some level they're just, I think they just got poor luck. They don't have native mammals too. They don't have the Bald Eagle to put on their master. They, they just have these, you know, essentially shammy tar and tar aren't, they're not native either. No. None of those. None of them native. None of them. They also have Canadian geese that are not native. Right. Did you notice you used to have the biggest ego in the world? Really? Yeah. These, to have an eagle called the Haast Eagle and apparently they killed them off in the 14 hundreds and they were so big. There's speculation. They used to eat people. I'd kill them all. Foot 14 foot wingspan I think is what we figured out.

Speaker 1:          00:19:53       I'm not exaggerating if you've ever been over there. It's. It really is like if it's a place where that kind of eagle would live, that's what it looked like. Leash. That's what a hostile looks like. We're looking at an eagle that's literally the size of a big person and that's up the look at the size of that fucking thing and so this can be. That's Gandalf. I mean look, if it's as big as a person like that picture, go to that first picture again, like, yeah, look how big that thing is. I mean, if that thing spreads its wings, if you had been over there, the landscape over there and some of the Alpine areas that it looks like a place where that would live, that will kill you. That thing, if they caught you hiking, it would just pull you off the cliff and just drop you off. Oh, that's not a real hot steagall. The actual hostile with Google images. We're getting all kinds. We got Gandalf riding an eagle. We got. But that one, that one with the emus or whatever the fuck

Speaker 2:          00:20:48       those animals are. Is that a box that he's carried? That one's here. Oh yeah. So when did it go extinct, Jamie? What does it say? Look at the size of the dude standing next to what? The skeleton of a hostile. And he was that dude. That dude is awesome. I'm looking at him. Yeah, he looks like a wizard. Who's robes? That's an ancient intellectual and it really opened the door for 1,680. I don't know what it says. The real thing actually lived on earth and of course it was known as the tiger and the tiger skin. That's not that long ago. 1,600. Holy Shit. I thought it was 14 hundreds because there are six feet tall. Oh wait. Only 35 pounds and it had a wingspan of 10 feet. Wow, that's crazy. [inaudible], they're hollow bones. I guess. Thirty five pounds doesn't seem that much, man. How do you go back to that picture? How the fuck is that thing? Thirty five pounds. There's nothing. Six feet tall. 10 foot wingspan that things only 35 pounds. That seems wrong. Turkeys heavy. Like you pick up a Turkey and like 25 pound range. Look at the size of the thing.

Speaker 2:          00:21:57       He's all big. Every time I'm hanging around you. I hear. I hear about these evil mystical animals. Well, I think giant bear concern was that the Haast Eagle, they might have killed it off like the local New Zealand folks might've killed it off back then because they were eating people. I do not blame them and see if that's the truth. That might be a lie. Did didn't know about this hostile you like doing, you know I weighed 100 at a place called hostile when you're were over there. So maybe connection. Maybe we were really find and maybe find some ancient eagle skull. They go hook ball to see if at eight people relationship with human google that. See where it says relationship with humans. Yeah, do do, do, do, do, could have been possible to do even smaller Golden Eagles are capable of killing. Yeah. They said they kill humans, which scientists believe could have been possible. If the name relates to the Eagle, given the massive size of the strength of the bird. Even smaller Golden Eagles are capable of killing praise. [inaudible] biggest Sitka deer or bear cub? Yeah. That fucking thing killed a few people for sure. Like a baby. You didn't think. Yeah, like a baby.

Speaker 2:          00:23:07       You don't think that a Predator like that did not learn what it could and could not go get that. So the sculptures, goofy sculpture, the sculpture, is that the sculpture we were looking at? Maybe? Yeah, it was approximation of it. It says it's seven point five meters 25 feet tall. No, that wasn't 25 feet tall with a wingspan of 11 point five meters. Thirty eight feet. Oh, okay. That's that. That's the art park that we're looking at news. That's just a giant sculpture of animal. Okay, I get ya. But uh, there's a really cool eagle that lives in the rainforest called the heartbeat eagle. That eats monkeys. Want

Speaker 1:          00:23:46       to know about this stuff? Man? I find myself in a room in a rain forest a couple months. Be Looking for Harpy Eagles all over time. Well, there was a dude that was trying to put a camera in a heartbeat. Eagle Nest, and he got attacked by a heartbeat. Eagle. So it shouldn't have been doing that. Scientists should have worked in a movie theater or something. It was his thing, man. See if you can stop looking at these. Terrible. The way. Cool looking because it's kind of white. Look, we and we were talking about this when we were in Lanai. I have a problem swimming in the ocean because I'm feeling like I look like a seal all the time when I'm in there and I feel like sharks will. They're like, look at that. Like I just got this bolt. His legs bitten off yesterday in Florida.

Speaker 1:          00:24:29       See? Yeah. This is awareness man. CHOMP chomp shrunk. So now I'm scared of this guys, thanks to this. You know that the bull shark swim so far up river that they live in fresh water and they have been found as high as Illinois God, as they go up to fucking Illinois and they're the most aggressive sharks. I heard that. I've heard that before. At least to live right on the Illinois River. Will they also are the reason why the movie jaws wasn't inspired by a great white shark. It was inspired by a series of attacks by bull sharks and freshwater rivers in New Jersey. We talk about something else now. It's freaking me out and they made the music like, oh, it's terrible. Yeah. Johnson, your psyche, that stuff changed. What would the music be for one of those big eagles? Same. It would be death metal. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:25:21       He'd be out in the field, do death metal music. I've seen too much over in Nepal. They have these big things called longer guys. It's like if it's a Nepali Griffin, it looks like a big old vulture. You look at that thing up, see what the wingspan on those, but they'd be. We'd be up on some mountain glass if your sheep and there'd be like a giant thing with the airplane, eight, nine foot wingspan and you could see the creepiest part to me was you could see their heads move back and forth, like, look, they were, they were looking for shit and they, they take, they take and kill a baby sheep. I saw a video, but after I got back and I was going to freaking out about these things. I mean, it's a vulture. Yeah, it's like a Nepali. They call it a longer guyer.

Speaker 1:          00:26:03       And when we were there, they told us all you're gonna see Griffin's so it, it had a variety of names, like everything there seems to have. Um, but it's, uh, it looks like a vulture. It's like a giant. I didn't know that they hunted. That's interesting. I thought they just say, well, I watched something on like a planet Earth about them and that they showed them in packs and they were, they eat bone marrow. So they would, they would get a bone off the ground, fly up into the air and strategically drop it onto the ground. So it would crack open, fly down, eat the, eat the insides. Wow. Yeah. I haven't figured that out at the same thing. You could just see their brains churn and like a lot of times you see it an animal in the sky burdened sky. You sick. It's soaring around.

Speaker 1:          00:26:44       But you could see the predatory brain of this laundry guy as it flew above us, just churn. And as I looked around for what to get after. Well they say ravens are stupid. Smart. Like a smart as chimps. Yeah. So you think about this bird, the bird's brain, the size of what? I don't know. Limit, but yeah, it's. It literally found out I want to get inside that bone. I'm going to fly up and drop it. Some vision net insights. Well, somewhere along the line they figured a long time ago how to drop things off cliffs. Absolutely. They've been doing that with goats and stuff. There's a ton of videos of them grabbing goats and pulling them out like eels curricular. Whoa. That's the longer guy. What is that thing? That thing looks fucking evil, man. Holy Shit. Look at that face on that thing.

Speaker 1:          00:27:30       I think when I was over there when we were in in the mountains, I just wrote like a whole page about this longer yard. We saw. I don't remember it being taller. That's amazing. It's like one of the zoo. Oh my God. They were jet black. The ones we saw. Imagine how scary that looks, but just being jet black. Wow. The coloration. What does that. A bone above mouth and swallowing whole. Yep. Oh, primitive creature. Just like complete emotionless eyes. Yeah. That's. I, I vividly remember looking up at some point and seeing these things floating in the breeze and looking around and thinking that thing is savage. How big do they get? Jamie? What a weird name. Lumber guy or how do you spell it? L A, m, m e R G E I r over there. They described it originally our guy described as a griffin

Speaker 1:          00:28:26       but at Griffin's like a mythological. No, that's why I was thinking I'm going to see this mythological. I was waiting for something to land and talk to us. That's like, that's a place in New Zealand is like, that's, that's a perfect location. If they ever decided to do like some sort of a Jurassic Park taught actuation. Well even Lanai, right? Four feet tall. Nine foot wings hair. It is. Wow Man. Again. We'll get this weight. Fifteen pounds. That's crazy. I'd be nine foot. What was your goal for the Egyptian vulture? I'm going to have. I'm going to have dreams about this podcast. That's its closest relative. What the fuck? Isn't it crazy? That nature just designed a really creepy, shitty looking animal to come down and eat all the dead shit. Like that picture from right there.

Speaker 3:          00:29:17       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:29:18       It looks old as fuck when it looks like it could be in Nepal or Tibet. Over hunting has led to the endangerment of the species.

Speaker 3:          00:29:25       Hmm.

Speaker 1:          00:29:27       It's just um, it's weird how nature has evolved these animals or they have evolved to develop this, that weird look like vultures like look disgusting, but like, look at that things face. There's something about the way nature has evolved or they have evolved and they're not. Yeah. It's scary. Yeah. Cute animals are delicious. Bright. A rabbit? Yeah. Yeah. Delicious. Dear, dear. Delicious, delicious, gorgeous animals. Right? Like if you eat a bear, like some people think bear acute, but you got to cook the shit out of it. Yeah. Can we. Let's address something right now. Okay. Bear meat is is good. It's very good. It's very good. Yeah. It can be depending upon what they. Depending on what they eat, where you're at. Like if you're going in September to Prince of Wales, Alaska and you shoot one and it's just been eating salmon for a couple of weeks, clams on the beach.

Speaker 1:          00:30:20       You don't want to eat that thing. Right. If you go somewhere where we're good vegetation and it's, it's well, it's got a lot of fat on it. It can be good. I would argue it's not to be celebrated. Like it's not that good. It's, it is not as well. Depends. Apparently if you eat a blueberry bear is one of the best meats ever. Yeah. Never raves about for Nella does I? I've had, I've eaten a lot of bears and I like eating them. I'm not, I wouldn't throw them away or whatever, so I would continue to hunt them, but I've never had that same feeling of like an elp tenderloin or elk backstrap, like it's just not an x or an access, it's not in that category. So I feel like maybe we overcompensate a little bit because there's so much pushback on bear hunting.

Speaker 1:          00:31:01       Right. We started talking about how great it is, how great it is. It's really good, but it's not like it's not. It doesn't get that next level. Have you had smoked bear ham though? I have. That's pretty damn good. But that's one of those things where it's like it's smoked, it's Brian treated us and that's the biggest thing. Right. And you can most meats that you're going to go hunting for, you treat, you look at the cut of meat and you treat it accordingly. Right. And so there's no, you have to obviously cut the chicken gnosis you have to cook a bear all the way through to a certain temperature, so that may be b, because I love rare meat. That may be my problem. I don't know, but I think maybe I think maybe a little bit we could address the fact that hunters a little bit of over compensated for the fact that people are pushing back on them so much and that they're like, I love bear.

Speaker 1:          00:31:44       It's like it's good. Right? But I wouldn't choose it. My favorite. I wouldn't choose it over a lot of other meats. Right. If you have bad, but like if someone told me you have to pick one animal forever, I'd probably say elk and bear would be pretty far down the list. Wouldn't, it wouldn't make it in the top three or four? It would be all. Well that's again the thing that you just said like I like eating things medium rare or rare. That's where they taste the best. Yes. Yeah. And so like I'm not, I would never put somebody down for one. I love Barbie doll. You did all the time. That's great. I just, that's a point I've always thought in my head, I always thought in my head it's like people like large mouth, bass fishing, but if you go to a restaurant and they have large mouth bass right next to the Chilean sea bass and you pick the large mouth bass are kind of an outline to yourself. Yeah. Like, come on man. Yeah, it doesn't taste that good. It's okay. It's edible. It's edible. It's really good. I mean if you took a poll because large mouth bass tastes bear way better than large

Speaker 2:          00:32:40       mouth bass for gay. We're going down the track, like large mouth bass just doesn't taste that tastes better than large mouth bass. Large mouth. No. So. Okay, so delicious. Fresh water fish. Delicious. Go to Alaska and they're everywhere. Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          00:32:57       Um, but yeah, I'm to, I'm not much of a fish eater. Anyway.

Speaker 2:          00:33:00       John Barklow from Sitka was in Vegas this past weekend and we did. Yeah, he's a great guy. Him and Dave brinker were there and he was talking about how um, I love that guy to leave Michigan. Uh, but John was talking about how he actually enjoyed a brown bear meat and I was like, really? And he's like, he goes, it tasted like a mule deer roast. Like he goes, I made it, I gave it to people at parties and he said he put it on, like he cut it up into cubes and put little toothpicks in it and handed it out like as hors d'oeuvres at a party and people are eating and they're like, wow, this is delicious. What is it? And he goes, it's a brown bear. And people got mad at him. Of course they say it's a person. I love that he did it. I love that he did it though.

Speaker 2:          00:33:48       I support fully support that idea. Right. But I would assume that if someone like John who works for [inaudible] is probably the number one hunting gear, clothing company in the world. John is a wealth of knowledge all the way through and you know, had a considerable amount experience in the military. I would imagine the people that would come to his house for a party would be normalized to happened in La if you did. If you did that, God, they go crazy. Yeah, there'd be a, there'd be riots. Yeah. You should see the look on people's faces when my kids tell them that they've eaten bear because you know, when the kids were like five and six, like I've eaten. I ate a. It was awesome. Do they have that like fierce look in their eyes like you just had to bear. I think it's fun to freak people out. I do like that sausage and Doris Acute. That's a wonderful thing coming out of there. It's weird, right? It's, you know, the bear thing is a very strange one. And I um, I definitely don't like hunting them. Like I like hunting. Anything else

Speaker 4:          00:34:47       I struggle with that. Like I as a hunter, I feel like coming on and talking as a hunter, I don't want to like disparate disparage anything, but I also just want to be 100 percent honest about every part of it. And hunting is really complex activity and I feel conflicted about it almost every time I go. Like not about killing the enemy, we're hunting, but just about little parts of what's going on. Yeah, and so bear hunting, so sometimes you just want to like Rinella said this once, and I never understood it until it happened to me. He's like, I just want to watch them. Sometimes I don't really want to hunt them and it's. It's what is hunting anyway. It's hunting, killing or was hunting, getting close enough to like shake their hand saying, yeah, it's the whole thing. I think my opinion on that specific point is one I would go back to.

Speaker 4:          00:35:29       I always ask myself two questions, why are you going and and does this hunting benefit the place and the animal that you're hunting and if I can't answer those questions myself and I always strip away conservation and meat from the first question, will you have a very good way of looking at this? I think is very honest. I think this is super important is that conservation is essentially a side effect of hunting. That's a byproduct and to pretend that it's the whole thing, it's almost like a weird. It's, it's a disingenuous approach to the argument, like really saying you shouldn't be hunting will say, well, hunting is conservation and hunters of the best conservationists. Okay, that's funny. That's true. But it's not as true, but it's not really why you're doing there. And there's the, here's the biggest point to make there semantic chinks in that armor, right?

Speaker 4:          00:36:15       We've built up over the years as hunters. They usually organic meat and conservation as this like armor, right? That insulates why we go. And I think there's just chinks in that armor that if we don't recognize those points, especially the conservation, when I think that's a bigger deal, like conservation hunting is a tool for conservation. It's the same way as translocation is a tool conservationist. Um, you can move the animal to get them away from a certain situation, uh, reintroduce animal fats one way or bring in hunters and help manage the population that way. But it's that first question, right, is why do I go? And I always say it's like we've had experiences, you and I together in the woods that I wouldn't, we couldn't replicate anywhere else. Like you've done a lot of cool shit and there's some like when you ran down the road after I shot my moods, like there's just something about that for me that is way more fulfilling and enriching to my life than any other thing I've experienced.

Speaker 4:          00:37:13       I haven't experienced everything, but all the things that I've done well, it's so primal. Right? And so it's that. It's learning about animals. You're in the woods too. You're also in a really almost like you're a visitor in an alien world. Exactly. And so you learn about these animals, you, you developed skills, I feel like you wouldn't develop any other way. So and on and on it goes. I mean there's probably a 100 reasons that I and I discover a new one every time I go. And so I always say like that's the answer to the first question, why do I go? It's not like, man, I'm real hungry and I want to control the population. I'm aware as I go hunting that the two, those two things are byproducts of my efforts, then they're always going to be byproducts of my efforts unless I'm poaching.

Speaker 4:          00:37:53       Right. You know, I'm, I'm, there is a biologist, a state wildlife biologist, federal biologists that determine what tags go where, what animals, they're moving pieces of the puzzle around to keep this thing the way it is. Right. Keep it healthy, keep it stable, but they're also looking at what's the economic impact of that all that's going on while I'm out there thinking I gotta kill this big buck, but I'm not thinking while I'm out there with my bow, I'm not thinking, well, I'd like to kill that one because that'll really stabilize this area, but I'm out there and kill that one because I really liked backstraps. I know those two things are happening, but they're almost like be pulled that away from, from what's actually going on and focus on why you're there. Like, why don't you go, why did you go to Lanai?

Speaker 5:          00:38:36       Like what somebody said, why did you go, what would you say? Two reasons. One, um, to bowhunt for me for sure because I want her to eat access to here and two, because I think that it's great practice. One of the hardest things about bow hunting is just you can practice all day on a target, but it's almost like never sparring. Like you could practice all day hitting a heavy bag, but you've never had hit a person. Right? Like once you're in front of a person, things get weird, but when there's a chink in the armor, right? So you say, I practice on an animal, that's terrible. I would say to that, like that that's just another chink in the armor that we all know is happening. Like if we were conservation, so we would never pick up a bill. Yeah. But I'm not practicing on an animal.

Speaker 5:          00:39:19       Look, I've never practiced before. Texting maybe be in the wrong term. Like there's something in there that like the experience of stalking an animal is pretty visceral and if you've never done it, you shoot your back on the hell you want. Well, I say practice in terms of like when you compete as a a young martial artists, it's not really practice, but it is like you're involved in competition, so like are you hunting or are you practicing? We are definitely hunting, but that hunting is practice for other hunts or you don't get nearly as many opportunities as you do in Lanai. Lanai is one of the best examples of a place that has no predators in a real problem with overpopulation. You were with me in Dudley that one time where me and him and his son were were hanging out and we were there at last light and we were watching these access deer come off the mountain and we saw how many hundreds.

Speaker 5:          00:40:11       I mean it might've been seven, 800 deer coming off this mountain and we were like, what the fuck? It was just crazy. There's 10 more, there's five more, there's six more, there's 11 more. There's a herd of 20. Like what the fuck? It got to the point where like this is crazy. So in a place like that, I feel like you have a, a great ethical argument for like they're going to shoot these animals, period. And the only other way to get around it is you bring in wolves and if you bring in wolves, wolves, and these people also have dogs running around on the streets and like pet dogs, those dogs that get fucked. Like immediately they're going to get killed by wolves. Wolves want to take out all the possible. You can't have wolves on the NIH. It's a stupid idea. Let's, hey, everybody is stopped.

Speaker 5:          00:40:55       We're never going to do that. But. So it's one of it in terms of like since since the animals are there and there's no talk of eradicating them because they have a real value. The people that live there live off of them, like all those folks that we were hanging out with, like Romano, a lot of the people that work at that place, they eat access all the time and it is without a doubt, not an oh, it is the opposite of it is the most delicious game me in the world. If it's not, if it's not, if it's not number one, it's number two. It's amazing. It's so good. Like we hated it at the restaurant. They served at a restaurant and remember the burger

Speaker 1:          00:41:34       we had that one lunch. Oh my gosh. And then the state police, the state place at that place. Terrible. Terrible meaning? Good. Terribly terrible. Like, Hey, I can't get it out of my mind thinking, oh yeah, that's what it was. They were sliders. Yeah. But that's the restaurant serves tenderloin and it is phenomenal. It's so good. So why would I. that's why one thing I always try to separate and I try to do it only because I think I try to look at it from someone else who is a non hunter and is hearing us talk or hearing me talk and whatever. And maybe thinking like that's a weird part of that. Like, that's strange. And so I feel like if I can say yes, the meat is delicious. Yes. They got to kill these things. Yes. The local people value the animal because hunters exist, you know, they, they wouldn't just gun them down because hunters will pay to go out there.

Speaker 1:          00:42:24       All those things. I think set aside, what am I there for? Like we were that group of hunters we had in camp was probably. I mean I've hunted with a lot of awesome talented folks, was probably the most skilled group of hunters I've ever been around when thinking about who we have. We have John Dudley is arguably, if not the best bowhunter in the world. He's in the top three. I think it's like, it's like John. Well there's like top four, like John Kamm, Remy and uh, Adam. Adam Green Tree. Yeah. They might be all the people that funded with that top four, I would say. I think they might be the top four in the world and if they're not top four, they're all during the top 10 cs. If you think you're better, come see us. A clan of killers. I mean, and then you've got Shane Dorian is a great bowl, hundred two and it's a big wave surfer in the world.

Speaker 1:          00:43:10       Say about Shane. He's fanatical, like he would just, I'd be like, Hey Shane, you want to let go take a break and get a sandwich? And he'd looked at me like, what? Yeah. He's like, no, we can be hunting. Why would we be eating sandwiches? He was out there all day, every day, all day. Then he didn't come in during lunchtime when everybody else was in [inaudible]. It was 95 degrees outside. Yeah, he's out there on his hands and knees, crawling bushes. It's crawling, hoping to find one slip and this girl just forever to crawl it for me. Like one reason to do that, stripping away all the things that I know to be right. Right in my own mind was that was those people getting them all together? Yeah, and then like meat and Roman and me and Brandon and meet Alec. All our guides and all the locals that were there, like there's things I and I learned more about the quick twitch muscle and the gut, dear.

Speaker 1:          00:43:58       Oh my God. Than I've ever learned. So I feel like I've learned something. I spent time with these people that made me better at not just hunting, but everything. Well for people who've never been around and access to hear before they evolved with tigers. Tigers hunt them. I mean, you have never seen an animal more fast in your life. How about the one deer that we shot? I shot this deer. It was 60 yards away. It was looking at me and I was like, I think I'm going to shoot it. It's just standing there. By the time I got there, it was four or five deer away. It was swimming to Maui. It was at a little. It build a boat and it was over 60

Speaker 2:          00:44:32       yards away. The arrows going 275 feet a second and it was nowhere near it. By the time it got there. It's like, please, there's so fast. They're fascinating. Any animal I've ever seen. Well, would that lets you say like what a weird scenario to be hunting an animal that has been trained by tigers to avoid. You know, what a weird thing. So like that. That's my appreciation. That little, that little exchange of, hey, me and tigers both hunted this thing, like that's, that's something cool to me, that's a, that's outside of this thing. So talking about that all day with it and then the meat. Look if you're gonna, if you're a person who values animal protein, if you like ethically sourced animal protein, there's no better way to get it than, than like a place like Lanai, like all the pieces are in check. Do they need to kill them?

Speaker 2:          00:45:18       Yes. Is there an overpopulation problem? Yes. Provide jobs for local. Yes. Yes. Yeah. All the good things. I mean there's a lot of positive sides to it. Yeah. And again, if you're someone who enjoys bowhunting, like, look, it's an uncomfortable thing for some people, but I enjoy it. I like it. I like getting my meat that way. I don't like, I feel bad if I get bacon from a store. I feel like. Are we talking about like a as predators, like we are predators. If you look at, you know, it's been millions of years. We've been killing eating things. New humans are herbivores and that's all a lie. I don't know, I've done some reading and Predator.

Speaker 5:          00:45:51       Look, you don't have to be a predator. You could live off of, but aren't we though we up. Some people. Look, you can live by point is if you want it to. I don't want to disparage away anybody lives there live. You could live off of just pure vegetables. You could live off it and by the way, there's a real moral and ethical argument if you are a Vegan to eat mollusks folks because monologues are more primitive than most plants. They don't communicate as much as plants do. They don't have any sense of feeling. They have no nerve endings that would allow them to feel pain. They're incredibly simple organisms. The only thing that we have against them in terms of like when we think about them as being an animal versus a, you know, a plant. People think eating a plant is cruelty free. Eating a mollusk you're killing a living creature. Right? But that's just because they move. But a fucking Venus flytrap moves to and it's probably 10 times smarter than like a scallop. Like they're not smart. It's hard to regulate that morality. It's. It is, but I mean I just want people, if you're, if you're uncomfortable with eating chicken, I get it, but clams and oysters and those things are good for you. They really are and it's sustainable and the, the, the animals themselves are not feeling shit.

Speaker 2:          00:47:05       Yeah. The moral entanglements of all of it is just like we say, we're, we humans. We wake up in the morning and you consume everything like you just consuming. You breathe there. You pump out CEO too. I mean every other animal does too. They just wander around on the grass and consumption engines. They're like for us to to separate out one part of our consumption and then beat the crap out of it. Even though we've been doing it for 2 million years is in and of itself kind of weird. Well, you know what I think happened. Is your mic on? That was a weird story. Loud was weird. It was like it was in my ear, Davies, Davies on the ride there. They're getting crazy, but I think part of the issue is that people over the last hundred years or so have been so removed from where the meat comes from that when they can find a direct connection like, oh, you went and you shot a moose and then you ate that move.

Speaker 2:          00:47:58       So like you were, you killed the Moose. Like you didn't have to kill that Moose like that. That becomes problematic because people aren't used to someone killing things. Yeah. People that they know in particular know and I, I enjoy the ideological conversation. I just enjoy the conversation. Right? Like I enjoy it because I think it's part of a human condition. It's part of who we are and what we do. So yeah, we should probably fight about it a little bit and disagree because it's pretty damn important. Like this is an important piece of our humanity. It is. We're talking about. So I, I feel very strongly that hunting is like the essence of who I am as a human and has made my life better. But I can see how somebody else would say that's you're killing stuff I can't do. And I also think that those people are important.

Speaker 2:          00:48:37       I think so. I think having vegans and having animal rights activists and having to be able to have dialogue with them, it also makes sure that you keep people honest, like people that are hunters like, you know, like, because we all know unethical people. There's people that are unethical. Absolutely. Look at it. I always think about it, you know, if you look at the trend of hunting and the seventies hunting was doing great. And then in the eighties started to tick down fucking Bambi. That's what happened. You. Well I would say three. We, I, we talked about this before, like three things. Bambi, maybe Walt Disney. He was maybe a Dick, I don't know. Uh, and then urbanization, right? Which correlated with the client and hunting. And then hunters being the third one. Messaging we have a bad were bad pr. Some of them are bad pr agents and people like Rinella that are amazing at it.

Speaker 2:          00:49:27       We're way better now than we were five years ago with better tomorrow than we were yesterday. But I think like in general, like if you look at that line graph right in the seventies, it was going nicely in the eighties. It started to decline and I think 2011 was the first time. It actually went up. A real number of. I think it's the licensed sales or number of hunters participating. I wonder what caused the. That's like the organic food. There was a study that said locavores, they're talking about more women. They talked about returning military members. I'm around remembering reading the study. I think those are the top three. But I think local Var was probably pushed out there as like the way to reverse that second point. The way to reverse the suburban and urban rise was to take that suburban a male or female and say you can get your food right. And then that's a way to kind of reverse the decline. And I think that's probably what was happening that well everybody wants to go with locally sourced, locally raised grass fed. People are trying to go to farmers markets and connect with the people that are actually growing the animals. And this is like one step better than

Speaker 5:          00:50:28       that, instead of having an animal that's in captivity, go out into the forest. But there's a rude awakening for a lot of these people that think they're going to just go ahead and try it. Like it is not easy by any stretch of the imagination.

Speaker 4:          00:50:39       The other problem, it's the Grand Canyon being I would love to. I would love to procure my own elk meat and killing an elk is like being on two sides of the Grand Canyon. Like you can't. There's no bridge to be built there. You got to take it one step at a time. And for most people that's just not the time for that. They don't have the want to do that. So I would say it was there like 14 million hunters in the world or something like that. Or in the. In our country. How many, how many? Non Hundreds. You don't either have the wherewithal to be, to get educated or want to or just don't fall into the anti on her side, like the agnostic crowd. How many of those are there out there? I don't know, but it's hundreds of millions of people are, you know, there's a lot of them.

Speaker 5:          00:51:20       Urbanization. One of the things it's done just just careers, careers in cities. It's eliminated almost all of your free time and if you wanted to go out and procure your own meat, first of all, if you want to do with a rifle, that's going to take a tremendous amount of time, but if you want to do it with a bow, so multiply that by a factor of like maybe five or 10, maybe 10, 10 is probably pretty honest,

Speaker 4:          00:51:43       honestly. And then you're talking about one of the hardest pieces is access, right? So even if you. If you get with John Dudley and you learn how to be a great archer and you understand that in your suburban area, there are some places where there's deer that you may kill. You got to get access to those places and then when you're done with that, you've got to figure out a way to get that thing from dead deer to meet and all the other things. So this is just so complex. How would you ever expect somebody just to be, have like a desire? You were like that at some point.

Speaker 5:          00:52:11       Well, Rinella opened the door for me to have that super lucky forever grateful because when he took me into a wild back country, Montana. Yeah, you got gear in the nuts. The first year there was a breaks in the Missouri breaks in October nine degrees out. Freezing your dick off every night in a tent, but it like lifeless, Steven Ella. That's kind of what it's like and that it. He loves suffering. He loves it, but I love that he loves it. He's legit as they come.

Speaker 4:          00:52:39       He really is. I think that's it, right? There is just this, there's this big gap and my father got me into it but my brother doesn't. Doesn't hunt and. But I think he has a respect for it and understands what's going on. But he just, I think at the time that I was introduced to hunting, my brother was more interested in going out with his friends and Saturday mornings were not for getting up early and so we're essentially the same person, but I just went this way and he didn't go that way. Right. So it's, it's a weird. So you could be in the same house with somebody in a different way.

Speaker 5:          00:53:10       Well, Rinella has a real good way of looking at it too. He's like, uh, I don't expect people to go out and get rid of their own sewage. Why should I expect them to go out and hunt their own food like you don't have to?

Speaker 4:          00:53:20       Well, and he's, I think he probably said this at some point, um, or somebody smart did. It was like I choose, I believe, that I choosed to meet to be the one thing that I grabbed ahold of to bring into my, to my skill set. I don't knit my own clothes. I don't, I don't make my own shoes. I don't build my own houses. You know, we were just looking at some construction stuff a little bit earlier. I'm like, dude, I what? Yeah. What are they doing? What are they doing? Yeah, I couldn't do that. I just picked this one thing because it's also part of my passion. So you couldn't just ask someone who's a construction worker to go like, go hunt, get some mate. I know you have a desire for that. So that's just another hard part about hunting and nonhunters by proxy are essential to hunting always in industry and opinion and because we could legislate ourselves out of being able to hunt that can happen is a privileged man. That's not a right and a lot of ways and so that's another whole nother can of worms, but it could. It could go away.

Speaker 5:          00:54:21       Yeah. I think the. The issue is that so many people are opposed to it because they're so removed from the realities of the wild and they just feel some sort of moral superiority by either not eating meat entirely or by not killing their own meat. The not killing their own meat is really ridiculous. Like my wife was having a conversation with someone, they were out to dinner with a bunch of people while I was on an elk hunt in the guy was eating a steak guy from England in England and all hunt or they've do hunting foxes and horses and shit. And they were like, tweed pussies England. We love you guys carving a steak. And my wife goes, oh, he's actually out elk hunting. And the guy goes, he hunts. That's deplorable. The guy said, does deplorable while he's carving a steak. I was saying something the other day

Speaker 4:          00:55:07       and I got. And I got a lot of, like people were looking at me like I was weird at work. Uh, one of my buddies that work was eating a chicken sandwich from chick filet and I look in the bag and there's a cartoon chicken on the bag. And in my mind I'm like, well, that's like building a swimming pool by the lake. That's fucking weird irony that that were like saying, Hey, I'm eating the chicken, but here's a cartoon version of it so we can celebrate the fact that we just murdered this chicken and we fried it up like that doesn't make sense like a swimming pool with a lake as smart because it's Paris, the braids wearing all the time for a refill and it is weird. That was. You know what I mean?

Speaker 5:          00:55:44       Well, we. We definitely like to cartoon eyes. These weird.

Speaker 4:          00:55:49       Is that a word? Not really cartoon. Personalize. No.

Speaker 5:          00:55:53       Well, anthropomorphize. As you take an animal and you give it human characteristics personify. No cartoon of vacation. Is that a word? Just turning it into a fucking cartoon. Green drinks. We'll do what we want. A sweet little cutie pie when really a chicken is a ruthless little fucking dinosaur that lays eggs for you everyday,

Speaker 4:          00:56:10       but it isn't. Is it weird to be eating a chicken and like there is where that chicken came from. Yeah. It's like a picture of the chicken. So it kind of a. seems like a weird way to handle it. Well, it is weird, but we liked

Speaker 1:          00:56:24       cartoons. People love cartoons. Well that's like the personification of animals I think is part of the bear situation because my kid, my son is nine months old and from before he was born until now there's cartoon bears everywhere and there's like this, you know, personification of these cute little creatures that come along with being a little baby and then. And then you look at so many a pixar and dreamworks films at like personify animals. I think that's, I mean it's, there's some indoctrination into that, right? There has to be.

Speaker 2:          00:56:56       There is because in those, those magazines or rather those movies and books, even those animals will never like eating each other to. I mean if, if like, if, if he killed a hiker, you know, if a hike or fucked up on one of the episodes of yellowstone and just took a wrong turn and Yogis, like eating his rib was bunch of people show up and bear and yoga. You're just going at it and ripping it apart. Eating cubs. Yeah. Eating some dude asshole first boys screaming and swatting at it with his fucking hiking in their plant, in the circle of life. In the background. Yeah. Well Go.

Speaker 1:          00:57:39       Yeah. There's this. I feel like there's some indoctrination and maybe maybe that's what happens. I just don't know. I have no idea why bears get this thing because bears are around. It's not like there aren't barriers around there in almost all states aren't they? Like,

Speaker 2:          00:57:53       yeah. But it's what it is is people that don't experience them firsthand and when they do experience a firsthand, usually they're in their car like local bear and they drive by Tommy

Speaker 1:          00:58:03       that one bear that was walking on a tight legs. And that was cute.

Speaker 2:          00:58:06       Oh, that one that had a broken front paws with friends with that bear. They called them like pedals or something like that is awesome. There was um, my friend Tommy who lives in Connecticut sent me a picture of these bears that were in the middle of the street duking it out in Connecticut. Like they're invading Connecticut now and they don't have any pressure. So here's the thing about bear hunting as opposed to anything else, like California is weird in that they don't hunt mountain lions. But what's good about that is California has very little deer now. It's not good if you like to hunt deer, but it is good if you like to drive down the street and not slamming a fucking deer. Like Iowa doesn't have mountain lions, but they do have a shit ton of deer. And when you drive late at night in Iowa, you got to have your foot on the gas. We're ready to hit that fucking break at any second. Just get that ranch hand guard garden. He's mad. Max Grill people like everywhere you look. And like Iowa and Montana, these people have pickup trucks with these battering ram front grill. Things that they should I

Speaker 1:          00:59:11       deer. We kill on alumni. Were you in any of the deer? Oh, we must've hit a car. Oh yeah, with the Brandon's truck. I think we hit at least two or three deer. Did you? While we run the night, we, we were there. Any romanza better driver than Brian must be this. What's going on? And if you're listening, we never handled tenant to. We didn't even hit one. Yeah, we hit multiple, but they were telling me about them. They were like, people just slamming, you know, I'm sure the insurance industry would really enjoy will in Cape Town last year a guy died because a guy in front of him hit a deer and the deer flew through the air and went through his windshield and brain. Dumb luck. That's a shit luck. Having a longer term story like that you like, I would have liked to hear that.

Speaker 1:          00:59:56       You're like, I would have done duck as a pussy. I'd have been like, I don't know, stupid shit like that. Right. I would have been driving my car and I would have seen this deer flying through there. And I'm like, well, it was a good run. Like there's, there's nothing I can do about it. It's been a good time and airborne dear. That's just bad luck. The 150 pound blacktail yeah. Through the air. What the hell? Antlers and hooves I'd have been like, well it was. I lived all these years without this happening. That was lucky. That's probably more lucky, right? Yeah. Yeah, but that's, I mean, you know, you start to like break down those things like more animals, less animals, the value of them and all these things. What a complex freaking thing to have to figure out. I always just get more.

Speaker 1:          01:00:44       You read, the more you jump in, the more you go, you know, going to New Zealand, go into, in the northwest territories, going in Nepal, you go to these places and you just realize that everybody has the same essential problem. Like how do we cohabitate, how do we live with these things that, that we were in some ways meant to consume. Like there's evidence of 2 million years ago in Tanzania, a human's early humans hunting and so 100,000 generations of people have a sense have lived on the hunter gatherer diet. You know? Then you had the industrial revolution, couple generations of people kind of were introduced to a new diet and then the last couple of generations you have processed foods and so you. Everywhere that I've ever been, you find people are struggling with that thing. It's like it's just not us in America, right, but when you can exist on a plant based diet, I mean, I know a lot of people literally absolutely can be done and I'm sure in those 100,000 generations there was plenty of people that didn't exist on the hunter gatherer diet alone, but the majority of money there were honestly because I feel like people were just really super optimal opportunistic back then.

Speaker 1:          01:01:56       I mean if you were just trying to survive and struggle, I don't think you would say like, Hey, I don't want to eat that rabbit. Rabbit is the way I live, and then you have to only where it's spelled and the left. That's a different deal. I was writing a piece one time and then I got into reading about these. A basket weaver, people that were in the valley of fire state park in Nevada, which is really close to Vegas

Speaker 4:          01:02:20       and you should go if you've never been up there. Basket weavers. Yeah. Basket basket maker or a basket weaver people and they're like native Americans. Yeah. They were essentially a roving band of nomadic hunters. I don't. I can't think of the year, you probably look it up and find it, but there was different generations of this essentially roving band of tribes in that area. Next time you're in Vegas, it's like an hour drive north. There's a bunch of petroglyphs that depict like dvds and and sheep and all these different things there

Speaker 5:          01:02:49       and you can just go visit them. What's fucked up about those petroglyphs? Man, they're not protected like there's a ranch in Texas that a buddy of mine went to and he's like, you could just go over there and touch these things and they might be 5,000 years old.

Speaker 4:          01:03:02       I did that when my wife and I went up there. You could have add a can of spray paint. They weren't like, how fucked up is that? It's strange. It's strange that you wouldn't find a way, but also probably. Yeah, it's probably okay because it's a natural occurring. You know, this is a natural place. You want to put fences up or no guard standing there. So what solutions?

Speaker 5:          01:03:19       Pretty bad ass that no one's

Speaker 4:          01:03:20       so far. Well, and so you'd go up there and you see these things and you're like, holy crap. So I started reading a little bit about those people and they were a part of a nomadic, a band of hunters, gatherers that lived in caves and essentially followed a desert bighorn sheep, much like a end user. The planes followup buffalo. All right? So they were, they essentially follow these things into this valley. Eventually the Anasazi Anasazi Indians move in, they start cultivating the land and planting crops and you get this like, oh my Gosh, agriculture and hunting, which one is better? What do we do? And so the whole story of that interaction, uh, is interesting to me because it's kind of the evolution of our culture, right? Hunting is created this social structure wise for us to communicate. It's created all these things, ways for our body to grow and expand as we were, you know, early humans, a waste for our brain to expand and grow and function differently.

Speaker 4:          01:04:14       And then you have this like, oh, it's a lot easier to plant crops in the ground than it is to go kill a sheep. Right. Guys, anybody is this easier, so then you get into this weird thing like what do we do now? You know, and so I think their, their story was very much like the Anasazi Indians, they go in and they cultivate this area and as long as they can grow crops, that's what they did, you know? And so this nomadic band of hunters kind of settled in this area and so I'm sure they still wanted to get me because they have to because you can't grow a whole year's worth of food for, for a value like that. But I think agriculture kind of won out a little bit in that, in that scenario and as it would, it's easier way to live. Yeah, it's an evolutionary. What? Easier way.

Speaker 5:          01:05:00       I mean the whole thing is filling your belly. That's the whole thing. And everything you know, you can do to do it, whether it's with deer or whether it's with corn or whether it's with tomatoes or whatever. You can grow and you know, you just have to eat. I mean that's, that's the whole, the whole picture is staying alive back then. That's not whole picture today, so that's where it gets really complicated and that's where I think that hunters have done a really good job over the last x amount of years describing to people like, if you're going to eat meat, this is the most ethical, the most cruelty free and the most natural way to do it. And you're talking about an animal that literally like, okay, here's a perfect example. That deer mule deer that looking at right here, that deer had no idea I was alive until it died and it died instantly. It was boom, one shot, it dropped right where I shot it, and that's it. And then it becomes steak, you know, and it becomes delicious food that we ate. And that's uh, that's way better than any other animal that you're ever going to buy in the store. I don't care if you're talking about farm raised, grass fed, you know, locally,

Speaker 4:          01:06:09       I feel like your evolution as a hunter has been accelerated more than most practices. That's how you do everything. But you went from, when I first we first hunting in British Columbia was three, three years ago to where you are now. You've evolved in this like what you see as hunting and in our community and in our world and doing different things. Um, and in some ways you evolve from when I was a kid, we just shot deer. Oh, here's the spike, here's a four point shot this deer. And that was a great day. We drag it off and eat it and it's great. Now. I understand way more about what I was doing then and what I'm doing now. And I think what at hunters we need to be cognizant of and comfortable with is you changed your sensibilities. Change over time. You don't become a trophy hunter, you're not a trophy hunter, but you do appreciate the difference between a small antlered an animal and a large one as it terms of its maturity and how awesome it is to see a 380 inch elk or 200 inch deer. You know, you, you, you're pursued is different than it was when we shot that Moose. It is also.

Speaker 5:          01:07:08       But the also part of the pursuit is different is that I understand that the benefit of going after mature animals is if you're getting a mature deer, you're talking about a deer that's five years old, that deer has had five breeding seasons, has spread its genes, and by killing it you're going to give a chance to the younger bucks to that are coming up to breed. So it's done. It's part, it's spread, it's jeans, it's created its progeny, and now you'll take it out of a mix. And this is the right way to do it because then you ensure a healthy herd that like, especially for bear, that's the big argument. You want to take out the dominant males because the dominant males actually eat the cubs marauders, animals. That's the craziest part about it is by shooting a bore, you're going to save the lives of many bear. Yeah, it's a week in many ways. It's kind of a catch 22 because you're talking about controlling.

Speaker 4:          01:08:02       Well isn't uh, isn't a catch 22 that the, uh, younger deer tastes better. Yeah. And so like you're out there like I really love access to your meat, but to it when we're over there they're like, we have certain call box and there certain things you want to shoot. It's like I really access to your and if,

Speaker 2:          01:08:16       if I was out there just for me, I would have shot the youngest, probably not the youngest, but I would've picked a certain age group. And here's the argument against that with axis deer, that deer I shot was not young. That was a big ass dinner and that fucking things delicious dishes. Like they're better than that when they're younger. I don't need that. It's a fact that a younger animal is more tender and is a better, better cut of meat than an older animal for sure. In most cases. Not all cases, but that's the general. That giant elk that I shot where you saw the antlers. They're all delicious. That's amazing. I've been eating that thing for eight months now. It's fantastic. Yeah. I do the same thing, but I. elk is great no matter what. Yeah. Animals. Yeah. You're talking about two animals that it's hard.

Speaker 2:          01:08:57       It'd be hard to mess it up, but in general that's the, that's the matter, right? Since there's that argument though, you know why I don't like that argument. I don't mind chewy meat and I like, I like eating what I kill, so like it feels good to me on top of it tasting good. Like if I eat a deer that's a six year old deer. There's two things going on there. One, there's a satisfaction that I know the six year old is very difficult to hunt. Yes. You know, so most of the places where you have other people are hunting as well. A six year old deer has seen people that are hunting deer period. That's right. So that deer is going to be on point. That's a tough deer to kill. So by killing that deer, you get extra satisfaction. That's one. And then on to you, you're, you're, you're, you're eating this animal that you have this connection with.

Speaker 2:          01:09:43       So it tastes good because of that. And I'd like. I like meat that tastes like me. I don't want like Philemon Yon, you know, I like, I like a deer steak, you know, like, uh, the best a sirloin from a mule deer. I'd prefer that. Well, I would say like if you took conservation and organic meat, right? And you said, I'm going for. I understand both those principals. I'm going hunting. Everything's great. You're shooting that six year old mule deer, right? If you, if you remove conservation, you're probably not going to shoot that six year old mule deer because you're going to get a younger deer that's easier to kill, more tender, more delicious. Drink and shoot that. Bartow Garcia, the chef and the Montana. Yeah. He, he gets shit from other hunters because he'll shoot a spike on purpose. He's like, look, I'm here for the meat.

Speaker 2:          01:10:27       Yeah. As he goes, I'm grocery shopping. That should be in general. That should be okay. But there's principles that say like the shooting them mature animal is more beneficial to the hurt. So that's yet another complexity that we should all just say like, man, this is here. Just gotTa. Continue to talk about it. That's important. I think the way you approach is very important because you're entirely honest about the good and the bad and the bear thing. You know, like it's like it's not the best meat. It's good man. It's good, but it's not as good as elk. Yeah. I'm not going to stand up and be like, Hey, policies mean to bears the best thing ever. It's not. Some people love it though. I don't know if they're telling the truth. They're telling the truth, but it's just. I'm just. I would assure them if they would dabble other mates, they'll find that's better. I'm pretty sure. Well, I guess it depends entirely upon the way they prepare it, but the thing about this, an argument for hunting bears is different than the argument for hunting any other animal because you do eat them and you need to kill them because they don't have a natural predator. The problem with bears is like, especially if we went in Alberta, Jesus Christ to the art everywhere, people to think there's a shortage of bears need to go to Alberta.

Speaker 4:          01:11:38       The people that want to have one of those experiences where you walk away from that and be like, did I just do that?

Speaker 2:          01:11:44       Yeah. They're 20 fucking bears hanging out over there with cam like I wish we get. Can Call Cam Cam please text in. He's at work right now. Quit your job. Quit your job cam and telling you for years. Quit your job. You're too cool to have a nine to five. Uh, it's, he's got a 75. Oh, the Lord takes two hours. Launched to go workout and run the mountains.

Speaker 4:          01:12:04       Well, that's savagery. This savagery. He does

Speaker 2:          01:12:07       good. Seven to five Scott. Damn savage do. I'm not going to get my ass together and he's a legit savage. I know every time I'm complaining about anything to think about campaigns getting up at 4:00 in the morning to run with show, think about that like 190, eighth mile, 205th. He's going to do 2:30 for the summer. It only gets worse. My Dad was an ultra marathon runner growing up and it just gets worse. It's like smoking crack. Oh, they just get deeper into your grandma's door. I, that's probably a terrible analogy, but I'm scared of it because I keep running further and further distances. I'm like, what am I doing? And I'm doing it more and more often. What am I doing? You're, you're feeling a runner's high. Well, it's a little bit of that, but it's also like I feel improvement and I'm a improvement junk. Yeah, I know that I can keep pushing further. I'm going further distances. I feel better when I hit the top of the hill. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          01:12:56       Well my dad like, well, when I was a kid I remember my dad just being a regular, he must have been mid forties, maybe late forties and he mowed, we had like a fairly small backyard and he mowed a little circle and he would go out after work in his jeans and his loafers and like jog around the circle and it was very like. I remember looking out there being like, what are you doing man? How big was he hard? It was like maybe an acre, I don't know. It would very big and he was running like just little circles in this yard. Let me get to the end of the story. You'll, you'll get it eventually. But that was, that was his way to run. Right. And so after a while he started running, you know, got running shoes and started to get into the actual sport of running and then it seems to me like three or four years later he was like, I think I'm going to run this 50 mile race in the mountains of Maryland, JFK, 50 miler.

Speaker 2:          01:13:47       And had he run marathons? No, no. So 50 mile races. Like what? It was like six hours, seven hours a year.

Speaker 4:          01:13:58       Eight or nine hours. I think. Eight or nine. I think when you started or maybe 10. I think 12. The

Speaker 2:          01:14:04       cuddle. Interesting. Like eight hours for 50 per for a hundred. It's 24. Of course it is. It's like listen bitch, 75.

Speaker 4:          01:14:14       But my dad used to run. He used to run and places it was like the JFK, $50 up over this mountain. It's not like I remember you telling me stories of people falling and like busting themselves all up on these rocky cliff trails and he would come in and this is gonna make my dad sound weird. He's not, he's, he's awesome. But he would save his toenails. All his toenails would fall off during the race and he like save them, putting them in a little jar. Memories he save his boogers to. No, no, just toenails. Uh, and it was almost like this, like I can take that lack this thing. And then he went, ran 50 and then I think one time we ran a hundred and then he ran the entire c and o canal one time, 183 miles. And I was like, I think it was in maybe a senior in high school and I had had to drive to the checkpoints and like give him food and stuff.

Speaker 4:          01:15:02       He never started until he was in his forties guy, maybe fifties, forties, probably I would say. Yeah, like sorties. Did He, does he still do it? How old is he now? He would still do it if his knees would allow him to. He's mid sixties. 60 five is nice. You're fucked up. But he's still. He's. He'll still bike and he'll still. He hikes all the time now so we still has that like need to push push and he like when he gets around, one of his buddies in particular that they ran together, they're like old army buddies and talking about this experience that they shared together like remember that one time a mile, mile 94 when you tripped and fell and it's just like they're telling old war stories. It's like this visceral thing that they share. It's really cool. He did it passed. I mean maybe it's a midlife crisis man.

Speaker 4:          01:15:48       I don't know, but yeah, he wasn't predisposed to run 100 miles until he decided that he wanted to. Yeah. It's weird, right? That, that, that compulsion is a very odd one that the need for suffering. Like Cam's got it bad, it becomes a thing. Yeah. He's got a bat in a weird way. Or my dad, like he got a knee surgery and then like, well they said it was a acl. I think it was. Or it was the scope of his knee. He had an eastern scope scope. It's an easy one. But what if they cut his knee open? Can't remember what. I don't want to say the wrong one, but he had knee surgery and they're like, give it four or five days before you're up and moving around. And he was like joking around the backyard on day two, limping around. Just you could just tell he was in pain.

Speaker 4:          01:16:29       Oh, that must have been meniscus. Yeah. Something like that. Some tendon of some sort, but it was just like, you could just see this. This dude is. This is. If you can't do this man, it's not good for his psyche. If he can do it, he's a happy guy. Well, there's something that happens to you when you push yourself like that where it makes regular life easier and that's part of the addiction. It's real. When I went to Nepal, man, that's exactly why I came back. I was like, I brought back a sheep I killed and all that stuff, but perspective as what you were telling me how you were hallucinating, baby. I did. Tell me about that. Right? How high were you? We got, we'll have to. We were there.

Speaker 2:          01:17:10       We were like 13,000, maybe 13 years. 13. Five at 13,000 feet above sea level and so it's sketchy as fuck. It's sketchy. It's not something to mess around with. I found that especially on this trip, so we were hunting blue sheep in Nepal, Belushi, Belushi. What does that look? Look it up. Kind of like an all dad. It's got these little. Wow. It's got really, really. You can really see their annual. I like the. The age rings and their horns. They go straight out the short and stocky. It'd be cool to look at them. They were cool animal and it's one of those things where we went to hunt him and I didn't really have much of an idea of what blue sheep was until until we started getting into the thing. There's one. Oh Wow. Morales. What they call me over there. Wow. What a cooler can animal.

Speaker 2:          01:17:52       Yeah. Yeah. Mine wasn't quite that big and that one looks like it might be at a farm, but uh, because it's mowed grass and then maybe we don't to go mow the grass. That looks like more. I saw a very disturbing video of a goat eating a whole bucket of chicks. I'm a little baby. A baby chickens? Yeah. It was on. What were you watching? It was on an instagram page. I think it was either was a Jimmy Jew or clown in the homie. Yeah, that's it right there. Look this fucking goat. So I was just sitting there eating. This is on a youtube. And what's the name of the video? Jamie. They're amazing. Goat eating live alive baby chicken. So there's these two. There's several bins of baby chicks and this Ngo is just standing there and it just reaches in, choose one down and the goats aren't carnivores so they don't have the teeth for this and this thing.

Speaker 2:          01:18:50       This baby chicks trying to fucking clawed its way out. It's we'll get as much as he reaches in. Oh, he's just like, I'll get one. Oh, I can't catch it. We lost that one. That one lived. Look, he gets one. Here we go. I got your bed. She's just started doing. Just started chewing like what? What is happening with this one? Wild Impala. Fights back is its guts. Fall out and feel like you're really making the case for Christ. Predator hunter. Yeah. Look at this. This will know Paula is getting chewed apart by this wild dog. Oh my God. Do it. Don't stop it. Oh my God. But it's just. It's in the cavity. Oh Jesus Christ. That's like where the Bacon is. Oh God.

Speaker 2:          01:19:34       Oh Africa. You're a dirty mother. Look at this. This, and Paul was like, come on, let me. I'm stabbing you motherfucker. I know I got weapons. I'm like, look at your tail. Oh, look at this show down. This is guts are literally hanging out to the ground and it's standing up. How tough are these things, man and I. I mean, I would not want to get gored by that impala. Oh, horn. The dog doesn't neither. Are they on a road? Yeah, they sure are. There's a road right there. Paved road. We kind of just circles him to. We can attach them on the flank. Isn't it just messed up like wolves and coyotes? They hit the back legs first. That caused that shock and blood loss. I'm a big fan of cats because least cats will grab you by your neck. This motherfucker is not doing that.

Speaker 2:          01:20:22       This is weird. There's a whole minute 30 left of this. Yeah. Oh, there's more. More come in and he's like, that's it. That's a wrap on. They just grabbed the guts like how much more has fallen out now? Oh, how can it be alive? I have no idea. I don't understand. And they just go in after the leg. Here comes another one. Yeah. Oh No. It doesn't know what to do, man. Oh God. We're having some Vegan. Oh, dinner too. Just like what? Six of them. Three, seven, seven. It's dead. It's dead. Now. Look at that chunk. Oh, they just pulled the guts out and one watching. Look how fast they tear that fucking thing. Look at that. It's just body cavity. Now. Holy Shit. Did they drag the head off man there no jokes. And those guys are nothing compared to hyenas. Yeah, it's hard out.

Speaker 2:          01:21:20       There is the point. Like if you get hit by an Arrow, it's way better than that. Folks was like three minutes of terror. Yeah. We're going for the vitals were going for double lungs or a heart. It's going to end nicely. Is the biggest part with the Internet. You get from like, what's a blue sheep to that shit too? Yeah. Will you? You can go way deeper than that, you know? Yeah. I saw it. Got Chopped his dick off the other day. What I would. Yeah, I, I just for a Goof, I um, was looking at different hashtags online and I look for Hashtag triggered. I think I might've wrote Hashtag triggered in something. So I look for Hashtag triggered thinking I could find a post that I wrote. Oh good luck. There's millions. You're always. One of them was this one dude chopping his own dick off and they somehow or another got on instagram and I was like, how did that.

Speaker 2:          01:22:08       Nobody, nobody caught it before they pulled it down. Look, there's no way they can take down everything. Fucked up. There's hashtagging it though. That's savage thing. The guys were like, they were like, well, we're getting ready to get this done. What do we do for the Hashtag [inaudible] that's. We got to market it. Like we got to have people triggered. Trick. Hashtag triggered. Yeah. They have to market it. Isn't that funny? Marketing marketing is a big thing, right? You know what I was reading some mutilation, some fucking youtube, not even youtube. Rather. Some instagram person was talking about um, what they do to market their brand and all. They were like, I like a fitness person. And I was like, get the fuck Outta here man. You have a brand, you have 10,000 followers. Are you a brand or you just some dude who does squats Tuesdays, arms and back. That's my brand, my brand, my brand marketing team, working hard on my brand. It's like those, those,

Speaker 4:          01:23:06       those kind of phrases, people use those a lot and they won't do something because it's off brand. That's even a lead. That's an extra level of Douchey brand. Like I won't put that up because it's off brand for me. Who was like my brand, right, exactly. That'll fuck with putting out there. Seems quite preposterous. Social media. So tell me about seeing the baby and the polio. Let me finish. So you're looking for. Yeah, so we're looking for the blue sheet. So I'll start off by saying that we were hunting in a very rural, when I say rural, it's like six days walk from the nearest road where we were at the days and I said how many days walk to the paved road and they were like we don't, I don't know what you're talking about. Like we don't know we could engage that. And so we're in this remote region in Nepal, the in this district called the [inaudible] district.

Speaker 4:          01:23:59       And to say that the road from district is full of this, like primal primal people and animals and it is really just out their place. I think, you know, to be out away from civilization. That was the furthest I think you could feel. I mean, we were out there and the people, the people there were part of a civil war, the Nepali civil war from 1996 to 2006. This district was maybe the epicenter of the rebellion. There was a Communist Party rebelling against the government. We can step monarchy and so the people there are, are amazing because they've lived in this abject poverty for their entire lives and not only that, they've lived through this civil war in recent times. I think we think about civil wars, this thing we go to see a national park. Um, so anyway, we're, we're with these people were hunting. We go into, we get helicoptered into 10,000 feet, which is this knob in the middle of nowhere.

Speaker 4:          01:25:05       We hike about a full day to our base camp, which is a little village called dual arc in the middle, of course nowhere. It's like this terrorist village and we meet our Sherpas and, and made a bunch of locals. And from there we go up. We're going to do, I think we had two or three more days of hiking just to get to the area where the blue sheep live, so you're hiking from about 10,000 feet and I at our highest, we're at probably 16 or 16 and some change and so the first day we go up and we acclimate. We site in, our rifles were hanging out and we go into this lady's little mud, dirt hut. Essentially. It's just like probably half the size of this room with a little with a goat standing in the corner and a little fire pit sitting around this fire pit and they start.

Speaker 4:          01:25:57       She starts telling this story about how right where we were sitting during the rebellion, the police, the government police came in and shot six men right where we were sitting and buried him out back and this is like, this lady must be in her mid fifties and she. She looked like she was 80. I mean, she's just like this. It was this transformative thing for me sitting there listening to this being translated like, holy crap, where are we? And in the midst of that store, they're passing around. They had made this moonshine, which they called Roxy. It's just like made in a ceramic thing outside of where we were at. And so we were all just drinking and I wasn't thinking much about drinking it. And then we had one more day before we left. The next day everybody was sick, but me, I'm talking shit, your pants puke out the tent.

Speaker 4:          01:26:44       We had two or three people, shit their pants the next day. Like it was the, the Katmandu flu. Like everybody, everybody that wasn't native to that area got sick. I didn't on the first day. So everybody recovers. The next day we're going up the mountain, we're going up. We'd probably climbed about 2000 feet. We go over this pass and I'm feeling good. I feel like everybody else was probably feeling pretty crappy. Then we're going down this ravine and this river valley to go. We're on these like two or three foot wide goat trails probably. It's like if you go to the right, you're dead. If you stepped two feet to the right, you're going to die. You're dead. You fall off and you're dead. We've got 24 Sherpas, porters, we've got three or four mules with all our camp gear going up this mountain and a string of people, probably 30 people long.

Speaker 4:          01:27:33       I'm in generally in the middle and we stop at some point after we had crested this high point and we're going down and I remember feeling pretty good. I got my trekking Poles, I'm going, it's warm outside and I'm going. I'm like enjoying the view and looking around just thinking, oh my God. And then I. Then I remember pretty quickly being laying in the snow like, Oh, I'm laying in the snow. That's cool. Like I had no recollection of how I got there. What was happening at like. So you're hiking and then when you wake up I was laying. I don't know that I lost consciousness, but I just didn't. I don't think in my mind I understood what was going on. Like I kinda stumbled back against this rock wall and then just slumped down in the snow. I don't think anybody saw it. And so I kind of stood up and I'm like, you're okay. You're good, you fell down, whatever, maybe getting a little weird and I keep going and we had a little problem with the mules. These mules, we were going over the snow pass in the mules, couldn't get through it, so they had to turn these meals around, send them back. They couldn't get through it because the snow's. Yeah, I got videos of, of snow's too deep and you're talking to trail half as wide as this table. Maybe they're trying to get these and you're, you know, a thousand feet down to the river.

Speaker 4:          01:28:47       And so I, we stopped, we all stopped a second time to let these meals go back by. And like I had to hang onto a bush on the side of the trail as they went by and I got back up on the trail. You're hanging onto a bush for dear life. I mean you could, you had footing, but we had, we had filmmakers with us that we're doing all kinds of crazy shit. Like hanging off, hanging off cliffs and doing stuff. I will make a video. Yeah. To make film. They were um, and so we stopped. We start going again, most everybody gets out in front of me. I was slowing up and I'm feeling dizzy and I'm like, man, okay, maybe I just stood up too fast. Probably didn't eat enough today. I'm going, we're going. And at some point I just like snapped in the room was just like spinning like crazy.

Speaker 4:          01:29:33       And I was thinking and I knew about altitude sickness and I knew that I live in a place that's basically sea level and I was at a place that was 13,000 feet and I've never done that before and prepare for it at all. He should have can. I mean there's not really any. I trained. I did for about. We didn't really know we were going to go until later. So I trained for about a month and a half. Um, but not a, you can't train. Like there's no. They told me before we go, like altitude sickness, there's no predictor. You could be a rookie or you could be a veteran. You can get it like that. Like, it's just, it's part of the way your brain loses oxygen at those altitudes and it's, there's no real predictor for it. And so I don't think physically I was having any problems but so, and I don't know that I had altitude sickness, but anyway, the effects were I kind of sat down and I just couldn't go anymore because I couldn't get, I wasn't about to walk on this trail and I couldn't, it stand up.

Speaker 4:          01:30:24       Right. And so our medic slash interpreter slash producer Cameron, I'm Ben [inaudible] comes back to me and starts talking to me through. He's, you know, this dude's climbed everywhere. I've been everywhere, um, and as a medic. And so he's talking me through a little bit of the situation. He's like, this is not good. Like if you're too lazy to walk, no good. So let's get some water in you. Let's rest, let's get some food in. You see what happens. The meanwhile up the valley go to the rest of the crew to, to the next camp. So him and I spent like 20 minutes just going really slow and I just couldn't do it. I was like, I can't stand up dude. I can't catch my, I can't get my head to get back on my shoulders. And so we sit down and we're sitting there and uh, I look across this little bowl in this valley and I see this wolf.

Speaker 4:          01:31:13       I was like, oh, cool man, that's wolf. Get my binder is out. I'm looking at, I can't find it. Put them back. We'll go over. And I was like, Ben both over there and I see like, I see it as like, it's laying down. He goes, Shit. I was like, crap, there's no wolves here man. I was like, oh my, there's no wolves and all of Nepal. He's like, you're not gonna. See a wolf? Fear basically don't exist. They don't exist where we were in that district, in the, in the hunting area where we were. It's like, it's not, nope. So you were hallucinating. I was hallucinating, but it was not one of those like you see it and then you shake your head and it's gone. It was like a looking at it and it was just this, like what? It could have been stumped, but in my mind it was a freaking wolf.

Speaker 4:          01:31:56       What else? Losing my shit a little bit at that point I'm like, this is not good. And so then I'm sure in his mind he's thinking diamox is a, is a pill you can take to help with altitude sickness and he's thinking about, okay, are we helicopter and this guy out of here on day two out to what are we going to do? Because it's, you know, not, you know, pulmonary edema, cerebral edema. That's nothing to mess around with. It was only day two. It was, yeah. Well Day two of the actual trip. We were four or five days into being in Nepal, but they too have the, the trick in. And so we sat there for awhile and I like I just look in and I remember just looking after like 10 minutes, it's still being there. This is not good. And so we get up to go and I'm like, I can do it man. I'm going to do it because I don't want to leave. I want to hunt and we get going a little further down this trail and at this point I'm trying to like find some levity in the situation. Joking with him. He's joking with me. We're just like trying to be normal and when I know that my head's not normal, we're going real slow and I look on this side hill of this trail and there's a fucking baby

Speaker 6:          01:33:00       that's. I thought come on baby. Like I didn't say anything to Ben about naked. I feel like it was a really big naked baby if I didn't have a diaper on how big the biggest meet me. Like it's like 30 feet tall. I don't know Joe Dark Shit we're getting into. It was, it was an unusually saw. It was like a baby that

Speaker 4:          01:33:27       if you saw it on the street you'd be like, Whoa, what a whopper. That's a serious baby. Science should be studying.

Speaker 6:          01:33:34       Got It. And get that big babies is on the side of the.

Speaker 4:          01:33:37       And so I'm thinking like, I'm not saying nothing to band because this baby is like my ticket at home. Like this baby. If I'd be like,

Speaker 6:          01:33:44       baby right there, you'd be like q, the chopper. Right. See you buddy. Right. You can't make it sense.

Speaker 4:          01:33:51       It wasn't like the wolf. It wasn't like I saw it and I stared at like, I saw it and then I looked back and it was there and I looked back and wasn't there. So I kept going. I'm like, you know what baby, if you're really there, fuck you. You shouldn't be up here anyways. It's not my fault. Like, wow, you got a harsh harsh with the fake baby. The fake baby. I'm just going, man, I'm not. Whatever baby. Stay there. Wow. So I didn't say anything to Ben about the baby, like right off and we're getting going and eventually I just kind of collapsed and I'm like, look man, I, you know, I was talking positively and I wasn't hallucinating anymore than the baby and the wolf, which is enough and we get down, we get going down this ravine and camp. You can start to see camp guys put in camp together.

Speaker 4:          01:34:33       And um, essentially he's like, just give me your pack, community trekking, Poles giving everything. And he held my shoulders and just kind of one step, one step, one step for a solid hour and a half or so until we got to camp. A lot of breaks, a lot of just him and I talking about, well here's the scenarios. Are you, is this really, you know, is it acute mountain sickness or are you, you know, what's going on sick like the other people got so yes. So that happened the next day. So the next thing it was because of drinking that moonshine. I think we got sick because of the moonshine. It could have been water in Katmandu it commit to anything or how are they making that moonshine? I have no. I have a picture of it. I show you like it. It was, it looked like in this big ceramic thing.

Speaker 4:          01:35:12       It's probably a bit. Goat was walking over there licking out of it, but we all did it. Everybody in there got some level of sickness that wasn't used to that area. It wasn't used to being in Nepal and eating food and drinking the minutiae and all that. So who knows? It was the moonshine that was behind getting it could've been any. So we finally make it to camp and we're doing a film, so they're filming me while I'm all messed up and I was kind of out of it. I mean we're coming down this switchback trail to go into camp and I remember like not I much like when I fell I was like, I'm aware that my feet are hitting the ground and these trekking poles are hitting the ground and like I'm aware that I'm doing this, but I feel like I'm, I can't control it. I feel like I could be floating through the air just as well as walking. He a weird like head detached from body feeling. Wow. It was gnarly and I'm at the end of the day, I think what they thought was like it was the sickness that everybody else got coming on at the same time as altitude and it was just my body was fighting this battle against itself. So we got back to camp. I think I just kinda sat in a chair for awhile and said a lot of weird stuff.

Speaker 6:          01:36:27       I think I said like a

Speaker 4:          01:36:29       when I think I said, um, what's the name of this mountain? Because that's you got to know the name of what's going to kill you or something weird like don't this mountains out to get us. Joe, were you thinking about your family? Yeah. Hell yeah. Right. That's the first thing you think about what? Sharing the bad situation in the woods. Why did I come here? Why do I have to be this adventuring asshole and that, yes, that 100 percent. I think I was more focused on levity and more focused on like making jokes and making it seem okay, right? Because that's the only way that my mind can wrap ourselves around. Like, oh, hey, you dumb ass. You trained for a month. He went to Nepal, what do you do? And you're an idiot. You get a kid, you'll live in Texas. You.

Speaker 6:          01:37:07       This is what the fuck. What the fuck are you do? And this is your brain and body. Are you

Speaker 4:          01:37:14       telling you dummy, don't do this. Right? But at the same time I'm like, I'm here. It's amazing. These people, this place, the feeling, the spirit, like you know, you got to get through it. Like if there was anything to get through then you, it would be this like and so you get. I got hardened to that fact and I think eventually I had some water and I went to sleep and I woke up in the middle of the night and Ben, the magic was in the 10th question is a little medical bag and sleeping in there with me. So it was, I feel like that serious. I think they had a discussion while I was sleeping about do we just. Does he wake up in a helicopter? You know, does he wake up going back to Kathmandu, which is probably the right conversation to have. It's a Bob Seger song. Wake it

Speaker 1:          01:37:55       up and Katmandu.

Speaker 6:          01:38:00       That's right.

Speaker 1:          01:38:02       A baby and a wolf. Did you tell anybody about the baby or the baby? Eventually. Eventually, right at the moment. Then the baby was there. I'm like, listen baby. Wow. Let's make. Let's make a pact. I'm going to keep you under wraps for awhile. So you're basically like tripping balls. Yeah I don't know the science of it. Somebody smarter than me can tell you like what actually was going on, whether I was just a pussy or there was some actual scientific stuff going down. Parker joint since it's illegal, it's legal here in California. It's just hit me hard. Keep going.

Speaker 4:          01:38:37       I'll keep going while you're doing that. Um, so the next day there's more to the story to tell. There's probably so much detail but the next day we get up and I'm feeling okay. Feeling pretty weak. Like Ah, this is still not, not poisoning week. Yeah. Like that weird thing where you feel like you can't really make a fist like achy kinda. So we did a little bit of filming in the morning and it was like, hey o'brian, can you make it up for this acclamation hike? Right. Can you go up this hill right here? Good.

Speaker 3:          01:39:17       Uh,

Speaker 4:          01:39:20       can you make it up this hill right here? If you can, we'll let you keep going kind of deal. So they give you a test. I could test you on Brad. And so I get up there. I'd go with one of the guides. Roger, let me get up. We started hiking. We get up over this rise. I'm feeling pretty good shit. Okay. That was a bad moment in time. I'm going, but we're back. Sheep. Come on when sheep. Let's do it. And we're going. I think we probably had five or six hour hike into the next camp. We started getting into sheep country at that time and um, we're, we're hiking and I'm feeling pretty good and we get to a spot where our main guide mon had spotted some sheep and so we get to where he had spotted some sheep and I'm feeling tired. I'm like, we're going up as we go, so we may be there 14,000 feet or 13, five at that point. And um, we sit down and he's glass and the sheet, but I remember glass and I'm like, oh, okay. And they were like so far up, you can't imagine going that far to get him. And then I, my stomach just like, oh no. Oh God, my stomach is completely screwed.

Speaker 1:          01:40:29       But start going. You get that muscle but muscle or your butt, like when you're holding a weight that you're going to drop.

Speaker 6:          01:40:36       Yeah, that's what I was good. Jesus, let me say this about shitting your pants. Everybody on this, on this

Speaker 1:          01:40:48       trip was okay with it because it was happening. It was shitting their pants was like, it's not like

Speaker 4:          01:40:54       you're on a plane and it was like our camera guy. One of our main camera guys are non. Who was an amazing person. The whole nother podcast about that guy. He shit his pants I think during like day one and I don't know how many pairs of pants he had, but I remember watching him like scrubbing the shit out of his pants, thinking shit that's going to get interesting, but by the time we got into sheep country we were all okay with the occasional short or whatever's going on. I think it's fine

Speaker 5:          01:41:21       because your body's just like you're realizing that your mind has a directive. That's right, but your body is dealing with some pretty extreme conditions

Speaker 4:          01:41:28       and I wonder. I always wonder now looking back on it or like how well I would have done if there wasn't sickness and like I had some stuff like go to Katmandu and it's just dust and dirt and all this craziness and I had going into it like respiratory issues and then sickness and then visions of things and so by the time you get in there,

Speaker 5:          01:41:47       you know, it really makes you respect the fuck out of Jim shockey.

Speaker 4:          01:41:51       Oh yeah.

Speaker 5:          01:41:52       For people who don't know who jim shockey is, Jim shockey is extremely respected in the hunting world. The, let's just step aside with that. He's an amazing accomplished hunter, but maybe even more important than that. He's got a show called uncharted and his uncharted show is so good. It's so good that it really shouldn't be considered a hunting show because what it really is, is him exploring cultures in the most remote parts of the world. Jim goes to these strange villages in the middle of Russia that no one goes

Speaker 4:          01:42:28       to Ivan. I got all kinds of stories. Like last time I was at Jim's place up in Canada. I'm like, I said, he's, he's, what are you doing this weekend? I'm like, I fly home, hang out with the family. What are you doing? He's like, ah, Bison and Poland, they have bison and that's what I think is what he said. I can be, I can be the same kind of thing. Right. And, and uh, when I was, I saw Jim about a month before we left for Nepal and Jim had been at, you should, if you can find foot, the full episode of Jim's Nepal Hunt with his crew. It is, it. They filmed it there, like doing cell filming. That's kind of how I felt. Just like you're just a, you're just a mess. Just a mess. And I said to him as like going into Paul, Jim and like a month, and he goes, what? Like, I was like, well, what can I expect? He's like, it sucks. It sucks. And when somebody like Jim shockey who's traveled the world, literally the world, it says, it's going to be terrible for you little fellow. I was like, oh no, this is real. Now I'm going to be in trouble.

Speaker 5:          01:43:33       Yeah. Jim shockey has a a video or a, an episode of his show where he went to, I think it was Mozambique where they're hunting crocodiles, crocodiles, eat all the people that work that live and work in this village. Yeah. It is so crazy. These poor. These people live under the threat of monsters on a daily basis, like half the people in the village are either missing arms or they have a chunk taken out of their leg and one they were there. They lost a woman. She was going down there either to fetch water to wash her clothes, and she got taken out and these people were screaming and weeping. It was so hard to watch man, to watch a bunch of people wailing, just wailing because they knew this woman that they loved got taken under. By the end of that, the end of it where they cut the croc open and pulled a.

Speaker 5:          01:44:27       What was it, like a shoe or something out of the cracks belly shirt or something like that. I remember we were talking about that later on and that should be on a different channel. It's so good. It's so it should be on discovery. What's his son's name that films it? Brantlyn brand. Linda's a motherfucker. He is a bad motherfucker family. Either their daughter, but you know, here's my criticism of outdoor in air quotes TV. There's episodes like Rainelda's that are just brilliant. I mean Rinella show or shows rather like Rainelda's Rinella show is just a brilliant show. I mean, it easily could be on any other network. It's. It's shot by zero point zero. The same people that shoot Anthony Bourdain's show the same people that shoot a ton of award winning Emmy Award winning shows. It's a brilliant show and then you got these things that look like they shoot them with trail cams, a bunch of dip shits.

Speaker 5:          01:45:22       They're all, you know, they're, you know, the Lord blessed me when this bull came over the ridge, you know, like, okay, if they just think there's a. I'm a rampant anti-intellectualism, like an embraced sort of like a fake simplicity to it. Yeah. There's like heartland pandering that goes on all the pandering, pandering, skidway look, but then you've got Jim shockey who has this legitimate appreciation for these cultures that he visits all over the world. I mean he goes to these incredibly remote places and communicates with these tribes, people that live in the jungle or the mountains or wherever it is and you could tell that this is a guy jim is like, what does he buy? Probably 60 or so that he's getting up there and he, he realizes that he's lived a long life, has experienced a lot of wild and amazing things and now at this point in life what he really desires or extreme experiences of a humankind and also have a wildcard in nature and was like a different level to him. I outdoor TV, they is funny just because like I do appreciate and have friends that are like fall into that, you know, bubble zone buzzbuzzhome. Yeah. And I, and I appreciate what they do and like it's not for me. I don't watch it and I'm a fan of it, but I appreciate it. Other bubbles like it and it's a thing, it's, it's, it's hunting, right. But I will agree with you. He's

Speaker 4:          01:46:50       on another level. There's just a different level you could watch Rinella is cuzdey or episode where he just kind of like, the whole theme is like sitting in silence and like if you're looking for the right, talking about his dad talking about growing up and there's no music. It's this brilliant episode. It's wonderful. And so you could watch something like that and then every once in a while you'll see one where you're like, what's going on? It's like there's such a juxtaposition between what Steve and Jim and some of these other Hartland bowhunter these guys were able to like even cinematically produce.

Speaker 5:          01:47:22       Yeah. Heartland bowhunter, they do a really good job with their editing and footage and they do

Speaker 4:          01:47:27       really good job in remy, like solo hunters are really great timber timber net. Um, and so like there is this really good and like, I don't know if they're pulling up the ones that aren't so good or they're being brought down. I'm not sure.

Speaker 5:          01:47:42       I think it's either or, you know, like, you know what? Another one of my favorite is western hunter. Yeah, that's an amazing show. You know, and nate, Nate Simmons is fucking so good on that.

Speaker 4:          01:47:52       And, and I will say as a hunter, it's hard. Like if you really all you care about hunting, just want to read, read, read. There's a lot of bad information. There's a lot on television in television and

Speaker 5:          01:48:04       got like western hunter, which is a lot of really good information. It's public land and what he does is go deep into the back country hiking sets up camp and does it the hard way. That's the real hard way. There's a lot of the man. It's hard to tell people that to tune into a show if they've never had any appreciation whatsoever for hunting. It'd be hard. Yeah. What showed you tuned into, you know, I don't. I mean it would be there in my, there's three. I feel like western hunter, there's a few like into the back country is really good too, but meat eaters, probably the one that would send them to. I'd be like, narration that you're going to get and the intellectual understanding of like how to present these subjects and how to

Speaker 4:          01:48:48       I. Yeah. You know what I mean? That's what's important to me. Like as I get along in my life and career and like I have a son now and I've trying to figure out what I want him to know. Like it's important to me that there's good. There's people like Steven now out there representing kind of my thoughts and feelings in a way that I probably couldn't, you know. Um, so I don't want to try. I don't want to struggle with that. I don't want to like if he says, Hey dad, let's watch them outdoor channel. I don't want to be like, oh I dunno man. Like, so I, I, I do appreciate Steve for what he does. And there's a, there's a bunch of them that are really good. And I guess I would say at the end of the day I've always struggled with being in a room full of hunters and watching the outdoor channel because we're hypercritical of every little thing. Like why did he draw, why not draw? Well there's that, but that's, that's different to me. I think that flows into the actual, like the quality of the content and how you know it because

Speaker 5:          01:49:42       I feel like if I'm watching Nate Simmons or Steve Rinell or Ramey warrant and those guys I don't think should be second guessing

Speaker 2:          01:49:48       what those guys do in the field because you're, you're, you're, you have a level of proficiency. To me that's like the layman watching UFC fight and go, why didn't conor punch him there? And I'm like listen, it's fucking crazy. You don't think he knows when to punch and when not to punch. Like this is a stupid way of looking at it. So if you would compare the UFC to hunting television, there is no meter for how you get on hunting television. You have money and you buy air time, you're there, you know, there's just no, there's no qualified. We'll explain that because most people have no idea. So on the outdoor channel and sports. So I can you, if you want to put a show on comedy central, you have to make a deal with comedy. Central is good for real producers, for real writers.

Speaker 2:          01:50:29       You have to pack a jet. They're going to invest in it. It's a big deal to get to launch it right after tosh point. Oh, on whatever. They're going to be invested in it too. If is good. We do good. Everybody combined and the cable channels that are outdoors. Sportsmans channel is the business model is not that. If you. You pay the network for the air time. Essentially you deliver them content. They have very little oversight over what you delivered them. There's rules. You know how many times you can show a kill shot. There's like there's. There's what? They have rules. Yeah. Rules what? Yeah, hold on. They have rules on how many times you can show a kill shot fairly sure because you can't like shoot a deer two minutes into the episode and just dash is washed close up with a deer's eyes. The Arrow goes a close up on the Arrow is a good thing. We brought that red cameras all death metal and dying feet up in the air, kicking chicken or the egg.

Speaker 2:          01:51:32       There can be a show like that of Nutty fucking chose those of you that are like kind of metal inspired fear no evil, but. So there are God right there are like, I'm trying to be diplomatic and rugged there. There are um, some really good shows but, but you pay and there's some shows that are owned by the network, but that is the, the minority, the majority of shows are people who are paying for air time and then companies come in and sponsor their show and pay that for that for now. Weird though that a network on actual regular direct TV, like you can get to a channel six. Oh, five, six. Oh, six, six. Oh four. That's the, you know, what's interesting, the hunting channels which are like, I would say overwhelmingly Christian, like in terms of viewership and in terms of the people that are on the show are literally two or three channels away from black dicks and white chicks on direct TV.

Speaker 2:          01:52:29       The channels important channels are like five 96, five 97, and then he goes six, oh, four. Y'all are out here representing God's great earth and the beauty and the bounty of Jesus Christ out here in the like know you're always two clicks away from the terrible black poles and white holes. Next on direct TV, click, click, click. Jesus has blessed me with this Turkey, longer guyer and a freaking Hyena massacre. Electro is two clicks away. That's the Internet. This is television like you know, it's. Those lines are blurred. They're going to get super blurred. They're more blurred now than ever before. Steven Cole Bear said that the president of the fucking United States uses poutines Dick like he uses his mouth. Has Putin's cock holster? Yes. Stephen Colbert is very religious, right? He is. He said that when you sat it on television recently. Yeah, he's on the show. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          01:53:35       His idea was he was going to. This is the inside story. He was baiting trump to respond to him and finally after he said that trump did respond, call them second rate and not funny. All these things, ratings, dying, ratings, bad, all this stuff, and then Cole bear gets on TV and he goes, Mr Trump, out of all the things that I know you don't understand, the one thing I thought you did understand was show business. You responded to me. That means I win and trolled the president. He told the president fact that the president is [inaudible] is an issue. He's trolling as well as being trolled the bowl. Joe Scarborough and his fiance. Do you know that whole story where the president, a woman came to Maro Lago, but she had facelift surgery and she was bleeding very badly and he did not go. Did Not hang out with them.

Speaker 2:          01:54:26       He tweeted that, am I missing last week? I got to get back on twitter. It's so bad that scarborough left the Republican Party. What is happening in the world was like, look, if you guys are going to support this, he goes, I'm not a republican anymore. He goes, I'm going. Independent goes, I still have republican values. I felt still belonged to the gl, but I'm not going to do this. We live. We live in strange test, strangest the strangest times. Joe Rogan. That's why my tour is called strange times. Go to Joe Rogan Dot net forward slash 20. Can you tell this weekend will be there. You're going to be there. I'll be there. Yeah, we're going to be there for. It's total coincidence. My wife doesn't believe it, but the total total archery challenge is actually there at the same tile. Hunting is total coincidence. Total coincidence. I can't believe this baby.

Speaker 2:          01:55:12       Absolutely. I'm doing a show in the wilds of New Mexico in September. I always wanted to visit this native American reservation. It turns out that they invited me to hunt bison there. I mean, I don't want to go, but. But I don't want to 75 people coming to the show. I don't want to be disrespectful. Well, strange times it is. I don't. I must not like I do. Every once in a while I'll flick on a CNN, CNN or something, but I don't. I'm not one of those people. I've seen people in my life that gets so wrapped up in that stuff that it becomes. It becomes their reality.

Speaker 4:          01:55:44       I've never been affected by anything Donald Trump has done in my daily life. The healthcare thing is a different deal, but. But I think in my daily life there's few things that directly affect me other than something that seems existential other than the environment and freaking healthcare.

Speaker 2:          01:55:59       Right, but that doesn't even affect you or you feel it. You ignore it. That's part of the problem is that we don't like on a day to day basis. It doesn't touch your skin. It doesn't make your. Your nerve endings responds so you can choose. There's. There's a choice, right?

Speaker 4:          01:56:14       Man, you could choose to not. You can choose to create some sort of bubble for that news and politics and let only what's important in. That's Kinda what I try to do. I don't know if I'm always doing it, but I don't just turn it on and sit there and watch CNN,

Speaker 2:          01:56:31       Russia, oh man, I got. If I'm. If I see a restaurant on the street, I'll punch him right in his face. You saw the news report where the reporter, he admitted that this whole Russia thing is kind of bullshit. It's just for ratings and I was like, well, as a job, a journalism major. I'm like, of course it is. Yeah, of course it is. Of course it is. If it bleeds, it leads. It's. Yeah, it's. I don't know what's real anymore. No, I really don't. I don't want to ever say. I mean I want to look into things for sure that it's not that I'm not, I'm not thinking about it, but man, I watch house of cards too much drinking there. Joe Rogan. This is a not a sponsor because wasn't important. It's Zv. Do you know what I would like to know? It's a Stevia flavored soft drinks and yeah, it's 100 percent.

Speaker 2:          01:57:21       No sugar. This one is their energy drink. I think it has 120 milligrams of caffeine, which is like a good cup of coffee. Not starbucks, Venti I think as 200. So it's not quite, but a, not quite a starbucks. Venti not even a grand day, but it has zero sugar and it actually tastes really good. Would you like one? I would, yeah. Oh, you want me to shut down this motherfucker Xavia? Yeah. Sorry, that was really good. Soft drinks to do we have any soft drinks in the fridge or just the energy drink? Throw some of those soft drinks in the fridge for the next as a first time visiting California. I got to do shit like, like drink this. Cvs. Yeah. People in California don't respect if you haven't been here. They're like, oh, you don't even know what to do. Yeah, I've been to your many great airports but never.

Speaker 2:          01:58:10       Like this morning I went out and got like a parfait with granola. Yeah, there was some granola in there and then I got A. I went to the pool a little bit and did some emails. Nice and drank a sparkling water. Did you see any hose? There were. No. They were in travel. If you're going to travel next time you got to land in Beverly Hills or at least go to a hotel in beverly hills. We have the rest of today like we can. Yeah. I really need to see like the comedy. I poke my head in there. They go there tonight though, unfortunately. Yeah, we would have been those cold or no grape soda. So it is grape soda, but it's zero sugar. Try One of those. It's good. They're delicious. And by the way, not a sponsor. I was going to say, man, I get in trouble all the time for shit but not in trouble, but people accused me, send me emails, bitches.

Speaker 2:          01:59:05       They always think that for whatever reason I'm getting paid for stuff. I get people got mad at me about, uh, that Yeti thing that I did, which by the way, my friend Ben Works for Yeti. I'm going to be honest here. This is a Yeti rambler and will send me some Yeti things, but I bought Yeti shit before he even worked for Yeti and I was telling all amazing Yeti and you made that very clear to me too. I was like, ah man, I worked for Yeti. Now you know, do you need a cooler or something like that. Yeah. These bro. I already had two yetis back off. Brian already got Yeti's. They're the best. It's there if you've never had one and people go loose spoons with. You're right, you're right. You don't have to have one, but I'm telling you if you have the money and you want a crazy fucking cooler, they are the shit.

Speaker 2:          01:59:48       This is very good. What do you feel about the ones that. There's one that, um, that, that totally copied Yeti like in every way. But I mean, they copied the way. It's very flattering the way the logo is. And someone was saying, hey man, this one is like half the price and it does just as good. I'm like, okay. And then there was like this battle after I posted that in the comment section of instagram where people like their copycats. It's no, that's, there is debates. I mean it's a good robust debate on what's the better cooler. It's funny that Yeti has kind of, well yeah, I created the premium cooler category and then, and, and when you create a category like that when you and become a business, yet he is, you're going to have people that follow along and they kind of need us and we kinda need them unless whatever.

Speaker 2:          02:00:36       But as long as there's not, they're not infringing on the things that are our intellectual property, things of that nature. As far as that goes. I know as a company man, we look forward like we have stuff we're coming out with now. Things we're doing. We're not worried about people that are, that are copying. This is. I'll just continue to follow along. Look coolers, coolers. It's all good. But what I. I mean I, when I find something that I like, that's good. I like to tell people about it and for whatever reason people always assess why is that such a hard thing to get their heads around? Well, because it's, they're cynical and they should be because people are full of shit. There's a lot of people that are full of shit. But I swear to fucking God, if there's ever a time where I have an ad for like the ads for my podcast, everybody knows their ads.

Speaker 2:          02:01:21       People pay for those ads. When we were talking about it, that was my argument. I'm like, people pay for ads and Joe reads the ad. He never, he never just like frozen during a pocket pockets, like, ah, let me just pull out. This doesn't happen. And that's like Stevia. I have zero. I bought this, I ran out. I ordered these all on Amazon.com forum. It's very delicious. Yeah, they're fucking great. I drink this shit all the time. You know why? Because it tastes good and it doesn't have any bullshit in it. Like this is all just zero calories and zero sugar, you know? I mean it's grape soda, but it's clear because they don't have any per se. It's great. But look clear. It looks like fire and water. It's like the Zima. Right? That's great. He still loves him. It's not as easy add.

Speaker 2:          02:02:04       I don't have any fucking nothing to do with that company. They're not a sponsor, but isn't that the whole world? Like facts are, you know, people will assign their motives to facts and like everything. Right. I could say I work for you. Yeah, I could say he's a great cooler. It's the best I've ever used. I use them all the time more than any normal person because my job and I found it to be. I'm proud to work for the company because it's something I can stand behind. I still have people to be like, ah, whatever man. Right. You're just shilling for your company, Bro. But it's. Isn't it smart though that people are that cynical? I mean, look, look, but here's a perfect example. I rant and rave about the glory of a 1965 corvette. I don't work for 1965 corvettes. Okay. Well it's just like there's a reality about certain things that are awesome that people have created that I celebrate and I don't.

Speaker 2:          02:02:51       I don't say I'm not going to talk about z via because they're not a sponsor. I'm not going to talk about Yeti because they're not a sponsor. It's interesting to me. It's all interesting. I like, I like when people get it right. You have this like this podcast where you've done your closing on a thousand episodes and if you remove like all consumer products from the conversation, it would suck. The problem is people boiled down innovation to a consumer product. They boil it down to a material possession that somebody has to purchase. Right. I'm not looking at it that way. I'm being honest when I'm. When I'm looking at something that someone had someone create some new innovation, I'm looking at like, oh look what they did. Oh yeah. I wish. I wish I could have figured that out. Like what is it? I don't even think that because I'm not an inventor, but I do.

Speaker 2:          02:03:39       I do get excited about only archery side of things. Bluetooth. Is that really, that link I sent you? That is real. It's real. What's it called? What's the name of the company? The bread crumb tech. Bluetooth knocks. The problem is I'm shooting 86 pounds, so I'm here to have a strong man's listen. There's not going to be any knocks poking out. We can track those things. A lot of people tell you know through me to tell you, just to just dial it down a little bit too. A little bit. For Real. Yeah, for real. I've had a couple people say, you can't be promoted shooting that much poundage. I just want you motherfuckers check out the show might go this way. I don't understand why people don't. It doesn't factor into their mind that some people are stronger than them. It's true. Like if you pull 60 pounds, I don't feel bad.

Speaker 2:          02:04:32       I'm not upset at you. Look at these things. Look. So they shoot this Arrow and then with your phone you can track the knock through a bluetooth device that has some sort of a gps locator on it. Oh, you shoot it in the grass, which I do often. He missed it. That's my best brand. Bates. Brandon Bates from a or mef rocky mountain elk foundation. Good man. Let's get into America. Had on America. I got to America. Case for my phone. America, America. Nothing better than wait till we have the new studio and the America flag in the background. The flag we got sitting back there. Jamie. God Damn Gory. Have you previewed the new student? The new CEO, but he knows anything. Oh, okay. There's not a new studio when it. When it comes, it will be epic. You guys don't worry about it, but these knocks, it's going to be a good way to find arrows for sure, but what's what's interesting is it'll be a good way to track animals.

Speaker 2:          02:05:30       If you shoot an animal, like a lot of times people will shoot an animal and the animal runs and it's in thick cover and you can't find it. It's dead. It died quick. Like an animal can run 200 yards inside of a few seconds and die immediately and you might never find it, so if you shoot exactly where, even though you put a hole on each of his lungs. Yeah, the two inch dynamic diameter range brought out or one and a quarter or whatever. Whatever it is, it can run 100 yards. Examples that place we were at a Texas. Oh yeah. This place had these scrub oaks that were six feet tall and you could not get into and the animals you would shoot one. The guys were talking to us about pigs, like, yeah, we had a pig contest and shot three last two. What was wrong with you?

Speaker 2:          02:06:17       And it didn't make sense until you go there you go, oh yeah, hey, are you going to find that lead there? How would we go there? Like why would we do that? Well, we just need to trim that stuff. Yeah, it's just. Should've talked to them about that. I don't. I think they kind of knew where they were putting it off, but it was just like trees as Christ. You have so much Bush. Well there's any place that you hunt, like especially when you think about recovering game even though will not. You think it's fairly flat place. Like if I shoot a deer, I'll see it go down or whatever. It goes behind a bush or it goes over a rise and you go and you're like, oh crap. Well how about the place that we were at the last day where the grass was six feet high and the animals were in the grass when they were waiting.

Speaker 2:          02:06:57       What's crazy was ben and I were there. I shot at this one, deer and other deer that were like 30 feet away from us, jumped out of the bushes like they were hiding. They, they heard us talking, they knew we were there and they just laid low. Yeah, well they like, they laid low and then you shot an arrow and they were like, I know what that sounds like. Yeah. And they ran off and I, we knew they didn't cross into the next little paddock, like the next across this road. So I circled around and got up on this mound so I could see into the grass and I could see it in there. They're just like talking to her like, Shit, what do we do? Joe Rogan's. I was trying

Speaker 4:          02:07:35       to get you to go in there, but you were what, like six feet away from these things by the time,

Speaker 2:          02:07:40       by the time we got to him I was no, no further. Within 15 feet. Yeah. Jargon an to here that has sort of grown out of his head. Multiple pretty crazy, but they're just. Animals evolved to experience whatever the dangers of their environment are. There dangers are 100 percent people. Yeah. That animals probably four or five years old had been around people for four or five years. I was like, oh, I get it when people are around, they're trying to eat you, man. People have never gotten me in this grass. Yeah. Nobody else has ever been able to do it. So how did you, how did the Nepal thing and you get it together,

Speaker 4:          02:08:16       get it together? I think we left off at. I started to get sick while the whole next day I was puking shit and, and just, I had the flu. Everybody else got. But I just got it like two days later. And so it was that day. The first day we'd seen sheep, so we were three, I think four days into the end of the track and we were camping somewhere at 14,000 feet. And um, the next day the guy was with another guy that had a tag. Coal goes up, shoots a sheep and like six, like they climb up to thousand feet, 60 mile an hour, wind bursts, microbursts, frostbite conditions like these guys when they came back, looked beaten. And these are cold Kramer, who we went with is a Kodiak Alaska bear guide and a mountain hunter. And His hardcores gets. And uh, I looked at his face when he got back and I had just been in my 10 old day puking and trying to stay alive and I looked at his face and he's like, oh my God.

Speaker 4:          02:09:16       And I thought I can't make it over there to the latrine, let alone up this mountain to kill a sheep. Um, and so I kinda had resigned myself to like, this is it, man, I can't, I wish I was healthy enough to do it, but that's, I don't want to get up there and then have issues and not be able to get helicopter rescue. And so we, we talked about it but the worst part, and I'll just have to tell us just because it's like the low point of my trip there. The third night in the, when we got to camp, I was puking in the vestibule of my tent and all the, all the, the Nepali guys or are you okay? You okay? Okay. No, not okay. I'm puking and then fell asleep. Woke back up. I had to go to the bathroom. Then the medic is there. He's helping me to the bathroom, like I can't, I'm not gonna make it, I can't stand up, so I literally just Kinda like huddled over in the snow and pull my pants down and just write it in the middle of camp. Just let it go

Speaker 2:          02:10:19       and

Speaker 4:          02:10:19       I just remember do it. Like just thinking, oh my God. And I look up and there's all these porters, Sherpas with their headlamps on.

Speaker 2:          02:10:27       Okay, that's that bad. You okay? I'm like, look at me. I'm dying. And

Speaker 4:          02:10:33       so that was the lowest point of the trip and that I think the next day cold killed a sheep. The day after that I went up the mountain with a both in mid day just for another, like acclimation. Could I make it? We got into a group of sheep, didn't make it happen, but I went up the mountain basically probably 1200 feet, just a good climb. Went back down there like, okay, tomorrow is kind of the last chance because we're almost out of areas to hunt these sheep. And we went up the valley, I want to say like eight miles. I got, I got it written down somewhere, 88 miles and being on death's door to his store and I wasn't to be the 100 percent on it. I wasn't carrying a pack or anything. I just had trekking poles and a bio harness and I was just like one foot, one foot and we got into these mountain passes in these valleys where there was like two, three feet of snow and it was frozen on the top and you were just like every step you would crunch two feet down, like boom, boom.

Speaker 4:          02:11:31       And it was an hour of that and there was a time during that where we, we summited this, the probably the highest peak we were at, which is mid 15, close to 16 and I was just like, I can't this. I hope the sheep are right there because this is it like this as far as I can go. And we rested and we glassy sheep and there they are like a mile and a half away. Found this other giant ravine and up on this other flat. And I remember even the guys who were with looking at like, he's not gonna be able to go over there and I just, I just remember thinking like, this is what I'm doing it like I'm just going to go. And we slid on our butts, like down the side of this mountain. Me and two guides slid on our butts down the side of the snowy.

Speaker 4:          02:12:14       Icy Bank. Got Up, walked a half a mile, popped up over this ridge there. The sheep are within 300 yards. In about 20 minutes. I got, got on a big Ram and shot him. Wow. And uh, yeah. And there was no celebration. There was no, I wasn't even happy, I don't think because you're so out of it. Yeah. I think I just kinda like slumped over on my pack. I was laying prone is like slumped over my pack and like. Okay. Did you eat it that night? Yeah, they ate. The whole thing was not all that night. But Julian. Oh yeah. I was too sick. Like the spices that curry spices, even the smell of that curry spice. I couldn't even take like eight. A good bit of it. But they carried up your shit on everything. But even the tent smelled like that. So I like the cook tent.

Speaker 4:          02:12:59       I couldn't even really be in there. It was. I end up just eating rice for a couple days. I just couldn't walk. Couldn't stomach because it just such a gnarly experience. So everybody ate your sheep, like you didn't even bring it back? No, you can't bring the meat back here. Anyways. So the point was, so they had, they had mostly already eaten cold sheep within a day and a half or two days. And I'm talking 20 people, Twenty four, 25 of. Oh Wow. Yeah. Oh yeah. That burden and through the burning. And not only did they eat the eyeballs, we so call a shot a sheep and he was keeping out the head, take the off head, pop the eyeballs out. And I think jokingly handed to one of the porters like, ha, eat this. And I haven't watched that dude put it on the stick and put it over a fire and eat it.

Speaker 4:          02:13:42       Yeah, well I wouldn't. I mean that's meat. So they didn't see this personally, but they were picky. Yeah. They took the punch to the gut sack and cut it open, flat out the insights and took it back and cook that too. You know, it's Kinda like a Pegasus try kind of thing. And so I mean they just like, they just devoured the thing. Would you go back? Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm going to northwest territories. That's going to suck a then we'll be bad though. Yeah, that's what I'm saying. I think about like, I often think about like what if I'm glad it happened the way it did because I get, I got so much perspective on the way back because we still had two days to hike out, to get back to Tia, picked up to go to go back to Katmandu. It was two and a half, three days, hike out and hike out.

Speaker 4:          02:14:32       The first day we were hiking out after I shot my sheep and I had a night's rest. And I remember getting back in like midnight, I don't know, we, we got back at like 10:00 PM had left at six in the morning from killing my sheet and I was just so like emotionally, spiritually just fucked. And I remember thinking well tomorrow they're going to give us a rest day. And then the guide was like, nope. No, like it's too hot, it's too late. We're all getting sunburn. And I had like blisters on the roof of my mouth from the sun. My whole. My whole roof of your mouth. Yeah. From like going up and the sun bouncing off the snow. Hit your mouth. What's blisters? Sunburn on the roof of your mouth. Did. That's insane. Even heard of that before. I feel like that's a pretty common thing for guys that go that elevations, hikers and stuff.

Speaker 4:          02:15:17       Wow. It might not be. So do you have like sunscreen on your lips and your face and I'll you through. I did, but like I didn't really think about that because I was hot but I wasn't the field burning up. But like there's photos I look at now and I'm like, my lips are cracking open and bleed and I got like it was. Yeah. And if you watch shockey's episode when he was in Nepal, it's similar like they're self filming and it's like this pretty visceral. They get something out of that though other than the survival. So much out of that I got like, I've, I've written this now, I probably wrote like 20,000 words on the trip, but I got this like amazing feeling first being around people that are, that, not primitives the wrong word, but that removed from society. They don't have, they don't really even have the option to be modern.

Speaker 4:          02:16:08       Like they don't have, they couldn't get it. They couldn't get a chainsaw if they wanted to. Like they have an ax and they need to chop wood and like just being around that level of just primitive people and that they're primitive. The wrong word, I'll think of something better than that. But their spirit was so infectious. Like they're happy people. And you have these Sherpas, importers, who, you know, those big sick bags, the big roller top bags. We took one to base camp because they told us, oh we can leave it, we won't take it in the hunt. These guys would take like a 90 pound suitcase, put it on top of their head. Just go walking up these trails I was describing like it was nothing to put on their head. Yeah. They balanced everything in a basket on her head and all these porters a 90 pound bag.

Speaker 4:          02:16:56       And they would do more than that. Two hundred pounds. What? Yeah. Head strap basket back here. Two hundred pounds. Yeah. If not more than that. What kind of disc issues? Those guys, they don't care. I mean, and they're wearing like these guys are wearing like sandals and some of them were born in like old sneakers and they're just wearing whatever clothes that they would able to gather and they're doing these amazing things and when they take a break from something that you or I could never conceive of doing, they're like happy as could be there. Their perspective on life is only hardship. And poverty, that's all they know, but that's the only thing they'll ever know, but yet they're happier than, than I think maybe I could ever be. Does a big part of, uh, Sebastian younger's book tribe. A big part of it is like how living easy and not, not sustaining massive amounts of difficulty like most people do in these impoverished communities is one of the reasons why people aren't happy is that people actually need struggle, which is very counterintuitive for people.

Speaker 4:          02:18:02       It is. And I remember coming back, there was a bunch of moments that I could describe all these moments where I just like, I'd be at my wit's end just thinking I'm just a regular Dominican, like some adventure. What am I doing? And I'd get to a point where obviously pleased and I would look over and here become this porter, this 25 year old kid with a basket strapped on his head with, you know, 100 pounds of stuff wearing sneakers. And I got $400 Italian boots on and sixth gear. And I'm like. And it would always come with these opportune moments where I'd look over and I'd see that and pick, oh crap, like this person is here I am. Yeah, I am in physical pain and things are happening, but like to have the mental fortitude that those people have and they don't know they have it.

Speaker 4:          02:18:46       That's just how they're wired. And so I came back after the whole thing and I remember hiking out being like in the front of the group, all of a sudden like really feeling good. My packs back on my back. I'm like energized again, thinking like this best feeling in the world, that feeling of overcoming that thing and being on the downhill slope. I'd get back just for that feeling if I could catch it again. I think a big part of the thing of that is just you don't really appreciate what it feels like to be healthy until you're not healthy. Uh, I don't advise anybody to get food sick, food sickness or food poisoning. But one of the things about it as man, once it's over, you realize you go, God, like being healthy is so critical. It's like everything, it doesn't matter

Speaker 5:          02:19:28       your status, your money, the, your friends did that. None of that means shit if you're unhealthy.

Speaker 4:          02:19:34       Yeah, I mean, and it's the people in Nepal live in this. They just went through a civil war in the recent decades and these people were like at the epicenter of it and there, you know, our trip gave them jobs. It gave them purpose, gave like there's a lot of things. Our main guide mon door didn't have shoes until he was 13 and they used to go hunting and they would build their own guns and he described to us about a couple of times where like, he had never hiking and hunting sheep and the gun would blow up on his back and blow a shirt off. Stuff like that. They were like making, oh my god, muzzle loaders and using matchsticks as, as a powder. I feel like wow. So there was all these stories like that, that um, perspective perspective and like you can't let people say, oh, your trophy hunted that sheet maybe. But there was so much more to it that if anybody would ever want to see that just ate it. We ate it.

Speaker 5:          02:20:31       Yeah, I mean, what does that mean? What it means is people make a distinction that you did not have to bring that animal back in order for you to survive. That's right. So that's the only way

Speaker 4:          02:20:41       motive to me then, right. If they call me a trophy and I would say this, I would say look, you go into a war torn area of the world where after the war they don't have a lot of chance to make money. Like the tourism is kind of died once you've been through or it's really not a happy place to be. And plus the place we were hunting and the. It was the, I think that the rope, a 10 hunting reserve is like the only hunting reserve in Nepal. Like, and it's heavily regulated. Like there's 19 blue sheep tags a year. So you're thinking like everybody that goes, how many people a year go to Mount Everest base camp? Thousands. I don't know what the number is, but it's thousands. I think there's, we were probably within a couple of dozen westerners that had been to that area postwar and had brought 24, 25 jobs plus the people that prep that plus all that stuff, so like seeing that it's pretty powerful to me and shooting that sheep and not even given a shit whether the horns made it back or not. I mean you, somebody questioned my motive all they want, but within the system and the structure that's set up there now hunting is one of the more valuable things that they. One of the more valuable tools they have to get better at everything that their lives that they're having. It's their resource, the resource.

Speaker 5:          02:22:01       It's. Yeah, and you know, we can look down upon that, but it is a natural resource and along the same veins is like if you live in an area that has fracking, that's a natural resource. If you live in an area that, you know, they dig minerals out of the ground, that's a natural resource. It's not a good or a bad thing. It's just the reality of their environment.

Speaker 4:          02:22:21       And so there's so many. I think that there is arguments against what we did. If somebody broke it down, like I always try to break it down for me in the side, I think we will say like, why don't you just take pictures of it? You know, what are you doing? You just go up there, pay 20 grand or whatever you pay for hunt like that. Take some pictures.

Speaker 2:          02:22:36       Well, partly the challenge people don't understand how difficult it is to do what you did like to do what you did and then have this final accomplishment which is the get close enough to an animal where either it doesn't know you're there or you get an a good place where it can't win to you who doesn't smell you and you can take it out and kill it like it's hard to do so insanely hard to do. I've got all my own personal reasons

Speaker 4:          02:22:58       wanting to kill that sheep and I would also say like present a better plan. Then are you going to pay what hunters are willing to pay and already are you going to be a part of conservation regulation? The way that hunters are as a, as a trekker and a photographer like give me

Speaker 2:          02:23:14       better idea. Okay, but here's the problem with that. Their, their response to that could easily be, you know, what about if you decided to hunt people, if you paid a million dollars to go hundred person and that, that money fed all these tribes, people in Mozambique, is it okay to go out and hunt? People know there's surely still have an ethical and moral obligation to them to, to animal rights activists. Do you have an ethical, moral obligation to let that sheep live? Yeah, and I'm on your side, but I'm just saying on both sides. Like I, I, I really do

Speaker 4:          02:23:44       do like because we only ate it there because we didn't have a freezer full of backstraps and because that thing didn't occur the way it normally occurs for me there was some complexity and have that. Yeah. In my mind, crap man, you know, am I really ever here just to collect the sheep and bring it home and show people. But you also filming. Yeah. We made. Oh, we made what will be hopefully an awesome film and so at the end of the day I checked myself and I said, did you do it for the right reasons? And, and after I looked back the trip, I'm like, man, there are 100 reasons why I did it and they're all good and, and it was what we did was a good impact on the place he went on, the animals that we hunted. Like it's, it's, to me it's all good and I, and I would love, have argued with somebody that feels differently about that.

Speaker 2:          02:24:30       Plus you got the trip balls and see a fake baby and a fake wolf. People pay a lot of money for. Yeah man, you get mushrooms are expensive and you might not see a wolf. You might not, it might not see a baby on the road. I'm sure there's still like a log sheet or like a wolf shape log somewhere. Some rock had to be something. It was crazy. We got to wrap this up, man. Let's do it. I'm Ben O'bryan. What is your, uh, your twitter that you don't use again? I'm my twitter is at Benjamin Ob, but I've never used that. So instagram is always the better way to end it. It's Benny Ob, b e n n y o b three. Oh, one. How did you get three? Oh, one. That's area code where I grew up, but I didn't shout out to three. Oh one. Yeah, man, I created that handled when I didn't know it would be a thing. I thought that nobody would ever see that. Oh, well now it's a thing. Now it's a thing. Let's do it. We blew up, but when we had that competition with the people that you work with.

Speaker 2:          02:25:26       Alright folks, we're out. We're out for awhile. Uh, we'll be back next week with a one podcast with my friend Ari Shaffir on July 18th, which is the release date of his new Netflix special, which is going to be fucking amazing. It's a two part special childhood and adulthood right though. It is. That's what he calls it. What does he call it? Ari Shaffir. Look up bars. Sphere on Netflix. All right, see you soon. Bye.
