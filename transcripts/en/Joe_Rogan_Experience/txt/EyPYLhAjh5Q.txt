Speaker 1:          00:00:01       Okay,

Speaker 2:          00:00:07       Ladies and gentlemen, is the ces wrap up with young Jamie. Hey. Hey. So uh, you decided to go to the consumer electronic show, this big gigantic expo that they have in Vegas every year. It's like the show for new computer, gadget tree, everything and like anything you'd see at like a fry's or best buy from all the way down to anything that'd be in a car. Anything in a kitchen or anything in the bedroom? Anything. Consumer electronics basically. So the show is essentially everything that's coming out, all the stuff that's on its way out of things that have just been announced I think. And then I think most of the stuff that's supposed to be coming out for sale this year. Okay. So some of it is, we were just about to get into it, but we were like, God you got to say it for the podcast.

Speaker 2:          00:00:52       You were saying that some of it you think they're kind of bullshitting. I saw a lot of things that I just like, they might not be ready or their prototypes and just like at a car show too. There are some things are just showing you, this is what we can do right now. This isn't even what's going to be available. This is what we can do. Maybe if there's a lot of interests will make it. For instance, there was this really cool laptop that has three screens on it now, so if the gaming laptop that you can get some sort of crazy, but they were just prototypes to and two of them just got stolen last night or two days ago. So they're trying to get at them, take them back. So they stole prototypes. I don't know how that could have even happened. Oh, gross.

Speaker 2:          00:01:29       How gross to think that some nerds are thieves, right? Wouldn't you like to think that like whoever, you know, whoever you have to be to be an innovator in technology and electronics, you would have to be some super fucking smart guy. You would think you'd just leave every room open with people like that. Wouldn't you like to think that? I would like. Yeah, for sure you'd like to. But that's accounting world. I kind of threw them, but I mean that's fucking crazy. You know what, dude, I'm balls deep into house of cards right now. First season apparent. I didn't know. There's so many seasons. It started in 2012. Yeah, yeah, yeah. There's three, three seasons. I think that's it. I think so. Yeah. So did they take a long time to make a season? Yeah, for sure. I mean I think they completed it and then they shot the whole thing then read it again.

Speaker 2:          00:02:15       So there's a little bit. That's good. God Damn show dude. A spoiler alert. She anything, don't you? Dare you send. How many episodes are there? You think it's probably 11 or 12 and each one. So God damn. It's a good show that Kevin Spacey's motherfucker. Woo. Yeah. Good ups and telling me that thing is just the dumbest shit ever is discussing a show. Um, you know, like today in this day and age, it's not like you could talk about loss because it was just on the air, you know, when we were watching last, that's how recent this dvr thing and this streaming thing has gone. When we were watching last. That wasn't a long ago

Speaker 3:          00:03:00       man. And everybody waited until it came on the next week and you could dvr it, but you didn't. He didn't. Bend Watch

Speaker 4:          00:03:07       wasn't there even that, uh, they even did things that we had where they would show like three episodes and then take a four week break and then to show two more and then take another break. You remember how that would work. And then I think the writer's strike happened in the middle of it too. So there was a longer gap too. I think I came into last.

Speaker 3:          00:03:25       Well I think I got the DVD of like the second, the like when the second season was out of the first season. I think that's how I got into it. I kind of trying to remember now. I really enjoyed it up until the end, but I'll never forget this one moment. There was this one moment where they were all standard around this pond and it was like some pond that like brings you back to life or some shit like that. And they were like, I don't remember what the scene was, but it was something insane. And they're sitting there with their arms crossed, waiting for their turn to talk. Like the scene was so flat and fake. I was like, wait a minute, wait a minute. You guys are in front of a magical lake right now. You're not freaking out like this is. This is how you respond. And you just standing there with your arms crossed, just do another merger, Glueck, whatever the fuck it was. I was like, I can't do this anymore. I can't do it anymore. Plus they killed Charlie

Speaker 4:          00:04:20       once they killed Charlie. I was that Bonita that day as such. I was really. That's probably the best episode of the whole show. The whole. They tied everything together at that really good,

Speaker 3:          00:04:32       great show. That was up until the end. The end. Those are keys dot. Okay. We're good. Did you just happens with the show? It's right. It's like relationship sometimes. Just a guy. Okay. It was great. They're getting enough, enough fucking zombies enough this enough ogres

Speaker 4:          00:04:50       enough that that's Kinda how I am with game of thrones. No offense to those dare you well enough for the dragons and shut your mouth. That's the one I have in last,

Speaker 3:          00:05:03       any enthusiasm for, but I got to tell you, westworld was so good. I got sucked in so quick and I in the possibilities are so fascinating because they're their timeline jumping and it's just,

Speaker 4:          00:05:16       it's really interesting to me. It was kind of. They didn't, they weren't up for many golden gloves on that, but hbo didn't win anything and I only remember seeing one or two westworld people even up for anything. It's kind of shitty.

Speaker 3:          00:05:28       Maybe they missed the nomination date. I don't know. How could she not nominate? That show's awesome. Fuck. That shows good. That's crazy. Well, it just shows you if that is the case, maybe it's just there's a lot of other shows that are even more awesome. The we're just not aware of yet. This seems like the Golden Age for TV shows. It really does.

Speaker 4:          00:05:49       Yeah. The show. That one I hadn't heard. It's called the night manager. That one, like a Hugh Laurie who used to be house. He won an award for that and the other Guy Tom Hiddleston when another word. Somebody was just telling me about that. Someone's short six, seven episodes. I think it's a Netflix thing, right? I don't. It might be on Netflix now, but I think it was on something else to originally.

Speaker 3:          00:06:08       This is an amazing time for television. Think about all the great shows. I haven't seen the OAA yet, but I keep hearing that. It's amazing for. That's good too. It's supposed to be A. I don't want to even want to say what it's supposed to be. You're like, you're not even supposed to know too much about it before you watch it. That's the best way to do this.

Speaker 4:          00:06:25       For sure. A good way to go.

Speaker 3:          00:06:27       Like stranger things. I didn't know shit about stranger things until I jumped in. I didn't know a goddamn thing.

Speaker 4:          00:06:33       I still haven't got play on it yet. Fuck yeah, that's good. That's good. Don't let. Don't let red band steer you wrong. It's some things to see you just see a tweet some time to just what's in your head. I don't know what it is about the day you see it or the timing was like, fuck that show. So He's like, I've never seen it. I don't care how it would have been awesome if you hit play, but somebody says just it's the first thing you heard about it and now you're fucked. Yeah. And then you're like, well, sometimes you watch it and you're surprised. I don't even know how often that happens when you're surprised on some. You see,

Speaker 3:          00:07:07       it's so hard to tell because people's tastes vary so much. It's almost like they're watching something different than you who you are like as a person, your life experiences and what that show means to you when you're watching it. It's so different for all of us. Like for each one of us is different. That's what's weird about televisions. What's weird about books and music and comedy and pretty much everything. It's, there's not one universal awesome thing. There's some shit that like everybody goes, God down. It's good no matter what [inaudible] like, like Michael Jackson and his prime. You know, I remember there was this radio station in Boston. Uh, it was, um, I think, uh, pretty sure it was wbcn. It was either wbcn or Wcio Z. Those are like the two rock stations. Coc was a little harder. If you're a nosy person, you were like a little bit more into like Metallica a little harder.

Speaker 3:          00:08:09       Yeah. And bcn. I'm pretty sure it's bcn. They played a Michael Jackson song and Dez back when Djs could just play music, you know, was a different world. They could just play whatever they wanted to. They could just like as if you were a DJ right now and you had a bunch of records and you had an internet radio station. If they let you do it, I don't think you can, but if they did let you do it, you just play those records. I'm play whatever the fuck you want. That doesn't exist anymore. It doesn't exist. So this dude, I wish I could remember who it was, just started playing this Michael Jackson Song. He goes, I don't care why you like this is great music.

Speaker 4:          00:08:49       You don't remember the song?

Speaker 3:          00:08:51       Sure was Billie Jean. Okay. I'm sure it was billy Jean because that wasn't that all off a thriller was Billie Jean on thriller to. It's hard, I think for people today because there's so many superstars, there's so many different venues. I mean there's people that are superstars just from the Internet. Yeah, it was on thriller. Yeah. It's hard for people. I think today I think there's a much, much larger number of celebrities and have super celebrities, you know, of beyond ses and Jay z and Kanye West's. There's so many of those now that it, it kind of, um, we, we don't, I don't think we can appreciate today what it was like when Michael Jackson was in his heyday because there was like, he, there was one, it was one guy, it was one guy that just boom, there was no one like Michael Jackson, one guy who had so much impact on the culture. People were wearing those stupid jackets everywhere and dancing that way. I mean, Corey Feldman, Corey Feldman and Corey Haim, the two of them would go out and they were buddies with Michael Jackson, so they would dress like him. Me, it was a serious trend, man.

Speaker 3:          00:10:13       People wanted a. There was that trend and there was the other one with the hat. Smooth criminal, there was a little bit of that, that people were one glove. Was that a fuck? Yeah, they did. Yeah, it's hard. It's, I think it's hard for us to appreciate how crazy that was with no internet, just television stations and radio stations and much less people on the planet that's even weirder. So what do we have like 100 million more people than when I was a kid. What was the, what was the, uh, find out what the population was in 1980 in the United States because that would have been when I was like 13

Speaker 3:          00:11:02       because I was in high school in [inaudible] 81 to 226 point $5 million. Two hundred million more people here now. $100. Million more people here than when I was a kid. That's fucking bananas. Wow. That's an insane number mean. That's really hard to imagine. It's really hard to imagine you stop and think about what that means for another 30 or 40 years. If it's going to go up another 100 million, where are we going to put all these fucking people? I mean they say that it peaks off though, um, when cities and start doing better because then they start having less children because they, um, there economic situation turns up and then a lot of women get careers and they're more reluctant to give up those careers to have children and they have less children when they do have children. And so they think that if you look at the trends towards urbanization, there could potentially be a time in the future where we worried about a decline in population, like a natural decline. But it sounds like horse shit to me.

Speaker 5:          00:12:25       I've heard that too. I feel like Porsche, I feel like I've heard it, that it's happening now that it's not that we've almost not peaked, but it's, it's on a decline in some places for sure. I think I've read.

Speaker 3:          00:12:36       I think people are just moving out of those spots and coming here. It's crazy. It's obvious there's more people now than ever. It's a trend. It's 100 million trend in the last, whatever it was. Thirty plus years.

Speaker 5:          00:12:50       I wish I was trying to pull it up right now. I just saw an article yesterday maybe about how many houses are needed in Los Angeles to keep up with the housing required in 100,000 houses a year. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:13:01       They have to build a 100,000 houses a year.

Speaker 5:          00:13:04       Yeah, and that's like, that's silly. Oh my God, that's insane.

Speaker 2:          00:13:10       Because there's no room.

Speaker 3:          00:13:12       I did this thing before my showtime special in 2005 where I was comparing like mountains and lakes and rivers to what you see when you see a city, how it looks like a growth and then it's like a lot of other gross, like even if you burn it, like you got to burn it all off. Otherwise it just comes back and it gets bigger and stronger and if you could look at it as something. If you were outside of our understandings and our knowledge of what cities are and people and languages and communities and cultures and if you could look past all that, you'd look at these things that are growing on this planet. He'd look at this concrete weird fucking growth and when you break it out, if that's a real number. If we need 100,000 houses a year,

Speaker 5:          00:14:04       I saw this picture, this was on reddit yesterday or the other day, and this is a 60 square foot flat. It says in Hong Kong, I believe. Oh my God. Yeah. It's. It's basically people that I look. I don't know how many. This is two people living in here. It looks like, at least to. This is like a closet

Speaker 3:          00:14:20       and every time the closet, everything is in there. The tiny little refrigerator. Tiny little sink. This is crazy.

Speaker 2:          00:14:28       Yeah. Just sleeping on bunk beds. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:14:34       It's just this is not good for people. Yeah. Why? Why would people choose to do. Like if you, if you weren't a person and you were looking at this, you'd be like, why don't they spread out? Why don't they spread out? What are they doing in themselves? Do they like it like this? Does they have to be there? A

Speaker 2:          00:14:50       family keeps them there. Then the city or like from keeping for moving to Hong Kong, so we can only speculate, but I think

Speaker 3:          00:14:57       the population in Hong Kong, it's fucking bananas. It's true, right? There's just too many fucking people I. Yeah. I don't know, man. It just weirds me out. When you, when you look at people like a mathematical thing, don't just look at him like, hey, that's my friend Jamie. You know, hey, that's this guy. And I know that guy. Oh, that guy is cool. Instead of that, it's just looking at like math. Let's just look at the sheer volume. Then watch it as it multiplies and continues to multiply in. That one multiplies and keeps going and going and then the people move here and multiply and it's all multiplication. You're like, we'll, we'll, we'll, we'll, we'll, we're not planning this out or oh, we're just stack it up. Fucking houses weighted mean it's going to get to a point where there's nothing else but houses, if we keep going, I don't understand why people think that that's totally sustainable by the way. That's coming from someone with three kids. So I should probably shut the fuck up.

Speaker 2:          00:15:57       Did you, uh, have you, have you gotten further into Black Mirror yet? No, just two episodes. I just did two. I will go, I will watch more, but I really enjoyed the memory one. That was the one that you kept telling me, you saying? Yep, Yep. Well they had an awesome take on it too, that the um, I don't want to spoiler alert anybody, but they, um,

Speaker 3:          00:16:21       they were able to record their memories and that's what we've been talking about that for years that I think, you know, I think a lot of people have been talking about that because it's pretty obvious transition between being able to record memories with your phone, which is essentially that's what a felon does. You know, when you're taking photos and videos and stuff from your phone, you recording memories and how long before it's somewhere where you could play it on your brain. I could see it in your head and you know, we, we've, we think that I would, I would love to see if there is a way that they can even take photos that way because I know they can transfer images. They can transfer like an image into someone's mind now. Like in like very like simple, like a triangle and you see a triangle. Isn't that in that the latest

Speaker 2:          00:17:13       sorta. I mean it's still a.

Speaker 3:          00:17:15       okay.

Speaker 2:          00:17:18       I know you're talking about. Yeah, and there was one where they were able to transmit a word through the Internet. Right? That was more like a one and zero thing. It was like on or off, like are you feeling and not kind of thing. That's what it was. I thought it was an actual word or gotten into what a word is spelled that they might have spelled out the word.

Speaker 3:          00:17:35       I don't think it was a spelled out thing. I wish I could remember the explanation they gave for it, but I think it was like what that word represents, you know, like. So the intent of that word and like so the person on the other side, like I knew the word, like know or knew the word not or whatever the word was

Speaker 4:          00:17:55       says they were able to send the words Ola and chow from Indian France subjects solve messages of flashes of light in the peripheral vision.

Speaker 3:          00:18:06       The results described as remarkable step in human communication. Who that is fucking crazy. They're sending messages through the Internet. They were able to send the words, scroll up a little bit back where they were. They were able to send the words Olan Chow from a location in India to location and France transmitted signals directly. Wow. Like this is nuts. It's just hard to imagine how far that could go. You know they can do that. Now. What I've been thinking, this sounds like total bananas, but I've really been thinking a lot about it lately is that you don't have the internet kind of allows everybody to communicate together. You, you can have your twitter account and your facebook and all that jazz. I feel like what's gonna happen with this kind of technology and this sort of hive mind technology. It's if they can transmit signals from one person to another person through the brain with with this technology.

Speaker 3:          00:19:14       This is real similar to like when they first started putting things on message boards and the Internet and bulletin boards and like someone would put it up and then you'd have to check it and that was the only method of communication. Like my friend Andrew's talked to me about that a lot. He was on in the really early days of the Internet and those se bulletin boards were really primitive and this is one of the first things that people had devised to communicate with online, but now here we are 20 years later and it's fucking, you're streaming live on instagram and you're doing facebook live and you know, people are taking pictures instantaneously uploading them and they're gonna they're gonna be able to some way somewhere, another allow us to interface with our brain's the same way we interfaced using these phones and using computers.

Speaker 4:          00:20:04       I was just a way, if that happens, would, uh, I mean, I don't know how this work. This obviously was a two way communication. They're both wanting it to happen. In this scenario you're bringing up like, what if a, you sent me a message I didn't want, I will or I didn't want to have right then I didn't want. Right now I'm busy, I'm doing something else. Or You just blasting me with this message. Like, hey, hey, hey, wake up, wake up. I'm going to come to sleep. Or who knows what's going on, or I'm getting 10 messages from all over. I'm getting spam messages from outside too because they're going to be a way to turn it off.

Speaker 3:          00:20:37       Well, I mean we're probably going to be able to opt out of it, but how many people are going to opt out of it? Like, and even if you do, maybe you could turn it off airplane mode, you know, and like you do what your phone

Speaker 6:          00:20:48       at night if you're watching a TV show or something. I think that if you're, if you're really gonna keep going with this and it seems like they're gonna. I mean if they're doing things like this, it's not going to stop right there. It's not going well. We did it. That's awesome. Let's just leave it there. No, there they have these new batteries. Have you seen these new fucking batteries that uh, they're powering with nuclear waste?

Speaker 7:          00:21:16       No.

Speaker 6:          00:21:17       Yeah, the last for like 5,000 years.

Speaker 2:          00:21:21       I did see that Tesla's factory got turned on and they started making batteries. Oh really? Yeah. There was something about batteries being made with nuclear waste.

Speaker 7:          00:21:35       Um,

Speaker 2:          00:21:36       diamond battery made from nuclear ladies can last more than 5,000 years. Oh yeah. Put that in a cell phone and put it right next to your Dick. That shouldn't hurt him at all because radioactive sources in case safely within the diamond, the hardest known substance it would be safe to use. Say the researchers. Fuck those guys. They're going to open up a port to hell. Those guys from halflife. Fuck you man. Fuck you. You're going to put what? And you know the chicks are going to want God damn nuclear diamond. You know those really super fucking high maintenance checks. They're all gonna want nuclear diamonds, like a regular diamonds. Not going to be good enough. That's going to be the next top level shit is a diamond with nuclear waste inside of it. You see this a cremation diamonds. People are being cremated and turned into diamonds. Yeah. Wonderful. So what that those two things possibly related. It's cremations. Weird ways and you were probably fucked

Speaker 6:          00:22:41       can over nature by being cremated. We really are. We're probably fucking over nature also with a formaldehyde. You know, I mean there's some, that's probably one of the disconnects that we have with nature, like we don't absorb into it anymore. We don't, we don't, we don't just bury our dead and then let the body do its natural decomposing process and then become a part of the natural ecosystem. Now we've completely removed ourselves from it. We take the body, we drain all the shit out of it. We fill it up with chemicals we spray. Painted is weird man. Have you seen a body like that's about to be buried?

Speaker 2:          00:23:22       Not for awhile, but yeah, my grandpa freaked me out

Speaker 6:          00:23:26       cause I was like, wow, he's not there. Like, this is weird. It didn't, it wasn't. There was nothing good about it. It was nothing good about being there like that. It was, I don't want to use the words grotesque, but there is something severely damaged about the idea behind it. It was like, oh my God. I felt like I was watching some crazy ritualistic shit. You know, that was like reenacted from the primitive days of early man. I mean, looking down at this spray painted shell of a human, it's just, it's bizarre man. Uh, you could tell that's not. He's not really there. What is this? These are different funerals. What does it say? Puerto Rican gangster. Puerto Rico gangster. Propped up playing dominoes at his funeral. Oh God. As Superhero. Oh my God. This guy's in a car. Jesus Christ. This is crazy. I've seen. I've had like different disguises. Here's a boxer. Oh my God. He's a boxer. So they put him in his warm up suit and they put them in a corner of a ring. Jesus Christ. This is crazy. He's got sunglasses on. I want you have sunglasses and you read about the fight and want to see a crazy fucking picture. That Guy Joseph Smith Jr who just knocked out Bernard Hopkins first day on the job since he won the world title and he's got a photo of themselves, a Gi Joe Smith Jr.

Speaker 6:          00:25:15       He's got to. He's got two instagrams where I saw it. Maybe cHabad it up. Yeah, there it is. Look at that. Joe smith's first day on the job. Since he one. I mean, this guy just knocked out bernard hopkins and he has a construction worker job. it's crazy. It's insane. that's insane.

Speaker 6:          00:25:39       Hey dude, quit that job. As I say, do you think at this point he needs to do that? I don't know how much you got paid, you know, he might just be a and have another fight lined up or. Yeah, I mean, I think everyone would just assume that if someone's world champion that they're rIch, but it's not really the case. You have to be a famous world champion. the real, the money. I Mean the money's in promotion. The money is in, you know, a guy like oscar de la hoya in his prime. He was a, like a teen idol and also an amazing boxer or olympiC gold medalist that kinda guy sold tickets. Floyd mayweather sells tickets. Mandy pack out sells tickets now. Joe smith jr. His next fight will probably make a lot of money. You know, this was an opportunity for him and he capitalized on it and he knocked out one of the greatest of all time, but it was just weird to see them working. You know, that fight was fucked though. I know what rounded that happened in like the fourth or the fifth, I don't remember.

Speaker 3:          00:26:44       But uh, he had, he had been getting to bernard hopkins and it looked like one of those classic fights where the old veteran just as lost a step, You know, he was getting to bernard hopkins, he tagged when some big shots and then when he got him in the corner and just unloaded those shots on him and then bernard fell back on his head. I was Like, god, this is just so fucked up. It's just such a fucked up way to end an amazing career. Dan is just what that sport does, does what that sport does. There's no getting around that. If you're a 51 year old band and you're trying to fight one of the best young lions in the game.

Speaker 3:          00:27:25       Especially, he's not on pds or anything. He's not on any. I don't. I mean, I don't think he is. He might be. I doubt it. He seems like Just a super disciplined guy and his body sort of reflectS that. He doesn't quite have the same body that he had when he was younger, but he still looked very fit. Like when he was younger, he was a savage. I mean when he beat like felix trinidad, nobody gave him a chance. Everybody thought he was done. They thought he was old. I feel extremely. That was going to fuck him up. And he went on to fight for like 13 more years.

Speaker 3:          00:27:58       Yeah, man, he fucked up. Kelly pavlock, they thought he was old. Then he went to fight kelly pavlick and everybody's like, oh, this is going to be a bad fight for bernard hopkins. You know, he's, you know, I think he was 39 or something like that. I forget how old he was. I remember. That. Might've been a little younger than that. Anyway, he fucked up. Kelly pavlik. No, he was in his forties. Find out how old bernard hopkins was when he fought kelly pavlik after pavlock had already become the champ. Right? Yeah. I want to say he pavlock had beaten jermaine taylor. Right. And I think man, hopkins might've been 40 years old at the time,

Speaker 3:          00:28:43       cause it's just, you stop and think about boxers. In the paSt there was a few guys like archie moore, George Foreman, he was 43 and 26. That's crazy. And almost 10 years later he's trying to still do that with these murderous white men because kelly pavlock was a murderous white dude to murderous puncher. And then thIs, uh, Joe Smith juniors at ferocious puncher or he's just a killer. Bernard hopkins, like you got a one thing you gotta give the guy is amazing as his career has been. Even at the very last fight, he takes the toughest fight he can find or one of the toughest ones.

Speaker 3:          00:29:29       Just a real young dangerous kid. But it just, even though like we've seen it happen with sugar ray leonard, we saw it. I mean, remember when sugar ray leonard got beat up by hector camacho. I just in long. And hector camacho just beat the shit out of him. And it's like, wow, this is weird to watch. And he had billy blanks in his corner. Billy blanks, teaching them tibo dead. He had billy blanks. Billy blanks is a karate champion too. He was a yoke dude, and you know, knows a lot aBout fitness, but apparently triggered something fucked up with his calf, like you pulled a muscle in his calf. Then he had to get a cortisone shot before the fight. He had like a little bit of a limp. I remember would Hector camacho fucked him up? But the really scary one was Terry Norris when Terry Norris beat up sugar ray leonard. Do you remember that? Terry norris jr does. Terry norris. He put a beating on a lot of dudes. He was a scary kid when he was at his best terry noises like lightning. Yeah. This is when Terry Norris was, you know, world class and he was just a step faster than sugar ray. And you could see he's getting into him.

Speaker 3:          00:30:51       Terry norris, he had been knocked out a few times himself to man. He got gotten the war is one of the exciting things about norris was that he would, he would get hit, he would get in front of guys and he would, you know, really take some risks and one of the reasons why he was so fun to watch, but yeah, this is just, I don't even remember exactly how this fight ends, but I'm pretty sure terry stopped him. Oh, this is just round seven. I thought it was a highlight or. Oh no. Oh yeah. They got knocked down. Yeah. See when you see shit like that, like, whoa. See him, get up staggered.

Speaker 3:          00:31:38       We've seen this so many times. It shouldn't. It shouldn't be weird at all. Oh, what a good time for the internet to freeze. It shouldn't be a confusing to us, but it's just some. It's this story that repeats itself over and over and over again. It doesn't seem like anybody ever learns their lesson. There's a few guys that get out on top, lIke if I really do hope, floyd mayweather says fuck you to everybody. It just takes all that money. I really do hope he does that. I would love to see a guy get through the whole thing without ever getting fucked up once, like I mean if you think about what he's done, made stupid amounts of money and got through the whole thing, might have gotten her three or four times and it's whole career. Might have gotten tagged, never got beat up, never got knocked out. Just get tagged a few times over the course of how many fights. I mean, that's beautiful. Someone can do

Speaker 6:          00:32:40       that. That's like retiring as a bmx rider with no broken bones. Is that possible to do?

Speaker 4:          00:32:48       I don't think that.

Speaker 6:          00:32:49       No. Yeah. See what, what he's done. If floyd mayweather retires, he's done the thing that nobody ever does. He went out on top undefeated with all the money after having fought all challengers mean he might've fought pack y'all late, but you can't deny that he fought all challengers.

Speaker 4:          00:33:10       Hooky as fuck. I mean the 50 things seems to be an issue or not an issue. Forty to 50. You know, whether or not he wants to break the record. I mean how much of that as his ego. That's gonna last for. I mean, he's still pretty young, right?

Speaker 6:          00:33:24       Yeah. I mean he's, I think he's 36 if I had a gas, but he's in really good shape. I mean he takes care of himself really well. He's notoriously disciplined about workouts and he'll even go out at night, go to a nightclub, drink water, and then work out at 2:00 in the morning because he has his own gym and his own thing and he and he works hard. You don't get that good on just talent. You know, you get that good on talent and discipline and hard fucking work. There's just no way around it. And smart. You've got to be smart too. You got to be sneaky. You got to be clever.

Speaker 4:          00:34:01       Do you see, uh, who is training right now for a fight?

Speaker 6:          00:34:03       Yeah. He's a trained soldier. Boy, soldier boy is really going to fight chris brown. Is that real?

Speaker 4:          00:34:12       I don't. I mean, it doesn't seem like it, but it's been talked about for a few days now. Apparently it's going to be on paper view. Um, and fighting over a girl. Don't. I'm going to tell you right now, chris brown is gonna fuck him up. Probably.

Speaker 6:          00:34:26       Yeah. That's an angry dude that. See, that dude is on the left with the red. That's a real angry dude. The other dude, I just do not think he is angry,

Speaker 4:          00:34:40       but knows, man, I've never seen either of them personally know

Speaker 6:          00:34:42       one of them. Maybe soulja boy's been hide some sick boxing skills and just pretending this whole time, I doubt it. See, I feel like chris brown is probably punched a lot more people, you know, don't you think? I don't know. All, you know, wife beating girl beating jokes aside. He's definitely seems like a dude who is much more likely to punch people.

Speaker 4:          00:35:04       Um, maybe, maybe more likely to, but I couldn't really see neither either of them getting in like a street fight or anything. They've been pretty famous for most of their life and pretending to hm. Interesting. Since they're in their teens, um, two guys, shit happens. So I mean they might have thrown some darn down once or twice. Oh

Speaker 6:          00:35:25       boy. Here's another thing. Here's another reason why I say chris brown. Chris brown is a real fucking dancer here. See that guy move? Oh yeah, yeah. He could do some crazy shit. He's really good In basketball. Basketball. Listen, this is going to be a bloodbath. I might be wrong. What'd you buy it? Yeah, I'll fucking buy it. You know. And if a soldier boy fucks him up, I'll, I'll apologize.

Speaker 4:          00:35:51       Have a. I was trying to think about this. Hasn't there been other things? I mean, I know you were supposedly supposed to fight wesley snipes, but like wasn't there other things like this ever happen?

Speaker 6:          00:36:00       The whole celebrity boxing show. I remember That happened a couple times. Yeah. Danny bonaduce fought screech.

Speaker 4:          00:36:06       Um, he fucked up a couple of people. I remember when I was younger, there were supposed to be a big event where shaquille o'neal was supposed to go one on one on pay per view with this other big player named chemo chemo one box. Not box. They were going to come play basketball one on one for a million dollars, but it never ended up happening. I don't know wHy. Oh, it went away, but I was just kinD of wondering in my head like I feel like this is how I've heard things like this coming up and have like, or at least been announced, but that just kind of fizzle out.

Speaker 6:          00:36:33       Who knows, man, I mean, people have done crazy shit. This just seems like a really, really nutty one and they're fighting over a girl. I just. Have you seen any evidence of soldier boy's athleticism? He, somebody put up a video of him working out. There's a compilation of him working out. It's, but it's hard to tell if he's just being silly, you know? I was like, he's a, he's shadow boxing and he's riding an elliptical machine. He seems like a really young guy. How old is he?

Speaker 7:          00:37:07       Man? In his twenties still too.

Speaker 6:          00:37:12       He's in his twenties.

Speaker 7:          00:37:12       Yeah.

Speaker 6:          00:37:17       Well there's, there's a bunch of this complication here is so whoever they do, that was it. He was like, oh man. He goes, you're working out with your socks on. This is not the same compilation, but it was pretty funny. He's like, only real savages. Workout with their socks off. I don't know, man, it's just, you know, why do they want to do this? There's two, I don't know, they need a hug it out.

Speaker 4:          00:37:53       When you were talking about that black mirror episode, I forgot. That's the one that you saw. Uh, one of the things I actually got on and was seeing shown at this seat. Yes. Event was that I showed it to the other night that gopro gimbal I got. It's called the a karma grip, lets you hold onto it. I'll see it if you want, but this is some of the video I shot with it.

Speaker 6:          00:38:16       And so the idea is that it balances itself.

Speaker 4:          00:38:19       Put the camera, the camera's on you. So like you just kind of hold it and it keeps itself stem stable. So like as you can jiggle it around a little bit and it stays pretty simple. And this was me walking around. I have it at two to a double speed here. But this was connected to my shoulder basically. And I was walking.

Speaker 6:          00:38:36       So you taped it to shoulder? Uh, I had a velcro strap like this. I had a brown my backpack.

Speaker 5:          00:38:44       And so I was just kind of like walking around the event and here's one of the, here's one of the cool things I did see at the event too was a projector that's projecting on, um, it's, it's the stabilization actually stay up, but this, uh, this projector right here is projecting onto a curtain, which I kind of ran past it pretty fast. I wasn't really shooting my video for that purpose, but

Speaker 6:          00:39:12       let's take a shower curtain with like a pattern on it. Yeah. But it's showing a solid image on that.

Speaker 5:          00:39:17       Exactly. It's showing a hockey game and you're not seeing the ripples, so you don't need a flat screen for this projector. You can project it on anything. And I got three exactly. Or ideally you would want something a little smoother than that. But yeah, you could still have a flat image on that. So, uh, that was pretty neat. But some of this video is pretty cool on the stabilization. And then I went over to the samsung booth and they have what they're kind of showing here. Is this stuff flat flat hanging tv. Which different. Only way it's different from the things now as like when you hang a tv up on a wall, it's kind of hanging off about four to six inches. This is literally flat. Don't know if you can see right there. Yeah, it looks like I couldn't get very close paper. Yeah, but you can't really. I don't know if you could slide anything in there. It says it's a no gap wall mount and then there's really no cords hanging off of there either. It's one cord. No htmi. I don't even know if power was coming off of it either. It then one optical cord. So it's like using light optical cables. Use light waves.

Speaker 6:          00:40:18       So the one chord is powering it and providing the data.

Speaker 5:          00:40:23       See it says invisible connection right there on top. It's showing some of the data.

Speaker 6:          00:40:29       Well, it kind of makes sense. What would they can do now with these power? I should say

Speaker 5:          00:40:34       set a power. It hasn't, but it does. Do all the four k data does the htmi in every place has all of that.

Speaker 6:          00:40:40       But with these new iphones, with that, uh, what is that connection connecting lightning connector, that connector, you use it for sound like. Well, your earplugs. Yep. Your era earbuds, you use it for, um, an external microphone. You can use it for the charges if you could split it off so it charges it at the same time. You're also listening to music so both things can go through at the same time.

Speaker 5:          00:41:03       Um, another interesting thing that was being shown is some transparent, uh, lcd screens. So I'm trying to say this one a little bit. This one right here in the middle, discuss trying to show you. This screen right here is actually a full lcd screen pointing at the corner, but there's an art display shown over top of it, like an eight ink art display. So when you're not using it, when you're not using the tv, it looks like a piece of art hanging on your wall with the rest of the art.

Speaker 3:          00:41:34       Wow. Oh, so it's a screensaver,

Speaker 5:          00:41:37       basically a screensaver. That's insane. And there were a couple other companies showing some seethrough lcd screens that great idea white. These are all, still haven't come to market yet, but this is some of the stuff that they're showing.

Speaker 3:          00:41:50       It's so beautiful too. That's beautiful artwork and if you can do it with that kind of resolution.

Speaker 5:          00:41:56       I'm here. I was just, I looked at some three d, so the curved, curved, uh, monitors. This is like the most curved monitor ever. I'm still not super sold on these. I don't really understand why everyone or why they're selling them so hard. I don't really have an interest in buying when I've tried a few times to look at it, but

Speaker 3:          00:42:15       it's very gimmicky. It seems to me like, um, remember when those three d tvs were coming out and everyone was trying to convince everybody you need to get it. Three d tvs coming and I've watched it for like a couple of minutes with the glasses on. I was like, this is not going to work. This is not here yet. Know it's just two goofy that's gone. Pretty much gone. I think that's the same with these things. I think people are, you're going to use them for awhile then you're going to go with. But this is, why is it, why am I doing this? Why am I curving the fucking

Speaker 5:          00:42:43       screen? It seems like it's only for one viewer too. Cause if your curve and it's for the other people, then they can't.

Speaker 3:          00:42:48       It's fucks it up for everybody else. It makes it to one person. But I would say the majority of people's use of computers is probably one person. Right,

Speaker 5:          00:42:56       right. Yeah, for sure. At least one person at a time. So in this video you can also see kind of how crowded this whole event was to. Is. This is a. I walked 25 miles, I think my, my fitbit tracked 25 miles in two days. Wow. And that was the only six to seven hours per time that tired after that. Yeah. Dude, you had a workout for sure. And I was carrying around a backpack, a pounds of gear in it. But here's an interesting new laptop coming out. You can't really get a good view on it. I kind of picked it up. It's literally, I think it weighs less than a pound or right around a pound. And it felt like a, like a kid's toy. That's how the plasticky it did, I don't want to say it felt cheap, but it felt like a toy. It felt like you could just throw it like a frisbee. But it was a full laptop made by samsung. Uh, and had an lcd screen. I had a full keyboard, I had a mouse pad and they had a little, uh, I think it was a scale next to each thing that just proved to you how much it weighed.

Speaker 3:          00:43:57       But are you that much of a pussy that you can carry around a one pound laptop? Get it? Yes and no, but I mean the safe.

Speaker 5:          00:44:04       If you want to take one hunting and you need to, you all your ounces like oh yeah, well

Speaker 3:          00:44:08       definitely shouldn't take a laptop or anything. But if you did, yeah, you would definitely want to do that. Yeah. Guys cut their toothbrushes in half. There's a lot of like drastic weight reduction when it comes to those things. But I just feel like for laptops it's not that hard to carry one around and you know, you put it on your back and to me like features and a hard drive and

Speaker 2:          00:44:32       speed and that's the most important shit. Like yeah, it's not that hard to carry a pound or two pounds or whatever the fuck it is. Three pounds. It's not that hard. They haven't gotten that back crazy. I guess they are getting all lighter. Yeah. Means that doesn't weigh that much. Those retina displays are very light and it's beautiful. You know? And then they have the heirs and those are featherlite. You don't need anything lighter than a goddamn mac book. Air sure that. Nothing. Nothing. There's got to be a reason. There's got to be a small market. It also probably is way cheaper than a macbook air. I would have to say. Well you remember when people want it smaller and smaller phones, we bias fullness that big. I saw a phone once that like it was so small that like there was a dial for. I'm trying to remember how the fucking numbers were pressed.

Speaker 2:          00:45:19       There was some novel way of like they barely could fit a number pad like to dial phone numbers, so they had some weird dial thing to it. Trying to remember just reminded me, I might be making this up. Iphone prototype. It showed an iphone prototype. I don't know how it came out today or not today, but this week someone made a or showed video of how one of the ways in Iceland was supposed to originally work and it was using that scroll wheel that used to be on an eye on the old ipods. Do remember that? Yeah, so someone kind of hacked it together. I think on a current iphone to show you how this worked, this operating system worked, but it seemed like the aap obviously worst way ever to be controlling a phone because even I think you would had to input numbers that way by scrolling two, three, four seems so bad.

Speaker 2:          00:46:12       It was that really considered. I mean it's work. It's a working prototype, so I'd have to say someone at least thought it might've been a good idea. Well, it has to be that they went through a bunch of different ideas before they came up with the. Yeah, I mean I heard they're going through 10 different phones right now just to try to figure out what the next iphone they're going to go with this or 10 different testing models. So do you think that they've hit that point of critical mass where it's like unless something really huge comes along like a hologram projectors or something really bananas, you've got everything now you've got amazing cameras, you've got massive hard drive space, you've got so much you've got. You have all these apps that you can use. You've got all this usability, like what are you gonna do that's gonna make people want like a next generation and next generation and next generation. Like there has to be some sort of a leap because it seems like for all the technology we have today, people are almost like over computered and an over phoned. Right? Definitely for sure. I mean, I was trying to walk when I was walking around that event, I was looking for like either the big crowds to see what everyone was like stuck around looking at because this event was so huge to, to stop and spend five minutes at a, at a particular, I don't know, a pod or product

Speaker 4:          00:47:30       or even just let someone talk to you to take your time for that five minutes is insane because there's just so much to look at. Um, but at the same time, well I kind of lost what I was doing there, but um, I just kind of looked over at this thing I wanted to show you, which was distinct called vertifi, which is this three d virtual reality program who, um, they showed this guy over here doing a demo for it. I didn't want to wait in line. I really didn't want to wait in any lines there because there was so many people and I didn't feel very good to stand somewhere for 30 minutes. Sweat

Speaker 6:          00:48:04       young. Jamie got the same stomach flu that I had.

Speaker 4:          00:48:07       But uh, what this shows right here is this. I think I'm pretty sure that this thing on top of yours to camera that records the event. Hmm. Then what they were showing, this guy was getting a demo of it, which I wasn't seeing on this screen, but they did show and you can kind of see. I'm pinching his hand up there on top on this video. They show you watching, uh, with a vr headset, let's say a concert. And then you can decide to grab the lead singer and move them into your living room. So the performance this now he's not, I don't know, it was real weird how it showed it and I don't have it on this actual video. I went back and watched another

Speaker 6:          00:48:43       and so he's wearing some fairly small goggles. It was not, not a lot to what he's wearing.

Speaker 4:          00:48:48       Yeah. That's one of the, uh, one. There's about four or five big things going on there. There's vr headsets, different new multiple companies sharing vr headsets.

Speaker 6:          00:48:57       Was this augmented or was it virtual reality? Because I believe it was the virtual reality, but he reached up and grabbed someone, pinched it and brought it in yet. But it would have to be a little augmented because you were seeing it in your living room. You'd have to also see the living room. Yeah. If you go back to the video, you being there, like see, like when you see his actual goggles itself, like watch ice pass by a little bit on the can see it.

Speaker 4:          00:49:23       See that's the lead singer. Moved onto the couch. Just bringing the artists to our home. How bizarre. Which would I. I kind of like pulled into the comedy world. You could bring the comedian into your living room and just have performed performing your front and your living room instead of at the comedy. That venue that they were at, which would be interesting.

Speaker 6:          00:49:42       Yeah.

Speaker 4:          00:49:43       How odd. Uh, drones was a big a big thing. There are tons of drones now, right? Tiny ones. There's this selfie drone which didn't seem like it worked very well. It kept flying up and flying down different sides. I'm not quite sure how you're supposed to do

Speaker 6:          00:49:59       controlled. Go. Go through this for a couple more seconds to see that guy's a goggles because I think he gets see through them. See, look how he's looking. Yeah. Okay. See how you see his eyes. I mean that's what it seems like to me. I have that microsoft surface.

Speaker 4:          00:50:19       Oh sure. And there's a behind it too as a wireless vr headset. So they were, like I said too, there were a lot of headsets and there are lots of things and let's. Let me just throw out a number and say I did five tech demos out of those five, two or three didn't work or that didn't go well or that didn't work perfectly at all. So thAt's where I've kind of like, I don't know that a lot of this stuff wasn't maybe not ready or maybe it was supposed to be shown that way. And you're. This is like, this is our only demo product we have for you guys to see where it's supposed to work all the time. It usually does, but we've done so many demos today. It kind of froze up a little bit. That could have been happening to a little bit, but there is a lot of things going on here where they're just trying to show you some. Show you an idea and hope someone with a lot of money walks by and I was like, ah, that looks like a good idea here. Some one kid

Speaker 6:          00:51:05       go make it. That kind of thing. Like some 19 thirties carnival barker and know it works out for that. does that happen? Are there lIke guys who troll around this place and look for a. I saw products. I just walked by.

Speaker 4:          00:51:18       Oh, the intel booth and randomly saw a guy will walk up to one of their workers and say like, I have some patents on baseball, wifi technology, who do I talk?

Speaker 6:          00:51:26       That kind of thing. So that's all. there's tons of different meetings. Things sorting are happening by the way, in case anybody misinterprets what I'm saying. Troll around. I don't mean like a fuck with people on the internet troll. I mean like fishing troll. when you drag a line behind you go look for things to catch. Do you think that um, this, this was like the big thing in this ces though as far as emerging technologies with all this virtual reality stuff

Speaker 4:          00:51:53       every year it is a. Apparently it's focused on something different. Like this year there wasn't very much cell phone, anything really and used in the past years, like there's been big announcements of cell phones from different companies. I think I only even solid maybe one and it was this company called highway, I believe it's how you say it because they had a, they paired with this a really well known camera company called leica and have a 20 megapixel camera. They make binoculars and stuff too. Um, but I tested that out to see how good it was and I wasn't sure if I was holding the actual correct model, which was the one that had all the best features in it because I had a couple of different models out there. So much going on there. It was really hard to get a grasp of what you were doing.

Speaker 6:          00:52:39       That's really interesting. You bring this up. It's making me think like when you get to a certain level of this virtual reality stuff, you're gonna want to look through like the best lens available. You know, you're gonna want one of those high end binocular companies to come along and craft something.

Speaker 4:          00:52:56       Yeah. Yeah. I'm trying to remember right now. I want to say it's gopro. I'll have to google it for. I kind of say something off, but do you know, have you heard of the company called hasselblad? Yes, I believe, yeah.

Speaker 6:          00:53:07       Go camera company that they were the people that uh, had the cameras that they put on the moon.

Speaker 4:          00:53:12       Yeah, I think it's dji, dji mobile. Allegedly they were on the moon. Yeah. So dji is a arguably the best drone maker right now. They're biggest company. It's a company come out of China. They make a, the phantom, which was, uh, the biggest consumer drone and right now they just put out the thing called the maverick, which is. So they acquired hassle bad. Apparently they had a minor stake in the company and they just took a major stake. So they just took over the stockholding what's the correct pronunciation? It's hassle bland. I believe so, yeah.

Speaker 4:          00:53:51       So dgi is this, they made this thing called the maverick, which I got to hold up the event. I didn't get the buy one. They're not there on backorder still right now. They've been there for a little while folded up because each of these legs folds together. It's a a little bit smaller, a little bit bigger than this than my iphone seven s a little bit thicker. You can see that sticker, but the actual size you can hold it and it's about same size as the palm of your hand. HolY shit. And it shoots four k video. It goes up to, I want to say for about four miles away from you. Yeah, so you'd obvIously you're going to lose sight of it and it goes to I think 20, 30, 40 miles an hour or something like that. Something crazy and this is a bite sized god. Does it avoid avoid things or obstacle avoidance? That's what these cameras on the front floor. There's some on the back or the bottom too, so they have another versIon which is the phantom four. A pro I believe, which is a bigger version than this. They have an inspired, which is the way bigger version and then they have like the full film, like a film company would use, which has got like eight big crazy props on it and whatnot.

Speaker 3:          00:54:59       Do you remember when they filmed that movie? The twilight zone and they didn't have drones back then. They had a helicopter and actual real helicopter behind them doing a stunt.

Speaker 4:          00:55:12       which

Speaker 3:          00:55:12       do you remember that there was a horrible accident? Um, man, it was a horrible accident where the actor in this little girl were killed.

Speaker 4:          00:55:21       Oh wait. The helicopter came crashing down on them that you said that there was two people. I think I did hear about it. Don't even show me this dude. I don't even want to watch that shit. We can try. I didn't see it. Something. Something about

Speaker 3:          00:55:39       seeing people die for a movie too. It's like particularly gruesome. It's like why? How did you think that you could just fly that helicopter right next to people?

Speaker 4:          00:55:48       Hm. Well, with all this drone stuff, I'm able to kind of asked you this question because I don't know if it's an actual trend I see happening or if it's just something they're forcing or what, but there's just seems to be a lot of, uh, camera equipment being made available for the individual to use to make really high end stuff. And I don't know if it's the trend that people were just going to start making all this content. Are they gonna just start shooting everything they're doing? Are they just making it as technology and allowing that to happen for us? Well,

Speaker 6:          00:56:23       it seems like there's only so much you can do with it. I feel like what would they have to do though is have the best shit. So thing if someone has four k you have to have four k, you know, someone has um, you know, virtual capability, you could upload it digitally.

Speaker 4:          00:56:43       It's like fitness trackers were really big there. I still, I, I don't remember who it was that came in here. I think it was the first time burke came in with one. I sort of tried to ask him, I was like [inaudible]. I had one too for a couple of weeks, but it took it back because it got recalled, but I was like, what are you doing with that? The one I had at the time got recalled, it was for what? It was causing a rash on people because the battery connector wasn't. Oh, right. I don't know. They fixed it apparently now, but I haven't bought another one since then because I found out that the fitbit app on my iphone works just about the same and there's also the built in apple iphone apps now to that do the health stuff, but what w, what is everyone doing with all that data or are they doing anything with it? Mostly at all besides really, really, really into fitness. People like personal trainers.

Speaker 6:          00:57:29       Well, I think there's some technologies that even though they keep getting better and better, they're kind of ignored after awhile. like here's one of the most bizarre ones. His voice sound quality. Nobody gives a fuck about when anybody's voice sounds like on a phone. It's like it almost never gets discussed. Like, isn't that one of the most important things about a phone? You should be able to listen to someone on a phone and it should sound like they're talking to you and she'd be like, right here. Like, what's up jamie? Oh hey, what's up dude? It never sounds that good. Yeah, ever. but they have the ability to make it sound that good. Well why haven't they made it sound that good? People barely fucking use their phone as a phone anymore. The phone part is totally stagnant. Like the signal gets a little bit better.

Speaker 6:          00:58:09       You can catch a signal somewhere else, but it still sounds just as shitty as it ever did. It doesn't sound perfect. Clarity doesn't sound like you talking to me in the same room you telling me they can't do that. Of course they can do that. If they could get you to listen better now with a better sound now than then the rotary phones, the 19 sixties, they could improve on the sound quality, but there's no demand for it because people hardly talk on the phone anymore. So iT becomes one of those things where it just hits a certain point, nobody gives a fuck about it. And then the market goes where people give a fuck that people give a fuck about cameras. You got to get a juicy camera. I want a 15, 18, whatever a megapixel is. It sounds awesome. Get me one of those. Oh, it's gigapixel they have gigapixels I need to get your pixel. You know, how many people are just just buyIng the latest shit me included because it's the latest shit cuz it sounds awesome, you know, because you want that one. Oh, the asce has the uh, image stabilization that I'll never use. There's so much of that shit out there, but it seems so compelling. you know, like if apple had an iphone eight, you and me would be in line like a couple of years.

Speaker 4:          00:59:19       Like I still keep talking to. Sometimes I

Speaker 5:          00:59:22       think about this for the seven s I have. It's like it's either I have it, I like it, that the camera's on is really good, but it's so big. I kind of dislike it. How dare you? I liked the, I liked the smaller phone, I like to success.

Speaker 6:          00:59:35       Well the six or the seven, you know, you can get a regular size one, two,

Speaker 5:          00:59:38       but the stats on the phone or are, are down. It's not as, it's not as good as a phone as the seven. S is really seven s plus or we're a seven. Yeah.

Speaker 6:          00:59:47       Um, as far as the hard drive in as far as battery life. Right.

Speaker 5:          00:59:53       It's got dual cameras. The other ones don't have the battery on. This is actually really good. I'm very good. I'm super surprised at how good the battery is on his phone. Especially if you don'T keep wifi and bluetooth on all the time. You can last two days almost, which is way surprising because the screen's way bigger, but I don't. I could sit when the next one comes out and a couple of them. What a couple of months they're going to announce it probably in march or may and there'll be out by the fall like, or do we need it again? And then the answer is like why? Because we're shooting it has four k video on it and say, yeah, I one has four k video, but I've barely done anything with the four k video and the four k video I do have where like or with this go pro, I just got the new gopro five you have to convert all the footage so that you can actually edit it, which is like a big gigantic step that have tO convert it for you.

Speaker 5:          01:00:45       Edit it. Yeah, you can do a little bit of editing and their program, but to take it into final cut or to do what I did just to show you more than 30 seconds at a time I had to spend whatever, 12 minutes per eight minute video converting all of it. That's only because tHat's my. The capabilities of my computer. If I had a faster one, maybe it'd been faster, but they're slower computers too and it's just like, what's the need of the four k video? Then I couldn't even show the four k video out because I can't broadcast

Speaker 6:          01:01:13       how big of these files we're talking about.

Speaker 5:          01:01:15       Huge. For a nine minute video, it was like 40 gig.

Speaker 6:          01:01:20       Oh my god, that's a fucking giant hard drive. Back in the day, I think my first hard drive was four gigs. Forty gig for one file. That's crazy.

Speaker 5:          01:01:31       For what I mean, that's just so I could have two hours of gopro footage of me walking around ces to whittle that down and it's like, what is the normal person going to do with all that? If they went to shoot their kids, it's like they're going to have to have so many hard drives are going to become digital orders for sure.

Speaker 6:          01:01:46       YeaH. Yeah. You're talking about actual physical space now. Now, what is the benefit of that over like a more standard hd format other than the fact that just looks a little bit better. I mean, and really it is just a little bit like you're. You're really struggling between hd and this four k. It's like I. It's better. It's better. It's a smidge smidge better.

Speaker 5:          01:02:10       There was some eight k tvs at ces. K? Yeah, those motherfuckers. Several cameras that shoot ne k now.

Speaker 6:          01:02:17       Right. When you thought you were safe with four k now, what's going to be 80 gigs for the same video for at least fuck that. That's crazy.

Speaker 5:          01:02:24       Well, and that's the. That's kind of where we're getting. It's like there's no the distribution of this content. Now b is b becomes the next step and the next hurdle you have to get past. I was looking around a lot at three 60 cameras because I just got that three 60 camera and did the test footage with the way and that we did last week in the. I didn't personally just like how the footage looked. There was. I got a, there was a smudge on the screen which transferred over and it doesn't look very good and it wasn't at eye level and I was shoot, I believe I was shooting that in four k. It just looks a little grainy and messy and so I was looking around that whole event to just try to find. Because there were multiple, three 60 cameras and multiple. There was four k streaming, three 60 cameras and you need to. They all have their own proprietary software to run it off of a, but I did find one really good one which does three d, 360 video, which was really, really cool. But I'm also wondering too if I saw something, one really good edited video they made to show it off or if I was actually seeing this is basically exactly what the camera does. Straight like pretty much straight off of it because it was really cool. It's called the views camera and eye contact

Speaker 6:          01:03:39       you're getting. That's when you're getting into really bizarre stuff right when you're talking about like eight k video and they need to talk to you about 360 degree three d because it seems like if we're going to enter intO a real virtual realm anytime in the near future, all this ramping up of the specs or you know going from four k to eight k and then you know 32 k's just around the corner. They're just going to keep getting better at this shit. And when you're talking about something through like a high end glass, like a really high end, like a binocular type class and then having insanely high definition video and then having this exponential jump in this virtual technology where they figured out a way to really lock you into something that is not, it's not invasive to the point where it's not liKe fucking with your experience by you feeling it on your head. It's very light, you know, because sometimes you putting those bulky headsets and the goggles, you know, it's over your eyes like that's going to shrink up to, that's going to shrink up to almost nothing. And with um, with all these big jumps that they're making, how far away are we from some fully immersive avatar world

Speaker 5:          01:04:54       gotta be getting close.

Speaker 6:          01:04:56       It's going to be bananas. Do you know what's going to be like an avatar world that you could go go for a journey in? I mean imagine if movies, if what they become. Because you know, think about how these serial shows like sopranos and then ultimately, you know, game oF and a lot of these other great shows, they, they catch you and they rope you in and they bring you into a world and then you follow that world episode after episode and you get sucked into it, right? It's very different than a regular movie. What did they start doing? These cereal? I mean, I think of like game of thrones is a serial movie, right? There's a hundred parts to this movie, but it's a big giant ass movie. I mean, it's, it's, it's so much better than a regular television show in terms of like it's special effects and the grandness of it all.

Speaker 6:          01:05:53       If they can figure out how to film something like that, but let you participate in it. I mean, uh, let you strap on to some three d treadmill type thing and move around in this fucking weird world and follow these people on their journeys. Be right there when the orc slaughter the people, like the blood splatter in front of you and you're watching theM get chopped up and then you're going to go over the mountain to where the castle is. You have to actually walk over the mountain, but as you walk over the mountain, horses ride beside you. You get to see them.

Speaker 4:          01:06:34       I mean,

Speaker 6:          01:06:35       we're real close to something like that. I feel like that's only a few years away.

Speaker 4:          01:06:41       Avatar world coming out soon. Like in disney at disney disney world. What are they going to do? How's that going to work? They've been showing some things like this is, I think this is just a imagineering, whoa idea, but just like you're gonna be able to take a boat ride through the middle of the navi forest.

Speaker 6:          01:06:57       Oh, okay. Well that looks like it's a small world. Yeah,

Speaker 4:          01:06:59       it's going to be a little bit of a step, but they're going to have some vr stuff. You're gonna be able to float through and go on the uh, whoa. Here's how they look and disney world right now. Oh wow. So they're, they're building it right now. You're obviously not going to have to walk on that. When is this going to take place? I think it opens this later this year. Disneyland does not next year, but what you're saying, what else? They just took the extension of that and just instead of like making the avatar movie, they just went, look, avatar is avatar world and if you want to come live it out, you've got to come to disney world and pay 50 bucks. 100 bucks or $150 bucks, 300 bucks. Something crazy to do it.

Speaker 6:          01:07:38       Now you're talking. That would be, this is what you do. You construct that world and then once you're in that world, then you put on the vr goggles and it turns everything into fluorescent neon greens and blues and like the avatar world. You could see everything and then you actually watched the movie play out in there.

Speaker 4:          01:07:58       That would be a nerd gas. I feel like they're way closer to something like that. Then we are everyone being able to do with this app.

Speaker 6:          01:08:07       Well, the thing about that though is it's going to require so much resources and land and money and it's Just, I feel like a three d treadmill and uh, you know, where you can't, you don't phySically go anywhere, you're not going to be able to go up hills and you're not gonna, you're not gonna feel a sensation of walking, climbing things. That's the only difference, but you'll be able to be like right in front of it, but it won't feel like grass. You know what I mean? Like if they could figure out a way to do a virtual world where somehow or another you could change the textiles on the ground or changed the way it feels, the tactile sensation of what you're stepping on. If you can make it feel like water. If you can make it feel like grass or dirt. If they could start doing shit like that, that doesn't seem outside. The realm of possibility Just seems like something way too smart for a dummy like me to figure out.

Speaker 5:          01:09:02       So there's one technology at cds, there's a couple things there I didn't get a chance to even see.

Speaker 6:          01:09:08       WHat does it say wants to let you feel fabric through your touch screen? Whoa. Yeah. I hand invis

Speaker 5:          01:09:16       I find it there. There are a lot of places I think I was trying to find that I couldn't hear

Speaker 6:          01:09:19       and actually just find, you know, dudes are going to use that for just gonna rub girls' panties and porn films and it's going to be the only application for it. Oh, it's right there. Touch it. The idea of it sounds pretty interesting though. Yeah, I mean you can, you can have a like a, a bump to it. So is it working on an ipad or something with a.

Speaker 5:          01:09:39       It uses a little bit of like the haptic feedback that is already built into some of these things, but it uses it differently.

Speaker 6:          01:09:45       So that was what it was kind of cool about. Um, the htc vibe is that haptic feedback because when you're doing the bow and arrow thing, it really does kind of feel like you're drawing the arrow back, gives you a little bit of vibration as if the arrow is pulling across the arrow restaurants rubbing on it. It's really cool.

Speaker 5:          01:10:02       So they just made some announcements to, they didn't, they're not going to make a new vibe yet, but uh, they showed a new head set attachment that makes the vibe put on your head a little bit more comfortably and this showed what they're calling the tracker, which is essentially the end of the controller which can be attached to. They said anything. So it depends what a developer makes it work with, but one of the things they showed as it were on the end of a gun told us to like play different gun games. They put on the end of a baseball bat and a baseball bat. Then you could, you could see the bat and the vive game that you were playing or the baseball simulation you were playing, but they could pull in real major league baseball pitches, actual data because they have them all from the last, I don't know, five to 10 years. Any pitch from any picture you want to see. You can have now come at you and you can go ahead and try to hit it. Oh my god. Probably then put you theoretically at any park you want or wherever the hell you want to be swinging baseball bats.

Speaker 6:          01:10:55       How many dudes are going to be blown their shoulders apart? Well, swinging in the air with this thing, hopefully you're not bashing your house up to, but like that idea can be expounded on. Now would you, uh, I would think that if you were going to do something like that, you would want to do it with a bat that's like the same weight as a real bat.

Speaker 5:          01:11:14       You'd probably want the x. They had an actual wooden baseball bat. They just screwed the thing on the bottom. Oh, that's great. Yeah. So you could do it with that. You could probably have a sword. You could probably have a.

Speaker 6:          01:11:24       Oh shit. Yeah. If you had a sword, do you know, kind of a fucking awesome workout you would get. My arms were so tired at dunkin's place just for playing his archery thing and I'm not even pulling anything back. I'm just holding my arm up. Like there's no, there's no actual resistance pulling the bow back, but just holding your arms straight in front of you and doing this over and over again. my arms were killing me, man. I was like, this is amazing. Like this actually has some physical benefit to it. And the boxing game, the boxing game has real benefit to it. Like the boxing game, I think you could, you could learn how a person moves and how it feels like to spar with them. You see punches come at, you can learn how to slip punches, you can learn how to counter with things. You don't feel hitting anything. That's the only thing that's missing and you don't feel them hitting you. But at least when they hit you, you see like spark.

Speaker 5:          01:12:15       So, uh, one of the try to find that a little bit really. It's not worth me pumped the video. But uh, there was a haptic feedback, a essentially a backpack slash chest thing you put on for vr that would give you some sort of shocks or you'd feel something. I don't know how hard it would feel should jolt the shit out of you. There was another, there's a company that in the video I watched showing the data trackers that they were adding onto different, uh, devices. They put it on a fire hose and they also put a jacket on you that had heaters in it. So your boy putting out a fire and that's given you feedback of the hose. It's also getting warmer and you're getting hot. So like there's different. I don't, that's not really a game as more of it as a simulation or it is a training training tool for an actual fire company.

Speaker 6:          01:13:01       Well, it's also to let you know like what's the potential for like a doom game from 2000

Speaker 5:          01:13:06       for 24. Yeah. Maybe not even. Maybe two years from now. Hopefully we'll see what happens at e three this year with what these companies are going to announce with the new xbox is supposedly supposedly going to have a vr.

Speaker 6:          01:13:17       If someone comes up with a haptic feedback suit that's able to get hot and cold and vibrate and jolt and even give you a little bit of pain. Yeah, you need something, you need a little bit of pain, a little fucker, you know, where you're really feeling it.

Speaker 5:          01:13:35       Remember that was that, uh, I don't know which James Bond movie it was where they were holding on to the. There's some sort of like stick they're holding onto and like the loser, it just gets more painful and like trying. It's like a man man versus man contest, but there's a bunch of, like at a cocktail party.

Speaker 6:          01:13:50       I don't remember that one. I'm, I avoided a lot of those James Bond movies. Eddie bravo said something to me a long time ago and it fucked me up. We were talking about, um, it wasn't a conspiracy thing. We were talking about, uh, like action movies and he's like, the problem with this action movies is you always know who's going to live. The guys always going to live like he never. Oh yeah. He's going to hang by fucking thread. Yep. He's gonna make it. He's gonna live, you know he's going to live. I'm like, you motherfucker. Like I knew that. Of course I knew that you go to see the terminator or you go to see a predator. You don't think that arnold schwarzenegger is going to get killed by the alien at the end. No. You think that's actually really bad for us, isn't it?

Speaker 6:          01:14:36       It's really bad to have the the good guy when and all of them. That's why I think like no country for old men is probably important. So important to know that sometimes the guy who you think's gonna live gets shot in the last couple of minutes of the movie and the other guy just wanders off spoiler, and that's the end of the movie and you're like, what the fuck kind of movie is this? Well, that's a movie that's more like a real live story. Arnold can't beat that alien. You know it. I know it. That thing's gonna. Fuck him up. Why are we pretending this is stupid? It's not a world where I can imagine that predator losing to arnold schwartzenegger I can't see, aren't ongoing at the donald. The other day, no I didn't, but I can't believe that donald wanted arnold. He's the god damn president sir. Down of course. Well he see he compared it to his first season, you know, and then all the 15 seasons he did afterwards, they fired him from that show for talking about mexicans. Did you know that? That's when they fired him. They fired him from that show and he's still the executive producer. So he's talking shit about a show that he's still the executive producer of. How is he allowed to be a producer? He gets his fucking friends. I don't know all the rules about that, but I thought there were rules about that. He's probably going to step down now that he's president. I don't know. He said he was going to do a step down from a bunch of shit. Now that he's president,

Speaker 6:          01:15:59       it'll dude, it's going to be weird. Fucking for sure. It's going to be weird and he's going to be weird during the weirdest era ever. It's next friday, right? Yup. Twentieth. Soon as he gets into place. You think's going to happen that day. So paint the white house black house, you know, open up right in front. It's going to be like a river of lava. Does that the actual end of the world day? Yeah. The mayans were only off by four or five years. They were off by a little. What did they think? December 20. First 2012. So they were off. They were off a little four years. In a month. Yeah. Not that bad. Not that bad. They might sit a little bit. They did it thousands years ago, man. Few fucking guessing thousands of years ago. Me and I wonder if there really is like a cycle where a civilizations just, they, they get to a point where all the monkey shit that led them to scratch and scrape and dominate and procreate and get to a point where they have a city and finally get a little bit of safety.

Speaker 6:          01:17:05       All of that just bites it in the ass because all those, even though you've gotten past the monkey existence, all those monkey dna, human reward systems, they're all still in place and they still make you want to chase the same shit that people chased thousands of years ago. Conquest and domination and control the food supply and now that I'm president, I'll have all the gold that need for competition. That's going to be one of the things that I think technology is probably going to neutralize first. I think that when You get, when you get a hive mind type scenario, which is a hive mind or a virtual virtual worlds scenario where it's literally preferable to this world, like why would you want to hang around and just go to west hills and get lunch at some shitty place and wait in this thing and then go to the movie. Why would you even want to do that? When you get all your food through an ivy and you're going to live in the avatar world for a couple of weeks,

Speaker 6:          01:18:15       lot of people would do it. Dude. Damn food would probably be the only problem, like food and taking a shit. There's not a black mirror episode. You just started saying it had another time. It's happened from time to time. Like you just start going down a concept and it's like that's a black mirror episode. Original fuck. Yeah. what can I say? It was just an idea that you can go live in another, in another place that's going to happen that amount of time. What's the name of that episode? I want to watch it. San junipero I think is that one gonna happen man. It's just a matter of time and when it does happen, it might be a complete mental experience. Like you might get out of this and you might be like those poor guys who come back after a space walks, you know those guys at are up there.

Speaker 6:          01:18:58       LIke I'm a hatfield commander hatfield. I had him on the podcast and he was describing after being. I think he was up for six months. I think so yeah. It was a long fucking time and when he came back down like his body's brittle takes like a year for your bone density to come back. Like you're, you're a mess. You can't stand. He's throwing up all over the place, your whole body. So baffled because you've been up in space for six months. Like those guys make a tremendous sacrifice so that we can understand like what happens to people's bodies and zero gravity,

Speaker 6:          01:19:35       like all these people that are signing up to go to mars and want to go on all these journeys and space like settle the fuck down. Okay. We might be able to go to better spots and we just stay right here. We need to put a, a, a roof on this thing. We got rocks flying in. Need to put a god damn roof on the planet. Build that first big ass thick roof with lcd screens. So at the bottom of it, It just shows nothing but beautiful skies. Everywhere you go, it's going to be like

Speaker 3:          01:20:08       the truman show and there's gonna be a big scoop that catches all the rain. The rain is going to fall on the outside, it's going to get funneled through, but we need like a four foot wall now. It wouldn't even matter. The the, the kind of asteroids that killed the dinosaurs. I think they said something crazy like it was five miles deep into the earth within the first half. A second. Yeah. I might've made those numbers up, but it's in that range where it's so preposterous. I rememBer hearing this guy speak about it and talking about just the. The impact that the earth rang for a million years.

Speaker 7:          01:20:48       Bob

Speaker 3:          01:20:52       rang from the impact for a million years out. What the fuck is that like so we can't really have a. We need something better than a roof. That's what I'm trying to say. Work on that first and you got damn virtual reality. Then think about going to mars. I was listening to richard dawkins talk to sam harris today on this podcast. Very interesting, but one of the things that we're talking about is people going to mars and if they did colonize mars, the genes on mars would not be in contact with the jeans back here on earth and would human beings go off in different directions and then on top of that genetic manipulation once genetic manipulation gets perfected and they start really fucking with people's dna and really changing what people look like and what, how they can perform and how their Brains work was going to be like in comparison, like the guys that are doing tHat on earth versus the people that are doing it on mars.

Speaker 4:          01:21:49       Yeah, that's weird. I ended. The atmosphere is obviously different in general because of the way it's really grow and just be different. He can't breathe it. You have to somehow or another they're going to have to terraform,

Speaker 3:          01:22:04       create an atmosphere or um, they're gonna have to put some kind of a like domes up and live inside the domes, which is terrifying.

Speaker 4:          01:22:14       What is that kai? I feel like, was it an interstellar where they made. We didn't like, we call it, we didn't colonize planets, but we've made life floating terraform cylinders and we lived on those. Is that what that was?

Speaker 3:          01:22:29       I didn't watch that whole movie. I got to most mostly did that movie and I fell asleep on a plane.

Speaker 4:          01:22:36       So you didn't see the end and seeing that movie at the chinese theater was where I saw it done in hollywood when he goes and they go into the black hole and I remember even reading, that's where Christopher Nolan was t test watching that movie. It was so loud. So big. It made that such an awesome experience. Chinese theaters I'd love. I love to see it makes bad movies. Good.

Speaker 3:          01:22:57       Yeah. I saw pulp fiction. There was like, holy shit. That was when pulp fiction first came out and this was like 90 or something.

Speaker 2:          01:23:06       Yeah, man, I didn't see that movie, but that matt damon movie the martian was all about terraforming and trying to survive on mars. Did you watch the arrival yet? I must have watched that. No, no, I haven't seen. It hurts really good though. it looks really good, but that kind of came and went, huh? I mean kind of events that just how it goes now. There's too fast. Things are too good. Too much that people want to watch them at home now. Yeah. That too. They're going to start allowing that to happen I think are charged with more. Yeah. Charging 50 bucks. Yeah. Nobody's figured out how to get through the uh, well maybe they have get through the apple tv and downloaded. Have they like to steal from that? I don't think so. You don't like to steal from that? So just ask. I'm assuming you mean steal from them? Yeah. Yeah. I don't think so. I don't know. I don't think anybody's been able to do that. Maybe they have, but like when you're streaming, like you're streaming, I guess if you were streaming to a computer, that might be a way to do it. A screen capture and some sort of way.

Speaker 5:          01:24:05       Maybe. Maybe not. I don't know because they have it built into the. Well, I guess it's streaming a lot of the htmi cable is now, uh, if you're, when you have your xbox or your, another system hooked up to something that you're trying to do game capturing onto like Broadcast on twitch or something. If you bring up a video or like your tv turns on it goes black because it knows that that signal is bad. It's not supposed to be broadcast. It's not tHe game signal at the tv signal and you'll probably people's trying to show tv online, it knows that you're trying to or whatever. They put the dispute that stop in there.

Speaker 2:          01:24:38       Right. Exactly. Be removed. Right. Or maybe maybe. But I feel like there's gotta be a way to take apple. Like when you're using your computer, you can use a regular computer and watch things on itunes, correct?

Speaker 5:          01:24:52       Yes.

Speaker 2:          01:24:54       Right. So if you were using a regular computer and you were streaming a movie, like there's gotta be a way that you would be able to screen capture that with your computer. Oh yeah, for sure. But just open up a program. You mean record? Just record it. Yeah. Yeah. And then would have just some big ass file that would be like the hobbit or whatever the hell you were screened there. There's probably a way they can put in some sort of digital rights management thing that it will put brian record to that or it'll put of big watermark on if you try to do that or maybe not. And then someone will hack away to against it and that that's like a battle probably going onto the battle that will go on forever, right? Yeah. I'll just make a new file format and then

Speaker 5:          01:25:33       videos will be in that file format for the next five years until it gets hacked.

Speaker 2:          01:25:38       Keep playing cat and mouse games. I think it's really interesting when we were looking at that video or the article rather about the people that we're transmitting ola and chow back and forth through the internet. And then think about this kind of stuff that you're talking about, like really high level digital management. He putting out four k are you streaming

Speaker 6:          01:26:04       movies and people are trying to steal it and you know, think about all the bit torrents and all the different files that are available online when it comes to all these movies and hollywood studios. Pen spend millions of dollars to make and then boom, a screeners online like moments before it's released and like this constant battle of technologies. It's just, it's really crazy because we could just sit here and like just show up at this ces. We don't have to participate at all. Show up every year. What you got now? One year. What do you got now? Can you, can you read my mind yet? Nope, not yet. I'll see you in a year. What about now? Will we can't read your mind but we can send you images. Okay. We'll see you in a year. Can you read my mind yet? he just keep going back. Like you don't have to do any work.

Speaker 6:          01:26:50       Like no one gets mad at us. It's not like the people in the village that had to go get the water. Like you drink water every day. You fuck, you never go and get water and they never asked you to get water. You just got to give them money and they'll just keep doing it. You just show up every week and they never go, what do I have here? What do you have for me? What do you have for me? If you want to see my mind reading machine, I got money. Not good enough. NoBody ever says that it now like you don't have to. You literally don't have to participate in it to enjoy the benefits of it. It's a rare thing.

Speaker 5:          01:27:22       Yeah. I was trying to think of a, like at the end of the car companies outside was showing some stuff, but it was super. It was like a call to the statue, but it was supposed to be an actual model of a car.

Speaker 6:          01:27:41       They called the car statue because it doesn't have a drive train in it.

Speaker 5:          01:27:45       There were people sitting in it. It was supposed to look like whatever a future thing was. But the girl that kept, uh, she was telling you what was going on and explaining things to you. She kept calling. She kept referring to the car as a statue. I thought that was weird because I think I've tried to show it to you before. We were lIke, does that. Is that real?

Speaker 6:          01:28:03       Is that legal ease? Yeah, that doesn't work then that when you call something a statue, you could say that it's a prototype, like this is what we hope it looks like in the future, but based on what like do you know what the imaGes. Do you have a. Can you pull it up? I was trying to remember who it was. I want to say is it seems like if you just call it a statue, you could just totally bullshit people. It doesn't have to have any basis in real engineering or anything. You can just say it's a statue and he could just have like a design concepts to it. Was it a concept as far as like a crazy technological

Speaker 5:          01:28:38       vehicle with that? I think that's what they were trying to show off the tech

Speaker 6:          01:28:42       inside. Yeah. Have you seen like what new cars are doing now where all their dashboards are all lcds. That's

Speaker 5:          01:28:49       what I was trying to get. That's what they were trying to show. I think a little bit was like this is what the new dashboard and everything's going to look like. Go ahead and sit in there. It's crazy. Whenever one of the bmw, I think it was an eight, they had it inside the event. There was long line for this, so 100 percent wasn't waiting, but you put on the, I think it was the microsoft surface with it, so I don't know why you would have this on while you're driving, but maybe in the future we'll be doing that and you're getting all sorts of extra information. Um, at least my, this is still just a prototype, so I don't know. You weren't driving down the street so I don't know what they're showing you. They're just blasting stuff in your face on what it might look like. Wow. I don't know what you would be wanting to see though also.

Speaker 6:          01:29:30       Well, it just seems like whatever, you know, whatever possibilities they have now, it's you, you, you just try to extrapolate. You try to add up the steps between now and fIve to 10 years from now. It's going to be really weird. Did you see the darpa, one of the darpa announcements that we're talking about? All the different. Well, it wasn't an announcement. There were, it was an interview they did with one of the guys. I tweeted it so you could find it on my twitter timeline, but they're essentially saying the new, uh, inventions over the next, uh, 12 months, we're just going to blow people's minds. So apparently they're working on some really heavy duty stuff when it comes to neural implants. Things along those lines, I think he was mentioning is darpa's biotech chief says 2017 will blow our minds. Air quotes the pentagon, pentagon is research and development division.

Speaker 6:          01:30:29       The creative force behind the internet. And gps retooled itself three years ago to create a new office dedicated to unraveling biology's engineering secrets. The new biological technologies office has a mission to harness the power of biological systems and design new defense technology. They're gonna make terminators right over the past year with a budget of about $296 million dollars. It has been exploring challenges including memory improvement, human machine symbiosis and speeding up disease detection and response. Fuck dude. Listen to what that says. Human machine symbiosis there making up fucking terminator. They're gunna make a terminator 100 percent. If someone comes along and one of the first pieces of artificial intelligence is a soldier of machine soldier that makes no mistakes, feels no emotion, does everything. It's told consent back data in four k in real time and you watch a screen through its eyes and tell what to do and it's invincible. What? Of course they're going to build that. Why would we just send those to mars? We would probably, but people want to go to mars because they want to be the first. You know here we're doing yoga and maurice were all amazing.

Speaker 5:          01:31:50       Like I saw a couple of those, a unit, they're not brand new but like a robot assistance essentially where it's like a a laptop or an ipad screen that's attached to a droid or a little robot and there's someone on there talking to answer your questions or whatever and they can control it. Moving arounD the room. Have you ever seen those? No, I've walked. I kind of just walked by and I thought it was funny because there was three of them people were talking to and there's just one guy no one was talking to and he just looked bored. Like moving around like someone talking about someone talk to me.

Speaker 6:          01:32:20       What was the most impressive thing for you at the event?

Speaker 5:          01:32:23       Man? Honestly, that I'd have to. It was weird. I probably just because I was looking for, but that camera, that three d stereoscopic camera, three 60 camera, but again, I'm not sure if what I was seeing was the rendered video because that's specifically what I kept asking to see when I would walk up to one of these guys. I didn't want to. I don't, I don't want to be pitched. I just want to see what your rendered video looks like. What does the output. MosT of what I was seeing wasn't great or didn't look better than what's currently on the market except for that. And then a couple of didn't even do audio or you couldn't mix audio into it. And for our purpose, which is I was looking for it to help here in the future. I was trying to knock that out. Um, there were a couple of car things. Mostly just the bmw 7:50, the coolest one. They were showing those off there. They're also doing test drives with like [inaudible] and I think some of the self driving cars maybe

Speaker 6:          01:33:16       I think the sevenfifty drives itself to. I think that's the big one that does, but I believe it makes you put your hand on the wheel, but it'll drive, which is even freakier like imagines driving for you. But the idea is like if it fucks up, but what am I doing then why does my hands here? I didn't see it.

Speaker 5:          01:33:32       right. I didn't take it on a test drive myself, but they had one sitting out that you could like get in and just kinda like sit in and whatnot with all the extra screens everywhere. But the backseat, which probably is, I don't, I probably just didn't know this. It's basically like a first class luxury seat like that. You could lift your feet up, stick on the back of the seat. There was a place for them to have massage or. yeah, it was insane. Yeah. They give you a back rub or massage. I don't know if it's a new hot technology right now or if some companies are very smart knowing people are walking around this event tired and need a massage, but the lines for massage chairs at ces were insane.

Speaker 6:          01:34:10       Well, think about this jamie. You run all the time. Yeah, I mean how many miles a week do you run?

Speaker 5:          01:34:15       Oh no, I haven't been doing it very often, but at my height probably 30, but maybe 10,

Speaker 6:          01:34:20       10 a week now what's going on with you now? I just kinda weight training instead of running. Oh, again, yoked, young. Jamie getting swole. My point is you're a very fit guy and you exercise on a regular basis, so for you to walk 25 miles, if that's a strain for you, imagine what it is for a bunch of these fatties. No fence, no need to fat. Shame. You know what, you are no big deal. You know, I mean it's, it's got to be really fucking hard. If you are really poorly fed, you know you're eating a bunch of shitty food and you're out of shape and you're overweight and you're walking around ces, geeked out of your mind on caffeine. Yeah, it's probably a good start for the new year. So you just keep that going. Walk 10 miles a day. Every day you'll. That way it'll peel off you find a hill unless you live in Iowa or you know, some flat spot.

Speaker 6:          01:35:10       Find a fucking hill. Walk up hills. It's hardest thing. Just got one right in front of my house. It's amazing. Two hundred yards up hill to take a backpack. Throw some fucking sandbags in the backpack. Walk up the hill and then get off the trail, like get off the trail and just walk up the hill hill like walk up the grass and the dirt. So it slides and you have to correct yourself. It's one of the best workouts you can do. I, I was in pretty fucking good shape the first time. Everyone hiking with steve rinella when we went hunting and just following him walking up hills. Did we die? It's the second time it's happened. It's the video still recording, but the stream is just Putting. So if, Do you think it'S um, the machine or is it the connection with youtube we don't know. Did you find, speaking of which, did you find any new a streaming solutions because right now for people don't know. We're using a tricaster setup and it's okay. It's really good for tHe most part, but it has fucked us in the ass at least three or four times. Pretty hard

Speaker 4:          01:36:11       there. There wasn't a lot of stuff because it's again that was the consumer show so there's not. Consumers aren't really out here streaming for four or five different devices at once and all that. But I did find a couple of things that were close that I don't know. There were upgrades of stuff we used to use

Speaker 6:          01:36:30       couple of years ago. Well If you think about how many episodes we have, what are we on? Like 880 episodes. Ninety six. Okay. There you go. Outside. Plus a little slight tension. Eight 96. So think about that. Eight hundred 96 episodes and it's shit out. How many times a day

Speaker 4:          01:36:50       knocked down to that? $400. So on here and just brush it out four or five times.

Speaker 6:          01:36:55       That's not good. One. One percent. That's not good. Yeah, It was not very good. It shouldn't at all. That's way. That's way too often. I mean maybe we're fucked up. Maybe we did something wrong. Maybe a. I don't know. Maybe our machine just got a weird bug to it. YeaH,

Speaker 4:          01:37:13       I dunno. I mean I reset it multiple times and I have problems. I do the protocol of update.

Speaker 6:          01:37:19       Do you think it's just because it's long term. You were doing these for hours and hours at a time and heats up. We do stressed the hell out of it. Yeah. If you think about like what we do and company. You know what my frIend justin I know was doing the action report. Same thing, right? Yeah. He was streaming for six hours at a time. I can,

Speaker 4:          01:37:36       yeah. I think every time I think that I find another comparison. It's like, well, they'll do just about as long justin. I don't remember having any problems with his system. Maybe we got a wHack system dude. It could have been when we went to lemans happened with cars from time to time. That could have just been some component in here that was bad that we've gotten around working with that now. It's just

Speaker 6:          01:37:56       not gonna work anymore. Cars are another interesting thing. Along the same lines when we were talking about earlier about technology is that it's reaching this point where like is way too much car for like what you need. Like they're putting out these cars. Right? Right. Out of gm, like they have this new camaro. Have you seen the camaro zl one?

Speaker 6:          01:38:15       It is. It's insane. I think it has fought. I don't know how many horsepower it has. Final, how many horsepower? It has. Fifty six, 58. jesus christ and it's got a corvette z o six engine in it with a supercharger. Wow. It's an unbelievable car. Like this is a zero to 60 sub four seconds. Zero to 60 car, massive, uh, all that. See that stuff in the front. That's all designed to keep the body down. All those aerodynamic little flares and stuff does design for downforce so that this thing can go fucking screaming up to like 200 miles an hour. It's crazy. You can just buy that in a store where you could go to the chevy dealership and buy one of the most competent sports cars ever created. Like that car. You remember those ferrari's from a few years ago? Like a three 60 mo, dana, or uh, you know the one after that?

Speaker 6:          01:39:15       Four or five slash eight. Those beautiful ferrari dad fucking car. We'll burry one of those things. I mean, into the dirt. Good. Suck my dick. Kiss my ass. America. Fuck yeah. Screaming the entire time I'm off. Fuck yeah. And it's $65,000. $70,000. Yeah. That car is american muscle at its finest plus technology because you know, real american muscles kind of loose and crazy real man. Like if you get like, if you bought a real 19, 69 mustang, mach one, I mean there are a gorgeous car. I mean it is a stunning piece of art, but if you had a drive it today, you would, uh, you would be terrified. You'd be thinking the entire time. like, oh my god, I'm driving a death machine. Like they're so bad in comparison to a brand new mustang. Like if you bought a brand new mustang gt, which I think you can get for $35,000 I think. I tHink a new mustang gts, like between 35 and $39,000. And they are way fast or handle way better than anything. Top of the line from the 19 seventies. Yeah. How much does this across to under 35. That's crazy. It's stunning car. That car is foreign and 20 horsepower. Four 30 4:35 crazy. That's a beast of a car for 35 grand. Sixteen miles a gallon. Twenty five and a highway.

Speaker 6:          01:40:49       You see what they've done by continuing ramp up to specs, ramp up the litter regular car that you buy from a dealership is equivalent to like one of the best cars ever just 10 years ago or 20 years ago. So the, the technology is so ahead of its time that you go back to 97 and you look at the cars that were like the top of the food chain back in [inaudible] 97. Like they didn't even compare.

Speaker 6:          01:41:17       There's just nothing like these things and they're going to keep doing it. The only thing that, like you, there was some cars from 97 that have some attributes that people like, like um, those old land cruisers. If you bought a land cruiser from toyota in [inaudible] 97, you essentially got an off road vehicle. They had two solid axle, solid front axle, solid rear axle. you could take those things and just drive up the side of a fucking mountain in it with the right tires. They were crazy beefy, like right out of the bat. And so people to this day, they take those cars and they jack them up and put bigger tires and wheels on them and they put corvette engines in them just because the configuration is so durable, like they don't really make too many.

Speaker 6:          01:42:03       I mean there's only a few companies that will make like a real car that you could actually take right now, just go dry like a jeep. Jeeps are perfect example. You can take a jeep kind of like right off the factory floor and drive to most places that most cars can't get to or at least drive to places that most cars can't get it too. But when you want to get further and further into it, they started doing all these crazy modifications to these things and make them so that they could literally just drive through the woods.

Speaker 2:          01:42:30       What do you Look up their fellow? Uh, I just remembered this bad ass supercar that I saw at ces. It was three d printed. Oh jesus. It's called the divergent, I think the company that makes, it's called divergent three d. And this is called the blade. Oh, do you sit in the middle, like a total bad ass? Oh, that needs to happen. I think the whole entire thing is three d printing shop. we're down to the tires.

Speaker 6:          01:42:52       That is just such a. That's like the alien from John Carpenter movie.

Speaker 2:          01:42:59       Not John Carpenter, ridley scott, ridley scott's alien. It's like if he drove a car like it was on his planet, look at that thing one seat. Someone would probably sit behind you to. I was trying to find the spec to see. I don't know how weird. I wasn't sure to either. They'll fit like was it a car that can drive if it's a or if they're just also add concept of showing like look, we can put these pieces out in three d printing because I saw a three d metal company, so a company I was printing stuff and metal it looks like at work. So

Speaker 6:          01:43:36       these cars today, man, it's, it's, it's really interesting because they're backed into this weird corner where how much better can they keep getting and how long before they're all automated because it seems like just a matter of time. It seems like just a few years from now, they're all gonna be automated.

Speaker 2:          01:43:52       That's what everyone. That's what a lot of the companies were showing off their automation. LIke mercedes, I think nissan, toyota and video. The video game card company was showing off a. I don't know exactly the, their software I think. Are there hardware that was being put into cars to show you how things are being read? like this is a car, this is a light, this is a person. Just like how it's being recognized and whatnot. I mean it's going to go. Mercedes was showing it and I think bmw gotten to a car wreck, but I don't think it was their autonomous car. That car.

Speaker 2:          01:44:30       And then Fair day we're looking at the camaro. Zl one folks who are just listening or. Yes, there's images of it online. You can go look at it. Had the fair dave. So what's a fair day? Because didn't, um, fisker have a new car too. They came back, right? The fisker karma. But I don't know if they were showing this at the event. So this is an electronic car with electronic car. That was being shown off there. They had a little issue with like their reverse while they were doing their demos, so like again, one of the problems that doesn't always that nothing goes perfect. I think they tried to announce this last year and they had some bigger issues so they ever seen an ad where the president of the company stands right in front of the volvo and it hits, it, hits him, sends him flying. It's like, wait, this has technology to avoid contact with humans and it just fucking runs him over. He went flying. That guy probably broke his hip on that. It's happened a few times where they've tried to do things. People will stand in front of it trying to show her husband was working for this company.

Speaker 2:          01:45:32       Here's the car though. Woo. So they're gonna. I don't know if they're going to do. Oh it up on the screen in the background like this is going to be like a big competitor to. Or tesla car. Like a tesla. Yeah, I think they're going to be on the market this year if not already. I think you can preorder him now. Not very good looking, kinda super sexy looking aT the problem. Very sexy. Look, that's problem. Oh, I like how they have the gangster doors though. They have suicide doors in the back. Yeah. A lot of them were doing suicide doors. The volkswagen had a suicide door. The doors went up. We got to. The door shuts itself to. How about you save fucking battery power and let me shut the door. What does that? Everybody wants to be like a spaceman door shut. She shutting. Shutting dave. How's it could shut the door. That doesn't look good. You guys had all this time to design this thing. He spent all this money and you made a fucking alexis mom car. Well that happened. I wanted to sort of ask you that. I think that was one question. So like, you know when they do a car show the show, let's say that they're going to do one this year, they'll show a car for 20 slash 20 and it's going to look super high concept. by the time it comes out it won't look that way

Speaker 6:          01:46:50       sometimes. Sometimes you're too well they, they, they smoothed out edges and make things cheaper to build and there's a lot of cars that start out in concept form and then when they get ultimately delivered, they're disappointing, you know, come out with a bunch of different things that they add to them that just turned out to be too expensive. Is that what it is? They're just try as the same kind of idea. They're just trying something or Thailand. The car company to like toyota, like say if someone comes up with a new. Toyota has thE most expensive car they sell the land cruiser, that big four wheel drive suv, that's their most expensive car. It's pretty expensive. It's like, I think you get one, they're all loaded. You only get them one way and they're like 90 something like $90,000. So if you're building something that's going to get more upscale than that, then it becomes a bit of an issue. RighT. Doesn't that make sense?

Speaker 6:          01:47:45       I accidentally, I was looking for toyota supercars as this came up in the toyota. Supra might be coming out again. Yeah, no, that's the question. Like will it look like this when it comes out? You're right. That's a perfect example. That's a concept car. I think it would probably look a lot like that because that looks awesome. I mean if they wanted to make some money, but like then all those angles and all that stuff. Is it more expensive? Is it less expensive? What know? What do we do about that wing? Has it deploys it mechanical? How much does that cost? You know, what kind of brakes are we using? Which kind of it it really. It gets into this weird area when it comes to these cars, but they also have to be stunning in terms of their ability because cars today are off the charts.

Speaker 6:          01:48:28       WhaT you could buy from a subaru wrx. Just one of those little subarus that has an insane little car, you know, and I don't think those are very expensive either. I think that's in like mustang gt range, right? Where it's like in the thirties, 32 to 35. I did. I'm pretty sure take that to 1970 and you will destroy any car on the road. There's nothing comes close to it. You would think you were from another fucking planet. If he took that on a race car race car track, you'd be blowing people away. They'd be like, what in the fuck is it? Just particular car companies are a lot of the newer cars getting harder to fix to where they have to be fixed at a death by the dealer. They all have to be fixed by the dealer. Everything is computer program now. They hAve minds, you know the computer programmer or the program rather than running the car runs a traction control system.

Speaker 6:          01:49:17       The lane change system of accident avoidance system. Some of them hit the brakes for you. Some of them alarms go off when you get close, so they've got sensors, they got cameras, so getting your car fixed at a local by a local guy somewhere and it's not happening anymore. Yeah, that's going to be phased out. It's going to be all dealerships. It's going to be like getting your computer fixed. I mean, it's really going to be like a super high tech computer with rubber and metal and all this jazz that connects it to the ground. That mk

Speaker 2:          01:49:48       market marquez, brownlee. Mark, I don't know how you say his name actually, but mkbhd on youtube. He got up at. I don't want to do it. Been here. Yeah. Mark has got a full lemon, but his. He had a tesla issues. We just got a new tesla and his drive train was locking up fixed and then he got it back and it got locked up again. Wrong dude to fuck a shitty car. He should have tested that one first. That will cost you some money, right? Yeah. That kind of gives really good reviews to his, um, his online reviews of technology or one of my favorites him, but him and louis from unbox therapy or my. There are two of mY favorites. Yeah man.

Speaker 6:          01:50:25       The, those things are not perfect, but nothing electronic is, is, you know, what are you going to do? Somebody fucks up. Somebody put it together wrong or some issues in the wiring. Who knows?

Speaker 2:          01:50:36       Part of why I'm not always super convinced when someone goes full like this is going to be, this is how it's going to be in the future. It's because we still, even today with all of this, the coolest shit we have, there are still major, major problems that haven't been fixed and I don't, I don't see full fixes for them. Like which ones do you think tesla? It's like if they're going to be fix that, they'll fix it 100 percent.

Speaker 6:          01:51:00       Just stop and thinK about how clunky computers were just a few years ago. You know, just when 1995 windows, 95 came along. Think about how clunky the oPerating system was. The blue screen of death, you know, I mean computers were crap, but it still happens all the time. Right? But not nearly as much as it did. Then think about how many computers operate, how many things all throughout your life and how rarely they crash. If they crashed one percent of the time, like the, you know, the tricaster, we get pissed, which we're spoiled little babies. Back then when you had windows 95, you had a backup things every 20 minutes he can fucking kid crashed at any moment. You're sticking in floppy drives and backing up files and stuff. True. It's better. It's better now. It's going to be better soon and with whatever the issues that they have with a tesla cars or maybe it's just one tesla. Just somebody fucked up. Maybe somebody just put a wire in that had a scratch and who knows what the fuck?

Speaker 2:          01:51:58       No, it was. I don't know anything. I don't know. I still feel like, I dunno. Maybe it's a senate senate scenic view of it.

Speaker 6:          01:52:03       I've had. Let me tell you this though. I've had two of those. Lexis, those big toyota land cruiser trucks, the lexus f, f five, 7:55, 7:50. No, five slash 76. Five 70. That's what it is. The big ass truck. They fucking never break like nothing goes wrong with them ever. I mean ever. Nothing goes wrong. They just every morning start it, drive it. Oh, it needs an oil. Bring it to the place. They put the oil and they check everything. EveryThing's great. See ya. Bye. no problems. I'll try by range rovers as a brand new range rover. It's got one headlight on fucking smoke coming out of the hood. Like what happened? Like what? What is the difference between a car that's like a super reliable car company like toyota and a car company. You know, like, like if you get a maserati, you get a maserati because it's beautiful. You don't get a maserati because you plan on driving to the fucking moon and he needed to stay together. It's not going to. It's just not. It sounds awesome. He started up blah blah blah blah blah blah. But if you get that car, you get in it because it's sexy. You're not getting it because it. It's well designed.

Speaker 5:          01:53:17       OKay. Yeah. I guess I didn't know how I want everything to be awesome. No, I think I just. It should have already happened sometimes. Like those kids in that lego movie, everything is awesome.

Speaker 6:          01:53:31       I didn't see it too. It's a cute movie. I saw it with my kids. My kids love the lego movies, but I enjoyed it. Like I genuinely enjoyed it. The lego movie was good.

Speaker 5:          01:53:40       I just saw a commercial for the newer one. I think it's got a batman not on all the warning look for. Okay,

Speaker 6:          01:53:47       okay. They're really well written. They're fun. I mean, you gotta you can't be waiting for things to be deep, deep. Jamie. Really, really tired of it. I'm a less deep every year for real. Like I something that ron white said when he was on the podcast, key blind and stay drunk. Like I'm paraphrasing, stay drug. You keep lying. I mean in some ways the best way to handle things just not go deep. The deeper you go. Like I feel like we're clinging to simplicity with the last of our fingernails. That's what I think and I think just sitting on your fucking back porch, smoking a cigar, drinking a glass of lemonade. I think that's a thing of the past and just a few decades I think we're going to enter into some super bizarre world that's like darpa is talking about symbiosis. Human computer symbiosis, mean people complain. Now the kids don't go outside their sit, sitting at home everyday playing x box. Just imagine what it's going to be like when we get to these really intense augmented and virtual reality spaces.

Speaker 5:          01:55:00       Are you scared? No, I just stopped caring. I think of that stuff about kids all the time. I don't have one side. I can't, uh, I don't, I don't see the day to day their interactions and how they're different to mine, but I just compare because my generation or where I'm, I just turned 34, But I just, I feel like I've just missed out on so many things. The year after I left high school, they all get a guy like tablet pcs for everyone. It's like literally the year after I left. And like you were tHe last. Yeah, it's good talking about you. Maybe

Speaker 6:          01:55:28       one day if you have kids. Yeah. My dad grew up, they didn't even have the tablet pcs in the class the year after he got out. That's when they came in. Whoa.

Speaker 5:          01:55:37       But it wouldn't, I don't know how things would've been different had we had them because whatever we know, we always had a of people would look back, like

Speaker 4:          01:55:44       if I could go back to high school now with everything I know, dominate and kill everything.

Speaker 6:          01:55:48       No, You do it and you wouldn't be nervous. That's why you would dominate. True. Yeah. But if some kid decided to kick your ass and still kick your ass, that would be disturbing.

Speaker 4:          01:55:57       But I didn't even mean it. Like on the whole, on the whole thing like that. I'm just going on specifically, uh, like a technology, a run. Like if you had, if I just took all my computer knowledge I have now and had an ipad when I was in high school and we could communicate with everyone throughout the whole high school all day anytime we wanted to. Whereas like we had to write and we were writing notes. I still have, I found a note from a girl in high school like not too long ago in a box. It's like, it's a literal note. Dear jamie. Yeah. Dumb shit. Oh, I missed your touch. Stupid questions of like what's so check here like that they might write notes still today. That might still be a thing. it probably is. I don't want to be that, but like the purpose of it isn't there anymore.

Speaker 4:          01:56:45       Yeah, it's way more text messages to notes. Yeah. So this is. And then a facetiming people. We couldn't. That wasn't even a possibility. We had to literally falling into call. Like if I, if, if I was in school with your kids, it'd be calling your house, be like, hey is so and so home. Can I talk to them? They'd go get them and then we get to talk for 20 or 30 minutes maybe. Yeah. When was the fIrst year we're skype came out and people started skyping probably within the last 10 years. There was an ease. There was light video communication back then, but it was terrible.

Speaker 6:          01:57:18       Well if that's one of the things that apple has nailed, having facetime and its operating system so you just automatic it automatically works, you know, you don't have to download anything, you have to go get skype. like if you have an android phone, do you have to download skype or does it come with your phone?

Speaker 4:          01:57:33       I don't know, but I think that they have a thing to.

Speaker 6:          01:57:37       They have an androId thing to that just like it. But what's fucked up is it doesn't communicate with the apple thing. right? Like you have to get in like everybody's got to come to.

Speaker 4:          01:57:46       Well there's new apps too. I mean you can do it through, you could do it through facebook now if there's a new one that's blowing up right now called house party, which you can have like eight people on and everyone can be having a video chat. Yeah.

Speaker 6:          01:57:56       So, buT that's an app that you have to download. Like should be just like a phone call should be like phone to phone. It should be phone to phone, coMmunication with android to apple. It seems silly to me that they go proprietary on that. Apple's got a bunch of really sneaky ways to keep you around. Man. That I message is one of them. Facetime is another. Um, uh, what is it when they, uh, airdrops airdrops another one for images? No compression sends it through bluetooth, so amazing for videos and pictures and stuff.

Speaker 4:          01:58:27       I don't want to say it's a problem isn't the right word, but that they are like the only record label basically write or record distribution play state control of it. That's kinda crazy to. It is well interesting too that

Speaker 2:          01:58:42       a lot of musicians complain about that. They're like, apple is the biggest music company in the world now. So strain of every transaction. Do they really are? I'm pretty sure. Well they when they definitely want everyone to answer, there's an answer and it's like, well now you're not necessarily happy with the answer, but yeah, you got one. It's A very weird company in that regard because it's also like the loyalest apple loyalists are so extreme, like people who worship at the cult of mac and apple, like I had a conversation with. The dude was sincerely bummed out that I started using a windows computer. It's like so sad. He was really sad. It's like, come on dude, it's fucking computer. Just a computer. Just relax. You know? I do. I type words. I'd say boards and I look at porn and I read dig. I read a few things.

Speaker 2:          01:59:34       It's not a lot of processing power going on here. I'm not making videos, it's not in it and I, I just don't understand why everybody would get so attached to a company, you know, so brand loyal, fingered real prep blend, brand loyalties. Real weird. This chevy country. Have you listened quietly? You'll hear for rust and so many dorks like that. Like they have calvin and hobbes like he's standing on the chevy logo, pissing on the ford logo. Magic put nine on your car. Mind you being that fucking stupid. If you're listening to this and you have that on your car, don't change. Stay yourself man. It's all right. Change if you want to, but don't worry about me. What else did you see there? Anything else worth discussing? How many, how long were you there for? One day. I got there friday, friday and saturday. And when did you feel the stomach flu coming on wednesday night.

Speaker 2:          02:00:36       Oh dude. FucK man. Power through. I was also kinda like wonder. I could have just been one of those 24 hour thing are. I was like, I feel like shit now. I feel great tomorrow, so I just went ahead and went. What was your stomach rumbling? The whole. Not the whole thing. I just flew in a coffin. Just felt weak and worn down kind of thing. Yeah, man, that makes you aPpreciate feeling healthy, doesn't it? Like when you. Are you feeling a little shitty right now, right? Yeah, for sure. It's not 100 percent, but you know that feeling where you're like, man, when I get healthy, I'm drinking fucking vegetable juice every day. I'm not fucking around anymore. I'm limitiNg myself to one glass of wine. No sugar, no this, no that. I'm going to take my probiotics. I'm doing yoga. Twice a week he started thinking of all the different ways you can keep yourself healthy and being in vegas isn't the best place to think about that too. Like the worst. it's the worst for your soul to your soul's tugged at the gambling. I wonder what they'll do there is because smoking is smoking weed path, right? So how do you think they might handle that they're in the Future? Well, they're going to have to handle the extreme paranoia. A bunch of stoners going

Speaker 6:          02:01:40       in there like, dude, I don't want to lose all my money. They're going to go into those casinos and they're gonna. Well, I think if I was running a casino, I would try to figure out a way to capitalize on the stoners. The Big money that they make apparently is those fucking huge disco places like haka song where they get those dj's to come in. YeaH. Somebody was telling us who the fuck was telling us about this, how much they get paid. Is it russell? Because russell, it might've been russell the other night because, you know, russell hates those electronic dj's because he's into like old school hip hop dj and he is a dj. Um, but when you, when you hear how much money people pay to get into those things, like some dudes are paying like 500 bucks each to get into those things.

Speaker 2:          02:02:25       More than that. How much more than that? I feel like a table. Oh, if you want to table it, that's something that needs to get it by the bottle for a couple of days and then paper had to get in and girls get in for free, but guys definitely don't. Well they were saying at a certain point in time, even girls were had to pay 150 bucKs if you go late probably. Yeah.

Speaker 6:          02:02:42       That's crazy money. I mean that is just swarming money and then there's all the alcohol money on toP of that. Those are probably the biggest generators of income other than crazy gambling guys that just come in and blow their whole. Their whole wad

Speaker 2:          02:02:57       a $100 to buy a ticket right now for this weekend if you it. That's pretty ahead though. But yeah that's ahead of time. Yeah, a hundred bucks.

Speaker 6:          02:03:08       Alright. Alright. Alright. Alright. Alright. Alright. Alright. Alright.

Speaker 2:          02:03:13       But they have open container laws. You're allowed to walk around all over vegas drinking. You can buy it anywhere you want. You can walk around and drink right in front of a cop. Well here's an interesting thing too.

Speaker 6:          02:03:24       It's sort of an unspoken thing, but those hock hassan places, all those places, there's booze flowing for sure, but there's also pills, a lot of those people in the mtma. How many of those people, what percentage? Like if you could light people up at the little thought light bulb popped up on their head. When you look down on the dance floor and all the different people that are on mtma, what is it? Like 30 percent? If you had to guess,

Speaker 2:          02:03:47       man, 30 percent is being very reasonable to go with at least 50, but I feel like that's even low.

Speaker 6:          02:03:54       Yeah. And it literally might be like 60 percent of the people on ecstasy. It's like, do you. Do you roll? Are you rolling? No, I don't roll. Wow. Crazy. Why are you here? And so if you a casino, okay. And you know that all these people were on ecstasy and you start counting all the pills start counting and we're missing out on $150,000 a night. And ecstasy sales.

Speaker 1:          02:04:27       Okay.

Speaker 6:          02:04:29       Who's selling the ecstasy? Who's the guy? Where's all that coming from? How's it getting in? Who's aware of this? I didn't have know. Do they have to know or does it all come from outside? Maybe it's all completely detached. Maybe they don't want to know. Maybe they know that they need the ecstasy in order to keep the business running because like, I don't know. See, here's the thing. These rooms where people just get together and dance with a guy on a turntable that's just sort of pressing play and also electronic music and lights. This is a Recent human phenomena. it's didn't exist 30, 40 years ago. People would. It was saturday night fever. Staying, staying alive. I mean, yeah, disco balls. That was like the best light show you got. Oh my god. The light goes off the ball. It's crazy. Now they're. They have laser shows.

Speaker 6:          02:05:21       The music is insane. You know it was. Confetti is getting shot through the air. These people have stayed. Shows the strobes like, look at this. Where's this look? I don't know. Random vegas partY. Dude, this is insane. I mean, they're just a visual splendor of it. All the, the led or lcd, well actually led rIght? Light emitting diode displays. It's crazy, I mean it's beautiful to look at and all these people have glow sticks like that. When you see glow sticks, those people were on ecstasy. Those people are fucked up. A lot of them, like a good percentage, like look at the size of that place. A concert that do in the summer called electronic daisy carnival. Jesus christ.

Speaker 5:          02:06:07       This is also in the middle of the summer when it's 150 degrees out there.

Speaker 6:          02:06:10       Um, how many people are just dropping dead sweat and their dicks off. They just caught him off and throw them in a hole in the desert.

Speaker 5:          02:06:16       This whole wall is in big led show. Wow. So like, I don't know if you're not what you're enJoying on there if you're not on mtma or.

Speaker 6:          02:06:25       Yeah, you would still enjoy it. We would, if we were high, we would enjoy The shit out of that. you go and smoke a bunch of weed and go and stand there.

Speaker 5:          02:06:32       Same people would pay the same price as they pay, pay for alcohol. They'd pay foR those for weed if they could smoke them and kind of

Speaker 6:          02:06:41       the problem with smoking in there as assholes would light people on fire, you know? I don't know if they would do to displace. RArely would you find me. You can even In a group full of peace minded hippies, you're going to find one or two dick wads and once a white someone's hair on fire, you know, dropping ashes on their hair or something like that. So you can't really do it. And that kind of environment. Well, wHen you're, when people are closed in together, like smoking's fucking dangerous. Not that dangerous. You know, you like, you thinking about burns to your face or at me, haven't you been burned by people? Yeah. Yeah. We all have like accidentally there cherry drops on you and you're like, what the fuck? And like your hands on fire. You don't know why. It's because some drunk is hovering over you with their cigarette while they're talking and it just drops on you.

Speaker 6:          02:07:23       That happens. I mean that's a minor thing. I mean, anytime you get a giant group of people together like that though, you run risks, if they could give away pot, see the problem with selling it, even if you're selling it as you're going to be responsible for all these people having heart attacks, if you give them edibles, like give them that goddamn spray that joey diaz just pumps it his mouth. like it's nothing. This stuff is so powerful. It's so powerful. Like it's psychedelic. It's very, it's very much like acid in a lot of ways. When you get a high dose of the, uh, the, uh, the sprays. And so if you were doing this experience on that mean if you could keep it together, it'd be wonderful. But a lot of people are going to get super paranoid and freak out and have panic attacks.

Speaker 6:          02:08:08       And so you don't, you're gonna want to sell them edibles. It's like it's too strong for most folks, especially people that don't regularly dabble in it. They won't know how much to take. It's not like booze. Like if someone gives you a shot, you take a shy, like holy shit. Like you feel it pretty quick, right? Someone gives you a couple shots. You're like, oh geez, I gotta stop. I've got to settle down. Or you go crazy, but you know what a shot does like a couple of sprays. This who the fuck knows what's going to happen? You don't know. You're taking a chance. Hey, eat this cookie. Okay. You don't know you're taking a chance. A cookie might be like a shot or it might be like a whole bottle of vodka, you know? It might be so much of a hit a, you're paralyzed and you just want to lay in a fetal position on the ground.

Speaker 6:          02:08:53       So anytime you get a giant group of people like this, alcohol is like the safest bet. If you're going to sell it to them. Everybody has how to deal with alcohol, where they deal with it poorly or not. You kind of know the numbers, you know, oh, I had five beers. Do don't drive. You're fucked up. You know? Oh, I had one shot while you're a 350 pounds, you probably barely feel it. You know what I mean? Like we all know what the tolerances are. It's pretty. It's pretty universally acknowledged. I'd love that. A place like this exists though, man, that these kids can get together and just go fucking bananas because you can make some life decisions in these kinds of rooms. You could decide where you're gonna, how you're gonna live your life for real, because if you work everyday like Joe Smith on that fucking construction site and you show up even with your gold wbc belt and everyday is hammering nails and picking up wood and thinking of the time you have off.

Speaker 6:          02:09:44       Sometimes you can go to a place like this and you just experienced joy and laughter and fun and partying, and you start to think about your job job, your real job, and you start to dread it. You start to really dread It. You start to really get sick and you start to think about all these people that are putting on these electronic carnivals. Why can't I do that? Or you think about something else you do. I got to make a living making furniture. I love making furniture. I fucking loved designing it. I've got to figure out a way to open up a shop and then maybe something like this. She's these, these moments when you're away from the grind and you're just in this fantasy land and you hear it and everyone's on ecstasy and people are walking by touching everybody's chest and everybody's laughing and you just realize like, this is A. This is all temporary.

Speaker 6:          02:10:35       This whole experience is temporary and I'm wasting so much of my temporary time doing bullshit that I don't want to do. Everybody tells you what law I want you to take over the faMily plumbing business. I don't want to plumb. I don't want to clean out anybody's broken shitter. I want to make those led lights that, that turned into floatinG mushrooms. I want to make those. Somebody has to make that. That's a job. I have to figure out how to get that job. That would be the shit. I mean, all these people that we have to rely on and we keep the, you know, go to ces every year. All those people that you have to rely on, like all those people pretty much had to take a chance. All oF them, pretty much everybody that's doing any of those things where they're putting out these new technologies and showing all this new inventions, all of them had to be like disenfranchise or disenchanted with something and just got to take a chance. This is what I want to do and then this is what I'm going to pursue.

Speaker 4:          02:11:32       What else did you find that? Anything else? Because we've got to wrap this up soon. I think that was honestly, I didn't see tons of stuff that was blowing my mind this year. I saw a couple of cool things. What was the phone? Oh, that phone. Yeah. So the interesting thing about it, I'll try it. I even had a little bit of my tomato weiwei. Weiwei? Yeah. What's, why way? What's, uh, is it an android phone? Oh yeah. It does run android thing. This is it right there. yep. Why way? Who makes a weiwei? that's the company. The phone was called like a mate mate nine. I think it's the model of their phone.

Speaker 4:          02:12:11       I was asking this guy question about it because it. What it does is it has a really good lens on it or two lenses actually, and so it's doing this thing called aperture and I forget what it was actually calling out, so I'm hitting this button here and trying to see what it was going on. So I was trying to figure out if it's actually doing lens blur, which is what a lot of people were always after when they're taking pictures they want really good blur, photo look good. Which is what that portrait mode and the new iphone, it's kind of all about. So it keeps the foreground in focus in the background becomes blurry, like a real camera. So I was just asking if it was actually doing it or if it was simulating it using software and what he say. I'm pretty sure he was telling me that it was stimulating using software. That's why he was hitting that button. That's what I kept putting my hand in front of it to kind of see what was going on.

Speaker 6:          02:12:56       So the cool thing about the iphone is it uses hardware doing that, right?

Speaker 4:          02:13:00       Yeah, it's, it's using the toolkit as far as I know. And then again it could be doing some other stuff. It's not the same as me grabbing my dslr camera and having a really good lens and frame the focus point and all that. It's not the exact same as that.

Speaker 6:          02:13:11       So when you, if you did That with a camera, you'd be able to tell the difference in the quality of the image.

Speaker 4:          02:13:16       That's sorta what I was going. I was like, I kind of should be able to tell. I feel like just by looking at it, if it's real or not, it didn't look real to me. It could've just been a trick and I might not have been. I might've just been looking at something I didn't, I think I was seeing. But uh, what are these kids playing here? What's three d games?

Speaker 5:          02:13:32       East sports. So this is the intel booth. They're doing a little bit of a there. This is what an ea sports game situation might look like in the future because this is going, there's a tbs is broadcasting a lot of east sports or some other company's investing a lot in it.

Speaker 2:          02:13:46       How come they don't play those games on ergonomic chairs like these, these are ergo depot chairs. He desert, those are ergonomic sort of like race car chairs, but racecar chairs you sit back. See when you play a game, you lean forward just like you use a computer.

Speaker 5:          02:14:02       Some, some people do, most people obviously are leaning for, but they also have extra pads and um, so like have your back in certain spots. But what, what's going on here as a, on the screen above them, this is a, their gameplay is being rendered above their head so that you can be viewing this in three d space. So if you had a vr headset onto, you'll be viewing these situations all differently in the future. It's kind of just flows like a concept. I'm pretty sure they were showing.

Speaker 2:          02:14:26       Do these chairs we use are so good. I look at other. Everybody's sitting in other chairs. I'm like, you poor bitch. These ergonomic capisce co chairs. Um, do those have haptic feedback or sound to come out of them that know those chairs don't really or anything. I'm still doing that window thing. Huh? Where they have the window in the side of the computer. We look in that one I was trying to show here. It has some e ink display going on, which you can't. You could see it moving a little bit. Oh whoa. Oh, that's dope. So it just looks cool. Yeah, it just looks cool. Yeah. Well they've by having all these different companies making pcs, they opened themselves up to so much weird innovations.

Speaker 5:          02:15:04       One real cool thing, and again this is one of those things, I'm not sure if this is real or not. This is called a tiny most camera. What they're saying this camera does. It's made specifically for shooting outdoor astronomy photos. It's got google, the google star maps built into it. And the reason I don't, I'm not sure on this because I've tried personally to take photos of stars and the moon in different things in the sky at night. It's a really hard to do and like for for one, if you're trying to take a picture of what they have done here, which would be like the galaxy where you can see the different gasses and whatnot. You have to leave your aperture open for a long time, a couple of seconds and let the light get in there. The opposite of that, if you're trying to take a picture of the moon and get detailed picture of the moon, you got to go really quick because there's so much light coming off of it.

Speaker 5:          02:15:51       You have to get this assistance. Snap second. You have to have really good lens and whatnot. This camera is good for both and it's about the same size as a point and shoot camera and it says that they're allowing you to take all the and I don't know exactly how because I couldn't take this outside myself and play with it. WhAt do they say when you asked them to describe how it works? I. I didn't ask. I heard this guy giving a description to somebody else. They didn't really give a great. This is all the data and this is how everything is a, this is how it actually works. They have some, they have a software which said it was like a patent pending on some noise reduction filters, which would be reducing noise on your photo and sort post after the fact, which I don't know if that's, if it's tricking it or if it's just removing some of the data from your picture to make it look like a better picture, but it was being advertised on lots of different outlets as this is maybe they actually got hands on and I didn't and they got to see that it was proven so

Speaker 6:          02:16:46       well. It'd be really interesting if it was true. If you could just point a camera up and take a picture of the galaxy, that would be the shit, but you would have to have no light pollution. Correct? I mean it's not. No way. I would see through the law. You'd have to go somewhere, right? Oh my god. What is this thing?

Speaker 5:          02:17:00       So this is another like vr. The skies flying around in space.

Speaker 6:          02:17:04       This is insane. You were looking at this guy leaning forward, he's got his forearms and his hands connected to this. These two handles on the front and the back. His feet are strapped into this thing, so he's kind of planking the whole time. It doesn't look good if there's anything on his stomach, is that correct or is there something on his stomach?

Speaker 5:          02:17:22       I don't think so. So I think that's hard to do, man. It doesn't look. It didn't look like the most comfortable thing.

Speaker 6:          02:17:29       Yeah. See he's leaning on his forearms and he's, he, he's steering himself with his own body weight. Well that would be a fucking vicious workout man.

Speaker 5:          02:17:38       When you're flying. I don't think he'd be laying on something really eat unless you were flying on like a carpet or. You know what I mean?

Speaker 6:          02:17:44       Well you still like. It's like his body is not subject to gravity, but his stomach, his body's being pulled down. So you'd have to liKe really develop your. I've bet a lot of people gonna hurt their back on that because like you're going to do it and you're going to strap yourself into that thing and you're going to get to a point where you're too exhausted to keep planking

Speaker 5:          02:18:03       or what it says up here in the corner underneath their little banner that says it's good for exercise your core and your upper body and all that.

Speaker 6:          02:18:09       Oh dude, people are going to be bulletproof. They keep doing that. Like if that's going to be one of those dance, dance revolution type things where people start doing it and they get in shaped because of it because like this looks really hard to do. You remember that thing that we had on the podcast that we reviewed that frog. You remember the frog, brent? I believe shop was telling us about it, but it's a a weight thing that you do. Will you move your body forward and backward? Yes. It's like a. Do you know what I'm talking about? And you actually move forward and backward with it. I think it's called the frog, but it looks remarkably similar to that thing. So imagine if you have a game where you put virtual reality headsets on and you do that frog workout thing. You can't find it.

Speaker 6:          02:19:02       Give it a try. I typed in frog and it's just given me pictures of frogs lifting weights and stuff. What about frog? Weightlifting equipment? The frog. The bull frog? No. Is that it? What it is, folks is you know that the way a frog looks when it's moving across water, when it has those kicks with its back legs and it's four legs and they come together and then they go apart. Frog fitness. There it is. And this thing is this weird. It's got wheels in the front and wheels on the back and you connect your feet to the base of it and your upper body to the front of it. SkuchA heads. We could see these guys doing this. You look, I got a football, but it's a serious piece of workout. See here you see this guy moving with this thing back and forth and back and forth, and uh, I think you can change the resistance in those cables. You can make it more difficult to do and apparently it gets you in sick shape. I've heard a lot of people talking about this thing saying it's a tremendous piece of a strength and conditioning equipment by open. Yeah, it's 1:30. All right. We'll bring in hunter mott's. That'll be a podcast too. But imagine doing this with like handles virtual reality and you're doing a game. I mean these guys are crawling along with this thing.

Speaker 6:          02:20:23       Imagine if you're doing this, but you think you're flying a spaceship and you're shooting shit. We need to Just need to get virtual reality in a bigger Spaces so we can be moving around and be playing with each other. I think that's a big, big gap. We need still to, to be fixed. Yeah. Football fields. Yeah. Virtual reality on football fields. We also don't want to be. We need to not bike. If we both have on headsets, I don't want to bump into you. Yes, that's big. I figured that next step to interesting stuff. Young Jamie. All right, we'll be right back with hunter mott's.
