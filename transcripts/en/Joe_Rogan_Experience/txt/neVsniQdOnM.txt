Speaker 1:          00:00:08       Yeah, what's up man? How you didn't see it? Like why? I have never seen a single, a silly statement like I could kill a wolf so much fucking night. The people are so excited about this. It's the weirdest thing I've ever seen, man. I can't, I can't call it. It was just tweet random shit all the time and that just for some reason that uh, everybody had an opinion on it. That's a weird one, man. It's funny though. I've seen a lot of people tweet really ridiculous shit, but I don't think I've ever seen anything get this much speculation, discussion, debate. People are mad at you if have pissed off. Like, fuck you. You can't, can't be wolf. Jesus Christ, Bro.

Speaker 1:          00:00:52       Yeah, it is a weird thing, man. It's a weird thing. The social media today. It must, you know what it's. I think it is. I think you said it at a time where people were looking for some shit to argue that has nothing to do with trump. Nothing to do with climate change. It's like, oh, we got something here. I'm glad I can be that source of a distressed containment. Yeah, it does seem like that though, doesn't it? It's like you caught like, I think it's like peaks and waves because if you did this the day nine slash 11 happened, nobody, nobody would give a shit. They probably don't. Uh, you don't respect it. Probably be like, yeah, exactly, but can't believe you're doing this on that day. Some people would probably, if you did it today, they'd be like, I can't believe you said that on national woman's day, Bro.

Speaker 1:          00:01:37       National Woman's Day. You to talk about fighting wolf. What's wrong with men? He says, what's wrong with patriarchy? I can't call it man. That's it. It was interesting though. My mom called him his sylaria man. People ain't talking to for years. I can't be the wolf. I don't know man. I don't know. So do you always just tweet random shit man? Just randomly, just whatever's on my mind. I'm pretty active on there. Was that. So twitter is supposed to be. It's a great platform, man. It's better. It's one of the, I think is the best social media platform. Yeah. Well it keeps people from Ramblin. Well it is. So it's a, it's a, an extended ramble. Yeah. Well you can, you know, you can go on those little one, two, three, fours where people like to. Okay. But what I'm saying is like if you read people's facebooks, people get so verbose on facebook.

Speaker 1:          00:02:28       I can't do it. I haven't been on facebook for awhile and the reason why I decided to get off with my grandma requested me so lucy maze. Shout out to Lucy. She's like, Lucy, major question your friend. I was like, I can't, I can't be on facebook. Right? Facebook. Grandma's not on twitter too. Not on twitter. Know some people that did not in the public guy. They don't know what to do with twitter. Like, what do I do with this? Exactly. One of my boys just got on. Matter of fact, he just got a smartphone actually and he just got

Speaker 2:          00:03:00       a smartphone. Don't have to loop man. And so he. So he gets on twitter and he's like, so what do I, what do I do? Tweet man said, well what do I say? Whatever you want to say, man. It's like, it's hard to. I guess it'd be hard to gain a following from scratch, like let's, you know, a lot of people or you have a platform, so you gotta say something fucked up and then someone's gonna retweet that and then people start following you. I've seen people do that. I think that's where, that's where trolling started. Oh yeah, for sure. Being in an audience and just trying to Piss people off. So trolling this word weird. It's like I wonder how many. I wonder who has the most fake accounts. Like there's gotta be some dude out there that has like a record number, like 150 fake accounts.

Speaker 2:          00:03:37       Just trolls. People I don't understand. Like, well that's because you're a successful man with an actual life. It's, I mean, that's true. I appreciate that man. Says a lot coming from you. But uh, I don't know man. It's just weird, like your whole, like a Internet existence is just to piss people off. I guess it was humans like that in real life anyway. So. Oh the definitely is. It makes sense. Yeah, that definitely is. But it's a new thing, you know, the ability to do it without seeing the person and being in contact with them physically to be on the other side of the planet. Yeah. Matter of fact, I saw a documentary you were on that you, you described it beautifully about how when we first got on the Internet and it was that aol dial up and everybody just kind of mumbling around.

Speaker 2:          00:04:21       Everybody's just kind of bumping into each other and then slowly finding a way to interweave it into our existence. It was a Dopa analogy that you put up. Well, we're in a weird stage right now, or it's gonna suck. I don't know what it is, what's coming next. But whatever's coming next is going to be way more invasive than this. It's got to be an man probably. Jamie's got some goofy glasses. He's got on check these bitches up. He's got these snapchat glasses, map check. They have light bulbs in the eye, like, look when you're filming as cold, look at that so you can actually can actually snapchat from them.

Speaker 2:          00:04:59       Go to my phone and then I put it up like I don't have to put all of them up and it's not going on. Wow. This, see, this is just stage one. Eventually it's going to be live all the time. Contacts. Right. Put it in context. That'd be cold. That's definitely gonna happen. It's definitely gonna happen now. When you, when you said that shit about wolves, how serious were you? We have serious fucking around. Well it's had fucking around, but it's like when you started thinking about it and breaking it down, I really, I felt like I can't, but everybody thinks I'm talking about lay everybody, especially on twitter, like they're posting these big ass wolves with 200 pound plus wolves. I'm like, all right, listen. Like those are rare. Right? Right. I'm not the biggest human on earth. And you go get me a picture of the biggest wolf. You can find some fair. It's not fair. Right? So Google average wolf size and I feel like if it was, you know, my life was dependent on it. Like you have to think like that. Right? If you want it to a wolf

Speaker 1:          00:05:58       and he's threatening you and you'd like, I can't get him, but you did so well. I feel like if you had something on you, you'd have more of a chance. I would have sort a knife or something. I feel like I wouldn't be in the woods without something. But wolves. Van, do you know how hard they bite? Yeah, no, I've done research. I've done a little research. Um, I think it's like 1200, five times stronger than a pit bull. Right? I think it's 2,500. I think it's 2,500 pounds per square inch. See if he could find. I was looking yesterday. Yeah, I think it up a mastiff was stronger than a wolf, which is weird. It wasn't, it wasn't even top five. Fucking dog alligators and crocodiles were stronger than that. A gorilla was stronger. The grills bites from you. Wow. I would've never imagined herbalism.

Speaker 1:          00:06:43       Yeah. They're eating Broccoli and shit. Strong branches. Well, they just have to fight other gorillas for pussy because they have a one inch Dick and they control a bunch of chicks. I have to have a good bite. How do you know that they have it? Is that I know a lot of shit about girls was a little tiny segment. Well, it's about uh, whether or not the females are promiscuous. See when, uh, when you look at like it's, it's, it's actually a truth with humans too. But testicular size and Dick size is directly correlated to the amount of promiscuous females around. Really? Yeah. So if you're around a bunch of hoes, your balls get bigger. That's interesting. What is the evolutionary advantage? Like? Well, you got to, you got a sling as much dick as you can because these bitches are just running around with every button.

Speaker 1:          00:07:29       I don't. National Women's Day, Bro. No, I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. So sorry. You're right. I apologize. So thoughtless of me. But that's, that's why chimps have big dicks and chimps have giant balls. Ever. See Chimp balls? Never seen a chimp chipboard. Pull up some chip balls. There's a picture of this hairless chip who sit in there and he has balls to just kick it back to juicy, right? Payers like to Georgia peaches. So he goes balls. Wow. Good. Assize is fucking balls. So like he's so big. He's so jacked. That's what chimps look like when you take the hair off of them as crazy. And that's the only 150 pounds. So they have a shave. This chimp? No, he has mange. Okay. See all his hands. Like he's got the skin condition over his hands and shit. The animals a lot about. Well here's what need even crazier one.

Speaker 1:          00:08:20       Pull up this picture. Jamie. Direct correlation between testicle size and brain size and chimps versus humans. Yeah. See that's a human. That's a chimp brain on the, on the top and a chimp ball on the bottom. And what's the correlation? Well, they have giant balls and little brains. If our balls were as big as our brains, we would have a fucking serious problem. First of all, we wouldn't be able to walk that. We would have to figure out some sort of a harness. I feel like my boss will be bigger though balls would be really in chimps than not know that'd be a bigger than they are now. If what if we had smaller brains? Yeah, probably. Yeah, probably. I guess. Yeah. What they think is that went with chimps, especially because chimps are seriously promiscuous, like there's no monogamy and the chimp world. Good for challenges.

Speaker 1:          00:09:12       Fuck everybody. Good for getting it everywhere. We still holding on barely. We say, well hold it on, but it's like 50 percent divorce rate is high man. Yeah. Which means 50 percent divorce rate and out of the people that are not divorced, how many of those people are living in fucking abject misery? Just constantly being beaten down by life and not, not being happy. I sent old. Uh, it's an old customer for sure. It's definitely an old customer. There's an old quote from thoreau that most men live lives of quiet desperation. That's really my favorite is a Chris Rock. He said, uh, he said a man is only as faithful as his options. Yeah, that's a good quote to the, uh, the chimp thing though. What's interesting about it is that gorillas have figured out a way to hold it down. Like gorillas keep all those women like faithful, all female.

Speaker 1:          00:10:06       So he's a polygamous gorillas. Okay, well he has a bunch of women. He has a Harem, but the women don't fuck around with any other males other than him. So He's got this little dick ass and not big balls either. Gorillas are Mormons. I didn't know. Just giant, you know. So they're giant and they have giant muscles, giant faces, giant jaws. And they could kill other gorillas, you know, by biting them and tearing them apart and shit. But that's the only thing they use their mouse for interested in branches and Shit and leaves. I don't know why, uh, they need that strong jodie fight off all the other gorillas but a strong, super strong. But so other grills, I'm always interested in the, the, like the evolutionary reason as to why things are the way they are. Yeah, it's fast. And so it's like, it's their first instinct to bite, you know what I mean?

Speaker 1:          00:10:54       Cause ours, ours isn't. I think they show their teeth more than they bite, you know, they show the teeth, they beat on each other. Intimidation. Yeah. Because I've seen videos of gorillas beating the shit out of each other. This. Oh yeah. This is one recently, right? This is one at the zoo. These two girls go at it. It's like food bags. Yeah. And a big gorilla was like about 500 pounds. Right. And a big one of these dudes just start circling each other. But this is just because they're assholes. Whoever built this gym, you're not supposed to have two silverbacks together. Yeah. So most of what they're doing is just like, it's all for me to go to zoos anyway, man. It's depressing. It's a prison, you know, it's not depressing. Note, I always say this, the giraffe cage, those drafts don't get seen me.

Speaker 1:          00:11:36       Give a fuck was just so chill. I used to. I had had a bit about it. And when you need to go so slow, but they don't. There's no one's eating them. They're happy. That's all they want to do is just eat and chill. I did see a wild lines get after one once. Oh, in real life. You know the, on the Internet. I'll tell you one safari or something. Nah, hell no. I went on safari and they saw, they saw some lines out. I think it got a Gimsburg or something like that, but they said it was crazy. And so the female lions chase after this thing and then they were there right when it took it down. That's crazy nature of scary place, man. Yeah, that's why I'm surprised you think you could take a wolf. Well, I'm not, I'm not out here trying to hunt.

Speaker 1:          00:12:15       Well, I'm just saying in the event if I catch you avid, like you look at like a grey wolf, right? They're small compared to me. Well they just shot one of was 182 pounds in Minnesota. She, that was a bit. Yeah, everybody gave me that picture. Sizable fucking bear. That's something that was a big, big wolf. So if like that's on this side of the spectrum. If you go towards the middle. So what do you think? Like what size? Like 100 pounds. You can fuck up 100 pound thing. So yeah, that's dude man. You know you can take some damage, right? Like you're gonna I'm not going to come out like superman. I got, you know, it's gonna hurt. It's definitely gonna hurt. Yeah. I mean I might not. I might bleed out afterwards. Who knows? But. But you think you win overall. You got to do, what do you buy? Like 2:30 or something. So he sends me up over here.

Speaker 1:          00:13:03       Used to seeing dudes. They're not going to make weight 70 going to be a problem. Yeah. Nah, I don't know. You see how you UFC or MMA fan. Right? So like how, how, how hard can humans. Humans could kick pretty hard. But the thing is all I gotta do is catch them one on the bottom and all that. I really don't think I could break a wolf's job with my kid. I don't think so. It's crazy to think their body gives better than ours does. Like the thing about people, one of the things about people getting hit is that people resist. They tighten up. And that's true. That's one of the reasons why people get so hurt. Ever seen. The dude doesn't know how to fight. They get stiff and cracked and they wanted to hurt bad, but as someone who's like loose and relaxed, I don't think a wolf is going to be worried about you kicking him, but that's what I'm saying.

Speaker 1:          00:13:52       So I'm also an athlete, right? So I have a different perspective of. I've been in combat before that with the wolves, but I've been in combat before. Fell out and it's basically combat, right? Definitely. But, uh, I understand that you have to, you have to, you have to be as a, as loose with your body as possible. That's how you exert more energy, more efficient energy here than, than tensing up. So all that's in my head and plus I know what the wolf is thinking for the most part. I'm going to put up a video of a wolf right now. I'm going to put it up on a regular wolf though. Well, this is just a video that someone got recently at some dude found. I'm going to put it up right now. Check it out, Jeremy. Oh, it's posted. It's going to take like three seconds for it to go up, but it's a video that someone just sent me and I watched it and I was like, what the fuck? It was a guy on a road and he saw this wolf. Um, and you could see like, the headlights are on this wolf, this Wolf Lake. Just checking them out on the road. I'm terrified of wolves, man. I'm not saying I'm not scared. I'm just saying, oh, I mean in a life or death situation. Watch this. Look at. This is a Shitty fucking TV. When is this guy coming to fix this? To speed tomorrow. Friday. Thank God. Look at that as a big as well. Looking at him, checking you out.

Speaker 1:          00:15:15       But how bold is this wolf? And it's coming near headlight. So odds are he probably got his pack waiting though. Oh yeah, the pack somewhere. Unless he got kicked out, he might have got kicked him. It looks like an older wolf. He's got scars all over him. You know, he might be injured too. I don't think he's injured. I think he probably just got fucked up by one of the other walls and they just realized, all right, I'm going to find my own. It was a scary man. I'm with you. I'm pleased you think you can kill one? I do. I says, Dude, man, I think I killed coyote. Coyote. Yeah, but I might be wrong. I don't think you're wrong. Well, now, coyotes, foxes, foxes. Easy. Fuck y'all. Fuck a fox up. Set it up.

Speaker 3:          00:15:57       Exactly.

Speaker 1:          00:16:00       It's interesting. It's interesting to me how much, um, people have an opinion on wolves, like all of a sudden these wolf experts come at it. Oh yeah. No worries. I get, I think you kinda are though, right? Well, I know definitely not a wolf expert, but I know a lot about them.

Speaker 3:          00:16:15       You know what man I did. Um, I was on a Sitcom once and we had a chimp on the set and it was a baby chimp, like a two year old chimp and it had diapers on. It was like a little baby and it climbed it. But I'm bad. My back just slapped me a couple of times on the back just to play. It was just plan and I was shocked. I was like, how fucking hard this baby just hit me. This is crazy. And I grabbed his little body, you know, and he was being friendly. It wasn't being mean or anything, but I grabbed his little body and it doesn't feel anything like a person like you grew up with. Even a strong person. Like there's a little give to their arms. She looked even though like a fucking power lifter dude like the mountain from game of thrones.

Speaker 3:          00:16:52       I'm sure if that dude was just resting, if you grabbed his arm, this is a little bit of give to them with chimps that like courted steel man. There's, it does not. That's why a 150 pound chip is a strong as a 500 pound man. It feels like you're grabbing this table. Like literally. Like it was confusing to me and then I was thinking in my head like I just have it in my head that that thing is like, I would scale it down like okay, but person was that big, a person wouldn't be this strong, but then when you touch it you realize that is not composed at the same shit a person

Speaker 1:          00:17:22       and do other things though. Right? Yeah. Like you know, they, they swing around on trees and those, those muscles develop. You know what I'm saying? So can't, you can't compare a human size chimp? No you can't. No you can't. That's why when you see that hairless one and you see how jack has a different and plus they got thumb. So it's like they, it's different. So how big a chimp you think, fuck, I don't think I could fucking champ up man. Keep Champs. Maybe the one that you

Speaker 2:          00:17:51       fucked me up. Like he didn't know it. I'm, I'm not. I don't know. I'm pretty realistic. Then we say what? You're pretty realistic then. Yeah. So you think in like a kick to the face. That's the opening move with the wolf. Got To be God to be and he don't know what's coming. He doesn't go was coming, but he's going to leap towards your throat and I'm going to leap towards your job. I feel like you got to have that mentality and somebody sent me. Somebody sent me an article to write in Russia. Some woman, uh, survived the wolf attacked and killed the wolf. Yeah. Yes you do that. I'm not, I, I didn't read past she see. But that goes back to the whole chimp thing because the Russians are built different than regular white people. I feel you. I'm gonna ask you are an athlete.

Speaker 2:          00:18:31       But it's true. I just feel like saying, I just feel like if you, if, if you come in with the mentality of I got to beat this wolf. Look, there you go. I will access it to death. Come on man. Shit. Look at her. Wow. You probably have to be 56. She's probably drunk from Dagestan. Well those Dagestan people are hard as fuck. That's where Habib never got my office from a bunch of a tough fighters from Dagestan. Dagestan's filled with just straight killers. Like we have to information man, like right on him than anything. Jesus Christ. What does that human ken doll up in the upper right hand corner can't breathe properly, do to plastic surgery. Oh Jesus Christ. Look at that guy's face. What the fuck man? What doctor did that? They should find out. What doctor did that as a dude that. I guess it's a dude.

Speaker 2:          00:19:24       It seems like a not real thing. It seems like physically. Oh, the help of plastic surgery. Don't, don't even. I don't want to hear this talk. What the fuck is that? That's a. that's the world we live in today, man. The thing you'd have going for you is that a wolf doesn't really want to fight to the death. They just want to kill you. Exactly. They want to kill you. If they can't kill you, they might be like, oh, problem. Because Fuck Outta here. They said that about like mountain lions. I don't want to see them. I need them. I don't want to say one either. But if you get attacked, you're supposed to fight back. I heard a because um, my girl right now, she from the northwest area and we went on this little hike once and so she told me while we were there, it's like, oh they have mountain lions.

Speaker 2:          00:20:05       They had little packets on how to deal with if you see a mountain. And I'm like, if you'd have told me that there was mountain lions here, I will not have king. But anyway, so I'm reading the pamphlet and they say if you get big they usually like they get it back off their kids here. Throw your arms up in the area. Yeah. They say if you have a kid with you, you supposed to pick your kid up and hold it over your head. Man. I'm not sure about that. Yeah. I don't know. But people have killed mountain lions before with knives and shit. If you have a knife and get attack by, it's possible. Man, that's all I'm saying. Is this possible? Well you definitely definitely have to fight. You don't want a wolf to just eat. And if he had that mentality dog, you just have to like mentality.

Speaker 2:          00:20:48       He has to be. Because like you, I'm an athlete, so I come from like the mode of like it's either hit or be hit, kill or be killed, like people out here trying to break my bone. So like you have to have kind of a psychotic mentality. Well you definitely do to play nfl. Yeah. Just no doubt about that. I mean when you're staring down a team of super athletes and you're just going to collide with each other and try to get across lines and just a totally different way of living. Your life's weird man. That 99 percent of the world. I tell people that like I've had 14 surgeries in my career. It's just crazy. Like it's normal to me. And it's been one of the people that play in the league like after the season, like usually everybody gets a Sergio of something that that's been.

Speaker 2:          00:21:28       What have you had done? I've had a meniscus several times. I've had Achilles back, uh, my pinky, my shoulder actually played, um, uh, all of my 2000, 10 season with a broken collarbone. Jesus did that game three and it's still broke. You can still feel it, but with a broken collarbone. Yeah. How'd you do that mind over matter man? Is it like. Because. Because at that time I was, I went undrafted, right? So um, I had just got my shot to start and it was game three and I was having a really good season and um, it was either like if in the NFL, if you're not already paid, like your, your, your position is up for grabs. And so it's either, either you, you push through it or somebody's gonna take your spot. And so at that, that was my, that was my, that was my time to shine.

Speaker 2:          00:22:13       So I was like, Shh, painkillers man. So could you feel it moving around? It was weird. How had to protect it. My brother in law has like a metal piece there. He lost his and BMX accident. They put like a titanium rod. I think I need that man. Cause like right now it's dipped in. You can feel it. It's like dipped in. Did you ever like get it looked at a na [inaudible] cause I didn't want them to know I was hurt. And so because they bring that, they bring that shit up, like during when you're negotiating your contract. I was like, Oh, well he missed this because he was hurting and they bring that, they use it as leverage against you. And so 2012 was when I signed my contract the day after I was like, I just want to let y'all know I broke my collarbone two years ago and was like, no way.

Speaker 2:          00:22:51       I was a kid. I was like, no way. So I was like, get an x, y. and so we got an extra. I was like, Holy Shit, you did. I would be impressed. I believe that's the guy I want on my team. Dude. Played with a broken collarbone. It's bittersweet. Right? So like, as soon as you tell them that that's what happened, then it's like, oh, well he gets injured. Like it's a, it's a weird word. What is human? Who the fuck doesn't get injured playing in the NFL? I mean, you would think that's a rational way to go about it. You know, anybody who's played pro football didn't get injured. I mean, how's it impossible? I don't feel like it's possible, I haven't seen anybody. I watched the super bowl and one of the things I was thinking it was like, okay, you're watching all these dudes run and collide with each other and watching all these tackles. And like I was trying to stockpile. I was like, in my head I was like, how many injuries in my watch in here? Like, you know, because a lot of times dudes will walk off and then later that night they be like, Oh man, my fucking back is killing me. Right. It's the word.

Speaker 3:          00:23:46       And then you get it diagnosed and there's some sort of a bulging disc or something.

Speaker 2:          00:23:49       The problem I had because most of my issues that, that kept me off the field with like soft tissue injuries, which you can't. I can't run with, uh, with my hamstring won't get. But like all the rest of my stuff. Um, my problem became like my pain, my tolerance for pain, my threshold. It became so high that like, I don't even know what hurt and what was normal anymore. So like, I'm still kind of dealing with a lot of those aches and pains and stuff now, but it's like you just push through it because the pain was normal and you just get accustomed to it. Yeah. You just. Pain becomes a part of life. Wow.

Speaker 3:          00:24:20       Yeah. Did you always know that, like when you were, when you, I'm sure you played in high school and you played college, did you always know that this was eventually going to lead to like a point where your body just wasn't gonna be able to do it anymore? I mean, did you think about that

Speaker 2:          00:24:35       you set, you say that, right? Um, and people tell you about it, but you know, they say ignorance is bliss. Like you don't know it's, it's, it actually affects you until it actually affects you. And so like, you're like one of the worst games I've ever been a part of what we were paying Chicago and 2012 I thing and it was raining so they just run into the whole game and the next day I woke up like I'm limping, like walking towards the bathroom, like I couldn't. It took me about five minutes in my bathroom is like right there, so I took like five minutes and I was like, literally, like limping. It was, my body was just beat up most of painkillers as well from the game and like when you go, when you're going through it, you don't really realize it, but like towards the end of my career, um, that's, that's kind of why I decided to walk away because I was like, is, is it worth it anymore?

Speaker 2:          00:25:20       You know what I'm saying? I'm relatively healthy. I could walk, I could walk, you know, um, who knows what I've done to my brain, you know, that, that the onset of that comes on years later, but after awhile it was just, it just stopped being worth it to me anymore. And plus I kind of just fell out of love with it. That's a weird place to be right now. When you, when you're saying like you don't know what's going on with your brain, do you notice anything now? I'm not. Nothing that I haven't. No. I mean I've definitely had concussions before and, and earlier on, like the cte stuff kind of, um, that was like the product 2000, 1314 is when the science really started in the news media really started talking about it, but growing up like it was kind of just caught a dinger like he's got done and what I'm saying you got dinged and no one worried about the consequences and so we didn't really know.

Speaker 2:          00:26:09       And so it was just, it was just part of part of it. I've definitely had concussions before where you're like, not really sure where you are, but like somehow your subconscious knows what to do when you play. Wow, that's weird man. So you're out of it because you've got cracked and you just kind of gone through the game anyway. Keep playing. Do you remember it afterwards? A parts parts that happens. A lot of fighters, like they'll get dropped in the first round, right. And then there'll be on their corner and the like the fourth round headed into the fifth and they'll think it's the second round two. And then the coach go, hey you, you fought three more rounds and you think he did. They're like, what? Yeah, it's crazy the second round, right? Like, what the fuck are you talking about? It's, it's amazing to me that people are able to function on such a high level, not really conscious of what's going on.

Speaker 2:          00:26:58       That's got to be your training, right? Yes. That's all training is you're training your body to become second nature. So now when you were in high school and you were in college, was there any talk at all about brain damage? Was there any talk about cte or the. Not really. Nobody worried about it now. It was just not, it wasn't. The science wasn't complete. I'm pretty sure there were, there were neuroscientist saying like, your brain damage is real, but the science wasn't as definitive as it is now, but no one connected it the way they did with boxing. Uh, not to us. And to me, um, you know, like, like now people are, are worrisome about putting the kids in youth leagues and stuff like that. And they're even talking about not letting youth leagues happen. I'll have tackle football at all, which I'm an advocate for it. I don't think there's a, there's no point for it. I'm like, my kid, my son did not gonna play football. No, no. Wow. That's crazy. But you, you made it my body. So, so they could have a free ride or whatever they want to do, man. What if they want to play football? I'm going to say sit down, man. You gotta trust my man. Relax.

Speaker 2:          00:28:05       They want to be their own man. You know, I can't. I'm not going to physically stop him. I mean, I probably could, but um, I would, I would, I would, I would seriously sit them down and let them know the consequences, showing people and show them the risk factors involved. Like it is not worth it. I know you want to enter and I mean, as much as, as, as a son wants to walk into his father's shoes, uh, it's just not worth it, man. It's really nice and you're probably not going to be as good. That's just how. What if you kid wanting to fight like a, like box? Yeah. Box or boxer. I wouldn't advocate that either. He wouldn't let them do that. I'm pushing them to go towards like a education. I want them to be scientists. Like if I had to do it over again, I wouldn't never played football.

Speaker 2:          00:28:49       I really, yeah, it'd be a scientist. Not even. You would start from the beginning, like if you could go back to college and knowing what you know now, wow. Not even close and just because of the damage to your body will that. And uh, so it's, it's a weird, it's a weird thing. So like, you're, you're in your prime physically as a, as a man, but you're, you're in your infancy mentally. Right? Right. And so like I'm just now figuring out who I am and what kind of man I want to be. And, and you're, you're, while you're in your prime, that's when you're in the public eye. So you have to deal with all of that on top of figures. So you're figuring out who you are in a fishbowl. And it's, it's a really weird, really weird thing. So I don't even want to deal like, like any kind of recommendation or any kind of fame or whatever people want to call it. Like I don't, I don't like it, I don't want it. I feel like the best to me, the best, uh, society would be a artist and a scientist. That would be a ideal society to me.

Speaker 4:          00:29:51       Wow. That's an interesting take on things. Considering how successful you've been playing football, playing football obviously was very financially rewarding to you. Made you famous for sure. I mean if just some regular dude went on twitter and start talking about I can take a wolf farmer. I know that he killed. Nobody will care and be like, shut up stupid that anybody cares anyway, but it's fucking my twitter. But I said you were coming to school and was going to kill. I don't know man.

Speaker 2:          00:30:27       It's, it's a, it's a weird. I'm like, once you get to that, to that financial summit that um, everybody strives for that American dream. You realize that there is no there and if you ain't happy with $10, you're not going to be happy with a million. It's just not happening. Now, granted, there are some things that you need, you need monetary value in the society to, to a certain extent. I think they did a study. It's like after $75,000 a year, money can't buy happiness like so everything else out there is kind of, it's just luxury and really if you put it in perspective, I think like 35 percent. I mean if, if you, if you, if you make $35,000 a year, you're in the top one percent of wealth in the world. Yeah. Something like that. So it's all about perspective man. And once, once, once I. It took me to get to that financial summit to understand that unfortunately. But the weird thing about it is once you tell people that and you're on top of this financial summit, he's for you to say, I'm like, all right, of course. Yeah. Yeah. Easy for you to know. A lot of miserable millionaires. I do too.

Speaker 4:          00:31:30       It's really interesting that you said that like growing up and figuring out who you are while you're in a fishbowl and you were also involved in not just you, not just in a fishbowl, you're involved in like this competitive fishbowl where you're, you're, you're, your value is being judged by your ability to cover distance and speed, but your ability to score points or it stopped people from scoring points. That's kind of crazy too.

Speaker 2:          00:31:55       It's, um, football is not a place for a like thinkers and I'm not, I'm not saying that I'm the only person that has these thoughts, but it's like if you, if you like questioning authority and you're questioning a lot of things, like football is not the place for you because if, if you're inquisitive at all, it's kind of comes off as arrogant and it comes off as I'm like disruptive. And I never was. I was, I was always just like, why do we do things this way? Like why, why? Like especially like in college, right? So like football has this like weird, um, relationship with coach to player that like you can talk to other men, like you can treat them like shit. So the coach, the coach can yell at the player you piece of Shit, you're not doing it right. But if I use, if he was working at home depot and your boss comes to upc shit, you didn't stock that, buys the, it'd be like you'd be calling hr rather saying basis or weird for some reason in that arena. It's okay. And like I was like, listen man, if you want me to do something, like I used to tell my coach was like, don't yell at me. Like there's no reason for you yet because like one on one I could, you know what I mean.

Speaker 4:          00:32:58       Easier than a wall. Yeah. Man

Speaker 2:          00:33:03       didn't make any sense to me. Like why, why on this field is it okay. But as soon as we walk out to the field you want, you wouldn't, you wouldn't dare yelled at me like that. Why is that okay? And plus you got a hot head coming out of high school. Um, I mean I was, at least in a lot of us are because I mean, you usually come from those neighborhoods were,

Speaker 4:          00:33:19       do you think that's just because they have to control these big groups of super athletes so they have to kind of posture and like yelling at him, like you would yell at like a guard dog or something like that.

Speaker 2:          00:33:28       His cattle, right? So you just have to, you just have to. It was just that same old mechanism of fear, right? So people, people ruled by fear. So you wrote the biggest stick. So that, that's, that's how, that's how humans have done it for centuries. That's how they get into your head about who this leverage of you. I have fear, I have your scholarship, I have this, I have this. If you don't do what I say, all that gets taken away and it works. But for me it did it. And I was like, I don't, I'm in because of that. You're, you're labeled as like a trouble there. Yeah, like I was part of the reason why I didn't get drafted. I found out like the coaches said that, um, I was, I was, I wasn't coachable. I was like, Nah,

Speaker 4:          00:34:10       like getting yelled at. Wow, that's bizarre. It's seen that before. I've seen coaches screaming at athletes that could kill them and you don't see that in others. What, you definitely don't see that in mma, mma also like the coach relationship with the fighters, like a father son relationship and a lot of ways they're like brothers or at the very least family, you know, that's like an intense bond. I'm not saying every coach is like that, but it's, it's, it's a, it's definitely a culture. Yeah, it's definitely a coach. Do you think that's changing and like with this whole kaepernick thing and people are sort of aware of people being more socially conscious, more aware of people using their, their, uh, their fame for a platform to voice their voice, their opinions on certain social issues. Is, is that changing?

Speaker 2:          00:34:58       He has to because um, well social media is just changing everything. It's changing the way we think. It's changing the way situations are monitored because it's like a, there's a camera with you everywhere. So, um, but I think, uh, in a, in a, in a bigger sense, um, athletes in general are becoming more outspoken. Athletes are becoming a more well versed, um, they're really understanding their brand power and with that, uh, you have to change the way things have been, things that have been done in the past, like, like a simple stuff like training camp, training camp used to be two days full pads and you're hitting at a time, you can't do that anymore because the athletes are getting bigger, stronger, faster. So if you want your catalog last long, but you got to take care of them when you're practicing cattles that just talk like that. So it disturbs the truth though. No, it is. That's why it's disturbing. We get compensated heavily in the NFL or the NCAA. Is this a whole nother conversation? Those, those crooks don't pay their employees, but as far as the NFL, you get compensated and you, you know, the risks for the most part, you know, the risks going into the NFL. Like I chose to do this as a at a young age.

Speaker 1:          00:36:09       I'm glad you just said that. Those crooks don't pay their employees. Get out as a dark and dirty fucking business. College sports hate it. I hate it. I hate it now. I don't have anything to do with it, but I watch it. I'm like, that's cool. When you find out how much those fucking schools get from all those people in order to make sure that their team is successful because the alma maters wanna Yay. We fucking won again, and they did. They get billions of dollars. There are fucking huge, huge business man. It's the athletes don't get paid anything. Nah, man.

Speaker 2:          00:36:37       I've told many many times I've told my side of that story, man, I don't. I'm not a fan of the NCA.

Speaker 1:          00:36:43       I don't. I'm not a fan either. I think it's stealing. I think you're stealing from those athletes and ruining their careers. Most likely for you. If you do four hard years of college football, what are the odds you're going to get out of that without a permanent injury? I had, I think three or four of my surgeries came from college. Yeah. It's playing for free. You pay for and my buddy, hey, you get an education. And See, that's the thing that kills me when people say that, to say that I hate that.

Speaker 2:          00:37:12       So when I first went to school I wanted to study astronomy. Like that was what I wanted to study. So I went to my academic advisor and I was like, okay, this is what I want to do. Like it took me a year to figure out, okay, this is what I do. I was, I was in love with the stars in the college. That's one of the, I just wanted to know about it and, and as soon as I said, he's like, oh, you can't do that. I was like, why? He's like, because the, those classes conflict with the practice schedules in the meeting schedules. And I was like, well shit. And so I had to wait another year in order to find what I wanted to do and ended up settling for a philosophy, which was a cool major. But it wasn't, it didn't. I felt like if, if, if I would've got influenced by, by, uh, astronomy early on, then it would have changed my trajectory would have changed the way I thought about a lot or I'd arrived to the conclusion that I met now a lot sooner.

Speaker 1:          00:37:56       Yeah. The, the whole. You're getting an education thing. What are you getting a real education? Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:38:02       Hell No. Hell no, no, it's about, it's about a month, maybe a month or three weeks after the season before you go into spring ball, which is like, you're up at five in the morning lifting and running and Yada Yada Yada. Um, but there was like a three, three week period where they, they leave you alone and you're just like a regular student. And I did not know what to do with my time. I'm like, how, how are these, how are these people not ace in their classes? Like I didn't understand like how. I mean, granted they were taking courses but it's just like you have so much time. I didn't know what to do with my time because it before. Whereas before I'm up early in the morning, lifting weights, running, then go into class, then after class get a little lunch, then go to another class. Then you come back in, you're in meetings and after meetings you go to practice and after practice you get find some kind of energy study yet.

Speaker 2:          00:38:49       Well give me a rundown. So like what time of morning would you get up? So when you were in school? Usually. Usually I had some of the most. Most of my classes were the 8:00 classes, so 8:00 AM you're up now? I up before that. So, so independent on the day. So you have to get a workout in depending on everybody. Every strength coach has a different protocol so you have to lift at least three times a week. Three, three to two to three times a week. And so you either lift before class or before practice or after practice. So you have to, you have to find your time with after practice you got to be hard, right? You're, yeah. Really. Then you're just kinda going through the motion so. But do you, do you want to do it before practice because then you might be tired when you go into practice, you might not perform up to the best of your abilities.

Speaker 2:          00:39:31       Uh, I, I was, I was not the best at that. I used to get in trouble a lot because I was like, there's no way you guys can expect me to do all of this shit. I used to get in trouble for skipping weights and I wasn't big on weight to anyway. I'm like, I was like, I didn't see that because we had a lot of Olympic weight lifting and that's kind of changing too. We had a lot of like dead lifts and squats and shit like that. And I was never a fan of that stuff. I was like, this is not a conducive to being successful. What do you think is Plyo, Plyo? Uh, like yoga, Yoga, Yoga would real. Yeah. If we had a yoga, I'd have been there every time because it's like you're, you're getting loose. Any kind of you being limber is more important to me and strong in my opinion, especially in my position.

Speaker 2:          00:40:12       And my position, I mean that's something, there are some positions like d linemen and office alignment where you gotta you gotTa Push, but I'm not one of those because I wasn't one of those positions. Being a running back as like dbs receivers, like stay limber, stay hydrated with good nutrition. So for you it's more important to be flexible and to be able to move your body in very fluid ways. So to be able to avoid take downs, they will avoid somebody trying to tackle you, you, you, you more pliable is better in my opinion. Yeah. That's interesting. That's an interesting way of looking at it. So you would uh, they would force you to do certain amount of lifts. Yeah. You got to do a certain amount of lifts and then you got to go to class and you got to stay up and then when you're doing these lifts, so they supervised or you have to do coaches in there.

Speaker 2:          00:40:54       So that's another thing that bothers me too. I was like a rebel man because it's like they will follow you around the weight room. Right? Because some guys liked to like, you know, try to try to jerk the system and I'm like, like, this is what I want to do with my life. Like I'm not going to cheat myself. Like stop following me around. Right. It wasn't long. Yeah, it was like a weird. And then they have class checkers that follow you make sure you go to class class. It's just like, Bro, like I just feel like a little kid, man. I get out of my face. And so like after a while that just wore on me and like the whole system wore on me and on top of that, like I'm hungry. You know what I'm saying? You don't get the food out.

Speaker 2:          00:41:27       People get on me again. People from Tennessee hate me bro. It's weird. But I'm from Tennessee. Why? As I went to, I went to and for some reason, anytime I say anything about the NCAA, they think I'm talking about tenancy itself because weird. They're like, fuck you man. Like I, I still have people like to this day, matter of fact, yesterday a mom mentioned something about, um, like fumbles. I had from like 10 years ago. It's weird man. People will. Awkward Man. Well people love to bring up things that you've done wrong. When I was like 18 years old. I love it. Love it. It's funny man. It is funny. So you would get up in the morning and you would have to figure out when you're. So would you schedule your lifts and it's not a, it's not necessarily schedule is more like a um, whatever suits your schedule the best.

Speaker 2:          00:42:14       So if you have an 8:00 class, you get to go before class or whenever your break is during. How many classes are you doing today? Like two or three. And what? You're supposed to keep a certain GPA. Two point five. So you have to keep up to par. What is that? Like a c average and just like see, see averages. So you would go to your class, you do whatever you gotta do. And then how many times a day are you practicing? A once a day. Once you have meetings, meetings are like an hour 30 and the meetings are essential or going over strategy and go here. You get your playbook, your game plan, watch film on the other team or yourself. Is it hard to motivate yourself watching all that shit? Yeah, after awhile for me because like um, my quarterbacks are different. They don't have to um, exert as much physical energy as we do and they're, they're more on a mental game so they have to know the defensive games that the defensive coordinators playing.

Speaker 2:          00:43:10       Right. So what covers then wider, what the safety is doing. Don't have to know that as a running back you kind of have to know, but I'm not as much. You kind of just have to know where their blitzes are coming from. Oh boy. With the, with the intricacy, but after awhile I got it. I didn't need to watch much film in order me to get my assignment done. So a lot of times I'm just sitting there wasting time. Like I feel like that too. Yeah, I would imagine sitting there watching some stupid place. I always told my coaches, especially in the league, I was like, you could give me my game plan like Saturday before the game and I'll execute it like I didn't need. I think a lot of what they do and the NFL is just reinforcement. It's just over and over and it's repetition, repetition, and after a while, especially if you're a veteran, I get on there.

Speaker 2:          00:43:55       That's why Brett Farve, like when he was deciding on whether to come back or not, it was like I, I would love to, but all that other shit. I don't like doing all that. The meetings and that kept him back here. Man. He really just gets old. It gets super old man and you don't know what you're doing and you and you will, uh, uh, well versed in your craft. Don't you don't need half of that shit. And this is terrible for the younger cats that are listening to this man was something about a guy like Brett farve too, with all that fucking gray hair or grizzled old veteran. He's a goat milk still wanting to do it. Go crazy. Right? It's just crazy. They still wanted to do it. I mean, how many times I've been deemed as was saying, I don't know, get hit a lot though. Like, like get enough. You know, Jim Mcmahon is all fucked up now. I mean most ex players are.

Speaker 4:          00:44:44       Yeah. Most experts are. I was reading that sports illustrated article about Mcmahon and they did an interview on one of those sports radio stations. I was listening to it. It was disturbing and it was talking about it. He'll be like somewhere and you just totally forgot how he got there, where he's going, why, why don't have my keys in my hand? Where am I going? Yeah, I mean part, it's part of the unfortunate part of the prizes. So they would follow you around. They'd make sure you go to classes. Like what? Some dude with a clipboard.

Speaker 2:          00:45:13       Yes. Extra foster. Some ga. Now they will say anything though, right? Does anyone say anything? So like they would, they would send them and they would check and see if you're in there and if you're not in there they report back to coach and like, oh he missed on. So. ANd then you gotta go up to the coaches. I was like, well, why weren't you? I'm like, the crazy shit is in college. That's where you kind of learn how to time management as that's where you learn your time management as, as an adult, right? So they don't even allow you to become an adult. How most adults become adult in that college system. So like some teachers, some professors will give you a syllabus and say, here's, here's, here's going to be the work for it and show up when you want to show up, but you're responsible for your own information at the end of the day. For the most part, we don't even get that, uh, that, that luxury you have to go every single day, every, every, every class. And I'm like, not even, students aren't even required. Why am I required?

Speaker 4:          00:46:00       Yeah. You could study at home. You want it to maybe even learn more. And that was really good.

Speaker 2:          00:46:06       Beginning of like online, like syllabus is online stuff. So like I'm not sure if maybe maybe colleges have adjusted that to that nowadays. But from when I was, when I was going, they, they, they made, it was mandated you have to go to every class.

Speaker 4:          00:46:18       Well it seems like you're preparing for a career in professional sports, but you're also pretending that you're getting like a real education, like a regular person. Yeah. But it is kind of pretending because there's not a way you could be preparing for like high level college athletics and have the same time to devote towards studies. Nah, you can't. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:46:40       And that's why like that's why I say I would, I would do it again if I, if I had to do it again, I would do something else. He just wouldn't go football at all because I'm like the shit that keeps you up at night now it's not football. And that's how I knew I was tying to get out. Like I'm sitting on the sidelines and I'm thinking about other shit. Like what kind of show a physics like really up at nightmare. It keeps me up at night. What kind of physics? Theoretical physics. So what got me into it was relativity. That's what, that's what hookeD me, like einstein equals mc squared. What kind of just fascinated by the concept of it. Uh, it's, I don't know how anybody isn't man, like it's the whole store really. So you still. So relativity brought me in and how it happened was one day I was, I was actually hired man, so I was smoking weed crazy here and it kinda hit me because like you, you hear about what einstein did but you don't really understand it because I mean unless it sparks interest. Right? And So I was just sitting there watching the documentary and he proved how a light bends, right? So like gravity, gravity bends light and it just kinda hit me. I was like, that shit is crazy. So I just started digging more and more and more. And you researched, uh, the beginnings of when we started a research enlightened, the first place, like newton figured out that like breaks and it's just the whole entire science history of, of that, that aspect of light gravity is just blew me away. And I just, I just got hooked.

Speaker 3:          00:48:08       Neil degrasse tyson was here two weeks ago and fuck my head up. My head has been broken ever since. He said that if you go one g like out into space, like you say, if you are on a like a rocket, it shoots one g out in space. If it continues to go at one g, that same force because there's no air and space, the momentum of that because most of the time what they do with the rockets cutoff and then you just move forward on the momentum because you're in a vacuum, you just flying through space. But if you continue to propel at one g you will reach like just under the speed of light. So if you like, if you go into somewhere that's five light years away, it would take one year more. So instead of five years it will take you six years.

Speaker 3:          00:48:50       So it's 10 light years away. It'll take you 11 years. So it's a year under the speed of light. I was like, what in the fuck light. It's crazy how fast light moves and you can get that fast almost as fast as the speed of light by just going one. Gee, I didn't know that. That's been fucking with me for two weeks. I've been just, I'll sometimes get up in the morning and I'll just trying to, trying to think of how fast that is. She's crazy. Like if you were watched someone whiz by you, you wouldn't even be able to be able to see it. Yeah, it would be too fast for you to see it. And that's a person in a tube.

Speaker 2:          00:49:27       alright. And then you started digging into the relativity about that he's going to be aging slower than you. Yes, he's moving faster. That's really crazy. So that shit shit like that keeps me up at night man. And so like I wish like I'm to the point now where like I've done enough reading about it like an in and unless I start learning the math of it, like I've, I've reached my limit of, of, of what to know about physics. Are you thinking about doing that? Yeah, I'm probably gonna get back in school. Wow. What have you become like some fucking certain scientists that'd be dope, man. Go down there and work on the large hadron collider or some shit to me that that's more um, I mean I guess any, any kind of a goal that you set as a seven year old and obtain is you should be super proud of, but like my conscious tells me he's like, you haven't given anything to the society and that's just the way my brain thinks. And so it's like, unless I do something like that, like I just, I just feel like I've been bumping around on the. How old are you now? 30. Will you still got plenty of room? Yeah, for sure. I'll be, I'll be coming late in the game, but um, yeah, yeah. But you're

Speaker 3:          00:50:28       coming into the game with a lot of life experience, like at an intense level that most people just couldn't ever even comprehend I show. You know what I mean? There's gotta be some sort of enhanced perspective from playing football at the highest level in the world. I mean there's, there's gotta be something too that you're playing in the nfl, the just the, just the amount of intensity and just the problem solving that you're having to deal with on the field and just the overcoming the physical injuries, that mental strength did you have to have to deal with the kind of pain that you've had to experience that alone, all that stuff. I mean, all that stuff. It might not seem like it applies, but I feel like everything applies. I think every, everything, every book you read, every relationship you're in, every friendship you have, everything that you see, the changes, the way you look at life, all those things sort of added layers to your existence. Not appreciate the pep talk, man. it would be crazy if you became some crazy huge physicist. esther, esther, esther.

Speaker 2:          00:51:30       That was a goal of my man is to, is to definitely

Speaker 3:          00:51:33       bachelor's. What's completely possible now for sure. Bachelor'S as possible and phd is possible too if you really want to work towards it.

Speaker 2:          00:51:39       YeAh, it's a, it's a long agregious process. But, um, I think I'm up for a minute. I just want to do a little more relaxing because I just retired. And what

Speaker 3:          00:51:48       november and what caused you to retire? Like physically? Are you okay or.

Speaker 2:          00:51:52       Yeah, I'm, I'm okay. Physically it was just a little bit of both. So I had a couple of nagging injuries and I also saw him sitting on the sidelines and my, I'm just not into it. I, I remember vividly thinking like, I don't care at all who wins this game?

Speaker 3:          00:52:05       I don't care man. And like, and so like that's why

Speaker 2:          00:52:10       I love, I love Adam Gates. He's the, he's the head coach of the miami dolphins and um, uh, they, the whole organization in miami, like they, they let me bow out gracefully. They respected what I did in nfl and they were like, listen, like, you know, you do how you want to do it and we're not gonna make it hard for you because some organizations can be a dick about it. Like they could take money from you, they could do all kinds of shit. But they were really good about the process and It was because I guess it's the way I explained it to him, I was like, man, I feel like they have a good team. And I felt like if I'm sitting here just holding on for a check, I'm wasting your time and you're wasting my time. And so there is no, there's no reason for me to be here anymore because of my heart just isn't in it anymore. I appreciate what the game did for myself, my family, and it's kept me driven for 30 years minute, but it was just time ago.

Speaker 3:          00:52:56       That's a very balanced perspective for a lot of people. The big paychecks are harder to walk away from, of course, of course, but you have the point of view. You have the enough perspective, enough objective perspective, look outside of it and go, this is not, is not where I want to be.

Speaker 2:          00:53:12       And uh, it was, uh, it was a weird, a parting too because I, I, it's all I've known since I was seven years old every, every fall, like, and for one before. And even before that, getting ready for football, it's just all I've known, it's been, it's been my. And

Speaker 1:          00:53:25       um, I just got to the point where it's just a whole big world out there and I just need to, I need to feed off that. That's, that's very confident of you too. That's what's really powerful about that is that you realize that you're kind of starting from scratch, obviously not because you're financially successful and you've got some stuff going on, but you're entering into a completely different world now as far as like the potential of your future. Right. And it's,

Speaker 2:          00:53:55       you got to like, I've always been a humble cat man. I'm like, I never thought that I was any bigger or better than like, none of that shit ever mad at me because I always, I would be in the middle of a game man and think like, this is weird. People just watching this play a game like this shit is so it's like 100,000 people and you're like, this is so awkward to me. But I've always kept that perspective. Like I didn't think anything of it because I didn't think anything of it and it was just a game at the end of the day. And so, um, I don't know man, if the future is, is, is, it's wide open now. And I, like I said, extremely,

Speaker 1:          00:54:27       uh, appreciative of everything that the game has brought me though. Now when you were in college that the big thing in college football is always like the players getting paid off. They're getting money, you know, they're getting like any of that shit ever happened with you. Yeah. [inaudible] uh, uh, caused a big stir awhile back because I made it that, um, and this is a weird

Speaker 2:          00:54:50       thing too, is like, so players were mad at me for saying that. I was like, why? Why would you say that you fuckIng it up for the younger cats. And um, so like once y'all realize that these rules at the nca made or stupid and it, all it takes is for everybody to stand up and say this is stupid. Like they'll go away that their own separate entity. Nobody answers, like they don't answer to anybody, they don't own, they're just the ncaa and they have contracts with the television stations and so that's what's, that's what's keeping them in play. The millions of dollars. Billions. So if, so, if, if, if the athletes finally wake up and say like, my dad had a great idea. So say all the top recruits stopped going to the big schools, right? So they stopped, started going to place like grambling or what are some, some, some of the smaller schools, right?

Speaker 2:          00:55:38       Uh, that would take away the ncaas leverage and then you can start paying the players. And I'm not saying that they should get a salary like the nfl. I don't know. Those semantics can be worked out when the time comes. All I'm saying is the ncaa is, they're there, they're holding everybody hostage by a system that was put in place in the 19 thirties or twenties or something like that when the big business of college football wasn't even close to what it is now. Right? Yeah. So the sponsorships and all of that stuff, it wasn't even near what it is now. You have the tostitos fiesta bowl, you have to know is sugar bowl. These are companies that are paying millions of dollars in order to have them play under that,

Speaker 1:          00:56:19       under that guise. What seems to me like that. What colleges almost like a farm

Speaker 2:          00:56:23       team, if they don't want to call it that. Yeah, you're, you're pretending that these are students and the kinds of students, I mean that you make them sit in class and you make them get a c. There are, there are cats that play that are going to go pro in something that has sports, that's for sure. Do you think that it would be okay if they did it the way they're doing it now, but they pay the athletes and they make school and option that, that, that to me, we've discussed a lot of that van and um, I don't, I don't see a problem with that. And I'll tell you why. And I also think you should be able to get a degree in football because there are so many jobs at the nfl has, right? You have commentators, you have. Do you have staff that work all throughout the nfl offices?

Speaker 2:          00:57:06       Why can't you major in football? That's a great idea. It's a business. It's a business, but the reason we're treating it like it's not a business and we continue as soon as we wake up and say this is a business, I think progression will happen and it always does, but it, it. They're just holding onto this circular reasoning. No, no, they're amateur athletes. Well, why are the amateur athletes? Because we don't pay him, but why don't we paint? Because they're amateur athletics. Like, man, I guess it's ridiculous. Yeah. And I feel like if you did get a degree in football, then your time could be spent learning physiology, strength and conditioning protocol because it took me until I didn't really understand nutrition. So I got out of college honestly. Really? Yeah. I didn't really understand it. Um, there wasn't a nutritionist there, but like it wasn't as detailed as it is now.

Speaker 2:          00:57:50       Like what were they telling you? Like what didn't care? That was the thing. I didn't care. I was, I was, I was drinking a lot and I was eating a lot of windows, right, because when you're young, you're 19 years old, it don't affect your body, you can put whatever in your body really. Um, but then when you start getting a to where this is your job, um, and you can start filling those burgers on you the next day it was like, hold on, maybe I need to look into this. So I looked into it independently and that's what I, I didn't understand what nutrition for the body, I really don't understand, but you can, you could do nutrition, physiology, uh, everything that you're interested in and that is a helpful to your craft. Do you think when you're young that it doesn't affect your body or do you think you're not tuned in enough to your body to realize it's affecting you?

Speaker 2:          00:58:32       I think a little bit of both, man. Like you have to, you have to watch what you eat as you get older. That's for sure. And when I really started noticing it was like a 23, 24 when I was like, all right, those heavy weekends where I'm eating whatever I want and getting drunk or they're, they're, they're, they're fucking with me. So I have to really start looking at what is good to put them on board and whether or not you kind of know just based off the pyramid and you growing up here and what's good and what's bad. Um, buT once you, once you understand and break down the carbs and all of this stuff that you're putting in your body, you really, it takes your game to the next level. And it did that to me. So what kind of advice they give you in college as far as nutrition, what they tell you to eat?

Speaker 2:          00:59:14       A lot of the same stuff. A lot of little grilled. Make sure nothing fried. You don't want to, you don't want to load up on carbs. A certain kind of carbs are good for you. like so some carbs like sweet potatoes are really good. So they were giving me that good information. I wasn't, I, I wasn't ready to receive the information, so I can't fault them, but once you go to college then he started really paying attention to it. And what, what, like what did you follow after that? Uh, this ain't the same model that, um, so it was like the grill, the grill, the grill stuff, that's stuff like that. And then I have such an addictive personality. I started doing a lot, so I started getting into being a vegan and plant based, um, and, and so it led me to, they're like a researching food and nutrition, that lifestyle lifestyle's not for me. Uh, I tried it for about six, seven months, but um, yeah man, I mean I tried the best I could to eat as healthy as I could. But what happened with you, with trying vegan? Um, it was really good, man. I met a lot of good people with vegans come out of the woodworks to show the support. Uh, they also put you into a good team when you leave though.

Speaker 2:          01:00:32       Trader. Yeah, they get mad superman. Um, but, uh, you know, I kind of support the lifestyle man. I'm plant based, you can be a vegan and drink coke and eat chips all day, but like plant based lifestyle, I feel like it's really healthy and it really, I felt really good while I was eating like that. Um, but for me I got tired of constantly worrying about what I was going to put in my body. like, so every meal was a prep, I had to do it every single end and everything in our, in our lives is like a, a celebration and all celebration is usually centered around food and meat. So I got tired of doing that, so I was like, all right, if I died two years earlier, do you really think you're going to though? Do you think it's bad for the eat meat?

Speaker 2:          01:01:17       no. In moderation. I think if you just load up on a lot of me, it can be unhealthy. Did you, when you were, I'm eating a vegan diet, did you notice performance benefits? Uh, it's all anecdotal. I don't have any, you know, but uh, I felt like I recovered a little faster. Um, but again, it's all anecdotal and it could have been holding my head. I think just eating a lot of vegetables. We'll do that for you for sure. Whether or not you eat meat at all or fish or anything, I just think it's so beneficial to eat a lot of vegetables. One hundred percent. And look at one thing. I know a different show. Is it cleanse me like your, um, your bowel movements? Oh well it juSt slides out and that's not to get too grotesque man. But it's really important. Merrily I'll do it, but it's, it's you, you noticed a difference and you really understand what a healthy bowel movement is and what, or not healthy no matter if you're just eating cheeseburgers and stuff and you're not getting a lot of vegetables and a lot of fiber and yeah, people don't even know.

Speaker 2:          01:02:18       yeah, it's a different,

Speaker 1:          01:02:20       it's a different uh, especially if you blend it. If we blend like kale shakes, bridges, lubes the whole process. I wasn't big on the uh, on the blender, man. I'm big on it because I can eat way more than I would ever in a salad. Right. Like if, uh, there's only so much you can eat in a salad, but five, blend that shit up and break it down to 24 ounces of like semi liquid. RigHt. That's a lot of weight of vegetables and just seems to me that just massive boost of nutrients that enter into your bloodstream and your digestive tract. I'm just not as good with the patients. Yeah, no, I understand. What, what about protein when you were, um, being a vegan, what did you, uh, did you use like pea protein or a hemp protein? Like what kind of protein? We stay away from him because um, uh, they test for, for, for weed and they said sometimes I don't, I didn't want to, I didn't want to take the chance.

Speaker 1:          01:03:12       I didn't. Wow. I'm not well versed on what is and what is now some honest shit that doesn't test positive. No, I'm done. So I could do whatever I want and I don't know why they would say that because most, if you get good hamp. Well, I guess that's the thing is good. That's what they said. They seen him. they said flaxseeds can make you test positive. Well, you know, poppy Seeds can make you test positive for marijuana. That's crazy. Yeah. like people have tested positive on those random drug tests to give people their jobs from having a poppy seed bagel that's, you're shooting heroin. It's just like the fucking stupid. Anyway. Like in the nfl,

Speaker 2:          01:03:47       they need to, um, uh, let, let guys use a weed for, for pain.

Speaker 1:          01:03:55       Oh, for sure. It's ridiculous. We'll definitely cbds for sure because it's not even sipo aside. Snagged the cbd oil that comes from. It comes from hemp plant. That's not psychoactive. My were really good for you to super good for inflammation and joint pain and things along those lines. Matter of fact, when I had my, um, we actually, we have some right here. Sit right here. That's what it is. Yeah. This is a charlotte's web. This is actually one of my sponsors. Now they make hemp oil. Yeah. I didn't mean to play. I'm going to do it. It's actually on this podcast. I have to do a sponsor about it, but this stuff is great and you just take it drops. It's good for you. A negative effect.

Speaker 2:          01:04:35       When I had my back surgery in 2014 or 13. And uh, what did you have done? l five s one. I had a, it's this ectomy. Dissectomy. Yeah. Um, they uh, they prescribed percocet and percocet I used to. I used to take them for everything else. They used to make me like gag and throw up every single time I took them. And so it really, in any painkiller that was heavily, heavily sedate you, I would always like throw up and they, they told me that if you like, have a gag reflex too much, like you could read. I could of reset my desk really. So for like two days I was just like in pain after the surgery and my dad was like, man, go some weed or alex,

Speaker 1:          01:05:18       I'm gonna, go get you some weed. I was like, what? He's like, yeah man. So he went to. They're lucky that I was in la. I got it in la and had to dispensary. And so, uh, got some and uh, it, it helps immediately and I was like, there's no way that they shouldn't be okay, just totally be lyrical. Were being rude, being fucked, you know what I mean? It's slowly but surely it's starting to become legal recreationally. It's legal now in California recreationally. But the federal government is still resisting it because of the influence of the pharmaceutical companies and also a bunch of other people that like the prison guard unions, they don't want it to be legal because they have less people to arrest. It's kind of fucked up. Yeah. Know the prison industrial complex. It's scary shit. A real thing. They're making money off people being in cages.

Speaker 1:          01:06:03       It's like are people are human batteries and you get money off of this matrix. The matrix. It really is. It's like a very low level version of the matrix. But it's terrifying if that logic with all the science that's in place about what's dangerous and what's not. They're prescribing percocet. So like here fella, take these. Makes no sense. Young strapping, buck wants to take some shit that might get you hooked. They have this, they have this, this waiver we have to sign. So there's, this is painkiller called toradol in the nfl, right? Yeah, it's awful. But I took it a lot because prescribed that shit to my dog. Really? He's a great dog. Got bit so like for. So if a tornado we have to, we have to sign this waiver that says you're kind of just given up your. It's not, we're not responsible for but they'll let us take that, but they won't let us smoke weed and they're abandoned dudes that smoke weed and suspended dudes.

Speaker 1:          01:06:52       That's right. He retired because even just, um, I leave josh gordon. He played receiver for the browns. He was one of the best young receivers I've seen in a long time, but he, they banned him for a year because he tested positive for two or three times and it's like you throw it away. I mean granted he needs to be smarter, but like you're throwing away an entire medical career because of weed, like it's crack cocaine, you know what I'm saying? It's like it's trying to send a message to the youth to stay away from the illegal drugs. Reagan all over again trying to rule off of fear. It's fear, man, let's not based on reality. The reality is if you were to legalize drugs, period, you can regulate it and that way you can do it in a controlled environment and that way you don't have all of this.

Speaker 1:          01:07:34       I mean that's what they do with the prohibition of alcohol. Legalize it. Well, that's also what they're doing right now with an opiate. Pills. I mean oxy cottons are not illegal. They can be prescribed. They just have to have a doctor prescribes this ridiculous. It is pretty crazy. well, it's really crazy when people realize that marijuana helps pain relief as much if not better than all that stuff and it doesn't have any of the addictive properties and if you do the. There have been people that have said that it's addictive and there's some, some studies that pointed that in certain individuals, but I would state that those people probably addicted to fucking everything. I couldn't. I just don't call it physically. I don't get how marijuana is addictive, it just doesn't make any sense. I've smoked pot every day for years. Then I'll take like a month off and nothing.

Speaker 1:          01:08:18       Not an ache. A pain, not a no shakes, no nothing. Just you just don't have it. It's like drink orange juice then don't drink the orange juice. No. Really nothing there. Nothing happens. I'll get it, man. I was, I'm, I'm not like a heavy smoker like that, but like, um, like a, a, had on a saturday night when I ain't going nowhere. I'm all set up my pipe and my, my second. I'm going to watch a great movie. Why not fall asleep? Yeah. What the fuck is wrong with that? I don't get it man. And meanwhile you can get percosets or get drunk as hell and ruin your liver. Yeah. Yeah. I got, I had a nose operation. They've got my deviated septum fixed and this dogs began to nothing. They told me it was bad. It's people fucking complaining about everything. I remember before I got tattooed people like, oh my god, patches are so painful in the first tattoo.

Speaker 1:          01:09:08       I was like, that's it. That's the shit that everybody's competitive, man. Shit hurts. I always wonder, right? Not, not saying like not playing tough guy, but I really wonder what pain feels like to other people. I assume that I know what your pain is like. Right? But I don't know if that's true because why does, why do I like certain foods and other people think it tastes like shit. Yeah, and something's got to be different. It bothers me too. That's got to be different. Like your taste buds. It's not just simple like a. I can take it. I think there's a. I think people will experience different sensation. It kills me how people don't like spicy food. Like I love spicy Food. They make little kicking it. He's like, oh, why would I want to burn my mouth? I'm like, oh, why wouldn't you? And maybe I just like a little bit of pain every now and then.

Speaker 1:          01:09:57       Well, it's not a, it's a, it's a kind of a sensation more than it's a paint sorta. No, no, no. It is. But it doesn't hurt to you, but it doesn't hurt like have you ever had a habanero pepper? That's what I'm saying. Do you know what I have in the morning? I drink bone broth with habanero sauce in it to fuck. Yeah. Why? It's good. It's good for you. Okay. Bone broth. Both good and good for you. It tastes good. Like beef bone broth. And I put some. Put some habanero sauce in there. See that's, that's the. You deep into that nutrition? I can. That's great. I'm telling you, it's like, it's like a delicious tea, like a warm fluid. Sit down and have some bone broth. Dude, you would like it. I'm telling you. I'm open man. there's a place down the street actually that sells it. The California. So what kind of bones? Chickens. Really good. Turkey's good. You can taste it. A different kind of guy. Yeah. Yeah. Chicken is probably the best tasting bone broth. Jamie grease spot in New York. I went to called bravo broth. Yeah, they like my grandma's do, but it was just like, it tasted like chicken soup, just the water, the broth, whatever. They just boiling bones. That shit is brand. I've never even heard of people drinking boone's. It's pretty recent. I mean not really mean people

Speaker 4:          01:11:14       been doing it for a long time, but it's pretty recent as a fad around here in particular and there's a place out here, I think it's called sunlife organics. The joint that cells bone broth and they add, they'll add a little hot sauce to it and that's where I got the idea. I was like, ooh, I like it. And so then I buy bone broth, buy it in bulk, bring it home. I have like at any given time I might have 40 bottles of bone broth and refrigerator that's been entered. You know, she's great. I never even as it made his way to Texas yet. What about bone marrow? Do every bone marrow. Oh man. Never had a bone before in any aspect. Well, and a lot of fancy restaurants, they sell bone marrow and what they're doing is they're taking the femur of the cow.

Speaker 4:          01:11:59       They saw it and then they slice it down. The middle peter going crazy. Then they cook it, the bacon in the oven and there's like a gelatinous fatty substance in the middle that's incredibly nutritious and especially like these days where people are on these real high fat key to genic based diets are all the rage. A lot of people are eating bone marrow. Show them some bone marrow. Young jamie, they don't like that. So you'll get that and a lot of times people see that like with a little toast. People like it with toast, but you just take the bone marrow with a fork and scoop it out of that, that the dark stuff in the center there, scoop it out of there with a fork and just slurp it down. I love it, man. If it's on the menu, I fucking order it every time I got to try this man.

Speaker 4:          01:12:40       This shit is. What about organ meat? You eat organ meat like from actual liver heart and that's the way to Oregon either. Man. I'm from the inner city man. So I'm not that culture with the uh, with the pallet man. Well that's not even. I've been to, when I was a kid, my grandmother used to cook that. Live it. yeah. It's contrast to the city. So. Well I think it's one of those things were poor people aided initially because they didn't want it to go to waste. Like we're wealthy. People would eat like the finer cuts of meat. Like philemon, yon, you go to a restaurant. I'll have the full, a medium rare. But um, you know, people would shy away from things like liver and they do think that that's. But it's real good for you, man. I heard people eating it and you eat the chitlins too.

Speaker 4:          01:13:26       Oh yeah. I'll eat that. Christ. Do you ever have a menudo with the tripe in? It does a joint. ThAt's I gotta tell you, take you to this place, jamie. There's a legit joint. I will never say the address because Ins will show up and they'll fucking heartbeat. It's not a single person in their eating or working there. That's illegal, but it's so good. It's so mexican. That's menudo. Menudo. Menudo is they like to have it on saturday and sunday. I've heard of it. What is it though? It's a soup and it's a soup with a bunch of different jazz in it, but see that stuff in the middle? That's tripe. That's all cow stomach. That stuff that looks like waffles too. Like that. That's the interior of a cow. Stomach it. Take that and boil and chop it up at. Damn.

Speaker 1:          01:14:12       It is so delicious. I know you think like, I'm not eating that. I'm telling you man. And they. It's supposed to be a cure for a hangover. She looks gross, man. I mean, I'm not judging the taste. I'm saying it looks terrible. I'm telling you, if you just try it and it was gross. Put the uh, the bather on it. Pop a little bit. I know they do that right. That's always drives me crazy when they put like a piece of celery on your plate. Am I supposed to eat that tower? What's? Yeah. What's this? Garnish with parsley there. See that might look gross, but I never had it, but I've had it so many times. It looks amazing. You experienced with the motto, man. First time I heard it was in boulder. This is joint in boulder called pupusas. Is this just, it's crazy because it's in boulder, Colorado, like what kind of mexican food they're going to have in boulder, Colorado, so it makes things out there, but it a mexican right by say I grew up in albuquerque, New Mexico, so it's just south of New Mexico and to me new mexican food is better than like mexican food real because it's, it's different.

Speaker 1:          01:15:12       It's like, it's like smothered in the chili. They have chili's hatch. Green chili is real famous for. Um, and so it's, We'll see Colorado New Mexico have this debate over who started. I don't know who fucking started it, but it's good as hell. What's more prevalent in New Mexico? Think right? It's like growing up. yeah. But like you hear people in Colorado, but I had started here so I was like, man, you got It. Whatever man. I don't know, but I mean, green chilies and New Mexico are synonymous. That's like one of the things. Yeah, that's what I grew up on. So like when I, when I left, um, you know, I went to high school in san diego and I left and I like ordered something with green chili on it. It was not to Chile. I was accustomed to when I was like, what is this?

Speaker 1:          01:15:56       Like an order mexican food. It was like what I looked at as like texmex yeah, was just not the same and I was disappointed to say the least, but someone needs to talk to Donald Trump for the kicker. All these mexicans out, you're gonna fuck up the entire. He tripping. It's crazy stripping. But it's scary because you just give these people look if you give people the green light to start rating people and catching people when they're dropping their kids off at school, which is some of the stuff that I've been seen in the news. I don't know how much of it as happening or what's happening, but when you're making it dangerous for people to get an education, you're making it dangerous for kids to get educated. Right? It's crazy. The shit that gets me, man is like the majority of trump supporters are like christians. Right? And if you look at jesus's main messages, like love thy neighbor and Mexico is our neighbor. Yeah. I don't understand the disdain, like I don't understand them. If they do the right thing, that's what I'm saying. Their paperwork come over here the right way. The way my granddaddy did. Your granddaddy got on a raft, you piece of shit. You know the grand daddy, anybody came up with the mayflower, didn't have any fucking paperwork. It's crazy. But for some reason, like none of those facts matter. Those people like I don't, I don't. I don't

Speaker 3:          01:17:10       understand that man. All that turn the other cheek shit and all that. Some faggot. True that jesus wrote about back in the day before they understood that faggot shit was. People get mad whenever somebody said, how come every time you talk about trump supports use a shitty southern accent. Oh, well maybe because he'd get upset. Maybe I will keep doing it now. Yeah, it's a weird time, man. It's a real weird time. I fucking, you know, I have some weird ideas about nationalism and boundaries and stuff like that because I think that America is more of an idea than it is a place. I think America as an idea is a great idea. I think it's amazing to have this one place where there's like a, there's probably more creativity and more innovation in this country and more music and art, more, more fascinating things happening in this country than almost any other country.

Speaker 3:          01:17:59       I mean, there's great things happening everywhere. Don't get me wrong, but I mean this is a hotbed of creativity and innovation and art and I think that's what makes me proud to like to be an american. If I was proud, I'd be proud of like all the people that came before, all the people that were here, all the, you know, all the neil degrasse tyson's and jimi hendrix and all the fucking greg, you know, lenny bruce and richard pryor and all the art and comedy and writing and history and all the science and mathematics and all the great shit that's been accomplished in this one area. It's amazing. It's not a border, it's not like a line in the sand. To me it's more like an idea. So to me, the idea always been about people come here because they want to do better, so you're trying to stop people from doing better and they're like, well, they gotta they gotta fill out their paperwork and they got to do it right the way our grandparents did know, our grandparents didn't do it that way.

Speaker 3:          01:18:53       It was easy to come over here. Back when my grandparents came over, my grandparents came over on a boat. They came over from Italy and they just got on a boat. It was fucking easy. They got to ellis island. Sign here. All right, everybody's good. Go to work, but now you know, you say it's. You got to make it harder for people to come across, but it's almost impossible. If you want to immigrate from Mexico, if you're a poor person and you want to immigrate here from Mexico, good fucking luck. Good luck. It is not easy. It's not easy to come here from fucking Canada. I've had friends that have tried to come here from Canada. Yeah. Try to get a green card or try to become a citizen. Holy shit. Is it hard? It's a massive process. Like I, I have a friend, a good friend of mine and his daughter, um, met a guy in Colorado and she came down here and just got a new boyfriend, like, I'll stay with you in Colorado. She cannot work because she's from Canada. Well, because, you know, I guess they just assume like, oh, you're from that patch of dirt. You're not allowed to work over in this patch of dirt. And that shit, man, it's crazy. She's a normal functioning shot, terrorist. She's educated, she's smart. She talks well like, why can't you just work like everybody else could work getting work at jamba juice. Nope. I said it's paranoia man. It's like people just are afraid of everything and granted that

Speaker 2:          01:20:08       all real threats, you know what I'm saying? But it's like you can't, I just don't feel. I just don't believe in living in that

Speaker 1:          01:20:13       fear. No. It's just a constant state of hypnosis. Nationalism, you know, and it's team. It's a team mentality but not a team mentality and a positive sense. And a team mentality and an exclusionary sense like you're excluding all these other people from joining the team. Like, well if they all come over here then they're going to ruin our quality of life. Are you sure? I'm not. I'm not sure

Speaker 2:          01:20:36       man. National nationalism is. It's one of the worst things actually. I don't, I don't like it at all. Like I, I'm, I'm super proud. I love America. This is a dope place to be, but like I'm not, I'm not like, oh fuck your country over my country. Like it had never hit me. Like my pride isn't, isn't like that. And my pride is just like, it's dope to be from here and I enjoy it here. But like, eh, I don't have any disdain towards any of the country. I just don't.

Speaker 1:          01:21:01       Well, you know, what fucks me up, it's that team mentality. You could break it down to the macro level because people in houston don't like people from dallas. You know what I'm saying? It's like it gets goofY. I mean, dallas and houston might as well be Mexico in America. I mean it reallY might as well. But you tell it's big though. It's weird, but you're from. You're from houston, right? No, you live in houston. I lived in houston and dallas might as well be in a fucking civil war if you talked to half the people, they don't fight like, oh, you're from dallas, motherfucker. Let's do this. It's not like you want to fight, but if you tell people that you're, you know, you live in houston or you love houston, they're from dallas. Like fuck. ExactlY. Did they get weird in austin? It's kind of like the middle ground.

Speaker 1:          01:21:41       Austin like, well hey man, but it's kind of cool, relaxed, hippie brother tries to, hey guys, don't fight. Let's just be cool here in Texas. And then you got weird spots. So they're like, odessa. You might as well be mexican, I don't know. Dust. So you're trying to pretend you're not mexican. I've never, I've never made it out to any of the small, small parts of the Texas border. I've, I've had a friend of mine who lived a on what is directly across from juarez, el paso. They said that one of the buildings that he was at, he got shot, like got hit with a bullet from someone involved in gang warfare on the other side of the border like they were so close to. Or is thAt a bullet from war as hit one of the buildings? He was in a.

Speaker 1:          01:22:34       What is happening? Well that should know the region right there. You dumb. Fuck that. We got to kick them out of our country please. It's so funny arguing people, they just have talking points and they don't ever think about anything. Well, you know what? They. You can have talking points and you can have points and their points are okay. They're not to Be discussed and debated, but when people get so many solid opinions on certain things, the problem is that nobody has rocks out of the pens because they're usually. Their beliefs aren't based on any kind of a foundation and the research. It's all based on somebody that says something. Right. Usually on podcasts or television that they agree with and all of a sudden your opinion becomes a fax from sean hannity type shit. Yeah. I've never really watched him and um, I, you know, it's one thing if they weren't human, like if, if you had like some neanderthals to lived in Mexico and they were dangerous, they like to eat people like, look, we gotta we gotta fucking real problem falls coming over here eating us.

Speaker 1:          01:23:34       But no, they're just folks, they're just, they're just folks that people dehumanize people all the time. I may say I saw it at my sport and you see it, I mean in, in every aspect of life. Yeah. Well, how about Israel and palestine? Yeah. That is the craziest shit ever. I was watching this documentary on the history of Israel and palestine. What is it? Because I've been looking for one. Oh man, I'm So, so trying to do to quite a few of them out there. I need, I need to find one because I don't think a documentary honestly is comprehensive enough. I'd really good book like I've tried to read up on it and it just gets deeper and deeper and deeper. It's almost impossible to unravel. These people have been, uh, at each other. Like Israel is this one strange area, right, because you have this jewish state that's surrounded virtually on all sides by arab states and and they hate Israel.

Speaker 1:          01:24:29       Israel hates them and they're trying to push people out and then the palestinians are claiming that this is their land and they were pushed out and I used to do this bit and people just get so fucking mad at me. They used to get so mad at me because I was. I said that I was watching tv and I was watching this thing about the palestinians versus the israelis and I go, there's a brown skinned guy with dark curly hair throwing rocks at a brown skinned guy with dark curly hair holding a machine gun. And I'm like, you guys look super fucking similar. This like watching a tennis match machine. The williams sisters. I mean this isn't like the africans versus the nordic people. Like you could clearly tell like one if you've seen an african person and you see someone from China. Okay, well I see you guys look real different, but like israelis and palestinians there fucking so close until they talk. But you say that to people, they get so mad at you. We have a very different. Okay. I can't really. I don't. I think there's a difference, man, kind of, but it's similar enough that they could pass for each other, you know, things. I think that's debatable. Debatable.

Speaker 1:          01:25:37       We got the, uh, the, the, we're going to figure it out. That would be search type pictures way people, excuse me sir. Turns out the panel of students or one pound heavier on average. It's just fucked up when you see that kind of a dispute that you don't think is ever going to get settled inside your lifetime now. No, no, it definitely won't be an hard time. Like it's a state that was established in the 19 forties. It's still there today and there's still hotly under debate and you're wondering like, see that. That's why I, I'm so confused about. And it's such a hot button issue too because it's like as soon as you bring it up, he was like, hey, uh, you know what I mean? And I'm just honest inquiry, right? Because I don't really know enough about it. So I'm trying to read up on it and it's, it seems to Be super, um, uh, there's little red flag that raised it to me.

Speaker 1:          01:26:29       Then during this last republican, before trump was president, one of the republican debates were all of them on a panel, lIke they were just like, I'm super privileged Israel. I'm so pro Israel and all of them that I'm pro Israel too. And I'm just like, why are you so proud? It just made me think lIke, and that's what made me start digging into it. And it's like, I mean usually, uh, I don't agree with a lot of what the republicans say and so it just makes me think what is the underlying issue here? And that's christianity. That's a big thing because the pro Israel people, the really heavy duty evangelical christians, they really truly believed that inside their lifetime jesus is going to return. Right. And he's going to return to Israel. So. Oh yeah, there was a vice documentary on it. So that's what I mean, it's probably deeper than that.

Speaker 1:          01:27:16       It's probably the reason why. Yeah, well it's hard loan ally that's non muslim in that area. How did they, how did they become our outlier? Because we armed the fuck out of them, but I know that had to be a reason though, right? Well, I think we see the way they live their lifestyle. I mean there's very many reasons I'm simplifying it, but it's much closer to ours. Then these arab states, I mean women in Israel, first of all, they have all the rights that women in America do pretty sure other than the fact that they have to go to the army, they have to, they have mandatory army service and it's a lot of people think would be a good thing for America. Mandatory military service because it would make you understand like this about sacrifice and discipline and also that you're a part of this thing instead of saying, you know, we should go over there and kick their ass like whose we are you doing that?

Speaker 1:          01:28:04       Well you're going to send your kid. Exactly know. I mean that's, that's a lot. I mean, I think we'd have way fewer in her interactions with other countries if everybody's kids had to go over there and do it. People would be less than it would if it wasn't a voluntary thing. If it was an involuntary thing, we'd be much more judicious in our use of military. When you brought up that a dehumanizing thing. It's to me when when people bring a war and stuff like that, it's like they just throw out these numbers. Like those Weren't humans that died. That shit boggles my mind. like if that was your mother or your father, sister, like maybe maybe people do feel like we as he gave his life to a cause. But like for me it's like man, at the end of the day I was fighting for dirt and nobody owns. You can't take it with you and your box. I don't understand it. Well, not only that, it's impossible to fix parts of the world. Like if you look at it like what's going on right now in Syria, how many people are gonna have to die before they figure out that part of the world. I mean that like if you were there

Speaker 3:          01:29:02       you would just want to get the fuck out of there as quickly as possible because everybody could die at any moment there and any moment anything could happen. Missiles are slamming into apartment buildings. It's like you just gotta get the fuck out and that can happen in this world. Like the world conflicts can escalate to the point where they're just nonsensical where you can't make any sense of it. You just gotta get the fuck out. Like if you were living right now in Syria, I mean you would say, you know, part of me wants to fight for this. This is my city, this is my country, this is where I'm from. And parties like, fuck

Speaker 2:          01:29:34       this Greece, I will. Why don't we go to journal? I don't got that any man. I just, I just don't like. My pride runs from my inner circle and my family to my community and after that it's like, what are we fighting for? You know what I'm saying? Unless you're stepping in my, my home base, I don't understand the point, man. I don't got that emmy. Well, when you get to something like world war two, when you get to something like the nazis were trying to take over the world, that makes sense. Pushing into Poland and you go, okay, we got a real problem here. That make sense? It's crazy. Fuck. Might really like what's going on. North Korea, North Korea scares the shit out of me. See? And that's what I don't understand is like, so you got a juggernaut country like that who's basically waving a flag saying, I don't fuck with you, you know, I'm going, I'm all by myself and we don't really do anything. We don't really. Well, the problem is they do do things and they do know. They know that what I'm saying we to them you mean? Yeah, well we're looking at them now.

Speaker 3:          01:30:28       I mean those apparently this is all rumor and not who knows what, what was really sad, but apparently that's the main thing that Donald Trump was informed about. When obama left office. One of the things obama said like this is the biggest issue is North Korea. These is a maniac that kim jong un is a fucking murderous maniac and he's running a military dictatorship so and he's got prison camps and they've got these people that are born in prison. They're born prisoners, they're their slaves and they killed them. They do whatever the fuck they wanted them. If you don't listen to those people, if you don't listen to the military, they can kill you. You have no rights. You have to do with you. I mean, people were put in jail because they didn't mourn hard enough for the death of his father. Yeah. They were given jail sentences, hard labor, because they didn't try hard enough. We. We played it recently. There was these people. It's like the worst acting you've ever seen. The people on the street, while kim, when kim jong il died and they were just wailing, just fallen down. They couldn't. They couldn't cry hard enough and they had to do it. They had to do it publicly. It was so nuts.

Speaker 2:          01:31:32       See, that's what I need to do, man. I need to. I'm. I'm pretty up on my domestic politics. I'm kind of out of the loop on foreign policy and I'm out of the loop on everything. I just talked. Shit. I watched a few Youtube videos. I read a few articles occasionally. A book crosses my eyes. It's good to know. Most of the time I don't know what the fuck I'm talking about. It's too much to know. That's true man. That's. That's definitely true man. Like if you wanted to. If I. If I really sat down with someone who's a real expert

Speaker 1:          01:32:00       on foreign policy, you know what you really get you. You really get a guy who knows a lot aBout one area. if a re a real expert on foreign policy, say if you were talking to someone who's an expert on China, like international relationships with China, the international relationships with China, it's probably super complex, is probably so much to know and so much to understand it so much to go over like the, the, the for you to be a real expert. How could you fucking know all that? All right. How could you possibly know all that? That's one of my problems is like once, once I. Once I want to learn something, I got to learn everything about it. Like I said, I learned conceptually. That's good though. Yeah, there's bad though because like I have a one track mind so like it'll consume me for three months because that's how people get good at things.

Speaker 1:          01:32:45       So that's probably why you were a great football player. It's probably the same thing. I mean that's obsession becomes obsessive. Yeah. But I feel like that's the case with anybody who gets really good at things. You get just completely nuts about it, get absorbed with it. That's true because if you just casual about it, but the dude next to is obsessed with it. He's going to get better at it, going to get better, you know, just no doubt about it. Snow, no way around it, man. You know? I remember when I was a training jujitsu heavily, I would still, and I still had jobs and stuff, you know, I was busy, but I would meet these young kids. They're like 17 and 18. They be training two times a day and lifting weights as well, and just constantly going over new moves and I was like, this dude has no way I'm catching up.

Speaker 1:          01:33:26       There's one they have that. When you have that real true passion obsession, that's the only way to hit real excellence. That's true. I always tell kids like, man, they'll tell me like, um, uh, you know, I want to do this, I want this, I want to be at this, and I'm just like, you have no idea to discipline it takes in order to be the best at your craft. Like people don't understand that shit. Like people will look at like, um, the, we, we, we kind of take, take for granted the, the top of the top of the top of, of anything really, right? We take that shit for granted because you're looking at a finished product and you don't see the story behind it until it hits the news, hits the, the show that you love. Watching what the people who are best at what they do have been doing it for.

Speaker 1:          01:34:09       Like a great example is like, I'm a comedy right? So like, this pisses me off when people say like overnight sensation about a comic, right? But then you dig into their background and they've been working on like 18, 20 years they've been doing gigs or they've been going on shows and they've been just kind of harnessing that craft and then all of a sudden boom, they blow up and people are like, oh, overnights, bullshit. Comedy looks so easy. It does. Because you're just talking like you're talking right now. I'll just do it in front of a microphone. Say funny shit. You know how to talk and make a bicycle club. And a lot of ways it's kind of been kind of like running like, oh, what is your running back? Can run. He's got to catch the ball to catch a ball problem would be the greatest ever. I'm the best at running. How do you, how are you the best? I'll just add man. I just my mentality, I know I know how to do it, but I don't know how to catch that ball and run. man.

Speaker 2:          01:34:58       I like this last like two or three months. I've been, uh, I've been going to the, to the laugh factory and comedy stores and stuff or a comedy venues and uh, I just, I just have a whole new respect for comedians. that shit is so hard, man. It's like you go to a venue and people were just sitting in that chair, like, yo make me laugh. It's the weirdest shit ever. And you guys do it. Like it's, I got so much respect for comedians. There's a weird gig. Well, Not only do it with chuck out our material every two years. Exactly. That's where I'm at right now. I'm like four months in. Right? That's hard dude, because I'm working on shit. That's like, a lot of it's on rubber legs. It's not so super solid. yeah, some of it's solid. I would have asked. So. So what's the process? So it's like, do you think of jokes? Like do you sit down and I mean, I, I'm totally ignorant to this. So like, do You sit down and you'd be like, all right, I'm going to write funny shit today for like an hour or like, or just randomly go throughout your day and

Speaker 3:          01:35:54       this is a body man, that's the brazos. Now I'll be tAlking about some talking about some crazy shit. That's the main process. No, that's part of the process. The other part of the process is sitting down, um, uh, maybe a sit down, thinking about things like maybe just sometimes I'll watch a documentary to watch a documentary and sometimes I'll watch it because I go, I bet there's some material in this subject and then sometimes I'll just sit right in front of my computer or sometimes I'll sit with a pad and a pen and a piece of paper or sometimes I'm just in my car and an idea you don't want. One of the things that gets me, it's, it's, it's tough to do because I like to, I like to listen to shit when I'm in my car, but I find out when I don't listen to shit wanna just have the, the, the sound off.

Speaker 3:          01:36:46       No radio. I'll come up with ideas because my mInd is forced to think and then I'll write those ideas down and then once you wrIte those ideas down, any idea that you write down, it was like a seed, you know, and then you try to water that seed and you try to get It to grow into something that's viable and half of them don't ever grow. At least if you're lucky, have like, I try, I try to write some jokes and be like, let me see what these people go through. And it's just like, you know where to start. Yeah, it's hard. It's crazy. It's just a matter of starting, like knowing where to start is hard, but the key is to really just start. And then once you start then you sort of chop it down like you start, you write a bunch of shit down and you're all this nonsense, but maybe there's something right there. And he'd take that little piece of It and then I'll put that on copy and paste out on another thing. And then I'll start from scratch. So like I might write 1500, 2000 words and then out of those words is a paragraph there, maybe something in that paragraph and then I'll pull that paragraph thrown in somewhere else and then maybe I'll go back over that other 2000 words that I didn't, you know, take and I'll do it with fresh eyes like the next day and maybe a new thought. It's that process that we don't that like

Speaker 1:          01:37:56       I just, I just have super respect for a man because it's like, it's, it's a fun job though, man. Like, look dude, I've been doing it for like almost 30 years. You can't play football for almost 30 years. She gave up nothing. He goes, you're so glad about that. Your mind gets a little fucked up. Your mind can get fucked up. Your mind gets fucked up wHen things aren't going well. It's, it's always, it's, it's, it's, it's so intriguing to me how like comedians are really kind of like the narrators of our society and they kinda just, they, they find a way to like explain that shit. That's, that's normal everybody. And to look at it and see how silly is this shit. You know what I mean? And that's why. That's why I love. I love comedy is such an art to me man.

Speaker 1:          01:38:45       So you're thinking about doing it. I want to do it just like as a bucket list thing. Just to try and say I'm not, I'm not trying to be like a touring. I just want to like retirement. So I'm just like, I'm looking at shit that's interesting to me. I was like, I'm gonna try it man. This comedians, they get real upset about that kind of shit. Really? Yeah. Yeah. They go, these guys think they can do what we do not, but that's what I'm trying. But I don't feel like that at all. My, my feelings totally opposite. My feeling is you could, you definitely could definitely do it. I appreciate the smart guy. I'm pretty sure you're funny. I think you could do. I think anybody could do it if you're funny. If you're smart and you're funny and you're honest, you'll start. Everybody starts from a different spot.

Speaker 1:          01:39:22       Like there's some people that are just naturally funny. I met some people like my friend eddie bravo, I tried to talk him about doing standup. He did it a bunch of times back in the day, but he's just naturally funny. He just says funny shIt. He sees funny shit and I was like, dude, you're a comedian. You just never did it. like you could be hilarious because he'll fucking have us client some nights just ridiculous shit, but it's a matter of starting off with one step and then you learn how to walk and then you learn how to run and then you're going to learn how to run better and then you got to figure out the moves. I mean, it's really the bunch. There's a whole path to it. It's whether or not you're willing to take that path because that path might take 10 years.

Speaker 1:          01:39:58       That's what. That's what everybody says, man, I love good sets before those 10 years, don't get me wrong. It's not like 10 years. Then finally I got a laugh. Laughs all along the way, but I sucked. You know, definitely kind of take you awhile to find out who you are as a, as a comic and then that's the other thing though. You do a special. Like I just did my last netflix special bro. That shit with. So comedy. Oh thanks. The dolphin. Oh my god. No, that's a true story. I fell out, man. That's a true story. I was so high. I was watching those dogs. I'm like, how come nobody ever catches dolphins on official? Oh fucking smarter than you, man. We're filling with water people. I started really, really made me think. I bet it was gds. oh, thank you. That was really something that I really thought about.

Speaker 1:          01:40:43       I wrote a blog about it way back in the day. I think it's called hello stranger. Alright. About that. That very subject. That's what I love. Comedy man. Like yo, you, you find a way to like encapsulate the, the weirdest and most brilliant thoughts that we have tried. The problem is once you do one every two years, one of the things that happens is you run out of shit to talk about. Right? Right. Oh, you don't have necessarily anything to talk about, but what I liked to do then when I feel like stagnant is I like to not do anything, just let my brain like reach its balance. Just come back. You have ever just went on stage wIth no materials. winged it only on these shows that we do. We have these shows called stand up on the spot. My friend jeremiah watkins put on the show where you actually wing it to the audience of suggestion so the audience will yell out like a a bushes paintings because George Bush paints. Now you're seeing his painting not seen as this nice. Some of them are weird. Yeah. Not bad. Better than me. That's dope man. I mean, I don't know criminaLs or whatever, but he can separate.

Speaker 1:          01:41:55       You kind of have to. Right. I was trying to explain that to somebody about bill cosby and I was like, It's a very complex situation because he. Yes, he most likely did those things that they're accusing him of crazy. Pretty likely. Pretty like, I don't know. I wasn't there, but it seems highly unlikely that that many people, and there was always that rumor, there was always that rumor, but he also was a brilliant comedian who was. He was a rapist. It was like he was a brilliant comedIan. Alleged rapist, man. You got to got to say like, like, oh jay, right? Oh yeah, fucking murder a man. But like two could play. That was nice. Was nice man, but I don't. I don't understand how people can't separate your performance from you who you are as a human. I never understood that. Did you see the recent thing where his doctor said that if the understanding of cte was available back then, they might've used that as a defense as awful.

Speaker 1:          01:42:48       It's crazy. Well, what's really crazy is that doctor is essentially saying that jose oj did it even though he was acquitted. Yeah. He's in jail for. That means jail for stealing and shit. I know in that funny. He might get out soon. Yeah, I know who he is though. I thought it was like december. I think he has an opportunity, I think in october, but I think it's one of those things like a parole thing because I think he's in jail for 25 years, but I think he's been in jail for nine and he might get released, but is that what it is? It says october, but here's the thing man. You kind of know that they're not reaLly jailing him for that. Not really jaylin him for that. Which is weird that the the. Because he was trying to get back his stuff, right? Yeah. If people don't know the story of oj, I believe someone had stolen some of his autographed merchandise or as memorabilia and he was trying to get it back and someone in the room with them had a gun. Like the guy he went, we held. They held them hostage. They pulled a gun out. I think they had it out, but I think what it was was they went into the room with the people and lock the door and nobody's leaving, which is

Speaker 4:          01:43:52       like a kidnapping charge. Can't kidnap people. Man. That's crazy though, that we're supposed to believe that. That's what kept him in jail for nine years. So you definitely know because if you watched the judges deliberation when he was going to jail them, you could tell it was like we deserved the. Yeah, you deserve this. Like just throwing the book. If that was your first offense, you might not even be in jail. Yeah, I kinda believe they're not going to give him parole on the. I don't know, man. I just got to hold. The whole thing was so weird to me, man. There was a, um, there was a woman who was in the manson family who, uh, was one of the people that murdered Sharon Tate and she was up for parole recently and they were talking to her and there were, you know, asking her why she did it and how she did it and she just sort of explained that she was a part of this call to and that they had really kinda like convinced her that this was the way to do it and this is the way to live.

Speaker 4:          01:44:46       We have to fight these people and they're all on acid. They're all fucking freaking out. And she was trying to explain it and they're like, yeah, no parole explaining how she stabbed her and the woman was pregnant too, just to have the baby. It's just not, it's just crazy that some people go to jail for life, for stupid shit. Like smoking pot. Like there's people that are in jail for selling pot in there, in jail with life sentences. It must have. I mean, I guarantee you people have died in jail for marijuana sales. Guaranteed. Guaranteed. But It's still of kind of possible that if you tell somebody you could get out early, man. It's a depends on who you are actually. Oh, it must. But uh, it also depends on the overcrowding of the state, right? Like someone was telling me that a Louisiana in particular, uh, during new orleans during katrina, rather like when new orleans was getting flooded, my friend was like, dude, they had what they would call, you know, like instead of felt they would call it misdemeanor murder as a joke because dudes would be murdering guys and they'd be out in really short sentences because they just haven't heard about.

Speaker 4:          01:46:02       I heard about that. Yeah, see if you could pull up that term misdemeanor murder neW orleans, because like this guy was joking around about it and I didn't. I never looked into it deep enough to know whether it was telling the truth, but I had heard it more than once. They were just letting people out. Murderers. Yeah, I think, yeah. New orleans often accuses institutionalized missy misdemeanor murder. Article seven. Oh, one of the criminal code requires the state release. A defendant who has not been charged with a crime after 60 days before hurricane katrina, a few hundred people per year were released under article seven slash 11, so someone who committed murder, they wouldn't be charged inside of 60 days because they probably overburdened and they would let someone out. Holy shit, it's there. The big easy to get away with murder metal filler article. Wow. Yeah, so some spots it's just so fucking chaotic in a way with the people in jail. He's in prison for petty offenses. Drugs, still they are violating our rules. It's ridiculous. We have too many rules. You know, if that many people are in jail for violating rules, does that necessarily mean that many people should be in jail or does it mean we have too many roles, but you got to figure out like if someone is a victim of these situations is so as soon as someone's a victim, then that's probably where we should serve and protect. Right. I don't understand how people,

Speaker 2:          01:47:24       um, view our laws as the gospel. I mean, certain things obviously are demonstrably bad for society, but some shit like this is such a, there, there, there, there are things that could be amended that just needed to be. Man. What would you change? Like if you could, if you could geT into the judicial system? Uh,

Speaker 4:          01:47:47       well for the drugs there is no way that they should be first. Right? That's one of the big ones. The first one. That's one of the big ones. Um, what else?

Speaker 5:          01:47:56       Um,

Speaker 2:          01:47:59       oh no ma'am. I have to deliberate on now. I mean the, uh, the prison industrial complex as far as a locking up people of color has been a problem in our communities for years. Uh, I think that the policing needs to change.

Speaker 4:          01:48:17       I think that, and I think if you're going to look at other, I mean we juSt got done talking about this yesterday, but I think if you're going to look at other parts of the world saying they need our help places like Afghanistan where we've sent massive amounts of troops and resources into Iraq in particular, right? I think if they put that amount of money to figuring out how to build back these impoverished communities, I just, instead of just leaving them the way they are. Yeah, that's bad. Figure out some way. I don't know what the fuck it is mean because you'd have to like go through a couple of generations to get rid of the cycle of the negativity that some of these people have experienced growing up with all the crime and all the crime. PoverTy all the time. Yeah. that's right there together. And then also the momentum of that crime and poverty just, it's hard to break loose of and it doesn't help by putting them in jail or worse, it

Speaker 2:          01:49:03       becomes a mentality. So like I always found a significant like kind of growing up like in the inner city, like so like violence is so normalized, right? So it's like you like, like being, like being who you like being tough on the streets was like the good thing to be growing up and like, so if you've heard of somebody like it says committed murders or, or beaten up people or whatever like that, like, and this is fucked up, but like that, that mentality it reverberates through some of the neighborhoods is like that's cool. Like that's what you want it to be, not you don't want to kill people but you want it to be, to have that tough label and that, that mentality and that site, their psyche. It's infectious. And you sent me, so you see it with, with, with music and entertainment, it's,

Speaker 1:          01:49:48       it's, it's something that's embedded in our and our culture. And I started way back then but it's still hEre and it seems like it ramped up when it became a big part of a popular rap culture. Like when I was a kid, there was not, you didn't hEar about nearly as much gang violence as we did after, like nwa came out when you started hearing rap music with a lot of violence in it. Oh no. Yeah. That they were the originators of that. Yeah, for sure. But the violence in the neighborhoods, they really didn't start with the rap era. Started with the crack era, which the rat very came out of the crack era. So it all came together. Yeah. That's good. That's a really good point actually. And it's, you know, what else is a really good point too, is that, that all sudden it glorified it and it made a lot of wannabes and that's true.

Speaker 1:          01:50:35       Um, and I mean it's, it's unfortunate but. And that's why I love art. Art is always a reflection. It's a mirror of society, right? So unless you go to that lacma place, you ever go that la county museum of art and never seen him don't go. I appreciate that. It's one of the modern places where they have like a, a box on the ground. It was like a plexiglass box. I go, what is that? Is that that's the actual art, the plexiglass box, because the box represents what you want it to be. The art looked down at the box. It's really brilliant actually when you think about it that way because the box ended up. Man, that's a fucking box. It's a box. It's on the ground. You know what that is? That's a dude who you buy weed off of. That's his coffee table, right?

Speaker 1:          01:51:21       You go over his house. He said, hey man, I love this fucking amber plastic coffee table. You got bro. Yeah, dude, I fucking chop my buds up on this band is a nice tent though. Yeah, it's not bad, but the fact that it was roped off and that it was an actual. It's an actual piece of exhibit. That's a piece of art. Fuck you. I would never have got it. Looks like a fuck. You know? Someone else that's funded. It's funded. That's like, isn't it like who funds that? Who funds? Isn't that a big part of it is public. It's the la county museum of national art. Oh, that's amazing. Because what it represents a spaghetti and we all liked spaghetti. It makes you think about your child. That's crazy. You know, like that. What did you like string hanging from the ceiling? Yes. Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:52:05       Well, you know what, it reminds me of like string hanging from back when I was a kid. When you had to rent porn, you got to go through beads, like to get to the porno section. I was in my era, man. I'm way older than umass. I was there when it all went down. But see everybody, like a lot of. A lot of black moms and grandmas have to beat mexican mothers to wiser. A rock there. Is that an rps? The la lacma thing? Well that's an a rock and it represents rocks. Not appreciate how they got the rock. No, I don't because this guy could have paid for a fucking teacher. No bunch of shit. We just hired a better

Speaker 4:          01:52:46       group of. Of coaches for a football team. Dog. You do? I liked that one. Well that's why it's there. You know why? Because the world's all different, like hot food tastes different to me than it does to some folks. It must be. Some people looked at that and it goes, it's hazing and they got this feeling. I could just look at him. I can appreciate somebody pulling that rock there. Somebody might've even looked at that box on the ground and got that feeling. I'm not denying. They'd have to explain that one to me, whether they'd be like with this is what it is. It's like everything is so defined. Okay. And when you read a book, all the words are in the order. I mean, even if you're thinking about what this person wrote, they wrote it. Okay, so they're forcing this into your mind.

Speaker 4:          01:53:24       So this artist is giving the opportunity to. This is giving you the opportunity to put inside that box or to whatever, put whatever signification, whatever, whatever important significance of that box. It's all up to your interpretation, man. She has a point. I don't know why she. She, she might. She's transitioning. She seemed like she was transitioning while I was talking. I was like, I lost my girl. I started out as a girl and then I got annoyed and I became a gay guy for a little while at the end. That was the old lady who smoked cigarettes are very different. Right? Like you can go gay guy or lady was spoke cigarettes. There's that. See, this is where we put the stuff. Lacma. There's a video two. There's a video that was playing at giant screen and it was like people playing catch with a ball thrown into trip to like slow motion with like a volleyball catch. It was so fucking stupid. I was like, what are you doing? This is, you've got a video of a guy throwing a ball to another guy. Got to be able to express yourself.

Speaker 4:          01:54:35       I kind of feel them now, man. And that you uh, what's, who's funding it? Who's funding it? Did we find out the ball thing? Oh, the la county museum of art. They're probably mad at me right now. It's so snotty. They're good pub man. So snotty. So many people that were snoball taxpayers have last name. Oh, well I disagree with your fucking schools in la. Think about what teachers get paid. Think about cops lacmas most reliable patrons, 10 million taxpayers, and I guess people can sign up and give money if you like, being around on the weirdos. But here's the deal. Those weirdos, man to them. It's cool when they go there, they like it, you know, I'm a fucking idiot. It just because, I mean, are you a weirdo? I'm aware I'm an idiot because I don't, I don't know how you looking at that plastic box in the ground. Don't appreciate a bunch of people that like it. I got a question for you man. Okay. So, um, I've been a fan of you for a long time, right? so what? Thank you. Appreciate it. Appreciate you. Appreciate what, uh, what Made you make this switch from like being a moon landing denier to like crazy if we didn't.

Speaker 3:          01:55:44       If you don't know, I don't think we're crazy. No, this is. This is my take on it. Absolutely. I don't know enough about astrophysics, about space travel, about the science. That's the work that's been done about how to get a rock rocket to the moon and back. I definitely don't know enough. That's rocket science and I've looked at a lot of very compelling documentaries that explain why they think it was hoaxed and they'll show you some footage and you can look at some of the footage and it looks fake as fuck. There's some footage that to me looks really doctored. There's some delay yet to this day. Some guy would. When you ever seen ones where it looks like they're on wire, so to astronauts are on wires. I have. There's somewhere. There's a video where they look at their own trampoline there, bounced around on trampolines.

Speaker 3:          01:56:33       The physics are different in different videos. This is where it gets weird, like the physics are different from the apollo 11 moon landing. We see them waddle around on the surface of the moon. They moving it like half speed and then you see them in other ones like the one where they bounce around the area, like they're moving different during the same thing, but it looks different. The first one was very grainy. They showed it on a projection screen. It's just there's a. There's a couple different possibilities. One possibility is it just looks weird because it's on the moon and your brain is trying to interpret it and your brain's going, well, that's fake because you don't really understand with one six ers, gravity really does to a body of. That's one possibility. Another possibility, which has been shown to be true is that some of the stuff that they passed off as being legitimate photographs of space travel was actually test runs where they blacked out the background and pretended that they were in space and there's one really clear example of this is Michael Collins, Michael Collins, who was a guy who was a board apollo 11 and jim and I 15.

Speaker 3:          01:57:39       There's a photo of him in the middle of a sea of. What is it when they walk around outside the space, these facebook. Why does that seem like a bad word? It's like spacewalk, like if it doesn't seem like that's the official title is the middle of a spacewalk probably something more. A little more syllables. Yeah, something slicker. Anyway, so he's doing the space walk and he's got this harness on is holding onto this thing and it was apparently just an image that had already been published, have him in a training exercise and they blacked out the background and flipped the picture upside down. So same exact photo, same exact photo. I mean people have lined it up and switched it over. It's the same photo. It's just been edited. So the one on the left was them practicing how to use these. I don't get that.

Speaker 3:          01:58:28       The harness is some sort of a thing that you're hanging onto it. I guess it moves them around a little bit. They were trying to practice it on the left and the right. They just pass it off. But those are publicity photos. Right. Alright. So you got to go. Well, okay, well who approves the publicity photos? It could easily be just some idiot who works in the publicity department who didn't marketing and who didn't think they had enough photos from the moon that we're good of spacewalks. It's probably insanely difficult to take a spacewalk photo. So does that mean that they faked the moon landing? No, but it means that people fake things. So you've got to throw it, like, got to be really objective and looking at that. Okay. So people say fake things. They definitely filmed a lot of the um, the training exercises that they did have the moon landing.

Speaker 3:          01:59:13       They filmed a lot of shit. They definitely did. If that is already been proven that they took this fake photograph and they tried to pass it off as a real space. Right. It's entirely possible that some of the stuff that they filmed, they made out to look like they were on the moon when they were not. But does that mean they didn't go to the moon? No, it doesn't. And so when I was saying it proves that they didn't go to the moon, I, my critique of myself is that I didn't look at it objectively because I wanted one conclusion to be true and I wanted that conclusion to be that the moon landing was fake. So I looked at it and I Was and I was saying to myself, okay, did I come to this conclusion because there's a lot of evidence that shows it to be fake or have I seen a lot of evidence that looks fake and does that mean that they didn't go to the moon?

Speaker 3:          02:00:06       No, it doesn't. There's, there's a bunch of different possibilities. There's a ton of different possibilities. There's also the possibility that whatever photographs they took can get severely damaged in the radiation of space and it was really difficult to do. Right. That's possible too. And that they decided somehow or another that they were going to pass off these, that they actually did go and they're deciding they're going to pass off some of these fake videos. So there's a bunch of possibilities. The possibility that it looks fake because I'm dumb and because I don't understand anything about the physics of one six earth's gravity and it just looks weird because it's shitty film in 1969. That's possibility number one. Number two is they fake some things. Or number three is they didn't really have good footage because like you couldn't take film through the airport, remember that like people would go through those right radar detectors and you're filming get jacked and they wouldn't, weren't responsible, you didn't use film.

Speaker 3:          02:01:01       But I know people that might, you know, I have friends that are photographers and um, my uncle's a photographer and he would tell me, you can't send the film. Like if you have like you've taken a roll of film and the awesome, I don't know, I don't know what the fuck they did, but I know that some film has been damaged or maybe it's an urban myth. Maybe would find out. Film got damaged by a, those radar things in the air force. X-rays, ex-rays theory. I could appreciate the mindset though of looking at your opinion objective, lee, and saying, am I tripping? It's look at the facts and say,

Speaker 4:          02:01:40       I'm just not really sure. I think that's the problem with people today when people in period is that they're afraid to say, I don't know. YoU know what I mean? They're super afraid. It's like, to me, ignorance is such a gift, like it just gives you an opportunity to learn some shit if you're humble enough, like don't assume you know. Even the shit I feel like I know I still feel like I don't know. Yeah. Well that seems. You have a very healthy ego for a big young fucking super athlete. It's fucking fucking football man. Like no, but I'm saying he goes very healthy. You have a really good way of looking at things. I think that's the right way to be mad at. You can't be married to, to like ideas and opinions like that because they're not you, but we think that they are.

Speaker 4:          02:02:21       They're like an extension of us, so we want to win these arguments. That's why we want to be right. I think it gets real scary when you want to be right, and then you're willing to ignore evidence that might show that you're wrong. That's how I felt about myself and by the way, if you wanted to see if you wanted a conspiracy, that's a good one. That seems like it might be possible. The moon landings. One of the best ones, and this is why it's so attractive between 1969 in 1973. He's still on the fence about this, huh? No, no, not at all. I'm not enough. I'm on the, I don't know shit fence. That's where I lived, but between the facts on this side. I'm with you though. They sent, I think it was seven mission. Six of them were successful. The only one that wasn't successful as apollo 13.

Speaker 4:          02:03:06       right. They sent these fucking people around the moon. Two hundred 50,000 plus miles out there and back, but ever since then all they've been able to do is get people into near earth orbit ever since then, like the highest anyone's ever gone. I think it'S 400 miles, so they went from 260,000 miles all the way to the moon and back to 400 miles. Everything iS like inside and they've never gone through the van. Allen radiation belts. I never got into deep space and return. They haven't done that since 19, 60, 1973. I thought, and I could be wrong, but I thought it was because of like funding could be like, because you know we not lacmas got funds. Show me, show me how that makes sense. You don't want to fund space travel. You want to fund that fucking acrylic box or box editor by the way.

Speaker 4:          02:03:51       That's perfect. It is great. One, I don't, I don't think that I know whether or not we went to the moon, but I'm telling you that if you wanted a juicy conspiracy to get excited about, I've looked into. It's the best one to get excited about. I lost all the data I see because I see like, you know, you go down to youtube wormhole and you start watching barry sanders highlight and then I'm looking at a jfk being Michael Jackson and it. But like I, I, I, I, I just don't see what the motive would be like what is the fucking cold war? First of all, we wanted to beat the russians because we were in a race to see who didn't get to the moon and here's one of the things that we do know for a fact. The russians faked

Speaker 3:          02:04:38       a bunch of shit. They faked a bunch of footage. Yeah. Yuri gagarin, who's the first man in space. They had a video, might be an expert on this man, but there. Well, I studied this. I debated a guy who was a really nice guy, but I'm phil plait, who's a bad astronomer? Astronomer.com. Okay. And um, he, he was a lot of thIngs he wasn't willing to admit though that were unfortunate because maybe he could have convinced me more if he was. And one of the big ones was that warner von braun was a nazi. We, they hIred a bunch of nazis to, to run the space program. It was called operation paperclip and what operation paperclip was, where they took a bunch of nazi scientists and relocated them to the United States. We lost some of them to Russia. Russia scooped up some of them. But when we ended the world war ii and nazi Germany collapsed, we went in and took the scientists, will, wernher von braun was the head of a rocket factory in, in, um, in berlin where these to hang the five slow as jews in front of the rocket factory for all the other workers to see warner von braun, the simon wIesenthal center said if wernher von braun was alive today, he'd be punished for crimes against humanity.

Speaker 3:          02:05:49       This is news. No, wernher von braun was a straight up nazi and this guy was not willing to admit that, you know, it's like, well, you know, just because someone's in Germany. No, no, no, no, no, no, no. He was a nazi. He was a nazi. Were there any actually killed anybody? Maybe had to be a nazi. I mean, we're not saying that. Look, if you're fucked and you're in this neighborhood and that it overcomes the entire neighborhood, you want to keep your family alive. So you put that thing on your, uh, your jacket sleeve. You put that swastika on and you see a guy like everybody else. Maybe you're not really a nazi. Ideologically, maybe you're not seeing your heart, maybe just trying to stay alive. That's entirely possible too, but he was a nazi. He was a fucking nazi and they had slaves that were running rocket factories in berlin where they were figuring out how to make rockets.

Speaker 3:          02:06:37       I said, brandon, I got. I got. I need to. Yeah. Operation paperclip, cold war president truman authorized operation paperclip in august of 1945. The us army secretly admitted 88 german scientists and engineers to help the development of rocket technology, including wernher von braun, arthur rudolph, and her buttocks struggled. Her berkus, her roberta's hubertus ubertis. That's a great name. It's not a great name. Bring that back. If you have a fucking stud kid. It was like one of the strongest men in the world. His name is hugh bertis. My you. It was named after announcing, so that was like something in the debate that guy was not willing to admit, which made me even more skeptical that he was right about the other stuff. The other thing was that they like and moon rocks that they've collected from the moon have turned out to not really be moon rocks like a bunch of them for sure have been tested by scientists and they found that these rocks are from another planet.

Speaker 3:          02:07:39       There was, there was a rock that thEy gave to whoever's the head of holland and it was personally given with a plaque by neil armstrong, buzz aldrin, and Michael Collins, and it turned out to be petrified. Wood moon rock given to holland by neil armstrong and buzz aldrin is fake. It's a moon rock given to the dutch prime minister by the apollo 11 astronauts in 1969 turned out to be a fake. So they were giving people pieces of petrified wood saying, this is for you. We went to the moon. God bless America, growing 300, 8,000 euros. Now there's a bunch of possibilities. Okay, let's just be honest about this because this story's from 2009. It's entirely possible that between 1,969 that. Well, this is. There's multiple sources, but that's the telegraph. That's a legit news source for sure. What I'm saying is that it's entirely possible that someone stole that moon rock and replaced with that.

Speaker 3:          02:08:38       That's possible. That's possible, or as possible. They just had some fake rocks. Here's the thing. Bill clinton had a fucking. He had a quote in his book in one of his books, I think his book is called my life, and he had a quote about the moon landing and a story about him having this conversation with a carpenter under carpenter said that he didn't believe the moon landing. He goes, them television fellers they can make anything look real, and he said, this is a quote and bill clinton's fucking book. He saId, back then I thought that guy was a quack, but after our crank, whatever crazy person, but after eight years in the white house, I was wondering if he wasn't ahead of his time. Oh wow. This is a guy that was the fucking president of the United States and he's talking specifically about an old carpet telling them the moon landing was fake, and then he says, I wondered after eight years in the white house, if that guy wasn't ahead of his time.

Speaker 3:          02:09:37       Causation, correlation. Yeah, no, look, look, could be bullshit. Yeah, could be bullshit. One hundred percent. It could be just a good story and I think that's the thing about conspiracy theories is like they lead you on all these dead end chases. Oh yeah. What's weiRd is that trump's a conspiracy theorist is a lot more adjectives. You can add on to that. Yeah, but the conspiracy theory aspect is interesting as far as I know. he's to want to know about. You have those. That's probably what the first shit he did. He probably sat down. What's going on with the aliens? Where do we hAve an interest in it? Where do we stand? You would get It. I do. I do. I don't think we have been visited. Come on onto. Let me tell you something. Okay. You become the president. President foster. How are you, sir? Would you, uh, would you like to do today? Uh, I like to find out if there's fucking aliens. First of all, man. Oh man. First day on the job, I'm like, take me to the. I need to know

Speaker 1:          02:10:34       what the fuck we're up against. Are they real? I need to know. There's no way I would need to know if you knew that there might be a possibility. They knew you sat down with all the apps. I definitely had to ask you. Fuck ya know, if you heard rumblings of you and mike pence were in the elevator. Um, mr [inaudible] would be my vice president. Okay. who would you vote for? President and I am not mike. Mike, mike pence. But yeah, we own elevator. Who would it be? You don't want to be vice president? No shit bro. That's means you get shot at a sam harris. Man. That's a good one. That's, that's my, that's my girl. I would let him be president though. Have you had him on you a bunch of times? Really? Yeah. Bunch of times. He's on a week. two was crazy.

Speaker 1:          02:11:12       I'm subscribed to you on youtube and the shit keeps kicking me off and I don't know what's going on with that. Uh, that's, uh, the government tries to control me. It can't handle the truth. Man. Shit pissed me off. I don't know, man. I don't. I think it's just an algorithm issue because we also have an issue with them. We retweet. I'm like the, there's an automatic tweet that youtube does and it sends out that we're going live that we're broadcasting live. Tweets it out to people or sends it out, but it sends it in a fucking spanish. Was it like it was, it was the dark today. Today it says I started a live stream on youtube, but the last was, yeah, it was like dutch or swedish or a bunch of weird languages that I didn't, I couldn't speak. I said, interesting man.

Speaker 1:          02:11:52       Yeah, my, my, for some reason, my, um, my google shows up in my inbox, this is my name, like in german, like the inbox thing and says just in german, I'm like, I have no idea because you got hacked some german, godly man. Yeah, man, I don't got shit to hack though. Hm. Yeah. So the long answer of your question, that's, that's where I stood on this whole moon landing thing. That's why I came around to thinking in a different way that was way too convinced that I was. Right, right. I'm like, I'm convinced I was right, but fucking real low levels of understanding of any of the sciences and stuff. Yeah, I think that's the problem is as a society, we're so scientifically illiterate, you know, and that, that, that causes so much room for speculation and you're kind of um, kind of prisoner of, of, of, of people who are masters of their crafts, you're kind of a prisoner to their quote unquote agenda.

Speaker 1:          02:12:47       I don't want to put that, that bad of a term on it, but you're kind of prisoner of that because we don't have, we don't have any, any, any choice, but to take their word for war, to pursue it yourself. Right. To learn about what they're talking about yourself, but if they're right or not. Well that's, that's absolutely the case, right? BecauSe you know, that's the case in almost everything else. Like that was always like a real problem with martial arts was there was this one dude who had all the information and you didn't know and then you would listen to them station and we're like, whoa, is that true? And you would think it was true. But now like there's videos you can watch on youtube of like some crazy kung fu. Dude that's just talking nonsense. He doesn't really know how to do anything. He's just got some crazy thing about cheap power and if you don't know, you think this guy is real. But once you know you go, oh you motherfucker. So like someone can pull

Speaker 3:          02:13:31       the wool over your eyes about that. They could just easily do it with any kind of science

Speaker 2:          02:13:36       rocket traveler. And see that's what really got me interested in science. It was like you fall, especially with this climate change shit. So like you start reading the articles people give you why it's not real and then you go and follow the source. Like that's where I really learned to start filing the sources at all the articles because it's those sources that you lead to the main source of where the information actually came from and it usually leads to like a scientific paper published in a journal and they're fairly easy to understand because it's very with the math and the in the, in the actual science is probably won't understand, but like you can get to the break down how they got to that conclusions and that's what I can appreciate about is it actually gives you a uh, an understanding.

Speaker 3:          02:14:20       Yeah. With citations shows you each what we, each study was all about certain things on it. Yeah. That's super important to be able to look at that stuff. And obviously they've got a lot of math. I got a lot of times though, man, I do it. It was biology. Sometimes I do it with like, um, different discoveries event. I got obsessed with this chimpanzee that they found the Congo. It's called the bondo ape. And I start reading as much as I could read about this chimpanzee is one chimpanzee in the Congo. That's way bigger than other chimpanzees. It's enormous. It's like a six foot tall, 300 pounds. Pansy. They walk upright. The huge, enormous chimps. Not. Okay, well they have two different kinds of chimps to like the locals called him a tree beaters and that they have another one, I think they call them the ground dwellers and tree beaters.

Speaker 3:          02:15:04       I think that's what they call them because the, these chimps are so big that they nest on the ground, like gorillas. They don't even bother climate trees jesus, but it's just, they're limited to this one area. They have a crest on their forehead, like a gorilla where it's a high crest of the bone. So they have these big massive plates of muscle that they bite down with. and then they have like this gorilla crest. Regular chimps don't have that. RIght? So when they first found skulls from these things, they were confused. They were trying to figure out was a hybrid between a gorilla and a champion. But then, um, um, did you, where'd you get that? That looks like that looks fake. It looks weird. That looks fake, but see that one? Okay, go up to go push your cursor above and then go slightly to the right.

Speaker 3:          02:15:47       Go all the way to the right. Keep going. No. The bottom level. Bottom level. Yeah. No, no, no, no. Were those those pictures right above? Just go straight above. Now. Go to the right, to the right, to the right. One more. Next guy. That picture. Sorry. Yeah, just make it bigger. That was taken by a guy named carl. I'm on. He's a swiss wildlife photographer and he became obsessed with these bondo apes in, I feel like it was somewhere around 1996 and he moved to the Congo and he stayed there for quite a while trying to take photographs of these really elusive animals, but they got that one on a camera trap and it's a fucking huge chimpanzee. There's another line that is dead that they shot

Speaker 4:          02:16:30       and it's uh, these two guys hold it by the. That'S one for sure. But that's a pretty bIg one, but there's that one right there. That's a way bigger one. They shot that one at the airport. It is fucking huge and it was shot somewhere, some near some airstrip, so that's like one of the big pieces of evidence other than now they have bones and they have a scat samples and tissue samples so they know they exist but they're really, really, really hard to get to because the Congo is like almost as wide as the United States and it's just filled with fucking crazy shit that can kill you. Everything everywhere you'd go is just monsters. Just everywhere. Fucking crocodiles. Wild man. And the people that are dangerous as fuck too. Yeah. But this area is particularly dangerous where because it's so. It's really difficult to get them.

Speaker 4:          02:17:19       But I got obsessed with this god damn thing, so I was reading everything I could read about that. All right. I have never been. No, I've never heard of it. Never fell in love with the apes like that man. I'm fascinated by apes, man. I feel like we're so close. We're just, we're just the hair, but I just took. So to me, there's just, when you look at them, I, I got super high once when I went to the zoo and hung out, I was by myself, sat in front of a chimpanzee cage for like a good solid hour man. Washington's champs. I was on an edible.

Speaker 4:          02:17:56       They sent you back and I remember like watching them interact with each other, thinking like they're, it's like they're like people but not. They're like people, but wAy more brutal. Way more. Certainly way less paths. Airy, kind of airy. Not too long ago I took my kids, they love it go. But um, I don't remember what kind of primate it was, man, but he was just hanging on the cage and we was walking by and he was just kinda like following us. And I was like, I felt so weird man. Like it was almost like he was like, what's going on man? How y'all doing? Like he wanted to. It was the weirdest shit. I wasn't even on the edible. Yeah, it's weird when you see their nature come out there like us. You ever seen one? There's one where a little kid was like pounding our chest in front of the window and patch himself after he cracked it.

Speaker 4:          02:18:48       I saw that was he cracked the glass man. Y'all need to be in there, man. Yeah. They shouldn't be in there. I don't. I mean, the only. The only thing that I could see that would make sense why you want to keep them there because if they're so endangered that you need to keep them alive in these contained environments before they figured out a way to reintroduce them back into the wild. I don't know, man. It's thinking as part of the evolutionary process. It's like 99 percent of all species have died off. Yeah. It's part. It's part of. So you think we should just let him die. Let him die. Whoa. That's deep. It is. I know that people want. People don't want to hear that, but it's just showing me what everything dies. You know what's fucked up?

Speaker 1:          02:19:28       What if we're killing? What if we're letting these gorilla stay alive, but really if we just let them die, they would evolve into something way cooler. That's. That's what I would have said, don't know. That's the shit that I've been thinking about dog. It's like, all right, so the evolutionary tree of life, right? Like we have fucked it up. I don't want to say fuck it up because it was definitely a part of it, but it's like we're directly influencing it and I just wonder what, like where's it gonna go from here, like what? All lifeforms do that though, but not like, like we've kind of escaped because natural selection is all about survival and it's all about, uh, that's basically it. Just adapting to the environment to survive. And now it's not about that anymore. We don't, we don't adapt to our environment to survive anymore.

Speaker 1:          02:20:15       We, we create our environment. It's different. It's definitely different. But it's still adapting to the environment because instead of using like physical tools aNd attributes, we figured out a way to do it mentally where we create things that can alter the environment. What I'm saying. So like still what it signals is to me is a new form of life. Like it's a physical structure like structures and things that we're using, whether they're um, household appliances or electronics, all that stuff is evolving as well, like it's all happening. Right? And so that's the new, like the new ability to adapt. It's all coming out of these things instead of coming out of us. We're putting our work into that. But that's what I'm saying. I, I'm, I'm not sure about, I don't think we've ever seen this part of evolution a arise like this before. No, we haven't not like this now.

Speaker 1:          02:21:05       And it's crazy to me. I don't like, I'm just so like I love that live in the time that we do the information age and all that shit, but like I still want to be able to live like 300 years from now to see where we're at in society. I would love to see that. Yeah. Would love to see it too. But I'm scared. I want to see it happen though. Like this now I like this. Now I'm fascinated to see what this, what's happening here. I am too, but like, like I, I want to see ai and I want to see, um, I want to see life on other planets. I think ai is going to turn out like blade runner. I think they've run it. I don't, you never saw that. My one thing, so I saw blade. He never said I saw that too.

Speaker 1:          02:21:41       I don't know. Blade runner, blade runner is harrison ford movie about these artificial people that are so difficult to tell that they don't even know they're artificial. People know. Well, they're gonna they're doing it again. Right. Who's going to be the blade runner guy now is harrison ford in it. Again, that would be crazy. Rutger hauer gosling and harrison. Ryan gosling. Yeah. Good move. But it was um, two great science fiction movie, man. Ryan gosling can act till polish it off. It's, it's a really good movie, man. I got to check him out. Still it holds up to. It's one of those few movies that holds up. I got to check him out. It was probably like about the, I mean the movie was made, I want to say in the nineties, eighties, 82, 82. Yeah, that was before my time before everybody's time, but it seemed. I think they were like saying it was like 2030 or some shit like that. Two years.

Speaker 1:          02:22:39       That is so funny. They always think that it was going to be way more crazy than it is crazy. We got to have a boys man. Yeah. But you know, what they never expected is the craziest thing, which is the internet. They thought that our, our evolution would term would be like people would fly around in cars like they had flying cars and shit. That's what they thought was gonna happen and then they would have artificial people that you couldn't distinguish like a surrogates. Well, they were the rutger hauer character was the most fascinating one. I check this movie out fucking movie. That's my favorite shit. And there's that girl that was. What was the name? Shawn? What was her name? She was a huge deal for a long time. She was a huge movie star sean. Goddammit.

Speaker 5:          02:23:25       But

Speaker 1:          02:23:26       she was one of those people, one of the first people that we saw, um, and the younger generation, Sean Young to like sort of crack from the pressure of startup success, just woo woo. Crazy. Yeah. That fishbowl. The fishbowls no joke. Right? It's, it's a weird thing man. He said weird, funny shit. a man. So like I'm having dinner. I got my kids and stuff. We hAd the table and just a couple of years ago. And um, I mean houston is, some guy comes and says, hey man, big fan man. Can you take a picture of my baby? And then puts his baby on a table. Well what the fuck? Like it's the weirdest shit ever met. And people do weird stuff like that all the time. I suppose baby on a table on the table, I'd take a picture of my baby and I'm like, baby off the table.

Speaker 1:          02:24:10       That's so weird. Yeah. I mean you probably get all the time people do weird shit. It was. So that's a weird one. Click here to take a picture of a band. People like, people like, oh, I like hold my baby. They take a picture. I'm like, if I drop your baby, do you know what kind of shit I'd be like, I'm not holding your babies. What is wrong? Why would you want me to hold the baby? Has no clue who I am. Like doesn't care. People are strange. Maybe once milk people are fucking strange. I think the the. At least you were a young man when you experienced that would freaks me out. It's child stars. I couldn't because it's accused like you never get normalcy. No fucks you up. You, you. There's no normal. However you never get it. I know you're, you're, you're born famous. Like if you're famous when you're seven. Telephone. Do you remember before seven? I don't remember. For 74 is when I really started like, okay, I'm in the world.

Speaker 1:          02:25:03       jamie, you got any memories or when you were seven? Few of like being at a babysitter and like maybe. So if everything from seven onwards. Fame. It's a funny story. My mom to this day dot d, she denIes it. So I have this vivid memory. I was three years old and I used to have a babysitter right across the street from my apartment complex. I used to to africa to name, but one day I come into the room and there's paramedics. I didn't know they were paramedics, but there's paramedics and she's sitting, she's laying on the couch. She was pregnant all the time and I see her. Her belly split open. Well, I saw csection at like three or four years old. My mom does not believe me to this day. She's like, there's no way you saw csection. I'm like, how do I notice like how, how do I.

Speaker 1:          02:25:48       And I, I didn't say anything at the time because I mean, how did I know that didn't happen in every babysitter place run? No, I did, but I saw it as a kid. I was very bad. They should have. I'm not sure why they didn't take me out of the room. Like, that's disturbing man. But as a good fee to see this, it's just information, right? Like nobody got hurt. It seems like a crazy thing, but it's how life gets into the world. Like if I was like cutting a belly open and I see a three year old, I'm like, you should probably leave the room just in case. I doN't know what it did to me. Right. I don't know. I wouldn't encourage a three year old to do it like that. I know it'd be good. Oh no, it's good for the kid. Didn't know. He needs to leT them know what I'm saying. Get up, quote billy. Don't be a pussy. If you're going to make this place contaminated.

Speaker 1:          02:26:36       Some girls do it just to keep their pussy tight. Are you serious? Yep. I'm not taking any chances. So selfish. Mm. Or they're just having a national woman's. They look. They're like, listen, the kids going to be fine. Debby son was born by csection. He's fine. The kids find that is crazy. That's a real thing. Yeah, it's a real thing. Yeah. Aura. There was a thing that you've advertised. Jody is used to have a joke about, about vaginal rejuvenation. You know, they used to talk about that all the time. That was like a. Because it became a thing where they could type that baby back like so. So to know everything else bro. I bet if you have a big thing and you have to make a small thing involves cutting, cutting and stitching and I would imagine that would be. That's a weird. That's a weird place to get cuddled.

Speaker 1:          02:27:27       But I couldn't do it. Ooh. Yeah. And then what happens after that? What if it's too tight when it doesn't work anymore with dr. Fucks up nonsurgical.

Speaker 4:          02:28:22       flights out of kennedy that was directly going there. Good morning America. YeaH. It's a real thing. Yeah. Look at it. I had no idea. This is my favorite part. did you know that you age and every part of your body, you're talking about old pussies. They just planted a thought in your head, but knew patrice o'neal and say age, like age, like bread. Now like why? Hold on, go back. Don't, don't scroll down. Look at the top paragraph here. female wellness is just as important as taking care of your face. What in the fuck does that mean? I would agree. Yeah, but what she's saying, female wellness. She's talking about having a tight pussy. You got to be a low bit man. Sell your product and you can't just be saying, yo, fix your box. Women, what business are you in? Um, female. What does that mean?

Speaker 4:          02:29:13       I've tightened them bitches up west side aesthetics is introducing a revolutionary technology that rejuvenates the vaginal area and remarkably restores women's confidence, their confidence part of life, though man, sex is a huge part of life. Look at this shit. Thermiva is a 30 minute nonsurgical treatment that gently applies radiation radio, free radio frequency, rf frequency to reclaim, restore and revive feminine wellness without discomfort or downtime. Downtime from dick. Where's the. Where's the small ones? The small print that is a small print like I'm really concerned that while getting rejuvenated, I can't take dick. Oh no, there's got to be a before jamie. Go back. Go back so I could read more of that stuff.

Speaker 4:          02:30:13       yeah. This, this is crazy. It increases nourishment to tissues by stimulating blood vessel production and increases sensitivity by stimulating nerve regeneration. Okay. That doesn't seem true because I've. If everything that I've read about nerve regeneration is it as a very slow and tedious process now it is like if you get injured, right? Yeah. So my dad actually had. We not sure what happened, but he kind of lost feeling in his arm. He a pinched nerve. I think that's probably what it was, but like it's slowly creeping. It's way too. It was like two years ago and it's slowly. He still struggles with it, but you know, he's slowly getting better slowly as slow process though. Real slow, super slow. My friend boss route and the former ufc champion had a neck surgery. He had something fucked up in his neck and his arm shrunk to the point where he calls one arm is baby arm atrophy and it's coming back now.

Speaker 4:          02:31:09       Slowly but surely. But every time I see him like a year later, it's like a little bit better. Yeah. I mean it's multi, multi year process and this guy was ufc heavyweight champion and he was a bad motherfucker has prime and it got him to the point where it's. And it doesn't even grow back. So you telling me they just blast your pussy with some radiation and those nerves are going to go back. Why wouldn't they take that nerve pussy thing and put on boss rutan's arm? You know, I have a female wellness on my own. Yeah. Well, It was embarrassing, but to get my arm back had to go to the female wellness center, get I had a. I had a stick in the vaginal rejuvenation machine. Hey, whatever works though. Yeah, but if it did work, that's probably one of the first places they would use it on a lot of things that we could use.

Speaker 4:          02:31:57       Female wellness or just call it female wellness is hilarious. Female wellness. Definitely a cool women know what you're talking about. If we're talking about like give you talk about like women's health issues, you go, oh abortion, you know like women's rights, abortion. I know you're talking about abortion, but you see women's rights when it comes to like a woman's health rights, reproductive rights. We're really talking not just about birth control pills but also about abortion. So if you say women's reproductive rights immediately people think abortion, but if you say feminine wellness, you don't think. I think. I think like breast cancer. Yeah, that's what pops up in my head. Yeah. I would say it is deeper than that. Juvenile nation, they're using it in a weird way. They kind of co opted that term. Feminine wellness is important, bro. It is important. It is. Sure. Confidence is everything. Confidence is everything. And if you know you got a rejuvenating pussy, this puts a sparkle in your eye. There is no denying that pep in your step. It's just the way she's tried. I know she got the procedure done. I'm going to ask her. Don't ask her bro. Just get pissed. So, uh, what have you been doing in your spare time? You get, you're a pussy, rejuvenated or anything.

Speaker 4:          02:33:08       They will never admit it to the end of time. No time. Mother's pussies. amazing. Everybody's putting in my family is amazing. We have amazing pussies. Then for this fucking conversation, deteriorate. Another word on here for just a pelvic exam is another word for I just googled wellness or whatever. Female wellness exam that popped up and yeah, see, that makes sense. Like a pelvic examination, checking you for issues, not tightening up your box. I'm scared of that prostate thing. That's come scary. Or you already did it. The finger in the ass. Checking for a physical. For physical. They put a finger mass. Yeah, whoa. Hey man. Very uncomfortable. I wasn't, they just lube it up, stick it in there. and I'm dreading it, man. It's weird. People have problems though. You got to be that prostate problems or real issue with people like you. How many people have like ball cancer, prostate cancer, and my grandpa, my grandpa died from prostate cancer.

Speaker 4:          02:34:11       Cancer scare the shit out of me. And what scares the shit out of me is um, our society, like what we've created is so awesome. Like have been in the city is amazing. Being able to go to a restaurants, amazing. Being able to fly on a plane, go across the country. Look, all of a sudden we're in Florida. It's all amazing. The food that we eat, the fact we get food anywhere. The fact that you can go to wendy's and just pull right in and get a burger, but what, how much cost is that on our biology? All that amazing stuff. Like how bad is it to be in a polluted area? Like how bad is it? What life expectancy is actually the highest it's ever been though it's true. It's true because people have great, they have great medicine and procedures and they catch things early, the really good at treating cancer, but what, how good are we at recognizing what's causing that stuff?

Speaker 4:          02:34:58       How much of it is diet? You know, how much of it is nutritional deficiencies in your diet? Probably think it was the number one killer is heart disease I think. Yeah. I think heart disease, which is also connected to obesity and a lot of folks. Is that the number one retailer? oh, cigarettes. Terrible. The fact that that's still around and it's crazy. When I was a kid, um, when I was like 15, I smoked a cigarette once when my sister, my sister's, she kept smoking for a few years after that, but it was a couple of friends. We just moved into this neighborhood and I'm like, I'll try it. And I was like, this is so crazy. Like the fact that anybody wants to smoke that first pool, like I felt like I was gonna die and you're voluntarily and what are you getting out of it? You get like a little buzz a little bit. You get a little bit of a. That's what people who smoke cigarettes. I'm like, well I want you to just smoke weed. Like you actually get something out of it. Like you just sit there and die. But I felt you get like kind of an opposite thing out of it because with cigarettes you get an ah fuck it feeling like I don't give a fuck. Who gives a fuck the fuck it. I've never felt that man. That's what I got.

Speaker 6:          02:36:04       I never got this article came out. Sorry. Like came out like seven days ago or earlier this month. Building near freeways in la. Not supposed to be within 500 feet of a freeway. Just definitely do.

Speaker 4:          02:36:14       Ellie keeps building near freeways even though living there makes people sick. Are you one of the two point 5 million? Southern California is already living in the pollution zone. Wow. Yeah. When I pass on the four, oh five, and there's those. Look at this jesus christ. People there suffer higher rates of asthma, heart attacks, strokes, lung cancer and preterm births. Reeks. Recent research. Recent research has added more health risks to the risk. To the list, including childhood obesity, autism and dementia. Wow. Wow. See that's when you click that recent research button and see what they talk about. Boy. Yeah. There's apartment buildings like right off the four. Oh five when you're driving towards santa monica. And I'm like, that is like, you're living right there. Especially in la man. Don't go nowhere. It's just like, it's just a $15 everywhere man choking in it. Do you like living in Texas?

Speaker 4:          02:37:09       No. No, no. Were you going to settle? I haven't figured that one out yet. I was um, I was thinking around, I think denver, but I heard never was super dope, but I had a buddy that just moved from la. I'm from denver to la and he's just like, man, it's just, he's just dead over there. I can't. I got to be alive. And I'm like, oh, it crazy. I feel you man. Go to the mountains, bitch. The mountains, not an outdoors do. It's definitely dead in terms of like city action. It's nothing like this out here. Yeah. Denver is interesting though, is denver's had legal weed for a long time because they, they basically weren't arresting people for it for the longest time. They had kind of said like a state or a citywide thing that they weren't going to arrest people when I first came there, like I don't remember what year, but I've been working at the comedy works in denver for a long time and when I first went there they were like, yeah, we don't arrest people for weed and I don't want to like, yeah, they passed something in the city where they don't arrest people for weed in the city.

Speaker 4:          02:38:09       I'm like, that's crazy. But this is Colorado. Like I thought of colorado's like cowboys, like, like, well you think of Wyoming, the republicans and real strict, but denver was never like that. It's like a weird. It's a weird town man. What, what's. I mean, you know a lot about dishes. What started the movement in denver to go towards progression and we. Well I think the statewide movement of Colorado making marijuana legal and being the first state along with seattle or Washington state rather. I think, um, Colorado people don't like people telling them what the fuck to do. That's a big part of it. I mean, they're rugged people. you've got to realize if you can, if you're family made it to Colorado, like in the 18 hundreds of whatever, you got some rugged jeans is that deep. Oh man, those people move there. There's a core group of people that settled in Colorado during the gold rush manifest destiny man, when people came over and it's crazy.

Speaker 4:          02:39:08       homestead, get blocks of land and stay on it for a few years and he can get to own it. Yeah, man, that shit all happened. And those were the gold rush people, man. All right, right. I mean, wasn't that what Colorado was originally settled? Wasn't California was right? California gold rush. Like why the fuck do people go to Colorado? That's what I have no idea. We'll put google. When was denver established? I'm going to guess I'm going to take a guess. I'm going to say it was like the 17 hundreds. Now I'm going to go after that. Eighteen hundred 50 1800. 18 50 slash 50 18, 58. Holy shit. Perfect. That was really good. That was pretty good. And I bet. Very good. So think about that. What kind of gangsters traveling across the country? You know, you had to be a bad motherfucker to get across the country if you live here, right?

Speaker 4:          02:39:58       In California. The same thing holds true like the people that first got here, like in the 17 and 18 hundreds, whatever it was and at first settled here, but then everybody comes in here and all the actors and it's just the. Well gene pools water down. But in denver that gene pools not watered down. You've got a bunch of people in still, right? The original dna is of just gangsters who came over here to try to make it in the wild west. So that's interesting. So you're saying the liberalism of the move from east to west and the, uh, the gene pool of not giving a fuck. That'S interesting. Yeah, it has to be that there's definitely something to it because if you think about it, all the, like the really like there's a giant group of immigrants in the east coast, this country. And there's also like a real hostility that's almost like ancient on the east coast of the country that's different from the hostility on the west coast.

Speaker 4:          02:40:55       It was like an ancient sort of like shitty way people get along with each other in New York. And you could attribute it to the call that you can attribute it to the weather. You know, you get attributed to about overpopulation but on top of each other. Yeah, you could. You could attribute it to that. I think in both things could be possibly true. But there's other spots like you go to Canada and the weather, the weather's horrible. Like toronto is crazy traffic and a lot of people and they're nice as hell. I heard. Yeah, I went to Canada once. They're so nice, so nice. So I don't know what it is, but I think it has something to do with the fact that the original people that came there or these hard scrabble people that we're trying to make it by getting on a boat and traveling across the ocean to a land that they really didn't know much about me.

Speaker 4:          02:41:36       He might've known someone here, they might've had an uncle or family members and they were going to try to settle. I mean those are gangster people. You have to be so and then the people that were sick of those people like, fuck this, we're going to keep going and kept going west. And then in 18, 58, they settled in denver. I mean those were rugged people, man. so when you see that city there and that city is embraced by the rocky mountains, so you have this constant natural beauty around you. It's like a little bowl to it. I mean it's a bowl and you look out your window. Like if you stay in a hotel in denver, you look out the window, you're like, whoa, you see the rocky mountain and you're like, holy shit. Real clean city to like a super guy was while I was walking downtown and it's like they keep it up here.

Speaker 4:          02:42:19       They do. Yeah. It's also like you have to be a certain kind of person to be able to survive that winter. You know, you got to be the kind of person that can just fucking tolerate shit and still show up at work and get things done. you can't be a baby out here. You could be a baby. How you can be like, I don't like to go out when it rains because all the oil on the road, it's like people don't know how to drive in it. It's not doing this. I'm going to call in and I'm going to say in, in Colorado they have to go to work on black ice. People juSt sliding around on each other like bumper cars fast, very fast and the furious. And you ever hit black ice or driving. I've never hit black guy just like the cold. So I'm one of the whining people getting out. While you don't have to like the cold. This is the thing man. Especially a guy like you, you've, you've, you've, you've proven yourself. So physically tough. Nobody could ever say that. The reason why you don't like the cold because you're a pussy. No, no, no, no. I just don't

Speaker 1:          02:43:12       like. Yeah, I'm definitely not a pussy. That's what I was fucking. Definitely. Not that. That's what I was a famous football player. Pitcher, right? I'm not a pussy. I just not stupid. I don't want to be cold. I just don't get to see it. I also don't like being hot though, you know? Well you tell those people, why don't you just be cold all the time if you're such a bad ass, why we're close. What you need to be warm. You fucking pussy. Oh, sometimes you need to be a pussy, but right now you know, fuck out of here. Like people live in san diego. Like one of the things that you'll, you'll talk to you about, you know, if you have a bunch of buddies that live in san diego and they asked him about it, like why do you live in san diego?

Speaker 1:          02:43:46       They're like, it's never shitty here. The weather's perfect always. Why would you move? I went to high school down there. It's with part a mission bay. Oh, that's nice. Mission beach area. So that was the craziest part is la jolla. They've got a comedy store out there as different and they got these mansions that overlooked the ocean and everybody's on pills as a whole is like is like a different. A different areas. Too much money, so much money out there. There's too much money whenever you get too much money in an area, just like nobody knows what to do. I didn't know what to do. Yeah, but they get crazy. That's. You start buying yachts, snorting coke and on the yet. Yeah. You're crazy, right? I can't do the water either though. That cornado island, that's a. That's a crazy rich island saying this isn't a white white people and whites. Usually the case. White people. White people go, let's plant the flag. Melvin white sand to go with my wife. My wife's parents.

Speaker 1:          02:44:54       Yeah. That core. Datto island. There's a bunch of fucking donald rumsfeld lives there. It's one of those places are nice. It's exclusive for sure. yeah, it's weird. It's like a wave from san diego. You actually have to go. You can drive there though, right? You can drive with the drive over. Some crazy bridge going out. They probably have dynamite on the bridge just in case fucking riots. To me, it's so weird. Like the dog, the dogs out there, they're so friendly. Everything. It's weird. Well that was one of the things you said were you're talking about being able to take a wolf feel like I grew up with like straight pit bulls around. I knew how to handle myself in it. I mean you had to, you know what I'm saying? like usually like sometimes you had to kick him and run and kick them in the legs and they limp, you know what I'm saying?

Speaker 1:          02:45:37       So you had to, had to maneuver sometimes. Sometimes. I used to outrun them. It's tough but it's like I'm, I mean I'm new to the whole dog thing so I got a dog, I've got a husky was, I used to be fearful of dogs, like not fearful in a sense. Like I was scared it was gonna kill me. Like I just didn't want to have to fight the dog. Like it's not, it's not in me. Right. So that's a crazy thing to have to worry about. Like it was every bit that I got, I got bitten in the face when I was seven. Yeah. So like my uncle, he was staying with us at the time and he had dogs and for like two weeks I never had a problem before. I was like eight. I never a problem before, so I was back from school

Speaker 2:          02:46:10       and a sudden like I woke up just happy and I hear her and I was like, you know, it was me, like, you can't talk to dogs. So I was scared as shit. And so like I woke up and he just asked me saying ever since then kind of dog.

Speaker 1:          02:46:25       Well, yes. German shepherd, bite kids, man, those dogs bite kids. When I was a kid, my aunt got bit by a german shepherd. She got a face fucked up by a german shepherd. I'm a, I know two or three other kids that have been bitten by german shepherds. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          02:46:41       It was weird, man. And so ever since then, fuck I don't, I didn't, I didn't fuck with dogs at all. Like I hated them. And then we had this one pit that I got swept the like dog. I walked by your fence every day, like get it, get it together, man. But lIke I used to run from him rum from so many different. You know what, it probably became a game for him privately

Speaker 1:          02:46:59       many different times. You walk by and still couldn't get you on one day. Motherfuckers gonna come by and I'm going to kinda figure my way through this so I'm going to get them. I got nothing else to do.

Speaker 2:          02:47:08       This one I found out about dogs. So I finally was like, I was 29 years old. I was like, I got to get over this fear. Like I gotta get up gotta, get a dog and see what it's all about. So I got a husky cutest little thing ever. And after awhile I started understanding the dogs more and you understand that they're really only pieces of shit if the owners are pieces of shit. And so like the dog directly reflects its owner. And so now I understand like growing up in the neighborhoods I grew up, nobody has time or money to care for the dog, like they should. So they're henri. Yeah, just like the people. Yeah. It's just like the people. So as president, what's your first move? A. Remember

Speaker 1:          02:47:49       I'm not going to be a vice president, but I'll be like, I'm gonna be in my cabinets to much a house of cards. Do you want to know? I'll be like, I'm the dude who got fucked up by the hooker, but I won't be involved in of that. No. Sean spIcer, that fucking dude here take the hits. He has to go up there and say, say the bullshit that he knows is not true. That's what I need you to do. You know what? I do do it though. I'll let the people know when I'm lying. I just wear a fake mustache. So I'll give the same press conference and I'll have a fake mustache. Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. But sentence the president is an alerting me of this important news. You know, the first thing I probably do, I probably pardon? People in jail for weed.

Speaker 1:          02:48:30       Oh, nothing to do with me being here and talking. Eat. But it's like, it's such a problem. It's such a problem. Yeah. The president pardoned chelsea manning, right? Didn't obama pardoned chelsea manning? He pardoned him, I think at partner commuted her sentence. Yeah. So pardon means you're exonerated of any guilt, whereas community your sentences just so he's allowed to pardon a bunch of people that. Right. Does he have like 20 pardon or something like that? No. You get the most. I think there's a limit though. I don't think there's a limit. I thought it was like comps, like, you know, feel like you work at a comedy club. You get 20 comps on saturday night. My friends want to come to this

Speaker 4:          02:49:08       show. Good. Safe table. Nineteen hundred and 27. Go for him. Whoa. Convicted of federal crimes. Wow. Pardon? Commutation of sentence. Remission of fine or restitution and reprieve? No, he. He should have a list of the people. Listen to the people. Click the list. It's fine. To who? Alicia did side of chicago. Who's at two toolbox, mom?

Speaker 2:          02:49:33       No, no, she was, uh, she was uh, an activist back in the, when the black panthers were rising and she thinks she got political side of them and I think it was Cuba and the, I think it was the fbi was after this was in the fbi, was treating the black panthers like a terrorist organization and they were offering. They offer huey p, newton, and it was a big deal and a side issue. I think she's still on the run. Whoa. Where is she? I couldn't say. I think it's not pushy. Uh, what was, what were they accusing her of a that I couldn't tell you, man? Uh, there was, there's a whole bunch of conspiracies back then

Speaker 4:          02:50:14       little member when obama was running for president and they found out he was friends with a professor in chicago. That was one of the weatherman. I don't remember the weatherman was a documentary that I watched duncan trust. My friend called me up. Dude, you got to see this. It was crazy. They were taking acid and robbing banks and having orgies together. and I was like, what? Obama was known as the weatherman, it was this group, this radical group in the 19 seventies that was trying to overthrow the government and they were just a bunch of crazy people and they were doing acid and one of them wound up being a professor one day. Here it is bill ayers and the ninth and the 2008 presidential election controversy. So this guy was one of the members of the weathermen and he went from being essentially an antigovernment terrorist to me to be in a college professor.

Speaker 4:          02:51:12       And uh, it was a college professor, right? What does it say here? My eyes were way too shitty to read those. Trying to read what it says great. Confirms or denies, but it was a big deal. Yeah. It says here, the weathermen right there is a committee heading the weathermen starting at its creation the summer of 1969. The hippie movement has sort of a hippie movement, but another one of those, but a lot like a lot of those hippie movements. Hold on a second to claim that those three members of the weatherman who had died during the accident of explosion all assembling. Oh, they were trying to blow shit up, man. Jesus christ, project mayhem thing and a fight club. That kind of idea. Yeah. They were trying to blow buildings up and shit. So, uh, he apparently knew obama, so he was just like this real super radical lefty. Probably did some time. got out, became a college professor. I mean, did he go, did

Speaker 1:          02:52:05       he do time? Um, I'm trying to figure out to thing that how obama was connected to them. I think obama just knew him, you know, it was like one of those thinGs. Yeah. Mama contacts with ehrs, password bIking in the same neighborhood or something like, well, what is it? What's the big deal about that? I think there's more than that. I think they had some sort of a, a cordial friendship and there was a concern that he was connected to a guy that used to be. BuT the guy was free now. Right. So like what kind of mistakes of people made when they're 18 that you can exonerate them from when they're 50, you know, isn't there like a certain limit to the amount of time that you have to be? You know, I mean, can you be held responsible for some shit that you did when you were 18?

Speaker 1:          02:52:53       That's tough. That's the tough about the murder thing. Like weather underground, that's what they call themselves. That's not the weatherman. The weather underground. If you kill somebody at 16, 15 years old, like life, like I'm not. I guess it's just a tough subject because I was, I had this argument the other day like how subjective morality is and it's kind of all just based on super subjective life experiences and opinions will have a war subjective. You're allowing people to go over and do it and then you, you, you know, you slip them and say thank you for killing those people that have always been super affect cognitive dissonance about that. LIke it's, it's because we, we've, we've, we've normalized it to the point where you see where you hear casualty of war is a, it is a normal term, uh, but those are like innocent civilians being murdered sometimes, sometimes, and then there's the attitude that they have to die in order to serve the greater good.

Speaker 1:          02:53:50       Some casual observers have to accidentally be killed and some collateral damage. Yeah, that makes terrifying. It really is. Yeah. Well, the idea is that if we don't do that, we will lose whatever headstart on civilization we have over the rest of the way. just start all over how we do that. Oh no, It sounds right. That sounds like some people say after they smoke pot, I know we should be able to write, but how would we, what would we do? I feel like we got enough technology and enough smart people to just sit around and say, iron man, this ain't working. I totally agree, but I'm definitely have enough resources to feed everybody. Well, we certainly are close. I think we have. Yeah, I mean it's a matter of figuring out where to put it in whether or not we should be eating the same shit we're already eating because you know, if you look at all the different people that are living in this country eating corn products, just that alone, like why is that the case?

Speaker 1:          02:54:54       Like why is corn and so many different things. It's not because it's good for you, it's not because we're doing the best job arose in abundance, right, well you can grow massive amounts of it and these fields and the government subsidizes it and then it becomes a whole entangled sort of a system where the farmers are growing it and If they didn't have a subsidy from the government, it wouldn't be profitable. But it is profitable. And then the government, you know, they, they know that those places, they got to count on those folks when it comes to like elections and things along those lines. And I started going to mess. He gets entangled I guess. Messy man. Yeah. So do we have enough to feed each other with the way we're eating now? Yeah, for sure. But we shouldn't eat and the way we're eating now, so it's like, yeah, for sure we have enough food to feed people the way we eat now, but we should be eating like at whole foods.

Speaker 1:          02:55:39       It's like when you go to whole foods is like, oh man, you got to be registered shop here. Like why is that? It's food. It's fucking real food. Organic shit always. I don't really understand that whole thing either. Well, I mean it just means they don't have pesticides on it. right. Everything is organic. Phyllis, philosophically you can make. You can make that argument every short organic. Even if we tamper with it, we're organic. We're from the earth. Poisons natural. That's what I'm saying. Yeah. I mean everything that you make is made out of something on earth. So anything that's artificial or chemical or whatever the fuck it is still made out of raw materials that are found here on earth. I agree. Yeah. I mean some organic food is better for you probably because it doesn't have chemicals on it. And with the idea of gmo is where it gets real weird because almost everything is genetically modified.

Speaker 1:          02:56:28       My uh, my, my stepdad's when they hit me today, he's a geneticist. Oh yeah, yeah. Phd. He actually developed one of the firSt strands for the tyson chicken. And so he's like a bad ass to this making franken chicken, man. So what did he do? What did he do? I mean, I couldn't tell you how many chicken the fuck. I don't know what he tells us stories about how he like genetically modified. You can genetically modified chickens without feathers and all of this stuff. That's crazy, man. Oh my god. That gene spLicing shit is amazing to me. Have you heard, have you heard of crispr? That shit is so you. So you open that pandora's box of once you genetically modify human, you can't go backwards because they've already started to do with embryos in China. Really? Yeah. They're starting to do with non-viable human embryos.

Speaker 1:          02:57:18       So they're taking non-viable human embryos and they're doing all these genetic experiments on them and altering the genes. But the thing is, what it is now is it's like the baby steps towards something that will probably be just, it's going to be standard maybe 100 years from now or whether that's the next step in our evolutionary history. What is this? Jamie python breeder. Genetically bred a python to have an emoji on it home. Oh my god. I'm seeing it. I didn't see it. It's got smiley faces all over it. This is fucking insane. How did he do that? I just breed. I think you said it took like eight generations of breeding and can I can sell this worth 4,500 bucks and 40 it might. Might've been wearing initially. That's amazing. That's so cool. That is so cool. Looking emoji pythons as crazy. And that's crazy because that's just done through breeding.

Speaker 1:          02:58:12       Like like how to make a husky out of a wolf and that's done through breeding. But there's, you know what you're talking about chickens that don't have any feathers like serious science. So it goes deep, like to the point of like how far do you want to. How far the restraints of our, of our humanity and humanity is, so if you genetically modify humans to the point where, uh, you take out the genes that is the cancer gene and you take out the jeans and this and that and have that and to the point of we're living our health expectancy or the life expectancy goes up exponentially. Like, is it, would it be moral to not take those genes out of your kids? You know what I'm saying?

Speaker 1:          02:58:56       Here's a good question. And then yeah, the people that would be like, look, I know my kid's gonna have a disease, but that's what god intended. Like, whoa. For ns. To me, that shit is crazy. It's. but it's also debatable, right? The reason why. yeah. That's the reason why they have that opinion in the first place is because like, I guess you could argue it even if I don't agree with it. You could argue that opinion. And that's one of the weirdest things about people. There's just so much messiness to us when it comes to something like that, like some new technology. That's a crazy technology. You can make a super kid like you can make your kids seven feet tall, 400 pounds solid muscle runs through walls or make them a little pussy when you want it to be a pussy, whatever. They only have two models.

Speaker 1:          02:59:42       You know, if you have a prius or a mustang. Shelby, that's it. One of the two. What are you gonna do? Oh, we'll just take the prius. My kids just going to read a lot of books. Fuck that. My kids run through buildings now, man. I'm going to take the prius, man. Would you? Well, you already ran through building. My opinion. Skewed. Yeah. You should probably write a book on how not to play football and be a good book. It might not be a bad book coming from a guy like you. People would. People would definitely read it official. If maybe if I had to do again, I'd never played football. Yeah. Maybe that would be your book. see you started when you were seven. Man. How the fuck could, you know? That's what I'm saying. Like I had no, whose idea was it a, it was ours, so me and my brother was just like, fuck it, let's play football.

Speaker 1:          03:00:28       I mean, fine, You're fat, you're fat of it as a kid. And so to me it's fun playing sports is fun and it's fun to watch. Yeah. And so, but the comradery you got from it. Like I loved the life experiences like that, but it's just like I just feel like I have so much more to me than that and I just don't want to say wasted because it was a, it was a grand experience, but I just put so much time into my life that ended in an instant. You know what I mean? And it just feels like a lot of, I don't say wasted time, but it just feels like a lot of things I feel like could still be benefited

Speaker 4:          03:01:00       me to this day. I think so too. Now I'm going to say something, but whenever I say it, people get mad at me, but I have to say, you should start a podcast. I should start a pocket. fuck yeah, definitely should start a podcast. Don't you think so jamie? People like fucking rogan. stop telling. Interesting people should have podcasts. Your story's interesting. You know the whole thing thAt you're doing right now is interesting. Trying to figure out who the fuck you are and 30 years of age after being a famous football player and thinking you could fuck a wolf up with your bare hands. See, that's fascinating. It's not thinking she's going to jump on it right now to jump into five. Man. Now I've thought about it. Talk about some of them people, but it's like, oh no, you don't even have to do it like all the time.

Speaker 4:          03:01:45       You can do it whenever you want. Right? Like people are under no obligation to get it every day. It's not like you're forcing them to like, okay look, I'm going to sign the contract. Do you guys pay me x amount of money? I'm going to do this every monday to whenever you want. You do it on your phone. I'll show you how to do it on your phone. I guess I got a laptop, but I mean if you're somewhere. YeAh, like right now if we want it to set my phone down here, press the voice recorder and I'm telling you it sounds good. Like this ideA that you need like a lot of equipment to do a podcast and you've really not really. I mean it sounds better. You keep killing the game. Trying to stay one step ahead of the free and I walked into a.

Speaker 4:          03:02:22       I like this is just for podcasts. That's crazy. Well we'll just wait till the next one after we built studio dose. I gotta come back, man. Yeah, for sure. Free party world headquarters. We're having a party party world headquarters is where the next building as it's going down. that's good praise man. You would have the best doing it for show. Thanks man. You could do it for sure. One hundred percent. like you could do. Stand up too if you want to do that. You don't do that. Go man. There you go. Got it. The stand up thing. I know about the pocket brendan shops doing it. My friend brendan shop, he played. What did he play for? You got to play does preseason with the bills. I think as far as any fought in the ufc, he was on the ultimate fighter and the uh, fought in ufc, had some big wins I've seen now.

Speaker 4:          03:03:04       He has a podcast, a real successful to two podcasts fighter and the kid and he does this thing called the big brown breakdown where he goes over all the different fights that are coming up. So he went and now he's doing standup. So he went from fighting, like deciding like as a, as an athlete, like he was getting towards the end of his run, left fighting, and then now it's like way more successful doing this podcast and doing standup and doing live podcast shows so he could do it. And you talk way better than him. No offense books, man. I appreciate me under the bus. I was kid and he's, he's a funny dude, man. Brenda's really funny. He says hilarious shit. You can do it too, man. I'm telling. The beautiful thing about podcasting too is that you don't have to be anything like you don't. You could be funny or you could be smart or you could be interesting like you, whoever you are and just like that stupid

Speaker 1:          03:03:58       box on the ground at the la county museum of art. Like some people might. Some people might like that. No matter who you are. Some people. I'm not saying that you will be that box metaphor. Let's go with hot food. You are in amber box in your own right. I was. I should've gone with hot food. Hot food fan. I'm not a fan of that box, but I'm saying some people fucking hate hot food. right? I don't understand those. Yeah, man. He bring some people hot food. They freak out. TheY like like mashed potatoes. That's what they like. Mashed potatoes and boiled chicken. Boiled chicken. I like boiled chicken. Disrespectful. No, no, no, no. Soup. Chicken soup is boiled chicken. You got grill that at least first and then just know how to cook us. Usc. You will be a cook. I cook a few things. Do you low, but yeah. Where did that come from? That's last year. Well listen, here's what's crazy. That picture has been redone. Think about all the images on the internet is a beautiful place. There's one dude who's like, what does he deal with? Saudi original? No, I did.

Speaker 1:          03:05:05       Yeah, he's in Turkey. I thought he was in. He's cutting this steak and he's dealing with all this flare and every time he cuts it he slaps his knife on the table, but he does it with so much swag. Yeah, he's slicing through the. I bet this guy get so much pussy. It's not even close. Right? Because this is part of the reason. I mean this germinating the latin lover, romantic chef character. So he geTs to the end. He could just lay them out, but he. Yeah, and then he takes this it. He throws some, sprinkled some salt on it. That became that one thing. A guy sprinkling salt became a meme that just kept over and over and over again was man, it was black. Twitter. Was that what it was like? Twitter, black. Twitter is probably the most. That needs to be a documentary about that to be because it pushes so much of our culture.

Speaker 1:          03:05:57       It's a. Twitter does. Jamie says that people steal from black twitter, do it on like a tonight, show movies, not tv, show montages, snl, snl steals from the time it's not good. It's just hashtag black twitter. Just there's, look, I can't even get 100 percent. Explain what it is, but if someone's got to help me, I got you man. So how about did I get you? I get like five or six accounts to follow and you'll kind of get a feel for. Okay. And then, uh, I follow accounts that those people interact with. Yeah. And then you see like, so, so a lot of the content that you see, you know that Jordan cry face me like twitter. Oh, it's like they, they moved to man, I say a week and I'm on to it and I'm black. So I bought. It's, it's, it's ignorance at a very high level, but there's brilliant involved.

Speaker 1:          03:06:46       It's the coolest shit. What's the brunch of humor? The humor. Yeah, the, I mean, you know, as you know, any kind of like a lot of humans is his intellect, his intellect. And so the brilliance that comes from that. Is this the funniest shit? All right, I'm going to check it out. Jamie's very well educated. You know about blacks were kept for. So yeah, he buys yeezys. See I can never get them with jamie online. He's not on black twitter. No, he's not. He's, he's been ousted. He'll be rough. That'S my dude though, man. Well, they asked him and then he immediately Started producing it. Anti-trump record. he recognized what the fuck went down. He deleted all his pro trump tweets. All of them are gone and now he's producing some ant. A buddy hired who? You got another rapper like, hey man, how about you do this song?

Speaker 1:          03:07:32       He's helping the duty for him. He felt he felt it. He's, he's up there on a platform hovering over people saying he would have voted on trump yet craig. No songs, no songs properly at the propaganda. It's propaganda. Yeah, that's what he did. Deleted the tweet. Said fake news. I bet it's not fake news. Uh, but nobody wants to talk about it. That is reconsidering about Donald Trump. Kanye, kanye. I thought you liked trump. I thought you loved trump, anti antitrypsin properly. It's called propaganda, but he didn't produce it. Did he have anything to do with it? I don't know. How did he. I think there's a bunch of white people scrambling right now to keep this money flowing. Tanya, kanye, kanye. That's usually the case, man. Listen, man. It's been a lot of fun. I really appreciate you coming down here. I'm glad we did it. I'm glad it all came out of something silly and props and neal brennan for setting this up and uh, thank you brother. Appreciate it man. It's reAlly fun to do a podcast. I would listen. You got to. Come on now. I'm on 100 percent.
