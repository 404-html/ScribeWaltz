Speaker 1:          00:00:00       Nodoz

Speaker 2:          00:00:05       motherfucker, my voice is froggy to like get them. Thank you for. I gotta go tenor. Okay, good tenor. Thank you for having me. We were talking about opera before we started the podcast and that I was saying that those people are like aliens, like what they can do with their voice is so far beyond. I kinda like I could look at someone doing a backhand spring and I was like, okay, I bet if I practiced for a long time I'd figured out how to do that. I would need some help but it takes some time but that doesn't seem insurmountable, but what I hear,

Speaker 3:          00:00:48       yeah,

Speaker 2:          00:00:49       I hear these fucking dudes or

Speaker 2:          00:00:53       I can't imagine it. That has to start with some kind of natural gift. I guess it's maybe it's just like getting them when they're really young and then developing those muscle ups talking totally out of my ass. But you know who used to opera saying Jim Jefferies did really. Jim Jefferies was like a legit opera singer apparently that crazy. I know Jim very well. I'm surprised I didn't know that at all. I didn't either thing he told me on the podcast, I thought it was coke guy. Got a family? No, he's a general. He used to sing opera and uh, apparently he had like, what was it, like nodes on his throat that he had gift cert polyps. Polyps. So you had to get surgery on his throat. A gym. If I'm fucking this up, I apologize. But uh, he had to get surgery in his throne and killed his singing short is opera career.

Speaker 2:          00:01:42       Well, I don't know if he really wanted a career in it and who's doing some acting stuff and shit too. I mean he's a guy like, you know, he's like this, he's, he's at his best doing stand up. Everybody wants to chase other shit on top of the stand up. Sure. But when it comes down to it, like the standup is the most fun, it's always going to be the most fun, you know that. And I do think radio in a capacity as. Oh yeah, there were similar, like a similar beast. Well, what this is cool is like it allows someone who's not near us to have a good time talking to a guy like, you know what I mean? It's like, no, absolutely it does. It brings people in. You know, your is great. I think. I think it feeds the same beast as comedy.

Speaker 2:          00:02:28       It's also when you're live it's like immediate reactions to like as soon as you're done you check social media or anything and people like the feedback is immediate. Just like when you're on stage, you know? Yeah, there's definitely that. Definitely that aspect of it. But it's also cool aspect because it allows people to kind of work out ideas, workout ideas in the sort of open forum, you know, talk about stuff and it's. So. There's so many different places that people don't do that though. They really just stick to the 25 minutes they were so on and just do forever. Yeah. Well as far as standups. Yeah, that's brutal. I mean that used to go across the board. I was such a fan of comedy growing up, but I remember like you'd see people in like five, six TV shows and you're like, Holy Shit. Like I know their act.

Speaker 2:          00:03:12       Yeah. That was a problem in the early days, right before the early to mid. Like I guess like all through the eighties. I think in a weird way, def jam really did like make comedy, have to step his game up across the board, not as a comedy on that was always that great. But I mean like it brought it back until like, you can't just be like, you know, standing there with your blazer sleeves rolled up and, you know what I mean. You might have to like just show a different version of comedy act. Really attacking the people with it, doing comedy at people. Yeah. There's a few examples of that, right? Like, Kennison was definitely an example of that. Kennison came out. I remember, um, I've probably have told this story. I apologize. Have you heard anybody listening? But, uh, I found out about Kennison through a girl that worked with.

Speaker 2:          00:03:55       I was 19. I was working at the Boston athletic clubs, like this little health club and that was a teaching people how to lift weights and shit. And uh, this girl who worked at the front desk was hilarious. She was just like big volleyball check. She was like six feet tall but fucking hilarious. She was like, she had gotten into standup. This girl was really funny and she was a fan of standup and she knew that I was a fan of standup too. So she told me about this guy who was doing this bit about these dead people getting fucked in the ass. She said, she said his name is Sam kinison and how she did the bit she laid on the Sam candidate had an all time classic bit and it was about a homosexual. Necrophilia acts was about gay guys are paying to fuck dead bodies and she did the bit in the parking lot of the athletic club. She got down on her stomach and she was like,

Speaker 4:          00:04:42       oh, life keeps fucking in the ass even after you're dead. It never ends.

Speaker 2:          00:04:48       And she made me laugh so hard that I couldn't imagine what this guy was like. So he was like a mythical creature by the time I saw him on a vhs tape, I got a hold of a vhs tape. He wasn't even like, I don't even think blockbuster was around then it was like this little mom and pop places or places that had a name that I don't even remember. I got a vhs tape of Sam Kennison and I remember going, Holy Shit. Like, this is comedy too. Yeah. Whoa. Yeah. He was. So yeah, for me that that person was dice. I always say he was the guy where I was like, oh, this is. I loved stand up comedy and like this is a different thing. It's funny, my dice is, you got to watch him age from like a young guy to like where he is now.

Speaker 2:          00:05:28       We lost Sam Kinison so young, but he always looked 40. Like Sam kinison never looked here. You always have like a 40 year old, like your uncle who will come over. But his star appearances were like legendary. Well he was. He just went for a man who was such a pioneer. It's, it's hard to imagine, but all guys like us, like those guys, if it wasn't for them, we will be so far behind as far as like what we can and can't say what we can and can't get away with what, what is and isn't taboo and what,

Speaker 5:          00:05:58       what and also the, the, the recognition that when someone's saying something fucked up like that, he's, he's doing it for humor. That's it. It's no different than someone making a movie about someone shooting people. They're not actually killing people. Like it's not like the intent behind it. Intent behind it is humor and entertainment, which people do have to get a grip on better. But I also think that like, even like that def jam version of comedy should pay more homage, I think to like Sam kinison dice very much because that was like, to my knowledge, we're the first braggadocious comedy. Most comedies brooded in such like self deprecation with dice, but Sam kinison till was never a belly. He never talked about being like a big fat guy or it was always outward. Yeah, I know, I know the answers and you idiots got to listen to me and dice was more of like, you know, how great he is and everything, but that is like, that's the, I think the main difference between like that black circuit comedy and like the mainstream circuit because the mainstream circuit is not white comedy, but the black circuit comedy is its own kind of beast and that still has all the, you know, I got a big old Dick and I'd be choking the bitches with it because one bitch last night and you're like, wow, who are you relating to?

Speaker 5:          00:07:14       All these black people in the room. Well it was also the rap culture, which is very braggadocious as well, you know? Sure, yeah. There's like a bunch of things going on, a bunch of different elements, but for sure just as the art form for the art form as a whole dice is super important and kinison and super important. Yeah. Because both those guys came out with like really controversial acts. There was a lot of blowback, there was a lot of like a. and if you could listen to some of the stuff like that era, like some of the stuff in the eighties, it's really homophobic. Oh yeah. Yeah. Like in a mean, nasty way, which is where I always seen it for sure. Yeah. But we don't do gay jokes like that anymore. Like gay jokes today or like it's kind of a geek. It's, it's sort of wrapped around the idea that you could completely accept someone being gay, but it doesn't make it not funny if a dude is sucking the dude's Dick.

Speaker 5:          00:08:05       No. Yeah, exactly. Funny Concept. Yeah. No, without a doubt. I think people are coming. I think we're actually leveling out where now the pc police are running rampant of course funding. But they are funny. But they really, uh, the best point is like the person. You're joking, supposedly offending rarely offended that person. Right. It's always a white college girl who wants to like write a blog. Yeah. Well that, it's also the choosing to be offended recreationally. You know, that this is something that's a hot topic. So you know, this big Jay Oakerson guy eats. I'm going to take him down a peg. I keep after him. I can't fucking believe. I've never had blowback at all. I'm just probably. My name's not out there enough, I guess, but there's comics like a little lower down the totem pole than me. They just happened to be performing at a night where there was a blog writer and that goes viral and that becomes a whole thing.

Speaker 5:          00:08:55       But, um, I've never, I've had some like viciously offensive jokes, but I think that, um, again, there is, there is a weird x factor to comedy. I've talked about this recently too. It really is. I've got on stage and said horribly heinous things, right? There's somebody who just got oozing. All is like the most benign jokes, like the crowds too much. I've said terrible things and those same people are laughing. It's just like, it's a lot of that is a process. Not even talent. I'm talking about very talented guys getting a weird reaction for something not dirty or offensive at all. It's just, there's a, some people when you get on stage, there is an organic thing where you don't like Kurt Metzger, who's brilliant, brilliant comic. Like I honor his jokes are the testament to how good his jokes are is that he kills because they don't like him when he gets on stage, like right away he just like, whatever it is, they just don't want to like um, a Mike Vecchio is on the great comic but looks like a state trooper, you know?

Speaker 5:          00:09:52       So when he gets on stage, I think people are kind of like, who's this asshole? For some reason I think when I get on stage people are like, oh, I want to like this guy. I think it's like my game to lose almost. Well that's an intangible. It's something you could learn going. You're an easy going looking guy. He looks like you're a guy that be fun to hang around with, you know? Yeah. People actually think I'm much more liberal than I even am with certain things. Oh really? I mean I'm liberal overall, but I mean like, I'm not like I think people will be like, I've had a lot of people might just pull out coke in front of you start doing coke and I still get like a man that's drugs. That's why we get a reaction like that. That's not a liberal thing though.

Speaker 5:          00:10:29       Right. That's just A. I'm just saying, I think people just think that I'm much more like, you know, that I am and I'm really like a, well you wouldn't be getting anything done. Yeah. You know, that's the problem when you're doing as many gigs as you're doing and then you're doing legion of skanks and you know, you just recorded a comedy central special. If you were really just doing blow all the time, none of that shit would get done. But so many people have done blow all through. I mean I don't think Kennison ever stopped and he's got a couple of specials. Well, he supposedly did for a while and then they tested him when he was dead and he had coconut system and they'd said he'd done some coke when he got married because he had apparently just got married. Yeah, I think that's the story, but the story was they tested him and he had.

Speaker 5:          00:11:13       He had done some. Dice is super straight always right? Yup. Pretty much. He likes edible marijuana now. Helps them go to sleep. Oh yeah. Yeah. No, I know. I know. Yeah, I know he's like a weed guy, but I local guy dices a new dice though that's almost like now. I mean when he was like the height of like, you know, the John Travolta hair and the whole thing like that was a, I think it was super straight. Yep. Just smoke cigarettes. That's it. Yeah. And then for awhile he used to take a cigarette on stage with them and not smoke it, you. And then he said fuck it. And went right back on stage. At one point he just let it one day. I think so, yeah. I think it happened at the store. Ms Dot [inaudible]. I still oddly just have never met him. Oh really? Yeah. That if

Speaker 2:          00:11:54       I just say that's like my comedy hero in so many ways. Oh Man. I had just assumed that you knew him because you were at the store all the time. Dude. Fuck, you're leaving tonight. Yeah. Uh, well I would love. I would love to set that meeting.

Speaker 5:          00:12:06       It was funny when a Ari was at my house, here's my house for Thanksgiving, like maybes last Thanksgiving and made a bunch of people were smoking weed in my bedroom and including him. Everyone that was there was like eight people in a circle and he gets a phone call and everyone's kind of in their own conversations, you know, two people at a time and he answers his phone and he goes, oh, hey, dice and I ever. No one is paying attention, but I'm like, wow, that's crazy. He's like, yeah, dice. Okay. Like almost like annoyed by it, right? Or whatever it is. So I start just doing a dice impressions like about Thanksgiving. Oh Hey, are you having enough fucking Turkey? He'll con and a good goddamn do it all day. That's really good. Um, Gary and uh, no one's laughing. I keep doing it. Then people start making weird faces at me and then hours later we're just kinda sitting around and I go, that's so crazy.

Speaker 5:          00:13:06       That dice just calls you already. And so everyone was like, dice called you and I'm like, did you guys just think I was just doing weird dyson pray? That's what I was looking at me. Weird. They just didn't know that. Always on the phone with them. So they started broke into like loud, obnoxious, like interrupting conversations. Do your act. Hey everyone. Troy a Turducken you'll fuck. Have you ever done them on stage? Dice? You do. You should do dice on. Um, I think, but maybe I can pass it, but I fuck it up. Yeah. I love the easiest thing to do. It was, it was the bonding of me and my stepfather when I was like 12 years old. He let me watch, uh, the one he did the Tla dice man cometh. Wow. And I just thought it was like I went to school the next day and I was so much funnier because I was just regurgitating like his shit, like saying what he said. I just thought it was the greatest thing ever. Then we just had tapes made its way around all my friends

Speaker 2:          00:13:57       of his first cassette and I listened to it in the car with this girl I was dating and we were fucking howling, howling, laughing. I couldn't believe how funny it was. And so like to be friends with them now and hang out. So surreal

Speaker 5:          00:14:11       still knows the uh, he so good. There's so many different levels of standup, you know, like have the skill of it. I mean, and he's so good at the comedy of words. That's what I've tried to learn from him. Just picking the right word. Like the one who got me on this last thing was just like, I heard a lot of the jokes already that he did, but like, and then he just goes in, this chick's down their club or in your balls.

Speaker 2:          00:14:33       Clobbering such a great word to pick their. Well he is also, he's deiced too, so it's like you come to the show wanting that. Yeah, I mean it's its own thing. It becomes a, like Mitch Hedberg was sort of like Mitch Hedberg had a special thing like you would, you would hear his jokes and coming

Speaker 5:          00:14:52       from him like you couldn't imagine them coming from anybody else coming from him. They were hilarious and that's sort of the same with dice. Like anybody else that would say that you'd be like, what? When he says that it's just, he's just got that thing down and you know what that thing is when you go to see him. I think every special starts with the formula of like, so I'm doing this thing with some chick in a place where it shouldn't be happening at a time. That's weird. So everything starts off. It goes, you know? So I cut the throat fucking this broad because you know what it's like when you're a board in Anaheim at Burger King on Valentine's Day. A tag on like another like, but it's just like I want to hear every one of them. Yeah. And you look forward to it like it's a.

Speaker 5:          00:15:37       and here's the thing about Ford. Fairlane was great. I loved Ford Fairlane. I don't remember it honestly. But here's the thing about dice that's like about his act as opposed to everybody else's act. You want to know the jokes and you repeat them like with those nursery rhymes. He Ha. He tapped into some weird rock and roll thing where people would come to the show. What's in the fucking place? Inter rubbed. It was like killing the harder. You couldn't kill any harder and it, it, uh, it gives you the thing where it's like where you say it's rock and roll was in Rockford. Nobody wants to go hear the band. You love through the new songs. They want him to do the jokes. They know. Yeah, exactly. If a band has a new science, the trust sneaking in between hits people like, Oh, what is this?

Speaker 5:          00:16:25       I still get excited when I listened to dice rules ever because that was the second big specialty garden. And he goes, you guys studied and learned the poems? He was. But I wrote some new poems and it's like, it's like 20 years ago now, you know what I mean? So it's like, here's the new poems. It's like, I thought these are still the old poems, but they're so. They're so bad day. The laughter died is so brilliant. Oh, the data left who died, if you've never heard it, folks, one of the best comedy cds ever, and one of the most like revealing of what a real comedy show can be like. It's so great. It just has to go on spotify and listen to the track and our back. That's one of the funniest things I've ever fucking heard in my life. He, um, he went to, I actually had a cool opportunity to speak to Tony, who's the owner of danger fields.

Speaker 5:          00:17:16       It was rod these partner and that's where he did it. He said dice came in on a Tuesday at the sun or the older Tony? Older Tony. Oh yeah. He told me that. I'm totally cool with Andy Kaufman story too. That was never a fan of his. But it's pretty funny story. But uh, he said dice wanted to come in on a Tuesday, no announcement, whoever's there, like late night on a Tuesday and just recorded an album. And they said, yeah, they didn't make any announcement. He came and he said it was like, I think the biggest, he said it was like 20 some and the lowest it was 18 people and he

Speaker 2:          00:17:50       just went in there and started like talking shit to them and they were not interested. They didn't know he was coming. He just bullied

Speaker 5:          00:17:59       crowd. He just, and he just makes up a phrase an hour back. He goes, I'll give you an hour, an hour back. And then he just keeps going,

Speaker 2:          00:18:08       get it. He says,

Speaker 5:          00:18:11       get it like 50 times the thing. And then he goes, you don't even know what you laughing at. He says to them, they're stupid for laughing at like, you know, they're not laughing all those jokes. And he just keeps borrowing this thing into their head and they start laughing.

Speaker 2:          00:18:25       Well, you should point out to the, at the time he was selling out arenas. Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. So dice is such a maniac. He makes this album when he's selling out Madison Square Garden, he's selling out the Nassau Coliseum. He's selling out gi and places like I think to this day it's like Kevin Hart and him. I like the biggest. As far as like the most successful John Kevin Hart's done like 60,000 seat places and say yet. I mean he's, he's, well, what's the new trailer? Philly? It was like $60,000 of travel

Speaker 5:          00:18:55       now. What's next? It's insane. I mean, he's a insane. Literally. And I said I think I toys for his phone bill or electric bill. One point was in my name because he was so like he asked me if I could put it my name. They we're going to turn the electricity off. Wow. Back in Philly. That's crazy. Holy Shit. Yeah. Like nuts where he's at now. Wow, that's crazy. It's great. My Mom's still has no scope of that at all. Sugar out in La. She goes, tell Kevin we said how I'm like, I'm probably going to see him. He's probably in Bulgaria doing a fucking covered by bodyguards via riding a wave of diamonds, wearing his own sneakers. I had a genuine a bum out, like I felt bad about it too, and it was before I was having a rough go. I was headlining the Sacramento Improv or punchlines Sacramento punchline, which I love that club and I was headlining it and I felt pretty good about headlining it.

Speaker 5:          00:19:47       I'm like, you know, seven show week or whatever it is, but I'm like, this is great. I'm headlining the punchline. Sacramento. Kevin was in town doing the Arco arena where the Sacramento Kings play. Oh my God. He goes, hey man, come to the hotel and hang out. I go, absolutely, and I go to the hotel were outside for 30 seconds, but I get the hotel. He's coming out of like the hotel gym. It's like around the corner and I meet him and we're walking to the hotel and this 100 foot walk car stopped. People pour out of buildings. People start yelling and screaming. He turns around and gives him one way. If we go into the hotel, we go up to his suite. That is amazing. It's got a whole bunch of his boys there. They're playing a xbox three 60 time it was, and he goes, you want to watch the, um, used to watch the intro for my special, right.

Speaker 5:          00:20:38       It was not. This one's out now, the one before where he's got the pyrotechnics going off. He's like, yeah, we got pyro and it's going off. He's showing me this crazy, like insane trailer for it that's just like mind blowing. And I was feeling so good about, oh, I'm sorry. I should preface this story by saying, um, when I was talking to the cab driver bringing me to calves hotel, he was like, what are you going from a hotel to a hotel for? And I go out, you want to hear the story is pretty. I said Kevin Hart's here and um, uh, he's all buddy of mine, so I'm gonna go hang out with him. He's a gaggle. Yeah, I'm in town. I'm a comedian too. I'm playing the punchline. And he goes, oh, that's amazing man, because can I get tickets? And I was like, yeah, I could like put you on the list for some tickets if you want to show you when it comes to shows and there's somebody goes to shows at the argo arena.

Speaker 5:          00:21:29       And I was like, oh no. He goes, Oh, I'm sorry man. I thought he said I want to take it to Kevin Hart show. I was like, okay. He asking you for Kevin Hart's tickets. So that's how that starts. That's how this thing starts. And he gives me his card, this cab driver, he goes, call me when you're done because I'll be right in the area. Okay. I go up. So kept showing me the pyrotechnics. Yeah. Do you want lobster? We're all getting lobsters and shit and I'm not even exaggerating. It's like this Kinda hang and I'm like, this is fucking crazy. And uh, and his buddies are all playing the xbox and I said try to find some sign of like old Kevin there, you know what I mean? Not, not that he's, he hasn't, just personalities, not shitty or anything, just like, you know, connect on some level of what our friendship is.

Speaker 5:          00:22:16       I'm like, you still bring your xbox everywhere highs. I still do that too. I pack it up in a like Schlep it with me everywhere I go so I could do something during the day and he goes, oh no man, because every time we land we sent a guy out to buy an xbox for the day and then we leave it for the maids. And I was like, I gotta go. I left like in a weird short amount of time and the guy picked me up in the cab and we're driving back to my hotel and he's me this question like, how was it man? How was it was fine. I'm like, I, I wasn't that in when like a contest to meet. I'm like, I know. He's like, Oh man, he's so funny. That's great by the way, because I feel like a dick. I'm, I'd love to.

Speaker 5:          00:22:55       If the offers still up, I'd love to come to one year shows this weekend. I go, yeah man, absolutely. Let me know. He's like, my wife would love it, man. He goes, I'll bring her out because I looked really cool. I'll be like, hey, I know the comedian stuff and I'll be like, yeah man, whatever you want. So it's just a before get out of the car, just tell me what show would show you want to go to and we pull up to the hotel but you know, it's kind of a quiet 15 minutes ride and I'm getting ready to go. So hey buddy, what's your name? So I'll put you in for tickets. He goes, honestly man, I'm not going to come. Why do you keep building me up to hurt my feelings? Let them fuck them going out of his way. Yeah. That was the saddest. Like, and I was headlining the punchline. I was excited and I was. And then all of a sudden I was like, Jesus man, I either call like I've made phone calls back home, like why am I so like just fucking awfully green with envy. I

Speaker 2:          00:23:46       just showed it all over my ass in that room. You just, first of all that cab driver wasn't helping anything that kind of put you in a weird state of mind. He was an idiot. So you went, you went to Kevin's place, you were driven around by an idiot and you're going to see the most successful comedian of all time. Who is your friend who you helped with? His electrical bill and you get in there and they're thrown away x box. I got to assume you're a high as fuck, right? Will you hide when you went over there? I maybe had to be there. Those guys aren't really doing anything like that. But you probably did before you went over there for sure. Right? I know I would. Yeah. That scared the fuck out of me to ranch. I got to get away from him.

Speaker 2:          00:24:24       So I just had a meltdown. I'm like, hi. They go, well, you know, he's. I don't understand how a guy like that couldn't work as much as he does. Being meaning, I don't know. Not that I don't understand that these, that ambitious. I don't understand where the time comes from. Several is several movies I think still coming out. Well it's a, it's also stand up and it's also. I mean he's just on top of it. Social media is social media is like a business to him. It's a really interesting guy, man. Like super, super awesome.

Speaker 5:          00:24:53       Well, the new, uh, the new trailer for the, for the new special says he goes, uh, comedies first ever. Mogul gas sort of. I guess so. I mean for sure. Well, whatever. Who gives a fuck about first ever this or that he's about to say. But what other comedian was a mogul you think was a real, like Jerry Seinfeld running a bit. The, the branch. I mean, Kim's got sneakers. Does he? He's got Nike sneakers. Yeah. Oh Wow. Yeah, I would assume. I would say he's the first. Well, he's first of all the quickest ascent of stardom. If you look at him like to where he's at, where he's at. I mean there's. So it's me and him, it's almost 18 years. How long has he been famous for? Ten years. Household. He's been known from about, without exaggeration, five years in [inaudible]. He was working like a lot, but he didn't even, he didn't even move to New York.

Speaker 5:          00:25:52       Me and him and Keith Robinson would go up to New York every day and uh, he never had to move to New York. He jumped right. He got the Montreal festival, got a pilot with Judd apatow and moved to La. It was like overnight where he was in the business working, making money, you know, surviving. Well, I'm sure there were peaks and valleys in that, but I mean, I remember I did a show he hosted like beatty's one mic stands, like a comic view season. He hosted that, you know, at that point I'd say he was still like famous, like in the black community. He did, um, soul plane and all that stuff. But I'd say like a household name maybe like six or seven years now. But I mean, so think about that international world, famous gun from, but six or seven years to like these 50,000, 60,000 seat arena.

Speaker 5:          00:26:41       That's incredible. Isn't a um, I wonder if he had any doubt in his mind that data, they would fill that fucking room eagle, the Eagle stadium, but he's from philly and everybody knew it was like a big event. Yeah. You know, I think uh, I think he knows what he's doing. Obviously it worked, right. But I mean he's got, he's got the production things where he produces specials for other people. That's great and all that shit. So I don't know where a guy like that has that kind of time. So it seems, seems like I know how much I work and I'm like, God, this guy works like twice as much as me. How's it going know where you find the time to do this podcast? I mean really it's like, it feels like you're running around for UFC a ton and then it would have up.

Speaker 5:          00:27:23       Yeah. But the standup, is it night podcasts during the day? I don't have a real job. The UFC stuff like the stuff in studio where I do like countdown shows and stuff like that. That's the only like once a month, the events, they're not that often, twice a month, three times a month at the maximum. Then there's stand up in between. So it's not that hard. It's just appears harder than it is. It appears like there's more going on in there, but you know. But if you're doing a television show or even more so if you're doing a movie, you're fucking gone for 16 hours a day here. Committed, you know that that is the big. The big trap is the movie trap. I mean it's awesome if you want to make a shit ton of money, but it is not nearly as fun as doing standup. There's, I mean I think it be fun.

Speaker 5:          00:28:09       Yeah. I think. I think in general, I don't know, it was never a reason why I got into comedy, which just takes too much time. But the hold I did a scene a, me and Doug Benson and Louis j Gomez did a scene together for Jim Gaffigan show we, it was a 15 second dream sequence he has. And if we were there, I mean just the 15 second scenes. So they shot it even like eight times. How much filming that is. We were there for like nine hours, nine hours that day. Didn't do a thing. Got there at like 4:30 in the afternoon, didn't do a thing until 8:30. And you're just like, I don't understand the point of that. The laziest I ever got with my standup was when I was doing news radio because I was, when we first started out we were um, there was a lot of struggles in the beginning and when a show is trying to find its legs, you know, writing wise and story wise and the networks notes versus the producer's notes and all that shit has to get worked out.

Speaker 5:          00:29:11       We were doing like 12, 13 hour days. There were long ass days and everybody was exhausted and I would just do no stand up or if I did something I would do like a spot on the weekend and I wasn't writing at all because I was never going up. I did a show for two seasons on IFC channel and it was so like I was still no, not established enough in my mind in the clubs in New York that I would like really it was a killing myself. It was bad for her. Like I was still doing standup and I wouldn't go onto comedy central tool. That was back when the show is ran on the weekdays to like three in the morning. So I'd be getting home at like 3:30 in the morning and like sleeping til 5:30 in the morning going right to set. Oh I didn't do it every night I try to pace it like to be every other night.

Speaker 5:          00:29:57       So one that I'd go home and I'd fall asleep like right after filming which could be like 7:00 at night, you know, and just pass out for the night. So I try to pace it but I couldn't walk away from it enough. I just feel like especially in New York and they really let you feel like there's someone waiting to take your spot in a heartbeat. And there is. And there are three comics thanked me for being on the road so much now because it clears up some of the weekends. But you know what I mean. I, I get that. What was the show that you were doing? It's called Xerox on the IFC channel. It was fun. It was a, we, they kind of let me have the reins as far as like kind of telling them like what comics, like stamps, we should have like guest star on it.

Speaker 5:          00:30:33       But what was the premise? It was about a band called [inaudible]. They were a real band at the time. They, um, it's just their story. They played like they try to become rock stars at night, but during the day they would play kid's parties, like kids' birthday parties, which is a. So it was like a sitcom. Yeah, it was a half hour show, but it was a, what are they called? Like the single cameras, you know, whatever. Like Marin. Yeah. And it was um, it was fun because it was curb your enthusiasm style, scripted outline only. Oh, you can just make up your own lives. And they had a bunch of Maitland caplets. Patrice was on a few episodes. Geraldo got on a few episodes a why didn't get them all? I mean, but he was on a few episodes. I'm Geoff Ralston and episode Kurt Metzger rallies. It was, it was pretty crazy.

Speaker 5:          00:31:21       So tell, uh, tell. Acting is fucking so great and I couldn't make up his own lines to. Can People Watch those now? The other one. Amazon. What's again? Xerox. Xerox. It was fun show. It was just, it was, it was a little ambitious too. Like I said before, these guys were mostly read at the director of production team is mostly reality show guys. He, you would think that doing a show like that with a bunch of comics completely ad Lib style curby enthusiasm style is a great idea. You know what guys like Joey Diaz or it did well in the show actually did very well. It just like it was arguments between the production and the uh, network. Yeah. See it's always that way, man. It's everything I've ever done that's on television. There's been some arguments between the production and the network and it's always weird shit later.

Speaker 5:          00:32:09       Like why can't we have coke cans sitting facing camera on the show and was like, when I was on news radio is infuriating because you would watch these guys come up with these ideas about like we're going to bring in a love interest who want to do this and that, and the writers would get so pissed off to be like, look, this is a really good show. The, the fucking problem is you guys keep moving it from time slot to time slot, but then the network is like, no, we're going to do this or we're going to do that and we're going to bring a hot girl and we're going to bring in a hot guy and we're going to. It was just so goofy, so goofy to watch all these different people battle in a lot of the people that are putting in the input.

Speaker 5:          00:32:49       They're not professional creative people. They're executives. Yep. And then they have to take those notes. Seriously. I, uh, I used to get a note a bunch better, a pilot that I wrote my stop pitching it even because it was just getting so frustrated with my. We definitely wrote like a funny thing right here, me and to me and Lewis and Dave actually we wrote a funny thing that can be maybe stretched to movie length or a pilot. I liked it as a pilot. It was something to live in a world of like true stories that I have. Cause I said I used to do a job ironic with the xerox story, but a real job where I drove strippers, escorts around at night to gigs and then during the day the same company was I'd go dressed as like elmo to a kid's birthday party, so it existed in that world.

Speaker 5:          00:33:35       We were a really funny thing and then they just start saying things like having a strong female lead. I'm like, just fucking funny. I promise you there's women in the show. What about diversity? Big J. just like. Yeah, it's like one of the friends black or something. The most important thing right now. Big So ridiculous. Every body has to be completely and unique. Yeah. If it's a black show, you have to have a wacky way. You. Yeah. It's. Those kinds of conversations are very weird because there's nothing wrong with having a strong female lead, if that's what you wrote. Yeah. Whoever the person is, it's writing it or the group of people. You got to leave them to their own creative visions. As soon as you start saying, you know, let's have a black guy do this, so let's make this a Chinese lady like stop.

Speaker 5:          00:34:19       If you have a really funny person, like leading the charge, like a comic who was like, you wrote something and they have a picture in their head. That's kind of the confidence I've tried to build and stand up. Like I feel like if I say it like I'm trying. I'm trying to make myself laugh first and foremost. So if I say it, I think it's funny. I believe it's funny, right? I believe that I just like didn't convey it to you the right way. You know, you didn't get it fully or you're being tight. Asked about some other reason. You know what I mean? So it's like that. But they don't put that kind of faith like the networks never put that kind of faith in the complicated gill. If you make my vision with how I've seen this in my head, if you give me the tools to create it the way I see my head, it will be funny.

Speaker 5:          00:35:01       I think with day worry about is the consequences of anything that you might do that could fuck their career up. Absolutely. Green light a show and you go off the deep end with something completely ridiculous. It makes social justice warrior news, but you're one. Yeah, but I mean, you know, you like, you know something's good fast. I'm talking about just someone who's particularly me out of the picture. Just if you trust and someone that's genuinely funny, right? If you let Dave attell make, given the endless funds to make whatever his vision is, it's going to be funny. Well, that's what Louie did. Yes. Right. That's his show was exactly

Speaker 2:          00:35:38       that. That's why he directs it, produces it and everything. He was editing it all on his fucking laptop in the beginning. I don't know if he kept doing it that way, but she's as Christ, but that's why it was so good. I mean it's, it's a single vision. It's from his mind and so like the dice thing, louise got the Louis thing and you know what to expect when you go into watch the Louis thing, so it makes it even more funny. He knows exactly how to do it and when you watch that show that's like, it's so clear that that's right out of his mind. It's his perfect presentation of what his thing is, but that's never. That's such a rare story. Super Rare. It's super rare, but that's why television is not going to make it. It's just not going to make it. If it keeps going this way, it's just the only people that are doing it.

Speaker 2:          00:36:19       Right. Like comedy central. Take some crazy fucking chances. They take crazy chances with their roasts. I was at a roast battle last night. They took grazie chances with that. I mean that is a raw buck wild comedy clubs show. Yeah. No Shit. And comedy central apparently is going to air it. I was downstairs last night from that night, so I heard all the chaos. It was madness. It was madness. Fun though. Yeah. Oh yeah. Earl Skakel crushed when it gets Jesse Joyce. Dude, he crushed as hard as a person can crush. Really? A person can't crush any harder. He hit every note. It was like it was scripted. Oh my God. And then there was adlibs that were perfect to. It was. It was madness. He didn't have a shirt on. He threw water all over his head and threw the water under the crowd. Silver pants on the triple h entrance was the.

Speaker 2:          00:37:11       He had a fur coat. You tell me a fur coat on with no shirt and a silver pants. Oh. And he did it. He did it. Uh, what I judged a few weeks ago, he came out and did the trip go triple h entrance. He came out and like ran to the audience and climate on tables and water and threw it in the audience. Madman. He's a fucking madman. And so he'd beat up on Jesse Joyce, who has to help me write jokes for at midnight tonight. Well, just joyce is really funny. Jesse crushed him out of the box. Jesse crushed him out of the box. The first one was brutal. Who is a joke about him opening up for Rob Schneider, but then earl just opened them up and fucked his mouth. He just, I'll just, I'll just smashed him. It was crazy. It was so much fun though. It was Dane Cook, Bobby Lee, me and Jimmy Kimmel was there too.

Speaker 2:          00:38:03       He didn't judge, but he was like in. They gave him a microphone and Jeff Ross running the whole thing and Brian Moses, who the perfect host for that thing. God Damn, that's a good show. So she could show me grow waves. Hilarious. Good. So good. Everything about that show. So good. It's the. It's the most wild show in all of La because there's a version of New York caught a roastmaster is at Lewis hosts and it's. It's like sanctions sanctions. Wrong word, but like Jeff Ross signs off on that one and they run it in like New York for some reason.

Speaker 5:          00:38:36       Some great rose, some great writing, like amazing actual battles talent wise. But it is missing that thing that like the, you know, the, the, just the insanity, the noises. I mean they have a Dj and he does his thing, but you know what I mean, like that room, it's like, it's like A. Yeah, if you guys know for sure. But it's also like everyone, everyone's just so in tune with it. Like it's not talking about that last night, like, uh, when was it, I forget who it was with somebody. Somebody crushed so hard that I was Jeff Ross and I were clinging to each other. We're clinging to each other because the joke was so fucking brutal. I don't want to butcher the joke. The suicide job. It was so goddamn brutal. We were like hanging on to each other. Like this is the only sort of environment where that would be even justified because everybody's completely smushed in there.

Speaker 5:          00:39:24       The belly room at the comedy store is only supposed to seat 70 people. They get 100 in their shoes and everybody's smashed in like this. And when everybody is smashed in, like this is. So there's doors, there's four different ways to get out. So it's not like a trapped, because like literally four different exits to Rome, it's an easy room to get out of. So it's not dangerous, but it's so intimate that when people laugh and they'd go, oh, like the people behind you a high, everyone's high fiving, everybody all squished in together. People like slapping people in the head and then when they're doing it in New York, it's going to be the grammercy theater, which is not intimate. Oh, he can't do that all. Yeah. I'm curious to see how that goes. You can't do that. That's Jeff's doing that. Jeff's version of it.

Speaker 5:          00:40:10       Oh, why didn't they do know the one in New York, the show they do. The biweekly show is actually is at the stand. That's actually a good room for that. So yeah, it's really small. But the one and uh, but the one for tv they're doing at the gramercy theater and that's. They always wanted to do. They always want to take something that's awesome when it's intimate and move it into a big giant place. The seller would be great for it. But uh, or even like they have the, a room or in the corner now to village underground. Yeah. Oh, I saw a video of you from there. Yeah, that's great. That looks like a very cool role and a good size stage to walk around on. It's very wide and long and they basically recreated the cellar down there, but it's just a bigger room.

Speaker 5:          00:40:52       Wow. It's like 200 people maybe. Oh, that's cool. And that's the same people. Same. Our new one called the comedy cellar still. Oh no shit. That's awesome man. I gotta check that. I don't want to get back there. That stage looked amazing. Like the setup of perfect. Oh, it tells you. Is it for several things. Used it for his hotels underground show. No Shit. And I think you'd use it now for a new thing he's doing. That's awesome. Bobby Kelly did a special there, I think. I think he did. Yeah, I think you're right. Yeah, it gets used. It's great. I got to check it out. Check it out through their live podcasts there. Oh, they do? Yeah. I didn't know they did it live. They just did one recently. It was there, been so stressed for a show in life. They had four girl calm.

Speaker 5:          00:41:34       I don't like turning over control. I like having control in the comedic situations and uh, we performed five minutes. It was like five or six, six of us. And then for girl comics, like just straight off your comedy, would they fuck you or not? Like they, they, you know, with, with comments about it. And I was like, I hated it. I was, I did well. I did fine, but it was like A. I'm actually hasn't worked out good for me really. But like going into it, I was like, I did not like that. I haven't felt that in a while where it's at now. I guess every night we're being judged, but like you do stand behind your wall of comedy. This just seems like they're going to tell me if they'd fucked me or not. Like no matter what my comedy was on pure looks, you know, it's interesting.

Speaker 2:          00:42:13       That wouldn't be something that you could do with a woman.

Speaker 5:          00:42:17       Hell No. That was the joke of it, I think. Yeah. No, you'd be there. Your blogs would be rolling.

Speaker 2:          00:42:22       Yeah. That's acknowledging that there's some sort of an imbalance in their approach. They. It's not that they don't want you to insult them and be sexist. They just, they want the exclusive right to do that. And when I say they, I mean only people that think that way. I mean you if you don't think that way, but a lot of people that think that's so cool. It's cool as shit on a guy and and knock you down by your looks and your five minutes of material. If a woman did that, like if you had a woman get on stage and tell a joke and a bunch of guys like you and me, we're sitting around deciding whether or not we would fuck this girl based on how funny her jokes were. There'll be brutal show.

Speaker 5:          00:42:59       Oh yeah. Well it's funny that the nerves have a show like that. Is that like if it got into some kind of like, you know, wit battle. Not that they wouldn't say funny things are shit on me in a funny way. I just feel like I could probably be meaner and probably make them more upset than they can make me. Well, you also have a lot more experience. More like what would that kind of thing, but just, you know, I mean just, but you should always just kind of like, you know, what it gets to the core of like, uh, making a woman pretty upset if you want to go for it. Yeah. And they with us also, but I'm just saying for some reason like were just a little thing. Not always, but I feel like just a little thicker skin. So just having the kind of take whatever.

Speaker 5:          00:43:34       And there was the comments like, but it was a fun show the other day, but I don't want to take the show down at all. I love rich and body. But um, there's comments that are like, you know, the backhanded like, you know, and I, you know, I've, I've, uh, I've fucked a few like, you know, fact guys before, so I could probably, you know, it was like, that doesn't bother me at all. So you're like, right. You know what I mean? Like that feeling, you're like, oh right. And it's like if I said anything remotely like that, yeah. Any of them. Like they'd actually might be a phone call later, you know what I mean? Like, Hey, what would you. It would be an issue for sure.

Speaker 2:          00:44:07       I mean I guess we could take it better. That's why, that's why it's okay. It's sort of like implied that their sensitivity is a bit more delicate.

Speaker 5:          00:44:16       Yeah. Ends. So you could take it looked at. I got four would fuck me. It's. Thank God. Congratulations. Thank you. That's beautiful. But um, but it's weird that pumps me up. But the thing is if it, if it goes bad, like I said, that's why the, the, the lack of control I meant was that like almost I have to keep my own control myself and you're like I don't want this to get where I don't have the crowd that turn because then I'm just going to be mean to these four girl comics, you know? And then it's going to be, it's just going to get ugly and I think are actually fighting. He actually got a weird, was one of the judges, I mean it wasn't like super bad, but like she added the gates was going to say no because like they just had such a weird back and forth.

Speaker 5:          00:44:56       Oh, they knew each other already. Oh yeah. We knew all. I knew all four girls but have been again, even though I know them, it's just a still a thing. Like you can't cross a certain line, you know what I mean? Like there's certain things you can't say. Yeah. Well that's one of the weird things about roast battles in general, but at least with rose petals are doing it back and forth to each other. This seems like you have to do your standup and then they shit on you. Right? You really, you really can't ship back too much. That's the problem. I mean not as bad as you would. I guess what I'm saying. You always have to be like Kinda like keep control over yourself. Made a good point in that it's a controlled environment. Like, so kate, like what you do, they set up these artificial time limits and rules.

Speaker 5:          00:45:34       Right. The artificial thing being not by artificial, but you know, they just decided five minutes stand up and then the girls get to decide and then they talk like this is the rules for the game and they set up but well, what is that then? Because really what you would do is you would just play it out as long as it's entertaining and if you were just going to play it out as long as it's entertaining and give you a microphone and give her a microphone. Well they did. They did. I mean I had a microphone for sure. I had listened to. There's options there to just haul if, if they, if they shit on you, you could definitely haul off on them. I'm just saying it's a position where it's like it's almost asking for you to get made fun of and then you're just kinda like, well alright.

Speaker 5:          00:46:14       But I really can't make fun of them back the way I would make fun of them. Yeah. Well I dunno. I guess I could do it, but I'm just kinda like these four girls who were like, you know, quote unquote friends for the most, some of them closer than others, but you're like, I don't want them to be all upset them. They'll say whatever they want to be and I'll let it roll off and who gives a shit, you know, if it stings for a second, it stings. But like these are phone calls later, you know what I mean? Where it's like, Hey, well why would you bring that up? That the thing you know about me? I'm like, I don't know. I thought we were swinging for the fences.

Speaker 5:          00:46:47       Yeah, man. I don't know. It's just a, it's a game. You know, you're playing a game and it's a fun game, you know, that's what it is. But it's, it is, it is kind of weird that you could never do it with a bunch of men judging women. No, no, no. It will be. I mean, you could, you probably could do it 50 years ago if he, if he could probably do it today. You know, you know that Mike favor man story, right? If you flip that story around just the guy girl roles in that one that goes like it goes nowhere. Nobody gives a fuck. I don't give a shit. No one gives a fuck. Girls could, you know, um, girls can make fun of a lot of things about a guy and it's totally different than the guy doing it about a girl.

Speaker 5:          00:47:24       I've got all my newest. A few jokes since special are rooted in respect. Like women, like I said, I, I, I'm all, I'm so pro women as far as the equal pay. And I said everything that they want to possibly do in the world, achieve all your goals. Just like a dude, I don't care. But like manhood is being stripped down big time. I mean, like I said, the example I use, it all came up from a speaking to my girlfriend and my buddy about UFC. It was a conversation with the three of us. I never knew. My chick thought this way. She goes, I'm doing, but the UFC guys house together. They did that whole documentary about the domestic abuse problems running through now and my girlfriend goes, oh, I would never want to date a guy like that. Like if he could just like, lose control, like he just beat the shit out of you and it's like I could beat the shit out of you.

Speaker 5:          00:48:18       Control. Do you, are you, do you think that I can't do that? Like why would you say that to me in front of the friendly. Of course they can beat the shit out of you. I just don't do this. Like she thinks she's at. She would have a shot. Yeah, I think there really isn't going to affect. Oh, just dumb guys. You know, Reagan used to have that great fucking joke by the commercials, you know? And then the guy's like stuck in the mini blinds. Like how do you work this crazy thing? It's like, my husband's so stupid. That's why I have pop tarts. Joker ethic isn't like you really think that manhood is being torn down though? I think uh, yeah, I think masculinity is like attacked more than anything. Probably.

Speaker 2:          00:48:59       I think it's attack, but I don't think it's effective. I think that I don't think it's having an effect on whether or not things are still masculine. It's real problematic for two reasons. One, because it's okay to be really feminine, so if it's okay to be really feminine, why is it not okay to be masculine? Like there's a big difference between being masculine and being rude, being mean, being homophobic, but they are. They shouldn't be. They shouldn't be. No, they shouldn't, but I'm saying, but they are in that regard, so that's what I'm saying though. It's like being pretty and feminine doesn't mean you're a cunt who stuck up. Sure. Those get lumped together too sometimes too, but that's just dummies and it's the same dummies that are attacking masculinity for just being masculine. Like here's one of the. This is this crazy fucking phrase that these dummies like to throw around lately.

Speaker 2:          00:49:46       Regressive left. People like to throw around this phrase, toxic masculinity and they're blaming toxic masculinity on this guy. Shooting up that gay crowd in Orlando. This was this article and they were using the term toxic masculinity. That's first of all, that's not real. There's no, there's no amount of being masculine makes you toxic. Yeah. Okay. And there's nothing. If you're a shitty, nasty person has nothing to do with masculinity. If you're an evil person, obviously it happens at mass shooters are almost exclusively men. Yeah. But that's not toxic masculinity. That's a fucking psychopath. That's what that is. It has nothing to do with masculine or feminine. It's not gender determined. That guy was already chemically off and then he was like a, you know, a repressed homosexual by all accounts. Yeah. So it's like you can't. Yeah, that's not, that's nothing to do with masculinity.

Speaker 2:          00:50:43       So was the guy, they call it la apparently the guy that they caught in la who had one of his way to the explosives. Yeah, an arsenal in his car. They caught him on his way to the gay pride parade. Apparently he is allegedly bisexual as well. I think there's a pride parade, crazy fucks out there in this world and to start breaking it down by gender or masculinity and femininity, it smacks to me of like some sort of ulterior motive. And I always feel like the ulterior motive when you see these guys were writing these articles, they're weak people, they're not, they're not like powerful forces of genetics. They're weak people and I think a lot of times weak people they want in some way or another to even the playing field in one way to do that is by pulling down examples of masculinity that they can't possibly approach.

Speaker 2:          00:51:32       Well there's, yeah, there's a type of guy. Exactly who stands behind the feminist issues, like really like vehemently like bitching at some guy. Exactly. It's called virtue signaling. Somebody gets that man. If you like it, you know, a joke or something that you say were you included were like, oh these dinky broads over here. And they go broads really brilliant. Like dude, like, come on, fuck off. Yeah, just get Outta here. I know what you're doing there. Just the virtue signaling phrase that Michael Shermer uses is a great one. He's got this interesting point of view on. It is like what they're doing is they're just trying to let everybody know that there are more ethical than you. They're more moral than you. They're a better person than you look at me. Look at me. Yeah, exactly. It turns it on there. They're just looking for.

Speaker 2:          00:52:18       Even if they don't even, they probably don't even know whether or not it makes sense. They just know that it's an effective stance to take to look like a super progressive person. So you just go after it. You go after the hardest levels of it. Yeah. There's a lot of people like that. These days they're doing that. It's because of social media. It's given morons and opportunity to blurt out and to get reactions from their blurt outs, even if they haven't really thought them through and they're almost always exclusively insulting and mean and nasty. So these people that are trying to proclaim their virtue, they can't even like argue a point while being just a decent human being. You can't even like say what you feel about something without being some sort of an insulting, like nasty, condescending, defining that. Define you like big Jay. You're a sexist piece of shit. Like Tj, I said the same thing where it's like, you know, clap for handicapped people. Well, you know what? I mean like it's the same like, uh, you're supposed to feel a certain way about something and it's always attacked like whatever it is. It's what you're saying, right? He's like,

Speaker 5:          00:53:27       am I getting that wrong? No, I think we're both too high for this conversation, but I know what I'm saying. Just it's, there's, there's some sort of like dishonest communication that's happening with some of this. I think a lot of the outreach is not real. I think what a lot of it is they're acting outraged because they know they can. Of course it's not balanced and it's also what I'm saying is it's really shitty and insulting. Like when you get to a point of view on something and there'll be really shitty and insulting about you and your point of view, like an intelligent rational person that's examining the thoughts and words of someone that they're not involved in a conversation where they come to you and say like only a racist would say something like that. They define you and some sort of a weird way. If you have a point of view that they feel like they can attack or you start with that one, I'd say if you say a a bad neighborhood or even black people know you're talking about a black neighborhood, that's a racist to say it's like as black people, if that's a racist thing, it's just kind of a thing, but it's that. It's never. I've never been called racist or or massages.

Speaker 5:          00:54:32       Massages. I've been called by a woman before but never been called racist by any one of color of any sort. Well, congratulations on that as well. So you've got four flux use. You're not a racist. That's beautiful. Oh No, but I'm saying I've been called. I've had people get really upset with like racist jokes or anything. They've deemed racist. Right. It's always like a white paper. It's like the same point, dude. Yeah, yeah. Or, or, or, or a woman with a guy behind them going like, yeah, Kurt Metzger gets into those things all the time. Was a guy behind him, but backing up some stupid point I, I get, I got a bunch of shit for coming against the naked shows. They do comedy shows. What? Naked shows they do these naked comedy shows in New York sometimes. Yeah. The whole audience is naked. No, just the comics.

Speaker 5:          00:55:21       Uh, what the fuck I'm doing this. We're doing this thing, this weekend's Skank fest for two days for Legion of skanks and at the creek and the cave in Long Island city and we're having a, a naked roast battle. I see the novelty in it. I argued with a girl comic who's talking about like, this is about getting over things and you know, there's this artistic back to it. I go, whatever you say, I'm just telling you. Every guy goes there to see pussy. And she's at her argument was just like, no, like people want to see like, you know, the social experiment of it and see what I go. I'm going to look at Pussy and I'm telling you that I am Joe average in my thoughts. Like I am common guy, but she'll run into a guy who argue against that, but I don't go there for personalities.

Speaker 5:          00:56:07       I like to hear these people talk. So she came on our podcast with a dude who would. Yeah, just say the whole thing goes. No Man. It's about like, you know, getting over fears and Cochran like more just so excited to be with a girl like backstage with a girl and everyone's sitting there with your Dick and pussies out. Yup. We used, me and Kurt used to do a Gig in affiliate was where you could do comedy once in a while at a burlesque place called the five spot for less like a leg. They did dancing with their clothes on. They get down to the pastries and everything and the and the goofy outfits. But me and Kurt would do this once a month. We'd be like, do comedy on that show. In between. The first time we did it, we were bags and we were blown away because it's.

Speaker 5:          00:56:52       You never do it. Well, they go, don't be weird. Backstage dogs. He knows the theater technically. So the girls are running around naked know they're changing so they're just naked a lot and sometimes they would just sit around naked smoking cigarettes back there, butt naked, sitting down and chairs. Pussy all mashed up and me and me and I shouldn't even care throw curtains under the bus like this. I'll speak for myself only. I was just staring at tits and pussies nonstop. I just, I'll speak for Kurt when he was doing as well. I was staring at him and then the next week and the next time he came in, the next month it was a. There was like they put partitions up for the girls and I'm like, yeah, but I'm not gonna. Pretend that I wasn't back there to look above what you want me to force myself to look into your eyes if you're that comfortable being naked and be comfortable with me staring at you.

Speaker 5:          00:57:39       Buzzy. That's what I'm saying. Yeah. That's be a t shirt. It should. It should, because it's about to go to a nude beach and look at it as like for me and Jeff Ross were in Australia and we were just staring at the topless girls on the beach and they go, well, they go, that's, it's very common here to do that. So it's not a big deal. I'm like, well, it's not coming from me and we're going to stare at this girl's tits for awhile. Like I think it's fucking great. She has them out. Who gives a shit? But you would you stare at someone if they had clothes on? No, and I don't stare in a sense the same way. Yes. If a girl was wearing jeans that a great ass and I like moments to take, you know, to pick, to look at her ass shit.

Speaker 5:          00:58:19       If she knew that you were staring at, you know, where you avert your gaze. I never thought that. Uh, yeah, I would. I've never thought, uh, I was being like the girls who had their pussies that I think they think like thought that I was staring at them. I was trying to be as tactful as possible. You being slick, but I was constantly looking and enough so that like I couldn't be slick enough, I guess that they figured it out. Well, if you just have like a, a quick scan of the room, that's one thing. But if you keep looking in the general direction of naked people, even if you looking over their shoulder, they're going to know what you're doing. Oh yeah. But I've been that like I was that little fat John Candy Creep from splash. Remember when John Candy was a kid, like dropping the quarters to look up skirts and shit.

Speaker 5:          00:59:01       I don't remember that. That was his big thing to draw who dropped by quarters and then go down and look up scrutinized clash with Tom Hanks and what's her name? Daryl Hannah. Damn. I never, uh, I never did like a obnoxious, like look up a girl's skirt, like getting on the ground or pick something up. But like if I'd go to like a, like a rock concert when I was younger and there's, you know, on the lawn and there's a girl sitting like very purposefully, like, you know, she's naked or body painted. And her pussies out. Same thing, like a posture up at a place where I could check her pussy, eating her pussy out. Like someone opened the door, let a cat out out, close the gate, pushing a out. It sounds like it's a trap. Shit pussies out. It's wandered around the neighborhood. But you have a girl just comes to body painted naked.

Speaker 5:          00:59:48       Like yeah, I'll get in a position now where I can check it out. Of course you should. And so you should. And that's part of the game of being outside naked. They want you to see it just part of the way you are. But someones watching you watch that and go on like a piece of shit up objectifying. That's what I'm saying. I'll come to that and you're like, no man, I'm just being honest. Some girls but some men will do that. But those men are almost entirely week. All of them. Yeah. This wise, mind wise, there's just. Yeah, well they're the ones you find out there's like, you know, pedophile porn on their computers at one point when they die or they're just socially retarded and they just don't know how to communicate with girls and this is the, by being incredibly virtuous, they've picked up this extra personality trait that they think's gonna ask them over the top and whenever you're looking to find, I think the connection to fund with a woman when you do that, you're not going to find, you're not going to find it.

Speaker 5:          01:00:42       She did not gonna you're not gonna find that or you're like, you know, repressing something yourself because there really is like the, at the end of the day, like most women, I've never speak for all of them. Do one a man. Yeah. And most men want a woman. Yeah. But yeah, I mean, you know what I mean? A manly man in whatever way. I'm not like a handy guide necessarily, but like my girlfriend feels like secure with, you know what I mean? Like I'm a guy with a wild run away from her. If we get held up or something, you know, I don't try to fight for myself or like she feels like secure with me in several ways. My manhood is in whatever ways they are. Have there been like, I can't fix cars. I don't know how to do any of that shit. You know what I mean?

Speaker 5:          01:01:24       The problem isn't that there's men and then there's weak people and that there's inbetween. There's women and weak women and strong women. The problem is when people lash out against one group that has nothing to do with something that happened in the news, like if you talk about masculinity, toxic masculinity in this fucking assassination, that guy was mentally unbalanced, crazy, fuck, tormented. Evil, sociopath, psychopath would, whichever you want you want to call it, who did a heinous thing has nothing to do with masculine or feminine. It's just a stupid argument, and just to start that, to start that conversation conversation, you're like, you're separating the teams. You're making the left and the right. You're making the cowboys versus the raiders. You're doing something there. You're doing something there. You're, you're, you're establishing boundaries. It's just people that suck. That's the problem. This world has nothing to do with gender, nothing to do with sexual orientation, and as soon as you make it, those things,

Speaker 2:          01:02:20       you confuse the fuck out of the whole argument because if you can't make fun of any women or you can't talk shit about any women, well then you're admitting that women are weaker. Just like if I can make fun of men, but I can't make fun of women. If I make fun of women, I'm going to massage this. If I make fun of men too, I hate myself. Like how does that work? It doesn't work, but that's, you know, you gotta speak to her old friend Jamie Kilstein about those subjects. That's what he means. Well,

Speaker 5:          01:02:45       I do too, but I'm like, he seems like a different human being than the one that I knew. You know, over a decade ago,

Speaker 2:          01:02:53       people change big j. They sure do. They eat a lot of granola. Alfalfa. So bizarre. Yeah. Listen man, it's exactly what we're talking about. It's, you know, they just see people go too far, sometimes the ideas because there's nothing wrong with being gay. There's nothing wrong with being straight. There's nothing wrong with being a woman. There's nothing wrong with being a man. The problem is when people are shitty to each other, that's all it is. That's the only problem. It has nothing to do with anything else. So the. There is definitely a problem when it comes to mass shooters being all men. Yeah. That's probably looking at what the fuck's going on there, but don't just jump, don't just jump and assume and Delta put it out on the other $150 million men that live in the country. That is the dumbest fucking percentage point ever. Mass shooters and the rest of the men motherfucker come. Yeah, but. But they'll jump on this thing, man. People jump on this gender thing and they jump on you, which you got as a religious idea. Logically poison psychopath. That's what you got. That's interesting. Ted Talk Right now. I did not.

Speaker 5:          01:04:01       His Dad says some things where he was like, you know, was like, I'm, I'm appalled at what my son's done. Like God will work out the gaze himself. You see, he comes from like, you know, it doesn't always start, you know? Yeah. With the fucking story. I wonder when they a autopsy that guy will ever have. I'm still waiting to find that. I always heard Charles Whitman, right? He was the guy who climbed the tower and started shooting people in Austin. Yeah. Um, they said if he was a like all tops, if we have the same like science, like now that we had that back, if we had the same science then we have now they would have found out he had a, a temporal lobe tumor that was pushing on it. So he was, he woke up, he would have been found guilty of something, obviously murdered people.

Speaker 5:          01:04:51       But like I wonder how that would've gone legally because he woke up not his fault. Pure rage. Like he killed his dog. I think he killed his, his own girlfriend or something. He killed, I think, people on the way to the tower, just like everyone. He kind of came across, he just did something to him killed. So it's like, they're like, he might not be found guilty, sentenced to life in jail anymore, or something like that. I would've always wondered for something like that there because man, pulling a trigger on people's. I mean, you're, you're just at a totally different. I couldn't even wrap my brain around what that is that can make you do that, you know, the columbine kids and everything. You're like, it's not, I don't want to get in the same kind of Bill Maher trouble where he said, look, you know, that 9:11 suicide bombers are cowards. You know, you've got a lot of trouble for that. But I, I, I think I got what he was saying where I'm still kinda like, man, that's it. Fuck it. It's really, I think seeing somebody get shot with like affect me for a long, long couch. The wrong wing allowed to fucking coward is the wrong word. Being being, uh, having the ability to go and just like spray down a bunch of people, but it's fucking like, it's an intense thing to dive in.

Speaker 2:          01:05:59       Oh, it's a foolish thing to call them cowards because I think when you, whenever you call a murderer cowards, you, you like set your, your looked challenging. The manhood of other murderers. Yeah. Really. You know what I mean? Like you're calling me coward. Oh No, I take five. You want to the other one up. You after you insult them. Comic Little Dicks after they do something. Yeah. You feel better with your little Dick now tick thing. Oh my God. You know, it's just. This may be the shooter had a little Dick. Like, whoa. Really? I've read that on twitter. Men like a little Dick thing. Yeah. Coward. So psycho. Yeah. Coward is the wrong word. They're evil. That takes a lot of balls to fly a fucking plane right into a building. Like, you know, it's over. Oh my God. But you're definitely, you're going sideways to your banking hard into the building.

Speaker 5:          01:06:54       Oh, let's watch it. Let's watch a real quick video just to freak me out. I'm freaking out right now. I'm thinking it's going in the building. I'd say it's too tough. The beginning of, uh, most of most of that footage. The underneath one. Oh, you just see the building swallow it. Yeah. It's fucking bonkers. I remember watching it on tv that morning

Speaker 2:          01:07:17       just watching the plane hit the building over and over and over again. Just going, wow, how am I even seeing this? Is this even really? Am I seeing this?

Speaker 5:          01:07:24       The second one was one of the most like tense moments I've ever had in my life where I was just like, wait, because that's when you knew right away you're like, oh shit, this isn't an accident. Yeah. Because the first one they were still kinda like, there must be some kind of radar issues. There's still a hell of a radar issue. They flew to fucking planes filled with people in the buildings. That is one of the craziest moments in human history. And it happened during our lives and then after they did it, we imploded the building with our seven. Look at this. Boom.

Speaker 2:          01:07:59       That is so crazy.

Speaker 5:          01:08:03       Oh my goodness. Scale, scale. It's like so far away because it's so high up that you can't like how big that was. The people in that bill. You know what I'm saying? Like the actual, like six. You know what I mean? The situation that seems

Speaker 2:          01:08:16       like it's so, you know, just like finger lengths away from him. He said, but I mean like it how huge a fucking jet play on the floor, on the floor of a building. This. We're looking at the video of the tower. The second plane crashed the World Trade Center from the, uh, from the ground looking up. It's insane. It's still insane. It's still hard to believe, man. Still hard to believe. Yeah. This 15 years. It really, it still is that, that was in our lifetime in New York City. That the thing about those, that, that's, it's so. There's so much scary going on, right? Because there's the scary of someone that has the conviction of fly a plane right into a building that's fucking scary. There's the scary that they will take hundreds of innocent people with them. That's scary. There's a scared they're going to fly into a building they know is going to kill random people with kids, with moms, with Dads, with best friends with, you know.

Speaker 2:          01:09:08       Yeah. They don't give a fuck. They're going to fly right into that and kill all those people. And then the damage to the building of course was killed. Who knows how many people. But the whole thing is just bananas and will never have. I mean, you know, give them a turn to debone it. Well, but I don't know how much that, if it could ever happen at gathering, people will never. If you jumped up on a plane, I think now to say, hey everyone, I like to say I'm going to propose to my wife like, hey everyone out before someone's going to fucking mall like the temple you. I'm taking it out. Somebody told me to look up how many pictures there are people like hog tied on planes, a lot of pictures of that because like they just freaked out on a plate and get tied up because people get so nervous now.

Speaker 2:          01:09:52       Yeah. And rightly so. My I am, I am surprised at the amount of people I will say who got hurt and killed in Orlando because I'm surprised there wasn't like this. A lot of people in tight quarters may think he just got swarmed at some point. Yeah. I don't know what happened. I don't know where he was. He might've had a vantage point where he could shoot. Nobody could get behind them. Might, you know, he might have scattered some people really quick and they might have done a lot of the damage themselves. I've fallen on top of each other. You got to realize that a gun like that you could squeeze off 50 rounds in seconds. So he killed 50 people and wounded 50 more or something along those lines. I mean like that. Just go like that with your finger. Go. Don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't.

Speaker 2:          01:10:33       That's what that gun can do. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10, 11, 12. You've already shot 12 people. Thirty, 40, 50, 60. You know, you keep going. Twenty one, 22 through to divert. Some of them are the ones where it's. So it's got, it's got to be a trigger pull for every bullet, most likely, unless he made it a automatic. I think there's some guns you can alter that. You can turn them into a automatics most likely. And Ar is one of those. I don't know, I'm not, I would be speaking out of school, but I know for sure it has a semiautomatic function and when you pull it, it's just every time you pull your finger treats a bullet. Single Doo Doo Doo Doo Doo Doo Doo Doo Doo Doo Doo Doo Doo Doo Doo Doo Doo Doo Doo. I mean you can literally shoot faster than you can say the numbers.

Speaker 2:          01:11:10       One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10. You shooting way more than that. You just fire them off man. And you would hear people that cell phone, you could hear it in the background and it's quick. It's terrific. Terrific that someone would have that in them. And so it's like there's no like, uh, like Orlando, Florida. Yeah. Well you hear about the alligator that had a baby yesterday or no in Orlando at Disneyland. No Shit. Yeah, alligator ate a fucking baby. One year old baby snatched them, drug them into the water and they, they, they won't say killed the baby. This is how weird the news is. They want to say it took the baby underwater. Yeah, no immediate ate the baby today. They feel too. That's so rough, dude. You can't go near water and Florida, man. You can't go near water. They are infested.

Speaker 2:          01:12:04       I used to live there when I was a kid and we used to feed them. I used to live in Gainesville, Florida, and we used to go to Lake Alice. There's this little pond and we'd throw marshmallows in the water and the alligators would come up and it was like they were harmless. They were always laying around like you would walk around near alligators. Really fucking so strange. Now that I think about it like I had, I had a crazy dude on many occasions. I was within 20, 30 yards of an alligator. They'd never fucked with people. They never did anything, but it was because they were endangered. They killed a fuck load of them. So when people first got to Florida, I guess they just started slaughter and alligators and they slaughtered them so much that they became protected. So when I lived there, I guess it was the seventies, it was protected.

Speaker 2:          01:12:49       He couldn't kill alligators, but now there's guys who have like tags, like professional alligator hunters. They have 500 tags so they can go out and shoot 500 alligators and really they can't put a dent in the population. They let these mother fuckers take root and they're everywhere. Do you see that 15 foot one that was walking across the golf course the other day because they figured out that was real. Yeah, it's real. There's two different angles. Do you see the new angle into. I go, dude. I mean it's a dinosaur. It's a dinosaur to new angle to really close to it. They're like, you know, like less than 30, 40 yards away from it looks depending on how strong their zoom is on the like crazy tall two huge. It's enormous. It's walking. It's like it's not. I thought that would kind of dragged on the ground, this things walking because you're almost like, what do you do it?

Speaker 2:          01:13:36       You just kill that. So that piece is off the earth. Well, it's going to kill things. Whatever. Whatever it gets a chance to kill. It's going to kill. I mean that. There's not a whole lot that's going to get away from that thing. It's not that fast. They run like about as fast as a person, maybe a little faster than the average person. Have they tracked it or was it bar? It's a good question. I don't know what if they stayed up with it at all? Those things scare the fuck out of me. Those are heartless lizards and they let these goddamn things get to a really high level of population. I'm not saying we should make them extinct, but they definitely need to chop them down. There's way too many of them and there's not a lot of people that are interested in chopping them down like they used to be like you'd have to send a lot of people out into the.

Speaker 2:          01:14:20       In the everglades they found Nile crocodiles. Really? Yeah, they have a kill on site order for Nile crocodiles. They found them all because they're super aggressive and they found a bunch of them so far. They're huge. Those things get to be more than 20 feet long. Just the ones that need water buffaloes and shit. Is there a video, a video of a world obese get me by. Oh Dude. You never seen. No. Huge abandoned initial attempt go to Nile crocodile eats willdabeast. There's like thousands of videos because these things can go under water for hours at a time, so what they do is they slide into a pond and they move closer to where the hubs are. They, they hear the sound of the hoods and they get in the water and then they're underwater lying in the mud for fucking hours, just waiting for something to come up and take a drink and when these things come up and take a drink, they just get snatched. No, five. There's some close ups, man. There's some really good close ups. I don't know if this is a good one. I haven't seen it before. So the crocodiles, we'll wait for these things and just decide all right, time to eat

Speaker 2:          01:15:30       and they're all in the water. They have to make these treks across the rivers. I don't see any crocodiles. Jeremy [inaudible] just mother fuckers. It was just a racist way. Better videos is way better videos where it's like really close up.

Speaker 6:          01:15:49       Left there

Speaker 2:          01:15:53       either watch other side. Jesus.

Speaker 5:          01:15:57       Yeah, just drags it. Sorry. They're sad.

Speaker 6:          01:16:02       Yeah.

Speaker 5:          01:16:03       That's why I go see Jesus. Nature stuff never makes me sad, but I'm always taken back by how

Speaker 5:          01:16:11       even when I watched one the other day, it was just, I don't watch a lot of those shows. The nature shows when you see when it was like a or. No, it was on world star hip hop. Actually. It's why I watched it. It was like a, the Emerald Wasp zone Africa, uh, how it kills cockroaches. It's like hit me like a zombifies them, like grabs him. It does a whole process that rips off the antenna and then sticks it to kind of paralyze it and it doesn't paralyze it. It just makes it woozy. And then, and then genesis, second thing into the brain and just like liquefies the brain than just like, it's much smaller than the cockroach. And then just lowers the cockroach back.

Speaker 2:          01:16:49       Wow. Just take some back. And this thing, it's this big. It just sucks. It's brain out. Yeah. And then it just brings it back and just throws it on the ground for the kids. Holy Fuck.

Speaker 2:          01:17:03       There's so many weird bugs, man. When you really pay attention to all the different kinds of species of bugs, it's very scary because we're just so lucky. They're little. They give bugs. Were like a cow sized. We'd be fucked. We would be fucked. Oh yeah. If we ever fucking VF ESX server, we're lucky. We're so lucky. Their little man, you know we are, but we are no match for so much shit in nature. Like animals and stuff. Like we couldn't. You couldn't fight that and crocodile for sure. No, there's so many weird bugs to where they have like weird things that they somehow or another figure out how to do. I'd say there's some parasite that takes over a grasshopper's body. It burrows into its body, takes over its brain and hijack set and talks this grasshopper into committing suicide by jumping into a lake so that he can spawn out of its body and it bursts out of his body like an alien.

Speaker 2:          01:18:02       What is this one, Jamie? Oh, sorry. It's going to kill itself. Okay. Well these grasshoppers, they killed themselves and then this aquatic worm comes out of their body. There it is. It talks the grasshopper and the killing itself so they can give birth to this warm. I mean, look at this. It grew in this thing's fucking body and it's long, like many, many, many times longer than the than the grasshopper itself. How fucking strangers that just. It's like it is pure evil. So there's so many creatures that are just like, it's. But it works somehow or another. There's probably too many grasshoppers and nature figured out some sort of a way to weed it out, thin out the herd. I mean, think about all those asshole willdabeast crossing that stupid river. Of course we need crocodiles. What do you want? Like an unlimited number of willdabeast.

Speaker 2:          01:18:56       You can't go anywhere. You're trying to get on a highway, there's willdabeast everywhere, but is that interestingly sort of like a parallel between like a bit of a stretch I guess, but like the order of the nightclub shooting thing, it really is an emotional creatures like pack, herd creatures like that. Uh, just like one of them is just getting killed by a stone cold killer like that, that crocodile. You said they're, they're not emotional boy. You couldn't teach a crocodile to love somebody. Yeah, but that's not an aberration. That's like standard crocodile behavior. When a person is doing it, it's like this crazy aberration. Is He, at least today, it's a deviation for sure, but I'm just saying there is. He's coming out of a praying mantis now and going right into the water so this aquatic worm can fuck with everything. Look at this.

Speaker 2:          01:19:41       He killed the praying mantis and he's escaping through its body into water. This is fucking nuts, man. What a strange animal. Look out. Big Pine comes near them and uh, he yells, the mountain lion goes away. And then the mountain lion was like, fuck this bitch. And He makes them mad. Run out of them and the guy sprays it right in the face with bear spray and scares it off, but it's fucking terrifying. It's a terrifying video because you realized that a hundred and 50 monster was trying to eat this dude and if you didn't spray it in his face with some chemicals, he would've been donesville this guy. We watched a murder. We watched like a cat murder a guy. I mean this is, this is what happened. Like Gimme Gimme some volume on this. Jamie.

Speaker 7:          01:20:22       I was expecting quite honestly for them to just stay in the bush and watch me go by.

Speaker 2:          01:20:27       There's a quote here that's okay. We don't have to watch the news version of it, but that capital right out.

Speaker 7:          01:20:38       I like being an ecstatic to seeing them too, being like really scared

Speaker 2:          01:20:43       and those things will fuck you. Fuck you up. No danger of like when they all go out to a bunch of the comments [inaudible] of Joshua tree and shoot a lot of them, a lot of them. They're making a lot of noise. They'll stay away. Yeah, because cat doesn't know if you have guns or something like that and they're naturally wary about people. They know that people occasionally have guns, so they sort of program to be scared of people. Stay away. Yeah, but if you're running that's a problem because running seems like you're trying to get away, so it excites them. Just like rolling a ball of yarn front of a cat and excites them. Like if you were hiking and that same person hiking probably wouldn't have as much of a an attractant to that. Cat Bikes are bad too. They see try and take off on a bike and they realize that's pretty fast. Motherfuckers going to get away if I don't have to just start sprinting towards. You see the video of the guy on the bike, he gets to get kicked by, its gets kicked. What's the animal? He gets knocked off a bikeway gazelle maybe. Oh, I have seen that as jumping on me. It just wasn't. That guy goes flying so far off the bike. The thing just like hit him going 50 miles an hour sideways, right? Yeah. Even the guy, it's like a buck or something. Right? What kind of animal is it, Jimmy?

Speaker 2:          01:21:55       Oh, Jesus. He got fucked up. It was like you should have went high fived and other, uh, of what is it a gazelle, right? Yeah, yeah. It goes. He goes now, like I told you, motherfucker, that was their jackass. Three video. The Gazelle community. That's their jackets. Three. Oh, nailed them. Oh my God. Look out and look at the gazelle. Just sort of bounces off of them and runs away. Easy campaign. How, how powerful animals are over us. We'll look at that through the air. Look, I mean it's probably 250 300 pounds and it's throwing itself into the air. You know, that's a big ass animal. It's pretty impressive that we dominate the earth to considering that like we are not even anywhere near the most powerful. Just the smartest technical are so much smarter than those dummies sit. We can shoot them from a distance that you could make a, an antelope.

Speaker 2:          01:22:50       You could turn into a steak, eat it. Exactly. All you have to do is set up a bi-pod. Get a nice clean rest, relax you breathing, squeeze your fingers and boom, a bullet goes through its body. You go pick it up, you it, you open it up. Take the organs that are edible, chop it down, throw it on the grill and you're eating it in like less than an hour. But if you're in like backed in a corner against the wall, you're fucked with any dude in the world. You have a, you have a puncher's chance of getting out of that thing. Okay? But as a gazelle is just going to murder you quickly, you're fucked. A fucking ran that aren't even that big. They'll just fucking pulverize you. I liked my chances with Ram, it's take chess. If I got a knife and a Iran wants to get crazy. I know if I'm talking about straight, oh, straight, like just choke him. I think I could joke around.

Speaker 2:          01:23:43       I didn't take his back. First of all, I feel like if I break one of his front legs, he's not going anywhere. Right. So I'll. I'll just dive on a Kamora. Are you using using Dalton's theory from roadhouse man's leg? I'm going to slide under him, so when he raises up, when he raises up, I'm going to get that part. I'm going to push it forward and then I'm going to get that double wrist lock position. I'm going to crack that fucking leg. Then I'm going to roll into mountain and once I get into mount, I get ahold of his handlebars, Bro.

Speaker 2:          01:24:12       Probably hit me and knocked me 30 feet into the air. Have you ever seen the video of ghost write a book for you? Joe Rogan shows you how to defeat animals, feeding wildlife with, uh, just go through each animal. Obviously. Don't try to fight a buffalo, but um, there's a video of a ram and a cow headbutting. It's fucking crazy because it's ram as only like, I mean, I don't know, it can't be more than like 150 pounds. So it's not that big an animal. And the cows a fucking huge cow and they collide heads. The cow was trying to get the, to stay the fuck away from it. So it charged it and headbutted this ram and the ram and knocked him the fuck out. Knocked the cow out. Yeah, just on the couch. His legs up. Watch this. Watch this. Watch it right here.

Speaker 2:          01:24:59       Right here. Right here. The ribs coming up. The cows like, oh, I fucked up the rams woozy. But it gets right back up. Like what I liked. I liked that a cow just because of their build has naturally has a knockout arms. Where were. They're still snoring. What was that video? They're going to show a ram running over a biker. There was. It was up next. It was playing up next. That's my thought was so crazy was jackass guys like when it got into the thing with a ram and just let her rams nails a bunch of crazy. Those guys. Well, how about when he, you johnny? Knoxville stood blindfolded in front of a bull for. Oh Shit. It just ran right into his bike. On the back of the ram. Yeah. What is that about? Why is there a Gopro on the ram? This is stupid. Don't give these people any. How dare you put a go pro. People were abusing wildlife, but in Gopros on Ram. That's ridiculous. Extreme though. It is an extreme ram because that's what I needed to go pro. And you become extreme. Yeah, no shit. You put one on your head. It's extreme. Did you, are that mcconkie documentary on? No, what is

Speaker 5:          01:26:04       it about the guy who was like, he was an extreme skier and that he's got wait until the wing suits and base jumping and shit. And uh, they got a guy, I don't know if it was him that passed away like this, but I remember in the documentary, yeah, there's a base jump, uh, somebody does illegally, you know that you can't, they're not like, okay to do anywhere really I guess. And he does a base jumping like a state park when he lands the park, police were ever start chasing him and while he's running from them trying to get away, he dies like in the jumps in the creek and the water takes some or something and he ends up drowning or something like that. Oh. So then they stage is why I stay away from all this shit. Then they stage a, uh, like a jumping, a protest jump because the police should take some but their fault somehow they chased the guy, he jumped into the creek and uh, so they staged this jump where everyone's going to base, jump off this mountain and then when they land there, know, willingly getting arrested and by the third person who did it, you just see the bike just go.

Speaker 5:          01:27:10       Pumps, smacks the ground. Like shoe doesn't open because someone dies again doing it. It's like idiots. This is dumb. The dumb thing to do, she's as Christ. We all, my radio show we were talking about, uh, like run. I'm all for amusement park rides, roller coasters and everything. But you do hear the numbers of people who have died on ones you've road is pretty crazy, like pretty, pretty fucking great. But we still keep getting on it. But maybe people die every year. Have you had to guess? We're going to google it. I'm going to die every year. And rollercoasters around the country. One hundred hundred. Yeah, I say less first day that the first day of one of them because they didn't realize there had to be a height regulation for two tall seven people in the car or something like that. I'm totally like seven people the first day.

Speaker 5:          01:27:57       Oh my God. That must've been on one run. You know what I mean? Like s seven tall people just got the cast, so seven people. Then they kept the ride. I haven't been to an amusement park in a while, but yeah, I haven't. I haven't been to an amusement park in awhile, but they now have height limits. Like you can't be too tall either. What's up Jim? There's not that many. Actually. I said 13. You said 100. What is the actual number point two? Seven deaths per year. Oh, that's it. There's only been 52 since 19. Between 1990 and carnivals and everything. Rollercoaster rollercoaster carnivals and the amusement park desk. Because some of them things aren't really. Rollercoasters has all sorts of different shit. Like those like drops. Let's create. People have died in those things. Oh Man. We watched her legs and some of those fucking disasters, but the willing to go into it, but I don't know for some reason I think there's a much lower risk of amusement park rides than like Scott. A guy called us in and went skydiving. He said they, they even let him cut corner. He was like a bigger guy so they didn't make him wear a certain kind of harness and he went into

Speaker 2:          01:29:02       street clothes, you're not really supposed to do that. And he said he went out. He says fucking shoot, like got wound up. Like it got like he literally, he hit the ground and they got fucked up. But like, uh, but it kind of opened like really late and so he still hit the ground like hard, but like, you know, not hard enough to like kill them. You know? What's crazy is that Disney has probably the safest rides and the safest ride record. They have huge amusement parks with amazing rides, wild, crazy shit, space mountain tower of terror, all that stuff. Yet they let a fucking dinosaur live in their resort. This allegation, this kid did, they had a dinosaur living there like they didn't check the lake for dinosaurs. You know how fucking crazy that is? I mean, imagine if you had a lake behind your house and you were pretty sure dinosaurs lived in that lake and you had a kid, but he kinda came out of a lake so that it wasn't little upon there.

Speaker 2:          01:29:55       Like any body of water, man, they'll crawl across the highway and jump into a swimming pool. They don't give a fuck. They find them and people's pools. Really? Dude, there's so many of them. There's so many of them. Then there's the everglades. The everglades are infested, infested with alligators. There's so many of them. People would go fan boat and they have all kinds of crazy shit in there now though, they have pythons and alligators and like you said, Nile crocodiles, there's all sorts of ways to place dump a body. Oh, it's my last con. El gives you get it like that. There was a lot of fucking. And then they have wild pigs. There's a lot of shit going on in Florida. It's a terrible place. Florida, I was just there last weekend in Miami. It's like, and by the way, I had a great time and fun people place.

Speaker 2:          01:30:40       The actual place itself is just like that. Humidity is the grossest thing I've ever dealt with. Well, it's also, there's an echo of the past in that state and the entire city of Miami's like almost entirely funded by cocaine. That's how that city became Miami. That's why it has more banks per capita, allegedly probably Google this because I've said it too many times more banks per capita. I think I found it on. Um, Billy Corbin's movie cocaine cowboys I think was talking about that. Maybe not, but it was all coke saw people running coke and that fucking per se, just like a bunch of clubs and restaurants and doing blow shooting people and all the crime that was wrapped around coke and all the murders and the violence and all the police corruption. Dude. Did you ever see cocaine cowboys? Yeah, that was good. Did you ever see corruption?

Speaker 2:          01:31:32       Do you ever see the 75? I had Michael Dowd in. Oh really? Yeah, he's great. He's hilarious. Yeah. You should get them on legion of skanks for sure. He'll do it. So you're not a terrible guy. No. Really? I mean saint. Yes. I enjoy his company. He did some crazy shit for sure. Everybody was doing blow and he was out of his fucking mind and went to jail. He did his time and now he's just trying to figure out what he's doing. He's selling cigars and doing a bunch of different. I've always loved the wives when they're just kinda like. I thought it was weird when we were going to Fiji on a beat cops salary. They're just like, they don't know. They just want to believe so bad. Yeah. He's driving around a red corvette. He's like, everyone's like, what the fuck is. They were maniacs.

Speaker 2:          01:32:15       They're maniacs, but it's a great movie. It's a real a testament though to like the same personality is extreme personalities that want to become like, you know, just go fucking full blown. Outlaw is the same. God said, I'm going to protect everyone. Yes. Yeah. It's a really isn't. And one companies be Lord to the other side in a heartbeat. Well, he slowly but surely got chipped away at and I think also like he was talking about how his very first days on the job he experienced like intense corruption where guys were talking about killing people that snitched on cops and they were like kind of openly admitted that a guy fell off of a roof that snitched on cops. And he's like, uh, you know, that's what happens. And he was like, okay, got it. We're good, you know, and became over time corrupt. And he's pretty honest about it, man.

Speaker 2:          01:33:04       I mean, he doesn't hold anything back. So it's pretty. I mean, it wasn't good times. He wasn't a good guy. No, no question about it. But it's a question of, well, yeah, they were like looking the other way. What people did get killed. I want to hear a story, you know, I mean, I think it's an important story. There's not a lot of cops that have gone bad that are approachable. Like Michael Dowd, he's the most approachable and interesting and you know, and he doesn't get along with the other guys that he was uh, involved with the time because I guess they at each other out or one guy ratted him out. Kenny, one of the guys on the show apparently, or in the movie, but it's a great fucking movie that, that guy that he's a talking to in the movie from where's he from?

Speaker 2:          01:33:45       Nicaragua or something like that. South America, the Dominican Republic. Maybe that guy in him or making cigars now. Oh really? Yeah. The Guy who was in the movie talking about killing people disappeared. Yeah. It was like the main drug dealer guy. Yeah. That was basically his partner. It was his name again. Okay. But it's kind of funny. They get, they get in with them with all those corruptions stories where they get in, like with the drug deal, but there's, they're almost like Newbie guys like this is all kind of scary for us to. So what are we know? But we went in, we'd love to get a part of this money and then they start getting the money and then it says they start coming like whacking people around and stuff. Hey Pablo, is this your new guy? Just like drag him across the face. She'll make me a big.

Speaker 2:          01:34:27       Well you jerk off will in this case it's actually kind of like a, a, a happy ending drug dealer story because the two guys are still friends. Like they're older now and the two cops are still friends. No, the car and the truck dealer. They're buddies. Like Michael Dow visited the dude to go save and put pictures of the two of them hanging out at his instagram page. So in that sense they kind of. What was the other car? Him and his partner, but the partner and him don't get along. The partner. The testified against him.

Speaker 5:          01:34:58       Yeah. The partner wore a wire for him. Right. So yeah, the parties, we set them up to be like, hey, we're going to let this lady get killed. Yes. Yeah. And then it all fell apart. It's crazy. It's imagine being those guys in that time. It's crazy. I wonder with this length of time to get, because you're going to be on edge no matter what. Whenever you're starting something that, you know, it was like bad, like you know, it's like uh, how, how long from starting it, like, where you're nervous. Do you just be like, this is just life and then one day it just all fucking gone. But you do eventually forget that day is coming. I don't think he ever thought it was coming. I think he was just a cooked up maniac. I think when you do a lot of coke you're just always. And then you try and get some sleep and then you wake up in the morning.

Speaker 5:          01:35:43       He not planning your future, you just, just red lining every day. I've never been to coachella ever. I don't even know. He never done it. I did two lines ever. Your two lines ahead of me. I did both of them. I was just like, I stopped. It was like immediate guilt of both. Just being like, I don't want it. Like, this is like so out of my range of like wanting to get involved in like, what if it's great. Now I've got a whole fucking thing with this now. If it's great, like I don't want to get into that shit. Dude. You're exactly like me in that regard. I took us, I drank some tea once that was made out of coca leaves and uh, it's a real pick me up. But the problem is for some. I mean I was on mushrooms at the time as well, but I couldn't shut the fuck up.

Speaker 5:          01:36:25       I like couldn't shut the. I was with Stan hope and I was talking to him. I was like, dude, I'm really sorry but I can't shut the fuck up. I don't know what's going on. I want to be annoying. I don't know what it's going out with my mouth, my mouth. I was just diarrhea. Just wouldn't stop. I haven't, I haven't taken a whole lot of shit. That some weird stuff. I've tried. I tried adderall. How is that? Um, I was just awake for like, that's how it affected me. A girl out here, actually, when I came to visit one time a friend. This girl kept me awake for three days. Tell me what you know Rick Shapiro? Yes, it was Rick Shapiro's ex-girlfriend. Oh, good Lord. Who is a comic also. It was a friend of mine. She just let me crash at her apartment. It was just doing that are all together. She was just like, you want to try to add A. I'm like, I never have. I'm sure I'll give it a whirl and three days she kept me awake and talking to me about the genius of Rick Shapiro and making me watch video clips of him and everything.

Speaker 5:          01:37:17       Like clockwork orange eyes up my eyes and she was like, just adderall be with that and maybe watch Rick Shapiro, which is not what other. I mean I love Rick, but that's not what another comic wants to do is sit there and watch Rick Shapiro mapped doubt check. She is also an adderall math adderalls meth visit. Really? Oh yeah, it's math. Oh Wow. Yeah. I mean I don't know how much she was really gone by the time I saw her. She was a, well that's one of the reasons my gals like it. Yeah. It keeps showing skinny, but uh, yeah, I did adderall. I've done, uh, I did ecstasy once. I did it once to Jamie. Pull that up.

Speaker 2:          01:37:56       Whether or not adderall, like what's the division? Adderall in math, it's like a very minor difference means. And it depends which one you take. I'm pretty sure. But look it up at there's more than one kind of adderall, different kinds of outer or adderall. Like things. Yeah, because generic form is and it's very similar things. It's fucking pill pill head kick in at once or twice and I got a different one each time I took it, so that's good. I'd hate to say that I enjoy from time to time a, a like a Vicodin or percocet? Yeah, like vary from time to time. I tried one or the other. I don't remember which one it was. I think it was Vicodin, but didn't agree with me. Yeah. Yeah, just like just, I just was really out of it. Okay. Chemically adderalls and mixture of several amphetamine salts specifically.

Speaker 2:          01:38:38       It's a con. It's composed of equal parts of amphetamine, aspartate monohydrate, amphetamine sulfate, Dextro, amphetamine sulfate, and Dextro Amphetamine, Saturate. I'm don't know what that means. Sounds like, what's the difference between adderall and Meth? Because, uh, just what's the difference? What's the difference between were so folks shouldn't be. You guys want to take adderall? I guess we're getting is metro. Let's organize. Let's, uh, let's build a fort the. I have a 13 year old daughter now too, so that's always the thing, you know, got a buy to go try out a bunch of new drugs now. Seems like a bad idea. Okay. Chemically the are very closely related. Adderall contains dextroamphetamine salts that psychoactive chemical is amphetamines, meth is methamphetamine. The difference between the two is the molecules is one methyl group. So they're both amphetamines, but one is a different kind of amphetamine, but they're very close.

Speaker 2:          01:39:47       Hmm. Interesting. Okay. For taking it for those three days, I'd never felt like a itch to go back ever. Some people love it, man. No, some people fucking love it. I absolutely think you got a lot of energy. You're, you're uh, you're always like a, like a fucking upbeat sort of a dude. Some people I don't think have that kind of energy and maybe whether it's health related or not a little pick me up like an adderall gives you a little feeling of getting shit done and apparently it's great for school. Kids that are in school are cramming, you know, keep you up and stuff like that. Those things that like, you know, any of the. But I know it's the like it calms you down or ramps you up. Freaks you out. Yeah. It doesn't make sense to me. I don't get how that it is like how different could it with chemical B and people. Obviously you have queer retarded. Clearly not scientists. I wasted one of these lab coats. I'm not convinced it's even, I mean I know it has some sort of an effect on people, but the way it's been distributed

Speaker 5:          01:40:53       like that, when they're giving it to kids, like it's one of the most controversial things of giving these psychoactive compounds to kids. Not Knowing the longterm effects of it. And so many doctors are just so willing to jump into it and give them, give these kids pills the as long as their parents are into it, they'll just fucking order it away to keep asking about documentaries. Did you watch the thalidomide one yet? No, that's gotta be terrible. They gave it to the moms. Right. And then they say, I'll see I see it on Netflix but I keep getting nervous to watch it because I'm like it's gonna that's gonna be a bum out. There's some crazy drugs that they gave people that they had an idea of some risks but they didn't know either. I don't think they really know until you give it to like a million people and then you find out like oh this can happen too and this can happen too.

Speaker 5:          01:41:39       And then by the time it's too late you're dealing with these horrible birth defects with thalidomide. It's also funny how much like the stuff like, you know, they just keep adding for legal reasons, stuff to those warnings on ship. But they don't really like that. If you ask like specific things to the pharmacist, because I remember like Lexapro the first time I went on tour with like corn and Rob Zombie so and like a bunch of bands, so I was like, I wanted to smoke weed, maybe drink a little bit. I'm not a big huge drinker but I'll drink on this a little bit and smoke weed. And I'd asked the pharmacist and I was like, it says here do not drink with us at all. And they were like, no, it's just because like that's just part of the thing is like, you know, so you don't. If you're taking some of the antidepressant of sorts, like why would you take a depressant to bring it back down? And I was like, but I was like, but it's not for like in my mind I was going to be like take a pill, drink a beer, like explode like a seagull with an episode. But my fear was is that work a seagull with Alka Seltzer. I video ever video of that, but that was the thing when I was younger. If you give Alka Seltzer with seagull, they'll explode.

Speaker 5:          01:42:49       I remember vaguely hearing that. I don't know if it's an actual thing. Yeah. I don't know either. Exploding seagulls. So what we want to know the Lexapro. Did we talk about this before? I'm not sure I got super like a physical reaction to anxiety that I've never had before in my life. I never, I never really thought I had anxiety. Um, and then right before I was going on tour with those bands, I got very nervous on top of like having a crazy, a landlord dispute out of nowhere. I think they just read, they get charged more for our place and so they were like, Hey, you've been great tenants for a year, but, you know, get out. And um, my daughter was in school still and we just kinda like. So we sent a letter just sort of asking like, Hey, can we hang in there for, you know, gives like three more months.

Speaker 5:          01:43:36       Just like she finished the school year and they just served us with court papers. Whoa. So we ended up winning that, which was fine, but it was very tense. I mean, like they called the cops on us a bunch just making shit up. Oh God. This old Asian lady bit. My ex wife's. This was one of the landlords. Yeah. Oh Jesus. Shake bitter. It was because she was just like trying to film us, like going into the house or something. So my ex wife to women's getting shitty with each other and one doesn't speak English. She's filled, they're filming each other. And then the lady I bit her hand while she was telling it got like that volatile in one day. Uh, I was on the computer watching something and I'm just like, it popped back on whatever it was, like my hands went numb and I've never had it in my life.

Speaker 5:          01:44:21       And I just, uh, wigged out and like try to go to bed. I'm like, I'll sleep it off or whatever it is is, you know, I'm sure I'm okay. Woke up in the morning, didn't feel better. And then after like a month or two I ended up doing on what's going on Lexapro. Wow. So it was just a combined anxiety thing. All tests. Yeah. Apart in that. But I've never been right since that day. Oh no shit. Yeah, like anxiety is like a major issue in my life. It wasn't before then now. And it always manifests into my new one now is that I smoke. So I know it doesn't help at all, like cigarettes. I mean it doesn't help it at all, but I feel like, uh, if I pay attention to my breathing, I have to like extra fill my lungs. Were they, it's all just like, it's involuntary, like mental shit.

Speaker 5:          01:45:02       Wow. Yeah, it sucks. But uh, what have you tried to do to get, get over it? And exercise helps always. Um, and just trying to like distract, you know, it is like, it kind of all the symptoms that I feel the fake whatever they are [inaudible] the little pings and pangs it. It's a, if they happened long enough and I don't die from whatever it is I think I have or whatever thing, I'm like convincing my body that I have, it just goes away because I'm like, well, it's not a real thing. Right? Like I used to get like at its worst when I got it really bad then and I was going to the hospital a bunch. Like it was like all limbs going, like tingly, numb. It was just scary, you know what I mean? And your heart starts beating fast. Just panic attacks.

Speaker 5:          01:45:46       Really? Wow. But I've never, I've always been someone who would laugh at somebody would have panic attacks, I guess. Not a real thing like get your shit together. And uh, and then I had it. I was asked to make some apologies. I was like, man, this sucks because, you know, you walk into a hospital knowing you're like, just tell me, you know, we have to the machine and tell me that I haven't had a heart attack and everything again. I know I haven't, but like I have to come here like compulsively I have to come here to make sure. Wow. It's crazy that those things like blew a fuse almost in your head. Yeah. I asked a, a psychologist, that is why I said I go is can someone just pop one day, like, just hit a level and pop. And he was like, absolutely.

Speaker 5:          01:46:26       Yeah. Wow. Nobody thinks that. Yeah, I don't usually think that they think that you can just bring it back down. You'll be fine. Get it back. You'll be fine. Yeah. But it's a, it's a constant thing. Sure. What kind of exercise you're doing at the DDP Yoga? I've been doing a lot. A fucking great. Yeah. A diamond page for like if you don't like what's DDP? The double penetration would have fucking these guys doing. DDP Yoga is a former pro wrestler. Dallas diamond page is put together a yoga program. Yep. Fucking really difficult program. Gets a lot of people in shape, man. Easy. It's nice. Long sessions. He does and he has a couple of short ones you can combine, but it's doable. It's a good sweat for sure. I want to start like now it's like warm again and hopefully I have a few weeks at home now. Like I want to like I miss like lifting any weights of any kind.

Speaker 5:          01:47:16       It's good for the body. It's really good for you. And as an yeah. As a man. Especially as you get older, you're going to lose muscle tissue, your bones going to get weaker. That's the best way to keep that. One of the only ways. I mean your body's supposed to be doing stuff, you know, we have these weird lives we live where you can just all day long have very minimal movement. It's not natural for a person. I think we did talk this before by the crossfit for a little while and that's just like a lot of injuries, not an advocate. Well, some people love it. It's good for them. Some people push each other and they love it. I get it. Yeah. Well I'm going to you. You kind of already have to have A. I don't think it's. I don't think it's a good idea to jump into like fat person who has not worked out at all, but I'll go try crossfit.

Speaker 5:          01:48:00       It's Sorta what I did. It worked in every sense of like I lost weight. I lost a bunch of weight and so that was my major weight loss was like 70 pounds and I've kind of like always plateaued around there since then. But it was like a definitely like dense muscle growth, you know what I mean? Like I felt better. I looked good, I felt better about myself, looks wise when I did that over the yoga or anything like that that I do. So what's the problem? Speed. Weightlifting. Men destroyed. Like I am just starting to get to a point now where I don't wake up and still if it's cold out or if I sleep with air conditioning, like in the morning, like my back and just be shut off for like 15 minutes. I have to really work on it to like. So you hurt your back.

Speaker 5:          01:48:43       Wipe my ass. Yeah. I'm just, you know, they go, hey, for 15 minutes, let's go over with a pvc pipe. Had a do proper snatched lifts and then they go, all right, now do it as fast as many as you can in eight minutes, you know. And uh, and this is the guy who was the fastest and don't be the slowest, and then it's like, you know, you're rushing through it. You're going to lose form every time. Yeah. This has been some pretty unfortunate accidents because of the. Oh hell yeah. I mean, but it is. If you are in great shape and you stick the form and do it, it's one of the most amazing workouts of all time either. Well, you could definitely get a good workout in. You're definitely gonna burn off a lot of energy and things along those lines. And some people love it. I don't do it, but I do similar exercises. I understand what they're doing. Kettlebell stuff. I love Kettlebells, but I'm more of the proponent of um, especially now I've been listening to this guy, pavel tattooing, you know, he is, he's the guy that brought kettle bells to America and uh, between him and I learned a lot from this guy, Steve Maxwell's on my podcast

Speaker 2:          01:49:48       a bunch of times and they are more proponents of lifting heavy weights for lower repetitions. And then there's this other guy named Keith Weber who's got a totally different approach, but it's just an endurance workout. He's got this thing called extreme kettlebell cardio workout. You could do that with a 35 pound kettlebell man. A little light kettlebell. Yeah. But it's so much work and there's so much body weight involved. You just fall and he does it with you. And he's a stud. He's in incredible shape and handling other workouts. There's a bunch of different ones. Um, he's got a bunch of different ones that work your upper body lower body, if I remember correctly, the ones I usually do is off the first video. He's got three videos now. The ones I usually do off the first video I think are about 40 minutes. Someone like your dad by the time that was 40 minutes is up 42 minutes maybe.

Speaker 2:          01:50:36       Or they can do those in the house. Yeah. Yeah. I just need one kettlebell you need. That's a big thing. So I was like hot potatoes, being standing rose, switch the hands and you just keep going and going. It gives you like little breaks. But then you just keep going and so that, wait, that 35 pound weight just feels like an eternity. It feels like. I just fuck it. It feels like you lifted 75 pounds by the end. Yeah, I got into doing like as much. So you'll go on the road a lot too. It's like trying to find out like hotel room. I don't like going to the hotel gyms. Okay. I don't know. It just never enjoyed guys weird. I don't know. The equipment is always kind of like junk. Anyway, Jamie and I were in San Francisco. They had an equinox. It was the shit.

Speaker 2:          01:51:17       It was great. Oh my God, it was amazing. So go on the road to the hotel gyms I don't like. So I've found a bunch of like, there's some great like just hotel room workout so you can give yourself a good beating for sure. Oh for sure. Yeah, you can do one that's like the middle of the workout is 70 burpees. Oh really? That's like, that's a motherfucker. Oh fuck. Yeah. I mean, you definitely get a lot of work done in a small space and like you know, the whole workout, it's a 100 squats, 90 sit ups, 80 lunges, 70 burpees, and for a big guy like you, 100 squats, bodyweight squats is a lot of work. Yeah. Yeah. That's jacked. I'm sure my calves are shredded from kettering. My body, my whole life has probably kick a hole through a wall about how much weight he carries all the time and he's still, you know, he's got a big ass legs.

Speaker 2:          01:52:04       You got to assume that your body has to carry around that much when he gets a certain kind of a fat person because there's definitely people who get fat where it's like their limbs or doe, but I wasn't necessarily that kind of fat and I'm not that kind of fat now, but it's always my legs for some reason. I've always been like just jack from just carrying around the body weight of course. But I mean there's obviously just get those big crazy legs, but my legs have always been oddly muscular can then my body's weird. The human body's very strange in that you could change it, you can move it around, you see a rhino, it's built like a fucking rhino, but a human being can through weightlifting and diet and you know, just concentrating on stuffing your face with calories and constantly hitting

Speaker 5:          01:52:46       like heavy cleans and snatches and dead lifts. You can get way bigger. Oh yeah. You just gotTa keep doing it. You just got to keep doing it. Going backwards. This is the hardest thing. That's why that a gay pride parade was Sunday, right. That was the day I got here and I went over to the comedy store and just walking when I went to eat dinner at the rainbow bar and grill and it's right next to that one oak place which was having I guess a big gay blow out and they were all outside and like cutoff shorts and shirtless and just fantastic bodies. Every one of them and I was just like at sucks. I'm just passed an age and the damage I've done to my body just from being a fat kid growing up, it's just like there's just no, I'll never look like that ever.

Speaker 5:          01:53:31       It's always a bummer. How come you never looked like that? I'm just the morning of the body over the years had to separate game of thrones. I've modeled myself the fourth emulate stretchmarks, stretchmarks, uh, just loose skin. They would be like, we keep referencing. Lewis was funny. He said, I never referenced on the show before. Now I've said it 50 times. Louis j Gomez was 300 pounds at one point. Low. Got into a great shape, like really great. She a few years ago was like abs and everything, but still like A. I have a friend rob who, same thing was a heavyset guy. Now he's in really good shape. They put on a bathing suit still on both of them. You see like ecological, just the jiggling the body. You know what I mean? Louis will always have stretchmarks no matter what. But here's the thing. You could, I could look a thousand times better than I look, but I'll never.

Speaker 5:          01:54:28       My point just being, I'm never going to be like this fucking these statues that these guys are, you know what I mean? Just like jacked fucking Tan ad guys. I'm like, I just bummed out that I never knew what that was like ever or being, or being a thin kid or a kid in high school that could, uh, you know, just where all the clothes that were the coolest clothes that just having to get like big and tall ship. Um, what do they do? They cut your skin, right? That's one way they deal with that. When they do, you're always going to be. I've seen all that stuff, man. And I would get it. I would get it. But you're always going to be frankensteinish [inaudible], you know what I mean? You're always gonna have like, I've never seen that car. To me that's the decision of fake tits.

Speaker 5:          01:55:09       Really. It has to be. It's like you are like a part fake and there is marks to show how fake it is. You know what I mean? There's always going to be like, the nipples are always weird. You're just stretching the body and you put it into something else. It's not supposed to be, but those don't seem to mind even a little bit. Um, no, not the. Some. Some guys hate fake tits. Yeah. Yeah. I'm not a big fan of those crazy like softball ones where there's a big split in the middle and that's all with that shit. Yeah, that's an awkward look. It's like the, the canyon between titties. Yeah. That's unnecessary. I just rib cage in between it. It's weird. It's a long stretch with one going like northeast and one going northwest and they're just like perfect circles. Yeah, let's just odd.

Speaker 5:          01:55:54       Well it's, they went too hard, you know, like if you try to go to many cup sizes over like some of these girls like really lean and small girls and tits or just like fat bags golf at. Yeah, I mean they're beautiful fat bags. This doesn't say you have to like, you know, forget to put your foot in the middle of their chest and like stretch their tits skin health or wrap around this thing. It's so gross. Men, have you ever see an operation when they go in through the armpit and they got like this hook and they're digging underneath the armpit and they're creating a cavity and then they have to stuff that cavity with his bag and then fill it up with water and they just squeeze her tit for half hour. I guess they're hard. Not Hard, but solid bags now. They're not like a bag that they fill up with water now.

Speaker 5:          01:56:36       I guess the more popular one is like a softer fully formed thing that sits in your body and you have to always worry about your body rejecting it to. Oh, and the real issue. There's a. We were looking at Dick Enhancement surgery's not too long ago and they actually have where they put a fucking piece of plastic in your Dick. Like make it like try to actually lengthen, lengthen the hang, which advised to pick a Dick Surgery. That's the one I'd pick, but uh, it just seems like the risk versus reward on that one man. Well, they, they have to experiment on Dick's in order to perfect that surgery. It's not like there's a lot of donating their dicks Dick lengthening science. They've got a practice that shit on live people. I don't know how they get approval. I've never seen that go like, uh, the only videos to like any kind of dicks surgery go well.

Speaker 5:          01:57:25       It's always fucking crazy looking. Yeah, because nobody wants to admit it. Nobody wants to hear, hey, I had a four inch deck, but now I got a six look, check it out. This is what he did, but it never even ended up being like a forced it to become six. That'd be great for people. I'm just saying it's like you had like a five inch or four inch like regular Dick and now it looks like this weird, like fucking, it looks like a wiggly worm or whatever. He used to grab it and it scored out of your hands. That's what it looks like. It's just like big fat, doughy thing. It doesn't get really hard because it looks like it looks like it got stung by a bee or like, it's like there's a problem with off with poison ivy. The best surgery ever was at bucket where they put out that Baba Guy's Dick back together, remember?

Speaker 5:          01:58:06       Yeah. And really just had the Frankenstein staples across it. Yeah. He's making a face like across your for this doing for people listening. Yeah. That guy fucked after that. Like he got his dick to almost work. He did porn. It's so weird looking those still. Huh? What a crazy story. That was that guy recently who just got a. He just got Dick Transplant, right? Yeah. First ever effective. Dick's plant transplant, the United States and he worked at the bone and everything. That's a good question. So one question. No one's followed up. It's an older fella to. Yeah, he was in his fifties. And why do you need. He just lost his Dick and stepping back. Why didn't need it? Why do you need yard as well? No, it wasn't. No, that wasn't getting his dick back. He goes, oh no, he got a new Dick. Yeah, it was a transplant, but what happened to his old Dick, I want to say a car accident with his Dick, who's was driving with his foot.

Speaker 5:          01:58:58       He had a boner in two cars just because he was getting his dick sucked while he was driving. Hit the brakes and the car accident and that has happened and guys before, you know, bitten off, I don't know about bitten off, but definitely bitten. Oh yeah. Because we've gone to the hospital with their dick all fucked up because the girl hit down on it when they were driving their car. Where you ever seen those videos when the dicks like break when the girl is like riding a dicon and comes down to hard with tape. It's my. That's what I'm talking about. Anxieties I live with. That one freaks me out when the girls rotting your Dick and she's vigorously going up. I literally have to be like, you are going to hurt me if this goes haywire, like please settle down with him.

Speaker 8:          01:59:36       It's actually a his penises amputated after he had penile cancer. Oh Jesus. You got. That's a pretty good reason to get. You know, I think the first guy that ever got it wasn't an American guy. That guy may be the one that I was thinking of that had the car accident. There was a, there's one in South Africa to 21 year old who had. I'm seeing this lost it. It said he had complications after he had to have his penis for complicated.

Speaker 5:          02:00:03       Yeah. Circumcision complications that happens. People lose their dicks every year from circumcision, probably more than die rollercoaster rides. When I was in DC, uh, recently we went down by the White House and there was a big rally. Anti circumcision rally. Yeah. Yelling out facts and I don't know if they're facts. It says circumcision confirmed makes the penis smaller. I don't know if that's true. I don't know if it makes smaller, but definitely makes it less sensitive. It could probably make it smaller. Who knows about all that? Are you circumcised and you wish you weren't? Um, no. I'm okay. And you don't give a shit either way, but I don't think we should keep doing it. It's definitely barbaric. It's pointless. It doesn't do anything good. There's nothing healthy about it. It's. It's an ancient tribal ritual that people are trying to justify. The only thing that has done for the aesthetic aesthetic.

Speaker 5:          02:00:51       Yeah, but that's ridiculous. I've seen porn. We're dudes of uncircumcised dicks. Look Fun. Just like a dick with some extra skin. It looks foreign. Yeah. Did he ever got bombed out of the girl's pussy with extra skin? Does that bother you at even? A little bit? No, but I've definitely talked about those more than others. Like them. I'm. I'm in the Norton camp. A real beef. You want like a meaty one? I don't mind at all. I don't mind the meeting when I don't mind it, but I'm always like. It's interesting how it looks like real, real flappy. I don't give a fuck. It doesn't bother me at all, but the idea that they trim those is horrendous. Like that's crazy. Flips trimmed to get them cut off. It's their lobbyists. Surgery lab, a deck tummy or maybe plasty. Oh, it's awful. It's terrifying. At one point started putting like frozen in whatever plastic and Houston mafia Houston, but meanwhile that was her pussy.

Speaker 5:          02:01:39       Part of her appeal, that's what a lot of guys liked about her shadow a pussy, like a moose mouth, like probably in the eighties through the nineties. I could tell you five picture. Who's porn stars like matched up to the pussy. Really? I'm pretty sure at a time. Tara. Patrick, Jenna Jamison. Pretty Telltale. Pussies, yeah. There's. I guess there's some iconic pussies out there that that's where the flashlight came in. Remember of Vanessa del Rio had that big fucking donkey dick have a clit. Yeah, I think it was huge. Yeah. There was some gals that have a very, very endowed. I liked that in porn. I don't know if I would show a dig that in person. Yeah, and porn is dirty and real life. You'd be like, Ooh, I don't know if these are the genetics. I want my seed to swallow up.

Speaker 5:          02:02:30       There's never posted. You've seen that. You were like, ah, this one's pretty awful looking. I'm not saying you don't fuck it, but you're just like, that's pretty. Oh, in porns I have, yeah. I'm going to spend some money. Whoa, whoa. What's going on down there? What is that disaster? What the fuck is that? Something happening here and it's not good. Well, you know, you've got to think by the time you get to do porn, a lot of things have happened or haven't, but very possibly a lot of things have happened to you in this life. The northern Leslie. Yeah. Those things have an effect on everything. I mean, if your face looks all stressed out when you like had a hard life, I bet you push it looks. Look was stressed out. I mean it only stands to reason. Old Miner. He's got fucking hands that are made out of.

Speaker 5:          02:03:14       It's made out a clay. He's getting card calluses and furrowed brow. The girls 23 plus. He's a hard 52 are pussies. Yeah, exactly. Her Pussy comes up with black lung. She's smoking cigarettes. Get worried about our bills. I dated a girl one time. I had one of her pussy lips, like ran all the way down there where bud hall was weird. That's definitely weird. Not. It wasn't like Pussy Lips, the wrong word for it, but like the line that her pussy lips was on where it is geometry fan came around the hole and then it continued. The wrinkle continued all the way to where bud. Hold on. That was weird. That's definitely weird. Yeah. Otherwise we would all be going, oh, I've seen that. Someone out there. Someone out there. It's close up to the butthole. Yeah. That's a weird thing, huh? The butthole and the pussy are so close together. Yeah, but bizarre design of nature, nature, such a bizarre fucking creator. Who's the total nutrient? It's the Lord. Hello. Could you keep saying nature created? You won't evidence you have a neutral. Created the same proof you have that you know God created it. Well, this is a different type of vagina for every guy out there. I think we could safely say that testimonies of people leaving a chick because I just didn't like to wear pussy. Look, I've definitely

Speaker 2:          02:04:37       heard of that before. Yeah. I have a friend and her ex boyfriend told her a story about getting together with some girl going down on her, pulling her panties off and she has a clit that's like a pinky. Any panic had a male. He panicked and he made up some story about picking up his brother, the airport, and he ran away and he said that he knew that the girl knew that he was bullshitting and they both just sort of agreed to go along with the charade. She'd probably had seen other guys like look at her Dick, her vagina or whatever. Her clit clit Dick Freak out. She just unfortunately had an enormous. According to him. I mean he might've been a baby. You. I might've been like a little tiny little baby thumb. I'm like, come on, get over the baby thumb. Does it really bother you? That wouldn't shake me as much as like really awful tits. Isn't it funny though that like there's a line, the cross as far as like inches wise, like here like this, like let's, let's go with this finger. Like this is no big deal. Somebody deals with big clip. Hey, what's going on there?

Speaker 2:          02:05:41       Everything. Okay. I have to move it like not even a whole finger joint. Not a whole lot of like, this is okay. What the fuck is that? What is this? What is that? And then that's insane. Yeah. If you got up to the next knuckle you're doing like. I mean what is that? Like an inch. If it's an inch clit, fuck that better than she was a runaway and if it's a whole finger, you're. It's a dick. You got to go look at pictures of huge cliffs. See that's why they show will never be on a network. So curious how big they get a of all things. I have google. I've never googled that. Bodybuilders when girls take testosterone, get enormous. I used to be so Jamie's freaked out. I'm not gonna. Share it on Youtube. Okay. Don't know Jesus Christ. Seed. Those are dicks or Dick.

Speaker 2:          02:06:31       Those are dicks. That one with the girl's tongue on it down on the bottom left hand side. That might as well be a dick. Yeah. Well this is. Oh, what was the one up top? Those ones up top are dicks. That's addicted. We'll get that one that the girls spreading it out. Okay. What? What? Okay. Now did they say, is this a bodybuilder? Because that we're looking at what? It looks like a two inch Dick, but I'm talking about a train wreck. My stepfather. Jesus Christ. That's a dick. Okay. That's a deck. That is 100 percent of the Dick Ball's coming off of it. Yeah. What is going on below that monster? What is that? Very big clits. See? How do we know that this is real? We just might be. Well, that's fake, but I mean there's some. It's fake. I think there's some genetic differences. Dominations. Yeah. What's that one? The upper right hand corner where it's a snail laying on a table. Go large with that police. What the fuck is happening? That is not real, is it? She get her pussy eaten by a frog. Oh, that's a rubber Dick that's attached to a table and she's rubbing on her clit. That's what that is, but it looks like she's

Speaker 5:          02:07:36       giving birth to a snail. That's hard to explain. Yeah, there's. Okay. That's a hermaphrodite fake. It's a fake picture. Might not be, man. That's what's weird because some of these clips are like, what? That. What was that one? The upper. Just feel like we would know who that person's name is. If it was a real thing where you have a. I wish my Dick had that Kinda hang it's rod number. Thigh on the upper upper level. Okay. What is that? Real? It's hard to say. What's real. The problem is with the Internet, you just don't know what's real. Did you? Did you look up doing. Did you google the word real big? Hey. No, just huge. Clits. Real huge clits. Oh Jeez. We're going to hit another. Oh God. Those are dicks. There's a lot of dixon there. Well, what you got to wonder how many of these people are hermaphrodites? No, wait, you said you don't mind med pussy, but go pick your five on the top row. Oh, that's not meaty. That's a. it's like a butcher shop. See? But that again, is that for real? Is it 100 percent? Couldn't be real. It's got that, that inside Pussy feel to it. Just that a gritty skin feel like she got dragged by a truck on her pussy postseason on her way here. You know like tripe.

Speaker 5:          02:08:59       It's got a texture. What is that thing that's got three levels of Pussy Lips, like aliens mouth to the movie. Aliens with the little mouth comes out. It's got eyebrows. Look. Follow the eyebrows down to the. I mean that is like a. that's an orangutan orangutan. It does, right? It looks like a duck bill. It's really a wow. Pussies can be ugly. Huh? Fuck. Look at that thing. We all thought, man, there's no pussy. I'm running away from. Listens, diseased. Turns out I could just be misshapen. Well, if you look at like WC fields knows and you fly. That sort of morphing possibility and potential to a vagina. You got a Lotta of it. Could be ugly. CanNot be our secret code. If we had a girl say she had a nice chat. Chat, chat, chat, chat, chat. That was Jimmy Durante though. Same thing. Yeah. That's actually better.

Speaker 5:          02:09:58       We'll go with Jimmy Durante. WC fields that a fucked up knows, but I think Jimmy Duranti probably had a more fucked up, knows what is that knows come from alcoholism. Not always. My Dad's not a drinker at all. My Dad started to get a little bit of a bulb that will get that note. I mean not like, oof. That's a big one at church. He used to call themselves, got a clip. Like that guy made a career of having a big giant nose look. This girls kissing his knows. How strange is that? Like he became a celebrity for having a giant. Well talented comedian as well, but that was his thing is that he had a giant. No, that's not real, is it? No. That's added onto it. Yeah. It seems like it wasn't that big. Do you think he was. He didn't get famously was like older.

Speaker 5:          02:10:46       I don't know. I'm just not. Not totally aware of the history because you always got to wonder what that thing like that did it. How much did it affect is like getting an ass as a performer. He was famous. You probably stuck that right up there as well. He's got a choice 69 and it's going in your ass in your ass. He's the person who's really upset. The pussy is so close to the Esol, my leg, it might be one of those guys that likes it. When you got to knows that big, who knows what you're smelling. You might be smelling things like a dog dog. Dog seemed to enjoy really fucking stinky. Smells might be because their sense of smell is so much more potent. Let's just start that room. Or Jimmy Duranti. As Wolf powers, wolf smell senses. Smell was it explained to me in a real weird way like the differences between a person who dog, but this way is a good way.

Speaker 5:          02:11:33       If you ever want to like pictured in your head. You know how when a skunk sprays in the air, it's only a certain amount of parts per million and you could smell it. You can be nowhere near it. Well, for a dog, everything's like that. So like a skunk can spray something and he could spray something in a block somewhere and it can be. You'll be a block away like, oh, fucking skunk. And you smell it for a dog. Could smell person like that. Just always. Everything could just smell things. It's just a matter of picking these things out. So just trying to like, uh, like you hear a sound to your right and you know, instinctively your ears telling you it's in that direction. What were the dog? It's similar to that. Especially like a bloodhound or something like that. Do you know they have those long ass ears to make the smell come to their face.

Speaker 5:          02:12:15       Know when dogs are like bloodhounds, they have these crazy long ass ears that so that the smells waft up into their face when dogs, dogs, like intelligent dogs doing anything. I'm impressed when they find drugs or any of that shit or fucking in the cars as my favorite on cops when they brought the canine unit and he's like, that's cool. We don't have to search your car. You went the dog smell around the car. The dog starts like they opened the gas thing and there's always some crystal meth pipe or something in there. They tried different ways of hiding it too. That just never worked. Like you gotta you gotta put it in coffee. A good luck with that. Try getting that passed for those fucking dogs. They could smell it. You know? It's terrifying. They were bringing weed on those cruise ships. You bring pens?

Speaker 5:          02:13:03       No, I haven't. I don't have a pen. Oh No, no. Getting off some symptoms. He's randomly have the dogs. This is a good one. Pens? Yeah. That's an excellent one. I'm a big fan. Thank you. It's all you buddy. You're leaving today, right? Yup. Yeah. New York's got to get its shit together when it comes to weed. Carmen, I hope it's coming. Anything think if you're carrying an answer under. It's just a ticket. She shouldn't even be. That shouldn't be. Leave me alone. Stupid. Do you believe in smoking on the streets and everything? No, I don't think you should be able to do anything on the streets. It's going to affect anybody else's health. Should be treated like alcohol. Yeah. Well the problem with smoking is you can hotbox people you know, so like if you decided to smoke pot in a nightclub filled with people, you can get people around you high.

Speaker 5:          02:13:57       That's sure that's happened on this podcast. One hundred percent. We've gotten people high that were just sitting there and they've got a contact high 100 percent. So interesting. That was bullshit. Recently. Say that, but it's not. It's not. Have you ever done that place? Yeah, I'll have to talk about it. It's the only place where if you do a set where I love it and people smoke so much weed, they're like the green out, so you'll be performing a show in that. Some guy gets up and he goes, I gotta go and then he has to go in a hallway while a nice lady. Patches like rubs his head while he leaves, like lay on the ground right there. Triply there when triply didn't smoke weed. Really? Yeah. And uh, he was just crisp, defied by the time he went up on stage, there's no air in the room.

Speaker 5:          02:14:42       It's all smoke and breathing and pot smoke. There was no ventilation. Dave Smith who was just here A. Yeah, it did it. Did he tell you he did it not too long ago? No, I didn't like the weekend before he came out here. He did it and uh, he was not smoking weed for about six months. He stopped and then he's right back. Can't go. They're not. Well, they changed the coolest. Yeah. I'm not sure because money couldn't guess, uh, probably sells weed, but it's a cool little spot. It's a cool little spot, but if you don't smoke weed you cannot go because you can't stay in there for a length of time because you realize it's a different temperature in that room than the room right next to it. Don't smoke. It's just pure people had a bong at every table. But it's such a fun crowd though.

Speaker 5:          02:15:25       Two great kids, they don't get stoned, like removed, like they get, like they actually sink in the watch company. They, it's definitely like very pro. So it was very few people in there that it's like their first time there. I did it with the iron cheek. Really? Yeah, that's fucking hilarious. Brought the iron sheik on stage and then he'd love it. Oh, he had a great time. He poor guy. He's got real bad hips. His hips are fucked up I think is nice too. He's got some serious wear and tear on his body from all that wrestling because he was like a real legit wrestler at one point in time and like the uh, what was his bodyguard for the Shaw? Yeah, for the shop around. Yeah. He's a bad motherfucker. But uh, yeah, he was there. I guess he smokes a lot of weed. Was he fun to talk to at all or is he like, is he taking him like 20 minutes and you're like, all right, it's plenty. I had a good time talking to him because first of all, I remember him from when I was a kid. He's always been like this famous wrestler and he's just a, he's just there. He is right there. It's great

Speaker 9:          02:16:29       us under version function, but I want to ask Joe, what is the top left corner quarter or that the toughest sport in the Olympics? His freestyle wrestling served. I'm certain he knows what he talks kids.

Speaker 5:          02:16:57       He's a guy man. He likes to pull his dick out. Of course. Why not? He's seven years old. He doesn't give a shit. Don't get along. It looks like you already know. I didn't. That's a great one too. What is it called? Just called chic on Netflix. That's great. Yeah, totally. Yeah, and it's, it's him and his wife not getting along. It's just him and his just as life in general, like not working out, just kind of sad. It's kind of sad to kind of prop them up and send them out to do stuff and like you always kind of make a living. He just goes and now his new thing is just to kind of like freak out on people, but he's still like mad and Hulk Hogan like really? Because it never broke Keith and he doesn't know that it's Kayfabe like he's never bright. He still is to pissed off as he goes. Hulk Hogan promised me a rematch at the Madison Square Garden and you're like, she didn't know what he promised me at the greatest arena where the squirt gun and a rematch for the title. He never gave it. Like, this is meg. Oh, he's always on. I guess like he was ducking him.

Speaker 5:          02:18:08       I guess he's just always on. I mean that's his business. Got bigger fish to fry. What happened to his daughter? I know I'm jumping all over the place. Uh, his daughter. What about her? She wasn't going. She was in the public eye for awhile and then I realize how stupid it will still be in the public eye. She's like, fuck this. She was making music and shit. I like when people realize how gross it is to have people attack you and they're like, oh, back away from this. You know, I can remember when a real housewives. Kelsey grammer's. Yeah. Ex wife was she tried to be the current. Yup. And they did the fucking attack, the assault. She was like, Hey, uh, we're good. I'm out. Bailed. Like he just disappeared from the public eye. Like entirely. I slipped away because she wasn't desperate enough. It's what it is like when you, when you need to.

Speaker 5:          02:18:56       That's when you have the desperation of wanting fame. She, they want fame already have the money. Right? Like wanting fame and needing the money is such a different thing. That's why the bad girls club show is the greatest thing on TV. Oh, put a up a trailer for it. If you're listening, this is going to be good. They just get. They get like we talked about this eight pieces of garbage and then they just fucking make them drink and stuff. I'm going a goddamn house for three for three months and it's, it's they have to go to the hospital for the fights. One of Europe's this year showed up in the first day she was there. The other girl just said she was these fat pitches or try to ruin my birthday and picked up like a rocks glass and bounced it off. The girls. Hey, like splitter, eyeopener and the other thing is like they have 15 girls per season because eight of them get kicked off and they have to bring in replacements. Christ season 14, season 15. See if you can find the season. Tina's this year. This the one I just watched that's not just grow it. Go run this, run this.

Speaker 5:          02:20:07       They feed them booze morning til night. Girls just digging stuff ass. We're back bitches. It says Los Angeles, California ladies. What happened in this time?

Speaker 6:          02:20:22       There was a women that came earlier. The three of us got a little bit more and we proceeded to go on about all the other things will stay here in the house and they proceeded to destroy all of our personal belongings in the house. It looks like a tornado because isn't going to give me any way

Speaker 5:          02:20:52       they do. They broke up each other's money like their animals, so they just can't like the worst people. They could find. Make them fuck with each other. There are. These are all girls that in two seconds, if you would just give them a porn contract, they would do it, but they figure they want to sell more porns by being a part of the show. Then you're the girl from the bad girls club. Why am, why am I not hearing about this more often? This show is is fantastic. They are the worst people. It's garbage and then what they do is then they, they, they, you know, they filmed the whole season, they edit it, then they air it now while they're airing it. These girls now watch the show and they see that all the girls they thought was their friend shit talk behind their back or so they were using them for something, all the confessional shit and they're just build up this more. As much as they already hate each. Oh, now they're more irate than they have like a three part reunion. They had to break it into three parts. When people get arrested, like during the show, all real 100 percent real. They got arrested during the reunion show. What kind of a person produces a show like this genius guy. He's been reading my mind.

Speaker 5:          02:22:19       Yeah, because man, it's sure. Fire attainment, they're going to fuck up, right? They're not going to get along great. They just. They cut out the middleman of. Of all the real world was a show based on alcohol that shows where it took off. Where it got exciting was when it'd be fueled like no one cared about. This one's trying to get a job in animation in this girl's and aspiring singer. It's like, no. It goes, what happens when you. When that fucking member, the guy put his finger in the guy's aids peanut butter and then that was a whole thing like that's what people want to see. They've cut out all of that, like shit of like watching live their lives and have real emotional conversations and just get them boozed up and then they're like, girls were going go karting today, and then they go kart drunk and then they're like, this bitch thing.

Speaker 5:          02:23:07       She's a better than me. She bumped in front of me. I was supposed to be next in the go kart and that bruise. Then they get dressed for the night and they go out and they fight and fucking bars and limos. Then they come home and take off their shit and put on better fighting clothes and then continue. The fight gets kicked out. Every episode has two fights. He should be in spokesperson. Why don't you narrate the show? What we wanted to do is I want to do a live show where we get transcript, companion. I want to know, trying to get transcripts of bad girls club. We just have dudes reek is if you read what they say with any kind of rational tone of something is it will be a be a fucking nightmare. Is actually a great idea for a show. I'm in fucking dude fights they've had this year particularly.

Speaker 5:          02:23:53       It goes, uh, I'm over there trying to work and this bitch is like, you know, she tried to work next to me. She was writing my workspace and it's like, the bitch can't work like me. You shouldn't be on the same level. And then it's like having fights like his face. He goes, bitch, because you ain't on my level. That's why I'm up in your face because you ain't on my torque level. And then. And then one girl goes, they throw a punch and then the confessionals were all like, I buy that bitch knows who could work now and there's blood. They throw toasters. It's insane. I just hurt my eye from laughing. I got pulled something in my. I was laughing so hard. All right. I'm in, but if we can get a transcript, freezer belly room show. Yeah. I'm sit there and read the transcript.

Speaker 5:          02:24:38       If you guys want to practice, shut the fuck up. Okay, let's do it. Is this bad? Makes a little larger from the episode. The Ugly Duckling. It was a season. Ward Tunisia, Tunisia now hosts all the reunions. She's a big fat black lady. Hm. It's hard to know if you have to. You have to give them and find the arguments yet. That's the thing. Yeah, because they're just doing them in general, but the whole episode would take anyway, but just finding like a fight, like when they start getting into it like a torque level flight and then they try to have them be like emotional moments like with like a life coach. But that show will be so much better if you were narrating it. Oh, I love. Since you're such a fan, you should reach out to them. It really should.

Speaker 2:          02:25:24       Do they have a narrator? Nope. What they do now, just like the Internet of Commercial Shit, bad girls club. If you hire Jay Oakerson to be your narrator, I will do everything I can to promote your show. I will. I will help. I will. I will put it on twitter. I'll make an instagram post and it'll never stop out on the podcast. Let's make it happen. You got you got you got a gold mine here and do it. He could do it in an afternoon. He'll do the whole season. There is a

Speaker 5:          02:25:50       say a, uh, every season. There's always a new batch of people who were idiots and want to do it. It's a great idea. They also, I think I started to find out now that behind the scenes that reality stuff, like they'll pull from other shows, like the cast offs of something else. Like somebody tried to, in fact the girl selling this year, she tried to be on the real world and she didn't get the real world. But then she got a call from another producer a few days later. I was like, Hey, you want to try to be on this show? And she was like, yeah, sure. Because they just

Speaker 2:          02:26:16       be on TV. Yeah. Well Shit. The people that did fear factor that uh, did the casting for fear factor. They also did the casting for a lot of other shows too. And they would do it that way. You know, I don't work for this. You might work for them. They find people that are like fun and they go, Oh, this guy's like, you do become like a player. Like you become like a, a role player. Like, Oh, this guy, he's the coach them to. They sit down with them and they go, look, got to be. Remember how we talked about it before. You're going to be like really, really pissed off at him because he's, he's the guy that had been disrespecting you. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Don't let him do that because this is going to be on TV. Okay. And you can get them back, but you gotta you gotTa really get them back.

Speaker 2:          02:26:56       Okay. Got To really get them back and you're gonna get a lot of air time and so they'll, they'll like coach these people go, oh yeah, yeah. So you're watching like this artifact. And the reality of reality shows is that it's all just, it's almost like a curb. Your enthusiasm thing with like untalented people. The scenarios are painted out. They kind of know what's going to happen before they get there and they just play it out with their awful personalities. But these pieces of shit hate each other. They are dead people. Every one of them stayed behind. None of them.

Speaker 5:          02:27:27       But I think if the show is just a wildly hilarious, I'm in, I made any of that. Like uh, like reality stuff like that started with that, that show they had years back about all the talk shows like Maury Povich back to Jenny Jones and all that shit. Yeah. Like same thing, like they really do a prey on the weak in a lot of ways. Like, Oh yeah, like these chicks are kind of asking for it. But uh, and I, and as I said before, like I kind of liken that to springer now where there's just like people who are like, what do they make up? The stories are not. It's like, hey, we're going to go fake fistfight on Jerry Springer, show over a fucking, you know, scrawny Hispanic guy. And they kind of worked that out and they give them booze and they incite them to do it.

Speaker 5:          02:28:11       But the way they laugh at like these are they're telling like life falling apart stories and the way that you could even get the person who's like, you know, your boyfriend's fucking your sister or you already have a kid with the Guy Kinda Shit at some point of the show. The fact that she smiles and giggles at all, you're like, this is not that real to her. You know what I mean? Like they're making this up to some degree because why would she, you would never laugh. Like you probably genuinely leave the show, but they go to them with booze and they kind of liked that, lead them in a direction and do it. But when they did that years ago, it wasn't always just like, you know, cheating shitter who's the father those shows would try to do like, you know, people have tried to cut off their own, like Dick's, but you know, because they hate their own dick, you know, try to get, he's gripping news type things.

Speaker 5:          02:28:59       And same thing with them is they would get them all. Like they'd get these nervous people just boost them up like that. Really is like preying on the weak, just getting them like, am I just go get hammered and give it a shot I guess, but if somebody doesn't eat the wounded lay antelopes than the wounds, antelopes will continue to make their way into the waterhole. Sure. Crocodile will starve. Jerry Springer's a crocodile and all those jumps on that show their wounds antelopes he's a genius in way. I mean, so some of that 25 years we looked that up. It's still going 25 years. I'm still brand new up. Shout out to my friend Pete. The cop from Pete is one of the, uh, security guards on there. He was on season one, a fear factor. Oh really? Yeah. He's Andre Arlovski's buddy. Is he the guy who does the start?

Speaker 5:          02:29:41       That's always one of the one. Jerry Springer was just go start the chance. I don't think he does that. He's big handsome. Applicant fellow. He's a legit cop. Yeah, it lacks. The last time I saw him, he's actually recovering from gunshot wounds. Really? Yeah. He got shot on the job and shot in the arm. Jesus. Yeah. They had a cast on his arm or a sling on his arm is pretty fucked up. Whereas the Acom Chicago in Chicago. Yeah. Chicago is a scary spot to be a cop. They do spring or in Connecticut now. I wonder if that's why get the fuck out of Chicago. Not a bad idea. Probably cheaper too. I mean that's probably why espn is there, you know? Okay. I get now. Yeah. Espn has been in Connecticut and it's real close to a New York wwe headquarters. Like a lot of people like rich folks live in Connecticut and make that trip to Manhattan.

Speaker 5:          02:30:26       I know that's what letterman used to do to what Baba booey does. Does he? Yeah. He lives in Connecticut. No, Shit. That's a long ass drive. It's more than an hour. Easy. I could be an hour. Yeah, maybe really bad now if you leave at a good time, it can be an hour. If you go into the stern studio, you're going to Sirius, Sirius Xm, and then you've got to go back to Connecticut and your whole day. Yeah. You're. You're getting home at like the show's over 11 by the time they get to see him walking out. What time do you think he leaves? I see him walking out sometimes. Rarely 3:00 PM or so. Yeah, because he's got work to do after the show's over. So he's probably catching the first wave of traffic back to Connecticut Western wrap up show recently. And when I came out they were like sterns gonna walk by.

Speaker 5:          02:31:08       They were Kinda like, you know, I don't like shake his hand or talk to him at all. And I was like, Nah, that Kinda bummed me out. That somewhat even like, have to tell you that. Wait a minute, what? Say That again? Start and walk. I did the wrap up show, which is not, it's John Haydn and Gary. Right. And when I was leaving and going back out to the lobby there, external to walk by and they were like, yeah, I don't like, you know, they're basically give me like a don't try to like, you know, hey, how are. Yeah, I mean I wasn't going to anyway, but I am a huge fan, but I was like why would they say that my guests, because Howard doesn't want to like to shake hands, but maybe like again, it could be one of those things where they're protecting somebody who doesn't, who's not asking to be protected so much, but who knows, you know what I mean?

Speaker 5:          02:31:51       That's a bummer. Yeah, and dice will get there, but dice I can make happen. I'd like to make that happen. I really went back in La a probably be a month or so. Okay. But when you're back, Holler at me twice in the two of you guys sit down together and do a podcast together. I told her, eleanor, I'm like, try to get them to watch my special on Friday. Don't do that. He would love you though. He would love it. I think he was a good guy. You'd see how inspired is by like his thing. Yeah, for sure is he's a good guy. He's a fun dude and he's A. Yeah, he's, you know, like we both agreed. It's very important. Very important. That will be a kick for like for like my step pops was able to call my step up after and be like, yeah, we just hung out.

Speaker 5:          02:32:35       Like we really. He was such a big part of me and his like friendship, you know what I mean? Me and my stepfather being like me thing was pumps. Pretty cool. He would love that. Yeah. Next time you're in town, I'll definitely set that up. Yeah, let's do it. He's at the store all the time. He takes time off, standing up and then gets back to it. But he's doing that showtime show now. Here show. It's called dice. Yeah. Yeah. Duh. I'm like, what is the truth? But he did that other show too. It's eight is an HBO show. Who's doing what? Who's making it? Showtime. Right. Showtime and associate comedy store type show, but that's not that. But he was. He played a part in something. Something else. Oh yeah, he was on vinyl. That's right. Hbo, the Vinyl Show. Yeah. It was only on an episode, but he was fucking great. He's a good actor, man. He's really good in that Woody Allen movie too. Jasmine. I saw that too. I thought it was fantastic in that we think about that woody allen thing. What's a little weird, right? Which thing? Bangs his daughter just in general. A little weird, but it's not as daughter. Right? That's the at the end, but it's basically his daughter allegedly. Yeah. I mean that's, you know, he looks like a drawing of a guy who fucks his daughter.

Speaker 5:          02:33:46       Really? Here's the caricature of that guy. Yeah. I have a woody allen stand up a CD, whatever you wanna call it album. It's on my phone and when I play I'm going to have the Bluetooth linked up to my car. It's the first thing, one of the first things that plays the Thomson one, but it's a, it's, it's because it's the letter a is the beginning of the thing and when I plug in my ipod at ace of spades starts playing every time. It's a uh, it's a weird. It's a weird album because not knowing that is kind of kinked up sexually. Like you see how weird he was, like, you know, like it kind of like snuck under the radar because he was as nebbishy little Jewish guy, but he was like letting everybody know he was a pervert. Like from the jump. Yeah. I mean his voice, he has a natural voice of the fake voice you would do as a guy who's like a creep. You know what I mean? Like he lives with that voice. Yeah. It's fucking bizarre. Can you do an woody allen, woody Allen and dice clay together now? Yeah. I don't know. I couldn't do in bed together.

Speaker 5:          02:34:57       Take it. You fucking Jew. Oh, as I. Anthony Kumi always did a great dice man because like it's getting like the detail of the oppression of the Ha. Just like, just like, yeah, it was just like saying hon for something. It's nice. Yeah. Anthony Kumina can do a bunch of different pressures. He's a very good impressionist. Yeah, he's great. Yeah. He's that dice used to like when they did a, if you ever want to listen to a few seconds of, uh, when he does, dice gets religious. It's on youtube. I've heard that. Yeah, it's a fucking with us. The footprints poem was like, Jesus, I come one. There was only one at my hardest terms. There's only one set of footprints. Why did you leave me? You fucking scumbag. He goes, that's what I was carrying you and I cried.

Speaker 5:          02:35:50       Goes broke down. It was. I was over here. Now I'm over here now with the Lord. I'm over here. Are you guys on [inaudible] network? No, not anymore. You were just left [inaudible] that work? Yeah, we're on gas digital network now. Why is everybody on the sky explaining network to me? What's the benefit of being on network? Uh, exposure to Anthony's thing was to. Anthony's a audience was nice for the time we were there. It was great. Um, the way we're doing it now. I really like this may be the, one of the only things that does make sense to me. It's the gas digital thing is all of us in all of our kinds of other things. So I do the SDR show sex, drugs, rock and roll show I do with Ralph Sutton. Um, that's just where we interviewed porn stars. And music people, he has a connection to all music people in porn stars.

Speaker 5:          02:36:38       So we interviewed them, a legion of skanks nails, me Louis and Dave Lewis has the real last podcast he does by herself. Dave, that's part of the problem, which is the political when he does and it's all in the same, you know, it's like all kinds of friends kind of, you know what I mean? So it's like if you like one of these, you'll like all of them. You know what I mean? Like we're going to be like, oh, but if you like elements of them, there's something kind of for everyone in this grouping of like this click of comics, I guess I'll see you guys have created your own network. They did. Yeah. Lewis. And I'm Ralph Lewis and Ralph's. That sets gets Gomez in Sutton gas. That makes sense. Okay. So then besides that, I don't actually know. I don't know what the, what the benefits, unless you're exposing yourself to an audience, like I said, for doing bonfire that show I do on Sirius Xm on comedy central radio.

Speaker 5:          02:37:24       That's been amazing in so many ways because it's very discoverable. You're not playing to like just this core audience, like that's people just in their cars but on comedy central and we're doing this talk show times a week. Like that's, that's done like huge on the road and stuff like go on the road, like people showing up to clubs. Like that's amazing how that hits. So is that on serious? Yeah, that's such a radio. Yeah, it's great. We're going to be extended the days of that soon. So this is weird because they really, they're paying Howard and they pay and Jimmy, but everybody else is like, well that's the beauty of our situation is we are not employees of serious. Yeah. Comedy central works at a contract with serious for their network to beyond. And then we are, we're employees of Viacom. Oh, so they pay you?

Speaker 5:          02:38:12       Yeah. Oh that's great then. Yeah, that makes sense. Yup. And with, we've done it for almost a year now. We'll get an alert when your anniversary. It's going to be great and it's cool celebrations, man in Louis and uh, and my girlfriend both putting in that skank fest thing is going to be really neat. Like Stan hopes coming in for it and heard todd glass is company wide. He makes me laugh. He's so and yeah. So I'm excited to get a few people in its first year we're doing it. So t how todd glass was the. Well not talking about. Yeah. Was it todd glass that a design help design? I think it was that helped design helium. Oh yeah. Well that's right. I think. Yeah, I'm pretty sure we talked about it when he was here. Yeah. Yeah. Alex. nice atmosphere. Like he figured it out. He nailed it.

Speaker 5:          02:38:55       Um, so Friday night, is it Friday or Saturday? You comedy central special. It's Friday night into Saturday. Midnight. It's midnight at Saturday technically, but it's Friday night. Dave said it's fucking awesome man. Uh, Dave Smith. Yeah, he was there for. Yeah, it was a, it was a hell of a nightmare. It was really a, it was above my inbox, above and beyond my expectations which doing at Webster Hall in New York. I'm going to see too that we had a $600 per show and it was great. We filled it with all fans. We just did it. I got the the band when I went on tour with corn. I, like I said, I was like wigging out about that. It shouldn't be what I should have gotten to in that story was when I got on the tour going through all this anxiety, like the second day, the support act on that tour as a band called two cents and it's just these like this wild dudes from like Malibu basically and some of them from Malibu silver from riverside, but they're just like, they were at a control for like fun guys, but I mean like just there on their fucking route, first tour bus tour ever for them.

Speaker 5:          02:39:59       Like they were all excited but they just got, took me in. They just became like real good friends and they love. There was a comedian on the tour and they watched and laughed and supported constantly and so when I got this special I was able to get comedy central to fly those guys out and they play like the intro, we make it like a rock show. And they did, they blew Cryo jetson and they were on stage with you are the big backdrop of, uh, of the Legion of skanks logos behind me. So you're onstage and they were like off to the side while you're up there? Yeah. Oh Nice. Yeah. And they're in the dark, but you can kind of see them like lit up with it because there's like a glow in the dark logo over by the djs booths. It's was, it was cool to be able to like involve them like that.

Speaker 5:          02:40:40       That's cool. That's very cool. We made it a big, big. It's funny, I was just huge like rock show, you know, Marilyn Manson inspired opening and then uh, and then I sit on a stool for our comedy. Central's taken some fucking chances, man. I like what they're doing. I like the art show already shows amazing. Yeah. He take some big chances with that. They're taking a big chance with his roast battle show very big. They took a big chance on me. It was, it was a work. It was a real like, uh, when I got it, I was why I got so emotional about it really was because, uh, it shows like it came kind of out of nowhere because three years ago I pitched him that idea. I mean, David Tell, doing his comedy underground thing, broke down some walls over there for like producing a show.

Speaker 5:          02:41:21       Their issue was never being showing dirty stuff. They would acquire someone special in plate after midnight, doesn't matter to them, but putting the money out to produce a special that I pitched them. I was like, let's produce a special that's dirty uncensored and just show it late night, you know, but like we'll make that like a thing, make it that it's cool to watch it after midnight. And uh, they just shut the idea down. But they were like, they liked me, you know, and they kind of like hung in there and I give them tapes and they'd come back with a bunch of red notes. You can't say this, you can't say that. I kind of just checked out of it even being a possibility and then like one day and all the little pieces, you know, I said and, and, you know, make no mistake you letting be, be, uh, exposed to your audience like this or would Ari's done for me.

Speaker 5:          02:42:07       So many people. You know what I mean? It's countless list of it. Ron Bennington, Bennington, sure. Exposing his fans. Like all these little pieces came together. I mean like he fought for me to be on that storytelling show. I was the only newer comic. There was no other comics from New York. They brought out a. Now they are. But the first two ones I did, I was the only New York comic and the first one they didn't want me. I think they're realizing that the Internet has kind of changed the the level they changed the bar and you, the television sensors are only getting in the way of commerce like you're fucking it up because the people can do uncensored shit in other places like Netflix. Netflix doesn't give a fuck. They don't care. They gave me zero notes and now you can say the. Now you can say shit balls and pussy on tbs know what I'm saying?

Speaker 5:          02:42:54       Like on channels like tbs now shift. They're all close. Yeah. Cable is not governed by the FCC. It's only governed by what the advertisers are willing to tolerate it. So they were always able to change the own. That's why I said IFC, that was their big thing. Like how can I have you just have like nudity and cursing on their channels. Like they were like, damn, this lady told me they go any because my show is Iraq was on ifc and we had nudity and cursing. I was like, how is this okay? And they go, any like MTV could do that if they wanted to. It was just like they'll lose their core of what they're trying to get you as an advertising audience. Maybe not for them. You know?

Speaker 2:          02:43:30       That was the big thing with Dave Chappelle, the Dave Chappelle when he was doing the Dave Chappelle show, they were trying to get him to change the language because they would get more advertisers. They were, they were telling him he couldn't say nigger anymore. They were trying to like cut down on the amount of this and the amount of that. They were just looking at dollar signs. They were looking at taking this cultural phenomenon and juicing the blood out of it. They could of course, yeah. I mean that's what they do mean that they're not creative. They're not artists.

Speaker 5:          02:43:57       People in suits make all the decisions though somehow until you get to that point that Louis ck thing is like, uh, you know, or, or like you said, what you've done here is really like, you know, amazing. Like you give this for free the show and you give people like hours and hours of content a week. You know what I mean? But it's all on your thing. You have an audience bigger than, I mean a comedy central person said to me yesterday, I go, as I'm doing, uh, I'm doing the Joe Rogan experience tomorrow and promoting the special. He goes, oh, that's going to be better than, than that midnight at midnight tonight. That's going to be a TV show. Like this is hits way bigger audience. You know what I mean? And you've done it on your own way. That's like, that's fucking great.

Speaker 2:          02:44:35       We just kept doing it to just keep doing it. And the thing that is for me, it's like, it's not like it's the easiest thing in the world to do in the sense that it's fun, like just show up and you know, take care of all the pieces that have to be put into place as far as like how it gets uploaded and where it goes and how it gets distributed through itunes. It becomes pretty fucking easy. And when it reaches the numbers that it's at now where it gets to be like TV show numbers, it's it. And there's no end to that. There's no like there's no cap to it and it doesn't cost anything, so for me it's just, it's all fun.

Speaker 5:          02:45:12       Your numbers drop for two months, a little bit. There's no one looming over you. So I'm saying to go, it's like whoa. I noticed like, you know, in this or not even when your numbers drop, but it's like you picking up some here but you're losing the people in Wisconsin right now. Who gives like why would you even give a shit about that?

Speaker 2:          02:45:30       I would have never made it the way it is. There's no way they would've advised me to pick more popular people as far as like guests as far as like a really famous people instead of like authors are weird. Scientists are interesting. People that I think would be fun to talk to by doing it on my own. I'm able to do the whole thing, like book it, you know, decide when. If we know today, you know, like we're going to do it at one. We both ran late. We just fucking 1:30 gives. You could have done it too. It doesn't matter. It's not like everything else. Can be done, they're watching like pounding a thing like come on guys and it's not a thing in the world that can reach millions of people like this that has three people involved in it. You, me and Jamie

Speaker 5:          02:46:10       right now. That's it. How far away before they're coming in to regulate it? Just like the free airwaves. I think they can. I think the genie's out of the bottle. I think it's too late. I don't think people will tolerate it. I don't think it's possible at this point without any sort of a massive blow back. The blowback culturally and politically would be so significant that I think it would. It would devastate whatever political party leaned towards that because the, the ire of the Internet would be completely focused on them. Anybody who tried to censor the Internet at this point in time, we really try to step in and say that podcast like, you know, no more, no more saying nowhere. You know, you have to figure out when you can, can say certain things and how nonprofit said it's a genie gets out of the bottle.

Speaker 5:          02:46:55       It's the sort of the thing with like, uh, like what was the time of the process of like cell phone, regulatory, whatever was remember cell phone bills were like, if you use them genuinely during the day with any regularity, your bill is going to be like 700, $800 dollars or one point. The words got to the point where it's just, there's no more after 7:00 PM that holy, she's like a sham. The whole thing which is a shampoo keep like gouging people go, this is going to become the new communication and, and they'll figure it out around self, what they did. Magic Jack Shit like that, you know what I mean? Or a orange Internet calling, you know, and all that stuff comes around and it's like you got to make cell phones just like a regular bill payment that's like, you know, affordable for everybody. Well one, you already have Sirius satellite radio which completely uncensored in your car.

Speaker 5:          02:47:39       Everybody has that. I mean, it's so common. So many new cars come with that. So what's the difference between data and podcast? Nothing. Well, podcast is getting in your cars. They're gonna, they're gonna run on four g like I already have podcast. Most people do have a podcast app on my phone and when I download something or when I subscribed to something, it automatically downloads to my phone. So when I'm driving around I just press play and it goes here and we're in. The best thing about it is if a phone call happens, the car pauses it and then you answered the phone call, you talked to somebody and then you hang up and then the podcast plays where you left it off. It's not like radio, it's not like satellite radio. It's better than all those things with the on demand now it's pretty good.

Speaker 5:          02:48:21       It helps. They are, there should be on the Internet. Why does it have to go up to the sky and come back down the fuck you ain't go. No, it doesn't. Ultimately. And the thing is like they might, but they might, uh, like serious may jump into that world of they are like, a lot of the channels are bringing podcasts too serious now. It's a good thing, which is a good thing. That's a very good thing. It's all good. It's all good in a way, but you err on, on open channel. Right. But it's an, it's an antiquated way of broadcasting things. It's stupid. It doesn't make any sense anymore. It's just like that. The time is done. Like that smoke signals you're saying when the godfathers gone, that's where I think when sterns done, um, all this stuff will really take on. I don't think he's going anywhere five years. He was four and a half more years. He'll stay. They're

Speaker 2:          02:49:08       going to, they're going to pay him so much fucking money. The deal actually though, it's 12 year deal. It's five. It might be a little off on this, but I'm pretty sure I followed it's five years on air from about six months ago or so. And then they own where they get rights to play his entire catalog for seven more years. Oh, after that, I think he's dumb. He's going to be 67 years old and he's done this one. It looks good though. It was great. But it means obviously still relevant show business. Otherwise you wouldn't have done America's got talent. He, he wants to be relevant. Right. Wild. Why? Why do you fly back to California all the time to do that stupid show where they actually did it in New York? Did they? They moved to New York for me. Just shut the fuck up.

Speaker 2:          02:49:52       Um, I just don't. I just think it's a part of who he is. I mean, maybe he take some time off, but I could see it would be fun if he started fucking podcast. Everyone said to me so much money. He's trying to stand behind that argument he had with Ari so bad. It was so silly. It was, it was the first chicken is armor I ever saw. Well really, like, just not even blindly, uh, just to. Because always my friend is just like, it was the first thing he was just kind of wrong about like, you can make a living off this, but he's way wrong. I make more money from this than a lot of other things I do. Yeah. You can make more money doing podcasts then you definitely can look at working on a local radio station, which is what he was.

Speaker 2:          02:50:31       Sure. Yeah. It's like, and doing overnight shifts and the thing is that is still the shitty process in many ways for some people, but if they're doing that, but there's a difference between being a radio announcer, an entertaining podcast, you know, there's not a lot of Howard stern's, you know, it's like the difference between, you know, if you want to be an mc at a strip club. No, no, I don't want to be an MC to strip club. I work as an MC district go because I need some time on stage. Right. Then, then you become a standup, like what you want to do, standup, blah. You got to learn how to bring up those strippers and get to really know how. No, I don't have to learn how to be funny. That's it. So yeah, I'm just trying to work out a muscle here, buddy.

Speaker 2:          02:51:05       It's like this isn't. His argument was weird. Like you have to learn how to do a break for a commercial stuff in music or any of that. By the way. Not only that, like, wow you to work your way up through broadcasting and some local job like nobody wants to do that. You want to work for somebody, why would you do that? And this idea that like podcasts are for losers. I get he like, he's probably in a negotiation with serious at the time we saying all this stuff and it's probably part of him wants to like, look, the guy had ultimate power for so long. He had the ability to, the ability to make or break careers by shitting on you with no recourse. And Ari who was one of the first guys that owned him, he owned them. That video that he did and he did it politely.

Speaker 2:          02:51:49       Shit all over him on my show. Mr Stern. And then he owned him with that video where, because you know how it was trying to say he's a nobody and then he points to always get a photo of him with a billboard on sunset boulevard. He's got to hit comedy central TV show. His second comedy central special was airing that we, uh, I mean it was, it was bad timing. I said he really picked the wrong mark, but the thing is, because Howard is a, one of the things and he's he showed that I think are in many ways in America's got talent and he shows it with like how he has with guests. He has come in and when he talks about on the errors and he's got like, I don't disagree with all of it, but like he's got some pretty horrible opinions on standup comedy.

Speaker 2:          02:52:29       I mean it's just like he was, he would not be my gauge for who to watch or who to know who to listen to. His little disconnected. So he does it. It's dumb that he doesn't know who he is. Girl that's comics in the world. He's one of the top 100 standup comics in the world. That's just a fact. And if you, you know, you don't agree with that, it's because you're not talking to comics. That's what I mean. He's not like, he knows like, but he's not being logical. It's just trying to crush him. He's trying to crush crush art because already called him. An old man, told him to suck clinics. Eastwood's old man Dick, because he hated the Chris Kyle movie. It's fucking funny, man. Like art. He's a, he's a gangster but, but already set them up. He set him up. He knew stern was gonna attack him, stern attacked him and already had a video response that which is measured and polite.

Speaker 2:          02:53:16       Showed, showed it. Howard had to get on Google. He's like, I don't know what you're using. Probably Netflix navigator, a lot of you old folks into the Internet. Let me show you how to find my name and see. There you go. Red. She fear. Oh look at all this stuff about me. Look at all this stuff. And he owned a man. You know, it's funny that people in his studio knew that, but I've talked to people that worked there that were like, eh, that was like a rough horse, you know? They were like, they were like, that was because they said like I was saying, I was like, did you guys just want to like, run in there and be like, Howard, just like, we just let this one go because he's got comics that work for them essentially, and they know what it is and like you said, but in that thing he's the boss, you know, you got to let him do his thing and he just didn't know the a thing anymore.

Speaker 2:          02:53:58       He's so used to crushing people too. He's so used to his whole career. He's had this ultimate power where he could just shit all over you like you did with mad cow with a lot of these other guys and he just crushed them all. Crushed them all. But the playing field's different now, you know, wildly. It's different. I mean he, if he comes on my podcast and shits on Stern, $2, million people are gonna hear and see that. Yeah, that's a lot. And if it then it gets a viral video on youtube and then it gets on twitter and facebook. People start spreading it around back and forth. Those things will hit hundreds of thousands of views like that and you, you don't have the ultimate like, like field advantage anymore. Like everybody can be a broadcaster now. I mean, what, what did you doing?

Speaker 2:          02:54:45       You're showing something broadly, right? In the loosest sense of the definition of the word. Well anybody can get on youtube and be a broadcaster in that sense. Anybody can get on a podcast and it didn't use to be like that. And he used to be. When Howard did it, he would do it for. I mean, look, he wielded his power correctly. He knew how to handle it and he was dealing with a lot of competitive people that we're trying to take his spot and you know, he would go after them and crush them with is, you know, 20 plus million at one time. People listening to him every morning. So if you had some rinky dink as radio show with 100,000 people listening and you're, you know, in Philadelphia where the war, he could smash you. It wasn't a damn thing you could do about it and no one heard you shit on him and no one could exchange it back and forth. There was no youtube. There was no way for your voice to get viral. You only had the operation.

Speaker 5:          02:55:37       Why that one guy said, Julia heroed, everyone that, uh, he's a great guy. Tom Bernard in Minneapolis. Like, that's the only town where like, he came into the challenge. Tom Bernard's morning show in like last, like star was there and going like very quickly on thing under a year. I wonder what happened. They just said if everyone's, everyone's stuck by that Tom Bernard show, he still is a radio guy there. Tom Bernard kidding? Older guys. He has like a scarface mansion in that town. He really. Oh yeah man. He's like, how do I not know this? Kind of surprised. Yeah,

Speaker 2:          02:56:07       that was a big thing for a while, right? Like local radio djs would be like huge stars locally.

Speaker 5:          02:56:13       He, yeah. His family is that. They're like, they're, well they're doing well. And then occasionally someone like Bob and Tom, they spread their empire out like all throughout a bunch of states. And I'm so happy that shows falling apart. Seems worse. People are they bad? I don't even know Bob. He wasn't there when I was there, but Tom, they're just talking about a bunch of people who are just disconnected and hate each other. Everybody in the studio hates each other. Really? They treated me like a fucking jerk off here. They treated me bad too. I wanted to go. I wanted to say shit. I wanted to kind of come out to them and say some stuff. But I felt bad because I know it's like for that club, that crackers club in Indianapolis, that's like her promotion man, that's the big deal to her. And I like her.

Speaker 5:          02:56:57       I like ruth and a lot. I didn't want to get her and a thing, you know, with them at all. But I mean that was biting my tongue for sure. I was like, why are you guys, the guy just asked what it was like the Harry Shearer on Wayne's world, you know, like, so uh, what do you. So you do you live in New York, Huh? And they just start doing something else and leans back to be like, uh Huh. Uh Huh. Uh Huh. Okay. I'm just looking at his computer is doing something else. Like we're looking to cds or something. I was like, and I pointed it out at one point and he's like, what are you talking about? Then this chick, the sports guys like seems like just disillusion. They're just angry at you for some reason for being in there at all and they all should on the girl. And then when it goes to commercial, like the blue angels man, they split off and formed and then the fucking chick sits in there and talks about how shitty everybody treats her and then they all come back in and just started over again. And they were mad at me because I said I didn't want to do bits will. That's what happened with me. I said I'll, I'll tell you things about myself, but I'm not doing bits.

Speaker 2:          02:57:59       Yeah man, it's, I guess they just get tired of it after awhile. I guess. So man, it's got the easiest fucking job ever. That's what I said four. It was with the, with the radio show, man. I'm like me and you know, even with the Legion of skanks, but all of them like, you know, they're all things you choose. Like I chose to do this thing with Dan soder on the, on comedy central. I chose to do legion of skanks with those guys. I wouldn't say we choose it, so it's like, yeah, it's like a thing. You look forward to doing it. It's not only that they had a super successful radio show that brought them a lot of money, but bob and Tom, when I was there were very nice. They were very nice to me and the people on there were very nice, but one of the producers met me in the fucking dressing room.

Speaker 2:          02:58:37       He came into me and he goes, okay, what are the subjects you're going to talk about and what questions do you want them to ask you? I went, what? And he's like, yeah, you have to have something prepared. Like you got shitty with me. I was like, dude, I don't give a fuck. Whatever you guys want to talk about, we'll talk about. I got. I'm like, you're talking to the wrong guy. Like marnee successful. Like I don't have to do this. Like I'm doing this for fun. Like I'm in town. I wanted to meet Bob and Tom on the show at the crackers places almost sold out already. This is all just for fun, like don't get shitty with me. Like it was in town for a UFC and uh, it was, it was weird. It was, it was like I realized what it's like to deal with these people that they like put the clamp on you like get out there and perform.

Speaker 2:          02:59:16       You got to get out there and dance. Like these are the subjects, but then you have great, like the precedent. Steve and Philadelphia. Oh yeah. Those guys are great because they're great. Yeah. They don't have the bus. You're the producer from palm and Tom. He walked out of the room. It didn't tick a box walked when I said I didn't have anything to turned around. Walked away like I was a piece of shit. I was like, you guys, this is like the worst way to set up like any sort of a fun interview. But when I got an Obama, Tom are great. Yeah, the other guy was great to the other guy that was with them or the Gal or whoever the fuck it was. Kitty, kitty layers. It was fun. They were fun. We just had a nice conversation. But no, uh, that's good.

Speaker 2:          02:59:51       I thought by that point I got there like Bob wasn't coming in anymore. Tom Seemed pissed. I was like, it was falling apart. Fucking guys don't get along after awhile too. That's part of the problem, you know? Sometimes like a fucking. Tom's getting all those gundam attention. It was the market Brian thing. Those guys seem to get along. Do they ever just fall apart? They just don't remember. They were La guys, Howard attack them too. Didn't hold a mock funeral for them. Yeah, and that John Debella and Philadelphia, that was a great one and I got to awful. He, ah, he won't let me on the show anymore because I said I won't give them bits. Same thing really. I'm like, why do you have an opportunity and don't want to just have a genuine fucking conversation with somebody. Why do you want to send me up? Like, what are you, Byron Allen, people want to hear shark attacks. What's the deal with that? Huh? And then he turns and starts reading car magazines, the mustache wax. And that's how it used to be though. Before the Internet, people used to go on these radio shows and they expected you to do standup bits and a lot of guys would just automatically start plugging their bits. I remember like one of the first times Marin was on opiod anthony. He was like doing

Speaker 5:          03:01:00       bits, like that's what people used to do. I remember listening to that going, Oh yeah, that's how people do it and go on these shows and they do bits. That's no fun. It's weird. By the way. I see the same exact thing I said to you in that you said to them in that room where I was like, just whatever they're talking about, we're talking about. They're talking about news. I was jumping into the news talk. We're talking about local sports was just, we'll figure it out man. Which just go, that's a worst way ever to here. Stand up to in like a fake Byron Allen style conversation. Yeah. We were just like, you know, for people in the room, laughing at it, sort of and knowing what's coming and they and they uh, like to, to really rub salt in the wound when I was on the show, every time they went or came back from a commercial, they would just play someone like doing a bit in studio.

Speaker 5:          03:01:49       It was like just road hack horseshit and then they would all, you'd hear them in the audio laughing from the time it was live and laughing now who can edit in the studio with the same kind of like, you know, just referenced. Just slapping the table and say, did this to fuck with you? You think? I don't know if that was to. Maybe it's what they do, but I mean like it's pretty awful when they're just playing people's. I mean real like, you know. Yeah. My kids don't listen to me, you know, they're all like a whatever, like the hook line and you know, whatever. Like the get her done is of that comic. Like they all say the. Were they good or does everyone in the room says it? Well, I think wrec radio is, it's like every, everything else, there's people that are really good at it.

Speaker 5:          03:02:35       Like Preston, Steve, they're actually fun to fund shell and then there's people that just, for whatever reason, that combination they put together as far as the team just was toxic. It didn't work. If you were at Stanford and sons in Kansas City that's not, no one wants you to do like seven radio shows and it's always like they want you to do bits and you're like, we have this argument every fucking time I come here, man. Go Talk. Yeah. Well, pressure to give to you. To have to do, I think, I think they realized they think it's gonna make you more comfortable. It makes me so uncomfortable with the concept of even trying to do that. I don't think that's what it is at all. I think they're lazy. I think they don't want to have to make something entertaining with you. They'd just rather you plug in and just start doing your bets.

Speaker 5:          03:03:16       Just give us content. I mean like you saying. So you're from New York, Huh? Yeah, I mean that kind of thing. That's like someone that's lazy, that's not someone who's trying to do the best possible show they can do and too jaded to realize they're being like mega rude to somebody just came in and you're like, hey fucker, it's five in the morning for me too. Well they know that no one can see them. Yeah. So because no one could see them, they can just totally disengage and let you just go ahead and dance monkey because that's, that's kind of interesting thing too about a podcast that was so many of them being video. Like you're also held accountable for paying attention. Oh fuck yeah, and you could see like weird faces that people make, you know, like if someone says something I was, I don't think he did it, you know, you could get away with a lot more.

Speaker 5:          03:04:01       There's a lot more things where it's like, Hey, that joke you guys made that black dude in the back didn't seem too impressed by that was I went home. Yeah. I don't know. I'm, I'm a big fan of podcasts. I just think it's the best art form ever for standup. It's a great thing that that's happened for staying in particularly in that. And those are the ones that rise. I mean there's obviously other ones too that rise to the top, but like to Howard's point, Howard Stern's point, it's like of course like every shithead 15 year old can just do it. But like the reality is it's gonna. It's gonna be like, you know, professional well done, like entertaining but, but you don't have to be famous and it can be like, look at those girls that make that podcast guys we fucked. They are always in the top 10.

Speaker 5:          03:04:44       Yup. They're always in the top 10 and no one knew who they were before that. I mean, or at least weren't. They weren't white. They were still like, like, uh, I mean like in the business and like lower level comics, just like their time in. They sold out the main room at the comedy store. I don't know what I'm saying. It's from their podcast. So it's pretty impressive. It's very impressive. The I, the idea that that would be for losers. That's crazy. I mean they've made it, like I said it, it jumped their level on, that's what I'm saying on their standup. They're just the years and stand up through the years and to sell out a room. Don't you think there was a guy like Howard, he's so famous, so rich and so successful. It's probably got to be like so hard to just hang with people so hard to just go somewhere and hang.

Speaker 5:          03:05:25       Well, he's just accepted like old, you know, whatever the quote unquote old Hollywood to him is now. So, you know, it's like, it's like Hampton's hangouts with like Jimmy Kimmel and Seinfeld. Do you know what I mean? Like, it's like that's his world now, which if you're going to have a group of buddies to fucking awesome group of buddies. Sure. No, no, without a doubt. I think as people he hangs out with his, like he does like, you know, uh, are a fun group, but he's gone that route. It used to be like, I'm with you people, you know, we're, we're fucking raging against the Johnny Carson's and the whatever else, you know. Yeah. And uh, or just like, you know, the upper echelons celebrities were. Now it's like, I mean, he interviews like that drives already lang, that's I think is because stern interviews people they actively worked to like shit on years ago.

Speaker 5:          03:06:13       Mm. You know what I mean? The Rosie O'Donnell's, the Kathy Lee Gifford, these people who it's like, he's like friendly with now because you know, well, he's changed to way more liberal and way more openminded and way more relaxed and way more politically correct. Sure. You did mature and there's no need for him to be extravagant to get attention or to be outrageous. No, he doesn't really have like, there's, there's rarely nudity on that show anymore and it used to be a lot of times like stripper involvement and, and when that Howard TV first kind of came out, the uncensored one, there was a lot of like filthy shit on the show and then it just kinda all went away. The bummer for me it was opie and Anthony. That was a bummer. That was a real bummer. But they split ways that really bothered me. Or did they find out physically didn't like each other for years before that?

Speaker 2:          03:06:57       Yeah. Yeah. But I thought they'd worked it out. I thought they had like a little riff but worked it out. But when the show went on without him, like I'm happy because I love Jimmy. Sure, you know, and love hanging with them, but it just always opie and Anthony and Jimmy, you know, it's like that. That trio was what were the magic was, you know, they had, they had a really good show and I had some fucking fun times on that show over the years when we did the baby bird was me for a rec. Fear and uh, who else? Well, an opiod, anthony and Jimmy and some dude threw up in some dude's mouth. They did a, a fucking eggnog eating contest and I'm pat from when he drank, he won. He wins every year when they're not only diabetes. So this guy had diabetes and he's drinking eggnog and I'm not just talking about drinking some Eggnog, drank quarts of Eggnog.

Speaker 2:          03:07:58       And then we were trying to figure out a way to make it more disgusting way threw up. And there's this kid named Pat Duffy who was an intern and he'll do anything. He ate dog shit. He brushed his teeth with dog shit. He's a, he, he ate throw up and cheerios and he said, how about if he leans his head over the garbage can and pat throws up in his mouth and he says, okay, I'm in. Who named it? The baby bird. I don't remember who named it the baby bird. I want to say it was red. It might've been. I might've been burned put. So there's Pat. Enormous man. Huge. Remember diabetes drinking sugar, sugary milk and drinking like a record number of it. So he's up to like, I dunno like 70 cops of this stuff and then he throws up, but no, not keep watching because it keeps going. The number, the amount of throw up is insane because it becomes cartoonish because it keeps coming. Look at that.

Speaker 5:          03:08:49       Hey guys never break and he's got his arms crossed. He's filming it on a flip phone and the right hand corner. We'll get it. Keeps going. Look, he just keeps going. Jesus. This is one of the funniest fucking videos I've ever seen in my life. It keeps going. It's insane. The sheer volume that this sheer volume look. I mean there's garbage bags all over the ground. Look at it again. It didn't make any sense. It's like the sheer volume was almost impossible. It seemed like it was photo shopped, but we were there seeing that live. I was going to say it has to be like a really. It was favorite ops and the memories always just going to be that I get. I didn't even have too much of a part in it.

Speaker 2:          03:09:41       Look at his face.

Speaker 5:          03:09:43       That's covered. Covered. It's insane. I didn't have a big part in it, but it's always kind of cool that it's such a memorable moment. Is the patrice laughing at Norton trying to talk a Bobo's bone or up and down and he does it and it was patrice. It's like a famous clip and patrice just cackling at this happening. It just happened to be there for the loan or up and down. He's got him excited. He would just, yeah, he would just talk sexual shit to him and, and he'd sit there with his pants down. He would get a boner and then no one will just start talking to him about something else and then it went up and down like two or three times. Jimmy's a national treasure really is, he's, he's an interesting guy because he's like one of the first, like really open freaks out in the public guy.

Speaker 5:          03:10:27       Like an open freak, you know, like someone will bring up a tranny, like wow, that must've been like, get excited. You know, like he'll, he'll start talking about sucking a guy's dank or you know, being with a tranny and it's just, he's so open about what he did. Was He shows though too, is that like if you own shit, even if it's like this, but even if you own it any way, if you go this is what I'm really into or if you just like Kinda go like the distance to be funny. Yeah. The world really does like forgive and forget that even forgives, not necessary. Always put like, and forgets right away. Like I've never fro the thing me and Lewis to, to promote skanks one time they were doing Kumi network was doing the, what do you call that kind of advertising for the other shows like just the bottom corner of the screen.

Speaker 5:          03:11:11       It'll be like, you know, you want to kind of make fun of that. So with all the podcasts we're doing like a little like thing that happened in the corner, bottom corner of the screen and we surprised dave because Dave's the most like, you know, homophobic the wrong word, but he's the most like least likely to joke around gay, like doing stuff at me and Louis just said like it'll wig Dave Ellis just make out when we were just taking like we're just taking a picture together, like a family photo and then me and you just start over him just start going at it hard and sure as shit man, we did it. We went for it. Tongues and everything. Yeah, it was gross. It was hardcore, it was gross. Neither of us enjoyed it but we just did it for the law. You know what I mean?

Speaker 5:          03:11:50       We got to laugh but I've never been like, no one's ever. There's never been any backlash for that in any way because we just kinda like, yeah. It's like, well how could you get back loss backlash is for people that are trying to hide that kind of behavior. It's not for people who are just open about it. When they get busted on is like pretend to be one thing like Jerry Falwell busted, but say there was no one that had like a like, I'm not going to be a fan of yours after that kind of shit. Like I guess a fan, you'd probably just never heard of them because there's so many. Yeah, I mean more people just kinda like. It's fucking hilarious. You'll lose one. You gain 10. Like it was a fuck. This is it right here. Yeah. We'll end with this.

Speaker 5:          03:12:35       But you guys keep going. Grab my tits. They got too weird. I, I grabbed your Dick. Alright, that's a wrap.
