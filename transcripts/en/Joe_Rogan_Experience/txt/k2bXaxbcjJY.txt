Speaker 1:          00:00          The joe rogan experience. Okay, let's not get crazy time. I've never been a big comedy short guy. Uh, I just recently, like this year, I've done like three sets there. And, uh, that, that's, uh, well, I, I've enjoyed going there and hanging out. Like I think the last time I saw you was there a, when I rented you a few years ago and you know, a good friends of mine play there. Um, but I always had a strange feeling about the place in which I'm starting to get over now, uh, because I've, I've enjoyed playing there this year. But, uh, I'm from, uh, the Orlando Florida area and when I was 19 years old, I won this contest, the funniest person in central Florida contest. Not Funny Person in Florida, funny person in central Florida, which I think is hilarious. Um, there was a kid in south Florida who was a real bad ass.

Speaker 1:          00:53          Um, and the Grand Prize of this contest was I got to go to fly to Los Angeles and do a set at the comedy store. And I'm 19 years old, man. I've been no comedy for two years. La. The college or Oh my God, you'd have thought I was doing Johnny Carson. This is my break, baby. Cool la man. And in retrospect, it was an open mic night and I only did five minutes, but there was a very famous comedian there. Uh, I won't mention the man's name. Uh, and he acted like I was the funniest comedian and ever seen in his life. And then he invites, he a big guy. I'm not saying it was a Pauly shore. No, no. Let's just for the record state who was not Pauly shore? Uh, no, let's go. Let's, let's, uh, leave some mystery. Um, anyway, so, so Amy not be a big guy.

Speaker 1:          01:43          He invites me to hang out with him and then he asked me to take a drive with him and Oh my God, you know, wouldn't want to take a drive with famous guy. And, uh, we'd car car. We parked in front of, uh, the rage on Santa Monica for like 20 minutes, and he said he's gay bar. Well, years later when I lived in La, I find out the rage is like the biggest gay bar in Los Angeles. I had no idea at the time. So this guy is showing off his young meat and uh, and then he says he needs to go by his apartment in Beverly Hills. And uh, we go in and the, on his wall, he had all these photos of him and famous people that were signed in. And so we go from one side down all the way and he's showing me, you know, this is me with Gandhi and Martin Luther King and whatever, whoever, and a, and then we get to the end of the wall and it's the corner.

Speaker 1:          02:37          This was the guys move to show you the pictures. You start at one side and then boom, you're in the corner. And He makes this move on me. And I'm 19 years old and the guy steps in on me and I just like, I just like Kinda of I the n and the guy steps in on me. Any, he cupped my ass. Oh, with each hand he's got it. And it has to, why you're afraid to say this man's name? I don't say it. Don't, don't, I won't say I won't. I promise you, I won't say it, but I will say what it rhymes with. No, no, no, no, no, no. Don't, don't, don't, don't, don't do it. Please don't. Well, I'm so anyway, uh, you know, I said, can we go back to the comedy store and, um, I can't help but reflect on that moment all these years later and think how much further my career would have gone if I would've just fucked it up. I don't think so. You would lose all your street credit, kidding Louis. Anyway, but that was why. So like, you know, and I go back to Florida, I'm 19 and like, people are like, hey, how was your trip to Hollywood? I don't want to talk about it. And, uh, have you talked to him since [inaudible] seven and never seen the guy ever again. But, um, uh, but yeah, so that kind of made me chai away from the comedies.

Speaker 2:          03:51          Sure.

Speaker 1:          04:20          You ready to, of course recording. Oh, it is already. What the fuck's on?
