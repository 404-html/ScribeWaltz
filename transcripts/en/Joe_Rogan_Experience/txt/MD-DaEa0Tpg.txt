Speaker 1:          00:00:00       Five four, three, two, one, boom. And we're live. Mr Bisbing, how are you sir? What's up Joe? I'm good. Finally did this, man, I know if it sounds good about it for years. Feels like a lifetime. It's been quite a while, man. Yeah, yeah. But yeah, happy to be here. Quite the setup you have as an Englishman. Please explain to me the Hawaiian flag. What the fuck is the Hawaiian vibe? I'm like confused. I was looking at it the other day when Max Holloway one. I was like, if I didn't, if you didn't know any better and you looked at that, you'd like, this isn't some strange flag by off the bar. I'm like, girls are smart guy. I've seen the podcast. He goes deep and I'm like, do I need to reach some encyclopedias before I come on here? And the first thing you say is explain the British flag.

Speaker 1:          00:00:45       Sorry, the Hawaiian flag. What is that? Well, it's like claim to be an expert on the history of Hawaii. I failed that class, funnily enough. But I would say that we kind of organized it at one point much like America. I don't know if you know this much, like, you know you're going to Australia, India, Australia has got a funky flavor. We like to insert the Union Jack in, in lots of things. And you think about the size of England, how much of the world you guys kicked ass on? It's pretty God damn impressive. It really is. But again, I'm no historian. No, but yeah, but no, it is. I'm a proud Englishman. I guess our ancestors were not my ancestors. My ancestors are Polish and Irish. But uh, but yeah, the British, they did okay. Did a lot of shit, got a lot done or they did.

Speaker 1:          00:01:33       They did. You know, I was at a, they get a lot of terrible things, I'm sure over the years. But yeah, I remember once I was in there in Canada at a, at a party of all things, about three o'clock in the morning as well, you know, as one does. And I walk in and some guy starts going crazy at me. The things that the British have done over the years, you should be ashamed of yourself. And he was causing a huge scene, really screaming at me. Right. And I mean going crazy. And I'm like, dude, what the fuck? Nothing to do with me is that you should be ashamed. So in the end, I said, well, where's your family from? And you're not gonna believe this is, he said Mongolian Germany. I'm like, fuck you. You're a German, you're German and you're giving me shit about my heritage.

Speaker 1:          00:02:14       Okay. But I suggest you shut the fuck up. That's pretty hilarious about the history. The Germans way more reason. Oh yeah. Just a little bit. Just a little bit of English stuff isn't the past. Come on. It's like with swords and arrows and Shag Robinhood towns. Come on, come on. You know? Do you like living over here? Yeah, very much so. You know what I mean? Of course. You know, you miss, you miss home, you miss friends and family. Certainly. Um, you know, as you get older and your parents get older, you know, you, you do think about those things. But yeah, it's great. It's great place to live. You got to, your accent has teamed it's Oh a bit. Well, when you go back home to they give you shit about it. I get shit all the time. Yeah. All the time. And then like, what's this weird accent, Mike? Um, and he's like

Speaker 2:          00:03:00       this, I'm intelligent enough to adapt to the surroundings that I'm in. You know, a, I'll now say tomatoes instead of tomato because I don't want a cute little back and forth to five minutes with the fucking waitress. Do you know what I mean? I just want to order my breakfast. He called bomb with, oh my God, you're English. You know what I mean? So I'll say tomorrow I'll say coffee, but when I go back home, it kind of, you know, and then working on Fox, um, they did, they worked on me for a while until that Mike, we like what we think. We like what you're saying. The problem is we, I understand what you're saying. It seems like it's good stuff. There's lots of energy there, but, uh, you to slow down while for pronounce your words. So, uh, so yeah, it is a little bastardized.

Speaker 3:          00:03:43       Have you thought about doing commentary on UFC cards? Have you done any of those yet?

Speaker 2:          00:03:48       I've just done the, what is it? The content is here is that's it. Yeah, that's it. But, but, but I think it's, well, I know it well. It should be coming. Ups just negotiated a deal for a child with Zach, so yeah. That's good to hear. Yeah, yeah, yeah. You know, cause you're really excellent as an analyst. Well thank you very much. I appreciate it.

Speaker 3:          00:04:06       Joy, your insight when you're on the panel, that panel is great. That that is one of the best things UFC has done is do that post fight show because when the fights are over, you sitting around going, Fuck Holy Shit. And then to have you guys break it down and then break it down beforehand as well, but break it down afterwards. I really do enjoy that.

Speaker 2:          00:04:22       Well thank you very much. He had the guys do a good job. Um, yeah, it's fun, you know, I mean it's, it's nice to be involved with the sport obviously as a martial artist, as a fighter and then now retired. He's still, you know, still have a little hand in there and it's, it's, it's nice. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:04:37       Made a smooth transition from being a fighter to, to retired seems at least from the outside looking in that it seems fairly smooth. It's like some guys have a rocky road. It's hard for them.

Speaker 2:          00:04:48       Well it's because, um, you know, I mean, I, I want to tell the truth while I'm on here, so, so I will tell the truth, but, you know, I had eye injuries, you know, so, you know, every form from when the eye injuries happened in 2013, I always felt like I was on borrowed time. So I was conscious of trying to set myself up outside of the octagon where a lot of fires don't have that luxury. You know, I'm thinking he could end at any mom. And so I was actively pursuing a life outside of the octagon, a career outside the octagon. So then when that day came, I was good. You know, excuse me. Some carbonated energy during that shall remain nameless, but, uh, but yeah, so, uh, so yeah, no, I, I was working on that for a while and yeah, you know, things are going well.

Speaker 2:          00:05:38       You know, there's quite a lot of things going on. So when you do that podcast with Louis Gomez, got the podcast, believe you me, I've got a company called play lime. It's a a, it's a gambling. It's fancy sports, but it's fancy sports simplified. Basically. It's kind of like a sports lottery. So if we were focusing on the UFC, who's going to win? What round? How many take downs? We do five stars. He hid them buying and you've got $1 billion. We had the analytics groups at Harvard and Yale come up with a s a league. So the top 50 people split away everything. You've got a billion and $1 billion. One Ba ba boom, billion dollars, baby. I'm gonna give away $1 million every single day of play. land.com boom. There it is. It is available in our first year. It's blowing up. It's blowing up big town. We're just about to sign a deal with a couple of major sports franchises to be their official game.

Speaker 2:          00:06:27       So, uh, so that's going really well. Um, so it's a essentially like a fantasy, a martial arts thing. Like you just know it. It's NASCAR, football, MMA. The beauty of play land is you can set a play land to anything and like we could set a play land how many times he's Bisping gonna burb how many times you're going to get up and have a pice of many tangents. Rock are going to roll his eyes at Mike. Do you know what I mean? You can set it for anything. So he's very applicable. Uh, how many times, how many likes is Kim Kardashian going to get in a next past? You know what I mean? So it's um, yeah, we're getting a lot of traction. It's doing really, really well. Very proud of it. I would think

Speaker 3:          00:07:02       if it's $1 billion, I would think it'd be like some Guy Ritchie movie where the sum mobsters would get together with some fighters.

Speaker 2:          00:07:09       Yeah. This is how we're going to do it. See, try and fix it down three times. Yeah, I've never heard it. An English gangs to sound loud. The from like 1920 Chicago she shoes. This is what we're going to do. We'll see. But yeah, I guess no is that hasn't nobody's cheated yet. But you know the reason why I say this totally undermining the system, Joe, really appreciate it. The reason why I say this is because this happened

Speaker 3:          00:07:32       then with professional pool, professional pool had a line at one point in time in Vegas casinos and the pool players all got together and said, listen, what's fucking put all our money on this guy who was at the 10 to one favorite to win it or tend to one underdog to win it and we'll make money. And so they all dumped in this one guy, I think his name's Mike Lebron. He won the whole thing.

Speaker 2:          00:07:50       The only way he could do that as if there was no stats now stats. So if it was game of basketball, everyone would just have to stand there and do nothing. Right. Which I would assume. I mean, I don't know too much about basketball, but I was, I was Shem athletic commissions referees. People getting, somebody would say something if everyone was just standing there doing nothing. Well they did with pool. They can gamble on porn anymore. Oh really? Cool players are too shady. Yeah, they do. They are. They are shady. The shady guys. Anyone that plays pool in England, it's because they spend so much time in pubs. Exactly. He spent so much time in pubs. Yeah. Hanging out with some interesting characters, you know, unsavory characters. Dude, you, you started at UFC ultimate fighter season two. How crazy. Three season three what? What season to the end now or some shit. Like what? What are they on? I think they just did 28 28 but that's crazy. But that's all in the US. They have to the Brazilian one, they have the Australian Diego Sanchez and still fucking going at it. That's what's insane. That's impressive. Season One. He's a, he's a, God bless

Speaker 1:          00:08:56       him. You know, good for him. Good for him. And he fucking one reasonably, which is impressive. No, I know. Any fights in a way that isn't conducive to a long career? No, but he's had one my word. It's incredible. It really is. He really, is he warrior such a fucking character too. Oh Dude. He's out of his mind in a good way. I mean, you know, I mean that's a compliment I do as well. Yeah. Yeah. No, he's a maniac. But uh, I mean Darcar season one and still still going strong. I know, I know. Crazy. Crazy. It's been a long ride for myself as well, but uh, enjoyed it and enjoyed every minute of it. It was great. Nice to, nice to leave everyone the title though, right? Oh, 100%. How Nice is that? The cap it off because you had such a long career man.

Speaker 1:          00:09:34       I mean, you fought the best of the best and for you to cap it off, knocking out Luke Rockhold and then having that, oh, no one could take that away from you for now. For sure. You know what I mean? I was talking about this recently. I'm filming a documentary called built for this and it's about my career. And they were asking about that, you know, how would you feel? Excuse me. This carbonating Eddie's drink shall remain nameless energy drink and a cock creature or something like that. Creature Demon. Something lie. That mythological, scary, scary, scary monster. There you go. Um, no, no. They were asking about my fight career. How would I have felt had I not won the belt? And you know, I mean, it would have felt like it was unfinished business. I wouldn't have been quiet as content is walking away. When I did had a, had I not won the belt, other than winning the belt Wa and winning the ultimate fighter, I'm sure.

Speaker 1:          00:10:30       But what was your most satisfying victory? Was it Conley? No, no, no. I don't know. I'm the most satisfying victory. My word. Oh, Anderson Silva. Anderson Silva. Yeah. That was a big one for me. Yeah, that was a big one too, because of the cheap knee. It was cheap. It was, she said that it was cheap. I mean, I'm a giant Anderson Silva Fan. Yeah, everybody is. You don't get any bigger interest in a feeling than me, but you didn't have your mouthpiece. You were pointing to the mouth piece, you were separated and you took a pause and he thought the referee was going to separate you and give you back your mouthpiece. And Anderson comes in with the knee. Well, I know the rules. There has to be a lull in the action for the referee to step in, you know, and I'm backing up and we're not engaged in blows.

Speaker 1:          00:11:11       To me, that's a little in the action. So I take that moment to point down over here and say my mouthpiece, and as I'm down there, boom, he throws a beautiful knee. It was beautiful. It really was good for him. You know, I don't hold it against the guy. It is what, it fucking came back, eh. It wasn't fucking easy. I'll tell you that. Every part of my will to our continue. But yeah, you came back and won the next round. That was what spectacularly impressive. What, that's what you said. What is the most satisfying? When I had said that was one of them. Of course, you know, beating Rockhold and winning the belt. Nothing tops that. But the big one too because you came in on short notice as well. Sure, sure. But the uh, yeah, the answer one because of that, you know, it just made the storyline so much better, you know, to, to fight through that adversity to, um, you know, I have to dig deep after winning it on, you know, I won the first drop Tim drops when the second round, third round I was winning then that happened.

Speaker 1:          00:12:11       So yeah, no, it felt good. It felt good. Yeah. That was, uh, I mean that also like to, just to get a victory over that guy when it all said and done. There's a, there's some, yeah. Listen, I'm aware of that. People would say, oh, but you didn't get Anderson in his prime. Well, maybe it was at his prime, but with the amount of shit that I talked, I certainly see a devil's in the way for me to, the waste for recently. You know, and it's funny because people always say you don't worry that when you talk shit gone into a fight that you got to motivate your opponent even more. And I always used to say, oh no, don't be stupid. Listen, they're gonna try and hit you as hard as they can, but I don't know. And that one, I think it did motivate Anderson cause he was certainly not fucking about it and that one, that's for sure.

Speaker 1:          00:12:57       No you wasn't, it wasn't like the Anderson in the Derek Brunson fight, that's for sure. Yeah. That was a different fight right there in Brunson and him almost like looked him in an agreement. They didn't fight. Yeah. It was a weird fight. Yeah. It's like we're, Bronson didn't want to risk anything, didn't want to engage with them too, too quickly or go too hard. But then you see some of his fights, he comes at you like a fucking Marauder who? Derek Pronto. Oh yeah, no, absolutely. Um, I was talking about this recently with the Israel ladder Sanya fight and I think a kind of pissed Israel off with a couple of my comments. And that wasn't my intention. I said, excuse me. I said, I'm not, I don't know if I'm completely sold on Israel yet. And what I meant by that, I didn't mean sold on him being a great fire because he's clearly a great face.

Speaker 1:          00:13:44       Clearly world class. What I meant was sold on him being the future of the division and being the champion. That's what I meant, because Brunson never showed up in that fight. Right. And I mean, they were the greatest of respect. He was like a deer in the headlights, you know, who he was intimidated. It just been knocked out of Jack Era. You know, I was a little gun shy, you know, and it was a great performance. Israel did what he needed to do. But as I say, you know, it takes two to tango and there was only Israel really fat. And in that fact, so when I said those comments, I said, ah, I'm not entirely sold on that fight. That's what I meant. I didn't mean because I don't think he's well class or excellent fire cause he clearly is. I just meant not sold on that fight.

Speaker 1:          00:14:23       Whether or not he's the future of the division. Well it's a stacked fucking division. I mean, look, you mean you still have your well Romero at the top of the heap. I don't know what they're doing with him. I mean he was supposed to be fighting. Uh, um, boy cina would, oh yeah, pal. Acosta. Acosta, but her chine. Yeah. Who's a fucking monster. If anybody who's not on steroids who looks like they're on steroids, it's him and girl in the mirror. Wow. It's not that easy these days with the siren. But come on. Some of them are on steroids. Some of them probably are Joe, but who's on? Okay. You're telling me that you don't believe that Yoel Romero ever took a steroid in his life? I didn't say that. Okay. I definitely didn't kill. I think it's possible. It's totally possible. How's that fence you're sitting on that I get hit?

Speaker 1:          00:15:13       It's a tough scenario for you to be it. No, no, no. See commentary can honest Bro, I believe that I'll say it and let's not forget he tested positive. There was that whole, anytime somebody says it was a taint or supplement is bullshit. You never test the part as a friend. Never tested positive in my life. Let me tell you something. I'm not a guy that scours the back of everything I've read. I'm a careless motherfucker. I really am. I wish I wasn't, but I am. I'll just go through my life doing what I do. I've been tested a million times. Never come close. Okay. Some of the guys, they blow up the lab, you know, there's no smoke without fire. You know what I'm saying? I agree with you. I agree with you. I remembered there was talk years back, um, before you saw that there was talk of certain camps that would hire guys who knew testing and these guys would orchestrate a program for these fighters to make sure that they didn't get caught right.

Speaker 1:          00:16:06       They would figure out ways to, you know, to taper off but still keep your gains and, and make sure that you didn't test positive at all. And this was done under the assumption that everyone else was cheating as well. And this was for a long time. That was how a lot of people viewed the sport. There was guys like you, Bj Penn, there was a few guys that you just knew weren't going to do anything. There was their word. They said they were never going to do anything and, and they never looked like they did anything. You always maintain the exact same physique throughout your entire career. What the thing is, I think where they started getting a little weird, and I don't want to bang on about stowaways too much because that's been a narrative that I've over. Yeah. You know, I've said my piece about that.

Speaker 1:          00:16:50       Right. I don't want to, you know, banging on about it too much, but I think where the water's really got America is when TRT came in, testosterone replacement therapy became a thing. I know you had to do was go to the doctor and said, hey, you know, I can't get a hard on or whatever and all of a sudden they sign you off or u of t it. No, I know even worse, you could take steroids first and then come off of it. So your testosterone was low. They'll really go to a doctor and say, I have low testosterone of course. Yeah. Because it messes up your natural production of it. Took steroids and then went in afterwards and said they have low testosterone because they were on steroids short. Not Exactly. So then it became legal and then you had all these guys coming out of there saying, you know, if I'm the on TRT I'll die, I'll die. And then the outlawed it and then 10 years later some of them are still fighting to this day. Yes. You know. So without naming names, you know who you are. Shame on you. You talked about TRT Belcourt to your TV tour. Belfort forever. I mean that was when

Speaker 2:          00:17:50       he was on TRT. He was a different kind of human being. He was just completely different than he is in either circumstance. Oh yeah. Looking back you can say that. I mean cause when I follow him, I fought him on tit. You find him when he was at the Super Victoria absolutely. Look like fucking the incredible hulk. He had butt muscles on his fucking eyebrows. Yeah. Looking back, you can see that, you know, but, but at the time, as a fighter, you gotta be, you can't think like that. You know what I mean? What are you looking at? Oh yeah. That doesn't do it justice. That's supposed to be before and after.

Speaker 2:          00:18:26       I'm just recovering from a cold or the week. I'm a little congested, so keep coughing. The real, the real key. That's a better one. That's better. That's way better. That's much more accurate. And he's a guy who was known to take things. I mean, he took things early in his career. Remember when he fought Randy when he was 19? He was 240 pounds. Yeah, exactly. His neck start at the top of his head. Yeah. But Sam, yeah, I remember there was a picture of us both on the scale in Brazil and, uh, you know, looking back now a holy shit, you know, anyone else would, they have seen these guys kind of big blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. But you're not think like that at the time. You can't, as a fighter, if you start having those thoughts, those doubts shut looking at fighters physique and thinking, oh, he looks good.

Speaker 2:          00:19:10       You've already lost. You know. But in hindsight, you can look back at your holy fuck, what was I thinking? You know, this guy's fucking birdied out of his mind. I remember on the, I was trying to get a rise out of him and he kept putting his hand in my face. I'm not a religious guy and, and you know, God bless anyone that is, you know, I, I mean that, I respect everyone's opinions, but I'm not. And as we now veto is heavily religious and he kept sticking in his thing in my face. He was pissing me off. So I said, Peter, come here, come here. And he leans down. I said, Dooley's no, Jesus, mate. Maybe there is, maybe there is, you know, me getting their jobs with a head kick in the second round. Maybe that was God thwarting May, who knows? What did he say? Some fucking Portuguese bullshit. I don't know.

Speaker 2:          00:19:58       There's, there is the fine line though, between target shit and uh, and backing it up. But you don't, you, you, you did a great job of pissing people off in your career. And that is, that plays a factor that whatever you can do to get just them a little bit out of their comfort zone, a little bit out of their composure. I, and you, you were really good at that. Yeah. You're not, you know, I mean, I hate that to be, uh, you know, the first thing that people say about me, but you know, what's one, it wasn't a, it was a thing, you know, it was what I did. And in my mind, you know, where I come from, my background, you know, if we're going to fight, then we're going to fight and then it's all out war, you know? And until it's all said and done.

Speaker 2:          00:20:39       And if I can make you doubt yourself, if I can, you know, it's like at the wains at the ways, that's the last time you're going to get a chance to stand in front of your opponent and send a message to him. You know what I mean? And if you get in his face and you can just instill a little fear, puffy chest, that's why animals do it in the wild. You know what I mean? Puffy chest out, look intimidating, look as angry as you can, you know? And, and some fires might just look at that and laugh and said, this ain't going to work on me, but some it does. And, and then, and then they don't fight to the best of their ability because they're slightly doubting themselves and they're not fully committed to the punch or the kick. And if they're not fully committed, they're not 100%.

Speaker 2:          00:21:16       They're not fighting as well as they can be. And I'm winning that battle, you know? So yeah, you look like kind of a thug standing up there and pointing your finger and talking shit. But it's for a reason, you know, it works. Yeah. And those Mcgregor Mcgregor is the best at it, you know. Yeah. It gets people to fold. Look at Dustin Poirier. Yay. Didn't even show up in that first fight. It's true. Yeah. He, yeah, he, I mean, don't get me wrong. He was great as well. You know, it wasn't just the trash dot. No, he's great as well. I think the Nate Diaz fight didn't, it didn't work in that fight. Nate doesn't give a fuck. Doesn't give a fuck. There you go. It doesn't work. Exactly. It doesn't work. We touch shit at him and he's like, fuck you. It doesn't, yeah. It doesn't make him feel bad at all.

Speaker 2:          00:21:56       He, it didn't exactly feel comforting. Yeah. Well, you know, just another day at the office, you know, it's a, it's a thing like a lot of people would wish that fighters were respectful and just, you know, treat it well, the martial arts way and bow to each other. And that's great. It is. You know, it's funny, I was working out this morning and the gym manager, uh, he said, he said, you know, actually I feel that that side of things can have, you know, it's killing the UFC and I shut the fuck up. I'm like, you know, I nodded away and like, you know, respectful to the guy. Um, but I, I see his point, I understand what he's saying, but it's entertainment and it gets people that, that's another reason why I used to do it. You're trying to sell the fight. You know, you want, you want, you want every product you're involved with to be as popular as possible.

Speaker 2:          00:22:44       Whether it's a podcast, whether it's fighting, whether it's whatever it is. If no one's watching, no one gives a fuck, then you're not going to make much money. You're not going to get booked again. You're not going to be on the big cards. So you talk a little, I know from a consumer standpoint, if I'm watching a fight, I mean, look at that last week with their fury and wilder, you know, I was, I was eating at the palm of their hands. It was an amazing fight. But um, you know, it hypes it. It's great. It's awesome to watch. I mean, yes, it is beautiful to see two fires walk up there and bow and shake hands and all the rest of it. But it's also a little fucking boring if I'm honest lot when I'm working the ways yards, I'm like give me something to talk about please.

Speaker 2:          00:23:19       You know, cause I don't want to talk about your boy and last bite, they went to a split decision and we're, nothing really happened. But if you get in their face at the way him, great. We can pump it up a little bit. We can sell the fight. We can hype it up. Yeah. When they have these press conferences and no one's being mean at all. I mean, half the funds shit. Yeah, no, absolutely. Do you know, I'm enjoying myself. I'm in my element of there. It's like, you know, the famous one with GSP when his IRA, you intoxicate dead. Well, yeah. Well Yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:23:46       I'm in Vegas. Where do you want me to do? You know, you don't want to fight until the end of the year and it's January. Okay. If we were fighting in two months, I wouldn't be in toxic gay did for right now. I am. You know, so, yeah. Well, there's been some hilarious moments in press conferences. I mean, the, the one that giant one with the UFC were, uh, Jeremy Stephens out the Connor fuck is that, that was hilarious. That was great. It really was good. It honestly, every time I see that, I do laugh. It was great. He had to say was, is that guy? But I don't know. But I think he was actually actually serious. Is this guy calling me out talking shit? Or he knows who Jeremy Stevens. Just know. You don't think so? Maybe. Maybe, maybe. Maybe not. Maybe not. I don't know everybody up there sometimes at press conferences.

Speaker 1:          00:24:38       Yeah. You can't. You know what I mean? Do you have see has more than 500 fighters on their roster. Exactly. Especially when they have those giant press conferences and there's, yeah. Need levels of design. 16 fires up there. It's impossible. I like both. I like when fighters are respectful and I like when fighters talk shit. Yeah, for sure. I mean, I did enjoy, it was nice to see. Yeah. Brian Ortega. Max Holloway. They had that nice back and forth where Max, sorry. Pardon me. Brian was, you know, he's like, listen, I hope you're well and a hobby or over the injuries and all that type of thing. That was nice to seems great, but they both were exuding confidence at the same time. They were both adamant they were going to win the fight. So it wasn't the, they weren't being too overly cordio. Yes. You know, I don't want to see that.

Speaker 1:          00:25:20       Right, right. I don't want to, I don't want to see too fast pretending like they were in church or meeting the fucking president. Okay. I want to see two guys that want to rip each other's heads off. Call me an animal, call me a bad parent. Call me whatever you want. But that's what gets my engine taken. Well, even when they were at the final weigh in and they're staring each other down, like even though it was respectful, there was a lot of tension. There's a lot of tension. You, you know, you're talking about as a way in. Yeah. I never saw that one when they were at the way in Maxim Brown, they just stood, you know, a couple of feet away from each other staring at each other and it was intense. It was real. There was a fucking hell of a fight to ballsy shit. He's incredible.

Speaker 1:          00:26:01       He really is. Really is. I mean, I was kind of um, not concerned and of course were the one who initially throw up the red flag when you saw, you just felt like he looked too tired or lazy. Slurring his words. He looked, he looked half asleep. He looked like he just got out of bed. That's how we looked. And then he was slurring his words. And then, so I just said, your care Max, everything good. And he's just like, know. Yeah, he was slowing it. Simple as that. And I'm like, and of course UFC tonight you have a production meeting, we go over the questions, we're gonna ask. So you've got them questions there in front of you. And I thought, I can't stick to these questions. I've got to ask this guy. Are you okay? You know, for you. I'm glad you did that.

Speaker 1:          00:26:41       Well, you know, I felt bad afterwards because then I heard that the fire was off. And then I thought, shit, if I'd gone on, you know, two days, three days out from a five I got on fucking UFC tonight, or whatever, you're doing my obligations as a fire. And then another fire on the roster is calling me out for an injury. And now the fight itself, I'd have been pissed off with them. You know what I mean? Maybe you know that that's my choice if I want to highlight it. So I felt a little bad, but I really respect him. Max, he sent me a message thanking me, you know, he said, thank you. He said, you know, he said, uh, I appreciate that I needed someone to do that because he knew he was, he wasn't 100%. Um, so yeah, so anyway, I will say that I wasn't fully convinced that he was okay.

Speaker 1:          00:27:22       Cause it seemed like he was not an os still slow in his words or whatever, but a mumbler he's a mumbler. Yeah. So am I, you know, so, uh, he's, uh, he was fine though. He was more than fine, dude. He looked insane. Insane. Ortega fired back or three shots third round, hit him a couple of big shots and then at the end of the third round he's like, this is my right. No, I saw him and I told you. Yeah, it's crazy. It's crazy. And Cardio Cardio is incredible to the roof, you know. Excellent. Footwork combinations could Sangha as well. Weeds the fight. That's the main thing. You know what I mean? He reads the fight, so yeah, he reads the fine and he's, he's, he's so good at implementing that strategy of like consistent pressure, constant angles, switching stances. And he switched his stamps as flawlessly fights.

Speaker 1:          00:28:11       Just as good south paws. It does Orthodox and he'll switch in the middle of a combination and then turn corners on. Absolutely. That's right. He's not there to be counted. Yeah. Not An amazing man. Really good. And when you hit him back you look claps. Yeah, no for sure. It gets recorded. Alarmists and he just pointed at the floor. He's like, come on, let's go right here. That's that. And then bang it out. Yeah. He's a wise all soccer. That was awesome. Really was, you know, it's, it's great to see that he is okay too. But I'm really happy that you did point that out because there was some issues and I think a lot of that probably had to do, I'm just speculating, but probably had to do with that massive weight cut. I mean he was trying to get down really quickly to one 55 which is crazy.

Speaker 1:          00:28:50       Right. Cause he fights at one 45 is the champion. And even struggling to go down from him that he was in the one eighties get down to one 55 quickly to find that it can be. Yeah, because they offered it to him on last minute. Sure. You know when Tony tore his knee apart, was that on set with you guys? Well, you wasn't there. I wasn't there now, but yeah, it was in studios. Yeah. What a fucking freak occurrence. That was crazy. Trips over some wires blows his knee apart. What was it? The fire had been matched three times. Yeah. And then they're all most of that. That the finish line doing the final bit of press. Yeah. It's crazy. It's insane. You can such bad luck. It's like those guys are destined to never fight. Oh, they've got to fight now. I would if I was the, if I could wave a wand in any match I want not division.

Speaker 1:          00:29:35       That's the one that's the match. Oh, for sure. Well, it's the fight that has to happen. You know what I mean? Tony is, uh, in my, my still the interim champion. Knowing your why, the Triptan, it doesn't make any sense to me. Listen, Tony's, you know, he's a, he's a, he's a character, shall we say. Yeah. He's a character. He's a unique character, but he, in my mind, he fought for the interim title. He won the interim title and then he fucking blew his knee out, you know, doing press obligations. It didn't do anything stupid. No, exactly. That's why I didn't understand that they stripped him and I was like, this guy, I mean the guy's ready to fight then and then a few months later he was ready to go again. He beats the shit out of Pedis. Yeah, no noise. And he looked incredible jobs kind of concerned in that fight as well because it was so fast coming knock and I've so fast and apparently he was doing his own rehab, these wild techniques and you saw that stuff online that he was doing.

Speaker 1:          00:30:29       I thought this guy is going to hurt himself again. But uh, now he went out there, looked amazing. You didn't even do any sparring. Oh really? Yeah. Interesting. I need to find this out for sure for him. But the word I'm getting for people that know him and said he didn't spar, he just got an incredible shape and he said, look, this knee is healing up. It's in the process of healing. And during his camp it was continuing to heal and they chased him the way he kept that going. I don't do any take downs. Don't get your knee wrench, don't get leg kicked. Well spine is the hardest part of preparing for a fire. Of course, you know. Well and the wrestling, wrestling, inspiring. They're, they're the toughest probably wrestling grantees actually. But find a wrestler doesn't have fucked up knees. Yeah, my knees are fuck.

Speaker 1:          00:31:09       Not that I'm arrested far from it, but my knees are just destroyed. The stress gets mostly, well I think I have a torn meniscus on my good knee right now cause that's not good knee. But my bad knee, um, I actually GSP the son of a bitch, he caused it back here. I was training for the ultimate fighter three final and it was trending with George and we were training, you know, zoo for the old Jew for headquarters. They've done little gym at the bottom with the boxing ring. Yeah. We were wrestling in there and then my knee hit the floor, tore my PCL, and then just one thing after the other, you know, that was what, 1312 years ago. And it's just always been kind of fucked. Yeah. Well actually in here right now, when we finished out, when I stand a limp like crazy, because when I sit here like this, it just seizes up like crazy.

Speaker 1:          00:31:54       So if I'm in a restaurant, let's stand up. And I walked like a moron. If I wanted the bathroom, it was like fucking look at this guy, Jesus grass. But then I walked back and I'm walking in, find the light, this attention seeking bastard. Forgot that he put on a fake Linwood. He went to the bathroom. I'm like, no, it's unseized now. It's okay. It's just when I first stand up. Yeah. Uh, the popliteal cyst. I think that's what causing that right now. So there's a system there? I think so. Yeah. Well, no, it's rained. Yeah, no, I know this on my right knee. I've had them drink twice. Yeah, I've got to get that done. It's a pain in the ass. Yeah, it is. The last time they just went in there and just pulverized it went in there and just kept sticking it with needles.

Speaker 1:          00:32:32       Rarely. Yeah. Yeah. I've got to get it done. I've got to get that. I got to get a lot of shit. Does my neck issue, remember we talking years ago in Manchester about [inaudible] and people didn't know, but what I mean it was hard for me to talk about it any more to talk about too much while I was commentating. Your fights, you had a neck injury that was so bad. One of your arms was weaker than the other, like if you were doing bench press. Oh for sure. Still to this day. I mean you could, you could take that Samurai sword. I don't advise it and stick it through the skin there and I wouldn't feel a thing. Well, I don't know if I wouldn't feel a thing, but I'm totally numb. Totally in a Maya. I had a shower after my workout before and now what a gala I get lied to.

Speaker 1:          00:33:11       It's like a a singer. Yeah. But Dan, the entire buying side, it was in the shower. I was there. It's having, the few times when I've been working on TV, I was doing this show called hyper drive for Netflix in the summer and we will, we will, we will, it was night shoots is that four in the morning and all of a sudden I'm doing this and everyone's like, oh my God. Oh. I'm like, it's okay. Calm down. They're like medic. I'm like, no, it's okay. It happens all the time. So yeah, it's just pinched nerve, you know, c five c six, I gotta get it taken care of. Um, have you ever done any decompression or anything like that? Um, it's all my own fault. You know, I'm too old school. I need to go in and have treatment on my body, but it's like, it's a whole thing.

Speaker 1:          00:33:54       Joe Casey, I'm a busy man. I haven't got an afternoon to golf sit and you know, get Masyado decompressed or I need to do it. I need to do it. And this year, 2019 is a year that I get all these little, because my quality of life is still fine. You know what I mean? I just, I just grin and bear it and whatever and just occasionally have a mini heart attack, you know, I'll be okay, I'm fine. But eventually, this is the year I'm gonna get all these little niggles taken care of. Well there's a company in Santa Monica called lifespan medicine and they do a procedure called Regena keen and that's what Peyton manning had done over in Germany. Come. Brian had it done. And this is how I fixed my bulging disc in my neck. Well, when I saw you there in Manchester, Dana tried to send me to Germany. Yes. And I was telling you, you don't have to go to Germany. Yeah, yeah, they do. It's exactly the same procedure. I didn't go to Germany, go to Durham, that couldn't be bothered.

Speaker 1:          00:34:49       I didn't want to go down and spend a half an hour or half of my day. I don't want to fly to fucking Germany and giving you a week or whatever. So not that much time. It'll take you like a couple hours. You do it three or four times and they can fix it. Now I know inflammation. The other thing is there's a thing that they sell at Amazon. You just get on an amazon.com or a bunch of other stores online and it's a spinal decompression harness. I've seen it hanging on the door. Have you seen the thing where you use their, you pump your hand. That one too. I thought that's what you were talking about that. That's a good one too. I haven't used that one, but I have friends that have used that one. They like it a lot. It's not bad. It's not bad. The one that I use your hang from a door.

Speaker 1:          00:35:24       It's a little more hardcore. It's hooked up to this harness. It clips at the top of the door and you crank it. Click, click, click, click, click, click, click, and you're like literally hanging. You're hanging in there. I was going to say chair, but it just, Oh, when you get out of, yeah. Good. I'm going to try and get one of those. If you do it consistently, it'll decompress. Rarely do that. I need to do that. Yeah, you can do it in your house just to get up in the morning, you know, have you come, a wife comes and finds me. Hang on. I couldn't make it to suicide, but that dangling from the fucking doorframe thanks Joelle won't kill you. It won't kill it now. But it's um, it does mean it does feel good and it's the only way that I know of, to really stretch your neck out that way.

Speaker 1:          00:36:02       Yeah. No, I do need to do that. I try and do it in the sauna. Was it rustling the, did your yeah, for sure. For sure. Yeah. In fact, I remember it. I was going for a take down and I think I ended up headbutting the floor. A lot of it. What happened, there was one of the fighters from Alpha Male, he shot in for a take down. The guy went for a good team. Uh, and he, he spiked himself. Right. And then just never walk. Never walked. He never walked home while came paralyzed. No Way. Yeah. Cause as he shot, you know, he went and deep on the armpit, the guy went for the guillotine so his head is trapped and all their weights together, you know, feet up in the air. The whole deal. Power, power double. Yeah, no, of course. Yeah. And then you've got two body weights.

Speaker 1:          00:36:43       Yup. Go on to head and neck as, as the, uh, you know, the pressure point if you will. It Derrick Lewis who has the funniest Instagram of all time for sure. Absolutely. One on yesterday of a girl. I think she's dead. She twerked and she twerked standing on her head and then she twisted her neck and then her whole body seized up. Stiff as a board. But I'm glad you would Derek. Finding funny. I'm sure this poor woman's families, I hope she's okay. Yeah. Yeah, I do. I hope she's okay as well. But, but you know, if she's not, there's nothing to do about it now. Well No, the visit now, maybe we want take the piss out of it. It's got to, you got to look at Derek's Instagram on a daily basis because a lot of this stuff gets taken down. Oh, really? Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:37:26       Yeah. I'm surprised he hasn't been banned yet. You know, he's too popular now a lot. Derrick, for a while. He's awesome. He's, he's talking, you'll get areas he doesn't give a damn. No. Doesn't care. That's the thing. I see things. People send me things, you know, guys from back home, I got some things this morning, you know, put the massively offensive right. You know, and having a little chuckle in private. I'm not going to put that shit on Instagram. I'm not going to put it for the whole world to see. What is this? Is it doing a movie or something? He's doing a movie, I think, but then I think somebody the other day I said, uh, when John John's sneezes on. Yeah, I saw some of that caption. Oh, Jon Jones. He's an interesting character, huh? Oh yeah. Yeah. For sure. The big comeback is going to be a tough fight, man. That's a big fight. That's a big Gustafson is no joke. The way that I love the way they, they size up to the way they match up against you. See, maybe that's why John's struggled a little bit the first time because he's not used to fight in somebody with the same frame, the same physical attributes and make John sold. Great. Alex also. Yes.

Speaker 2:          00:38:35       And what was his last five? Was it, uh, to sharer? I think it was amazing in that fight. It's handled so fast, so fast. The combinations he put together there were beautiful, really, really good. The final Kao was like a video game sequence. Oh Dude. It was incredible. It really was. It really was. I mean, I think in a lot of ways that was like what we're looking at with Tyson fury and Deontay wilder, like two guys would never fought anybody that size before the for sure. Both fighting giants, both fighting is tar guys. Well, I know you had both guys on, on the show and a listen to a little bit of yesterday's with Deontae when I was picking my son up from wrestling. Um, but when I watched that fight, I sorry, not when I watched it prior to the fire happening, I thought [inaudible] was going to win.

Speaker 2:          00:39:20       Okay. Um, even though titans are very, very good technical box and for such a big man, use a lot of faints and a lot of misdirection and he's very good. Um, I thought the answer is probably going to catch him, but then when I saw that he weighed in at 212 pounds, I said, it's over. There's no way. 212 pounds. It's too much of a weight disparity. It's, it's insane. But uh, yeah, still got that knock out power man. Unbelievable. Another one when he got into the ring. Yeah, I heard you saying that to or nine. Yeah. As a fucking heavyweight. It's insane. Well, that's what I thought. I thought this guy is too light. He's like his twig. The six foot seven two oh nine crazy. It's crazy. It really is. I have fucking 12th round Kao or the Kale, the knockdown. That was insane.

Speaker 2:          00:40:07       It really was. He's got like Teddy Atlas said it best. He goes, he's like fucking sore with their hammer. But, uh, I mean all respect and credit to task and fury. Forget now, fuck. I mean, I know there was all that talk and Deontae put it on his Instagram about it. Not actually been 10 seconds about it being over 10 seconds, but still it is what it is tied to be over 10 seconds on the clock. But the referee, it's not the fighters job knowing he's his job to, to monitor. I stopped watching the corner and say, Hey, breath breath, we're at 10. No, he hasn't said 10 and he gets up fight still on, you know, there's no telling that he couldn't have got up on the actual 10. He probably could have gone up, but the actual common tenants, well, but just the way he got up and then managed to win the round.

Speaker 2:          00:40:54       Well that's what really impressed me. I wasn't the biggest fan of Tyson fury a few years ago. Uh, he, he, I don't know, we had some stupid back and forth on a, uh, on social media, on Twitter. But, uh, what was it about [inaudible] he was saying that some gypsy, John, whoever, he is knocked me out Saturday night club in Blackburn, but the only problem with that is a supposedly at the time when I was living in America. So anyway, so, so it didn't happen. I've never been knocked out at a nightclub in my life, but apparently according to Tyson it did happen. So I wasn't overly thrilled, but I've got to say over the last six months

Speaker 1:          00:41:34       or even a year, you know, he really, really won me over what he overcame illusion or that way going through that depression or a slump, whatever you want to call it. And then coming back and looking so good. And then afterwards, you know, the post fight speech I thought was beautiful. Um, donating all of his money to charity, all of it. It's just insane. I mean 10 million, you can't respect that then that, then you've got a serious problem size. So, so I applaud the guy and I'm a huge fan. Yeah. I respect the shit out of both of them. And I think that what happened with you was during his cocaine days, so was coked up and drinking like a fucking, probably probably out of his mind. He said, yeah, yeah, exactly. Who Cares? Who Cares? He went through a dark time. But you know what's fascinating to me is that he pulled himself out of it and I just pulled themselves out.

Speaker 1:          00:42:23       But I want to pull other people out too. Sure. No, absolutely. I, and again, you know, donating all that harder and money hi. And you know, you could have just given a million. Yeah. And would be, I never would have thought that was amazing as well. That would have been a huge PR stuff. But no, he gave it all. And, and that speaks volumes about the man. I mean, he even said, I don't need it. You know, he's a gypsy. He doesn't need it. He's probably made enough money to retire already. He's had some big fights. Sure. And close our fight and, and the, the rematch will be even bigger. Oh, the rematch can then be gigantic. The talking about it somewhere, April, May, June, somewhere around there. Yeah. Yeah. That's going to be fucking saying. Yeah. One of the best boxing fights I've ever seen me as well.

Speaker 1:          00:43:06       It really was incredible. Like it was it w it looked like titan was out boxing them and you know, using a lot of faints, a lot of movement, a lot of misdirection and a lot of let that Herky jerky style then that's what he does. That's how it confuses people. But then when he got clipped and dropped I was like, oh you know, I thought it was going to get caught with the left talk cause I'm saying cause we were um, there was the UFC Adelai card on at the same time and we were at the Fox studios and when the Fox did outside the UFC deal with Fox is up, they switched to Pacific CCO, PCB Pacific coast boxing of which Deontay wilder. He's one of their guys. So in the room where we were watching, watching the Adelaide card, they've got the fucking day autopilot. If Tyson fury fight on, now I've got to talk about the Adelaide card in detail and break it down and this and that.

Speaker 1:          00:43:58       But this is one of the greatest heavyweight boxing advise you've ever seen in your life going on and that screen over there. So I'm like this watch and the doing this tell us. It was crazy. It was crazy. Anyway, but as I was watching it, obviously the, I was looking for that big right hand and fury was doing a very, very good job of rolling away from it. Just a boat in that sharp. And I said, if he follows that with a left hook, he's going to catch him. And eventually that's what happened. I was exactly what it was. And as he was going down, which is even more spectrum, I think he clipped him with the first one. I clipped him with the right hand and caught him with a left hook or as he was going down. And the fact that he

Speaker 3:          00:44:32       got up after he was flat on his back, his arms are down. I think six out of 10 referees would have stopped that fight right there. They would have waved it off.

Speaker 2:          00:44:41       Oh, for sure. Yeah, no, he looked for a moment. He looked dead. Yeah, he looked out. Yeah. So part of me didn't look dead. He looked at you, looked knocked out, it looked unconscious for a few seconds, and then the lights came back on. And I know he came.

Speaker 3:          00:44:54       It's interesting when I did, when a judge or referee rather, it has a decision to make, whether or not they decided to stop a fight. And it's one of the more frustrating things ever when the referee stops a fight prematurely. It's rough. But then when you look at a fight like the Donna Stevenson fight this weekend, and I don't remember how to pronounce the Russian Gentleman's name, it's with it.

Speaker 2:          00:45:13       Geez. Yeah. He, the guy who knocked out, I didn't see this, but they're a is in hospital and in critical condition might now, correct. Yes. Yes.

Speaker 3:          00:45:21       And he's gone undergone brain surgery. He's got a, apparently he's got bleeding on the brain. And it was, uh, it was, uh, it was a good knockout, but it wasn't particularly, it wasn't insanely. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:45:33       Yeah. So when you look to that, you didn't think this guy's going to have issues. Yeah. See he sat up, he got up there like he looks like he's okay and it looked like, you know, that's the problem with boxing, you know, um, I think what, what is it, 12 to 15 deaths per year in boxing around the world? It's a very, very sad stat, I guess. You know, I mean, you involved with the UFC, you know, all the, the pro ever May, um, dialogue that's put out there. You know what? Boxing is more dangerous because he's only punches to the head and they can take more blogs. But that is the thing and get it is true blow. It is, it is true. Yeah. For sure. The slightly bigger gloves, you take more shots, which has, you know what, that's the argument get effect on the brain.

Speaker 2:          00:46:17       American football versus rugby as well. Rugby's a better, safer sport. Yeah. Which is crazy because there's no pads, no helmets, no nothing. Right. But yeah, but it's a better state of my favorite ones. Have a dad in rugby. It's not something that I hear about. It's not a narrative. I'm sure if someone's, probably not for sure exactly what sport, but I don't think it's a thing. No, but unfortunately, I mean you see, I mean the poor guys, you see kids at high school, there was one on the news I think a couple of years ago, close to where I live down here. And uh, yeah, heartbreaking. I would never let, yeah,

Speaker 3:          00:46:46       my kids play football. My kids wanted to find, I'd say, look, you're going to learn how to fight correctly, but if you want to play football, get the fuck.

Speaker 2:          00:46:52       Got It. Yeah. It's just too many guys running at you. Full clip, clash and helmet to helmet. Well that's the thing because the young kids, the young kids and you know, I remember when I was that age, you think you're invincible. So part of me you where you think you're invincible and certainly then you put on this giant helmet and you think you can just charge him with your head. You know what I mean? And unfortunately that isn't the case. We've

Speaker 3:          00:47:16       gone over some of the most recent statistics that they've released on CTE would football players and they're talking about from pop Warner to high school to college to professional the number like across the board, the number that exhibits CT symptoms

Speaker 1:          00:47:30       is staggering. Right. It's, you can only imagine the vast majority I'm sure it is. It's crazy to fucking nutty sport. Rugby's better. It's a better sport and it's a better sport. Why? In terms of, it's a bit, it's up to me. I

Speaker 2:          00:47:44       playbook bay. I used to love rugby. I was, I was a pretty good rugby player when I was younger. But uh, it seems surprising to hear that from an American and you know, I don't watch football have an America and Joe, you know who the big American flag behind you and you got the fucking, what are those? What is that?

Speaker 1:          00:47:59       That's what we'll do at least know that is a, an Asian water buffalo from [inaudible]. My next guest is it the will to visa the Asian Water Buffalo. That's from me. Good mate. Adam Green Tree. Ah, who shot that sucker and brought it over for me. Nice, nice decoration. But that's an invasive species in Australia. They shoot them out of helicopters. Oh really? They have to kill him. There's, they don't have any, any other than crocodiles, but there's no Jeremy till flesh on it. But if that thing had meat in flesh and bones, so much brilliant. Got me. I Shit my pants walking gigantic. The size of those are horns, man. And it's a huge animal. Oh, knocking on the imagine. Yeah, I was. Yeah. Cows. They're gigantic. Well, they have cows over there that are wild. They're called Scrub Bulls. Right. But you know how like we see a Rodeo rider rides a bowl and the bulls like get the crazy. Well that's because they've got testosterone and giant balls and they're fucking super aggressive. You never see a bowl in the wild.

Speaker 2:          00:48:52       I used to work at slaughter house. I used to smart 500 cows a day. The size of those fucking bowls will scare you to death hammers. I wasn't looking at the Cox. I know that. I'm saying that their balls, they're like, oh yeah, yeah, no, no. When I was 16, now that I've come from a small town and one of the, uh, the local employers is there, the slaughterhouse and anyone, any young loser like myself has done a stint at the slaughter house when they need a job, you know? And I went in and I was squeegeeing mopping blood into the drains. I was like, what the fuck is this? So I said to the forum and I said, listen, I could be of more use to you than this. He said, let me think about it. So when I've hammer break, I'm a bacon sandwich.

Speaker 2:          00:49:33       Came back and he's like, Yep, you're right. You're a good kid. I'm going to make you an apprentice. Slaughterman I was like, holy fuck, that's not what I was looking for. And talk about shocking. Oh, I'd never seen anything like it in my life. It was insane. Insane. And I'm offending all the vegans and animal lovers am an animal lover big time, you know? But, uh, it, you've got to make ends meet when you were a kid living in a small town. Yeah. Yeah. So how'd you swaddle them? Well, the, the, the, the line up single file. And eventually they come into like a little cubicle like this and you're standing above them and as they come in, you push a button, door drops down, and they're in this confined environment like a big rectangle, like a big cubicle, and you're raised up and you have this bell.

Speaker 2:          00:50:17       You touched her head and then to knock it on the head, that shoots a bolt, falls down and falls into the wall. Then you push a button and the slides up and the cow rolls down. So you went down the statue and as you ruining down, you grab what's called a puffin road. It's like a eight foot long flexible piece of plastic and he's in sterilized liquid. You pull that out as you run down. Then you put your light neon belly, you put your knee on the, uh, the head of the cow, you feel for the hole you just made in the hair. Then you get the end of the piff him Rod. He push it into the hole, he feed it all the way in until it's all the way into this. About this much at the top of the headlines Arrive by eight foot, eight foot, and you feed it all the way cause he goes down the spinal column.

Speaker 2:          00:51:03       So you're, you're, you're killing all that. You killing all the nerve endings. Wow. Eyes are popping out of his head to things fucking kicking like a maniac. You've got your knee on it. Then you pull that out, put it back in the sterilized thing. You get a chain, put it around the rear foot, push a button. It's strange. You don't pull out your knife here to here. It guts elevator doors like the shining blood everywhere. Does it. Next one run back upstairs. Netscout's goal and if you're not quitting and I go, mother Fucker, let's go. Come on. 500 a day. I was such a person has such a little bit, I couldn't do it. I'm going to fuck this. Fuck this. I'm going to have nightmares when I go home. I did it for about two weeks and I'm like, yeah, I'm out. I'm out.

Speaker 2:          00:51:45       See you buddy. Too. Disturbing way to disturb him and, and, and the people that work there a little disturbed as well, you know, going imagine you'd get a little twisted a couple of years in job. I mean, I think they were fucking with me cause I was a kid. Right. You know, because obviously from there then they get, you know, the chance odd in half and they start looking like meat, you know, they'd go up and they take it back. Yeah. Ticket by Mike. It's an acquired taste, you know, and it would eat it, raw it dead. They were just doing it to fuck with me, you know, you know what I mean? Little 16 year old kid wet behind the ears. But uh, yeah, I didn't know that was stuck of rod through this, the whole in the brain all the way through the spot. It's pretty shocking.

Speaker 2:          00:52:25       You know, I've never even heard of something like that. Yeah. Pythian Rod, that's what you call. Wow. I wonder if that's standard practice still today because I never, I've never seen it. I've seen some awful Peter slaughterhouse. Yeah, yeah. But they died quick. It was weird. Instantly it very, very quick. Yeah. And you get through enough in one day, I couldn't do it. Now there's no way I could do it now as when you're young, you know, you morals change as you get older, your feelings or your values change couldn't do it would, if that was the only source of meat, it was mild sauce, salsa and you meat, then the mother fuckers, Dane. You know what I mean? Yeah. But I'm not a a, I know you're a big hunting guy. I'm not a bit, well, I've never been hunted in my life, but if you're gonna eat it to live and then then, then good for you. Of course. You know, it serves a purpose. Yeah. Well, I became a hundred because of those videos. Which videos? So it was Peter videos of slaughterhouses. Oh really? Yeah. Now I want to have any part of that. I know we're well, exactly. And I know, and I, I respect that. I do. I'm

Speaker 1:          00:53:26       not so much into their, well, I detest it. Trophy hunting and things like that, you know, I know that's a no, no, I'm not into it either. I mean, I really don't understand the desire to hunt something. You're not interested in eating [inaudible] rich businessmen flying out to Africa and you know, shooting a majestic base or an elephant or a lion from a distance. There's no water in that. There's no honor in shooting Elian even from close up. But from desk is hiding in the bushes and pulling a fucking trigger. Anything that makes you a man, even though, you know, the only way that makes sense to me is if you're in a part of Africa where lions are consistently killing your livestock and you have to protect your livestock, which is yet Colorado. There's a big issue with mountain lions and Sean and a lot of it, Wyoming, there's a lot of places that have hunting seasons on mountain lions.

Speaker 1:          00:54:16       Absolutely. Yeah. I wouldn't say there's a hard and fast rules for everything in different environments, different situations than you need, you know, a different approach, you know? Well, you know that Cecil the lion thing and that whole story that went down and you know what happened? I, uh, I'm pretty, if you remind me, I think I know about it. I remember hearing something about it. A famous majestic lion that was in this park and the lion left the park and went into this area where it's legal for them to hunt. And a hunter who was a dentist from America shot this lion, right? And everyone became very mad at this guy because the line had a collar on it, which meant that there was a line that they were tracking. Because the thing is that they can't see the collar when they're trying to shoot it.

Speaker 1:          00:54:58       They have this giant Maine, there's no way you're gonna see this dentist from somewhere in America. So he's a fucking asshole in my territory where I'm allowed to shoot. All right. Gray area, I guess. But the fact that you're flying out to fucking Africa to shoot majestic base for me, that that's a weak excuse. It is it from a guy that you just fucking kill five of cows a deck. Here's where it's fucked up for a week. And I was an apprentice. I didn't really do it very often when the very nice flash hit in all these people were furious at that guy and then no one wanted to go over there and hotlines. So because no one wanted to go over there and hunt lions, the lion population exploded when the lion population exploded. The undulate population or the, you know, antelope and all those and yet have dropped radically.

Speaker 1:          00:55:41       She saw the wildlife biologists made an assessment that they had to kill some lions so they killed, I think they wound up killing 200 lions and just dumping their bodies. Whereas for the money would have gone for those 200 lines, they would have gotten $50,000 for each line of a hunter had taken them. And then what they've done, they take that money, they pour it back into conservation. It's a very messy business. Sure, absolutely. You know, and then there you go. There is the, the the argument for it. Yeah, but it's a tricky argument to eight. It is a tricky argument because I don't have the answers and I'm not educated enough to really sit here and debate or really cast any kind of opinion on any one really. I just shooting an animal from a distance. I'm not a fan of. That's about it from a distance.

Speaker 1:          00:56:26       You kind of have to, yeah, no, for sure. I can force you to elk up close. That's a real problem. Oh yeah. No, actually you gonna shoot first and I'm not talking about you going out and, uh, I've, I've seen your videos on your barbecue. It looks fucking delicious. You should try it. I'm sure it's great. I'm sure it's awesome. I have no issue with that. I have you. So please. I would love to eat it. You Go. Holy Shit. I'm sure I would. Doesn't taste like anything else, man. I love meat. I'm a carnivore for sure. Um, but yeah, yeah, no, you're right. Look, it's the argument for it. You can make the same argument for people. Hey, we'll keep these people healthy. We just kill a couple of, well, there you go. Exactly how you have these really rich people come over from Germany.

Speaker 1:          00:57:06       They spend $100,000 no kill a few poor people, and that the rest of the poor people, they're going to get all this money and there'll be more houses for them. All right now there, visit enough accommodation for everybody to live in. Let's just slow, let's just call, which is 2000 let them loose in the hills and we'll chase him with bows and just kill a few of these people. It's tricky, you know, it's not good. It's not. It's the kill some of the rapists and murderers coming over the border, job solved, and then the other, the other problem is even the animals that make sense. I don't think there's rapists and murderers coming off the bottom was probably, let's be honest, most of them were just poor folks and want a better, oh, for sure. Yeah, no shame on that. You're an immigrant. My family, I mean, we're all proud product of immigrants and so 100 but yeah, of course you native American, he's probably shut the fuck up 100% there you go.

Speaker 1:          00:57:51       Yeah. No, that's totally fair. Yeah, no, I know. That's the funny thing. I'm like, really fucking show me a third generation American in this country. Did the hard to come across. They are, you know everybody I meet out here claims to be English when I made them out. Have my mom, my fucking Auntie's English or Irish or they'll claim to be out. You guys love to claim an Irish descent. Really? Oh yeah. Is this recent? This is because of Conor McGregor. You guys fucking love. Declare my, my mom's Irish. My mom has an Irish accent. Okay. She fucking talks like desk maker. She's Avish as the car. I've never once claimed to be Irish. There you go. I use what I say to everybody. They're like, oh yeah, I'm Swiss. I'm Italian. I'm this. Does anybody in your immediate family talk with an Italian accent? Now we'll shut the fuck up because you're American. Okay. And that's okay. That's okay. Be Proud of that. Yeah, you're not English. Just cause you great. Great, great, great grandmother grew up in Ipswich or Gloucester or somewhere. Does it make you, you English love? So your kids, your kids' kids will be American. Oh yeah. Well, yeah, we got green cards recently, so yeah. Oh yeah. They will be. Yeah. How does that work? You have to mind your p's and q's. If you get in trouble over here, they ship you back.

Speaker 1:          00:59:08       Um, I guess that's tricky, right? That's one good thing about what I'm, okay. You know, 20 years ago it would have been an issue, but these days I'm a fireman. I'm a gentleman and I'm going to find gentleman, Jack, come on. Businessman,

Speaker 2:          00:59:23       a commentator. God cast. You're doing movies the place. Yeah. I forget what. They don't have to worry. We're not, we're not hanging out in bars getting knocked out by Gypsies. They were the old days. You aren't getting into the movie business, right? You've been doing a few movies. Why aren't you doing a movie during the time you were doing the Rockhold fight? That's right. Yeah. I was filming triple X. Yeah. Yeah. I've been out there for about three months and then I was flying home and I was looking for some walkie talkies for my seven year old. Uh, I don't know why I thought that'd be a good idea. It turns out getting hold of walkie talkies isn't very easy these days. I've went on a fucking wild goose chase trying to get these fucking walkie talkies that didn't even get played with. He was like, yeah, cool.

Speaker 2:          01:00:04       I've got a phone dad. I like, yeah, I should've thought of that. But um, and as I'm looking for them, I check Twitter, I've got a coffee and a see Chris Weidman and pulled out. So yeah, it takes Dane and I said, listen, if this is true, you know, you know where I am. And he was like, oh great, we love that, you know, blah blah blah blah blah. But Jack Arrays our first option. So I thought for a minute there, I thought I was getting a title shot and I thought, there's no way Jackie is going to turn it down. So I went to my buddy's Jason's house and watched the basketball game and I had a few drinks and you know, it didn't party as such. I was on set the next day, but had a few drinks. Now, if I knew I was fighting for a world belt in two weeks, you know, I would have been on a strict diet, not overindulging but I definitely over indulged.

Speaker 2:          01:00:47       And then the next day and walking into the gym, just have, you know, just a little light workout and my phone starts exploding lighting up like a Christmas tree and like what the hell? And then our aerial Hawaiian, he calls me, is that Mike Dana just announced a sports center that you're fighting for the belt. What the fuck? I was the first day I heard about it. I look fucking Dana, we all, God bless him. So, um, that whole shit. So I'm panicking like crazy. How much did you work? So that's the first thing I did. I ran into the changing of, got on the scale. I was like two 15, two 16 cause that rough. Yeah, for sure. Yeah, I like to do like a week before I like to be 200 pounds. So this is two weeks before and um, I'm 215 so my shit screwed the weights and need to run.

Speaker 2:          01:01:31       So I just run out at the gym, throw my backpack on my shoulders and just of sprinting through Toronto city center, like a mad man. Of course there's traffic lights every 30 seconds. So I don't want to stop at the traffic lights cause that's no good. So I'm just running out, nearly getting one over by taxis and jumping over homeless people falling over, ducking and dive. And it was great training. And um, and then Dana called, who's I'm negotiating, you know, the Fi whilst running through Toronto. And then, uh, carried on going and then I end up laying in the middle of nowhere. I just running and running and running. And then Jason Parillo gets on the phone and uh, you know, all the doubt starts creeping in. I start thinking, Jesus Christ is salt. Typical of my career, I've wanted a towel fight my whole career.

Speaker 2:          01:02:13       You know, I've been through many ups and downs and now here I am. I get the towel fights on two weeks. Notice I'd be filming a God damn movie. I've been near a gym, MMA gym for a while doing anything unless against somebody that's already beaten me. So I'm kind of destined to fail this soft fucking typical. And then Jason got on the phone and you know, he talks to round big time. You know, I said a lot of very positive things. Jason's an amazing coach. Absolutely is incredible. It really is. There's a lot of, it was a lot of trainers out there. Uh, there's a lot of pad men. You know, there's a lot of fakers in mixed martial arts. Certainly these days. You know, I mean guys that really have true heritage in martial arts or any kind of steep history in combat sports, they're few and far between.

Speaker 2:          01:02:55       You know, you can train, any guy can watch a video and it's a little bit of coordination, how to hold pads and you see them. It's all the crazy, isn't it? These days in pads to get fit, you know, one, two left talk, Woo. You know, just cause you can do that and hold it doesn't make you, a coach does not make you a coach. And there's a lot of fakers out there, but Jason is not one of them. He speaks from the heart and he knows what the fuck he's talking about. And we had a good chat and by the end of it I was, I was feeling a lot better. And uh, yeah. So when you were filming that movie, were you working out at all? I was doing vanity workouts. I like to run certainly when I'm in a city. So I was running probably three or four days a week of 4.2 mile run.

Speaker 2:          01:03:41       Yeah. Yes. So as I was running and I was lifting weights a few times a week, you know, biceps and shoulders, you know what I mean? Yeah. The chest, press luck, lots of jazz press, you know what I mean? Uh, and then, um, GSPs coach Jorge Blanco. Do you know Jorge? No, I don't. It's very, very, very good trainer. I'm Rashad Evans put me onto him whilst I was up there. I went to see him like two or three times, you know, uh, but no, not, not training as such, but uh, yeah, all worked out. But it exercise. But sometimes that's good anyway. Right? So it gives your body a chance to recover. Well, that's what I said afterwards because I went into that fight feeling so strong, feeling so good. I'm like, cause I consistently have a trend every single fight in my career apart from that one.

Speaker 2:          01:04:26       Uh, and I said, oh, I'll learn from this. I'll learn from this. And you don't, and it's like Jason Parillo always says, um, it takes confidence to take a day off to rest the body, you know? And now of course there's a fine line between having the confidence to take a day off and being a lazy bastard and said, I'm going to sit on the couch today. You know? But if you could, if you know, listen, I'm good. I'm going to take a day or two off cause I need it, you know? So that was one of the mistakes I made with my career. I always trained too much in Jason said, you know, I used to mind fuck myself because it meant so much to me. You know, my fight career meant so much to me. I used to overcomplicate it over analyze, you overwork it, stress myself out with it, you know, and uh, that, that was hindering my performances.

Speaker 2:          01:05:14       You know, I never once fought to the, to my ability of, I performed in the gym, never once. Uh, I remember one day I pulled up outside Ruca and Jason was waiting for me outside and I pulled up and he says, Mike, come in and cut me. Have a quick chat. I said, yeah, what's up? He said, listen buddy, you go guys in there. Okay. He said, but you're a fucking world champion. Can you go in there and spar these guys and act like a world champion? They're here. You're up there, act like it. Don't go in, lose your fucking tempest. Spazz out. Stress out at like a dig. Say things you regret. You know when the spine is not quite necessarily going your way, you have, you know, you get a little pissed off or whatever, you know, say Jiu Jitsu coaches catching you and tapping you out a little bit and you start getting a little frustrated.

Speaker 2:          01:05:58       He said, can you just, you know, how can we have none of that place and great advice. Just like when I, uh, I was fighting for the belt when I flew home from doing that movie, I went straight to the gym when I landed. And, uh, Jason said to me, cause I was always stressed, you know, and he said, listen, um, we don't know if you're going to win this fight, Mac. You know, fingers crossed, I believe in you. I believe you're gonna win this fight, but we don't know if you're going to win this fight. So this might be the only time you're ever going to fight for a world title. Right. I said, well, yeah, but he said, well, let's enjoy the process. You know, let's go through this with a smile on your face. He said, this is huge. He said, you're in a position that everyone would kill to be in. You're fighting for the championship, you're find for the belt. You've wanted this whole, this your whole life, enjoy this. You know, and it was such amazing advice cause I was like, yeah, you're right. And I went through the whole thing and the big smile on my face,

Speaker 3:          01:06:53       new clip. Rockhold I remember thinking, Holy Shit, when I see rock holds legs buckle and I see him stagger backwards. I was like, Holy Shit. He got him. And then when he stumbling as the cage and you bashed him and stopped him,

Speaker 2:          01:07:09       I'm going to help but laugh because you know it does bring a smile to her.

Speaker 3:          01:07:12       Almost like I couldn't believe it. It was like a, like a movie. It was like, it was, it was one of those things because you were a big underdog coming third fight. Everybody know you took it on short notice. Everybody knew that you were working on a movie and so for you to land that when you landed that left hand, you missed it once before too. And I remember thinking like, man, that is fucking close. That's close. Like you saw this opening for that left hand and you, you clipped him over the top of the shoulder. It didn't see it. Common Bang. You drop that left hand on his chin and you see like his eyes rolled back and his legs give out

Speaker 2:          01:07:43       black man. Well that was the whole plan, the left Hook, you know, Jason and seeing that it was open for that and I'd seen it was open for that and he was even doing this exercise on these bands are like a resistance bands, whatever it was doing this and his chin was open, his right hand was down at the end of it. And Jason said he's, he's Julian needs moves here and he's finishing here that left hook all day long. And um, you know, he's coming forward and we're exchanging punches and nothing really significant as Landon. And I just ran up to the battery, just whipped the left talk. And you know, as a, when you, when you land a good shot, you, cause you get the feedback on your fist, there's nothing like it. You know what I mean? When, when you, when you feel that, that solid connection and the knuckles got through the glove, you know, and you feel it, you're like, oh, that was a good one.

Speaker 2:          01:08:29       And then he falls down on that holy shit all around and then he gets back up on that, fuck you bomb back down. And then, uh, he went down and obviously he's got very good Jujitsu and he was kind of sat back against the fence and I thought, I've got to be careful not to go in his guard, but uh, yeah, I got the finish. Felt the best feeling I've ever felt in my life was big John Mccarthy's gigantic forearm, nearly pulling my head off my shoulders as he wrestled me off him. But he knew it was over because I knew it was over. It was great. What did that feel like when you knew you did it? One of the best feelings in the world? One of the best, because you know, for me, you know, the amount of fights I've had, this unbelievable professionally and unprofessionally, you know, and when I was a kid, that's all I was, you know, that that was my only identity has been a fire.

Speaker 2:          01:09:19       You know, I'm just being that, that guy, you know, unfortunately rightly or wrongly works wrongly, wrongly, you know, of course it is. You know, I was, I was a fucking idiot when I was a kid. I was fighting so much, but that's what I clung to, you know, I was a fire and that was the only thing that I could draw pride from, you know, and, uh, be becoming the world champion, knowing that everybody wrote me off knowing that everyone talk shit about me, you know, uh, other fighters just, just, you know, it was everywhere. [inaudible] I heard what people always said about me. Do you know what I mean? So to, to win lie that in style and the first one. Yeah. Yeah. It felt amazing. It is right there. Oh yeah, yeah. [inaudible] was very upset. Yeah, he was. Yeah. You know, you talked a lot of shit too and you, and after you beat him, well, well, hold on.

Speaker 2:          01:10:10       I know my wife was behind me there and she deserves a shout out because if it wasn't for her, none of this would've happened. But, uh, with Rockhold with what happened after the fight. So I, okay, there's a few things that I regret that have heard after the fact. First of all, I jumped on the fence and I'm just all worked up Husky that fuck you, whatever. No big deal. I'm not, I'm not too concerned about that one. Um, and then as I'm doing my lap of victory dance, if you will, um, I, I do a lap of the octagon and I crossed paths with, with Luke part of me and I'm like, Hey, you know, you say whatever you say, unlucky bird, you know, a good fire, whatever. Bubba, Bubba, bubba. I said that. And I carried on having my mom and I was just out of my mind on Adrenalin and just having a great time.

Speaker 2:          01:10:52       And then I found myself, I'd done an entire lap of the octagon again and I was passing him again. So I just thought I'd extended my curtsy one more time. I'm like, yeah, you know, and I put my hand out and he said, oh, really? Shook your hand. I'm like, oh, really? You're still going to be a decade. Is that yet? I already shook your hand. So then I was like, okay, well now the gloves are off. I said, don't worry about it. You're in an octagon. You've just been knocked out. It's okay. You'll figure it out in a minute. Don't worry about it. You'll come to buy, you'll be good. So I kind of look like an asshole because people didn't see that he would, it was used to shake my hand the second time. You know, I was like, well go fuck yourself then. And then when you gave me the microphone, when you gave him the microphone, I said the most crude comments ever I'm at, I've been fighting ever since. I care about it. My mother, I'm not whoa. That's not an image that I want to portray to the world when the world belt, you know, what I meant was ever since I've been born. Right. You know, but in, in the moment, the word's escaped me a little bit and then I painted a rather disturbing image of my mother giving birth to me. But, uh, but yeah, I didn't choose my words too carefully though, but, uh, yeah, no, it was great man.

Speaker 3:          01:11:56       Be held accountable for that. I mean, that's it. There's no one that's ever gonna be able to understand that other than someone who wins the title. Yeah. No one's going to know what that felt like. Oh, it's impossible.

Speaker 2:          01:12:05       18 it was incredible. It really was. It really was. Yeah. I can only imagine it was good while it was good.

Speaker 3:          01:12:12       Just happy that for you. Uh, you know, having a chance to see all your fights and see your career go for as long as it went that you did go out with a title that is,

Speaker 2:          01:12:21       yeah, for sure. Yeah. You know, I mean, as I say a, that was for me, I'm not sure. Well, I wouldn't have retired. I wouldn't have retired. Yeah, yeah. No, no, because, because I, I know I could still do it. I can still find now, you know, I can still, but, but the time was right. You know, and then I started having issues with my good eye as well after the gas Dillon fight. So I'm like, this isn't worth it

Speaker 3:          01:12:47       now because you, you had oil in one of your eyes. Yeah. Yeah. Can you explain how that was going on?

Speaker 2:          01:12:52       Yeah. So when I detached my retina, um, they did what's called a [inaudible]. Uh, if you, if you've watched their surgery, it's absolutely disgusting. But, uh, one of the things that they do, the gas inside your eye, and I think if I'm getting this wrong, I apologize to all doctors, but the kind of kind of helps hold the retina in place. Um, but you can't fly with that. And I was filming a movie in England a few weeks later. I said, and I said, you can't do the US and I'm filming a movie. And they went, okay, there's another way we can do it. It's a little more unconventional. We can put oil inside there, but then with that you can fly. So I'm like, okay, cool. Do that. So, uh, they did that. Uh, yeah. You know, it's,

Speaker 4:          01:13:38       yeah.

Speaker 2:          01:13:39       Nah. And then we detoxed and then I've got glaucoma. I just had a lot of bad luck. I did whatever can go wrong with an I trust me. I went through it. But it looks different now. Yeah, it does. Yeah, it does. Yeah. But it looks better than it looked before was great. What did you do? It looks great. Don't worry about it. Job. Oh, you want to talk? No, no, you're good. You got it. It's okay. It's a, it's a corrective lens. Oh, okay. It's a corrective lenses. A prosthetic.

Speaker 3:          01:14:06       So can you see,

Speaker 2:          01:14:08       I see, I see. Um, a tiny, tiny, tiny, tiny, tiny, tiny bit. Oh, really? Yeah. So I don't, I don't really see out of it and divisions very blurred. I'm going to, I was able to pass the test to pass, to be able to clear by commission to buy, you got to have 2100 vision, which I was able to scrape by with the skin of my teeth. Wow. You know, so I'm a doctor was always amazed that I could still see to that amount if I, if I squinted in the right direction and a Turd here and the light was just right, I could just about make out 2100. Wow. So, uh, but what happens is then that then, cause you see in two different images distorted him and you see your brain councils the distorted one, you know, so with the depth perception remains the same.

Speaker 2:          01:14:50       No depth perception is a real issue. Yeah. Yeah. You know, uh, it was an issue throughout my last few fights. For me, the main thing, I mean, as I say, you know, uh, I was cleared medically by the doctors and you know, the UFC were very, very on top of all of that. The UFC, you know, send me to a number of different doctors and whatnot. And as I say, uh, uh, pass the test just, but it was, and every time I did the doctors were like, we don't recommend that you fight. You know, you of course, 2100 vision, it's still clinically blind. Uh, yeah. Yeah, yeah. So, um, but, but yeah, yeah, there you go. That's fucking crazy. Yeah. But it never slowed me down. It didn't slow it down. That's what's crazy. Looking back now, lay fi, not that I sit there at night and get drunk and watch my old fights.

Speaker 2:          01:15:39       I've never done that once. But if I ever do see some old fights back, which occasion just happens by chance, you know, afterwards, I'm always calling for a shot at the belt or whatever. I said to my wife, fuck with this guy. Thank you. Get out of it. He's out of his mind, you know, absolutely out of his mind. But at that time, it quitting and trying to not be come the champion did not even occur to me for a split second. Giving up never even occurred to me for a heartbeat. Why is that? Is this how you've always been? This is something I still felt. I still felt that I could, I could win it. Simple as that, you know? Uh, but a lot of guys, if they lost most of the use of one of their eyes would have been done. Yeah, for sure. No, no chance. It's not worth it. Yeah. No, I know. Um, and

Speaker 5:          01:16:28       okay,

Speaker 2:          01:16:29       probably the smart thing to do would it, what would have been one of those guys, but for me, you know, I, I, it meant a lot to me. I want it. I wanted to become the champion. I knew I could become the champion contrary to popular belief. And um,

Speaker 2:          01:16:45       this is me. They, they, it was my identity. And until I won that belt, I wasn't happy. Now when I want it, my wife said she wanted me to be. So when I fought Luke in, in La, she said, if you win, I want you to retire. I said, Bev, if I lose then I'll retire. Okay. Cause Fair enough. I got my towel sharp. You know, it didn't go on my way. It is what it is. I would have had closure on that. I said, well, if win. Yeah. The fucking mind. If you think I'm going to retire, you come on, on the jump into the world. I got to milk it for a little bit, finally earn some decent pay days, you know. Uh, so yeah, but um, it all worked out or the big fight with GSP. Oh yeah. That's why that took place because you had that belt.

Speaker 2:          01:17:26       Yeah. You know, I mean, I mean, joy joy's beat me fair and square that night. But, uh, there was a lot going on going into that camp that, uh, the final week and, and again, I never said anything at the time because God bless George and he's a great guy and I respect the hell out of George. I really do. How can you not, you know, I mean, I know I talked to all that shit, lead it into the fire, but that was just me having a laugh, you know? I was literally having fun with it. You know? No ill will towards George seem like you're enjoying it. Yeah. Just having fun, just busting balls. You know what I mean? I think George is incredible. I think George is the consummate professional, easier inspiration to all aspiring martial artists out there. If there's one man, you can muddle your career on the way Twain's the way he looks after his body, the way cross trains George Saint Pierre will be that man.

Speaker 2:          01:18:11       You know, he's an inspiration to myself, you know, so, uh, nothing but the greatest of respect. But people, as we said at the start of the show, that doesn't sell. People don't want to see that. People don't want to see that, so I'll play the bad guy. I've been portrayed as the bad guy my entire career, you know, by the UFC, the editing, you know, I've fallen foul to some creative editing. I've fallen foul to my own mouth as well at time. So, you know, come on. You know, I'm my own worst enemy as well. But um, the week before the phone, yeah, we, before the fight, uh, I had the best training camp and my life, you know, uh, sounds braggy, but knocking out multiple sparring partners, not on purpose. It just felt incredible. It felt absolutely incredible. Final sparring session. We had my protein, they'd flown in for a photo shoot or someone else there for a photo shoot.

Speaker 2:          01:19:03       The Gym's absolutely packed and we got some guys in their aspiring me and um, you know, everybody wants to be the guy, you know, the, the, the guests to take down or whatever or get to submission on the guide. That's, you know, that's how it is. That's why I don't like gone to too many MMA gyms when I was fine because every time you walk in you have a target on your back. Anyway, it was the final round. We did five rounds, it was the Friday before the fight and this guy shooting shoot a double leg ones. We all the way across the octagon, like his life depended on, it, depended on it, picked me up, slammed me down and his shoulders went right into my ribs and I felt it instantly. Just all the cartilage tor completely. And I just started swearing and screaming, fuck fucking, you know, cause I knew, I knew I went a saw a doctor and Warner and a yeah, it wasn't good.

Speaker 2:          01:19:52       So I was, I got treatment everyday and I was having nice on me and all that type of stuff. Uh, but uh, it, it wasn't working. So what we came up with Kevin with his plan, it was going to inject myself with lighter came before the fight cause it, cause it will nomia but the problem is the area where it was was, uh, you, you can pass along. It's where I have to go in. You could piss a lot of bleed to death cause internal bleeding is yet. So I got this doctor, I was going to add the needle ahead, the light again and I was going to fucking go in and sneak into the toilet and facetime the doctor and he was like, okay. And anyway, the whole thing, can we just do it on top of it was, it was bullshit. I was like, fuck this, this is the stupidest plan ever.

Speaker 2:          01:20:37       Bollocks to it. I'll fire with the sore rib eye bit of Adrenalin and you're not, I've got to feel it anyway, which I didn't under night, you know. But people said, Oh, you didn't look yourself in there. You weren't moving too much. Said yeah, no shit. I couldn't move. But uh, but as I said, hey all credit to George, God bless him. He did great. Did you, there was a sparring partner that you had sparked with regularly. He'd came. Ed Dina. I'm a singer. Great Guy. Just came in from England for the last couple of weeks. So as dean, who took you down? Dean very well. Do you know dean? Yeah, yeah. Fucking day in the Prager dude. What the fuck, dude? Yeah, no, he's a great guy. Deans are so he's great. Yeah, he's great. You know, it's the way it goes. You training and a, yeah. What are you going to do?

Speaker 2:          01:21:18       So many fights went, that was half El dos Anjos when he's supposed to fight McGregor, like last, last sparring kicks and elbows and breaks his foot. Oh, so that's why Diaz care men. Ah, yeah. It has happened to so many guys. Such a fine line because, because you feel good, you've trained so hard, you feel great and you think, ah, like your coach will say, okay, let's call it there guys. We're good. Call there and you're like, I don't know. I feel good. Come on, let's get one good one is because sometimes I normally train a spar Monday, Wednesday, Friday, and if the Wednesday spire goes really well, you know, let's end it there because you want to end on a really good spar. You know what I mean? Because you, you feel like a world champion, you feel great. You know, I, you remember how you handled all your sparring partners and w whatever good shots you landed and you didn't really take any damage.

Speaker 2:          01:22:08       That's a great, that's great momentum to go into the fight with. And you don't know if you have another spy section, it's going to go like that. You might be tired, you might be worn down. Those guys might be on their game that day. And if you get a Tufts by session, well then you want to do one more because you can't go into a fight after getting your ass kicked in a sparring session. You know what I mean? That's not good Karma or energy to go in there with. Um, so it's always a weird one to find. It's fine balancing gags. But uh, yeah, there you go. Do you, uh, when you look back on your career, would you have done anything differently in terms of what the way you prepare it?

Speaker 6:          01:22:41       MMM,

Speaker 2:          01:22:44       yeah, for sure. For sure. A lot of things. Yeah. Yeah. You know, I mean

Speaker 2:          01:22:50       time machine. Yeah. And you'd shoot again. I do way more things, which is all different. Well one, I wouldn't balloon up in between fights, discipline between fights, you know, I didn't exercise enough of in between fights. Yeah. A little too much. You know, these days I look after my body way more now than when I was fine. It's so fucking hypocritical. You know, it's so silly now. Um, well cause now I don't have the luxury of going through a fight camp to get in shape. You know what I mean? So now I've got to stay in shape. Simple as that. Whereas in the past I'm like, yeah, whatever. I'll have a pizza, I'll have a few beers I have for dessert, I'll do, I'll, I'll eat whatever I want and then when I'm in training camp, switch it on. But it's not good for the body. So that would be one. Um, yeah, many things. Many things, you know, I don't really want to throw anyone under the bus or whatever,

Speaker 1:          01:23:40       but yes, training was, did this things I would have changed, you know, there, there was a group of people that I was involved with in England for a while. Definitely when a wouldn't have wasted my time with us. Fucking assholes. Did you get clear of all that legally now? Not yet. Still going on this Friday. There's another hearing in the courts. Yeah. She's lots of lies. Lots of this has been going on for eight years. He has something like that. Yes. It's 2011. So I remember you telling me about this when we were in England together. Yeah. That was a long time ago, man. It was a very long time ago. Yeah. What are you going to do that there's a lot of scumbags out there. People that want to take your money. So it's hard for young fighters too when they get contractually obligated to someone that doesn't suit them later in their career. But then they started becoming successful and they're still contractually obligated to those three for sure. That it's a very common issue with fighters. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          01:24:31       Well for me, I was contractually obligated, uh, I kept my mouth shut. I, I did my five years and move down. But uh, they saw it a different way. So they came out with from totally fabricated nonsense about camp bill is going back to 2006 they just created invoices and just just totally fabricated an entire case. Not a single email, not a single signature, nothing. It's laughable that even got this far. But if you've got brass balls on you and you're willing to stick to a story and talk a lot of shit and lie you, you can, you can go a long way it seems, but I don't want to talk about that too,

Speaker 1:          01:25:07       cause they're a pub in and getting fucking suit again. You thought about training fighters.

Speaker 2:          01:25:14       I would love to. Yeah. I really would love to because I feel this was one of my issues as I was a coach. So part of me as a, as a fighter because believe it or not, you know, I mean I retired at 39 years old. Um, and at the time it had the most fights in the UFC, you know, whatever, believe it or not, I know a thing or two about how to prepare for a mixed martial arts fight, you know? So that was one of my conflict things always with my coachees. I not that I didn't respect them, but I, I would always kind of feel maybe I should be doing this or she'll be doing that and, and, and that's what I would do a lot of the time. I was like Cadillac, the head coach. I mean, Jason Parillo was probably the head coach, but I would like be the one that did the program and need to work on this.

Speaker 2:          01:25:57       I'll see that guy on that day, you know? Um, so yeah, I would love to. I would love to. Right now I've got a lot of things going on and, and life is good, so I don't really have the time to dedicate myself to it. Right. And actually I'm kind of enjoying just, well, I'm still working for the UFC, doing the, you know, the Fi coverage stuff. But it's enjoyable to be doing something different. You'd have to being submerged in it, totally submerged for so long, it's refreshing to be doing something else, you know? So, uh, but, but, but one day I would love to for sure.

Speaker 3:          01:26:30       Well you're seeing it with fighters. Um, there's some of them that are making those transitions into training and who better to know what it's like to prepare for a fight and someone like yourself who had so many fights in the UFC. I mean, if it's almost like that knowledge and experiences almost wasted or at least goes the, the experience of how to prepare kind of goes away if you, if you don't pass it off, he, because otherwise someone has to go through all this stuff.

Speaker 2:          01:26:57       Yeah, absolutely. Joe. Um, and the, and that's partly why I do want to do that. When the time comes, as I say it, would it be fair to anybody right now because I haven't got the time to commit right now. I'm working on some things and hopefully they all come off and, uh, I've got some free time and I can sit on my ass. You know, everyone's always like, oh, congrats on the retirement. I'm like, fucking retirement. I'm working harder than ever these days. You know, maybe I need to come out of retirement to get some free time back, you know. Uh, but, um, when the time comes, I would love to do that.

Speaker 3:          01:27:26       That is the best case scenario though, your situation because you, you've retired into a very profitable career, whereas there's a lot of fighters they're lost when it's over. They don't know what to do.

Speaker 2:          01:27:37       Always scared me. Yeah. Always scared. Good for you, good for you for thinking like that. Terrified me right from day one. So I left school at 16 me and no education, like a fucking idiot. That's one of my big regrets in life. Small town boy, you know, northwest of England. Not a lot going on there. Beautiful little town, but you know, tiny little town, uh, not a lot of opportunity and just fell into a Rut, you know, working minimum wage in factories, you know, from seven in the morning until six o'clock at night, just doing mundane medial shit in on. And I hated it. I hated it. I really did. And that's why I became a fiery ultimately. And it was a very well planned decision, you know, the whole, the whole story to me coming to do this was a, it didn't happen overnight.

Speaker 2:          01:28:24       You know, there was a steps to it. What was your first discipline? I started doing Japanese Jujitsu when I was eight years old and I was obsessed with it. So that's how you knew how to clear the sword. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I was obsessed with Japanese Jujitsu. Reallocate. It's a great, it's great. Yeah, I was doing, she, we didn't know it was Emma back then, but we were fighting in MMA. We called it knocked down sport Buddha. If you, if you Google it, you can bring it up. You can pick up some of my FYS knockdown sport Butoh yeah. Which is MMA, bare knuckle. Uh, and we have like these international tournaments against, you know, men. I was about 15, something like that at the time. But uh, yeah, so we do tons of that stuff. When I was younger, you know, I was, as I say, obsessed with martial arts in pretty much one every single tournament I ever went in.

Speaker 2:          01:29:10       And then on top of that, and I was a little shit out and about as well. So I was having plenty of fight experience. And then as I said, just dead end job after dead end job after dead end job. And I got to a phase in my life and met my wife Rebecca and we had kids. I was like, it's this is this or that. Life is going to be, you know, and then my boss at work at the time, Mick, he said to me, my, you're pretty intelligent guys. This is what you want to do for the rest of your life. And I'm like, fuck no. He's like, what? Oh, here we go. Here's one of them. This is wild. Yeah. May Fight Club Shit. I mean, even the seedy dark looking background, the weird lighting. This is like a scene in the movie.

Speaker 2:          01:29:50       He walked through fire and you walked through fire to get here. Oh Jesus. You do actual fire. Oh, it's like smoking. There's another one actually did, which is true to my, uh, puts good headed on this. This is why all the way you guys are dressed and everything. Yeah. I to this day think that fight should be held in this sort of a scenario where there's a large open open air place like a basketball court. I just feel like the cage is such a factor in fight. No, it really is. It really is. And it allows, I mean you can use the, there's one more on there if you can find it Jamie, which is pretty funny. The joke had a good laugh and so will everybody else cause I guess the early Michael Bisping was on display, we Bauer eg over and I kick him in the face right off the bat.

Speaker 2:          01:30:40       But you know the referee at Ted fight. Um, yeah, the cage. You can use it as a, uh, you know, it's, it's, it's another weapon. You can stall on it. You can lean on it, you use it to stand up. It's a factor. It's a huge factor in, in the UFC. And it's hard to see sometimes if you're in the crowd and you've got to post there as a brand, you wind up looking at the screens. Yeah, no, absolutely you do. I was having a me Lewis on one of our episodes recently. He was saying, you know, usually when I probably wrote the power of that. Hold on a minute. Where did you ever been front row at the fight for one cause he was saying I prefer the first wiser. I'm like okay well that's what everyone says that their car get front row tickets.

Speaker 2:          01:31:17       Okay. You all said, oh I'd rather be on the first advisor. You know, cause you ever got to get a sore neck looking up. I said, well guess what? When you from rob it's fucking cool. Okay. You can hear the punches, you can see the blood and the sweat from the first riser was good. I'd be doing commentary for the first prize. It was great. That's where all the celebrity, why was this? Look at this by Oh Jesus Christ. What? That was fine in my opinion. He said, fine, look, I wasn't wearing, he's wearing wrestling shoes. Yeah, the old head scissors classic. There is the uh, there a a video on flow grappling from a recent, a Jujitsu tournament where a guy got a guy in the is to put him to sleep,

Speaker 1:          01:32:00       right? Yeah. Right from his guard. Yeah. Well I wouldn't a couple of that shitty grappling tournaments. Well the heads is Yay. If you can squeeze hard enough, it wasn't against the best competition though. The guy might've been 55 or something. The deal legit though, if you get the knees on the right part of the neck and squeeze like a bitch, yeah, it hurts. And especially if you practice it, I feel like the head scissors or something like look and think about when you, when you're synching a Doris, right? Or when you, when you go under for a Doris and you clamp, we'll hold your hands and you pinch down. Some guys are expert at absolutely six squeeze, clamp down. If you just constantly drilled out all the time, you could fuck people up with that. Just get better at it. Just get better at it.

Speaker 1:          01:32:40       Like you could, you could, I don't want to be the guy going for a headset is in the UFC and it was that with his British wrestling. He let him do that. It's like the women go over their head and I've, you know, in women's Ndna you try a head and arm as a man, they're going to take you back to choke you out. Simple as that. But yet we'll run the run the main Liz Carmouche she was Ronda, his thing was always get that headlock and then hip toss, get a girl to the ground and then you know, get her in a normal, how does that work on women but not men? Next heads and necks are even smaller so they can show stand out of it easier. You know what I mean? Really works. I think what we saw on the Ronda Rousey fight with Liz Carmouche, Liz Carmouche took her back and almost choked her out.

Speaker 1:          01:33:27       Yeah. And if Liz was the lids of today, she probably would have choked her out showing how she just wasn't quite experienced enough at the time. I think the reason why you're seeing it more in women's MMA is because although the level is very high with like Valentina's shift Chenko and you own a unit j check and Cyborg, the level the champions is very high. There's still the lower levels absolutely near you could watch a guy on an undercard that's fighting on fight pass who's a fucking worldclass demon in the UFC. A man, the women you're still, there's, there's way less of them and the competition is strong. Yeah. I mean they haven't been doing it as long but I tell them pool isn't as big. You know, women aren't as interested in it. I was just about to say the percentage of men interested in pursuing martial arts and mixed martial arts as opposed to the percentage of women way lower.

Speaker 1:          01:34:18       I don't know what the percentage is of metal. If we said it's 50 just for the sake of the argument. Yeah, women it's going to be 5% if that, if that it's 5% probably men. If my wife said, Michael, I'm going to start training cause I want to be an MMA or fire. I said, pack your bags, get out. I'd say, shut the hell up. Made me a sandwich. What are you talking about? Come on, you're going to be an MMA fighter. I was the mother of your children get head kicked and just crazy. So my Thai boxing coach, actually you mentioned Vinny shoreman at the start. I used to be in business with Vinnie does Maurice. Very, very good friend of mine. He was my Thai boxing coach.

Speaker 2:          01:34:58       Back to Vinny shoreman. Shout out to dad's Maurice. And um, he's uh, his girlfriend, he was calling him and he's, he's getting, you know, the mother of his children. She was a Thai boxer, Cassie and Cassie, no disrespect, you know, but to be cornering your loved one that you were in a relationship and she got knocked out cold and a Thai boxing fan. I was like, wow. Does, how do you do that? And the mental strength to understand that this is a different relationship. That she's the student and the teacher and this is just the way it is. I mean, that takes a lot. I don't think I could do that. It's incredible. Well, it takes a different kind of woman to want to do that right there. That kind of woman you go. I mean, the worst thing I think you could ever do is take a woman who wants to fight and tell him no.

Speaker 2:          01:35:42       Yeah, sure. Yeah. Cause you're going to find a way, like if you're dating, don't go. Good luck with that. Good luck. Good luck with that one. You're going to get spinning, kick to the midsection. Shouldn't bottles. Okay. She's a fucking monster, isn't she? She's great. She's awesome. Quickest spinning back kicks I've ever seen. There's no fair. She's men. And, and I say this with a great set of respective to women's mixed martial arts and I respect everybody that applies themself and he's willing to get off the couch and make something of their lives. So, you know, I'm not being overly judgemental, but there isn't too many that I really get excited for and that really thoroughly enjoy watching. You know, because as we just said, the level of skill isn't quite there yet. You know, as I say, it's not nothing to do with genders.

Speaker 2:          01:36:27       Right. Why do I want to see a watered down product if I can see these guys doing it? It has such an extreme level. I don't really want to watch the smaller people that car hit as hard with lesser technique, but you know what I mean? As I say, nothing to do with gender, but um, but obviously there's a few exceptions to the rule and Shevchenko Yon j check Amanda Nunez. Cyborg. Yes, definitely. Amazing talent. There really is just a smaller pool. It's a smaller fight this weekend, one sensational [inaudible] and Valentino, that was a very, very high level fight. Oh, it really works. And what it really was. Yeah. Yeah. And Yon Jake, Jake impress me, you know, because he had a, I think it was a tough three rounds, fourth round. You know, she probably mad at the age, that fourth round, you know, so it's impressive that she, uh, we still had the fight in her soul late in the Florentine is just too strong to be too good a grappler and yeah.

Speaker 2:          01:37:19       Yeah. And bigger, physically bigger. Like you see Europe, we see it. You can see when their guests each other, the young Ghx very slim, very slender, and she's chef can cause muscle on her or serve Chanko was successful at one 35 you know, it's a big gap between 35 and one 15 were you on the reason young and JJ went up to one 25 is because she couldn't get a boat back at one 15 and I say that with the absolute great. So respect, you know, uh, when I was, a lot of it was the week it was crushing her and then she didn't have to cut weight for one 25 but the, on the flip side, you're fighting a bigger, stronger woman. Sure. Valentino, exactly. If she was fighting another Shoreway up to one 25 yeah, maybe things will be different, but that, that was always on paper. A bad matchup.

Speaker 3:          01:38:02       Yes. I agree. My opinion, yeah, it went down the way I thought it was going to go save here. A lot of fights, but the main event, man, the main event was one of those fights where I was like, I don't know. I don't know. [inaudible] I was like, if Max, uh, and if it goes to the ground and max gets caught up in something, I mean, or tag has got the nastiest fucking submissions in that.

Speaker 2:          01:38:24       Absolutely. Yeah. I mean, I did it now. I mean, as a sad, I favored Max. I thought Max was going to do it, but it as well, there's just something about Brian Arteaga. I mean, just, just looking at him, he looks like a fucking killer. You know what I mean? And he'd say clear the division. He's calm. He has that presence, you know? I don't know. He has it. He has just going to look on his face that it wants to snap your neck off.

Speaker 3:          01:38:45       He's going to learn. He's going to learn from that fire. Of course. A Lot, a lot going on in that fight to learn from it. Yeah. In terms of his movement, in terms of just trying to handle Max's barrage and it's the pressure that he puts on you.

Speaker 2:          01:38:57       Well, he's only young, so that should be a massive motivator for him because when you go away and you win fires, he's great. There's no better feeling than winning fights. And I'm telling you this like you don't know, but you know this. But you know when you went in fights, he's great and you go and you don't really change anything because everything's going good. You know, but when you lose, then you're like, okay shit, I don't want to make a habit of this was the undefeated, I think it was undefeated. That was his first loss. So now he's going to say, okay, what can I do to it to ensure that I don't start getting more losses? You know, he wants to be the champion. Like my first loss was to Rashad Evans and then I remember on the day, um, Dave, the way in, he was a sat in the sauna killing himself during his usual thing and the team that I was with that shall remain nameless back then, they'll want it to eat Chinese food.

Speaker 2:          01:39:45       So I was like trying to order the most healthiest thing in the Chinese restaurant that I could. So I was eat eating noodles and drinking fucking sprite, you know, on the day of the Wayne, she's as crazy cause cause when I was at two oh five, I didn't cook way at all, you know, so I remember, um, you know, and I still weighed in another time when I fought hell of a synthetic world back in the day, it was my first fight at Manchester and a, I was getting tickets for everybody, you know, loving it, really loving the attendees were first time, you know what I mean? So get your tickets, talking about a fucking pain in the ass. It was a lot of tickets is a pain in the ass. Oh my God. Because you've got to get the money off the people, then you've got to get the ticket, then you've got to do the transaction.

Speaker 2:          01:40:21       This is day of the fight. You know what I mean? I remember being on my knees there, the fight, we've hundreds of tickets and cash everyone. I'm like, Oh my God, why did I do this? Oh no, sorry. The day, the way in part of me anyway. And I was so stressed out with it and I drove home. I fell asleep in my own bed now before the night, before the night before the way, pardon me. And I'm driving home and uh, I was so stressed out and I was hungry. I hadn't eaten all day because I forgot I was too stressed. And as I'm driving along the freeway, I don't really eat burger king, but I saw the sign for Burger King and I was starving. I thought fuck it. So I pull off and I get a triple whopper with cheese and bacon fries and a large coke. And I'm sitting there and you know the, the noise that it makes when you get to the bottom,

Speaker 7:          01:41:04       that sound as asthma. Oh what am I doing? Holy Shit. Cause I'm so stressed out with a God damn tickets I'd forgot all about it is all that crap.

Speaker 2:          01:41:16       So before did I just stepped on the scale? No problem. I'm with Rashad Evans. Same thing. I just stepped on the scale. So after that I was like, okay, what can I change? Well, I'm not making the sacrifices I could be, you know, to be as successful as possible. So that was, you know, moved out of the middle away and Ortega, you know, he's not going to drop weight. He does not need to, but he doesn't need to. You can work on some things, you know, you can learn simple as that.

Speaker 3:          01:41:38       Yeah. He most certainly can. I mean, uh, he's uh, he's got tremendous Jujitsu and his boxing is very good as well. But you know, when you experienced that kind of a fighter, when you experienced that kind of a champion, like Max Holloway, you, you understand that there's, there's areas where you're exposed, there's areas where you have holes and you have areas where you can't compete with him. And as successfully as you have been with previous fighters. So it's a learning experience and I'm sure he'll be better because of it. Yeah,

Speaker 2:          01:42:05       I would say because of the third round then. Yeah. You know, he's surely made it competitive in the third round and landed a couple of good shots. Cause I was going to say, you know, in some circumstances it doesn't matter. You go where work your ass off, you're never going to beat that guy. Right. You know what I mean? All the work, all the culture. You spend all the money and dedicate your fucking life. God live in a monastery in fucking China. Do whatever you want. You're never going to be that guy. But in the third round he kept him on as he landed some good shots. So I wouldn't say that's necessarily applicable. Um, you know, but it certainly got to do some work. Yeah. He's in the striking department. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          01:42:40       Yeah. And the striking department and I'm sure in the wrestling department as well. Sure. You know, he got him down briefly, but Max did a fantastic job of a stuffing. It getting back up to his feet, you know, a retaining, you know.

Speaker 2:          01:42:52       Yeah, for sure. I mean, I don't want to speak out of turn. Um, I did find it somewhat curious. Is it Hannah grace here? Yes. Hannah. Grace, you've given him the, the, the, the, the, the boxing advice in the corner. Yeah, I find that somewhat curious. Yeah. You know, when I, when I had my FYS Jason Parillo off the fire was on the fee, he was given the instruction. When the fire hit the floor, Brady frank took over, you know, and if there was elements, you know, they knew their elements in the corner, you know, he'd say his bit, boom, you go, you know, no disrespect to had a grace. He's done amazing things. You've been a tag of by the, by everything I see online, you know, congratulations. You know, but when you get now struck, I don't really want advice from his shit to coach. Right. All right.

Speaker 3:          01:43:34       No, that's a good point. It's a very good point. You know, um, it's, it's interesting. Like you, you had a great situation with Jason Parillo and the other coaches that you worked with, and sometimes a young fighter needs like a mastermind, right? Matt Hume or a for Rasa. Someone who could put it all together for you at John Crouch. You know what I mean?

Speaker 2:          01:43:55       Yeah, absolutely. And I was also going to say, and this is probably well by all accounts, it is what Henry is to always take a mentor as well. He does see my, he's as mentor. So for that, you know, maybe I shouldn't have quiet set it in the words that I did use, you know what I mean to say is that that is his mentor, his father figure, whatever it is. So there's a reason why he is there, but for sure bring on an expert in those areas of specialist.

Speaker 3:          01:44:20       Yeah, yeah. It's uh, you know, so it's a crazy world. The world of fights

Speaker 2:          01:44:26       in mixed martial arts, you know what I mean? As I said, there's a lot of, there's a lot of fakes.

Speaker 3:          01:44:29       Well, there's a lot of that and there's a lot of, it works good now, but then when you find a world class fighter, you realize why, why there was holes in that.

Speaker 2:          01:44:38       Yeah. That you'll find out pretty quick. You know, when you've got a coach, there's never, now you don't have to have real life combat experience to be a good coach. But it helps. It certainly helps. It. It helps the fighter really trust the advice that they're giving you. Yeah. For a fire to be standing there and telling you throw combinations. Have you ever been in there? You have experienced what it's like to have another guy trying to take your head off every time and you're, and you're going to talk shit to me. Did you see the Mike Perry video now planning my Peri Peri is great video or did he do

Speaker 3:          01:45:09       bill telling him that like, like when you're fighting and the coach is like, go, go, go, go, go. He's like,

Speaker 2:          01:45:15       I'm not trying to get fucking hit right now. Yeah, exactly. That's what is video too. I know

Speaker 3:          01:45:19       Mike, you know he's an intense guy and he's talking about, and he's like, we're faking, we're faking, were fainting. We're trying to make our way in, but no one wants to make a move because no one wants to get clipped first.

Speaker 2:          01:45:28       Yeah. Well, I remember, you know, I mean when I fought Rashad Evans, it wasn't the most action packed fight. And when I watched it back I was like, fuck, why did I just go for it a little bit more? And then I'm like, oh cause I remember, cause every time we took a step forward, built the wind of the punches nearly taking my head off when you sit, even myself, when you sit and watch and go, wow, I do more. But then you take yourself back to when you were in there and you know, ah yeah, that was why that was why, you know,

Speaker 3:          01:45:53       to such a tricky situation and the fight game evolves, the styles evolve in the way guys pursue fights, evolves. It's just, it's really interesting to watch know you see a guy like mighty mouse who does things different than anybody else. And you go, oh well look at how this motherfucker does it. You know what I mean? No, for sure. And it's, it's a, it's a sport where, you mean, you were incredibly fortunate in that, um, you got to not just be there when it was exploding, but you've got to got to be a part of the explosion. Sure. You know,

Speaker 2:          01:46:25       I mean, that's not, I absolutely, I made

Speaker 3:          01:46:30       six. You were, you were in the ultimate fighter.

Speaker 2:          01:46:32       Yeah. 2005. I feel like it was December, 2005. Yeah. Yeah. Crazy, right? Crazy man. It really was. It really was. It was good times when it was just popping. Oh yeah. I remember when the ultimate fighter first came out. I know it was on Bravo TV in England. Oh, Sam's here. And I said to my wife, I was like, check this out. And she's like, I can't watch it. I'm like, why is it because if you are on there, you'd win the things. Right. I don't want to watch it. It's not fair, Michael. You should be on there. And then Lo and behold, you know, about six months later, they were looking for two English men. And, uh, we went down to Earl's court for auditions. And the great thing was, at that time I was 10 and now I was the cage rage champion, cage warriors champion in FX three champion as well as the British headwear kickboxing champion as well. And every 100 that was auditioning for the light everywhere. I'd knocked them all out in the first round. Of course, you know, to, to my style. I Made, you know, Dana fully aware of that. But uh, yeah, it was crazy, man. I couldn't believe it. You know, it was nuts. I'd never been to America. Next minute I'm on some fucking we TV show and a manager in Las Vegas, you know, it was, it was a great time. It was, it really was.

Speaker 3:          01:47:36       What was it like being separated from your family for six weeks and doing that show? And

Speaker 2:          01:47:40       very hard, very difficult. Of course. But I was there for a reason, you know, so I was the greater good, you know, I said, yeah, of course it sucks. It sucks being away. Sucks, missing time, missing birthdays, all that type of stuff. But if you're doing it for a reason, then, then you know, he's gotta be mature about it. My wife always was, the kids understand, you know? Yeah. It's not good being away from home, but, uh, I'm working on something here and I just set us up. Come on, do me a favor. Understand, you know, well, it worked out. Yeah. They were always great, you know. Yeah. It worked out and then it did not. No regrets. I mean, maybe a few, maybe a few.

Speaker 3:          01:48:17       Yeah. But you know what, man, there's no way to not have him. Yeah. I mean there's no perfect path. That's one of the crazy things about fighting zig when you should a zag. Do you get hit? That's it. There's no, that's part of the game.

Speaker 2:          01:48:29       That really is the sport. You know, it's, uh, it's such a cliche thing to say so many ways to win and lose, but there really is, you know, and as you say, Zig when you should have zagged, the smaller gloves, you know, the take downs, that's the problem. When you find a restless, such a pain in the ass, you know, cause I'm a better strike is the most of these west is. But when they tried to take you down, it changes everything because you go out and you're like, okay this motherfuckers just try to take me down. That's all he's trying to do. So I can stand here and I'm going to wait for him to shoot and then I'm going to stuff his take down because I'm waiting for a take down. I'm not thinking about the hands and Douche. Then you get caught with a shot, you know like what the fuck he supposed to be gone for a take down, not punching me in the face. And then all of a sudden you're striking is terrible because you're totally thrown off by the wrestling. So it, it, it's, it's a very, very difficult spoil. It really is.

Speaker 3:          01:49:16       Another one of your most impressive victories was the second fight with Dan Henderson cause you got hit with some fucking oh yeah. Arms in that fight. But you refuse to go out. Yeah. You refuse to be stomped in that fight.

Speaker 2:          01:49:29       Yeah. You know what I mean?

Speaker 3:          01:49:31       That was a, that was a display of willpower and a lot of ways because I remember watching those, those big shots from Henderson land and I mean they were on the edge. I mean, you were on the edge going out.

Speaker 2:          01:49:43       Oh, for sure. Absolutely. I mean, I remember he hit me, I went down, it was swarming on me, hit me with some elbows, but I remember I was always fine, but I was like, Holy Shit. You know, that was what hit me there. And then I managed to get myself back to mafia and had blood pouring down my face and whatnot. Of course, second round, the same thing happened and he had two big mamas in the file too. Big shots. But they were big moments. But you don't win a 25 minute five by London, two shots, you know. But they were big shots. Fair play to him. But uh, you know, I refuse to quit there because, you know, obviously going into that fight, I talked to me the shit like always, and you can lie to everybody. You can lie to the media. You can lie to the press, you can lie to your family.

Speaker 2:          01:50:26       Lighty coaches was not necessarily lies, but you can ooze bravado and this and that. But you can't lie to yourself. You know, when you let him bed at night and your head's on the cushion, you know, can't bullshit yourself, you know, and day of the fight because the fire was at six in the morning. They're the fight. I'm let them my bed trying to just have a nap cause it was going to be a long night obviously. And uh, I couldn't sleep and all I was thinking human nature. Last time I stepped into an octagon with this guy, I was fucking out cold for a long time. My brain was scrambled eggs for a long time after that fight. And, uh, as I say, you can lie to everybody else, but now the fight was getting close and it's in my hometown and it's my first title defense and all this.

Speaker 2:          01:51:08       I'm like, Shit, Shit. I know I'm better than this guy, but fuck, last time, last time it didn't end well. So, uh, I was, uh, getting a little worked up and I remember I was at the arena and I was kind of, you know, being a little edgy, a little snappy with people and there's not need for it. And then I just stopped over. I started laughing and I said, what's you laughing at? I said, well, what's the worst it's going to happen if I lose, what's the word I'm going to lose a fight? It's happened before, so why am I stressing myself out of it? And I just started laughing after that. It was fine, but uh, yeah, yeah, no, it was, uh, I definitely, uh, had a sour face the next day after that one for sure. Yeah. But you, you know, you got through the fire.

Speaker 2:          01:51:53       Yeah, no I did and I felt great. The only problem was in the fifth round because this cheekbone, it's swollen. It was on my good side. It's shad, the cheekbone on the, on my good side and a, it swelled up so much I could hardly see out of that eye, this size Fox as well. So in the fifth round, I'm like trying to like get a certain angle where I could even see the, do you know what I mean? It was a nightmare, you know? But uh, yeah. Got The job done unfortunately. Is there anything that like is on the horizon in terms of like medical science that you're looking at in terms of being able to fix your eyes? Eh, not that I know of. I spoke to doctors about it, you know, cause I, I was uh, yeah, I was always curious what, what, what, uh, what could be done.

Speaker 2:          01:52:40       But I don't think in my lifetime there is, but the reason I retired was that the gas, Dylan five, because I was clear to fi and the doctors were always like, we don't really advise it, but you are cleared. You've passed the test just by the skin of your teeth. And for me that was all well and good. You gotta do your medical. The most stressful part of all of that was when you, you got to got to do a full training. Come now, then fly somewhere and you're going to see another doctor, a commission, docs read the way it right. And you don't know what this doctor is going to be like. You don't know if he knows anything about eyes. You don't know if he wants to be a hero. You don't know if he wants to make fucking press the guy that pulled the main event.

Speaker 2:          01:53:18       Do you know what I mean? Very, very stressful time. So for me, the fight was always the easy part. The hard part was just fucking making it to the octagon and I got to the Wayne's and I get cleared up. The feeling was like, okay, we're good. The fights aren't, because I didn't know the fire was on until I got past the commission. Doctor. How many different fights did you have to go through like that? About 12 something like that. Fights with, I'm not sure as as 12 something like that. Oh Damn Belcher. Kang Lee Belcher. Tim Kennedy. Kung Lou Rockhold CB tells lies. And this is silver. Luke Rockhold, Dan Henderson, GSP gasoline. 11 1111 yeah. Yeah. So that was stressful. And then obviously, you know, I lost the belt and I would in my mind, every tired, you know, I just hadn't made it formal yet. And, uh, I was driving up for lunch with my wife and my in laws, they were in town and we heard on the Sirius Xm fight club dilute Thomas show.

Speaker 2:          01:54:18       He was talking about, and this is Silva silver testing, positive for steroids and they needed a replacement. And I said, should I do it? And they were like, what are you talking about? So I text Dana right then and there, and then a week later I'm on a plane to Shanghai, no training, I'd done anything. I'm like, well, I mean, I trained as soon as I found out about that, you know, I mean, I, you know, I aspire it a few times and then got on a plane and went out there and, uh, yeah, you know, God bless him. He got me. But then after the fight, because you know, as I said, you know, I was cleared to fight, but the doctors always said, we don't recommend it because if anything happens to you, good eye, you're going to, you're going to be in a real problem.

Speaker 2:          01:54:56       And I was like, well, so many fighters in the UFC have long careers and they don't get detached witness. Okay. It's, it's, it's a very, not rare, but it's pretty rare. Pretty read or hear about it too much when I'm thinking, okay, well the strike, the lightenings already struck. Okay, lightening isn't going to strike twice. You know what I mean? I'm not that fucking unlucky anyway. So we have the gas in them fight and then we go to an after party in Shanghai. I mean some club and a, I'm in the club and every time I look that way and he still does it to this day, every time I look that way, like a bolt of lightening, like I'm slouching around when you do that. Yeah. Work. What do you see? Was it art? Someone's taking lasher yeah. Yeah. And I was in this club and every time I'm looking at it's doing that and, and I start freaking out, cause I know you, I've got history of, of symptoms with eye problems and whatever.

Speaker 2:          01:55:46       And I start telling myself, I don't believe this. I've got a detached retina in my good eye and I'm, I'm freaking out. And, uh, I didn't want to be in a nightclub around a bunch of fucking dickheads anyway or drinking. I hate nightclubs. So, um, I said I'm just going to go to the toilet and a restroom. And, uh, that was it. I was leaving, you know, but I just wanted to be by myself and I left there and shed a little tear in the taxi. I didn't want to be sat in the fucking nightclub crying because if people see me crying, they're gonna blow. He's crying. Cause bless him, he lost a fight to gas. Dillon was like, no, I'm not crying cause I lost a fight to gas them crying because I might be going fucking blind here. You know what I mean?

Speaker 2:          01:56:21       So, uh, so I jump in a taxi, I got back to my hotel and then a layer on Perillo and a few guys came back, see if I was okay and you know, whatever. We just carried on talking and having a few drinks at the room and forgot all about it. And uh, you know, I'll turn into a bit of a messy one in Shanghai, forgot all about my eye and the next thing I'm on a plane flying home and I'd forgotten all about it. I fall asleep on the plane. I wake up halfway home problem flying over the Pacific somewhere, the planes pitch black and then albums, he starts doing it again. I'm like, Shit, because I've forgotten all about it. So trying to get a Wifi on the plane, trying to find something about it, trying to Google it, what it could be and all the rest of it.

Speaker 2:          01:57:03       And the wife, I would at work and I'm going off on him trying to beg the air hostess, you know, please, please do I need to get a Wifi? I need, I have to. I didn't tell her why. And she said, nice, it's down right now. And I'm like, Oh fuck. Anyway, so our land there, call my eye doctor straight away. I tell him, I said, listen, I think I've got a detached retina and her good eye. Why'd he say that? Tell them the stories is don't worry, don't worry. You know, he'd be okay. So I go see an eye doctor the next day. And uh, he says, well, I told him the issue and he says, why do you say that? And I tell him why. I said, so do you think it's a detached retina? And he says, well, it certainly sounds like one. I'm like, fuck me.

Speaker 2:          01:57:39       He says, okay, we're going to put some drops in your eyes. Everything's going to go blurry. And I only see a tiny bit out this eye. And I'm like, ah, I made, I make stupid joggers. My defense mechanism on like, oh, I guess a better get used to this view way, Huh? And the doctor's like, well, we don't know that just yet. And I'm like, fuck me. Do you know that's not the answer I was expecting anyway. Turns out, didn't have a detached retina. I had a partial vitreous detachment. So you have, you, you're a cornea here, you retina at the back and in between what's called bitchy fluid, millions of fibers connect to the retina to send a message. I think if I'm getting it wrong, I'm sorry, doctors. And in your sixties that just slides off the retina, detaches naturally. Maybe you 60, 70, who knows?

Speaker 2:          01:58:24       But as you get older, through old age, it just slides off. It can detach due to trauma. So that's what happened to me. Uh, so it, it, it, but it had partially detached. So, but the problem was when these fibers are polling, they can cause the retina to tear. So, uh, they were, they were like, well, we need to keep an eye on this and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. So anyway, long story short, after that, I thought, fuck this. Yeah, they ain't worth it. And if they've done anything to the isense no, and there's nothing to be done. There's nothing that be done. Nothing can be done now. Yeah. And, and, and they're fine with it. They're happy with it. It, it's okay. But it, but it was, for me it was, it was, uh, you know, a step too far. I pushed it as far as I, you know, I was willing to push.

Speaker 2:          01:59:08       In fact, I'm a liar. I was at a spouse to fight with shard in London earlier this year, but, uh, we couldn't agree on the deal terms with the UFC fight. Never materialized. And I was flying up to New York to do my podcasts. We've Louis and, uh, on the plane I'm watching this movie called the journeyman and Paddy Considine. It's about a boxer. He's a world champion at the end of it, it wins a fight and then he has severe brain damage and it's a very, very sad movie. She checked it out. It's really, really powerful. Very, very good. Anyway, I watched that in a fudge. That's it. That was it. So I'm going to have the plane. We started our podcast. I said boom. I wouldn't even ask him. What's it good for you? I, it was the best decision I ever made. You know, I've been very, very happy ever since.

Speaker 3:          01:59:56       Yeah. You, I mean, you have other options. I mean, you had a long, great career. You have options.

Speaker 2:          02:00:02       Yeah. I mean, as I say, no regrets, you know, I mean, um, it, it was a wonderful ride. I, I loved it. I, I never thought a young kid doing martial arts and, and you know, a guy that liked to have a scrap when he was a kid could take it this far. And that's a beautiful thing about the UFC these days. You know, if you're up that certain mindset, that certain character you like a bit of rough and tumble, you don't mind getting a punch in the face here and there and you're willing to go for it. You can make your living, you can make it, you know, when I was younger, I used to do a lot of professional kickboxing, but I had never looked at it as a career because it wasn't back then. But now it's great. You know, it really is a career viable career.

Speaker 3:          02:00:40       Well, especially for a guy like you who's a good talker, who understands how to break fights down and you can make this transition. It's one of the things that are really like about the UFC and they've allowed these fighters, like, you know, I do a lot of commentary now with Paul Felder and Daniel Cormier, Dominick Cruz, and they've given these guys, he's,

Speaker 2:          02:00:59       Oh yeah, it's great. Yeah, as I was saying before, but that was one of the things that scared me as well as a kid because your gyms all over the world and you see amazing talent everywhere. Amazing talent. And you know, the, the, the, the sleeping in the cars or the sleeping on a couch. It's someone's friends house, you know, and, and they're struggling to pay the bills and the jab and a shitty beat up piece of Shit, you know? And it's a shame. And I see them and in my heart goes out to them and for whatever reason, they don't get the breaks. They'd all look right. The cop put it together and find out the nerves get the better of them. Who knows what it is. But they just don't it. You know what, I'm fine. Such a cruel, vicious sport. It really is.

Speaker 2:          02:01:43       So that's why when people, I get asked all the time, do you want your son to do it? I might. Well, no, not really the way icees I fall so he doesn't have to, but if he wants to use the number for frank wrestler in, uh, in California, he's seen the videos, he's a CEO. He's a beast. If he wanted to, of course I support it. My father supported me ridiculously. If it wasn't for my father, I wouldn't be here either. Um, but I wouldn't wish it on him. I would've wished to life of a fire on anybody because it's so unpredictable and just because you're good and just cause you can take a punch and just cause you're, you're an animal in there doesn't mean you're going to be a success. You know what I tell you got to be the perfect storm. What I tell young fighters is, uh, you know, when they say, Oh, I'm, I'm thinking about trying MMA, I go, don't do it.

Speaker 2:          02:02:25       Yeah. If you're thinking about it, don't do it. If you tell me you're obsessed with it and you want to be a world champion, then I say go ahead. Sure, absolutely. Yeah. If you're not obsessed, there's some motherfuckers out there that, oh yeah, they're living at 24, seven all day long. They're there and this is a thing. Um, you know, you see a lot of young fighters now, they're obsessed with the image and you know, you know what I mean? Cause it's on TV. It's cool and it's got a lot of popularity now, so a lot of people want to do it. As I said, this pretenders in coaches, it's pretenders in fires as well. A lot of people, you know, they want to be in, are they want to be Connor Mcgregor, they want to be choked with Ella, whatever, and they're all fucking way and tap out and we're having Mohawks and stuff.

Speaker 2:          02:03:03       Do you know what I mean? And they're talking about, or for this camp I'm going to bring in this guy fucking camp. You don't have training camps at the start of your career, right at the start, he clear you. When you train Monday to Friday, you have a fire at the weekend if you, when you're back in the gym fucking Monday. You know what I mean? You fight every few weeks. You know, every, you know, when I was starting, and I think I had six fires in the first year, probably five kickboxing fights. You're trying to build momentum. You're not doing camps right. I don't want to hear any young fire saying to me for this camp, I'm focusing on my wrestling. He's like, shut the fuck up. You've had two amateur fights. You're not doing the trading category. Do Training. That's it. You know, for sure. Well, listen, Mike, uh, thanks for doing this, man.

Speaker 2:          02:03:45       I'm going to flash it and we could do it again anytime you learn. Yeah, no, I don't tell everybody about your podcast with Louis Gomez. She, yeah. To Louis.
