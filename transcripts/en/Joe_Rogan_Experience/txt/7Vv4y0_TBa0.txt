Speaker 1:          00:00:00       Thanks for having me. Thanks for being here. Appreciate it.

Speaker 1:          00:00:07       Dot, dot, dot, dot. The opinions you're about to hear it. Do you not represent national geographic or anybody other than us? That's it. And even us, we're not sure of it. We're not committed to these, these statements. Adam, welcome. Thanks Jack. Thanks fucker. Right in front of your face there. Thanks for having me, Jeff. Cliche. Appreciate it, man. Dude, you live a life of adventure. This is a. I was so excited when you contacted me and I went to your instagram page and saw the photos and saw the places you've been and looked you up, man. He live in a crazy life. I do a bit of traveling, that's for sure. A few frequent flyer miles, man. I mean so much adventure. So many different places and so much cool shit you've seen. Like what? How did you get into this? I kind of grew up doing it.

Speaker 1:          00:00:51       Tell you the truth. I had a family. He made a nature documentaries, so as a family unit, that's what we did for a living and so I was traveling from. Well, the moment I could walk basically. Wow. That is cool. What is your. Your dad is like a filmmaker or something? Yeah, I your mom. I should say your mom or your dad? I'm so solid family unit sort of thing. What about, I guess, how do you explain that in a nutshell? He kind of, the Australian Jacques Cousteau, maybe the Australian version of that. Maybe he started off as a shock content back in the sixties, so it was actually putting shocks and putting that. I'm filming it, putting it on TV with Leonard Nimoy was narrating spock was actually narrating them back in. He'll never be anything but sparked. I know, I know. I love that place.

Speaker 1:          00:01:40       You get fucked man. You have a role too. Good. Um, and then he turned conservationist, you know, after probably bid sixties or something. So he was a hunter. So he was going out and killing sharks and then he, what, what made him sort of shift into conservation? I think it was just a realization of just, yeah, what a, what a waste, you know, killing shocks. And also, I think after you spend enough time with sharks in the water, you realize they're not dangerous at all. These things. A magnificent creatures. They're not under most circumstances. I mean they're obviously, they do kill. They get hungry occasionally. Yeah. I mean the problem is really we look like seals on a surf board, right? Then that's a real problem. It's taking identity a nine times out of 10 mistaken identity. And the only way they can figure out what you are is by coming up and taking a little bite and surf board and wetsuit.

Speaker 1:          00:02:28       But that one little box can sometimes be fate a killer. But it's very rare. It's very rare to get eaten by a shark. Yeah. Fairly rare. Not Rare enough. Once again, I mean, I should just clarify. I'm not in favor of killing sharks. I'm not interested in eradicating them from the ocean, but they scare the shit out of me, man. I was uh, in California, in California now, but it was like a couple years ago, some guy, this is my biggest fear. Some guy was swimming with a bunch of people that were training for a triathlon and it was off the coast of San Diego and he was bitten in half in front of everybody.

Speaker 1:          00:03:10       You know, I mean it does go down, but perspective kill a hundred or 100 million sharks a year. Well now you and I, so probably shouldn't we as humanity? Yes. Humanity kills 100 million in the suit. We killed. They killed maybe eight to 10 of us. I think it's less than that. I think it's like five. Yeah, it depends what you get the statistics from accounting because I mean most Fatah fatalities and it comes to shock attacks. Actually. The Zambezi, the bullshit because in Africa don't have great records. Um, but I would say yeah, eight to 10 per year. The crazy thing about bull sharks is they can live in freshwater, like deep, deep, deep in freshwater rivers. They're kind of blind. They can only see about six inches in front of their face. So they like rivers and dirty kind of water. I spent two years swimming everyday with a, Oh, it's about three meters.

Speaker 1:          00:04:01       Bull shock in captivity as soon as you stood up the water, she would come ride. And she loved it when it was murky because that's when she had the advantage over the other animals. Oh, interesting. Well, you know, the basis for the movie jaws was actually a freshwater shark attack. It was baffling to people. They had no idea that sharks at the time would even exist in fresh water, but it was in New Jersey and these people are in a river and I think two people were killed inside of a short period of time by bull sharks that it's swim, swim, swim, swim, swim, sound, right, swim up river and uh, in fresh water. So these people were at our freshwater beach by the river and they get killed. Everyone's scared of the great white, you know, the big shock. But if you talk about the amount of a tax bill shock is Fafa hm.

Speaker 1:          00:04:53       That's interesting. And then you think it's because they're young, they don't see. Well, so it's a mistaken identity thing. Well, it's, once again, they, they, they see you using the electrical, uh, receptive. So that I can think of, see hot beating basically, but it doesn't know what you are and it's got really bad vision. So the only way you can figure out what you are and whether your edible is to come and take a little bite and you know, that little block sometimes can be fatal. Yeah. I saw something last night. I think it's got to be bullshit. I wish I could remember the name of it, but it was a camouflage suit that you could wear while hunting that does not give out the electrical signal. So it was like a, it was close. It was somehow or another. The, these clothes keep an electrical signal from like animals from seeing this electrical signal. I, it sounded like horseshit though. Well I mean there is some science that if you have a faraday cage suit. So what does it live in a Faraday cage? Totally. The middle. Basically woven. That stops a electrical stuff. Jamie, is that real make significant human significantly less detectable by animals? No, it would. It would sense for sure with

Speaker 2:          00:05:58       animals that have the electrical impulse receptors like sharks do. Huh? Well, sharks have that line on their body, right? That's what it is. Well, a all fish have a line going, lateral line going down in that detects the, you know, electrical impulses, but sharks have on the nose. Um, it's a really hard word to pronounce them. Look on trying, but they have this electrical receptor on the front of their nose. And so when a shark sees you, it can actually see your heart beating. And so say you're swimming with sharks and someone else next to you and you've been, um, you've never been. You've been swimming with sharks before. You pretty calm. So your heart's going, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. Person next to you and never been swimming with sharks before. Freaking out their hearts going, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

Speaker 2:          00:06:39       A million miles an hour that shark's gonna swim up and go lunch person with a faster happy because they're stressed out, they're going to be easier to catch. Nature does not like bitches. That's what it is. Panic like a bitch. Nature's like [inaudible]. It's true. If you panic when you're in with sharks, they'll come right up to you. They want to check your animals, right? You ever seen people that just freak out around dogs and dogs start barking at them and then another person come up with that dog. Hey Buddy, what's going on? You all right? You know? Yeah. Yeah. So your dad was a shark hunter. And when he was hunting these sharks, was he doing it for food? Were they eating the sharks? This was, I mean, you gotta remember this is back in the day, you know, this is kind of, and c's sixties, early sixties. And back then it was, he was filming people killing, you know, 20, 30 shocks, uh, at a time.

Speaker 2:          00:07:25       And it was just a, was the first underwater documentaries out there sort of showing that world. And they were using explosive headset, like a spear gun with a bullet 300, three on the end of it. Oh Wow. And they were shooting them that way. But, uh, you know, I look at those videos now and some of the species that we're killing it just completely harmless and it's just. And I guess it eventually to get to that point where they turned around and went, oh, hang on, this is bad, and so use that fame or that desire for this underwater footage and then, and then sort of take a conservation angle to it instead. So there were, they initially doing it to eradicate dangerous animals. Is that whether we're doing it, I guess there's that aspect of that to tell the truth. I think it was just good tv.

Speaker 2:          00:08:05       Oh, okay. So it was just let's go shoot some shit and put it on television and here's sharks. And everyone's scared of them, you know, that's, it was quite a natural thing back then to go, you're scared of something could kill it. And so your dad, while you were young, became a conservationist and then started taking you all around the world. Yeah. So we made these kinds of, one our nature documentaries. Um, they were shown in Australia on channel seven over here, Disney channel pick them up. Um, this trend around the world and uh, mainly underwater kind of adventure. I look back now and I actually think it's kind of reality TV to the truth because it's a, it's a documentary of a family going on an adventure and learning some stuff and seeing some cool stuff on the way. Wow. So this has been your life all along? Yeah. Wow, that's cool man. And so how'd you get involved with nationally?

Speaker 1:          00:08:56       You're a national geographic expedition leader. I worked for a company called Linblad expeditions, National Geographic. So it's a partnership between Lindblad expeditions at National Geographic and we've got a fleet of 10 vessels and we take people to the remotest places on it basically. And so they graciously give me a $100,000,000 ship and 100 people on it and a kind of a, you start here and you end here two weeks later and yeah, go for an adventure. Go see what you can file. Dad Is fucking bad. It's good fun. It's, you know, it's a lot of work. I don't like anything you get paid for this work to it, but um, yeah, the perks are just phenomenal. The perks are made $100, million dollar vessel. Yeah. Wow, it's a nice ship. It's a beautiful ship, national geographic or right. It's one of the best exhibition ships floating at this point in time.

Speaker 1:          00:09:47       And so like when you go on these ships, like what are the ultimate goals are to collect samples to view things, to take photographs to try to view rare species, bit of everything really. Uh, so we have scientists on board doing some research and stuff like that. Um, but we're also taking tourists, you know, we're taking people who are paying a considerable amount of money. I can go to those. I can go on a tour, official can come down to Antarctica with me. Woo. It's too cold. I want to go somewhere. Cool. And tactic is just got back from Costa Rica where they invite me to that. That's bad ass. I have to point out, I do it. My friend down, they've, Conrad said, make sure you invite joe down here. Is that your boat? Um, yeah. National Geographic or Ryan, you're on a cruise ship. It's not a cruise ship.

Speaker 1:          00:10:28       We have to be very specific about this. It's just say it's not a cruise ship. That's a fucking cruise ship. There's. There's a difference between expedition and cruising. Okay, so a cruise ship goes to, goes to port, deport you, you stop in at some town, you go after you explore the town for the day, you come back, you jump on the ship, he goes to the next destination. We don't go to towns. We go to places in between. We'd go to remote places. We've got 13 zodiacs onboard. So little small vessels to live in like a gangster on this thing. Look at this. Look, you got a hot tub. Come on. If you were a Russian oligarch, this is what I would expect. Look at these. What are these rock piles? Why do you have rocks? Um, yeah. They got removed about last week. They got removed because they were like, why do we have rocks that design 10 years old. Oh, okay. I see. So that's 2006.

Speaker 1:          00:11:24       It's not like we're talking about the twenties. Back then people didn't know any better. So you had these, these rocks are there just for. Looks like it's going to kill me if I talk about the rocks too long. But when a few weeks ago I saw them removing them so they're not been the rocks near there. It seems like a lot of weight to be carrying around just to look pretty. Come on. They're fiberglass rocks. Oh, they're fake rocks. You wouldn't put rocks on top of the ship. Get these photos. You guys partying. You know, it's like a Jay z video. Yeah. We have cocktail parties all the time. Boop, boop. And Wow. That is a bad ass boat to be touring around with. I spent new years dancing and partying on the ice in Antarctica. Whoa. Yeah. We have some good parties on there. We do.

Speaker 1:          00:12:05       Did you see any polar bears, polar bears in Antarctica? No, they're not in Antarctica. That's penguins. Penguins. Penguins on the sound winds in the north. Right. What, what kind of mammals do they have in Antarctica though? Oh, lots. I mean you've got all your different well spaces. So blue whales, fin whales say whales, humpback whales, minke whales and orcas. Um, and you know, a lot of different dolphins as well. And then of course you seals, you pin a pitts. I'm so elephant seals, a leopard suit, leopard seals. It seals a pretty cool. Those are the wildest man I remember when I saw that in March of the penguins movie and there's the first time I really found out about leopard seals or had seen them in like a, you know, high definition video form. I think maybe had seen a photograph of him before, but I didn't realize like what a majestic beasts they are, but a strange, almost like a fake animal.

Speaker 1:          00:12:57       It doesn't even look real. I think of him like a swimming jewel. Just this huge big Joel with massive team there. See the size of the teeth on them and they, they eat penguins and occasionally they chew on the back of Zodiacs as well. Zodiacs or those boats? We have probably about one a year. They ended up chewing on the back of the Zodiac. So because they're inflatable boat, why does they do that? To fuck with people? Probably just to fuck with people. Well, they're really weird because like, uh, there was one account that this photographer did a, it was several days where he spent filming a female leopard seal and she kept bringing him penguins to eat. And He. Have you heard of this? No, it was really fascinating because, uh, he was terrified, you know, this monstrous, enormous, predatory and have respect for them.

Speaker 1:          00:13:43       Oh yeah. They're huge. And she kept bringing him like dead penguins and like bringing it to my, come on, eat it, bitch. And he, she, I guess she felt bad for him or she was just trying to make friends with them or some sort of strange thing, like she's not in a position where she was famished where she didn't have. She had plenty of food so she wasn't looking to eat him, so she just decided to help him and try to feed him. It was very, very strange. I mean, the golden rule with sort of biology is don't put human emotions onto animals, but the closer you look at animals, more time you spend with the animals, you see these emotions, you see elements of culture. Also, some stuff going on. Um, yeah. We don't give him enough respect. We don't have to give humans now. Pull. Pull that up. This is it right here. How a leopard seal fed me penguins. It's really crazy. They have video footage of it too. I think if you press the video you'll see this. Uh, it's really crazy. The, this gigantic thing very well for the videos. Oh, okay. No worries. We don't have to show it, but um, folks can find it online. How a leopard seal. Is that the name of it? How a leopard seal fed me penguins. Amazing.

Speaker 2:          00:14:52       Amazing. And that's national geographic as well. That's your, your folks. Yeah. I recognize the over correction. Um, I kind of had a similar experience quite a few years ago. The Chew Gum. You ever heard of a Jugo? I've heard the word, but what is it during the Iranian family? Closest relative is manatee Chigong. It's kind of, you know, what a manatee is. So think of a manatee and then instead of like a beaver tail, put a dolphin tail on it. It's very small differences, but basically the same thing. And there was this one in Vanuatu and it lost its partner, um, and so every day what I do is catch turtles and bring it up to the beach and just push them up on the beach for the locals to eat. And so every day he would catch all the food the locals would need. Whoa. And then they befriended it and it was one of the juveniles in the world that you could actually swim and play with.

Speaker 2:          00:15:40       We did a documentary on it called the elusive mermaid. So I spent a quite a few weeks with this crazy credit. So strains like the personality diversity in these animals, like glue that. There it is. Whoa. That thing is crazy looking. Huge. Chabad 900 kilograms. It's D U, g o n g for anybody who's interested do gone to, gone to gung what a crazy looking animal. They are there. They're sometimes called the sea cow. They eat about 40 kilograms of seagrass a day. So wireless amount of food. That's insane. Sometimes called the elusive mermaid as well because at sale is back in the day. Used to mistake them for four nights. That's. Yeah, well you to be drinking a lot around that, that some people just get so desperado after long periods of time alone. Yeah, that's a wild wild animal though. It's strange that it would try to feed people and they have no idea what the motivation is.

Speaker 2:          00:16:34       Right. Um, once again, like if you anthropomorphize it just wanted interaction and one of their very close knit social structure. So when you have a group of them together, they're all together. They're very tactile, rubbing up against each other. So if it was in the middle of nowhere, there's no more geographies around it. Just decided to befriend the locals and kind of go that way. And there's lots of evidence with lots of animals doing that kind of friendships going on. And I've got a good story, if you, if you give me a second for the juggle. I nearly got killed budget go accidentally or tried to, tried to kill me. So I was filming this documentary elusive moment and so we've doing lots and lots of video and so I went to this one in Vanuatu and we're filming him and in the water playing with him and stuff like that. And he really liked females, didn't lock humans, humans love. So he would have some new data issues. He would chase and harassed miles basically. But back in those days I had long, long hair. Sounds like Jamie, Jamie, there's only.

Speaker 2:          00:17:39       So I had long hair so I kind of fooled, folded basically that he thought he was, it was all real casual with me. And then he would, um, he would grab your leg basically and he would on your wetsuit and clean his mouth on it and stuff like that. It's very tactile. Definitely grabbing your tongue in his mouth on your leg. All the bristles in front of his nose. He was just kind of cleaned that on your wet suit and stuff. He was just very tactile. And so one time he was doing that and he kind of went a little bit too far up my leg and he felt something. He went, I saw him, he looked at me and you're not female, you're male, and so he attacked me and so what he did is he, he grabbed me and then it's 900 kilogram animal or you got no hope, so he grabbed me, holding my arms against my chest, sort of thing.

Speaker 2:          00:18:22       Took me down to about five meters on the sandy bottom and just held me against the sandy bottom, trying to kill you. Well, I'm kicking and thrashing and I'm punching. I'm doing everything I can to get out of this bear hug from this Chigong and um, oh, I was down there for a minute and a half, two minutes and I'm excited to get them black coming in on the vision. And I remember clear as day just thinking death by Jugo didn't see that one coming. And then as soon as I gave up, you know, just kind of stopped fighting. He just let me go. It was just a game. It's just a game for him. He just wanted to prove dominance basically.

Speaker 3:          00:18:54       Whoa. And obviously he doesn't have any data as far as how many minutes a person can hold

Speaker 2:          00:19:01       breath for they die as soon as I stopped fighting and I just gave into, to the fact of death by Juggle, he let me go and I was wearing a wetsuit so it's kind of brought me back to the surface. But yeah, that was a near death experience for me. Wow. Wow. Jesus Christ. How terrifying and weird. So he felt like you tricked him? Um, well yeah, I told him. I mean he was, I was there and uh, there was a honeymoon couple there as well. It was a little resort where we call it resort and like shacks in the forest kind of thing. And I remember sitting there at dinner one time and now the new wife is going, oh, come on honey, jumped in the water with the Jew going to barneys please. Like no way. I'm not hopping in because he would just get attacked every time. So he really didn't like males.

Speaker 3:          00:19:46       That's so strange. I wonder what it is about you just long hair. Like how could they, how could they know? The cultural differences between the way humans were, their hair.

Speaker 2:          00:19:55       It's interesting point. I mean you could speculate and just go, well, he's just recognizing, you know, there's all hippie long hair people and non long hair people at. I don't know how the fuck would he know animals or we need more data.

Speaker 3:          00:20:08       Do you think that's what it is? Or the thing is you, with your long experience, lifelong experience being around animals that maybe you were more relaxed so he was cool with you. Yeah, that's definitely an aspect. Maybe Mandolin and they give off that energy of gone. Yeah. Yeah. I mean that definitely could be. No, you back off bitch and then he attacks him and the girls like don't hurt me. And he's like, I'm good. We're good. Maybe just like people to be submissive. Quite pop that right? Yeah. This, you know, the whole Alpha thing. It's going on everywhere. Yeah. It's a strange, strange looking animal man. That would be a weird animal to kill you. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:20:46       Yeah. I definitely didn't expect. I didn't expect to have a near death experience with juggle because you can barely get near these creatures. Normally a fleeting glimpse in the in the far distances. All you ever see these animals,

Speaker 3:          00:20:59       so is it when they're around resorts or something like that where they become accustomed to humans or around where there's large populations. Think

Speaker 2:          00:21:06       I have another time juggle this one. He died or left or something went wrong a few years back and I can't recall any other time geographies around the world except in captivity. I spent a bit of time with a tube in captivity at seaworld on the Gold Coast in Australia and yeah, there were a bit messed up actually like most animals in captivity.

Speaker 3:          00:21:27       Well, it's like that lion whisper cat. What's that dude's name? The handsome fella that's always on television. He's on the Jimmy Kimmel show all the time and he's always hanging around with lions. Yeah, and he sees the line is like Hulu would you do in the lion comes up to him. He gives him a hug. I'm like, okay, how the fuck did you ever work that out? Hey, what color? How do you work out that relationship? Is that the guy now? That's one of them. I think just probably more than one of these dudes obviously looks very 90, nine times out of 100.

Speaker 3:          00:21:59       That's the. Well apparently this is what, from what I understand, like lions and big cats, tigers and lions, when you have them as pets and you raise them as pets and you get used to them accustomed to them, there's so not intimidated by you. As long as they're well fed, you're pretty safe. They're most likely not gonna fuck you up, but they might fuck up other people who are around you and panic and don't know how to deal and they're like, why don't you bring this asshole here? I like hanging out with you and then they just whack them. You know?

Speaker 2:          00:22:30       I don't think we give enough respectful animals. I mean just you, your dog, your dog. Like some people and doesn't like other people and you should always listened to your dope.

Speaker 3:          00:22:38       Yeah, knows best will. You dog definitely knows when people are shady. You know when you have someone over and the dog started growling. Like what the fuck is going on man? You know, tap dogs know when people are comfortable, that's for sure. You know, I, I knew this lady, she had these crazy German shepherds man, but I've been around dogs my whole life and I was cool with them and she was surprised and she was like, you know, normally when these dogs around people that ground, they want to bite them. I'm like, why don't you fucking do something about your dogs then? Like everybody, like your dog thinks everybody's an asshole. Like that's probably on you. That's, that's bad training or

Speaker 2:          00:23:13       using positive reinforcement. If you use that technique you can get up to do anything. Any animal and will anyone.

Speaker 3:          00:23:21       I think she liked having aggressive dogs and she liked having people intimidated around her and her dogs, you know? But anyway, that's neither here nor there. You've been bitten by a box jellyfish? Yes. Dude, I've been stung. Technical bitten their face. You've been looked at and read. You've been read the riot act now they don't have my mouth. And you get. How'd you stung or do you, did

Speaker 2:          00:23:46       you not know it was there? Like what? I didn't know what to say. Obviously I was about 12 years old in Torres Strait, which is a bunch of islands in between Australia and Papa New Guinea and I was playing with a holly Patar Strait islanders, a local boys. I'm playing in the ocean, you know, just swimming around. And then I had one wraparound. My, my leg quadricep. Um, yeah, a lot of pain. I've heard a women who've had children have said that I've said that it's, it's far superior pain to childbirth that superior, like they enjoy a better or a far worse basically in orders of magnitude worse than childbirth is how they relate the pain. You'd probably have to talk to someone who's been stung by a bullet ant, which is supposed to be one of the most painful things. I wouldn't wonder who's got the. She's got the know, like if you get someone to listen.

Speaker 2:          00:24:40       I know you've been stung by a bullet in. I'd like to encourage you to try the box jellyfish and tell me it's um, yeah, it's a lot of pain. It's a kind of pain where you have to scream expletives, you know, you can't just sit there and take it. You have to be screaming something because it's that painful. It's super deadly to the very old and the very young. Um, it depends. Done. Yeah. That's, that's actually pretty good. We're talking very young five, six. We're talking about the amount of toxin to body mass basis. So if you're, if you're a little tiny kid, then that's a lot of toxin for a small body nets. If you're very old, then it's heart attacks, aneurysms, that sort of stuff. Wow. Aneurysms fucking well just it messes you up. The pain. It causes heart attacks or just freak out.

Speaker 2:          00:25:28       Yeah. Too much pain. So just the physical sensation of pain is the catalyst for these heart attacks and all these different things, but you just, your body freaks out. I mean, you aren't getting stung by a neurotoxin. Don't get me wrong. There's a little in the tentacles of the box jellyfish. There's new mattresses, a little tiny poisons, dots basically, and when it touches something biological, um, so that's why you can wear tiny little thin lycra suit or pantyhose, whatever, as long as there's something in between your skin and the box jellyfish will never stink. But if it touches something biological, then these little poisonous darts, fire and they fire into your skin and they inject a neurotoxin and it makes for an incredible amount of pain. Incredible. And uh, the first day back then was vinegar. We had a bottle of vinegar I remember clear as day.

Speaker 2:          00:26:13       My Dad came over and he got the bottle of vinegar, two liter bottle of vinegar and you just put one little splash on there and then put the lid back up and I'm sort of screaming and I'm like, what? Raul bottle on there? But he, he wanted to save some in case some of the local got stung as well. So you could. Oh my God. It's saving them for some folks he doesn't even know I got one splash dad. Yeah, I was, I was screaming some explainers Adam over that one. So how long does the pain last? Um, it was about six hours before I just passed out. It was six hours of pain sitting there

Speaker 1:          00:26:44       screaming, expletives, and then I, I guess I just talked myself out, you know, and then I passed out. I'm still painful for probably about six months. Five months. Six months. Yeah. It lasts for a long time. Not as severe as that first six hours. But it's still. Yeah, it's six months. I don't recommend it now. Oh my God. That's insane. Is that the worst thing to happen, like with, from an animal other than death? Like as far as like pain that my being, I've never heard anything that lasts six months. I'm sure getting mauled by a lion would probably. Yeah. But you know, that would be death, but you're talking about like damage, like that's ripping your tissue apart and breaking bones and things along those lines. Yeah. You're, what you're having is just this little tiny needles and it affects you for six months and that's not the worst jellyfish.

Speaker 1:          00:27:35       Everyone goes, box, jellyfish, current next flicker. I, they were all like, oh, that's the worst one. Will actually, that's what's the worst one, Cold Era Kanji. Um, it's actually a whole heap of them, but they lumped them all together into this era. Kanji, I'm sort of group and they're tiny. They're the size of your pinky fingernail. Absolutely tiny. Um, and the pain from them is more severe than a box. Jelly fish. Oh, crushed. Yeah. And, and you don't even feel the steam. Why don't we find them and kill them all my love. What's, what's wrong? Why is everybody not enough research? Not enough research on them yet. We still don't know a lot about them. Yeah. The Russians are going to use him for toxic. They're gonna. Drop my Manhattan. A big balloon. Blame the Russians don't need names. Some evil people that you don't know. I just love everyone.

Speaker 1:          00:28:20       Always blames the Russians. Yeah. Well, it's convenient. You've been accustomed to it in TV and movies for the last few decades said, well, when we were kids, the real thing was when I was a kid and I was in high school, it was always. We're worried about the Russians nuking us more worried about, you know, we'd heard about the Cuban missile crisis, the standoff, and everybody's always terrified that one day there was always the stories that, you know, there was one time where we almost went to war with Russia. There was almost a mistake and they thought missiles were in the air and they almost sent missiles, have their own mutual assured destruction. That actually happened quite a few times, you know, so that was a gigantic fear in America. But you guys movies, the bad guy was always rest assure will be eastern European of some description.

Speaker 1:          00:29:04       It's ironic really because I mean it went away for a little while. Now it's back. Not really ironic but interesting that now back with with Putin is the most potent example of like the scary Russian guy ever. Kgb Judo, black belt, completely dominating this country and some sort of a strange way. Anytime there's some sort of political adversary, they magically wind up getting shot and public. Nobody goes to jail for it. There's a lot of corruption all around the world and I find it funny that we always pick that out. I guess I'm more aligned with probably Abby Martin

Speaker 2:          00:29:42       on this one. I love your interviews with. That'd be mountain by the way. That. Yeah, they do some bad shit, but they also do some good stuff as well. Yeah, it's. Everyone's got the bad side and good. So he's openly gangster though in a weird way. Like in good. In good ways and also in bad ways. He's pretty openly gangster. Yeah. Have you ever watched him? He does the sort of public question and answer sessions for about two hours once a year or something. Oh, does he have a watch? It's really interesting to watch them actually. He's a very smart, very, very smart man and even I've even seen humor in it as well. Very, very briefly. But this humor, he likes trump. No. Really thinks trump would be a good president. You Shit me? Nope. Okay. Let's.

Speaker 1:          00:30:28       That's his guy. Older respect to head from Putin is now discipline. I might've made that up. Check it, check it, check. I don't even trust me when I look at putting ice, he wants to build it. That's what he wants. He wants stability, stability, and trump is not cash. You don't think they're that trump and Putin is over. It's over. What happened? I didn't think. Oh, but he said he liked him for awhile. Just came out yesterday. Oh, this is yesterday. So I was right for awhile. There'd been boys until recently. Oh, you know what it is because Donald trump put out this ridiculous video about our toughest opponents and he showed Putin to like doing judo throws and then he showed you. Just see that. It's a hilarious video. Play it because it's so stupid and it shows Hillary barking like a dog. It's really like. I mean you can say it's defamation, like he's doing this judo throw and he shows isis and then he throws the Democrats have the perfect answer, but you don't see that. But she's there making bark noises, bark, bark, bark, bark, bark, bark, bark, bark, bark, bark. Make America great again. See it here. You'll hear the music. She Isis, and then the Democrats have the perfect.

Speaker 1:          00:31:44       How rude can you just do that at a keys? Put fucking bark noises in her. Did she actually make those noises? Making it? Yeah. Oh, well, I guess you can put a little remix of it. I think when you're running for president, everything's fair game. But I saw a video that I've reaped tweeted today. It's called 13 minutes of Hillary Clinton lying that someone posted. It's all her saying one thing and then saying a completely different thing that she's always stood for a completely different thing she gets while they just wanted to make it so

Speaker 2:          00:32:15       you could absorb it. Yeah, I'm sure you could get deep as an Australian American politics is hilarious and also really sad.

Speaker 1:          00:32:24       That's how we feel. You guys think you're having an election right now, the rest of the world. We're viewing this as

Speaker 2:          00:32:30       cutest and yeah, you're not doing so well.

Speaker 1:          00:32:34       Yeah. Well, uh, I think it's an asshole job and I think only assholes want that job at this point in time. I think at one point in time do we. Is that the real. You're right, you're right. But it became that with special interest groups, with a corporate donations being completely unrestricted. Now corporations can kind of act as an individual and they have the freedom to act is insane. And so it's become a money grab and we're a real strange one. So what interests me is these guys like Bernie Sanders and Donald trump for two different reasons. Bernie Sanders, because he's a socialist and he doesn't want any buns money and he wants to take down corporations and he wants everybody to pay more money to their workers and he wants free healthcare and free education. And he's an extreme lefty. You No, well hang on, I've got to stop here.

Speaker 1:          00:33:22       I pay the rest of the world. Bernie sanders would be slightly left. Hillary Clinton would be probably right. And Donald trump would be out of the building on the righthand side. Yes. Because when you look at Europe, Australia is not a great example at the moment because we kind of following you guys. But when you look at Europe like yet nearly all your candidates are right of Santa, even though the Democrats or whatever. Um, Bernie Sanders I've heard a little bit about and some of the stuff I agree with, I must be too. Yeah, I do as well. I agree with a lot of social stuff a lot. I agree with the minimum wage thing and that's the one thing that I need a real talk to her. Like a real economist who's like a centrist, someone who has a real objective perspective on it because a lot of people just trying to like protect money and they don't want.

Speaker 1:          00:34:08       They definitely don't want to pay more to workers and don't want a minimum wage should be 15 bucks an hour, which we call a living minimum wage. But what I agree with a lot of his stuff as far as like people like just just social issues, you know, his issues when it comes to the legalization of recreational drugs is issues when it comes to a lot of things like education being far too expensive and students being saddled down with ridiculous amounts of debt before they get out there. Why can't we engineer a system where reasonable healthcare is taken care of for people with normal, regular stuff. There's no reason why you can't go to the world is telling you it's true, but I have friends that live in Canada and their healthcare is atrocious. The way they describe it, this is from me personally from them and there's more than one person.

Speaker 1:          00:34:59       They've had issues with needing surgery and they have to wait a year and hip the hip replacements and knee surgeries and things along those lines where they're just limping around for like a year waiting to get in Canada, but I can speak of Australia because we have obviously very similar system. Australia's fucking fan tastic by. You don't have to wait out a whole. Like I go into see a doctor in the morning and I can have a cat scan in the afternoon or what have you. You need to. If it's a knee reconstruction, yeah. You get put on the list. You wait three months. Three months is not bad because you. You might wait three months in America. Yeah, like it's, it's not that bad, but if it's something a little definitely more urgent. You're in surgery that afternoon.

Speaker 2:          00:35:38       That's great. And then also that's the public system. We don't have a private system as well, so I pay $600 a year, which most Americans find amazing, but at $600 a year and that means I have a choice where I can go to the public or the private hospital and so if I get told her you've got to wait three months, I can go, well I'll use the private health insurance in Iran on Tuesday. That's incredible.

Speaker 3:          00:35:59       Well, you have a better system than apparently what's been described to me about Canada and England as well, but I just. Australia is just so great as far as like the cities and the people like Melbourne. I was in Melbourne and I was like, man, I don't even think I want to leave. Like I could live there. Like Melbourne is fantastic,

Speaker 2:          00:36:17       but have the Australia though. It's not about the cities. It's about the outback. It's about the Great Barrier Reef. It's about the remote places. That's the. Yeah,

Speaker 3:          00:36:25       that's for you. You're, you're all about the places where you can die. Get killed by Tasmanian Shit. Tigers and shit. Well they're not really. It's like a dog, right? Task, testimonial, togare Gypsy that moving, um, where um, what's his face? Willem defoe goes and hunts. The last one finds a Tasmanian Tiger and hunted. I missed that one stupid movie. It's, it's, it seemed like a good idea. But then you watch it. It's really goofy. And then the Tasmanian tiger, obviously they're extinct. So it's a, it's a very like CGI, Tasmanian Tiger. Yeah. Like the remember the lions in a. I am legend Gooey. It. That would be like what? That's how the Tasmanian Tiger looks this? Yeah, there it is. The hunter.

Speaker 2:          00:37:06       Yeah. For some reason he was hired. I don't remember the premise defoe. So I'm kind of interested in yet at the same time.

Speaker 3:          00:37:12       Yeah. It's interesting. I mean, well the outback is. So the thing about Australia that's fascinating to me is how few people there are, but yet how enormous the, the actual country.

Speaker 2:          00:37:22       It's huge. It's the size of Europe. It's the size of a continental USA. It's huge. And there's only a 20 something million people in the entire country when he. What are we up to? Twenty four now. Somewhere. That's Los Angeles. Yeah. We've got some big deserts and stuff that we've got a lot of big space that's not really that great. I'm not habitable. Yeah. But uh, yeah, we got some. We don't have too many people and we've sold immigration not completely, so we don't have any refugee problem or anything like that. Really. Yeah, we sold it. When we solved it solved. How do you solve it? Oh, very, very simple to a trump like wall. Well, we, we've got an notion so we use that. Um, so when people come across on boats, uh, refugee boats, you know, jam packed full of people coming across. We meet them with a postcard and then we turn them around and then if they don't turn around then we get all the people on a coast guard, military boats and then we take them to another country, to a detention camp and then we put them in there. Whoa. If you're a reporter or maybe you with Red Cross or something and you go visit these dental detention camps, you can get, get put in jail for, Oh God. Ten years

Speaker 1:          00:38:36       or something for reporting on anything that's going on there. So totally we've solved the problem because you can't report on it and yeah, that seems a little fucked up, isn't it? We, you know how you had George W Bush. We had our own little George W dot Bush a few years ago. His name was Tony Abbott and he, um, he was messed up. He messed up. This is all his policies. Yeah. This is all his policy because he came into power going, well, I'm going to stop the boats. And so that's how he did it. He just shipped him off to Papua New Guinea to other countries and then made it a punishable by two years in jail to report anything about it. Wow. It's crazy. That's insane. But we solved the problem. Well, I guess you could say that, but that sounds like how trump would do it. Yeah. It's so, like you're saying that trump is right, you know, way off the charts.

Speaker 1:          00:39:25       Right. It sounds like your old president. Yeah. It's what I hate about it other than it's just terrible for the people involved is that we've lost our moral standing. We can't turn around and go, Oh, you know, China, you'll, you'll doing this, that the other four, you know, I've lost the word, but you know, we don't have that authority to have that high stance anymore because we messed up stuff to people as well. Yeah. And still going on to this day, no way. You will not make Australia home. What is that? Is that was that campaign. Holy Shit Man. But I bet you let some nice white people and I know my friends that are comedians that have moved there, that they love it there. My friend, arch barker, he's gigantic over there. He became a huge, huge star in Australia. Yeah, he's, I mean I've watched quite a few of his shows in Australia. Yeah. Yeah. Funny Man. Funny, very funny. But I mean, what's interesting is he kind of just, he's a regular comic here. Like, you know, he's like a Tony Hinchcliffe or you know, a guy who does well, he headlines and clubs over there. He's a superstar, like when I was over there, like the first time I went to Sydney and met people and they. What do you do? I'm a standup comedian. Do you judge Barker everybody? Is that a bad accident? That's probably bad.

Speaker 1:          00:40:48       Next you're going to be throwing shrimp on the Barbie or something? No, I wouldn't go that far man. I'm not, I'm not like that. Um, but anyway, Australia is awesome. So it seems like a really good place though to have a base if you want to explore like if you're from that part of the world. I have a friend, my friend Adam Green tree lives out in Australia and he's a bow hunter and he's just constantly taking these incredible. He's a great photographer as well and he has these incredible photographs on his website and I was blog. He pulls up on those up. You could see him, but he um, Adam Green tree and he's just constantly and he's got this Toyota that he had specifically set up for expeditions. I can like live out of it for like weeks. You know, most Australians have that setup. Most

Speaker 2:          00:41:34       Australians have some camping setup for a month, you know, out of their truck. I saw a lot of those like snorkels and stuff like they were super cool. Yeah, I mean you got some stretches in the outback there where you can literally go for 500 kilometers without a fuel station, so you've got to take extra fuel. You've got to. You got to be prepared. Yeah. They have those jerry cans that they strap up to the roof of the car, these gigantic jugs of gasoline, and you just illustrate the real. I put that out enough like everyone goes to. I'd been to Australia, I've been to Sydney. I'm like, no, you went to a nice city. The Real Australia is where I'm from. Cannes, you know up the North East corner where you've got rain forest and you've got a great barrier reef and you've got the outback and that sort of stuff.

Speaker 2:          00:42:17       The thing, there's the oldest evidence of life ever is on earth in Australia. There was an ancient ancient reef. There's Adams. Sam Adams photos is one of them. We've got some amazing photos that he's taken. Please go to. He's got a website, a really cool, um, but my oldest, you talk in the human habitation, no, not human biological life. There's some sort of a enormous reef that they found in Australia that was just fucking billions of years old. I mean, I do these two is where I first started with linblad. National Geographic was in the Kimberley region of Australia, which is the kind of northwest corner, incredibly remote, you know, 100 kilometers to the nearest road, wherever you go, you can only access it via these kind of ships. That's one way you can get there. And you know, you'll be cruising through 100 meter, high, 300 foot. So I'm a sandstone canyons and the rocks, there are one point 8 billion years old.

Speaker 2:          00:43:15       They predate fossils and that's the Kenyans that you're cruising through the whole. It blows your mind to see that kind of stuff. And then up there as well as the oldest human habitation. And now that's looking at about. Well there's still, the data is still coming in, but about 50,000 years old. So the, where human habitation on earth, uh, that's definitely in Australia, in the Kimberley there. I'm not sure that I'm older than Africa. Well, aboriginal people, the native people, they came into Australia once again, lots of people very the numbers on this but about 60, 70,000 years ago. So that's when they entered into Australia. Um, so they've been there for a long time, very, very long time and they're at work. They're just will blow you away. Right. But obviously people were, they, they existed in Africa earlier than that. Homo sapiens sapiens. You're talking about 200,000 years ago. They, that the species, our species kind of evolved out of Africa probably around Kenya, somewhere around there. And then we started migration. Um, and so we followed the coast, which makes sense. Most of our food was in the intertidal zone. That's where our food was. So we followed the coast. And so you go around basically Middle East all the way down into Indonesia and then across the short canoe ride, probably the first,

Speaker 1:          00:44:32       the first ocean crossing into Australia. And that's about it. Yeah. They think 70,000, 60,000 years ago. Wow. Yeah, it's a that culture's been there for a long time and there's a lot we can learn from aboriginal people. In fact, there's a lot of good, lots of interesting stuff. Another horrible human rights violation that you guys did. Store aboriginal kids. The empire strikes again, started to raise them. Yeah, we did some. We did some saying we you and I didn't kill any sharp. Didn't do it and steal any aboriginal babies who can't keep saying we. Well, I'm part of humanity, you know? Yes. A little bit of blind for it. Oh, I don't know about blame, but we're, we're a part of the race that has done some fucked up shit, but as also created cell phones. Well, that pool, that's all forgiven then. Real planes.

Speaker 1:          00:45:20       No, not forgiven, but you know, it's sort of like your perspective thing when you talking about sharks. Yeah. You gotta put it into perspective. How many people have actually stole aboriginal babies? You know, when you look at the billions of people in the entire planet, very few have actually done that. Native cultures have had a really hard hard truck and they have and if aliens landed we'd have a hard time and so that's how it always is. The most technologically advanced society thinks when it finds some sort of a native society that's living in a, a way that they used to live a long time ago. Like, Oh, you fuckers, you don't even know what you're doing yet. Like you got to figure out this whole wheel gun thing. So this whole, you know, they were living sustainably and environment for them 70,000 years and not, you know, not doing anything basically wrong or harming that environment at any stage. And then, you know, we know better. Yeah. That's how we think, I guess. But I mean, we definitely shouldn't do that, but I don't want to live on horseback and chase buffalo with a stick.

Speaker 1:          00:46:21       I mean, you hear this, everyone thinks that doing something about climate change or environment or something is gonna make a reduction in your, your living. Oh, that's a totally different argument. I'm talking about invading into places where people are living. You know, this digitas lifestyle. Like, this is an issue, they have them right now in the Amazon. These tribes that are essentially completely they, they're almost non influenced by Western civilization, but I mean when you come to like changing lifestyle and things to make up for what we're doing to the environment. Yeah. No arguments here. This is obviously some shit going down. Oh yeah. It's a little warm out. Lately. It was a little warm at lately. Last month. What was it? The northern hemisphere two degrees above industrial times Celsius is. It's interesting. You know I'm better than cooling though. Cooling is much more terrifying.

Speaker 1:          00:47:12       Global Cooling is horrifying. That's when populations dropoff. That's when innovation drops off. That's when it gets really scary. I would say the warming since going to be just as bad. Have you ever read any of the work or listened to any of the work by Randall Carlson is a fascinating, fascinating, but I can't recall. It's been on the podcast several times. Maybe you've heard them. They're it with Graham Hancock as well, but he's an expert in impacts and asteroid impacts. Oh yes. Okay. He was doing this stuff out of Utah or whatever, all the glacial thing and he's basically taken his entire life studying both climate change that, you know, prehistoric climate change, climate change, but within the last ice age until now, and connecting some of the climate change, some of it with a impacts with asteroidal impacts at the end of the ice age, which is, you know, 10 plus down. Why would it not like, well there's evidence, actual evidence of impacts and, and, and um, what they call nuclear, a nuclear glass, I think it's called [inaudible] night and it's from a, you get it when they do nuclear test sites, they find it and you also get it from a meteor impact sites and it's just like really cool looking green glass where the ground understands.

Speaker 1:          00:48:32       Tend to. Yeah. But it's all over Europe and Asia and around 12,000 years and they are pointing to that as evidence of a massive impacts. Like we got hit by everyone. I mean, the, the layman always goes, oh, the last unit, big impact 65 million years ago, you know, the kt boundary with dinosaurs and stuff like that. There has been impacts constant since then and uh, and this, we just need more evidence basically to fill in the gaps, but there's been a lot of impacts. We, it wouldn't surprise me in our lifetime that we see an impact. Yeah, we will. Well, we certainly have on other planets. We saw a giant one on Jupiter that was, that was crazy. Oh my God. She Maka leave it. Yeah. Yes. Shoemaker Levy was as large as the entire planet earth. That's how big the impact was. Well, not the rock itself. The impact of the implosion was as large as the planet earth.

Speaker 1:          00:49:26       Apparently that's the place to use your budget. Maybe. Maybe, you know. Yeah. Yeah. It's come a bit of space. Defensive. Yeah. I hope they can figure that out. We'll think about it. We probably the first species on this planet to ever get to the point where we could we have the technology to defend the planet from these cataclysmic events were the first people to have that ability, but we're not using it well. We're the first people to come close to having that ability. I think they have some inkling as to how to do that right now. Like a coating them with some sort of a, a silicone or something like that. For whites. You nudge them and nudge them is easiest way. You just go land something on them with a rocket on it and then stopped burning that rocket and if you do it early enough you will change the trajectory enough to see this so many of them. That's part of the problem, right? There's like $900,000 year herth objects. Yeah, but it's within our power. We can do it and it's crazy that we're not because really that's, that's something can really mess

Speaker 2:          00:50:28       up society that we currently have.

Speaker 3:          00:50:30       That's a nice way of putting it. Mess Up. Yeah. Maybe Australia be the spot. Well, you guys have been hit too. That was one of the things that Randall concentrated on. He showed these slides last time he was here maybe the time before that where he showed these massive tsunami erosion marks all over this one area of Australia, which indicate there was something that landed in the ocean off the coast and just caused massive, massive tidal waves. I think he was saying, if I remember correctly, somewhere around 6,000 plus years ago. Yeah. But

Speaker 2:          00:51:03       those tidal waves from earthquakes, you know, you don't even have to have an impact against an army coming in and the tsunami, if you don't remember the one sort of in Indonesia and stuff like that. And Sri Lanka liked it can do a lot of damage. You know,

Speaker 3:          00:51:16       I was looking at your notes, man. Did you see a Ufo? I, I think so. Well it's a flying

Speaker 2:          00:51:24       object. Yes I did. Was it little aliens in green men? I'm not too sure on that one. Um, do you think it might've been need more evidence? Um, where was it? So I spent a lot of time on boats when I was growing up, you know, so I would spend months or months added, see, and uh, so I'd regularly, you know, be in the middle of nowhere, thousand kilometers from the nearest town, a light source. And so you'd go out middle of the night, go to the toilet, a toilet on a boat is basically go over to the side, hang, hanging over the railing. And uh, and so you look at these stats like and there you see this, you see satellites, you see, you know, the most, most people I don't think even have ever seen the amount of stars you can get when you get to a very remote location to the point where you see individual satellites going over and stuff like that.

Speaker 2:          00:52:09       And so that's what I grew up doing most nights, you know, I would be sitting there and looking at this and once or twice I did see some stuff that you go hang on and being a bit of a bit of an aviation buff, I love sort of space and aviation go, hang on, that's not quite right. That doesn't make sense of how that object went that way. And then turned around and went the other way. How old were you? Oh, we were talking between 10 to 15, somewhere in there. My memory between that age is dog shit. But it was more than one on one occasion, but we're in the middle of nowhere. Like we were literally, if there was ever, if you're doing a secret military, which a plane flight or something, that would be the place to do it because we're in the middle of nowhere.

Speaker 2:          00:52:49       And what did you say? What did you do? I'm seeing some, some big lights, uh, going to slow a fair distance. Why? Nothing over and over I think. But you know, going off into the distance. And then I remember seeing one time where I went out there and started doing my thing and then I saw a light that looked like, you know, Venus, you know, like a bright star. I'm like, hmm, that's interesting. Bit light for Venus to be up because normally Venus's right at the start, sunset sunrise. So I think it's a bit strange. And then you know, and then you look back and it's moved and then hang on and then you try and work it out with the boat moving and stuff like that. And then it just started

Speaker 1:          00:53:26       to move and then turn around and move the other way. And it's just like my, from my knowledge of aviation, it's like, eh, there's nothing really. They can do that. So what it was, who knows? But I just, I find the whole thing fascinating. I find it interesting. Yeah. I think I. well first of all, I want to believe so bad. I always have, from the time I was a child and I think many people share that romantic notion of how amazing it would be if we were visited by some intelligent life. We're not aliens and it's a big waste of space. Well, the most likely is something alive out there. The question is whether or not it's visiting us. Yeah, and if it did visit us, it would have to be so far removed from what we think is possible and as far as like technology, but we also, I think part of what's going on with our own minds when we consider the future, so we know that technology keeps improving, we keep innovating, we keep coming up with new methods for all sorts of different things and one day we're most likely going to be able to regularly journey to other parts of the universe.

Speaker 1:          00:54:32       Most likely if we raised NASA's budget slightly, well, nothing new. Well I think private sector is probably the best option. I mean when when people start finding profit in visiting, I mean if they can figure out how to mine for diamonds, is there like one of Jupiter's moons or something like that? It's made out of fucking diamonds, like moments. It's actually another planet they found out in the like one of the newly discovered planets. Planets, if you find that there's a fucking planet made out of diamonds out there, well we think based on looking at wavelengths of light coming from hundreds of light years away. Not really. We. Sorry, could you get it here? It is. Language. Yeah. English is a astronomers discover a planet made of diamonds. Jesus called riced racing around a tiny star and our galactic backyard, so if they could figure out how to visit that they had below a fuck.

Speaker 1:          00:55:26       First of all, diamonds would be worth like a dollar. Well, I mean that whole gravity waves thing is, is a great step forward. Then suddenly we are seeing that you can adjust gravity. Gravity is adjustable to a certain degree. That's probably where the interstellar technology will come from. More research into that area and the fact that we just kind of. We. They just proved that concept that they sort of bastardized in the event horizon. You ever seen that movie where they talk about folding space time and punching a hole through the two points, so you would surmount. You would rather you would traverse insurmountable distances and a very short period of time. My understanding is that's wound whole log where with the gravity waves it's probably star trek does it well enterprise where you basically, you're just adjusting this, the fabric of space time in front and behind the ship and so

Speaker 3:          00:56:24       you're not moving faster than the speed of light. You're just kind of making a bubble in the space time that you then traveling. Um, it's fascinating when you read right into it and I think that's probably where it'll come from. But yeah, we need a lot more studying on that one. Yeah, you think you'll get there. But we will. I mean if we, if humans survive 100,000 years, I mean imagine. And that's the concept. The concept is if there is some life form out there, we've been alive or this planet rather has been around for four point something billion years. So if something just had a different combination of elements and maybe perhaps lives in a protected area where they don't have a gigantic asteroid field just outside of distance between Mars and Jupiter, you know, like we do or I mean there's only, there's comments and they might live in some protected area where they have more freedom to, uh, to grow and innovate.

Speaker 3:          00:57:16       And we're in a goldilocks zone if you really look into it. Like for us, we totally, Nicole, it looks on the moon, right? But you know, the dinosaurs is only 65 million years ago got completely fucking smashed by a rock like that could happen. You know, and you know, the big crater outside Nevada like these, there's so many of them that could mean that it is possible though, that there is a source system out there that doesn't have this issue, that for whatever reason doesn't have nearly as many asteroids. And so some life form has been innovating for millions of years more than us. But that is when we can do that right now. That's what I'm saying. We have the technology right now to stop these cataclysmic impacts. I think you're being a little. I didn't say this. I think they miss a lot of them, a good percentage of them because of the gravity and the way the sun is and the sun is so fucking massive, a million times larger than the earth that I think when things are coming behind the sun, oftentimes they don't even see them until it's too late and until we could figure that out and you've got these fucking Manhattan sized chunks or rock for in our way, I think a one day maybe we'll be able to do it, but my point being that it is possible that there's some sort of a civilization out there that doesn't have to deal with impacts that may be maybe they've developed in a way that they don't have predators the way we do.

Speaker 3:          00:58:38       They haven't. They don't have this need for, for warfare the way that we do. Maybe they have some unique method of communication that allows for more understanding than just mouth noises. Well, I mean, I wouldn't say it's a need, but it is. It is prevalent throughout history, so it seems to be a part of humans. It's. It's arguable that we can move past it for sure, and I certainly hope we can. Obviously we can. We can do it in small groups. We can do it in cities. We can do, but war has existed as long as humans have existed. So you would say if you were studying human beings objectively, not idealistically, not, not looking at things through rose colored glasses, you would say, well, this is what humans do. It's one of the things they do. You know, if you were studying us as an animal, if you were some species from another planet, you'd say, well, they do shoot each other a lot as a collective group.

Speaker 3:          00:59:27       Yes. Go to the individual level. And I think, yeah, I think the opinion is totally different. You go to an individual, they don't want to kill other people. It's in human nature. We don't want to kill other people. Right. But I mean it just objective. I mean, it's sort of like the way you look at sharks, you know, and you look at sharks, you say, well, you know, they only kill five of us a year, so you know, really they're harmless. Well, they are kind of harmless them to one of them fucking bites you, you know. And that's sort of the same way about people. Yes, most of the time humans are wonderful. Most of the Times people are like, you and I have a drink, we clink glasses, we enjoy our company, we have a great chat and that's most of the interactions you're ever going to have with people are great most, most times, like the vast majority of interactions you have, especially in America where there's plenty of food, there's plenty of space and people are well taken care of.

Speaker 3:          01:00:13       Most of the time everything's gonna be great, but when you tally up the numbers for 7 billion people and then the battle for natural resources and then religious ideologies come into play and there's a lot of fucking killing going on constantly. You know, I mean, so it's, it's an unavoidable. I mean, you could certainly make the argument that we can do better, but if you just want it to look at us right now, just know ideology attached. Just look at what a human being is. Human beings killed. We're killing all over the place. We're killing each other all over the place. It's just happening right now as we're talking. There's people shooting people is bombs going off and people killing themselves as it's going on. So it's. It is a part of human beings that we have, we have come to accept, but it doesn't necessarily mean that other life forms have this, you know?

Speaker 3:          01:01:01       I mean there it is potentially possible to wasted resources. Any evolved alien that we've ever encountered. I would say very unlikely that they would do will fit because it's just such a waste of resources. It's. Yeah. How do you get to interstellar travel? If you spending all your money working on new ways to kill each other, it just, it doesn't work well. Also like what's the benefit of it? Like what is the benefit of it? The benefit of it is all personal. It's all like a whatever group gets to dominate the resources, whatever group gets to, you know, maybe their, their genetics pass on Gangam style, whereas the, the, the people that were dominated, they don't get to it. It's all very primitive and a lot of ways. It's very animalistic. The biggest Dick Syndrome now in some way. Yeah, it's a genetic thing, right. But if we get past that, like one of the weirder things in Ufo folklore is the idea of genetic manipulation. The idea that human beings have been created by which the lady six files video. No, I did not. I haven't seen the new x files. Is it good? Is it on Fox again? Um, I don't even know. What time is it now? I think it's great that they're doing it again. I probably should watch it. It's like the old one. The reason I bring it up is because that's pretty much what the last two episodes is all about. What's going on and on about that. Well, that's a big theme

Speaker 1:          01:02:21       in Ufo Folk Lore and also in Zechariah sections work. Do you know about that guy? Once again? Heard of him to, I don't think about anything. He's just a guy who was a biblical scholar and a linguist and he knew a lot about ancient languages and he had a very controversial, uh, he, he did. What he did is he went over the Sumerian texts, the cuneiform clay tablets with the weird lines and, and what he came up with. And really, he's like the only one out of all the other Sumerian scholars. He believes that the Annunaki which are descriptive depicted in these ancient Sumerian texts. He believe it was an ancient. He believed it was an ancient civilization of aliens that came down here. And their planet is in an elliptical orbit. The travels between Mars and Jupiter. Yeah, exactly. Which they now think is they now think there is a planet out there and they don't know out.

Speaker 1:          01:03:26       Yes. Yeah. They don't necessarily think it's a new bureau, which is what he called it and what they called it in the text, but his, his, um, deciphering of the Sumerian Texas, hugely controversial. And there's a website actually called Sitchin is wrong. And if you go to in Israel, I think it's dot com might be.org, but if you go to switch and is wrong, they sort of highlight all the errors that they believe he made, but it's so convoluted like you have to be some sort of a scholar to even understand the argument and you have to understand cuneiform that weird writing with a little lines and, but the, um, some of the ancient clay tablets, forget about understanding the language. The ancient clay tablets are fascinating. I mean they had a, an exact description of the solar system, a drawing of all the planets in the proper order with the proper sizes.

Speaker 1:          01:04:17       And this is 6,000 years ago, including Pluto. Ancient culture is amazing. And I think it was probably when I first started listening to you is the interview with Graham Hancock. It was just such a big fan. I've read all his books, love him to death. And uh, and I remember reading his books, you know, back in the day called whatever it was, early nineties or something. And reading. Yeah, anxious. And it just made sense to me that there is lots of ancient civilizations going way back and the evidence is everywhere. You just have to open your eyes a little bit to it. And you know, I love that. Back then in the nineties it was pseudoscience. Today it's like, yeah, of course, of course there's lots of ancient civilizations and we just need to find more and more. And I think one of the best ones is, did you ever hear about in Egypt? You know, because they uncover. So Lula nature, there's so much more they see the new stuff that I sold that two days ago. No, no, not the lightest. They believe they found Nefertiti's tomb who they found they found two hidden tombs in Egypt than they believe they might have located where she was buried. You see that Jamie? I

Speaker 3:          01:05:18       retweeted it like two days, like maybe yesterday. I think what I find it in King Tut's tomb, 90 percent chance of hidden chambers. And I think it's an effort tds resting place.

Speaker 2:          01:05:28       Fucking quarter. I was getting at is that this researcher, she took the data from satellites, ground penetrating radar. Oh, sorry, yeah. Do you see that documentary? Fascinating and they're just shows that the whole of Egypt was just covered in these terms underground. They're everywhere and there's so much more information and the more research we do, we're going to find out as ancient civilizations going way, way back. I mean, I don't know, Egypt very well, never been, but in Australia, in the Kimberley, there's this two types of artwork. Then there's this one which is from the aboriginal people that live there and it's been going on for a couple thousand years. Then there's this other artwork called the bradshaw or going on going on and we know it's over 30,000 years old, but really it could be a lot, lot further, so it's from a group of people who were in Australia before the aboriginal and you look at some of these pitches and they're amazing, amazingly intricate and you can't even see the joker anymore.

Speaker 2:          01:06:23       There's no paint anymore. It's just the shadow of where the paint was. That's what you're actually viewing because it's so old, so they can't actually carbon date it. They just look at say a wasp nest grows on top of it and then the carbon date that. So they go, okay, well it's older than the wasp nest and so we're talking around about 30,000, probably a bit more, but some of his artwork is crazy and I've. I've never seen it personally but there is one out there drawing which basically has pictures of these, you know, the people who have to go and go and brad short people these long really skinny long sort of people. There's one with a Ufo in it as well and intricate drawings of all the animals that were there and it's fascinating stuff and once again one guy did a lot of research and he, a lot of his research still hasn't been released of where it all is and what's going on. There is literally everywhere you walk up there, there's this ancient, ancient our. It's crazy and it's from a culture that is very, very old. Probably 30 to 50,000 in my opinion. The data suggest over over 25,000 years ago.

Speaker 3:          01:07:23       That's so fascinating to me. Just when you were talking about going through those canyons and it's one point 8 billion years old that the amount of time this sort of impossible to grasp distance in time, it's, it's we in our mind, we just can't. It's just we just can't. And so that when you think about that, like this insurmountable amount of time and then think about like just 30,000 years ago, which is still insurmountable. I mean we think of about $30,000 in comparison to one point 8 billion not that long ago, but it's impossible. You, your mind is not going to get it. It's a number. It's like I have $30,000 like that. You understand? You make $30,000, you understand $30,000, you don't understand 30,000 years. It just not to get in there.

Speaker 1:          01:08:16       At least my, my comprehension for you, you just can't even comprehend it. But the Graham Hancock stuff combined with the Randall Carlson stuff is to me where it all sort of comes together because Randall Carlson offers an explanation for these. These civilizations being so advanced but yet all essentially wiped out, just rising sea levels can explain that so many people don't know that the sea level was about 150 meters lower than it is today. Um, and so all these civilizations, civilizations are always put on the coast, so you're right on the coast. Massive amount of people and suddenly a hundred and 50 meters of waters there. There is so much that we still discover on our coast in 150 meters of water. There will be lots and lots of evidence down there, but it gets covered in silt within a thousand years and it's hard to find someday they're going to find Miami.

Speaker 1:          01:09:06       They're going to find my. They go, what the hell happened here? Jesus Christ, just bags of coke and fake tits. They're just going to find like stilettos Ferrari's under water. I liked that as a thought experiment of go forward 10,000 years and be a geologist looking back at our little timeframe here, the anthropocene or whatever you want to call them, where humans have been impacting the planet like that layer of rock. What are you going to find in it? I found that interesting. What do you think is going to be there? They're going to find those kettlebells behind you. The Werewolf one. You're going to fuck with these people doing. They're going to find, well, you're going to find only stone. Really, essentially. I mean, have you ever seen that? Um, uh, there was a documentary that they did where they showed what would happen within a thousand years if we just abandoned cities.

Speaker 1:          01:09:50       Like what would happen? How could you have to take into documentary series? That was it. Yeah. Amazing, right? Yeah. Well there's some photos of Detroit. It's really interesting how nature is taking over buildings in Detroit. Like trees are growing through the center of houses and it's just only within a few decades, the main source of erosion in the kimberleys and stuff like that is plants. And so in the, in the dry season, they grow into the cracks and stuff. That routes. And then in the wet season, they resemble this water and their route swell and exerts a pressure about, I think that 3000 psi, it just literally just cracks it. And that happens to concrete if you're not constantly pulling that, all those grass seeds and making sure stuff isn't growing around concrete, all our infrastructure will be crumbled and very little left just by plants are amazing. Yeah. I pulled the wire and pull it.

Speaker 1:          01:10:37       I had a problem my toilet and put this on Instagram, find that, that toilet monster. So, uh, I had the guy come over the plumber guy and just doesn't flush. I don't know what's going on. So he was like a snake that has a camera on it and they find that there was a crack in the pipe and the roots had gone through the small crack in the pipe, gotten inside the toilet pipe and filled the entire pipe with a root system. I mean it looked like an animal. I mean we're talking about something that was like four plus feet long. Enormous look it, leave that up there. They pulled that out of my toilet. And then it's saying, yeah, but does it surprise me? Doesn't surprise me there now, but back then I was like, what the fuck? They will be. I mean that life after people, you watch that thing, they get to 100 years and you barely recognize the city 100 years later.

Speaker 1:          01:11:32       Yeah, there's some plans. There's some cool photos of in Detroit. Look at that photo of this. These houses that are just being taken over by trees. That's the center of a house. It just trees grow in the middle of it. They burst through the foundation, they break through the bottom floors. They go through the ceiling, they fill up. Look at that house. Yeah. Well this is something that we were talking about before we started the show. You were talking about being in Costa Rica and these people see what you would call like Phantom Pyramids. They think people always want to. They. It's very beneficial to find ancient structure. So there's a. there's a few ancient structures throughout the world that are extremely controversial because people look at them and they go, well then another say yard. Dang. That's like A. Essentially it's a structure that is just a natural structure that you're trying to attribute to a civilization.

Speaker 1:          01:12:20       Well, there's enough ancient structures out there to be amazed. Let's just put that forth. Like you don't need to find hundreds of them. The the, the 20 or 30 that we have is amazing. Right. But we like finding them in our yard. Yeah. I was a cheer Polo if you ever heard of that. That's where I went. And Costa Rica. I was visiting my cousin down there and a vibe. I just got to put that out there. Like when you're up in the mountains there. I had a little Sabina on the top of a ridge looking over this massive valley and the vibe and the like. It's just phenomenal because the indigenous people there are still relatively in touch with the natural environment and there's large areas here with me as a gringo. I can't go. I can't go anywhere near it. I'm only the. The indigenous people there and people look at satellite maps and they go, yeah, this is one massive pyramid.

Speaker 1:          01:13:09       The largest pyramid in the world could also just be a mountain as well. Like I'm all about evidence. Show me the evidence and um, I've got an open mind. I'm happy I do. They think it's the largest pyramid normal just by. If you look at the satellite data and then draw it out, it would be the largest pyramid in the world. Right? But what makes them think that it's a pyramid shape and stuff like that? Yeah, I, that's it right there. That's a fucking mountain bitch you get out of here. So that's ridiculous. Well, there's actually a dance where I live, there's a place called Walters pyramid and there is actually this Little Hill Mountain, whatever you want that's in the shape of a pyramid perfectly. And this, it's in Cannes called Walsh's pyramid. People run up and down it all the time. There's a big fitness thing for it's, you know, and that's pretty much a pyramid, but it's just a, it's just a natural formation. So it's not a pyramid, but that mountain is a mountain. It's like saying the earth is the biggest soccer ball in the world. I mean, it kind of is.

Speaker 2:          01:14:12       If we were big enough to kick it.

Speaker 3:          01:14:13       Yeah, exactly. You know, but it's, it's the earth. We found a huge ball. It's 24,000 miles in a circle and you're standing on it.

Speaker 2:          01:14:22       As I said before, the show to Costa Rica. This is so crazy. People down there. Look, I've got an open mind. I'm willing to listen to people, but uh, yeah, show me the evidence. There's a way that you can get

Speaker 3:          01:14:33       when you party too much, where your grasp on reality is like holding onto a dolphin with olive oil on your hands and you just, you just can't quite grasp it. And I've met a lot of people like that. All, lot of people like that because of my reputation within a, you know, quote unquote psychedelic community and my connections to marijuana on psychedelic drugs and all that stuff. I've met so many I've met before I go negative, amazing people. I've met some really fascinating openminded people that have Dennis Mckenna, the Lorenzo haggerty. I met some amazing people, but I've also met some, like some people that they've lost their ability to discern what might be possible versus what you're adding to all this stuff to make it more fantastic than it really is. And, and by doing so, you're, you've entered into this sort of fantasy land and you've sort of negated all potential realistic, uh, interpretations of.

Speaker 2:          01:15:39       Yeah. When I meet people at that, and I do too, I always push them towards them saying, okay, so you've read these books now, now going to read a physics textbook and just get all your information. Then make your own opinions, your opinion.

Speaker 3:          01:15:51       Well, you're dealing with more high level people. You're dealing with book readers. I'm dealing with youtube watchers, man. I am really lucky to new into a youtube video about reptilians. Don't be so quick to dismiss them, brother. There are amongst.

Speaker 2:          01:16:05       So I'm very lucky that in my job and I guess the brand national geographic as well, it brings in people who are progressive nature lovers, chimney rather intelligent. I have dinner with these people and that's probably the biggest perks for me is you meet people who are just fascinating because they always attack you with questions, so you spend half the meal just answering questions like we're doing now kind of thing, and then then eventually turn around and go, well, what do you do? And generally the graduates of Harvard or mit and it's like, what do you do? Well, on the International Space Station, the little box that spins the solar panels, I invented that, you know, even some. I met a, I think it was the older George Bush, George H, w Bush, his lawyer had some very pertinent questions for him. You just meet some really interesting people that are kind of unknown I suppose to a certain degree and just hearing their opinions and their life story. It's fascinating. People are fascinating.

Speaker 3:          01:17:01       Well, it seems like being involved in national geographic would make kind of like a magnet for curiosity in the creek. Curious people

Speaker 1:          01:17:10       just come to you and go, Ooh, that's as soon as you messaged me, I was like, Ooh, this fucking guy's seen some shit. Yep. Yeah. There's a lot of, I've worked on other ships that don't have the national geographic brand and yet you still get 50 percent really cool, interesting people, but then you get a group of people who also aren't that interested in what's going on and that's kind of a selling point is that we have all these experts on there. I mean, I wouldn't go so far. It's called myself an expert, but like we went to Easter island a couple months ago and we had the world expert on Easter island on board the ship. That was, that was the guy that was living next door to me. That's the guy from your instagram page. A. Yeah. Yeah. Year. Yes. Last name. How do you pronounce it? Jamie? Christiana crop on instagram. Um, his, uh, the photos of Easter island to me. I am absolutely blown away by Easter Island and perplexed and fascinated and, and I always try to understand. I'm like, why would someone spend so much time to make these statues and where are they getting these stones from and like. And they go deep, deep, deep into the ground. Like when you go deeper into the ground, you see that it's not just a head and there's a whole body and a full figure down there.

Speaker 1:          01:18:26       What do you mean or is that fake? That's all those pictures where they dug into the ground. You see like this, this shoulders and stuff like that. They're not. Well, I suppose you could say that some of them do have bodies. Yes, but most of the ones you see the most of them are like that just to show most of them, but that's what you see. But under the ground isn't there more? I mean this is obviously a victim of erosion, right? These things have been eroded by time and wind and sand. These ones actually they couldn't be bothered moving them. These are right. The quarry, this is where they've cut them out of the side of the mountain. This group right here and so and then they haven't been bothered or whatever's happened. Haven't been bothered to move. The cute doug who's doggy, just random dog came up and set my photos everywhere.

Speaker 1:          01:19:07       Really? It was like a wild dog. Yeah. Yeah. Just there's so many dogs on that island and they're all so friendly and lovely and I will as soon as I see that. I know that's a good community. One of the things for me straightaway dog. Yeah, so I'm Jamie, see if he could find those photos of Easter island where they dig. There's some expeditions that they've done where they've dug out around the statues and dug deep down and you could see arms. It's more than just ahead. Well the one, the photo that had on the instagram there with Claudia, she, he's sitting next to you go to this thing, goes all the way down. She his hands, his arms, the big one. Yeah. That's a big one, but that's real, right. I personally didn't see that was from the Ucla, but there is what I was describing where the one picture I have it. Claudio. He's got a whole heap that got knocked over by a tsunami and he's put them back up and they're full ones with. They basically standing up with their hands over their belly. Yeah. Like that. So you have the. Well, with the top hat on top, what is that? One of the upper left Jamie with heads about. Yeah, right

Speaker 2:          01:20:07       there. What the hell is that? That's fake, right? Right. Yeah, yeah. Feel like yoga. Don't get me wrong. The first question, when I got there, the first question, I was like bodies underneath and first question, but um, they to help because they didn't want to dig crazy. Gringos sorts of politics always, always with anything like this is their crazy politics. Is it hard when you go to these, these communities because you want to respect their cultures and their way, but you also want to kind of get to the bottom of these things as much as you can in a brief amount of time. I suppose. How do I attack that one? Um, I, I suppose when you get the expert on board, you know, and then you get to hear about all these sort of stuff. But I guess most people going through here wouldn't hear half the stuff that we learn about because you don't have that world experts sitting there.

Speaker 2:          01:20:54       You've got just some random two guide or something like that. So there's a lot to it and I know with Claudio he had epic battles with the alternate because he just wanted to restore, it was just a big pile of them piled up and he wanted to come in here with a crane and put them all back to how they were and yeah, the amount of flack and backlash and trouble that he went through over, I think it was more than five years to do it. So unfortunate. But that happens in so many of these places where they want to sort of preserve the narrative, like they have a narrative and they've been, you know, giving these speeches and they have this idea of a timeline, how everything was done and when new evidence comes along, very, very reluctant to accept it. You find that a lot in Egypt.

Speaker 2:          01:21:35       Well, I mean he's the guy that wrote 20 papers about that particular narrative and you've just come over and say, oh actually that's all wrong. Or different aspects of it. Of course they're gonna bring it up and it's a lot of pushback is the coolest like that. What I found very interesting about Australia was the birdman culture. Yes, go into it though, please. So you've got this, this culture with statues and stuff, and then that culture actually kind of died out, but it definitely went out of favor and then you had the birdman culture come into it and that was the last one to be there. When you know, at Western civilization kind of turned up and that was crazy. It was a competition every year where they would all run, swim out to another island, down a steep cliff. Holly would die in the process and try and get the first egg, basically the first egg from the turns there and then have to bring it all the way back in.

Speaker 2:          01:22:25       The first one back with his egg was then the, I guess some sort of analogy would be Jesus basically, but you know, somewhere he's the God basically and, and so, but his manner, his energy was then far too powerful for anyone to have any contact with him. So He's as winning his prize was he would go live in a little hut by himself for the rest of the year. He wasn't allowed to cut his fingernails or hear anything for a year and then they can come back. But his group, his tribe would then be the leaders of the island. Okay. So basically all the different groups would. Every year they're changeover who's in control and that will keep everyone happy. So there wasn't one particular group that was in charge of everything. It, it varied based on who won the Birdman and competition that year, how they came up with that. I have no idea.

Speaker 3:          01:23:15       It's so bizarre. There's so many weird styles of culture, like the way people decide to run their stuff. Yeah. So strange. Like how the hell does that ever come about where everyone agrees. All right, the dude who gets the egg, you're Jesus, you got to live by yourself. So it's like I don't want to live by myself and he probably doesn't want to live by himself either. So it's like a bittersweet victory. A GAM Jesus. But now I can't even cut my fingernails. I got to live in a fucking hut by myself, but I'm full of so much manner. Well, there's so many really uber bizarre cultural traditions all around the world. I'm sure you're aware of the semen warriors in New Guinea semen. Yes.

Speaker 2:          01:23:58       Now I've traveled extensively through puppeting Guinea. You'll have to enlighten.

Speaker 3:          01:24:01       Oh, it's awful. It's essentially a culture of child molestation where they take children from the time they're very young and they moved them away from their mother and they move into these bachelor groups and they have these older men and these younger boys and they essentially tell these younger boys that the only way for them to grow up and be strong, and we're talking about a culture that says thousands and thousands of members, the only way for them to grow up and be strong is to ingest semen so they have to ingest it orally and annually and it is a an ancient tradition of these semen warriors in New Guinea and they have. They've grown up being molested and then molesting new children as they come up and it's homosexual molestation and stuff. Yeah, I mean it's. This is documented, this is not like something I'll make on that

Speaker 2:          01:24:55       crazy stuff pumping to Guinea. I spent a lot of time in asthma and region, which actually is in Papa New Guinea, Indonesia, but let's not go there. You see anything about that Jamie? Yeah. I found something on wikipedia called the Toro tribe. It's really dark man. They think it extended their life for homosexual sex prolongs life and heterosexual relationships are focused towards reproduction.

Speaker 3:          01:25:19       Yeah. And then also it makes the young men strong. They think the only way for them to grow and become strong as by adjusting semen

Speaker 2:          01:25:28       only 20 years ago in the Hazmat region, they were head hunters. They were cannibals, I mean end to say, oh, there's no cannibalism anymore is kind of a bit of a lie as well. There still cannibalism in Papa New Guinea just deleted each other, not out front row center, but they keep it offline basically to keep it off of youtube. Um, but yeah, there's some crazy stuff going on there, especially in the Hazmat region. I spent quite a bit of time there and what I find interesting is you got this culture as old as the aboriginals in Australia, you know, we're talking 60,000 years old, very old culture, living in perfect harmony nature in the mangroves there and they're not even, they're not even stone people that just would. People you know, they don't even have anything and then now you have, it's, it's an Indonesian province and you have a lot of mosques being built and a lot of stuff that's kind of creeping in.

Speaker 2:          01:26:18       Western civilization is creeping in and the most disgusting thing I saw is that they, they've always gone down to the market and bought some food and it's in wrapped in banana leaf. They eat the food and they throw the banana leaf off the board, walk into the water. Now the mercantile empires now in there, you know there's lots of other people, a Chinese Japanese coming in and being merchants and they sell everything in plastic, single use packets and so the same thing. There's no garbage bins, there's nothing around. They open it, they eat the food, they throw the plastic over there is a meter and a half to two meters of just piles of plastic everywhere. Absolutely everywhere because they don't have any ability that I've got no education on it. They've got no garbage collection and it's bloody disgusting. Like it's crazy that you go to a beach scene in Australia and you'll see one or two bits of plastic and like, oh, this is terrible. When you pick it up, you go there and you're like, I need like 50 dump trucks to even get it. Stop on this. The plastic problem in the ocean is huge and it's not until you kind of get go through Indonesia. Even the Maldives Seychelles so much plastic everywhere and it's like meter high in places.

Speaker 3:          01:27:27       Heard the Maldives is one of the primary groups of islands that are at risk of a global warming of being.

Speaker 2:          01:27:35       The highest point on the capital in the Maltese is two meters high. Whoa. Yeah. When the tsunami in 2004 came, it went over the entire island. I think it was only a little tiny patch that didn't have seawater go over it. It's crazy. I've got a picture on the instagram is one of the first pictures ever put up there. All of the capital and you'll see it's something like 250,000 people in a tiny little island and it's shocking like there. They're serious, just pumped straight out. There's another island next to it that's the garbage island where they just take all the garbage and burn it. So it's this constant, massive fire on the nearest island where they just burn garbage. It's environmental catastrophe

Speaker 3:          01:28:15       that went through that. That's the Maldives? Yeah. Oh my God. But this is Indonesia, Papua New Guinea. Like oh my God. That picture. So disturbing. That first picture, Jamie, go back to that first one that you posted. Oh my God. Yeah. That is God damned insane. Yeah,

Speaker 2:          01:28:37       no, they were on these tours and we would actually spend the first hour before guests come over just cleaning up plastic and then the first guest to come over with generally help us clean plastics as well, and we would take back 10, 20 bags of garbage just so you could walk along a little bit of the beach and not have plastic everywhere.

Speaker 3:          01:28:52       Oh my God. That's horrible. Wow. When you, when you see the sheer numbers game, Jamie, what was

Speaker 1:          01:29:02       your google search so people could check out these images that are listening to this plastic island? Oh, that's so horrific. It's an entire island is just covered with shit plastic. Wow. People are so quick and they're just finding it. That's the only way they can do anything about it. It was burning and that's the only 250,000 people. Right? Well that's the capital. I'm leery of that. Oh my God. Jamie capital. And I think it's one of the first images that have. Look at that photo of the capital. Yeah. I was cruising past and I, I took a picture with a, um, with a drone at sunset and it's quite pitcher. I quite like it. Um, but you just see the amount of people packed into this tiny little space and they've just got, they've got no means to recycle, do anything about it. It's, and it's probably got a couple of decades and then it'll be all those people have to go somewhere else.

Speaker 1:          01:29:59       You know, I always feel like I want to fly over Honolulu, Honolulu. It's like so strange because the Hawaii, you know, a Wahoo, I guess it is, has a million people on it and it's not that big man. It's not that big at all. Is that it right there? You flew over and took the top photo. I think Jamie's trying to still trying to find it. I think it would actually go to scrolling or something. Some reason his instagram pages and letting me see past this last like 10 pictures I have to do. There you go. It's up on the screen now. Unless you want to bring that up. There you go. Oh Wow. Oh my God. That's insane. It's insane, isn't it? Like how do people think this is sustainable? Like let's just build a massive city on a tiny little island with no food.

Speaker 1:          01:30:40       There's no food. Everything's important. They had a water crisis. I think it was last year. They had to import all. If all the water. This is on your instagram that people could see that visit. There's a shot on the instagram, so that's. That's chaotic. It seems like one of the worst engineered civilizations ever and so there's no what we're looking at folks with the people that are just listening to this, which is most of the people we're looking at like a small island, not very big because you can see the entire thing and it's filled with buildings. There's no nothing but buildings. It doesn't agree with any parks in there. I mean there's like a few field or something like patches of green, like very small, but most of it is just stacked buildings. Yeah, I mean it brings. Whenever I look at this, I just think of suburbia, same thing, like we all live in these little patches of land that if we wanted to grow her own food, we couldn't support ourselves. We couldn't support anything. Well, this is an argument for the asshole that used to run Australia. Right? The guy had it, right? Yeah. Don't let everybody come and ruin your beautiful party. You guys have a beautiful party. You have a continental United States with as many people as Los Angeles. Yep. But you have some spots where you can't really live. Right. That's what I mean. The whole interior is his death. Livable people have massive out there. Well, China

Speaker 2:          01:32:00       owns massive ranchers out there. China does. That's a good one to bring up, Jamie, where there's a map of Australia and Chinese ownership. It's crazy. It's crazy. We have sold. We've sold a huge farms, these massive, massive farms in central Australia to China over the last five years or so. One of the farms growing cattle, whatever it mainly, mainly it's kind of a livestock. And are these Chinese folks taking these cattle and importing the beef in China or like most of it will go straight to China basically. Wow. So they just decided to buy some land and grow some cows in a new spot. Well we were already growing cows there, but yeah, they just bought them and then export them to China. But the just the sheer area is what's crazy. I'm looking for pictures of the thing. But this is a block the size of an Ohio sized ranch that's just the latest one block the sale of a massive private cattle ranch to foreign buyer saying it was contrary to the national interest.

Speaker 2:          01:33:01       Mm. Well I mean like it. On one hand you'd say, well hey that's, that's Zena phobic and it's awful and why would you do that? But if you want to keep it the way it is, it's really no other way. Right. I just think, you know, the, at the moment we as an Australian people, we don't get any real benefit from that. We don't the profits go overseas or the product produce goes overseas. We're not really seeing any benefit for it. And that's, you know, if we, if we didn't sell it, if we leased it, completely agree at least that stuff, whatever, you know, but we should, the Australian people should retain ownership of that because I mean if ever do find the map, it's of course the colors and red to make it scary. And then it's a lot of Australia, a billionaire buys $47,000,000 worth of Australian cattle ranches to feed China's hunger for beef.

Speaker 2:          01:33:54       China's nuts. What a crazy place. It's uh, it's interesting. Definitely. Yeah. Well it's, it's, it's, I mean again, the different styles of culture that we find the different styles of the way human beings exist and coexist on this planet as one of the weirder aspects of traveling that you see what's normal to these people. Oh, it's different. Every country you could everywhere and they accept it. It's like this is our normal. What I like about China is that when it makes the decision on something, it's looking 40 years in the future because it's by committee. You know, when we in Australia or the states, you know, we make a decision based on the election cycle. It's based in what can we get four years time and that's where I think China will actually leapfrog a lot of western society because what they're doing now is thinking about in 40 years time. So they're building big infrastructure before it's even required. Where we in the Western world seem to just have crumbling infrastructure. Yeah. Yeah. We seem to be looking

Speaker 3:          01:34:58       like for years we looked like election cycles. Your elections, crazy luck in your election. Goes on for like two years in Australia, that guy we're going to have an election in 30 days time. They'd go back and forth for 30 days. We have an election, 30 days. That's it. Problem solved. We had to stare at the people for Awhile, chip away at their armor, try to find out what the fuck came for like two years. I mean that's just. Yeah, it's messed up. It is messed up. Well, it's also nobody really that you would want to be president wants to be president, you know? Ideally you would want. So why is that? Well, because they dig into your personal life too much, man. They, they start fucking with your family. You start fucking with your finances and fucking with. They started interviewing people you went to high school with and trying to chip away at any one possible moral issue you may or may not have had that they can blow up and sticking your face and you're down to these like you get like egomaniacs, like trump or massively religious people like Ted Cruz and Ben Carson.

Speaker 3:          01:35:58       This is, and I don't understand Marco Rubio, he's, he's, he's an odd one. And then you get Hillary Clinton who is essentially a lifelong politician who has been so deeply embedded into the system that she isn't a massively low trust rate. Like the truck, the wrist, it's like 37 percent of people trust her. This is crazy. I mean that's crazy. Sixty three percent of like no fucking way. The vast majority, you know, the obvious majority at least are. They're like, I don't trust her at all. And then they, you know, they have to. So we have to see Joe Rogan for prison. No fucking way. I wouldn't want that job. It's. It's a terrible job. Like it's a thing. First of all, what I honestly believe is that the idea is massively archaic and I think the idea of having this one alpha primate that runs the tribe was fine if there's 100 people, but the idea of 300 million people being run by this one figurehead is nuts.

Speaker 3:          01:36:56       It doesn't work anymore. It's stupid. What we should have is the president should be like the queen of England. Some goofball gets out and fucking bulletproof popemobile and drives around a waves. No one gives a shit, but she doesn't really dictate policy and I think the real president should be the internet. I really believe firmly that with education and with access to information that we're all enjoying right now, that maybe not now because we're in this sort of tumultuous turmoil filled adolescent period, but I think that as we get more and more deeply embedded in the idea of exchanging information, I think we're going to be able to read each other's minds. We're going to be able to tap into instantaneous information directly to our mind and we're going to realize that the only way this is all going to work out is if we don't allow anyone to abuse the environment for the sake of profit, that we don't allow anyone to take life for the sake of profit, that we don't allow anyone to lie to us about their motives for invading countries or for for dictating certain policy and especially for influencing other countries in the fall for the reason of profit.

Speaker 3:          01:38:11       We've got to. We've got to stop that. We got to figure out a way to stop that and the only way to stop that is full disclosure amongst our leader and his parents. Massive transparency and I think that's going to happen in a natural way because I think it's going to be unavoidable. I think in the future, like what you're seeing now. I think one of the reasons why you've seen this poor group of people running for president is because the really rich and influential people that maybe would have run for president 20 or 30 years ago. I like fuck that job because it's just too invasive and not only that, once you become president, you have to have secret service live with you for the rest of your life. I mean you're constantly on guard. Everywhere you go. People hate you. I mean it's, it's a crazy nut job.

Speaker 3:          01:38:53       It's a job. It's almost like a, you want it just because it's like this thing to achieve and then. But you, if you look at it on paper, like what, what is. It's not like you're independently wealthy. Once you get in, you really make you make very good money for the average person you make. Like I think it's like 450 or $500,000 a year. You know, you certainly a good living, but that's not like stuff with it. It's not worth it then, but they make money in the speeches. That's really, that's also the really weird thing you find out like how much Bill Clinton makes. Giving speeches now. It's almost like they bribe you, like for, for what your policies were in office. It's sort of as only as sort of unwritten rule like do the right thing when you're in and then when you're out, we'll have you come by.

Speaker 2:          01:39:43       If this company to this then

Speaker 3:          01:39:45       have you seen the democratic debates between Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton where he asks her for these transcripts? Oh, good for you. You probably live in better to what does this 150, $3,000,000 in bill and Hillary Clinton speaking. Mrs Clinton was paid directly by Wall Street suggesting a conflict of interest. Despite a recent distancing, no matter how much Mrs Clinton hopes to lure Bernie Sanders voters, it must be hard at $220,000 to 200, $5,000 a pop. That's how much he gets paid for a speech and he was like, it must have been an amazing speech. I'd like to see the transcript to this beach. She ain't and she not releasing those.

Speaker 2:          01:40:27       I've got a bit of trouble for saying this about a year ago. I honestly think the whole trump candidacy is a conspiracy theory to make hillary win because you have someone so crazy on that side that people go, all right, okay. Yeah, we've had our fun, but time to get serious and they go for Hillary because it's the better option of the two man where I don't fully agree with that too. The truth. I don't think Hillary's a wonder. I wonder, but I've got to. I've got to start for you, Jay. Okay. On that trip to Easter island. So we went from Tahiti to Easter island for about two weeks ago and we had um, had a gentleman on board who was kind of my political hero. Uh, his name was Bob Brown, Australian, a senator, leader of the Green Party. And so when I was growing up, you'd have your talking heads, some topic coming on and you'd have basically the Republican and the Democrat, we call them liberals and labor, whatever.

Speaker 2:          01:41:21       And it would be stupid comment, stupid comment. And then you'd have this third one, the Greens guy. He would come on and then just say something that actually made sense. And so the whole time growing up, he was a bit of a political hero of mine, nothing worship or anything like that. But I went, you know, out of all the politicians, this guy's got his head screwed on and it's environmentally and progressive and stuff like that. Environmentally conscious. So he was on board is one of our guests lecturers kind of thing. And he did lots of talks, um, fascinating, fascinating guy. And I remember I did my climate change talk and so he came up to me afterwards and I hadn't had a long conversation with you. And so I went to, you know, start going, oh, big fan, Yada Yada. And he turned around and when you add them, you, you need to be in politics, you need to be a senator for the Greens in Australia.

Speaker 2:          01:42:05       And he pushed it big time especially, you've got to do this, you've got to do this. We need, you know, younger people like you to do. And I must admit, I thought about it because I want to not change the world, but I want to do something to make this earth a slightly better than what I arrived. Um, and that's a way to do it for sure. The thing that keeps me back from doing it is I would have to put up with politicians all day who would want to put up with politicians, order. That's what I'm miserable bunch of people and I don't know, but I haven't watched much cspan of Congress and stuff over here. But our parliament, they just sit there pitching each other continuously, if that's totally true. It's like the English parliament and ever seen where they'd just be using each other basically and yelling, calling each other names all the time when they have a vote and they don't, they, they know the vote's not going to go their way.

Speaker 2:          01:42:52       You didn't have to have like 60 percent of the people there to make the vote count. They all run for the doors and try and get out before they lock the doors so that there's not enough people that actually actually make it past. They just act like little school children kind of run. They run. Our prime minister is sprinting because I go to. The doors are going to be locked in two minutes and he's Brinton out of his seat to get out that door because we get to that that door. Then he doesn't vote and there's not enough votes and then it doesn't go through. It's just like we paying these people to represent us and they're just acting like little children or goofy law. Why would you want to. Why would you want to surround yourself? Imagine waking up everyday and surrounding yourself with that.

Speaker 3:          01:43:27       I think we'd be way better off if individual human beings across the board, like the giant mass of us, if we all, everyone adult had a say instead of an elected government, a representative government. If we all had to say and we we'd have to come up with one zero. A real. Exactly. That's a great way of pointing it out. I think the representative government was great idea back in the day when it was impossible to communicate with each other. We don't need it anymore. We don't need it.

Speaker 2:          01:43:56       Two point zero. There was a gentleman potty, they. They tried to do it and you know that were quite successful but didn't get elected into power so it couldn't do it, but their idea was to use two point zero. We just make a website and you've got whatever issue we're voting on. Everyone can vote and and where I think they went wrong because this is something I've thought about quite considerably is where they went wrong is they're trying to change the whole system. So the gun, we're going to come in, we're gonna change the whole system and people freak out. Then of course, so I feel it. Hang on. Is there a way to achieve the same goal but through the nonprofit angle instead of trying to change the whole thing, and so it's something I started on, I started working on and it's been put to the sidelines because I travel the world and I'm busy, but earth vote.network where you had a place where you could go and vote like a petition, but it's that one question that you answer stays on forever and so then because in Australia all the time you pick up a Murdoch newspaper and it'll say 94 percent of Australians think this and then you read down the bottom out of a survey of a 500 people ringing landlines in one suburb in Sydney.

Speaker 2:          01:44:59       I'm like, that's not a representation of what's going on. Imagine if I could turn around and go, here's half a million people and he is the percentage of what they think. Then you're getting a more accurate representation of what's going on. I think there's room for a website like that and obviously I've kind of given up on doing it myself, hence why I'm mentioning it right now. Hopefully someone else takes it up, but there's huge potential in taking clicktivism, which we currently see on facebook and everything. Everyone's happy to click on a link and spread the good word about some environmental concern, but actually do something they're not so willing to do. If you collate all that clicktivism into one spot and then you have data coming out of it, it actually becomes useful with actually can be used where you can go to a politician, say, hey, 80 percent of your electric think this so your represent them.

Speaker 2:          01:45:45       Go do it and you've got some way. And then the other aspect to it is to then actually do a kind of vote, not voting. Um, keep a system of the politicians. So say 80 percent of Australia thinks this things and then the politician, the votes for a bill that's against that. Then you give them a minus one point, they vote for it, you get an a plus one point, you know. And so eventually you would work out basically which politicians are accurately representing their constituents and which ones are not. And that's what we don't have. How do you know that this guy that you're voting for has been representing the constituents? You don't really know. You've got to go back and look through 10 years of newspaper articles and try and deduce it. Imagine if you could formulate that into a website, you. It'd be a pretty powerful thing.

Speaker 3:          01:46:30       It'd be a very powerful thing. I think that's the future. I think the future, as we were saying, as we get more access to, you know, the way people are influenced, when we understand where the money's actually coming from, which is way more today than it's ever been in the past 30, 40 years ago. It was really difficult to out what was motivating certain presidents or people that were candidates and you only got to see what they were projecting in front of the television what they were. That's why debates are important. You get to see the way they spoke and debates. Try to decipher and peel through it, but no, we never had the kind of transparency that we have today and this is

Speaker 1:          01:47:06       you want to know what's really going on with a politician. Get them on the Joe Rogan podcast, get politician for three hours. They accomplish it for that long. That would be at some point you would get under them and you would find out what's actually going to do. A lot of research though that, so I couldn't just have mom like you and just go, let's talk man. I would have to go deep, but yeah,

Speaker 3:          01:47:26       you get someone to talk for long periods of time uncensored like that. Without commercial breaks, without moderators. Then you're going to get to see him. These debates that they have are so ridiculous. One person says something ridiculous to see Bernie Sanders raising his hand when he disagrees, waiting to have his turn and then she's talking over and then he talks over and you're running out of time, but let me finish my point. And he goes, oh, it's like the, the, the method of distributing information is archaic. It's not necessary anymore. You know, they should, they should have some sort of a free form, free form conversation. It's available online where people can watch it and you know, you have someone who was entertaining that understands politics, run them through it and just give some sort of a, a real detailed view to the American people of who these people are and what they're about, but I think they're the people that are today.

Speaker 3:          01:48:19       Even Bernie Sanders who's a really revolutionary and a lot of ways and very progressive in a lot of ways. There's still a politician, you know, he's still wearing a tie and a suit and all that nonsense and he's still a part of this weird system and he always has been, even though he's a rebel in a lot of ways, but I think they're going to be like those people that are wearing powdered wigs and those ancient pictures. It's like it's so old. It's so crazy. Like this method of doing it, like you have to do it this way.

Speaker 1:          01:48:45       Lawyers in Australia as to where those weeks do they really? Yeah. It's crazy what? Yep. When you do it's magic. So if you go to court, you have to wear a wig. The lawyer in certain certain quotes. So if you got in trouble for something that the defendant doesn't have to know, but I'm saying your lawyer, like what the fuck am I looking at, Jamie? That's a Barista. Okay. So for you guys got to get on the fucking ball. You guys are crazy. So sorry to interject. But I did. So if you get in trouble, if you did something, if you got accused of something and you hired a lawyer, your lawyer would have to wear a wacky wig like that. Yes. Wow. Sit in certain courts. What courts? Oh, now you're stretching my memory on it. A lot of them think it's, it's not a magistrate, a barrister. Um, yeah, something like that. Good Lord. Definitely New South Wales and some of them. Yeah. I actually, I went to court for the first time

Speaker 2:          01:49:48       last year. First time for what? Uh, I got a charged with being a terrorist. You did for something environmental? I would imagine not. What'd you do? I uh, I went through airport security with a pocket knife by accident. Oh my God. Yeah. We in Australia. We're a bit of a nanny state at the moment. Uh, we've brought in a lot of laws that just ridiculous and so it used to be you go through airport security with your Swiss army knife, they take it off you and they go right in a way you go, you know, that's it. They changed the law two weeks before I went through and it was just, it was just a random mistake. I had a pocket knife in with the camera gear. I had to rearrange my bank because I was overweight. Um, and I put it in my carry on by mistake.

Speaker 2:          01:50:34       I didn't realize that pocket knife is, it's simple mistake. We do it all the time and people do it all the time. And uh, yeah, so they got it and I was like, oh crap, because it's a good knife. I was like, oh, well, whatever. I'm late for my flight. And then I went to walk away and they went, oh, hang on here when the Australian Federal Police need to speak to you. I'm like, oh my God. So the police came over and they were, they were trying to give me off on a course and they were ringing their superior and trying to get me caught because I could see clear as day that is just stupid mistake. And the supplier said, no, no, that's the laws change, they have to go to court now. And so I was charged with possession of a deadly weapon basically with intent to hijack and aircraft and it cost me thousands of dollars because it wasn't the airport I got done.

Speaker 2:          01:51:18       It was about 2000 kilometers away from where I live. So I had to travel back there and then I had to get a lawyer, which was just hilarious. I pay a thousand dollars. He didn't even show up. He sent someone else, gave me a call half an hour beforehand. Um, yeah, everything was just like. And so I was, I knew more about the law than he did. But anyway. And so then the substitute lawyer? Yeah. Oh God. I knew more about the actual legislation. I was getting challenged and basically I got the legislation has no difference between a bazooka and a in a pocket knife that the same thing. Ak Forty seven and it's the same thing in the. You kill somebody with it. If. So it's the same thing. It's the same thing. If I try to get through airport security with a bazooka, I'd be under the same legislation and under the same thing.

Speaker 2:          01:52:00       And so I got off lightly instead of get used in jail. Um, because obviously first offense, no, no prior record or that sort of stuff. I got a, there's a fancy word for it. I want to say indentured servitude, but that's not it. It's like a good behavior bond. So I got four for the next year. As long as you don't break any more laws, then that conviction will disappear basically. Wow. But yeah, I went to court, charged with being a terrorist for bloody pocket knife and that's when I must have been after that. I was trying to think. I didn't really want to live in Australia anymore because it's just gotten a bit too crazy. Do you think that's the same sort of a momentum that's behind, like getting rid of the immigrants and shipping them off to new places and putting people in jail for reporting on it?

Speaker 2:          01:52:40       Least have some thing, Patriot Act where they bring in a law that does all this sort of stuff and they don't debate. It just goes instantly through and no one even reads the law of what's going through and we had this whole. It was so staged if so easily you could see was staged where they had. We've arrested 20 terrorists in Sydney now. They actually had to let them all go because they didn't have anything on anyone but they filmed it and it was on national news of them writing all these places and then immediately brought in a week later, new laws and that no one debated. No one even written brought him in and one of those laws were, yeah, you take a pocket knife through airport security. You have to go to court to defend yourself. That's such a stupid.

Speaker 3:          01:53:17       With law, I mean the United States laws which are pretty strict or nothing like that. I went through security accidentally with a pocketknife they just took, it

Speaker 2:          01:53:25       was a, everyone does this, but I, I just spend 3000, $4,000, million money and try and work this out that way and now to this day, whenever I travel my bags, if I have a short short transit, my bags went make it because they get searched every single a protocol on the list. I just spent three weeks in Antarctica with no luggage. It never, it never arrived. Oh Christ. Because it went through extra security in and then didn't arrive for a couple of days and I was already down in Antarctica

Speaker 3:          01:53:57       just because of a pocket knife just because of a pocket knife. Yeah, in America. I went through it in Denver. I had a backpack and the backpack in one of the small pockets that are very small knife in it and they sent me through secondary screening was I think you got a pocket knife in your backpack or sorry, the guy took it and that was it. Yeah, take it easy. Okay, bye. Done. That's what it's always been locked, but they changed the law. That's so crazy. That doesn't make any sense at all. It's just, it's a waste of my money. It's a waste of the court's money. What do you think they're doing it to try to make more money by making more court cases? Well, I had to pay the court costs.

Speaker 2:          01:54:34       I mean obviously, but I, I just think it's Laura upon laws in Australia, we are shocking at laws upon laws and laws. No one speeds in Australia. I drove down from San Francisco yesterday and it was ludicrous how fast people would drive the speed limit because the speed that they were driving like 40 k's over the speed limit is something that in Australia is you lose your license instantly. You don't have a license for the next year, so really? Yeah. So no one's speeds like that for a year. Oh God. So yeah. But that's because we just have so many laws. We just have so many different laws in that respect.

Speaker 3:          01:55:11       That's disturbing. But that's not what I wanted to talk to you about. Men bumming me out about Australia. I was thinking about moving to Australia. I'm like, maybe that's the spot. I've heard that a lot from the American since trump is doing his thing. No, it's not because of that. I just think I just like it. I mean I wouldn't really move there, but like if the shit hit the fan, someone blew up Manhattan or something like that. I'm like, Ooh, time of jolt or bolt, whatever, whatever it is.

Speaker 2:          01:55:34       That's an interesting one. Where I was for nine slash 11. Where were you? I was in up in the very northern reaches of Australia in the middle of nowhere.

Speaker 1:          01:55:44       I'm so far away that you couldn't get any signal for anything, but one of the people on board had a shortwave radio, like a ham radio and so I learned of nine slash 11 via radio and it was like war of the worlds man. It sounded like the whole world was going to shine and. But we were on a boat in the middle of nowhere and we did kind of just all looked at each other and go, well we got two or three months supply of food here. We can stretch that out with fishing and we're in the middle of nowhere. We can go sit up that creek over there and yeah, we were kind of pretty bugged out. It wasn't until about two months later they actually got back and saw the images of what happened. But it sounds like war of the worlds when you listened to that sort of event over a radio, it was scary.

Speaker 1:          01:56:25       That's a weird way to get information to. So, so like retro, you know, to get information about some sort of a gigantic catastrophe or calamity horrendous event. Like nine slash 11 to get an over radio, like just, it sounded like world war three. That's what it sounded like from the radio at least. Yeah. It's like, well it looked like world war three on tv that day too though, in all fairness. I remember watching on TV and went with a bunch of my friends because there was no flights. I had some gigs planned. I couldn't go. So actually supposed to be in Manhattan that week. Lucky. Yeah. Um, I was supposed to fly to Manhattan the week after September 11 that all flights were canceled and I remember hanging out with some friends in La and everyone was bugging out like why is going to happen? And then we were aware because of the news that there was no flights and it was a beautiful, clear skies.

Speaker 1:          01:57:24       It was strange, strange. Hey, look up like there's no, no airplanes. Yeah, just nothing. You don't hear him. You look up, you don't see any. I think it was some of the clear skies ever recorded over the USA. Everything. Yeah. Well, not only that, the temperature lowered changed the temperature of the earth or maybe raised, I forget one of the water vapor. It would've lowered. Yeah, it would've got a little bit cool. Is that what it is? Because things happened and we'll either raised or lowered depending upon the. There was also the water vapor could protect the atmosphere and a lot because it's like cloud cover, you know, when you get contrary contracts on which one it was, but it was like a noticeable amount that it changed a CEO to an airplane's pumping out. It's nothing too serious. This is one of the most efficient forms of transport you can have put person, but where it's injecting that CEO too and that water vapor up in that, you know, in the high atmosphere it's, it's doing some damage.

Speaker 1:          01:58:18       It is not as much as I think we give it credit for. Well the other thing is people that live near airports suffer some sick. What does that. Jamie would just put up. It got hotter actually. Yeah. Did two degrees hotter. Yeah. That's what I was thinking because I think is the lack of. Because those trails that are created, the artificial clouds that are by jet engines naturally stirring up the humidity. Maybe they're reflecting back solar radiation. Well that's where all the chem trail craziness comes from. The geoengineering people, they believe that that is actually done on purpose and then what we're doing is we're, we're making artificial clouds try to control the environment. Well, it's not true. I mean we know why those things are made. They're made. It's a natural formation that happens when you have a jet engine passes through condensation. It creates contract is not chem trails.

Speaker 1:          01:59:12       I always try and point that one out. It's a, there's a guy named Mick West who runs this website called Metta bunk and just sort of debunks a lot of like really commonly held ideas that conspiracy theories tend to grab onto, but he calls it the training wheels of conspiracy theories because it's like in the sky above your head. Like what is that? And they're like, we've got to get to the bottom of this, you know, and that's sort of where instead of like researching what actually happens with jet engines and condensation and it on, people say, well, how come one day there'll be no cantrell's and another dude will be a lot. Well, how come one day it rains and the other day it doesn't really fit you really well. It's condensation and it's how the amount of moisture in the atmosphere. It's whatever. This is a different subject.

Speaker 1:          01:59:53       Um, I wanted to talk to you about some other shit that you had on your, um, you had a neurological decompression illness from you. You're trying to give a happy here, but this is actually getting sad. Well this is scary. Yeah, it's, it's a story. I was hoping you're going to do another one. Oh really? And it's certainly we can do that. We don't have to. I want to tell you it's just, it's a depressing, depressing what happened. So I'm scuba diving, scuba diving since I was 12 years old, a $13,000. I'm asking a lot of time underwater. Whoa. And uh, so one light sites inevitable. I don't know. But uh, so I was diving nothing too serious, you know, a shallow dive. It was a bit of a car and I was turning into a bit of a current, maybe slightly dehydrated, who knows?

Speaker 1:          02:00:38       Um, but yeah, I got messed up now. I've been diving for nine days prior to that full dives a day, so I'd had some residual nitrogen. I've got bubbles in my blood basically, and then doing this one, I guess a little bit of exertion underwater and stuff like that. Yeah, I got messed up. So when I came out of the water you have a bad headache and stuff like that. And then um, eventually I was looking down at my hands and my hands had gone into Phis and I couldn't open my hands anymore. And that to me was the big thing straight away I was like, Whoa, I've never had that before where I didn't have control of my buddy, you know. And so my hands were world class, so I ran upstairs to my bunk, told the first night, you know, get the oxygen and stuff like that. I've got something's going wrong here. And then when I laid down in my bunk, I just severe pain going over the whole entire body. Arms enhance both totally paralyzed. Couldn't move them enormous, enormous amount of pain. A box jellyfish pain or no, no, no. Nothing near that. I think more discussion

Speaker 2:          02:01:43       paying because you just don't know what's going on, you know, you just don't know. Your whole body is just suddenly doing stuff that it's never done before. Um, and so when an oxygen and ended up passing out actually after a few, maybe half an hour. So I ended up passing out and then woke up and I was just really dopey and doughy and stuff. And long story short, um, for various reasons I didn't actually get treatment for about six days. It was very remote area in this. There's all this stuff there and uh, and then I spent nine days in a chamber decompression chamber basically to try and try and repair what had gone wrong because I had nerve damage in the hands and feet, spine and brain. So I had quite a significant brand damage. Um, the spine damage, the spine causes a lot of fatigue and things like that. And then the hands and feet just pain basically. Um, yeah, that happened in 2012.

Speaker 1:          02:02:43       I got messed up, messed up. So brain damage, like what kind of brain damage? A literally brain damage. So what's going on in my body is lots of little tiny bubbles basically are all nerves, bloodstream everywhere, and they cause inflammation and they, they kill stuff. I had a lot of muscle atrophy, you know, I had a lot of muscles just die on me cause they, their blood supply had been blocked by these little bubbles going around. Do you see like a difference in your body to turn black and blue or does it shrink? Like what you, you lose your, all your muscle mass, just shrivels you lose your muscle mass. It changed the appearance of the skin. Like does it seem like yellowing where it's rotting underneath or anything? Nothing like that. Um, I had to learn how to walk again. I could barely walk and I had to learn.

Speaker 1:          02:03:27       Vocabulary was a hard one. I said we're really good vocabulary now. Not so much anymore. I, I killed a lot of brain cells. Brain cells, you feel stupid. Or I had, I tested my Iq beforehand and I was about 150, 160 marketing and now I'm about 120. So you're still a fucking genius. I wouldn't go that far, but some Iq points. That's. Well, you used to be a genius for sure. I'm a photographic memory. I won 51. Sixty is definitely a genius. I thought too much. Basically it's better for you to feel a little stupid. Well, I enjoy bad movies now. There you go. Yeah, because Adam Sandler movies, so like reese witherspoon movie, any movie this predictable where before I'd be like, I know it was legally blonde to watch that over and over again. Any of these movies and that's it. But I appreciate bad movies.

Speaker 1:          02:04:20       There's always a. there's always a positive side to everything. So do you really? It's so it actually made you significantly less intelligent and you can consume pop culture now. Yeah. Basically. Do you enjoy reality shows now that Beverly Hills housewife? My TV at home as an isn't actually connected to an area little. Oh, you're one of those guys. I don't like advertising. I think advertising is evil. So you use like Netflix or something like that? Well that's smart. That's the future anyway, right? You're ahead of the ball. Anything goods on itunes already, you know, most of the good shows in a walking dead or game of thrones or anything like that. You could always find them, well I want to choose my own schedule as well. I don't want to be, oh, Wednesday night and I have to stay in because I want to watch that one show.

Speaker 1:          02:05:02       Like my kids don't know what commercials are really. They don't understand it and most of the time we watch shows with them. We watched on Dvr and you could fast forward through commercials, but occasionally we'll watch like one of their favorite shows and it'll come on and they'll watch it while it's on and then the show will be on and then it'll go to commercial and they reach for the remote and it's like, don't. It's not letting them fast forward and like what is going on here? Like why do we have to watch this? I'm like, well that's a commercial. That's it. That's how it normally is. Welcome to what we had to deal with, but the look on their little faces when you see a little look on like a five or six year old's face, we were like, what the fuck you I have to.

Speaker 1:          02:05:41       I have to watch this stupid thing. And they're watching these commercials like, like puzzled, like who? Like even a child realizes this is a dumb way to advertise. Advertise things. Yeah. It's, it's actually, I think it makes you not want to purchase those things. They've interrupted your program, but that's because you're intelligent. I would say it does work for a vast majority of people who don't, you know, it's just subliminal than not even thinking about it, but it just goes in, Hey, I want to cook. Don't you think it works less and less though. Possibly as we get disassociated with it, with Netflix and stuff like that as we move away from it. But I think, I think advertising is evil. Haven't seen the south park related sandbox. I go onto it quite well, but advertising, yeah, I see why it's there, but yeah, it really bugs me and it bugs me probably also because in Australia we have such terrible ads.

Speaker 1:          02:06:36       We had Chris Bell and Mark Bell from the documentary, bigger, stronger, faster and the new one, prescription thugs where they go over the effect of the prescription drug industry and what massive influence it has on people and the amount of people that are hooked on pain pills and whatnot. It was bands in Australia by the way. They should be and they were talking in the documentary about during the Reagan administration when they became legal and they started advertising for all these drugs and how how much different the landscape changed when all of a sudden there was an ad then showed you all these things that may be you have an issue and maybe you should talk to your doctor about this stuff, and then you know the sales go through the roof. They get addicted to that money that comes from no sales. It's a really disturbing aspect of our society that you can advertise for drugs like prescription. How many pharmaceuticals, how many different drugs and American an average American is on at any one point? When I was in the dive industry as a supervisor, I would get lists of everyone on board

Speaker 2:          02:07:36       and their medical conditions and what drugs that are currently taking and Australian. It's just like, oh, Yep, yep. Nothing, nothing bump and American that have five or six things listed there, and then I would have to actually go do the research on each drug and see if they conflicted with diving and stuff like that. It was a lot of work and you kind of like, oh, this is an upper and this is a downer and this is a kind of level or well, people of antidepressants and they have an extra abilify that they add to an antidepressant. If that antidepressant isn't doing the job, but it could cause society a society to collapse and your asshole explodes and you bleed out and some side effects may have suicidal thoughts. It's apparently like there's a lot attached to it, like the fine print at the end when they scroll through it and may cause Mama, it's like this huge list of possibilities that could go horribly wrong, but some people they just always think that a pill is the answer and I think that's also part of the programming that's sort of been in diamond.

Speaker 2:          02:08:37       I'm in a really tough spot this point in the last few years basically because I've always believed, don't take a pill for the rest of you, like take. You've got a headache, you take a headache pill route, but you don't take a pill every single day of your life. There's no point for that. Or you have something like diabetes or something right to shop. There's always some exceptions there, but lo and behold, most people can actually with diabetes even changed their diet and sort of go that way. There are ways to do without taking a pill every day, but now I'm under this thing where since that accident with decompression sickness, I have pain constantly in pain constantly. What you're hiding it very well. Well, what do you do with your life? You just cry. Go over there and cry. I'll hide in the corner. But what are you gonna do?

Speaker 2:          02:09:20       Like what kind of pain is it like you're in right now? Hands and feet. Basically the hands and feet are throbbing or aching. Stabbing pain feels like someone's got a need right now and have a stabbing pain in your hands and feet and you just become accustomed to. Yeah. Wow. Yeah. It's all the nerve damage as you looked into hypobaric hyperbaric chambers or nine days straight after it happened to barrick chambers. So I did nine days in hyperbaric chambers. Looked into continue therapy with that. Um, it's not something that'll. Let me tell you. I would have to go pay for it myself. Yes. I'd have to pay thousands of dollars to go get oxygen therapy for like, football is football. Let's go do it. So they heal quicker. If you actually talked to a doctor that would say it probably wouldn't do much because you do it after the event and that.

Speaker 2:          02:10:06       But now we're talking four years later and they're like, eh, probably wouldn't do much. But there's not a lot of. The problem with decompression sickness is there's not a lot of evidence. There's not a lot of research. There is a holy per research, but it's classified by the US marines, US Navy, most of the evidence and most of the stuff out there, it's very, there's not a lot of data. And so I remember going to these doctors and they're like, we don't really know. How do you go? There's no set plan. Oh, you get decompression sickness. Where do we go from here to, to fix it? There isn't that kind of, oh, we'll try this, we'll try this drug, we'll try this, we'll try this drug and we'll just keep trying different drugs and see what happens basically. Whoa. I've tried a lot of drugs in the last 40 years.

Speaker 2:          02:10:46       What has offered you the most relief? Um, I'll get in trouble for saying it. But a acupuncture was actually with it. You get in trouble for saying that. The anti acupuncture lobby, basically I had to find some guy who, who kind of did it. He was a doctor and then he did acupuncture as we call it, bulk billing is part of the government sort of thing so I could get it. Um, so I did that and that reduced my pain by about half a straight afterwards. Yeah, huge thing. The other drugs I tried. Oh God, um, I mean the names we'll kind of mix over here. So think the first thing they did is they check you on any presence, Cymbalta, that sort of stuff. Um, because they're like, well, he's just having trouble adjusting to the fact that he's in pain all the time, so let's give me an antidepressant. So he's happy, which it does take the edge off, but it's a kind of half against it. But B, it just, you just had to keep upping the dose, you know, you started from 10 milligrams and then in a month's time it wouldn't do anything anymore. You Go to 20 and you just keep upping the dose and so you just become accustomed to the dosage because it's not taking the pain away. It's just taking the edge off, you know, making it, not think about it. So much

Speaker 3:          02:11:54       one of the reasons why a friend of mine got off of them, he said, you, he realized like you're going to get adapted to whatever dose they give you and then they're going to come up with some. Well, this isn't working anymore because your body's accustomed to it. You built up a tolerance. So we're gonna try a new SSRI on you. Yeah, yeah.

Speaker 2:          02:12:10       I eventually got off the Cymbalta because it was just, I was getting to basically the depressive dosage. I was getting up to 60 milligrams or something and so I was like, well, I don't want to keep going with this. And quite frankly it's not doing much. So I got off that and they put me on one court Lyrica, which has an epileptic drug. Jesus, um, I've tried a lot of drugs and air that just mess with me, mess with my head. I had to quit it because I was going to lose my job because I just didn't turn up to work anymore. I would sleep through my alarms and wake up four or five hours later and dislike it just missed with me and I was captain of the ship at the time. So I'm like, I can't be driving this ship. I can't be in charge of all these people and being messed up on some epileptic drugs.

Speaker 2:          02:12:52       So I stopped doing that one. Then what I try after that, uh, in depth, which is a, it's a, any depressant from the sixties I believe it's not used at all anymore, but there's no evidence. There's like, oh, we have like 10 drugs here that sends some experiments experimenting on you. And so I've been on that one for a while. The same thing I just kept getting, well the first time I took it I actually slept for about 20 hours straight. It just messed me up. So I've been kind of very low doses of it and once again it just stopped. Not really doing much for the pain. And then I said, I've just spent three weeks in the Antarctic with no bags, which means no medication either. So actually spent three weeks without it. And I noticed straight away I had more energy during the day.

Speaker 2:          02:13:35       It actually caused me to be fatigued for the morning, um, and I don't have that anymore. And the level of pain tolerance that it was giving me was just insignificant. So now I'm just back to popping a pill when it gets too much at night. Uh, at the moment, coating pan, we call it Panadeine Forte, which is a paracetamal and a small dose according to just try to get some sleep. Yeah, just to the insomnia. You get insomnia from all the pain. So that's what I try and do. Um, yeah, they, the next one they wanted me to try with methadone. I know that one yet. Jesus Christ, that's what they do to get people off of heroin. That's just a Guinea pig. They just keep experimenting with me. Fuck man. That's, that seems so crazy. Well, hopefully people will listen to this, that have some information though.

Speaker 2:          02:14:23       I'm open to ideas. I hope they do reach out to you. Um, you had pirates in here as a subject to bring up. Did you have any experience with pirate? I'm know Tom Hanks movie. No, no, I just used to do a talk on it. We did a through, you know, sort of not past Somalia but Tanzania, Maldives, Seychelles around that whole area. So a lot of people want to talk about policy. So I have a little presentation that I kind of did on piracy in there, but what I quite liked to show people is actually I liked bringing new technology into the equation. So there's a website called live piracy map, and you can actually see a map of, of the world and all the current pirate attacks around the world. It's pretty cool. Was that something to be concerned with when you're driving around that big hundred million dollar beautiful boat?

Speaker 2:          02:15:11       No, not at all. No. Do you guys have security with you? No, not at all. We fucked up saying that. She'd say, yeah, armed to the teeth superhero. If I told you I'd have to kill. You know what? Pirates attack a cargo ship. Something with very little crew, 10 cruise, something like that. They attack something that's a big prize with very little people protecting it. They don't. Occasionally they'll go for yachts a little time and yachts that cruise ships, I think the last sort of cruise ship or big ship that they tried to attack as they came up alongside it, all guests on board grabbed all the outdoor furniture or the sun lounges and stuff like that and threw it at the people coming up in the little boats and killed some of them. Um, with furniture. The furniture there with the pirates were killed by falling furniture from the roof.

Speaker 2:          02:15:59       Um, so they just don't do it. There's how you jump on board a ship like a that I'm on and you have 100 guests and you have 80 credits, 180 people. You're going to try and manage, um, you know, kind of get away with it. Like there's the pirate map or the. Yeah. So that's the, the piracy map. So you can click on each one of those little, um, little tags and it will tell you a little story. This is all done by the insurance agencies obviously, but it's just fascinating to see what's going on and what I was trying to always show to people is that people always go Somali pirates. There isn't actually much piracy there anymore. Very, very little. Most of it's actually the Straits of Malacca Singapore around. They're real and most of the piracy is we're the largest shipping channels are basically.

Speaker 3:          02:16:42       Well, the Somalian story we've talked about on the podcast many times, unfortunately I don't want to reiterate it, but those people were forced into it because of people dumping toxic waste are fishermen were dumping toxic waste off their shores and they kidnap them to try to stop this dumping and then they got a massive ransom and realize like, whoa, hey, fuck fishing. Just start kidnapping people.

Speaker 2:          02:17:05       No, no one turns into a pirate or a terrorist. It's a. it's a function of where they've grown up and the experiences they've had that have pushed them to that limit. You know, you've pushed them

Speaker 3:          02:17:14       to the edge. There's always a reason for it. Well, the battle for resources and the inequality of the resources and what you can get in the world, it just leads people to desperation and that's what, you know, going back to the alien thing, that's what we would hope one day we would get past when you get past this. I mean we, we'd understand that like if we just looked at the world, I mean if somehow or another we realized that there's some sort of is a way to be completely altruistic, right? There's a way to be completely even and fair and we would look at the globe and say, well look, there's plenty of resources. We have boats and ships and let's just evenly distributed all this stuff and figure out a way we could all live in harmony and everybody contribute, but

Speaker 2:          02:17:57       it's. It's difficult with the way things are right now. It's very difficult to move into that place. We'd have to have some sort of a massive transcendence. I'd like to go more into the whole climate change thing normally before I bring this up, but at the same time I started off very optimistic. I started doing climate change talks, 2007. I was very, very optimistic that we can do this, we can do this, we can do this now. Fast forward almost 10 years later and I'm apocalyptic mystic. Yeah, it's I, I think really if we want to change what's going on now, like any problem with when adults come to you with a problem, have you tried turning it on and off? I really think we kind of. We get to the point now where we really got to turn it all off and then start it back up again in a carbon neutral kind of way.

Speaker 2:          02:18:43       That's what we're getting to right now because what we're seeing now, this is something that eludes most people. The effects we're seeing now, which is two degrees Celsius above degrees Celsius about industrial reits. The attic at the moment is 12 to 16 degrees Celsius above the average preindustrial time. All this sort of stuff going on. It's, it's, there's a 40 year lag between what we pump out in pollution and CEO to, to what the actual temperature rises. So what we're seeing now is from the mid seventies, we haven't even got up to the eighties yet. That's bananas. Yeah. You imagine what the next 10 years. The eighties. What? What the what we did to the world during the eighties.

Speaker 3:          02:19:23       When you're in Antarctica, do you look for places to move? Just say, Ooh, built a house here. Thirty years. It'd be the shit. It's. It's not too far off. No, it's actually really quite well in the Antarctic peninsula. It's a bit of a hot spot as well. It's warm. I've got a picture, I've got a picture there of me in t shirts and shorts. So you're talking this 30 degrees Celsius warmer there, which is what does that in America? In America Fair. Fair enough. Okay. So we've talked about the Arctic. The Arctic at the moment is in some areas about 12 degrees Celsius above the preindustrial levels. So God, I never go to Fahrenheit, but I would say yeah, 24, almost 30, 33 is very annoying that we have different ways of telling the temperature that is so goofy and kilograms to like when we go to England is the most ridiculous.

Speaker 3:          02:20:15       They have stone when we do weigh ins for the UFC in England with 13 stone, like what are you even talking about? Why you've met stones, like what? Thirteen pounds or something crazy like that. Some random ancient fucking king shit. Somebody had a rock and they wanted everybody to be measured by that route to put this out there. Metric system is a wonderful thing. So way to go. We should have adopted it should we tried. When I was in high school before high school, I believe, I believe junior high school, there were. There was an attempt to indoctrinate the American people on soccer and the metric system wholesale. We're like, no, we dug our heels in. No soccer. I cannot understand but a metric system. I just. I wonder like when you're in school, like trying to learn maths and science, not using the metric system.

Speaker 3:          02:21:06       That must be hard work, man. You remember all that sort of stuff. It's kind of silly because you can do, you can see the metric system is better. It's a better system. It's a system of 10. You know when you get into inches and yards and systems of 12, 12 inches and like, okay, how many yards is a. What was a meter to a yard is how much difference. Okay. Ninety meters is almost the same, but there's, there's variables and then the kilos thing, the kilograms and measuring that and Fahrenheit and Celsius. It's, it's dumb. Like one system would be great. They could have done it. They could have stuck with it in the sixties and the seventies. We could have been all right. Right now man, don't the rest of the world. We're wherever with metric system. Come join us. We're not England though. They had the stones, but they have miles. Yeah, Yup. Yeah, Yup. You sure? I'm pretty sure. I don't think these kilometers. See if England uses miles. I think these miles, I think they use inches, feet miles. Pretty sure if they use inches and feet and he was kilometers, they're retarded. No wacky. I fill it. It was you guys and a USA in Bhutan were the only people in the be looking like that. Let's see. Uh, they longed. What does it say in the UK? Miles are used almost exclusively on road signs I just used in

Speaker 1:          02:22:26       road sense. Yeah. Interesting. Interesting. Well, I'm thinking in there, not just road science. I think they also use it on their spirometers like, you know, 35 miles an hour because you. Have you ever spent Amr? I mean, they're not going to use it just on the road. Signs of their fucking car doesn't say what it is. I'm sure it's in their automobiles to tweed. Having a mixed like that isn't. It is weird. It wasn't too aware of that. Will England's not a mix. They use that. We are their system. I mean the reason why we use inches and feet, feet and all that jazz was because of them. Miles. That's, that's England. What we did too. Of course in Australia we got smart. You guys wised up. Another reason why Australia is awesome, as I said, we, we have our moments, we do. We were the second nation, let women vote.

Speaker 1:          02:23:07       We got a lot of good things behind us that being very progressive and kind of ahead of the loop on a few things, but who's the first us, New Zealand, New Zealand. The first people that people. Women vote. Yeah. Goddamn beautiful. It's a beautiful kind of. A buddy of mine was over there right now. Send me some pictures. I was like, yeah, it's a pretty place. I try and get there wherever I can. What is your favorite place to visit or do you have a favorite place you've explored? I mean, you've literally been. Because every, every expedition. I don't give me a favor. Tell me about something awesome. Every expedition I do has something amazing that we do, you know? And so every single one, there's one place that I really, really like. Um, so there's lots and yeah, it's hot. But if you were to specify specific expedition, I can tell you the highlights of it.

Speaker 1:          02:23:52       So probably one of my favorite place in the world at the moment is south Georgia, which is a, you know, the Falkland Islands, it's just over a little bit further into the, into the ocean there east. And so you've got this little tiny rock in the middle of a big ocean and all the animals have to go somewhere. So they all go to this little tiny rock. So you go on this beach, St Andrews, Bang, you've got 400,000 king penguins, you know, on this one little beach is just thick with animals and, and it had a lot of ceiling. But now the first year of coming back and so you literally get to these beaches and you kind of got to try and make your way through the penguins and the seals to actually get ashore. It's that crazy. And one of my favorite things to do there is I just laid down on the beach and all the little tiny baby first seal pups, little tiny things with bobbly heads.

Speaker 1:          02:24:39       They all come up and they pile on top of you. And it's just amazing, amazing experience to be in. Amongst so many animals that are just as inquisitive about you as they are. Yeah. There's some crazy, crazy shots there. Wow. That's so beautiful. It's a, it's a stunning spot. I've got, um, I've got some images somewhere as well. The, the perspective that you gain from visiting all these amazing places. Um, and then when you come and you talk to people that sort of live in one city and never leave that, you feel bad for those people.

Speaker 1:          02:25:14       Everyone's got their own, their own path. You know, everyone's thinking. You all zen. That's true. I, I don't, I mean I guess a little bit of pity, maybe a little bit of like, Oh, you don't have a passport that sound fortunate to live in this wildlife adventure. I mean, it's an insane path and I think there's something cool about talking to people that travel all over the world. It's like they have a perspective. It's almost like they're like, oh, okay. Like you go to a bunch of different places, you see a bunch of different ways that people live and you go, oh, all right, there's not really one way to do this. There's no better way or bad way. There's just different ways to do so, which is, that's what you see everywhere. Um, yeah, you know, I've got some friends who left high school and they married the local mechanic and don't even have a passport to dude who's married and mechanic what I'm talking about.

Speaker 1:          02:26:04       Female girls, but whatever. Same difference, but basically never left the town that they grew up in. You know, and that's it. That's what they do. Maybe that town as mushrooms and the trip in a different way. There's a lot of cow Patty Duke who do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do. But I think about that when I, when I think of traveling to different cultures and experiencing these really incredibly varied ways of living that people have. I always think new look at all the different varieties of, of life. Like I posted this instagram video last night of this jellyfish that I saw in an aquarium and I remember thinking when I was looking at that jellyfish, like what if that thing was on another planet? We would think it would be the most fascinating discovery that man is. Don't even get me started. There's jellyfish that are immortal, immortal, like literally they live for live forever.

Speaker 1:          02:26:55       Look at that thing. I think. Yeah, that was a great little video cephalopods. I think if you're talking about aliens, underwater cephalopods is where it's at. And cephalopods the Nautilus Nautilus, Shell Octopus, squid and cuttlefish and cuddle fish on my favorite creature. Actually, Jamie, there's a video on my youtube channel called Adam verse cuttle fish. You'll, you'll dig it. Um, me just free diamond with the cuttlefish, but they're the most amazing, amazing, great trailer and the alien in so many respects. And a lot of the research on them is only like five years older. So we're still working stuff out because they're the fastest color and texture chamber in the world. They like a neon sign, pulsating color shoe. I think it's about 390 DPI is the resolution they can predict on this scheme. It's just phenomenal. They have three hearts. They don't have hemoglobin that I've read blood.

Speaker 1:          02:27:46       They've green blood. It's kind of a copper based blood. I'm a little bit less inefficient. Hence they have three hearts. Um, they have like a jet engine, they pump water and around their head and push it out a little nozzle at the front. Um, look at that thing. It's like an octopus with tiny legs in the cephalopod family as well. So this one's got a cuttlefish bone, so it's neutrally buoyant. It's kind of just floating off the surface, but it looks like whatever's behind it. It's very, very good at camouflage and also communicates via color as well. But what we couldn't work out for many years, once you put them in a dark box and they will still mimic. So you put in a box with no light whatsoever. They

Speaker 2:          02:28:22       will still mimic whatever is behind them even though there's no light there to actually use. And then they would also mimic color and get their eyes. What do you mean they will mimic what's behind them? I mean there are many youth, a wall put a cuttlefish in a box pitch black and you put a triangle, a triangle shape behind them. They will mimic on the other side of triangle shape in their skin. And we still, we're still trying to work out how they do this because there's no light. And we knew that they did it with a color that their eyes don't see color. I see black and white, heavy amount of contrast. We actually only two years ago, they worked out in their skin. They see color via their skin or their eyes. I can go on. It's crazy. There's sexual reproduction is mom is really cool. They don't. They have a lack of our offices that don't have too many artifices to use. So we asked and are. So what they do is the male cuttlefish gets an arm and sticks it up his nostril, we'll call it a nostril. It's an artifice, whatever, and pulls out a sack of sperm and then goes up to the female and then sticks that arm with the sacral sperm. Lauren up her nostril, left nostril. And that's how they reproduce what? Yeah, it's sack fisting. Take a sack of sperm and they fixed it up

Speaker 3:          02:29:34       your nose and nostrils. The same orifice they use for smelling.

Speaker 2:          02:29:39       Um, we call it industrial, but it's just a whole. It's just a whole. But it's the closest one to their sexual watch it here. Oh God, I'm not prepared for this. January cuddles grabbing her. And he died straight after that. Actually. Yeah. They only live for about 18 months. So the Australian giant cuttle fish, different cuttlefish, different things, but 18 months. So they do that. They reproduced, they die.

Speaker 3:          02:30:06       My Friend, Remy Warren has this show called Apex Predator where he, um, he travels to all these different environments and tries to figure out how these various apex predators hunt their food and how they do it. And he said without a doubt that the most fascinating one that he did he studied was the octopus and it's like they are some kind of an alien creature. And when I didn't know until he came on the show, like how quickly they can change into the background that was like completely camouflaged, not just in color but also in texture. They mimic the texture behind them.

Speaker 2:          02:30:43       It's, I mean, it's hard to find them when you're scuba diving. It's actually hard to find them because they look exactly like what a them. Um, they have so many, like the more research you do on, they're just amazing. They have the intelligence of a six year old child. Um, and so they've been actually class recently as like, I forget the word, like sentience beans or something like that. So they're in the same class as dogs and monkeys and dolphins not do tests on them that harmed them. Basically. Biggest still going for Sushi. Oh yeah, you can kill them. You just can't. You can still get grilled octopus. It's like grilled six year old. I mean you probably,

Speaker 1:          02:31:20       it's a strange thing that we do and we decide what we will eat, what will we. And it varies hugely uncultured well that we don't eat dog here, but mean I made a mistake of watching a piece. I think it was a vice piece on that Yulin dog festival and I was like, whoa man, good Lord it. But again, it's entirely cultural because if you were an Indian person who is a Hindu and you see what we do to cows, that would be equally, if not more deserving because their cows are wholly what I love. I haven't done much India, but I've done the poll is that, no, we don't eat this cow, this cow sacred, but this buffalo, it's tasty. You just like what the together with the bird egg people and try to figure this out. It's just when you see certain traditions that exist in these cultures and try to decipher like how, how they got started, there's always a reason for it.

Speaker 1:          02:32:17       You can't go back. You can always just send a recent of why this started. This was, you know, don't eat pork here will you get Salmonella and it kills you. You know, of course. Always a risk that's for kosher food and things along those inspirational people have this hugely complex system of who you are allowed to talk to, who you're allowed to marry. This things called skins and takes a long time to come and get your head around. But when you look at the science behind it, it's the most efficient way ever conceived by humanity to ancient cultures to prevent inbreeding. So you're not allowed to talk to your sister. Can't talk to her and Kinda talk to because he might have sex with him so I won't have sex. My sister. We would trust. That's gross, but they can't talk to their sister. Yeah. And generally their mother as well. Well that makes you want to fuck your sister more. It's like damn. It must be good. I'm trying to keep me away from her. Yeah, you're a little twisted. I'm not saying me, man.

Speaker 1:          02:33:15       I'm just, you know, hypothetically this person that lived a long, long time ago when they came up these weird rules. Um, is it possible for a restroom? Just be two seconds and then we're gonna come back. Maybe some climate change will. Sure, yeah, absolutely. Short reproduction. What do you like your watch, man? That was a cool watch that um, it's, it's actually quite cheap. That's cool. Look. And it doesn't have to be expensive copays. You like to have a look? No, I'm good. Don't worry about it. Alright, we'll be back again. I when the bladder war, I like to find someone who could sit here and drink coffee and whiskey as long as we can. Oh, what the fuck's wrong? Do you think my bladder has changed? It must've changed a. This is not stuff that I was born with. I think it's just from doing three hour podcasts like like right now if I had to pee it will be a struggle.

Speaker 1:          02:34:00       I've been sitting here drinking coffee. I had a glass of whiskey with him, Jack and coke diet coke of course. Because of my diet. Like a truck driver? Yeah, developed it. I wonder. I'd like to have a competition with truck drivers so who could hold their pis longer? They could pull over though. Truck driver could pull over like two hours in. Just pull over man. I've left podcast before. I have. I've timed it poorly. You know what it is if I don't pee right before the show it could get because then I might've gotten it hours without peeing. It's weird. It doesn't break the seal. You know like when you eat, when you're drinking first, then you gotta go every 20, 30 minutes. Sometimes it happens to me. Hmm. It got the UFC event one time. I shouldn't have gone at all. I have just held it will, you know, where it breaks me, monster energy drinks.

Speaker 1:          02:34:48       I don't drink those fuckers anymore, but at the UFC they have those and sometimes you know, you're doing six hours of commentary, you want a little caffeine, but uh, I would have those monsters and man that I would have to piss like within an hour. It's crazy. Like there's some stuff in them, like there are some form of a diuretic in some way. Maybe you would know this. I looked up something yesterday when I was eating a burrito on a hot sauce. There's something called Xantham gum and yeah, and it was like a thickening agent is what I read. But when I was looking on the wikipedia about Xantham Gum, it says it's a, it's used as a heavy, a laxative. Really. Then in my head I was just like, maybe that's what's making people shit themselves with a lot of hot sauces that not the hot sauce could be.

Speaker 1:          02:35:33       Could be. I think there's a reaction that your body has. Your stomach has to hot sauce to your body. Like what in the fuck? And that makes you shit yourself to not really necessarily shit yourself as much as have to take a shit. How the hell did you get their bladder control? Drinking hot sauce. Xantham gum out of the room for 30 seconds. Wow. I've actually, while I was kind of the toilet, I just remembered pirates. Yes. Do you know why they have the earrings? The Golden. Because they're gay. They're all gay. Well actually you offered it right? But they did say we're going to. Sexuality is a big part of it. Well that was why they would do it. I mean they were. They would discuss why they dress so flamboyantly. Yes. But that's not why they were gold earrings. No, it was actually payment. Full burial.

Speaker 1:          02:36:20       So when you got washed over overboard, you end up floating up on a beach somewhere. We'd go bury you in. Then take the gold, the golden. That's a good deal. Yeah. That's interesting. I thought it was just to look cool. Look like a bad ass with scarf was women. It was the oldest game. It was. There was women pirates. But to be a woman pirate though, you had to be able to be able to get away with. You had to look like a male basically. You had to be able to get away with giving away. Yeah, it'd be like a softball player and type chick really likes crossfit thick neck ones. Still Very womanly, but large style after traveling the world for, for while the last few years, I'm really big fan of yoga pants on airplanes. Oh yes. Yep. They figured it out. They figured it out.

Speaker 1:          02:37:11       It's amazing that it took so long, but now girls would just rocking them. I'm like, bitch, you ain't going to yoga. You just want everybody to senior perfect ass. How dare you walk around. But men can't do that. If you walk around with Yoga Pants and your shaft is just bulging the front of your pants, people would think you're rude, like it's quite fine and dandy. It's sexist. They're asked to be plump and right there and all juicy and inviting. But you can have your, uh, your man bits compressed and front and center, there'll be rude, right? At least on a plane full of people, which is not acceptable. A man can't walk around with Yoga Pants on. Very few do, right? Yeah. I don't think I could. I didn't think I could pull it off. It's an argument for a large fanny pack yoga pants and a large fanny pack for a man.

Speaker 1:          02:37:56       It's like, what is behind that thing? Wouldn't you like to know? My eyes are up here fucker. Oh, fanny pack. That just cracks me up when you say that, but because you guys. The Vagina is a vagina in England and Australia as well. But also we wouldn't be caught dead wearing an actual fanny pack bumbag would it be? And then just not fashionable. Um, I wear one. You wait one all the time. I could see it's being useful. It's amazing. Yeah. If you're not trying to get laid when just rocket. Do you want one? I have them. I'm trying to get laid. So should we talk about climate change? Is that something that you want to bring up? I'm just amazed at how many tangents you've been able to go on in the last few hours. It's impressive where you're in this with me. Yeah, I know. It's both our faults.

Speaker 1:          02:38:44       Okay. Um, so I don't know how much to talk about here. Like you've got such an intelligent audience either. I don't listen, don't, don't get too crazy little monkeys out there listening to. So I guess first thing is don't shoot the Messenger. Normally when someone starts talking about climate change, they look for reasons to shoot them. Basically you need to, you know, it's got such a political aspect to it and let you got to disassociate that and just look at the science, you know, and also take the whole. I hate the word belief. I believe in climate change. Well two plus two equals four. If you believe it's fine. It doesn't really change the fact, you know, anyway, it's got a whole lecture on this. So I do, do you do ted talks on this? Uh, I had, uh, to, to Chada on board the ship.

Speaker 1:          02:39:28       We had a mission Bluetooth, which was all trying to ocean conservation, Sylvia Earle, heads of Ted talk. Fascinating. Fascinating. Um, but, uh, yeah, I just listened to them basically. But um, so then you have climate, which is what a big mistake people make is they go, oh, it's weather, it's cold outside. Well, that's climate. Climate is weather over very large timescales and that's a big one that people get wrong straight away. Um, but when you look at, say 14,000 peer reviewed articles about climate change, there's only 24 that reject global warming. So to have this whole thing, there's a debate going on. There is no debate. There's a debate. Twenty four people debate. No, I know what you're saying. I'm just joking. You've seen the documentary, I assume merchants of doubt. Um, I think that one might have ms.me actually. It's pretty fascinating. I had Michael Shermer in here who's the head of skeptic magazine magazine.

Speaker 1:          02:40:21       Michael Shermer is a pretty famous skeptic and he was with the skip toy one. You ripped him a new one. That was guys. He did it himself a full. Um, but schermer is much more reasonable and intelligent man. But he was, I'm talking about this documentary. We actually brought it up. I forgot that he was in it. It was a documentary where it showed that the same people that were spreading misinformation that were actually paid to spread misinformation about cigarettes, about cigarettes being addictive were the very same people that were spreading misinformation about climate change. People will sell outfit. Yeah, exactly. And they're just good at it. They're good at bullshit. Those 20 full people. Yeah. You look into it. They're all paid by the state, by the oil petroleum. It's a little bit. Yeah. So I mean you and me, we now and the whole world kind of come around to, in the last two years, the world is warming.

Speaker 1:          02:41:11       We know this well, no matter which way you look at what's happening, something's going on and people normally go, oh well that's, you know, solar and stuff like that going on. But if you remove the solo, you know from the equation, it's still going up. It's still going up because we understand the soul cycle's quite well, we've done a lot of research on them so we know what's going on. And then the other thing that people always say, oh, it's happened over and over again throughout history, you know, and so this one's 800,000 years and yeah, you see it psychically going up and down. But I always like to look at the averages and the average is, is kind of CEO to with an average and maybe to 25 parts per million. You know what we're up to now, what were like 403 at the moment.

Speaker 1:          02:41:54       Okay. So the average been to 50, never got higher than 300 and we now are at 400 or something. So we're off the charts when it comes to that and temperature the same. It's always been a little colder than it actually is today. And that's just because you know, earth rotating around the sun. A little bit of progression here, a little bit of a tilt here. We understand this quite well, otherwise we won't be able to make observations of the skies as closely as we do. So people always go, yes it's solar, but if you look at solar since 1960, 70, it's been going down. But the amount of solar radiation, the amount of energy that Sun's putting out that hits planet earth has been going down and yet temperature has been going up big time. So right there you kind of can get away from the whole.

Speaker 1:          02:42:36       It's just natural cycles. Something's really going on that's not meant to be there. And so as of last year, we crossed 400 parts per million co two in the atmosphere and actually between look at that spike. That's crazy. From the 19 tens to 2015, this is from 400,000 years ago. No, but I mean the last spike. Oh yeah. Which shows 19. Ten to 2015. That's when it goes completely vertical. Yeah. Straight up, straight up. And so, I mean even in the last 12 months we've had the sharpest. Rosin Sio two as well, have about just under three parts per million. So it's still increasing. It's not slowing

Speaker 2:          02:43:12       down at all. It's actually increasing big time.

Speaker 3:          02:43:14       Spike is crazy. It's weird to look at. Yeah, it's like a rocket ship taking off straight up in the air. Anytime you see this, you know any scientist sees this, Ooh, that's not, that's not normal. That's not what things. A cyclic. They don't just go the hockey, whatever. You got hockey stick. Do you remember when an inconvenient truth came out and so many people were attacking Al Gore immediately afterwards, boy, those conservatives, they fucking piled on. It's almost like they were just trying to avoid the information, getting out, just trying to keep business as usual for as long as possible. I haven't wondered what's the world we currently live in. If our goal became president. Oh, he should've fucked over that. That was one of the weirdest elections that were like, yeah, yeah, yeah. We know you won, but whatever. George Bush's second term come out, we never get rid of a president in wool.

Speaker 3:          02:44:05       Do you always have. They always get to terms with is John Curry was the second term, right? It was Al Gore was the first one, right? Wasn't it a algorithm? An algorithm running against him the first time and then John Kerry did the second time. Was that what it was? And even John Kerry, there was some fuckery, there was some fuckery when it came to, there was, did you ever. Well, it's totally different subject, but there was a fantastic hbo documentary on called Hacking Democracy and it was all about how these diebold machines that were created these election counting machines, we're, they were huge contributors to the Republican Party, the diebold corporation, which changed her name afterwards, but they also, they engineered some sort of a back door into the system, like clearly there could be hacked and they showed it like without doubt on the show, on the, in the documentary that you can hack these machines and alter the results. And these are the machines that they used. One Swish became president of receipts, something. Then remember the Dang d dangling Chads, whoever it was.

Speaker 2:          02:45:13       It's messed up. It's missed. Oh yeah, yeah. Let's, um, so I mean, temperatures are rising. We notice, as I said, worldwide, I think we're about one point five at the moment, degrees above preindustrial northern hemisphere to at the moment. So where are they going? Well, that going towards about six degrees by the end of the century. Six. Yeah, so you'll talk to people and they'll get four point five, um, any climate scientist, you get this all the time, so you to tell me what's going to happen by the end of the century and they got a four point five degrees Celsius temperature rise and then you have a drink with them afterwards and they're like, well I can prove four point five to 99 point nine, nine percent probability, but I can prove six at 92 percent probability, you know what I mean? And so they don't ever print it because they can't be 100 percent certain. This is a few more variables. They need more data that need more research. They need more calculate. That's the real number. That's actually where it's heading. So that's why you get these great graphs. You see this

Speaker 1:          02:46:10       graph here, it's a few years old. It says, oh, it may only get to one point five degrees. We were already there. So the lowest end of this is already happened. The higher end is, is is about six degrees depending on the different research that you do, but I think it's just good that people realize that scientist won't publish something unless they're 100 percent certain on something and so there's a lot of things that they're pretty certain on. They'll tell you over a drink later on, but they weren't published it and that generally. That's why every year it seems to get worse and worse than predictions. I'm positive proof of global warming is visual visual joke than anything [inaudible] I don't think. I think that people found out. People look better. Those little tiny underwear. This is, by the way, the vast majority of the people that enjoy this show.

Speaker 1:          02:46:59       Listen, I'm trying to talk about it more than 90 percent so that that picture, they're like, what the fuck did they see? There's just an old school bloomers from the 19 hundreds, early 19 hundreds to the little tiny bikini underwear that the young ladies like to wear today, which I support. That's a global warming is bringing us. He Ha fucking fire up. The higher up the carbon out. Skip through this as quickly as I can. What's going on? Why is this all happening while we're pumping out non billion tons of carbon dioxide per year. And the vast, what I like about this graph is that you can see that about three and a half billion tons is actually coming from coal and about three and a half from petroleum. So it actually just removing coal from the equation is like a third more than. That's China is a big one, right?

Speaker 1:          02:47:47       He's straight. He's got heaps of coal fire power plants. Australia will America has some as well, right? But China is a, they have a huge problem with it, right? You need an ancient technology, uh, hundreds of years old. We got much better stuff these days. Okay. Instead of just going over these graphs and showing how we're fucked, what can be done? Is there something that can be done? Do you, do you have a solution yet? Adam crop for president of the world. I couldn't put up with politicians. No. You could put. Um, I, yeah, I have, I can just skip straightforward to the solutions if you like, but we have to ride horses or no, no, no, I just, you know, just want to point out that, you know, different things are going on. Cyclones or hurricanes are getting worse and worse. The more powerful. There's more of them. Jetstreams messed up. Um, sea level rise. Oh, you know, they say maybe two meters, but once you factor in positive feedback loops and stuff like that, it can be, can be significantly higher. So you come back to the old mold Steve's thing, you know, they're, they're gone. I'm interesting men. Do you ever heard of this guy? No. He was the president of the Maldives. He was the first democratically elected president of 100 percent Muslim country to be like carrots, like a rabbit out of his teeth.

Speaker 1:          02:49:02       He was a marine biologist, but he's looking at. He's biting his lower lip, like he's a. is that just a weird face? They caught him, but he spent, he spent six years in jail and 18 months in solitary confinement. Whoa. For what? For going for talking about climate change. Yes. It's crazy. He wanted to beat him in jail. He's. He's currently in jail I think at the moment for talking about climate change. Yeah. Wow. Who put them in jail? The next president that came in. Anyway, but so what you have is this huge potential sea level when we go, oh, to me does it. Most people go, oh yeah. To me to build a wall. Whatever people in Shanghai would disagree. But anyway, you have the sea level rise potential with positive feedback loops. So water vapor is probably the most well understood. You know, more, more hotter.

Speaker 1:          02:49:49       You have the more water vapor you have and that cycles back on itself and it gets harder. Another one is like the permafrost in Siberia and stuff like this. So as this area thor's it really solid and methane. Then cycles and it gets more and more and more. So if you take this all into account, then you get a huge sea level rise of about 60 meters is the potential of what can go on 16 meters. No, no, six zero, 60, 60. Convert that defeat at your leisure about 200 feet, oh my God, but show a graph. One thing, show an image of Australia with 60 meter sea level rise, whereas the states there, Florida where it's good, but get rid of Florida. California, let's say, has plenty of water. Now, problem solved. You've got a nice little stuff in the middle. We a plan in place to live.

Speaker 1:          02:50:37       You know stuff in the middle. There's no one there anyway, right now, most of years gone. Good, good riddance. Then you also have the ocean acidification. Do you know much about that one? Yes, I have read about that. That's one of the more disturbing aspects of the. Not just ocean acidification, but less oxygen and more dead zones. All the last time this happened, which is it's happening and it's only a couple of decades away. Ninety six percent, 96 percent of the marine species on this earth perished. When was this? A 252 million years ago while we bounce back. We did. It's called the great dying at the current trends and what's going on. Two thousand and 50. We're looking at this ocean acidification event happening, so that means that old coral reefs won't be able to grow carl anymore. Uh, no shellfish can grow shells anymore. I'm basically the combined calcium carbonate out of the water anymore.

Speaker 1:          02:51:34       They're basically then the chemistry doesn't work anymore and that at the moment is looking at 2050 Jesus. And that's pretty much, that's all your fish species. Everything that's, that's a lot of stuff going. I saw something online about, there was a solution that they were proposing where they would put scrap iron all throughout the ocean and then that would somehow or another attract algae and that would uh, basically seeding a whole heap of life to balloon phyto plankton. And then the base is the start of the food chain. You're going, hey, here's a whole heap of stuff for you that makes you grow faster and bigger and stronger. And so it seeds that. And so yeah, it will absorb a large amount of co two for sure. Not Enough. It's, it's tough. The, the ocean is doing a damn good job at the moment of absorbing a lot of CEO two.

Speaker 1:          02:52:28       And that's why we have this kind of 40 year lag thing going on because the ocean absorbs a lot of heat and it's a heat sink, you know, but I mean, this one here, this is from, this is this month, and you've got 12 degrees warmer in the top. It's crazy. And Yeah, about 12 degrees warmer than standard than normal arctic. The Arctic basically didn't have a winter this year. It's just stayed. Some stayed summer or kind of warm. Twelve degrees Celsius warmer than usual. Whoa. Yeah. So that whole optic ice free sort of thing that's not too far away. It's actually not too far away. It's closer than you think in Greenland is thawing very, very fast. I mean if you look at the melts, uh, over 50 percent of greenland melted last year. Most of it refroze thank God, but it, it's melting over 50 percent. Yeah. As a graph in front of your 2015 mil percentage was over 50 percent of it melted.

Speaker 1:          02:53:21       I'm normally just over about 20 percent melts per year, but a large portion of melted was greenland at one point in time. Green is that with the reason why they called the Greenland? Just messed up the naming because Iceland, I know Iceland and Greenland should be the other way around, but aura. But I'm going there for the first time. Actually in June. Go on a national geographic explorer. I'm doing svalbard, Iceland, Greenland. Super excited. So again, I love these charts and graphs, but we're almost out of time here. Where we're at. Three minutes. What can we do? Well, yeah. What can we do? Um, you need to save the children. But I prefer save the animals. So that's what you like. The animals one, the people. What? I'm scared of. Toddlers, they kill more people than terrorists. I'm scared of them. Toddlers do. Toddlers in the states kill more people in terrorists. Um, how do they kill people? Shoot them. Generally know those guns are killing people, not toddlers. Right?

Speaker 1:          02:54:19       Well, just keep the fucking guns away from the tolerance and don't kill anybody. How many people get killed by toddlers? It's a lot. It's crazy. Really? Toddlers with guns. Website. I should be a new band. Jamey. Thinking about a band name. Toddlers with guns. Toddler. Yes, death by toddler, there is a million different things you can do with climate change. There is the thing that most people do is, oh, here's a great idea. We need to do that one idea. No, we need to do all of them. We need to do them all now and we need to do them all 20 years ago basically. That's why I keep saying really have you tried turning it on and off again? Like we kind of do need to kind of do a full reset, but we need to start. We have the technology to get to do all these things and keep living standards out. We have the technology, we just need to start acting on it. Whether

Speaker 2:          02:55:04       it be hyperloop, hyperloop is a great idea. Why aren't we doing that? Um, and the big thing that always comes to me, you know, put solar panels on your roof. Efficiency is a huge one. Change to led, led bulbs, all that sort of stuff. There's a million different things and we've gone over this a million times as well, but always comes down to money. And I always say there's lots of money out there to be done. There's lots of money to be used and where you can raise taxes, carbon taxes, a great way, very efficient, been proven over and over. It's a great way to actually curb climate change. You could just print the money like the bankster that always works. You could, I'm going to get in a lot of trouble for this, but you could take a little bit of the war budget, that military budget and how you're going to get in trouble for that.

Speaker 2:          02:55:45       That's really amazed. I do climate change talks among moment. I talk about reducing military budgets and putting it towards good climate change. That sort of freedom. My posing. I love team American. That's a great man. Um, so I mean I actually did, I started a nonprofit, but it's more of an idea at the moment called world without war. And that was all about hey, let's take 50 percent of the military budgets and put it towards large infrastructure projects are planting trees, build a hyperloop. And once you do the figures, like once you have, oh, I've got $2,000,000,000,000, what can I do for $2,000,000,000,000? You'd be amazed. You can give free education for everyone. You can convert all those coal fire power plants into renewables. You can completely reduce deforestation, you can do zero website world without or.org. I said it's just an idea. Just started. Um, but that's the last one I'd like to end on because I know we're running out of time is buckminster fuller and I think he put it best, which is it is now highly, highly feasible to take care of everyone on earth at a higher standard of living than any have ever known. It no longer has to be you and me. Selfishness is unnecessary. War is obsolete. It's a matter of converting the high technology from weaponry to luminary.

Speaker 1:          02:56:56       That's a beautiful quote. But how do you, how do you deal with Isis? How do you deal with Isis? Once again, I'll get in trouble. Don't, ah, don't build isis in the first place. Don't give them over weapons. But once you, uh, once you do have them with all the weapons, what is this? People getting shot by toddlers on a weekly basis this year. It's real. Oh my fucking God. More Americans who are two year olds are shooting people. Yeah. What the fuck? Or in October, 2015, it said 43 instances. What? Yeah. Oh my God. This is insane. In 2015, at least 13 toddlers have been, have inadvertently killed themselves with firearms. 18 more injured themselves. 10 injured other people and two killed other people. So I'm still at children. Well, we're just, it's not the kids. It's people that leave the fucking guns around kids. That's what it says. You didn't Australia, we have no guns. Yeah, we had the largest massacre on earth. I'm 36 people or something got killed and we just tend to run. Went, eh. You know what

Speaker 3:          02:58:02       we don't against worked rather well we did for you guys. But again, you have the population of Los Angeles and in China and Hong Kong land. Yeah. There's, there's something like a certain. I think there's hundreds of millions of guns in America. I think there's as many guns as there are people and there are trillions of rounds of ammunition and the gun people say if there was really a gun problem, you know, it would all our guns and all our ammo through is really a gun problem. I fucking just reasonably suggested, reasonably suggested that people that are mentally unbalanced maybe shouldn't have guns and people and the fucking hate from the far right, but like the people that really believe in the second amendment says though, right, it's a right to keep and bear not but no buts. I believe in the second amendment, but no, no, no, no buts, no buts. Guns. Isn't it like a well armed militias and stop government? Yeah, that's what's supposed to be. Well, that's what they think. Like those, the Oregon people who we never figured out who first dubbed them. Y'All kinda whoever that guy is, Kudos to you or her ma'am or sir, it's great. Great Name. But uh, yeah, those people, there's a lot of people like that that think will, they're coming for our guns.

Speaker 3:          02:59:30       It's education.

Speaker 2:          02:59:32       When it comes down to it, the best thing, money for dollar for dollar that you can do is education. If you educate women in the world that have less children and that that solves a lot of problems right there to the truth. I'm the only other thing. Dollar for dollar education is the best way and especially educating women and in third world countries especially, but that was the way 20 years ago I feel now we've gotten to the point where we really. I said 40 year lag, so what's happening now? We're not going to see for 40 years. We need to do something major. We need to do something right now and that's why I quite like the world without war thing because for every dollar you spend lobbying to get people to reduce their military budget, you multiply, you're going to get a lot more money diverted to something that

Speaker 3:          03:00:14       is better for society basically.

Speaker 2:          03:00:18       I mean that's whether it's infrastructure or hyperloop or plant trees or get electric cars, whatever, throw the money at it.

Speaker 3:          03:00:24       Well, very few people would argue with you that the world would be better off without war. I think the real argument, everyone argues with me on that one, I think the real argument would be whether or not the rest of the world would cooperate. Like we all would agree. Let's just like ramp down our gun production or missile production. Let's ramp it down and everybody relaxed and let's reallocate those resources. Most people would say that'd be a great idea, but who's going to do it as well? You know? Is Isis going to do it? I like these example

Speaker 2:          03:00:53       of Indian Pakistan, India and Pakistan keep raising the military budgets every year to compete with each other because they want to make sure that we're spending

Speaker 1:          03:01:00       the same amount as the other guy because this guy, the other guy, you go to these two countries and you go, Hey, here's a treaty. Just like all the trade agreements, whatever that you sign and you reduce the military budget by 50 percent and the other guy promises to do it as well. Suddenly you're reducing war which are more for. And you're also helping a relieving a heap of money available for Climate Change Abatement. So I think it's a win win situation, but all my Lord I get in trouble. We're not talking about. Well you signed your hippie. Got Idealistic Hippie. That's what the problem is. The people right now are, yeah, fuck this hippie shutting their iphone off right now. Fucking hippie. I hate when Rogan as hippies on. But who wants war man? Nobody wants war. So maybe Jocko. Jocko. My aunt is it. Most people don't want it, you know, they date, you know, they reluctantly accept the fact that we have disputes and then we have a armies to handle that and keep us safe.

Speaker 1:          03:01:54       But if you ask them, would it be better if we just took that money? And instead of like having all this military spending on climate change. Yeah. But then there's also those people that are in the military that don't have jobs anymore. Like you know how many soldiers, like we have less soldiers. I'm sure we can get jobs for them that don't involve killing people with as many different ways to do this. You can. This is all very reasonable. I just don't know. Yeah, no. I said, I'm amazed at how much kickback I get from that one thing, but I normally don't mention it. I don't mean to make climate change. I don't want to convolute it with something like that. It's such a perfect idea. A perfect idea is in that console a lot of problems and at the timeframe that we need to solve them because everything else, if you look at the climate, Paris talks, right?

Speaker 1:          03:02:37       Cop Twenty one, so the first time they got together talking about climate science, they eventually went, okay, 195 countries. We agree something's gone wrong and we need to prevent the earth and warming to two degrees Celsius. Well, six months later we're already there, you know, so and, and they, they're not agreeing to do anything for five years as well, so they don't even start to do anything five years. Like if we wait for politicians to do something about this, we're so screwed. We really are. Well, that's one of the problems with having politicians is that they're not experts. They're not experts in anything. They're experts in figuring out how to get people to vote for him. That's it. Most politicians, they're not the best at anything. They're certainly not like exemplary human beings who are beyond reproach. The good egg, you know, they're good at debate, so like other than Bernie Sanders, I mean Bernie Sanders seems to be a pretty exemplary guy. Believe or not believe in socialism. Argue it as you may. He seems like a great guy with some pretty good ideas about the world, but we're at a time, one at a time. Adam. Got to see how quickly that guys is. Three hours and 15 minutes, man. Right about that. Something like that were over. We went over. We don't give a fuck over here. Thank you very much. So let's do this again man. How often are you in la? I have no idea, but hey, I'll come back next year. You're all over the place, man.

Speaker 3:          03:03:58       Come, come around and come visit us, but thank you very much. Really appreciate it. It's been a great pleasure and hey, keep up the good work chart. You are really doing some amazing stuff here. I don't think people tell you that enough that we're listing all the way back in Australia and we're loving what you're doing. Thank you brother. I really appreciate that. All right. Thank you friends. That's it for this week. You fuckers. I'll see you soon. Bye. Bye. Big Kiss.
