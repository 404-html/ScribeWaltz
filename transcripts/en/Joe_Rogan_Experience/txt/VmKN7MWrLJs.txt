Speaker 1:          00:00          Hello Rick, we'll talk to you when you're surviving animal food in plastic and then eat it and then poop it out and eat it later. Like I'm take the plastic off and eat it. Jesus Christ. It seems like it could work. That's a technique I've never thought. I mean if you're going to be like on your own for five days, you can eat a bunch of food but wrap it up in plastic and then later poop it out. Then untaken out with. Then how would you get the nutrients from the food in the first place with your stomach and a piece of plywood is this poop it out. I don't understand it. And then you poop it out and like before you leave for your trip, go to and go get stuffed like Boston market or something. Conversation. Don't ruin this when you're poorly thought out ideas and they get a bunch of plastic.

Speaker 1:          00:41          Don't tell him stop. Can't, can't tell you how to eat his poop. No, no, no. I'm saying like eat like on big meal before you were about to leave. He would eat his own food. It's called the things called second harvest and then native American maybe take a bunch of like protein bars, wrapped them up in plastic, eat it, and then poop it out in a couple of days. Then unwrap the plastic they need what kind of shit you really think a fucking whole protein bar in plastic can make it through your digestive tract and carry the bars in my backpack and just eat them three days later, poorest understanding of the human digestive tract ever exhibited on a podcast. I was trying to figure out what you were saying. I thought you were saying eating poop. You're not talking about a little Baggie of heroin that a drug. I was thinking like, we're going to make you survive. You'll. You'll get another hour's worth of energy from that little heroin bag. What about Petite Finlaison?

Speaker 1:          01:34          Eight ounces wrapped in plastic. You're going to die. People get diverticulitis because they get a fucking watermelon seed. Freaking word diverticulitis, she says signifies word. Well, Brock Lesnar for the UFC got diverted because I had a serious operation when they removed 12 inches of his colon. Found out about it. I looked into it and I thought it was just because of eating meat, but Anthony Bourdain and informed me that you can eat a seed, like you get like a sunflower seeds or something stuck inside your tract, your digestive tract, and it starts an abscess and you get sick. Yeah, you could. You can die from a fucking seed getting stuck. He's like all kinds of stuff gets stuck in there, so it's not necessarily just protein. There's also contributed to the game is like a Gi track. Dr. Now you can't eat a petite filet minion should it out in the woods. That's all I'm saying. You gotta have to have a better strategy than ever. I guess I was thinking survivor island, like trying to find a way to cheat. You can't. You can't carry it in your backpack. You'll know you're pregnant if you had enough food for a day, all the food backed up with your body. What can a calorie consumption are you thinking you have to have.
