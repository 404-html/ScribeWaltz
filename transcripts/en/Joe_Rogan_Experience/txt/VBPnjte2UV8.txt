Speaker 1:          00:00:03       Boom, and we're live. Hello Sir. How are you? Nice to see you too. Thanks. What you do eating chocolate. When you got here and you told me that you are a Cacau Sharmane and I said those are strong words. They are. What does that mean? So I was in Berlin last year giving a talk at a tech conference and somebody invited me to a sacred cacao ceremony. Never heard of it. And I thought, wow, that sounds awesome. I love chocolate. I went, it was so wonderful. And at the end they were talking about these people, these great Cacau Schamens and I thought, what is that? I gotta be one of those. Since I came back, I looked for certification. There wasn't certification I self declared and then I started doing a cacao ceremonies in New York. Now I have hundreds of people who come. It's really wonderful and it's exciting.

Speaker 1:          00:00:45       Like if you want to be a doctor, you got to go to medical school, right? You want to be a comedian, you got to be become a professional. You gotta put on your time Cacau Sham and just show up. It's like putting up a shingle. Hey, I'm the COUSHATTA. And if anybody shows up and they have a good time, then your real, now how much do you need to know about Krakow? Like the nutritional properties of a cow is amazing. It's great stuff. It's incredible. And so definitely cacau and people have been using it ceremonially for about 5,000 years. Um, so it's incredible. Um, chocolate makes people happy. It helps your brain function, your circulation, and there's all these kinds of incredible things. But in the ceremonies that I do, I have to key messages. One is you are the drug. I mean, we all take people take drugs, people take Iowa.

Speaker 1:          00:01:28       Oscar and silicide been all these kinds of things. But I also think that we have for the things that we take drugs for this kind of release and happiness and joy, we have those things inside of us and we just kind of get out of our way. We can experience them in. The second thing is I believe that there are no, I say this in my ceremonies. There's no such thing as sacred Chiuchow or sacred plants are sacred. Mountains are sacred people. If we don't treat life with sacredness, but if we recognize that everything is sacred, then we infuse life with sacredness and meaning and that's, anyway, that's why I do, it's a lot of fun. That's very interesting from a guy who specializes essentially in manipulating life. Well, you know we have manipulated life as humans for a very short on time, but it's interesting the idea of things being sacred, but your specialty is manipulating genetics, right?

Speaker 1:          00:02:18       Yeah. Well, so that is this strange moment that we're in because for about for about 3.8 billion years, our species has evolved by this set of principles we call Darwinian evolution, random mutation and natural selection. And it's brought us here. We used to be single cell organisms and now look at us and there's been a lot of magic in that process and there still is, but we humans are deciphering some of that magic. We are like looking under the hood of what it means to be human and we are increasingly going to have the ability to manipulate all of life, including our own. Yeah. That is very unnerving to a lot of people. It's, it's uncomfortable and scary and yeah, it is. They like things the way they are. We, Amy, I'd like to stay the way I am. We always think that there's, we always think that there's a built in conservative conservatism in our brains and yet we live these lives that are entirely dependent on these radical changes that our ancestors have created.

Speaker 1:          00:03:18       I mean, we didn't find this building or agriculture medicine, uh, in nature. We built all those things and then everybody gets a new baseline when you're born and you think, well, you know, I'm, I want, you know, organic corn, I want whatever. But all these things are creation. We live in entirely created world and our ability to manipulate and change that world is always growing. And I think we need to recognize that, but there's being afraid is okay and being excited as okay and we need to find the right balance between those two emotions. I think for a lot of people, they feel like so many changes happen, particularly when you're talking about genetically modified foods. So many things happened before they realize they had happened. So when they're like, hey man, I don't want it any eat any GMO fruit. Right. Well then you probably shouldn't eat any fruit.

Speaker 1:          00:04:06       Yup. Because everything that you buy has been changed. Like every orange that you borrowed that, that's why I want an orange to be like, yeah, go buy an apple. Apple's didn't used to be like that. Tomatoes didn't used to be like that. No, I know. That's we, we reset our baseline just from when we were kids. So if you went back 12,000 years ago to the end of the last ice age and you said, all right, find me all these things that we buy at whole foods. Most of them didn't exist. We, we've created them. Sure. And then in the 1970s, we had the ability to do what's recombinant DNA, what people call genetic modification. And people are afraid because it's well that feels unnatural. We're applying science to food. Um, and you know, that's, that's the issue and now we're entering the era of genetically modified humans and there's that same level of uncomfortableness.

Speaker 1:          00:04:53       But what happened, the reason why I've written this, uh, this book hacking Darwin, is that if we approach genetically modified humans in the same way, the way we approached genetically modified foods, which is the scientists say, Hey, we've got this, we're going to manage them responsibly. And it just kind of happens to people. People are going to go nuts. I mean, you imagine how agitated people are about GMO foods. If they don't have a say in how the genetic, the experience, the human experience of genetic modification plays out, people are going to go berserk. So we have this window of time, we can start bringing everybody into an inclusive conversation about where we're going because where we are going is just radically different from where we've been. Yeah, I think it's an awareness issue. And I also think it's a perception issue. I think that everything people do is natural, including cities.

Speaker 1:          00:05:43       I think cities are natural. That's why they're all over the world. Yeah. I think there was naturals beehives and I think as much as we like to think that technology is not natural, it's clearly something people naturally make. Of course, they make it in every culture they can. It's the history of our species and we, we kind of misused this word natural. What is natural? I mean, maybe natural was when we used to live and we were just part of nature. And I always say it's like people say, Oh, I love nature. I love going out and hiking in the woods. The reason you love hiking in the woods is that we've murdered all the predators. It's like in the old days, in the year you stay in your cave, you're not going out and hiking in the woods. There's stuff that's going to kill you out there.

Speaker 1:          00:06:22       I know that was a massive luxury to go wander through the forest with no weapons. Yeah, nobody did know exactly, but he goes, oh, I want nature. I want my, you know, my natural corn, I want my, my natural Chihuahua. Even though, you know, 25,000 years ago there no Chihuahuas, a wolves, wolves. And look what we've done to them. I know will look what we have done to them. Made them pugs. Yeah. If you had natural wheat like, or natural corn in particular, natural corneas to be a tiny little thing. Yeah. It's just a few, a few weeds. Weird gross little grain. Yup. And then now we made it this big juicy, sweet, delicious thing that you put butter on, which is great, but we can't, we can't to have glyphosate, glyphosate, but we can't, we can't fetishize that. There's some kind of imaginary world where kind of everybody was wearing Birkenstocks and eating a whole foods that imaginary worlds sucked for us.

Speaker 1:          00:07:15       That's why we left it. It's true. But there's some sort of a balance, right? We know, we do appreciate the nature, uh, aspect of our world and eagles and salmon and all these wild things and to be able to see them as very cool. But yeah, you don't want to get eaten by those things. So you don't want them everywhere. You want to be able to go out and get your newspaper without being worried about getting attacked by a Jaguar. It helps you. Um, when you think about the future, uh, at least me, the one we talking about, my concern. Yeah. I'm worried that rich people are going to get ahold of this technology quick and they're going to have massive unfair advantages in terms of intellect, in terms of physical athletic ability. I mean, we, we really can have a grossly inbounds to world radically quickly if this happens fast when we don't understand exactly what the consequences of these actions aren't until it's too late.

Speaker 1:          00:08:10       And then we'd try to play catch up with rules and regulations and laws. Yeah, that's a very, very real danger. And that's why I've written this book. That's why I'm out speaking every day about this, this topic, because we need to recognize that if we have, if we approach these revolutionary technologies using the same values that we experience today, where you know, we're here and very comfortable, but just down the road there are people who are just, who are living without many opportunities. There are people in parts of the world like Central African Republic where there's just a warzone, kids are born malnourished. If those are our values today, we can expect that when these future technologies arrive, we'll use those, those same values. So it's real. And right now we have an opportunity to say, all right, these technologies are coming. Whatever we do, these technologies that are coming, there's a better possible future and a worst possible future and how can we infuse our best values into the process to optimize the good stuff and minimize the bad stuff.

Speaker 1:          00:09:08       And certainly what you're saying is a real risk thing of what happened when European countries had slightly better weapons and slightly better ships than everybody else. They took over the world, dominated everybody. And so yeah, that's, it's very real. That's the government's need to play a role in ensuring broad access in, in regulating these, uh, these technologies to make sure we don't get to that kind of dystopian scenario that you've laid down. Well, it's also in terms of governments regulating things, like why are they qualified? Who are they? Who are the government? So just people, right? It's the people that are either elected or the uh, you know, or, yeah, some sort of a monarchy or, and you're, you're dealing with either kings and queens and sheikhs or you're dealing with presidents. And we've seen in this country that sometimes our presidents don't know what the fuck they're talking about.

Speaker 1:          00:09:57       Right? So who are they to disrupt science to s to disrupt this natural flow of technology? Well, we need side. We need somebody to do it. We need some representation of our collective will be just to avoid some of the things like that. Just like you just mentioned, that that's the reason why humans banded together and made these kind of, the created governments. And the reason for democracy, especially if you have more functioning democracies, is that your government in some ways a reflects the will of the people in the government does things that individuals can't do. And I know there are a leather libertarian arguments. Well, everyone should just like if you want a little road in front of your house, either go build the road and pay some somebody. But there are a lot of things in even in that model that won't get done.

Speaker 1:          00:10:42       There are a lot of kind of big national, even global concerns that you need some kind of, uh, of regulation. Because what we're talking about is the future of life and life on earth. And there have to be some kind of guardrails. And that's why what I'm arguing for is we really need a bottom up. I think we every person, and that's why I'm so thrilled to be here with you today, Joe. Every person needs to really understand these revolutionary technologies like genetics, like AI and all of our responsibilities and opportunities to say, hey, this is really important. Here are the values that I think that, uh, that I cherish and just like you said, I don't want it to be that the wealthiest people are the ones who have kids with higher iqs and live longer and healthier than, than everybody else. And then so we have to raise our voice and our needs to be a bottom up process and a, and a top down process. And it's really, it's really hard that many people have a concern that someone else is going to do what we're not willing to do first. Yes, right. There were China and Russia, those, the big ones, China, especially China, they're very technologically advanced and their innovations off the chain when it comes to lick. Wowway just recently surpassed apple,

Speaker 2:          00:11:54       the number to a cell phone manufacturer in the world. Five years ago, they had some like a single digit share of the marketplace. Now they're number two on the planet earth. I mean, they, they hustle and if they just decided to make super people and they, they do it before we do. That's what people were worried about, right? There were who they're worried about. There's trivial things were seemingly trivial like athletics and then there's things that are really clear, like what, what's to stop people from just becoming the hulk? What's to stop people from becoming immortal? What's the style is

Speaker 3:          00:12:29       well live in the two questions. First is, is China, because I think it's a really big issue, the 21st, the story of the 21st century, one of the biggest stories of the 21st century will be how the US China rivalry plays out. And the playing field will be with these revolutionary technologies and China has a national plan to lead the world in these technologies. By 2050, they're putting huge resources. They have really smart people. They are really focused on it and it's a big deal in genetic technologies. Um, uh, when last year of the book hacking dorm was already in production in November when it was announced that these first genetically engineered babies had been born in China. And so I called the publisher and say, we need to pull this back out of production. So I need to reference this. But it didn't require much of a chain because I'd already written this is happening.

Speaker 3:          00:13:17       We're going to see the world's first gene edited humans. It's going to happen first in China. And here's why. So I just had a, had a, had to add a few sentences saying, and it just happened in October of, uh, of 2018. So China is on that path and we need to recognize that on one hand, the United States needs to be competitive. On the other hand, we don't want a runaway arms race of the human race, and that's why we need to find this balance between national ambition, uh, and some kind of of global rules. But it's really hard to do.

Speaker 2:          00:13:50       Yeah. And the other thing is that we're competing with them. Yeah. And so if they decide to do at first were almost compelled to do it second or compelled to try to keep up. Yeah. How far away do you think we are from physically manipulating living human beings versus fetuses versus

Speaker 3:          00:14:09       think in the physically manipulating living human beings? We are there, so, yeah. Yeah. So that that's, it may often, it's, it's called gene therapy. So for example, there's a whole class of, of treatments for, uh, for treating cancer called car t therapy. So you have a cancer when you're younger, your body is better able to fight cancers. Um, what you can do some of the cancer, you take their cells, you give there, you manipulate their cells to give them cancer fighting superpowers and you put them back into the person's body and now the person's body behaves like you're a younger person. You have the ability to fight back. So gene therapies are already happening. A relatively small number of them have already been approved, but there is a list of thousands of

Speaker 1:          00:14:52       them with regulators in applications to regulators around the world. So that the era of gin making genetic changes to living humans that's already here. Like what can they do with it? So far? So, so far most of it is focused on treating diseases. Um, but a lot more is a, is coming because when people think about the, the human, the genome, our genome isn't a disease genome. It's not a healthcare genome genome. It's a human genome. And so we are going to be able to do things that feel like crazy things like changing people's eye color, changing people's skin color to funky things. I mean there's a lot of of room, there weren't stuff that we're not doing now that we will be, uh, be able to do and anything we are from something like that, 10 years. So in 10 years we're going to have green people if in, if someone, so if someone's who chooses and if it's, we'll be able to go back to normal car.

Speaker 1:          00:15:42       Well if it's, that's a good question. Um, if it's with this kind of gene therapy and it's a small number of genes probably, but we are messing with very complex systems that we don't fully understand it. So that's why there's a lot of unknowns. And coming back to your point on regulation, that's why we, I don't think we want a total free for all. We're feels, hey, I'm going to edit my own jeans. You don't want some backyard hustler. Yeah, it's true lab. It's true. Cause they, you were saying about the hulk. I mean, I just think that there are all kinds of, you know, we're humans, we're diverse. Any kind of thing that you can think of. There is a range and there's, you know, crazy on the left and crazy on the ride and crazy at the top. And so people are going to want to do things.

Speaker 1:          00:16:22       And the question is, if for any society, what do we think is okay and what do we think is not okay? And maybe there should be some, I believe there should be some limit to how far people can go with experimenting, certainly, possibly likely on themselves, certainly on their future children. Certainly on the future children. Yeah. But once you're 18, I think, do whatever the fuck you want. If you really, well maybe 25, 25, we're going to have a lot of 25 year olds with Gills. It's like, it's like the tattoo seemed like a good idea. Yeah. Well we probably will. Um, so you think we're probably like 50 years away from that being a reality. So I think that we are, we, the genetic revolution has already begun and it's going to fundamentally change our lives in in three big areas. The first is our healthcare, so we're moving from a system of generalized healthcare based on population averages so that when you go to your doctor, you're treated because you're a human just based on average and we're moving to a world of personalized medicine and the foundation of your personalized health care will be your sequence genome in your electronic health records.

Speaker 1:          00:17:28       That's how they know you are you and that's what they can say, this is a drug, this is an intervention that will work for you. When we do that, then we're going to have to sequence everybody. So we're going to have about 2 billion people have had their whole genome sequenced, a within a within a decade, and then we're going to be able to compare what the genes say to how those are expressed and then

Speaker 3:          00:17:50       humans become a big data set and that's going to move us from precision to predictive healthcare where you're going to be just born and you're going to have all this information or your parents have all this stuff about how certain really important aspects of your life are going to play on. Some of that is going to be disease-related, but some of that's going to be life related. Like you have a better than average chance of being really great at math or having a high Iq, low Iq or being a great sprinter and how do we think about that? And then again, a revolution that's already happening, we're going is going to change the way we make babies. We're going to get away from sex as the primary mechanism for conceiving. Our kids will still have sex for all the great reasons we do. And that's going to open up a whole new world of a gist of how, of applying science to what it means to be a human with a lot of new possibilities.

Speaker 3:          00:18:38       That's what's going to be so freaky when people stop having sex to my kids and they make friends in the lab. Every kid's made in the lab when not only that, I think we're going to move to an era, an era where people who have, who make babies through sex will be seen as taking a risk, kind of like people who don't vaccinate their kids where it's natural. Tonight it's more natural to not vaccinate your kids then to do it, but people say, wait a second, you're taking on a risk on behalf of your kids. About 3% of all kids in the world are born with some kind of harmful genetic abnormality using in vitro fertilization and embryo screening. That 3% can be brought down significantly and what happens if you see somebody 20 years from now who has a kid with one of those preventable diseases? Do you think that's fate already? Think well on, wait a second. Those parents, they made an ideological decision about how they want it to conceive their kids. So I think we're moving towards some really deep and fundamental changes. Hmm. Well, yeah, that's, that's an interesting conversation of whether or not

Speaker 3:          00:19:43       you wonder what if we're ever going to get to a point where people don't allow people sort of like, people don't allow people to not get vaccinated. Right. And like there's a lot of that going on today, right?

Speaker 3:          00:19:55       Which is great, right? You don't want diseases floating around. But what if that gets to the place where we do that with people, with people creating new life forms? What have you say, hey, you aren't being irresponsible. You're just having sex and having a kid. Yeah, I know that's your grandma did it. We don't do it that way in 2099. Yeah. I think it's going to be hard to do that in a society like the United States, but in a country like North Korea, they'll be able to do that. Or if a country, if they said, look, um, you can make babies however you want, but if you make babies the old fashioned way and if you have some kind of genetic you, your kid has some kind of genetic disorder that was preventable, we're just not going to cover it with insurance. So you're going to have a $10 million lifetime bill.

Speaker 3:          00:20:40       You don't need to, you don't need to require something. You can create an environment where people's behaviors will change. And then there, there will be increasing social pressures. I mean, right now, you know, somebody sees some little kid riding around their bicycle without a helmet. They're kind of looking at the parents like, Hey, what are you doing? How come you're, you're, you don't have a helmet on your kids. And I just think that we're moving toward this kind of societal change where people will, I believe, see, uh, conceiving their kids in the lab as a safer, safer alternative. And it's not just safety. Because once you do that, then that opens you up to the possibility of all other kinds of, of applications of, of technology. Not just not just to eliminate risks or prevent disease, but you have a lot more information. So already it's possible to, to roughly rank order 15 preimplantation embryos, tallest to shortest in a decade from highest a genetic component of Iq to lowest genetic component of Iq.

Speaker 3:          00:21:39       I mean this stuff is very real and it's very personal. What do you think will be the first thing that people start manipulating? I think certainly health health is, will be the primary driver because that's every parents biggest fear and that's, that is what is going to be kind of the entry application. People wanting to make sure that their kids don't suffer from terrible genetic diseases. And then I think the second will probably be longevity. Me Right now there's a lot of work going, uh, they're going on sequencing people, the super agers people who live to their late nineties people do a hundred to identify what are the genetic patterns that these people have. So it's like to live to 90, you have to do all the things that you advocate, healthy living and whatever. But to live to into a hundred, you really need the genetics to make that possible.

Speaker 3:          00:22:25       So we're going to identify what are some of the genetic patterns that allow you to live those kinds of, of long lines. But then after that, then it's wide open. I mean it's, it's higher genetic component of Iq, outgoing personality, faster sprinter. I mean we are humans, we are primarily genetic beings and we're going to be able to look under the hood of what it means to be human and we'll have these incredible choices. And, and we have, it's a huge responsibility. How long do you think before we have a person with forearms? I think it's going to take a long time. Couple hundred years. Well, the thing is, here's how I see it. So the real driver, there's two, two primary drivers. One will be embryo selection. Um, so right now, average woman going through IVF has about 15 eggs extracted. Um, and then in IVF, in vitro fertilization, those eggs are fertilized using the male sperm and an average male ejaculation, there's about a billion sperms.

Speaker 3:          00:23:24       So, so men are just given it away. Women now, human female mammals are a little bit, or a little bit stingy, but then the next killer application is using a process called induced pluripotent stem cells. And so Shinya Yamanaka these great a Japanese scientist won the 2012 Nobel prize for developing a way to turn any adult cell into a stem cell. So a stem cells are kind of cell, it can be anything. Um, and so you take, let's say a skin graft that has millions of cells. You induce those, those adult skin cells into stem cells. You use these four things called Yamanaka factors. And so now you have, let's call it a hundred thousand stem cells, and then you can induce those cells into egg precursor cells and then eggs. So all of a sudden humans are creating eggs like salmon on this huge scale. So you have 100,000 eggs, fertilize them with the male sperm in a machine and automated process.

Speaker 3:          00:24:21       You grow them for about five days and then you sequence cells extracted from each one of those. And the cost of genome sequencing in 2003 it was $1 billion and now it's $800 it's going to be next to nothing within a decade. And then you have real options cause then you get this of this whole spreadsheet and algorithm and then you go to the parents. They will, what are your priorities? And maybe they'll say, well I want health, I want longevity, I want high Iq. When you're choosing from big numbers like that, you have some real options. And then on top of that, then there is this precision gene editing the stuff that happened in, in China last year. And I think it will, it will be in the re coming back to your question about forearms, I think it's going to be varied. People have this idea that tools like CRISPR going abused, someone's going to sit at a computer and say like forearms and three heads and wings and whatever.

Speaker 3:          00:25:11       But it's pretty hard because, um, human biology is incredibly complicated and we, we, we always know more, um, the worth, the very beginning of understanding the full complexity of human biology enough to make these big kind of changes. But if you're choosing from 100,000 fertilized eggs, those are all your natural kids. Yeah. And then you would get the best of that and then work on those. Exactly. And that's exactly the amount. And you get that. And then you say, all right, what if you had like 20 sons that were awesome and they didn't tell you about 18 of them and you kept two of them than 18 of them shipped off to some military industrial complex. Yeah. Turned them into assassins. Any kind of crazy thing you can think of. That's the problem, right? It's all this stuff will be possible. And so, and a lot of technologies, you can imagine all kinds of crazy stuff.

Speaker 3:          00:25:59       And that's coming back to your earlier point about regulation is we want to live in regulated environments. I mean, so like now think of the Internet and heal in the beginning days of the Internet. People Thought, oh, just let the Internet be let you know, just let it play out. It's going to liberate all of us. And now China's showing how the Internet can be actually be really actively used to suppress people. Facebook is, is taking people's information in Google in a way that's frightening. A lot of people and peers are saying, hey, it shouldn't be that these companies can do whatever they want. We have to have some way of establishing limits because not every individual is able to entirely protect themselves. They don't have the power, they don't have all the information. We need some representatives helping us with the real concern is the competition.

Speaker 3:          00:26:40       Right? The real concern is whether or not we do something with reg in regards to regulation. That's somehow another stifles competition on our end and doesn't allow us to compete with Russia and China, particularly China. Yeah, that's exactly right. And so, um, what we need to do is to find that balance. And one of the big issues, uh, for this is privacy. So if you kind of look around the world, I'd say there's of the, of the kind of the big countries in groupings of countries, there's three models of privacy. There's Europe, which has the strongest privacy protections for all kinds of data, including genetic, did a data. There's China that has the weakest and there's the United States that has the middle. And the paradox is from an individual perspective, we are all are thinking, well we kind of want to be like Europe because I don't want somebody accessing my personal information, especially my genetic information.

Speaker 3:          00:27:27       This is like my most intimate information. But genetics is the ultimate big data problem. And so you need these big data pools and you'd access to the these big data pools in order to unlock the secrets of genetics. So these three different groupings, everyone's making a huge bet on the future and the way we're going to know who wins. Like right now in the, in the it world we have Amazon and apple and Google and those big companies, but whoever gets this bet, right? They will be the ones who will be leading the way and making a huge amount of of money on these technologies because we were talking about is, is trillion multi-trillion dollar industry. How do you think this is going to affect things like competitive athletics? Hugely. So, um, right now, um, we have this problem, someone like Lance Armstrong cause he was doing, he's manipulating his, uh, his body and what he's basically doing is adding more red blood cells so that he can carry more oxygen and people feel that that's cheating.

Speaker 3:          00:28:27       And it's a, it's a different topic that probably everybody in the Tour de France was doing exactly that when he, when he went. Um, but what if it, which will be the case, we're going to be able to sequence the people would say nobody's doing drugs and we sequence all these athletes, some of them will just have a natural genetic advantage. Their bodies will naturally be doing what Lamstar Lance Armstrong had manipulated his body to. Do you know, that's happening with a sprinter right now? Yeah. Well that females prints this has high levels of testosterone. Yeah. No. And it's, and I feel really sorry for her, but we have categories. I mean, yeah, you with your world and in mixed martial arts, I mean I think I remembered in the past there was some person who has, who was kind of a borderline, uh, between genders and was just kicking the shit out of all of these women in cage fighting.

Speaker 3:          00:29:17       It's like we have these categories of man and woman and we know that the gender identities are, are fluid. But how do we think about it when these genetic differences confer advantages? So if your body is primed to do something, um, maybe you could have like a Plato's republic world where everybody fulfills a function that you are genetically optimized to and that you could imagine that being a very competitive kind of a, of environment. But what do you do if for now in something like the Olympics, if somebody has this huge genetic advantage, should we let somebody else manipulate their bodies? There's this thing called gene doping in order to change the expression of genes, so your body to act like you're as Jeanette naturally genetic enhances somebody else. It's complicated. Are they capable of doing certain physical enhancements through gene doping right now? Like what can they do right now known as?

Speaker 3:          00:30:11       So, so the way it works is so your, your genes instruct your cells to make proteins. That's, that's, that's how the whole system works. So you can change genes or you can trigger the expression of proteins so you can get people's bodies to behave as if they had the, these periodic optimization. Yeah. Yeah. And so that's why now the, the world antidoping agency, I mean, they are now starting to look at gene doping and this is the first time, uh, that, that's, that that's even being considered as a category. And then there are other people that have done that or other people that have done that successfully. You know, I don't know the answer to that. I know that water is looking for it, which makes me assume that it must have done, but I haven't seen it. I've looked for it. I haven't seen any reports.

Speaker 3:          00:30:59       Kind of starts winning everything, which know is so, so my, my, I wrote my, uh, one of my Psi Phi novels. Genesis code was about this. So China as you know, has their system of their Olympic sports goals. And the way it works is they test kids all around the country. So let's just say it's, it's diving and they identify what are the core skills of a diver, what do you need? And then they go around the country and they test kids and then they bring a bunch of them to the Olympic sports schools, uh, and then they, you know, they get them all involved and then some kids are the best of those kids and the best of those kids. And then you get with these champs, that's why China advanced. So, uh, so rapidly. But what happens if they're doing that? But it's at the genetic level and there are countries like Kazakhstan that are already announcing that they are going to be screening all of their athletes so that the science isn't there yet. So it's really, it's impossible right now to say, well, I'm going to do a genome sequence of somebody and I know this person has the potential to be an Olympic sprinter, but 10 years from now that's not going to be the case.

Speaker 2:          00:32:00       Wow. Yeah. It's sort of going to throw a monkey wrench into the whole idea of what is fair when it comes to athletics. Yeah. What is fair? What is human? What is human? Yeah. I mean, look, it's not like people don't already alter their bodies by training, by diet, exercise, all sorts of different recovery modalities, cryotherapy, song, uh, all of it. Um, you know, a high elevation training, all these different things that they do that manipulates the human body, but it's not like it would be kind of crazy if you had sports but you couldn't practice and he couldn't work out. Like we want to find out what a person's really like. No practice,

Speaker 3:          00:32:40       no working out. And that's the thing. It's like we are moving, it comes back to, we were saying before about nature. It's like we have this, this feeling nature somehow feels comfortable to us. That's what we're used to with all this stuff that you're talking about. But nobody was doing that 10,000 years ago. It's like, Hey, I'm, you know, I'm, I'm running after a buffalo and, and so and so as these boundaries change as the realm of possibility changes, then we're going to be faced with all of these questions. Even now look at a sport like competitive weightlifting. I know they have these like the, the real competitive bodybuilding and you see these guys and they're, they're monsters and then they have these drug free guys and everybody looks like a Yogi. And then it looks still a pretty big, pretty big but not compared to these, these other guys.

Speaker 3:          00:33:29       The only way to get those freak levels, it's just a romance. And so like how are we going to police this? And I think it's going to be very difficult. And so maybe we can have some kind of natural area of life, but I think that our, our model of what's normal is just going to change. Cause, like I was saying in the beginning, we set our baseline based on how we grew up and that it seems about right, like it seems about right to us that everybody gets immunizations. But immunizations are a form of superpower. Imagine if our ancestors, they couldn't even imagine immunizations. What an unfair advantage when you have 100 million people dying of, of Spanish flu. So we're with this, all this stuff is scary and it's going to normalize. But how it normalizes is, is that's what's it playing now? Well the world has changed so much just in the last 20 years, but it feels like this is just scratching the surface in comparison to what's coming.

Speaker 3:          00:34:23       It was a, people miss understand and they underestimate the rate of change. And the reason that they do that is since the beginning of the digital revolution, we have experienced the thing called exponential changes that you've heard of Moore's law, which is basically computing power roughly doubles every two years. And we've internalized Moore's law. And that means that every new iPhone we expect to be better and stronger and faster and all these kinds of things. But now we're entering in a world, a world where we're going to have exponential change across technology platforms. And so we think about, well what does exponential change mean in the context of biology? Well, at the very, very beginning it's genome sequencing is is is going to be basically a basically free, but we're going to be able to change life. And because we're on this j curve, like when you think of what's a 10 year unit of change looking in the in the rear view mirror, that amount of change is only going to take five years going forward and then two years and then one year.

Speaker 3:          00:35:24       And so that's the reason why I've written this book as I, as we have to get that this stuff is coming fast and if we want to be part of it, we have to understand it and we have to make our voices heard. What makes you nervous about this? Alright, three big areas. First humans and all advice. Incredibly complex. May We talk about genetic code, which is mindbogglingly complex, but our genetics exists within the incredible, incredibly complex systems biology. We have all these things like our microbiome, our virome are proteome are metabolome and then that exists within the context of our environment and everything's always changing and, and interacting. And so we are messing and we have the tools to mess and we will mess because we're this hubristic species with these really complex ecosystems, including ourselves. We don't fully understand. That's number one. Two, when you mentioned it before, this issue of, of equity, what happens if we have, every technology has to have first adopters.

Speaker 3:          00:36:26       If you don't have it, you never get the technology. But what happens if a group of people move much more quickly than other people, whether it's real or not, even if they believe it's real. You could imagine big, dangerous societal changes. And the third big area is diversity. And we think about diversity. We think why it's great to have diverse workplaces and schools and and we're more better people for it and we're more competitive. The diversity is something much, much, much deeper. In Darwinian terms, diversity is random mutation. Like that's our core survival strategy as a species. If we didn't have that, you could say we distilled be single cell organisms, but we wouldn't, we would have died because the environment would have changed and we wouldn't have had the builtin resilience to a doubt. Yeah. That is really important when you think about diversity, right?

Speaker 3:          00:37:10       Yeah. We need a non uniformity when it comes to our own biology. Yeah. Because he'd a bunch of different kinds of people. We have to have it big as, even if we optimize for this world, um, the world will change. There's no good and bad in evolution. There's just well suited for a particular environment. If that environment changes the best suited person for your old environment, maybe the least suited person for the new insurance. So even if we have things that seem real, like really great ideas now, like optimizing health. So if you have sickle cell disease, you're probably going to die and you're going to die young and it's going to be excruciating, excruciatingly painful. And so he would say, well, let's just get rid of sickle cell disease, which we can do. But if you are a recessive carrier of the [inaudible] of the sickle cell disease gene, you don't have it.

Speaker 3:          00:37:58       You're just carrying it. You have a pretty significant risk of passing it on to your kids, but you also have an additional resistance to malaria. And so we are probably are almost certainly carrying around all kinds of recessive traits, maybe even ones that we don't like that are harming us now. Um, but that could be some protection against some future danger that we don't yet understand or how or haven't faced. And so the challenge is that diversity has just happened to us for 4 billion years now we're going to have to choose it. And that's a big, it's a big challenge for us. So essentially we were going to have, without some

Speaker 2:          00:38:36       unintended consequences, some unintended domino effect, things that are going to take place that we really can't predict. We just have to kind of go along with this technology and see where it leads us as it improves. Like if you go back and look at surgeries from the 1950s comparison to surgery of 2019 giant leaps. I mean, I would never advise someone to get their knee operated by a 1950s physician. Right, right. Yeah. Right. But that's kind of someone's going to have to be an early adopter when it comes to these genetic therapies. Yeah, no. So I, I agree with you, but where I would slightly agree, I would add to what you're saying is these technologies, they're going to happen, they're going to play out what's at play now is not where these technologies are going to advance. They will, it will do, they will advance in a way that is going to just blow people's minds.

Speaker 2:          00:39:27       What's it play is what are the values that we are going to weave in to the decision making process so that we can get a better outcome than we otherwise would have had. And that that's what, in my view, that's the real, the important issue now. Yeah. Unintended consequences are something that I've been taken very seriously lately when I'm paying attention to technology as a, as it's used in social media, particularly. Uh, the one, one of the things is disturbed me quite a bit over the last few weeks is that there's a model that they use and not intentionally, but there's a model that they use to get people upset about things. Yeah. Show you things in your feed that you argue against because that makes you click on the more and engage in them more. And because of the fact that we have this advertiser based model where people were trying to get clicks because they want to get ads on their page and the more clicks they get, the more money they get from those ads.

Speaker 2:          00:40:25       And so they want to incentivize people to go there. And the best way through the algorithm would, what they've found without doing it on purpose is to get people upset and they're pushing people into these little information ghettos that are really dangerous. Right. And we've gotten to this point where this is just an accepted part of our lives. Did you go to check your Google feed or your Facebook feed and the, Oh boy, what the fuck are they doing? Is this real? They're going to pass this, God dammit. And then he'd get mad and then you engage with people online and then it results in more revenue. But getting them to stop that, if you had to go to Facebook and say, hey, hey mark Zuckerberg or now you have fucking $100 billion, whatever you got, but you can't make any more money this way. Right.

Speaker 2:          00:41:06       Because what you're doing is fucking up society. Cause you're encouraging dissent, you're encouraging people to be upset and arguments and you're doing it at great financial reward but great societal costs. Yeah. So stop. Yeah. And he's so do it. Right. Well he may not do it. That comes back to the point about regulation and the question is how big is your stick? And one of the guys who was the founder of [inaudible] is yes, is now coming out and saying, hey, Facebook needs to be broken up. And then he was one of the original founders and he's like, it has gotten so far out of hand. It's so far away from where it is. It's literally affecting global politics. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:41:39       Well it is. And so one option is to break it up that it seems to have worked pretty well with at and T. Um, another option is to regulate it, which I is, act in my mind would be a better approach. And that is to say, here's what's okay and here's what's not okay. And this stuff is really intricate. You have to really get down beneath these algorithms, which are unbelievably complex. But you're exactly right. I mean, what we're seeing now is we are being pushed into it. I said inflammation, ghettos, but it's like information barricades and so pushed into camps. And so, and it's so dangerous because the old, I mean this, this country is based on not everybody agreeing, but having a process where people come and they work it out and they say, you know, I'm not perfectly happy with this outcome, but here's a compromise and if we can't compromise and our civic culture is going to break down and there's so much, I mean, people don't see these pillars that are holding up our society. I'd lived in Cambodia for two years and if you don't have these civic pillars under your society, society's look very, very different. Everyone's life experiences. V We kind of take for granted. You can go out the door, walk to Starbucks and not get shot or a you can have your house. Something happened, your house gets robbed. You called the police and the police aren't the ones who've robbed your house or they're not in. I mean there's all these kinds of crazy things. If we break down the foundations that underpin our lives, that's really dangerous.

Speaker 2:          00:43:04       What I was kind of getting at was that through what this, this process of this algorithm, how this algorithm selects things for the you, your feed and how people are getting upset by this and how this is generating massive amounts of revenue once it's already happened. It's very difficult to stop and my concern would be that this would be a similar thing when it comes to genetic engineering. What we're saying, we need to be able to put regulations on this. We needed to be able to establish it. But once it gets out of the bag, once it gets rolling, and I have, you remember when Mark Zuckerberg sat in front of all those politicians, they had no fucking idea what they were talking about. You make money as such, Piss, poor prepares, and it just, it shows you like these are the people that are looking out for us.

Speaker 2:          00:43:46       Good fucking luck. These are Luddites. They're dumb asses. They're fools, right? And they're, they don't know anything about us. Some are better and worse, but yet almost everyone was underwhelming and under impressive in that hearing, in that hearing. Yeah. The fact that they're dealing with one of the most important moments of our time, but they didn't bring on some sort of a like legitimate technology expert who could explain it. Pitfalls. Yes. And do so in a way that the, the rest of the world's can, you know, so they're not going to protect us from genetic engineering either. Right. Because they're great generalists in terms of their education for the most part. And they're not, they're not concerned. This is not, they're concerned with raising money for their campaign. The concern with getting reelected. That's their concern with,

Speaker 3:          00:44:28       yeah, I totally agree with you that if we wait to focus on this issue until it becomes a crisis, it's going to be too late because all the big decisions will have been made. The reason why I wrote this book, the reason why, you know, I'm on my, it's almost week three of this book tour doing events like this every day is what I am saying in every form that I can is this is really important. You kind of, we were watching the news yesterday, they had this royal baby in in the UK. Like I don't give a shit. It doesn't affect my life in any but, but what does it play now is the future of our entire species and our democracy and our lives and we have to be focusing on those things because we have a moment now where we can it to a certain extent influence how these revolutions play out.

Speaker 3:          00:45:16       And if we just wait around, if we're distracted and we're focusing on all this stuff that's sucking up our attention and whether it's Trump or Brexit or molar and all these things, I mean, we're spent how much of our time are we spending focus on this? Fine, let's pay a little bit of attention, but there's really big stuff 50 years from now, a hundred years, and no one's going to look back and now say, oh, that was the age of Trump, or that was, they're going to say that was the age when after almost 4 billion years of evolution, humans took control of their own evolutionary process and it's huge and it's going to change all of life and of what I'm trying to do is to say everybody has to have a seat at the table. Whether you're a conservative Christian, whether you're a biohacking transhumanists, everybody needs to be at the table because we are talking about is the future of our species.

Speaker 3:          00:46:02       We're talking about the future of our species, but are we even capable of understanding the consequences of these actions to the stuff that we're discussing? Like right now, I'm not like I'm talking about it. If someone said, hey, you've got to go speak in front of people about the consequences of an a very clear one hour presentation, I'd be like, no, I'm not. Well, what I'm talking about one, we can go together. So you're good. Thank you. Um, but to the reason why I've written this book hacking Darwin is I wanted to say if you could read just one book, and it's written just for everybody in a very clear way with a lot of jokes that I think are funny. My mother laughed at them as well, that you get it. And then once you know, just the basics as a human being, anybody, it has an equal right to be part of this, of this conversation as the top scientist or the, the leaders of any of any countries that they would agree with you there.

Speaker 3:          00:46:53       But I don't think that other people are going to see it that way. I think the people that are in control, they're not going to say, hey, we need to find it. We need to be fair with everyone. All the citizens, the world. How do you feel we should proceed? No, but that's why we have to, that's why we need this bottom up ground swell. But we can't have a bottom up ground swell if people, if just general people aren't even aware of what the issues are and that's, that's the challenge. And that's why forums like yours or are just so important. I mean, you have all of these people and then you know, maybe everyone doesn't listen to this podcast. Say, all right, I get it. I can go give that hour long speech. But you can read a couple books and then you can give an an hour speech because the issues like, yes, there are scientific issues, but this isn't a conversation about science.

Speaker 3:          00:47:35       This is about values and ethics and our future. And it has to be a conversation for everybody. Yeah. It's not just a scientific conversation. It's a conversation about the future of the species and the species will be awesome. Yeah. And that's something we're wholly unqualified. No, it's you, but here's, here's a little vote for optimism. Okay. We have never been this literate as a species room. We've never been this educated. I don't think it was or if we ever been this nice either. Well I hope so. I really do. When you look at it, all the wars and all the murder that used to happen, it's actually a, this is the best time ever to be alive. Still Sucks for people that are in bad situations, but it's on average it's better. And we've never been this connected. So we have, so I, I'm the book I call for a species wide dialogue on the future of human genetic engineering.

Speaker 3:          00:48:20       You think of one that's nuts. 7 billion people on Earth. How are they going to, how are they going to do that? But we have the opportunity and we have to try because you don't want, like with the beginning of the genetically modified crops era, the scientists were actually really responsible, but regular people weren't consulted and they felt that these guys just did it to me. So if you have all the marchers with genetically modified organisms, we are entering the era of genetically modified humans and that's going to scare the shit out of people. And so we need to start preparing and we need to make people feel that they're respected and included and our government leaders aren't going to do it for us. So we have to find ways of engaging ourselves. And that's why with me with the book, I set up a website where people can, um, can share their views, debate with other people.

Speaker 3:          00:49:07       I really want everybody to be part of this conversation. How do you think it's going to play out in terms of how people, various religions perceive this? Yeah, so there's a real variation. So there are people on one end of the spectrum who believe that this is quote unquote playing God. And if you believe that the world was created exactly as it is by some kind of, uh, of divine force, um, and that it's wrong for humans to change to, to quote unquote play God, it's hard to explain how you could justify everything that we've done. I mean we've changed the face of this, uh, of life on this planet earth. But I really respect people who say, look, I think that there's a line that, you know, the, I believe that life begins at conception and that any kind of manipulation after conception is interfering.

Speaker 3:          00:49:57       That's going too far. And I respect that. Um, and those people need to have a seat at the table. Um, and that's in there certainly very strong religious views in Judaism. There's an idea called Tikun Olam, which means that the world is created, cracked and broken, and it's the responsibility of each person to try to fix it. And that's a justification for using science and doing things to try to make the world a better place. And then there are now these new kind of, I mean, transhumanism, it's almost like a religion. It's this religion of science. And so

Speaker 1:          00:50:28       we're going to have, we're humans, we're so diverse. We are going to have this level of diversity. And the challenge is how do we make, how do we have a process that brings, brings everybody in. But it's, it's tough. So when we're talking about genetic, any sort of genetic manipulation, we're basically talking about doing stuff to the wet ware, doing stuff to the biology. Right. What do you think about symbiotic interactions with technology? Because one of the things that I'm concerned with more than anything is this sort of inevitable path of technology getting into our bodies, whether it's through nanobots fixed diseases or through implementation. When we were talking yesterday about chips, right? Like what would, what would they have to do to get you to get up, put a chip in your body? Like what, what kind of powers would it have to have before you accepted it?

Speaker 1:          00:51:18       Yeah. Well, people already doing it in Sweden. Yeah, sure. And so are they doing in Sweden? Yeah, they're just, they're putting this little chips in their hands in there and under their skin and they're using it to open doors and access things. Um, so it's just starting. So I definitely believe the, you know, right now you look at, we look at photographs of our parents and you like God, look at your hair or your clothes. That's crazy. Definitely. I think that, you know, 20 years from now, 30 years from now, people are going to look at pictures of us and you say, what's that little rectangular thing? And you're going to say that was a phone what? And they'll say what it's like, yeah we used to carry it around in our pocket and like Michael Douglas, when you watch him in that movie Wall Street, he's got that giant phone.

Speaker 1:          00:51:55       The beach. Exactly. So we are, we are all, we are all Michael Douglas because our technology, you're absolute right is not going to be something that we carry around. It's technology is coming inside of our bodies. That is the future of where it's going. And you know, people say, well what, what is human genetic engineering have to do when we know that AI is going to get more and more powerful. But the future of technology feature of all of this, it's not human or AI, it's human plus Ai. And that is what's going to drive our, we are co evolving with our technology and that's what's going to drive our drive us forward. But you're exactly right to be afraid. And to be concerned. And again, everything has a little, how are we going to regulate it? What are we going to have guard rails of, how far is too far?

Speaker 1:          00:52:41       We going to let companies just do whatever they want. Are we going to put restrictions on what they can do? I think letting the whole world decide though, you're, you're gonna run into those religious roadblocks if for sure. And that's, and that's the challenge, is that the science is advancing exponentially. Whatever we do. And so we have to have our understanding of the science needs to at least try to keep pace regulations need to keep up on part of the World Health Organization, International Advisory Committee on human genome editing. So we're meeting six times this year in Geneva. And the question that we're asking is how do we think about global regulation, at least to try to put limits on the far ends of what's possible. And it's, it's really, really difficult.

Speaker 3:          00:53:26       But that's why we need to have this kind of process. And it seems impossibly ambitious, but every crazy idea, it has to begin somewhere. So you're doing every couple months. Yeah. Yes. Wow. Yeah. Cause they'd want to be on top of it as things change. Well that's the goal. It's just, it's so hard because almost impossible. It's impossible and simple. So I said that's why even the World Health Organization, which is the lead Health Organization of the United Nations, it's not enough if the task is so much bigger. And that's why we need to have this kind of gripped bottom of groundswell that I'm pushing for. And you're absolutely right when he said before, like, because there's not a crisis, people are focusing on other things. Open any news site, like what do you see? It's not like the really important stuff. It's, you know, Trump did this or Kardashians did that. And like we're in this culture where there are a lot of draws on our attention, but sometimes there's really important stuff and people are afraid of it.

Speaker 3:          00:54:23       People are afraid of science. People feel like, I remember science from high school. I didn't like it. I was uncomfortable. Um, you know, this is, this is for technical people and I just feel like we can't, science is so deeply transforming the world. Not just around us but within us. And so we have to understand it and people who are explaining science like me, the onus is on us. Like if somebody reads my book and says, well that was really dense, that was too hard. Like that's my failure. Like I was giving a talk in New York a couple of, a couple of weeks ago and so I gave my my talk and I try to make this really accessible for people. People were all jazzed up, they got it. And then there was this wonderful guys, brilliant senior scientist at this myth, this major stem cell research center. And so the, the, the host said, all right, Jamie just talked, um, can you sign it?

Speaker 3:          00:55:15       Can you give us a little background on the science? This guy knows so much. And he started going and it was very technical and you could just like get to see the faces of the people in the audience. He was like, Oh God, what's happening here? And just like their level of excitement, it's just shrunk because it couldn't really cook. And scientists, scientists aren't trained by and large to communicate. And to see in the fisheries. So a little more than a month ago, I was in Kyoto in Japan and I went to the laboratory of the world's leading scientists who's doing a process of what I mentioned earlier of turning adult cells into stem cells into eggs. And so this, this will revolutionize the way humans reproduce. And so I had, it was in a meeting, um, with his, uh, top postdoc students. So these are like really the cutting edge of these technologies. And I went around to each of them and I said, here's my question. I have two questions for each of you. One, tell me what you're doing now and to tell me what are the implications of what you're doing now for 50 years from now. And the furniture, the first question goes, oh, I'm doing this and we're doing this with mouse models. And people were so animated. And then 50 from now, people just froze.

Speaker 1:          00:56:24       And it was so uncomfortably. They were like squeezing the table just because that's not what scientists do. They're trained to say, well, this is the thing just in front of me. So I thought I was writing this book for the general public, but I'm being invited to speak to thousands of doctors and scientists because what they're saying is we get that we're doing this little piece of this in, whether it's lab research or fertility doctors or all sorts of things, but it's really hard to put together the whole story of the genetics revolution and what it means for us and for society. Yeah, man, that is interesting about scientists, right? They're just concentrate on the task at hand. Yeah. I mean it wasn't that, that was like one of the big concerns about the Manhattan project, right? This is the task. The task is how do you figure out how to do it.

Speaker 1:          00:57:08       So they figured out how to do it, not the eventual in yes. Consequence. So when Robert Oppenheimer, who was the, the lead of the, of the Manhattan project, when that first bomb went off, I mean he has his, his famous quote. It exactly. You mean they, the Co English common translation was Holy Shit, what have we done? And, and that's, and this science is real, but it's not going to be, it's not one person doing it. I mean that's the whole like science has been diffused at least with with nuclear power. It was a relatively small number of people and it was a one or two states that could do it. Now with with precision gene editing, I mean you get the Nobel prize for, for figuring out how to do and you will get the Nobel prize for figuring out how to do CRISPR gene edits, but to apply it once the formula already exists, you get like an a minus in your high school biology class.

Speaker 1:          00:58:07       So this technology is out there. It's cheap, it's accessible. Did you go to the 2045 conference in Manhattan a couple of years back? Now, do you know about all that? 2040 for that's, that's part of the thing with these transhumanists folks. They believe that with their own calculations of the exponential inclusive technology that somewhere around 24 does a singularity. Yeah. At the very least, we're going to reach this point where you're going to be able to either download consciousness or have some sort of an artificially intelligent sentient chains hanging out with you. Yeah, so it's, I'm involved, I'm on faculty for um, one of the programs of singularity university called exponential medicine. And so we're thinking a lot about that. Actually had an editor on the New York Times a few weeks ago imagining a visit to a fertility clinic in the year 20, 45. And again, because we were on this exponential change is it's really hard for people to, to internalize, to kind of feel how fast these changes are coming.

Speaker 1:          00:59:08       I do think though, Ray Kurzweil, who's, who's a really incredible genius, he thinks that we are soon going to get to a point now where our artificial intelligence is self learning. Because when you think about it, Ai, if it gets to the point where it can read something, read and comprehend, like in seconds, it will read every book ever written in Cuban history. And then it's when you have all these doublings and all of this more knowledge, you can imagine how that would happen pretty quickly. The counterargument against, and I think that it will, but I don't think that we're the, that our human brains are, on one hand, they're incredibly complex and they're also kind of irrational. I mean, we have all these different layers. You have our lizard brain and every decision that we make, there's the rational decision. But then there's all the other stuff that our brains, that doesn't even rise to the level of our awareness that our, that our brains are processing.

Speaker 1:          01:00:00       And right now we only really have one really effective artificial intelligence algorithm, which is for pattern recognition. But I think if you think of pattern recognition as a core skill of what our brains do, our brain's probably have a thousand, 2000 different skills. Um, but the core thing is whether we reached this singularity moment or not, these technologies are going to become incredibly more powerful. They're going to become increasingly integrated into our lives and into our beings. And part of our evolutionary process. There's no longer, oh, we just have our biological evolution and our technological evolution, and those are separate things. They're connected. It's going to be the weird question of whether or not, if an artificial intelligence is going to be able to absorb all of the writing that human beings have ever done and really understand us. Yeah. Well, they really still be able to understand those just because they get all the writing.

Speaker 1:          01:00:49       So right now you would say no. I would say no. Yeah. But 20 years from now, 50 years from now, a hundred years from now, they could come up with a reasonable facsimile. I mean, yeah, they could figure out a way to get it close enough. Yeah, I know where it's like her, like the, yeah. Yeah. That's an essential point because I think when people imagine this AI future, they're imagining like some intimate relationship with some artificial intelligent, intelligent, that feels just like a human. I don't think that's going to happen because it's its own one. No. But just because Ai, it will be its own form of intelligence. And it may not be, frankly, you wouldn't want ais with these brains like we have that have all these different impulses that are kind of imagining all this, this crazy stuff. We're, we may want them to be more rational than, than we are.

Speaker 1:          01:01:35       So like chimpanzees or our close relatives, they don't think just like us, we're not, you know, we're not expecting them to think like, cause they're their own thing. And I think AI's will be there on things. Will we be interacting with them? Will we be having sex with them? Yes. But if they are there, it's not going to be that. They're just like us. We're going to, they're going to be these things that live within us, live with us, and together we're going to evolve. Well, they're certainly already better at doing certain things like playing chess. And it took a long time for an artificial intelligence to be able to compete against a real chess master. But now they swamped them. Yeah. So say learn quickly can incredibly quickly they teach themselves. Yeah. So, so first we had chess in chess. People said, oh, that's what it means to be a human.

Speaker 1:          01:02:22       The computers will never beat humans at chess. Now it's like everyone says, well no human could ever compete. And then they said, well there's this Chinese game of go, which kind of when people hear look at it, it looks kind of like checkers but it's actually way more sophisticated. Way More complicated than chess. I heard that there are more moves in go, more potential moves and there are stars in the universe. Yes. So so then they had Alphago that this, this uh, company deep mind, which was later acquired by Google. They built this algorithm that in 2016 defeated the world champions of going, people thought that was, we were decades away. And then deep mind created this new program called Alpha Zero Alpha zero with Alpha go. They gave it access to all of the digitized games of go. So it, it very quickly was able to learn from how everybody else had played go alpha zero.

Speaker 1:          01:03:15       They just said, here are the basic rules of go and they let alpha go. Just play against itself with no other experience other than here are the rules and play against. And in four days, Alpha zero destroyed Alphago and then Alf and Ned Alpha zero destroyed the world champions of chess and destroyed every other computer program that had ever played chess. And this again, those computer programs had internalized all of the chess games of grandmasters. Alpha zero had not internalized any, it just played against itself for a few days. And then Shogi, which is a Japanese traditional game, kind of like chess, it destroyed the grandmasters of that. So that's what I'm saying is that these, the world is changing. It's changing so much faster than we anticipate and we have to be as ready for that as we can. I think we need to come to grips with the fact that we're way stupider than we think.

Speaker 1:          01:04:11       Who are we, what we think we're really intelligent and we are in comparison to everything else on this planet. Yeah. But in comparison to what is possible, we are really fucking dumb in comparison to what this computer can do and what the f the future of that computers. And what maybe that computer's going to redesign another computer. And I'm, again, this is good, but I've got some, I got some hiccups here. Yeah, no, it's true. And yet the technology is us. It's like this taste, these not like this technology, some alien force. We've, it's like this. It's like we create art. We create. We could, yeah. You use that. You mentioned cities and are like, we create these cities, which are these incredible places where dreams can happen to cities like here in Los Angeles or New York where, where, where I'm from. So this technology is us and the challenge is how can we make sure that this technology serves our needs rather than undermines our needs.

Speaker 1:          01:05:01       Yeah. And whether or not our needs supersede the needs of the human race or supersedes the needs of the planet. Yeah. It's, we're, we're almost too much champ, right. To contemplate these critical decisions in terms of like what, how it's going to unfold from here on out. Yeah. We really might not we, but the people that are actually at the tip of the spear of this stuff, they really might be effecting the way the planet is shaped and years from now. And we're doing that now. I mean we are, there is an article came out the other day. There's a million species that are on the verge of extinction. We already driving all these other species to extinction where warming the planet. So this is humans are that the determining factor in many ways for how this planet plays out. And that's why in my mind everything comes back to vows.

Speaker 1:          01:05:51       We, you're right, we have this, this lizard nature, this, this monkey nature. It's, it's who we are and that's, I mean you wouldn't want to take that away because that's the core of, of, of what we are. And yet we are also a species that has created philosophy. We've created beautiful religions in traditions and art. And the question is, which version of us is going to lead us into the future if it's this tribal primate with these urges, like that's really frightening. If we can say, you know, we've done better and worse in history and we had this terrible second world war and yet at the end of the Second World War with American leadership, the world came together. We established at United Nations, we established these concepts of human rights. Like you can't just kill everybody in your own country and say, hey, it's, it's just my business.

Speaker 1:          01:06:41       So we have this capability, but it's always a struggle and we of these forces are always at war with each other in many ways. It's just too much to think about. Yeah. Well we have, I know we do have to. One of the things that has always been amusing to me is that we seem to have this insatiable desire to improve things, and I've always wondered why I like it, but is that maybe because this is what human beings are here for? It's what we do. It's who we are, right? Yeah. But this is a product. It's just a US being intelligent, trying to survive against nature and predators and weather and all the, all the different issues that we came up that we evolved growing up and dealing with. And then now we just want things to be better. We just want things to be more convenient, faster, but more data.

Speaker 1:          01:07:33       Uh, you, you're aware of Elon Musk's neuro link check technology. How much do you know about it? I know a decent amount of, my friend Brian Johnson, he has a company, kernel. There's a few different companies that are trying to think about these brain machine interfaces and what are they trying to do? Basically what they're trying to do is to find a way to connect our brains to our machines. And there's a little bit of of progress from our brains are, they're incredibly complicated and they're messy. I mean, if there, there's a lot that's that, that, that's happening. But we are increasingly figuring out how to connect our brains to our technology. And so people are imagining a time when we can do things like download, download, download ideas

Speaker 3:          01:08:16       or Upload Memories and upload it. Isn't there some very early science that is suggesting that this will be possible, but it's, it's still the very early days, the very early days. But Ilan was giving the impression that some time this year they're going to release something. You know, they may release something, but it's not going to be something that's going to change the world because there's this, that technology is way more nascent than even the genetics technology that, um, that I've been talking about. So it's not like that there's that, that at all remotely possible that this year you're going to be able to like upload a full memory or download a full memory. But there, there are little things that are happening, but every, every journey begins with a step. But the technology is fairly transparent as term in terms of like where the state of the art is right now. It is in that it's extremely early.

Speaker 3:          01:09:07       This stuff is real. So when you think of like about systems that we understand, I mentioned that we, you know, we understand just a little bit about genomics. Um, we know less about the brain. The brain is kind of the great unknown of this unit. We know more about the oceans than we know about our brain. I mean he says, we know very, very little. We understand that if you kind of stick an electric current in somebody's brain, like that's going to have you, if you kind of shoot a spike through somebody's head, but really understanding how the brain functions it, we're still in the very, very early days. So do you think the Kurzweils off with this idea that you're going to be able to download your consciousness into a computer? Cause that's one of the most controversial ideas that he's come up with. I think he's, I think he's off.

Speaker 3:          01:09:49       Um, based on your use of the word your, so I mentioned that a month ago I was in Kyoto and I was at this, um, at this stem cell lab, but I also went to another lab of a guy named Hiroshi Ishiguro, who's the world's leading humanoid robot assist. And so he's the guy who was on the cover of wired and he's created these robot avatars. And like I had a conversation with this, this robot woman Erica, and it was really interesting cause I could see that like if I would smile she'd smile and leaned forward. And if I had like a, you know, overexaggerated sad face, she'd like change her expression and she can have like, you know, basic basic conversations. But we're still a long way and so from, from having full robotics, but I had this for robotic human interactions, but I had this debate with Ishiguro and he was saying that he thought that the future of humanity was nonbiological, that we were going to kind of unload ourselves to these non biological entities and that is how we would gain our and mortality. And I, my arm, I argued something very different. I feel like we are biological beings. I think we'll fully integrate with our technology, but if we ever become entirely nonbiological, then that's not us. Either. We will have committed suicide as a species or these robots, or they will have killed us because even, let's just say

Speaker 1:          01:11:14       that I could download my entire consciousness to some kind of robot unless it's say that was possible. That robot would be me for that first exact moment when the transfer happened, but then beyond that, they wouldn't be me anymore because there would be a whole other set of of experience. But we're, but certainly our interaction, our connectivity with this tech is going to be greater. And so even if Kurzweil isn't exactly right, he's directionally right. Give, the problem would be that you would be locked if they downloaded your consciousness into some sort of a bank of computers somewhere. Right? Where are you if that's your consciousness, your consciousness is in these ones and Zeros. Yeah. I mean that's terrifying. Terrifying. As someone didn't like you and they said, I'm going to make one version of you suffer for all eternity. Download you while you sleep.

Speaker 1:          01:12:08       It's true, but I have something worse than that. Okay. Death. And so I think that nobody is going to say, well, I'm going to be Joe living a life or I'm going to like not be Joe and I'll just have my consciousness downloaded someplace else. And so if the comparison is, well, I've lived this life and I don't want to die. And so I'd rather kind of be here in some kind of version. And even if it's not me, does something really, I think some people will want that. Not Everybody, some people will, but they don't know what they're getting. Right. In terms of you don't know what that experience is going to be like. Yeah. Nor do you know if there is some sort of a chemical gateway that happens in the mind when you do expire and allows you to pass through to the other dimension that you're, your consciousness and your soul longs to travel to.

Speaker 1:          01:12:55       But no, you've, I hope I, you're right about that and my timing not right. I've written about this in my novel. It's like, yeah, but I think kind of when you're dead, you're just dead and the good news for you as well, just because I think that this kind of immortality comes because time stops time is this relative concept. And so at the moment that you die, that's immortality for you because time stops flowing for you. Time is, that's what Einstein taught us. Time is this relative concept. Other people, they're legitimately, and there's no way to prove it, feel that we have this soul and this soul can travel to other, other dimensions. I happen to believe that we are biological beings and our experience of the soul, whatever is connected to our biology, when our biology stops functioning, those experiences, whatever they are, stop being accessible at least to us.

Speaker 1:          01:13:42       Have you had any psychedelic experiences? I haven't and I was so tempted. We, we started the interview talking about my chocolate, shamanism, anything I haven't in bed. I was relaxed. I want to, I don't think so. And I'll tell you why. So I listened to the Michael Pale and interviews and he had his great conversation with Sam Harris. And I really think that this psilocybin stuff is Israel and just got decriminalized. I know in Denver, I was just there the other day. Um, but as I said before, I think that the ultimate drug is us and so for me, I would rather, and I definitely think that our awareness that does, he doesn't encompass everything that is knowable. Everything that we, that we could know, but we hem ourselves in and if we want to get out of, of those limitations, certainly drugs are ways that people have used for, for many thousands of years.

Speaker 1:          01:14:39       But when you take the drug, you're like taking the drug and then you're not taking the drug. Like I would rather, what does that mean? It's like if you're taking psilocybin, you're having this great experience, but then tomorrow you're not taking psilocybin and so kind of your consciousness has narrowed. My aspiration would be to recognize that the drug is us. Did we want to expand our consciousness? There are all kinds of ways, whether it's meditation or awareness or just you know, simple appreciation. That's when I do these cacao ceremonies. What I say is like, you have this Cacau in front of you, but it's not just this, like think of the person in Honduras who planted the seed, the person who watered that seat, the person who took the plant, the person who paved the road to bring the plan. And I just, I just think that we can expand our consciousness through our own means and then we always have access.

Speaker 1:          01:15:29       I hear what you're saying, but you're saying this from a person has never had certain experiences. It's really preposterous. You did experience what silicide can duty. Yeah. You definitely wouldn't be saying it this way. You also wouldn't be thinking then you take it and then you're not on it anymore because it's profoundly influential for the, your perspective in regards to the whole rest of your existence. There's many people that have had psychedelic experiences to think about it as a rebirth, that they've gone through this and changed. Yeah. So, but why would you have this rigid thought process about drugs and not drugs, but yet you don't have it about the cow, which is a mild drug. Yeah. And so I, you're right that it may not be entirely consistent. Some of the people you've described are good friends of mine who've really done it, and I've really, I've talked to them about it and I'm hung endlessly curious.

Speaker 1:          01:16:20       So why don't you do it? The reason is so far, I have been on this journey to see what's possible within myself and I'm still on that journey. I'm not, I don't want to close off any possibility for kind and assume that it would close things off. That's what's confusing. It's just opening you up to a new experience that other people found to be profoundly influential. Yeah. And Yeah. So, so far you're very resistant to this. Like you yeah. I'm talking to you like, yeah, yeah, yeah. Like you can't wait to come back and either their own rationale. You're funny. I will. I will come back to this perspective of a person who hasn't experienced anything. You're so right. And I think it's such a great point cause I'm very close with actually that with the Tibetans, one of my closest friends is the prime minister of the Tibet and exile government. So I've been many times to John Sala in, I've met with

Speaker 3:          01:17:10       his holiness the Dalai Lama many times and the most incredible thing about meeting with these guys and they, they are all people who've found these incredible states of heightened consciousness so much that their brains are changed when they go into the the FMRI machines. But when you have a conversation with them, it's not like what we do like. Exactly. And thank you for calling me out. Like you say something, I've already in my head countered what you're saying before you're finished saying, and I'm like why you kept saying exactly which part means that you made me a little uncomfortable, which is good. That's what we, what we want. And these guys, it's like you'd talk to them and they would just be so tuned in to what you were saying and they would just kind of think about it. Then you'd finish and then they'd kind of look up.

Speaker 3:          01:17:54       And then, because we're Americans, we want, you know, somebody stops speaking like you have to if you don't speak right away. And then there was like a minute and then it's like you're kind of looking around, was it me? Did I say? And then they would come back with this incredibly thoughtful thing. So I, you're right, you know, I don't want to close off any possibility. There are many different things that we could, uh, could do. The Path that I have been on and certainly with this [inaudible] right. Cacau is like a, a mild, I mean, not a huge one, but like a mild drug and life is a mild jog. Um, so the assignment is not very mild. Yeah, no. In my friends who have done it have said exactly what he said, they say, I have a, a good friend of mine who, uh, who did it. Um, and then he said it just, it showed me a path to a different identity, a different consciousness. And now he said, I don't do silicide Bun, but I do daily meditation, but I can see where I'd like to go, what's possible. So I, I get that.

Speaker 2:          01:18:54       Yeah. Yeah. There's a bunch of different substances out there that have very similar profound effects. Um, there's a real thought, and this is something that Terence Mckenna described way back in the late nineties, early two thousands, he believed that you're going to be able to recreate a lot of psychedelic states through virtual reality so that people that don't want to actually do a drug will be on, had to experience what it's like to be on that drug. And that, I mean, that's very theoretical and hypothetical and yes, you know, who knows whether or not that's possible, but that, that could be one other way that human beings interface with technology.

Speaker 3:          01:19:39       So humans, in my view, are far more hackable than we think that, that there are so many that we just imagine our biology is being fixed. But our biology is really variable. Like I have a, a friend, um, who's an anesthesiologist at Stanford and she's done this experimentation of just running, just like very mild electric currents through people's brains. And people have these very real experiences and whether it's arousal or something that it's,

Speaker 1:          01:20:08       that you're a, you're entering people's minds through different ways. So you, you talk about a, about virtual reality when we are entering a world where the pixelation of virtual reality will be equal to life and that, so you're going to be in this VR space and it's just, it will look, it may smell, it could eve with haptic suits. It may feel just like life and our brains, I don't know if you've done these things with the, these, um, uh, these, uh, VR glasses where you go and you can see people, you're just like in a, in a hall and the put on the glasses and now you're in an elevator going to the top on the outside, like a window cleaners elevator to the top of this, um, highrise and there's a little rickety board. And then there's this cat at the end of the board and they're saying, yeah, you have to go, go save the cat.

Speaker 1:          01:20:59       And you've already seen that. You're just in a hall. You know it in your brain. Um, there's this cat. Everybody's looking at you and you've seen all these other people panic. It's like, wow, when I'm there, I'm going to be, so I'm just going to go grab that cat. And you're terrified. Like you're trying to override your lizard brain and your lizard brain saying like, no, don't step up this. They'll have that for our HTC vive. Yeah, we need to set that up, Jim. We need a two by four we put on the ground. Well, it's incredible. And so I think that this whole concept of reality is at like that our technology is going to be changing our sense of reality. And then what's real, like if you feel arousal in your brain because of an electric current or you feel it because you're with your girlfriend or wife or reading a magazine or whatever, is that different?

Speaker 1:          01:21:47       Is One real and one not real? And I think that that's, there's real big issues here. General mean that is the Matrix, right? Yeah. I mean the idea that, and if it feels better and it's more enjoyable than real life, what is going to stop people from doing the Ray Kurzweil deal and downloading yourself into this, this dimension? Well, and not much. Whether it's possible to do a full download or not me, I think that's an open question, but whether people are going to be more comfortable living in these alternative worlds and whether we're booked, we're going to be able to say, oh no, that is the fake world. Like if you're in this virtual world, but your, do you have friends in that world, you're interacting in that world. You have experiences that feel every bit as real in that world as in our world and people say, oh no, that's not real.

Speaker 1:          01:22:37       Those, those aren't your friends. Like even now, like you know we all people with global lives, you kind of have these friends. Like I have a good friend in Mongolia. We talk all the time. Do you ever see them in person? Once it all hell like once every year or two. It's great to see him. That's a real person though. You know it's a, it's a real that someone who actually not like a pen. It was a control plane that you actually do know him. Gonna have to say. But if it was someone that you only talk to online and they lived in Mongolia, that's where things get weird. It's true. But let's just say hyper falling that hypothetical. You have that person, they're part of your whole life and you're there with you there. Are they with you through your life experiences? You call them up when you're sad.

Speaker 1:          01:23:14       Like is it so essential that you've met that person physically? Like is that the core of what it means to be someone's friend that you was not essential but it means a lot. It does. And I, and so I, I mean because we are not like we are these physical beings and we are these virtual beings. But figuring out what's the balance is going to be really tricky. Yeah. What is the balance? What I'm worried about augmented reality too. Cause I, you know, when you see people that you snapchat filters and give themselves doggy years and stuff like that, like yeah. Well how long before that is just something that people choose to turn on or turn off about life itself. Yeah. Like you'll be able to see the world through different lenses. The Sky, it could be a different color. The plants could be a different color.

Speaker 1:          01:24:02       Yeah. I write about this in one of my novels, Eternal Sonata, um, where I think we're just going to have these contact lenses and I'm, and it'll be different kinds of information based on what people want. I mean, like I'll meet with you and it'll say, all right, this is Joe, here's a little bit of background, whatever, and we'll have useful information. Or you're walking around a city and you'll be, get little alerts of things you might do or, or history. And so I think that that's what they were thinking about with Google glasses. Right? Yeah. I know. But he just was so annoying that he wanted to kill these two weird, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. It was just too, everybody felt like they were getting filmed. They were, when you were walking around with Google glasses on, you assume that people were recording everything.

Speaker 1:          01:24:43       It was very strange. But I think that's another thing that we're just, all of our lives are going to be recorded. Of course. Yeah. Now, do you think that that's going to come in the form of a contact lens or do you think it's going to come in the form of like ski goggles that you're going to put on and snowing where nobody wants to look like an idiot. And so in the beginning, no, but in the beginning, all of these, you talked about Michael Douglas with this or like that. My favorite one is, um, is Kurt Russell in escape from New York? What do you have there? It's like this really cool tech. Like he, he finally gets out of this Manhattan Hell and he's got this phone and it's like this big and it's so crazy cell phone. This freeze, it's like very, very early days. And so you know, now we have these kind of glasses and there's like a little bit of a little bit of Cachet, but all I'm has a cell phone that's that big.

Speaker 1:          01:25:28       It'd be seen that. No, I was at the Verizon store. Yeah, I think it's like an attachment. Earnest. An accessory to a phone. Yeah. You can bring it with you as intervention. Fine. Not Bring your other phone. That's the idea behind it. Yeah. So like you could decide, well I'm going out, let me just bring my tiny phone for essentials. All this tiny, I mean the funds are going to get quote unquote, phones are just going to get so smart. So I say they're going to come inside of it. So you'll have like a little contact lens, maybe a little thing in your ear. Maybe like a little permanent implant in your behind your tooth or one of your teeth. They'll replace a tooth with a computer. Well, you pipe it into your nerves. Any kinds of crazy stuff you can think of that it's probably going to happen.

Speaker 1:          01:26:06       And some of it, some of it will take, some of it won't. Right, right. Yeah, it seems like that's what we're going to have to see. Like how it plays out and that's one of the things when you were talking about scientists that are working on these things, they're working on what's right in front of them. They're not looking at the greater landscape itself in terms of what the future holds. It's not their job. And that's why we need other people and I certainly see myself or those people. You and who else, who would you elect if Trump came to you and said, Jamie, we've got problems when we need to figure out the future, what should we do? So was certainly the move. We need to have a mix of different kinds of people. And so I, I'm certainly people like me who are kind of big picture futurists.

Speaker 1:          01:26:44       We need that. We need scientists. I work with some really incredible sign. I did an event at Harvard last week with George Church who kind of like the Living Charles Darwin, David Sinclair, who you know has been on this program is a friend of mine working on life extension and we need people just from all backgrounds. And so like I would say like we need people, we need poor people, we need people from developing world. We need to all kinds of people. But in terms of the people who are kind of articulating the big picture of the world and what are the challenges that we're facing, I certainly put myself in that category. People like you've all Noah Harari, he was just kind of big also kind of big thinkers. People like Sid Mukherjee Am. I just think we have to articulate the big picture and we have to do it in a way so that people can see themselves in this story and then, and then enter into the conversation.

Speaker 1:          01:27:37       Are you writing this book? Just to sort of educate people and let them understand exactly what is going on and that it is a really volatile and chaotic and amazing time. And that all these things are, or are you, or are you doing this book too? But what are, what, what essentially was hacking Dharma look, what was the motivation behind it? Was it for a person like me or was it for the, the everyone like is for, for everyone. And so what I really wanted you to, so the background's give be gift. I can give you just a little bit of background. So more than 20 years ago I was working on the National Security Council and my then boss, um, Richard Clark, who was then this obscure White House official who is jumping up and down saying we need to be focusing on terrorism and al Qaeda and bin Laden. And he was trying to tell everybody and nobody was paying attention to is totally marginalized.

Speaker 1:          01:28:31       And when nine 11 happened and Dick's memo was on George Bush's desk saying exactly that we need to focus on al Qaeda, here's what's going to happen to, and Dick even before then would always tell me that if everyone in Washington was focusing on one thing, you can be sure there was something much more important that was being missed. And so more than 20 years ago, I was looking around, I saw all these little pieces of disparate information and I came to the conclusion that the genetics revolution was going to change everything. So I educated myself, I started writing articles. I was invited to testify before Congress and then to try to get that story out, I was, I started, I wrote my, my two most recent near term Scifi novels, Genesis Code and Eternal Sonata. And when I was on book tours for those, and I explained the science, uh, to people the way I kind of a self educated citizen scientist, um, and a novelist would explain the science, all of a sudden people got it.

Speaker 1:          01:29:22       And that was when I realized I needed to write a book about the genetics revolution that people could absorb that wouldn't scare people. But my mission for the book is that this stuff, as we've talked about, it's so important that everybody needs to be part of the conversation. We have this brief window and what I'm calling for is this species wide dialogue on the future of human genetic and genetic engineering. And I have a whole game plan, uh, in the book about what people can do, how they can get involved a people individually on a national level. We have to put a lot of pressure on our elected leaders and say, stop focusing on the crap. There is really important stuff that needs to be addressed and we need leadership. I'm going to, I'm speaking on, uh, in, uh, in Congress, um, or week and a half from now talking about about these dishes.

Speaker 1:          01:30:10       So we need to have an, on an international level, we have to have some kind of international system. We're so far away from being able to do that. We don't even know what the standards are, but we have to be pushing. And so I know you think of it in terms of like the same way we have with look nuclear weapons. Yeah. In a way. In many ways. Yeah. But the thing is with nuclear weapons, a lot of that happened at the state level, at the country level. This needs to happen at a popular level and at a, uh, at a government level. So the only way that those that's going to happen effectively is we need a real comprehensive education on the subject. It's not something that people can just guess. Right. You need to know what's the consequences, what, where we're at right now.

Speaker 1:          01:30:49       Yeah. Right. Yeah. And that's, and that's like Sanjay Gupta had a wonderful quote that's actually on the cover of my book, which is if you can read one book on the future of our species, this is it. So what I've tried to do is to say like, if you just want to go to one place to understand what's happening, what's at stake, what it means for you, and what you can do now. If you want to get an involved, I've tried to do that. But then ironically I'm now like, as I mentioned, being asked to speak to thousands of doctors and scientists because they're all reading this book and they're saying this is, this is positioning my work in a, in a much bigger context. Sanjaya goop does a very interesting cat cause he was very anti marijuana and then started doing research on it and then totally flipped 180 degrees.

Speaker 1:          01:31:28       Yeah. Which to me is a great sign of both humility and intelligence I recognize of the data was different than his presuppositions. Yeah. He had these prejudices that were very common. Yeah. Yeah. Now when you speak to Congress, what do you, do they brief you in terms of like what they would like specifically for you to address? No. So this one, um, it's um, I've been asked to go and speak in a lot of members of congress who are going to be invited. And what I'm going to tell them is, look, this is really important. Our congress is not doing enough and here are the things that we need to do. And what are you going to say to try to really get it into their head? What I'm gonna say is that the genetics revolution is here. If we don't have a system, if you don't have a rational system to manage it, if we don't have a system.

Speaker 1:          01:32:17       You talked about public education. The challenge that we faced in the United States is we traditionally have had a representative democracy and now we're transitioning from a representative democracy to a popular democracy. So Switzerland has a popular democracy, but they have like really well educated people who are able, who have enough information to make smart decisions. We have an educated our public and yet the public is making big decisions and a lot of it is happening just on a gut feeling. That's what's happening with trade agreements where people just have, I have a feeling it's bad without, you know, the ability to, to, to really get into the, into the details. And so we are having that transition, which means there's a lot of responsibility on us to educate our public and it's just, it's a tragedy. We treat people in this country. Like you can just throw people away like you somebody.

Speaker 1:          01:33:02       If you're in some crappy school system and you know your, your, your chances of success are so minimized, not because of anything that you've done just because of your circumstances and it's unacceptable. It is only, I mean, the equal opportunity is what we really should all strive for us. And I think some people conflate that with a op equal success and you're not going to get the same equality of outcome. You're going to get different, different amounts of ever and different people are qualified or more talented at different things. But what I'm worried about is what I said initially that some people are going to get ahold of this stuff quickly and it's going to give them an a massive advantage. Yes. Sort of like, I mean if you, the first person that has the ability to go forward in time, five minutes is going to be able to manipulate the stock market unprecedented way.

Speaker 1:          01:33:57       Yeah. I don't think that that's really possible in our lifetime, but that's the kind of thing I'm talking about. You could get so far ahead that if we're talking about competition, there will be no catching up. They'd big, you don't have to travel in time to do that. Right. But I'm saying if that was, if it was algae, but there's real technologies that are likely to happen which are going to confer billions, tens, hundreds of billions of dollars of benefit of advantage. Yeah. And that stuff is, is happening now. And this is the concern with getting behind countries like China cause if they get ahead of us or something like that, when they were already moving in this direction in terms of technology. Yeah. So I am a proud American. My father and grandparents came here as refugees. I believe in what this country at our best stands for.

Speaker 1:          01:34:42       I want us to continue to be the country that setting an example for the rest of the world that is articulating what our ideals of responsibility and governance, good governance and accountability and all these things that we've championed. And because of that, I want us to get our act together politically and I want us to be the leading technological country in the world. Um, and so I think that's what's, what's its taken. We're losing so much time because there was a time in the period after the Second World War where we recognize that technological leadership was the foundation for everything else we were, we had recreated the world out of the ashes of the, of the war. But we realized that we needed to have the economic growth. We needed to have the competition, we needed to have these technologies and we, it was a miracle.

Speaker 1:          01:35:29       What we've, what we've done and now we've lost our focus and we have to regain it. The way I look at humans and the way I look at the human race today in 2019 it's like we're driving very fast through fog and it's very difficult to see what's in front of us. Yep. When I look back at how long have you ever written any hg wells but some of his predictions about the future? Really interesting cause he, he, he was pretty close on quite a few things, but that that vision is to be able to sit there and use your imagination, close your eyes and think what is this going to be like, what is, what, what we're dealing with now and opposed to as opposed to what, 2119 right. What does, which is similar to the HG wells versus us. Right. What the fuck is that going to be like?

Speaker 1:          01:36:14       Like yeah. Is there going to be a time where there are no diseases there, there is no death and that we just have to regulate population control in some sort of a other manner and the only way people die, they're going to die from accidents and things along those lines. But, but mortality in terms of old age, I mean this is, that's a according to Davidson Claire, this is a fixable issue. Yeah. You know how to have, when they fix it, they fix it in 20 years or 30 years or 50 years. David is a friend and I and I have a whole chapter and shit. I don't want to misquote. Nice. I have a whole chapter in the book on the science of of human life extension. So I think definitely it's real that we going to live healthier longer. We're going to harness our technology if that.

Speaker 1:          01:36:58       I don't think that in mortality it that biological and mortality is in is in the cards. Maybe not in mortality because we'll still be biologically vulnerable with their hearts and brains on stuff, but aging, yeah, I think we will age slower and we will live healthier longer and I think it's, it's going to be great. The back to your ear core point. I mean that's the reason why I also write science fiction is that the world of science is changing so fast that we really need to apply a lot of imagination to imagine where it's going. Because if you're just looking at what's happening now, it's like this train is going to speed by, we have to kind of imagine, it's like Wayne Gretzky. We have to imagine where the puck is going to be, not where it is now. I mentioned George Church who's like, he's at Harvard, he's like the the Living Charles Darwin.

Speaker 1:          01:37:43       And I do a lot of speaking alongside George and it's become our little thing that he says that he reads, um, science fiction like mine. And then imagine says, well, that's pretty cool. How can we do that? And what I do is I look at the research coming out of labs like Georges and I sat, right? Well that's where we are now. What's that going to mean in 2050 100 years? And so we have to that the science fiction plays a more important role than it ever has and kind of imagining where we're going. And it's that imagining that allows us to try to say, well, what if that's one of the options of where we're going? What are the decisions that we need to make now so that we can have a better outcome rather than a worst one? If you're gambling person, I don't know if you are.

Speaker 1:          01:38:26       Yeah, but if I had to give you 100 bucks to put on something in 20 years, it's going to be profoundly just, it changed. It's going to change us in a way that is something that we're not really prepared to understand or deal with. What do you think that's going to be? I think it's going to be predictive genetics. They were going to have, all right now it's like you go to your doctor when you're sick. You could have been, this could have been some genetic disorder that you had from the moment you were conceived and it was ticking and it was ticking and you showed up 50 years later when that's been manifest. So it's going to be very different. You're taking your kid home from the hospital, your newborn, and the doctor says, Hey, congratulations. This is really great, but just Fyi now your kid has a 50% greater than average chance of getting early onset Alzheimer's 50 years from now and your cat.

Speaker 1:          01:39:24       Your kid has a really great chance of being phenomenal at abstract math. Like, how are we going to think about, how are we to think about what it means to be human when we have all of that information? And there are things now that we call fate and it's, it's, it's just a different model. And so I think that, and once we have that, that's gonna change a lot of a lot of things. It's going to fundamentally transform our health care. What we call healthcare now is really sick care. You show up with a symptom and this is going to be predictive and it's going to change the we, the way we make babies because people are going to have real choices about which embryos to implant. And we're going to have a lot of information about a re a lot of really intimate stuff.

Speaker 1:          01:40:02       So you feel like genetic manipulation and genetic engineering, genetic understanding, genetic knowledge, and then applied genetic medicine. Yeah. So those are going to be the big changes in the next 20 years, even more so than technology, which it's interconnected because these, there's really, it's like a super convergence of these technologies. So the the genetics revolution is the artificial intelligence revolution in a sense that the complexity of genetics is so great, it's way beyond what our brains on their own could process. And so really they're, all these technologies are touching each other and so the biological models are now influencing the AI. So for example, we are coming to the limits of silicon storage, but DNA has unlimited storage capacity. So it's the, the, the, as I've said before, the kind of the between biology and AI or genetics and AI is going to be very blurry.

Speaker 1:          01:40:58       Yeah. That is a, an interesting concept, right? The idea of storing information in DNA and that that has been discussed. Yeah. Which the DNA is the greatest information storage mechanism ever imagined that the question is what happens when you do store things in there and how does that information interact with all the rest of the stuff that's in your body already? Well, I mean if you can do it in your body, you could, doesn't have to be angels nearby body. Just think of like your, your DNA has 4 billion years of history and it's done a great job of recording it. It's incredible. I can, my, my old eight track tapes, they haven't lasted. That is a squirrely concept that you have all that data inside your head. I mean, that's also when people make, when they try to understand instincts yeah. That people have, that these are some sort of genetically encoded memories, right?

Speaker 1:          01:41:46       Some understanding of things that are dangerous and that these, the, they're in there because this is how we've learned over the years without actually having experienced these things personally. Yeah. Yeah. No. So that's, it's baked in. Our genetics are baked into us. And so, you know, I don't know if you've been to Indonesia, but while I was in Indonesia and I went to this place called Komodo island. Oh Wow. Well, the, like a motor guides. And it was fascinating because it's like you can tell they don't have plaintiff's attorney, so here's walking around. They're all these Komodo dragons. And so yeah, these are like the most deadly creatures on earth. And there's like some little guy with a little stick and it's like, well how effective is that stick? But the way it works, so you're just walking around just walking around. Cause they come over checks when they're not killing people or killing animals, they're just sitting there.

Speaker 1:          01:42:30       And so it's pretty scary. Do they ever get jack to people ever go there and get bitten and they, they say, oh it's that only a few times a year. It's like wow, a few times. Yeah, that seems like a lot. I was a year. There's a lot. But the way it works for a Komodo Dragon, mother lays the egg and then buries the egg and then forgets where the egg is. And then let's just say that this egg hatches and this little Komodo dragon comes out and the mother sees her own baby Komodo Dragon. She'll eat it in a second. Oh Jesus. And so if you're a Komodo Dragon, you better have your entire survival strategy baked into your DNA because nobody's teaching you anything. And so for us, we have this sense that it's like parenting is really important. It is environment is really important.

Speaker 1:          01:43:16       It is. But so much of who and what we are is baked in to our genetics and I think that's, that's going to be this challenge that we're going to see ourselves as increasingly genetic beings. We can't become genetic determinist think that we're just genetics, but we're going to know a lot more. We're going to demystify a lot of what it means to be human poop. Yeah, teeth is right, but are we going to lose the romance and the, the just the randomness of life because of that. That's what people are concerned with, right? Like if, if we have some sort of genetic uniformity, I mean especially in particularly with like things like intelligence

Speaker 3:          01:43:52       and athletic performance, we're not going to appreciate freaks as much or maybe we'll all want to be freaks. Freaks are the ones who push us into not going to want to be a moron. Well, your your question, it's, it's the essential question. It's like what makes a human a human isn't December. We have higher Iq that doesn't make you a better human that makes you someone with a higher Iq. But how are we going to think about constructing societies when it's up to us? Like if we are going to say we value certain people, certain ideas, I think we're going to need artists. Like right now people like artists are sometimes in the mainstream and sometime they're on the fringe, but artists are going to be maybe the most important people in this new world. And right, like right now in hospitals and we have kind of a hierarchy and like the most technical people are the people who are valued the most and the least technical people, like some of the nurses or nurse's aides are the people who are often valued and paid the least.

Speaker 3:          01:44:46       But when technology can do these technological feats, what's going to be left is how can we be great humans? How can we emote? How can we connect? How can we create art? And if we get swept away by this tide of science, as in, you know, how excited I am about the size a bit and we could really undermine our humanity, right? And as for humans, what humans value is many aspects of that humanity are the creations, the literature things. We, we, we, when you read someone's great pros, you're, you're reading like an insight into their mind. And that's what's interesting about it, right? He's like, yes, you're not going to get that from just ones and Zeros. Yeah. And that's, and there, there will always be this way we call it mystery. And even if we can do a genetic analysis of Shakespeare and Mozart and, and whatever, like it's still miraculous and we need to celebrate that.

Speaker 3:          01:45:43       And we can't, we can't allow us to say that we are just our genetics or even just our biology. But we also can't just say biology has nothing to do with it. And especially because we're going to know more about our biology and about our, our, our differences. And that's, that's normal. I mean it used to be in the old days that everyone thought, well God is weather and now we understand weather. Pretty much a, nobody is saying, oh that lightening, that's God is delivering a message. It could be, but we still like we still have that mystery and I think that it's in some ways it's about our orientation, like how do we make sure that we keep this view of life, that we have artists and humanists who are just at the core of this conversation about where we're going. What if that mystery ultimately turns out to just be ignorance and that as you develop more and more understand and there's less and less mystery, would we like to be less smart?

Speaker 3:          01:46:33       What we like to be the more overwhelmed by possibility? It could be. I think those would be part of what romance is. It could be and certainly like the unknown every we wake up every morning and we just don't know the answer. And there's some people like to going back to the issues of of life extension. There are some people who say, well that death is essential for appreciating life. I, I talk about this stuff all around. And then there are people who say you and you're talking about eliminating these terrible diseases, but I know somebody who had that terrible disease and their suffering was a gift to everybody else because we all had more humanity in response to their suffering. I look, well that's kind of screwed up. I'd prefer them to not have that suffering, but to those people were thinking wacky, it's Wacky, but we need to like, I totally agree with you that if we allow ourselves to get swept away with this kind of scientific determinism, if we don't say we really value our humanistic traditions are artists, our cultures, we could get lost and with have become obsolete, we could become obsolete, but we could also just become less human.

Speaker 3:          01:47:41       And there's something wonderful and there's magic. And do think that monkeys used to think, man, can't become a human. We become less monkey. You don't know what I'm saying. But no being looks in the mirror and recognizes that they are evolving here. We've what we've only been, homo sapiens are about 300,000 years. Right? Um, so we just, it's hard. We know where we've come from cause you, you see all those little charts from high school biology, but it's really hard for people to imagine being something else in the future. It's, it's, it's outside of our, of our consciousness. And So said she will square. Yeah. And we are monkeys. It just that we've redefined our monkey thing. You know, we do it with you in a little different way. That's what I was kind of getting out. Are you concerned at all with artificial life?

Speaker 3:          01:48:24       Are you concerned about the propagation of, of artificial intelligence? Well, there are different kinds of artificial life. So, um, one is artificial intelligence and I know people like Elon Musk and Stephen Hawking are, are afraid. Terrified. Yeah. And I think that, that we need, whether it's right or not, I think it's great for us to focus on those risks because if we just say, oh, that's, that's crazy and we don't focus on it, it increases the likelihood of these bad things happening. So Kudos to Elon Musk, but I also think that we are, we're have a long way away from that threat and we are and we will be enormous beneficiaries of these technologies. And that's why my, I don't want to sound like a broken record, but that's why I keep saying it's all about values. If I think we should take those threats very seriously and then say his are so abstract and we don't agree on them, it's true, but like, like Elon Musk, I mean they've set up this, this institute where to say well what are the dangers and then what are the things that we can do now? What are standards that we can integrate for example, into our computer programming. And so I mentioned my World Health Organization a committee. The question is well what are the, what are the standards that we can integrate into scientific culture that's not going to cure everything but it may increase the likelihood we'll have a better rather than worse outcome. But isn't there an inherent danger in other companies or other countries rather not complying with any standards that we serve? Because it would be anti competitive.

Speaker 1:          01:49:48       Yes. Like that would, that would, it would somehow or another diminished comp competition or diminish their competitive edge. It's true. And that's why, and that's the balance that we're, we're going to need to need to hold. It's, and it's really hard, but we have a window of opportunity now to try to get ahead of that. And like I said, we have chemical weapons, biological weapons, nuclear weapons where we've had international standards that have roughly held, I mean there was a time when slavery was the norm and there was a movement to say this is, this is wrong. And it was largely successful. So we have history of being more successful rather than, uh, than less. And I think that's the goal. But you're right. I mean, this is a race between the technology and the best values. Mine real concerned about artificial intelligence is that this paradigm shifting moment will happen before we recognize it's happening and then it'll be too late.

Speaker 1:          01:50:40       Yes, that's exactly right. And that's like I saying, that's, that's why I've written the book. That's why I'm out on the road so much talking to people. Why, why? It's such an honor for me to be in pleasure for me to be here with you talking about it cause we have to reach out and I to people when people can't be afraid of entering this conversation because it feels too technical or feels like it's somebody else's business. This is all of our business because this is all of our lives and it's all of our futures. So if in the future you think 20 years, the thing that's going to really change the most is predictive genetics and able be able to predict accurately a person's health. What do you help in life, health and love? What do you think is going to be the biggest detriment for all the stuff and the thing that we have to avoid the most?

Speaker 1:          01:51:24       Yeah, so one is, as I mentioned, this determinism just because if we just 10 of take our sense of wonder about what it means to be a human away, like that's really going to harm us. We talked about equity and access to these technologies and the technologies don't even need to be real in order to have a negative impact. So in India, there are no significant genetic differences between people in different castes, but the caste system has been maintained for thousands of years because people just have accepted these, uh, these differences. So this, it's a whole new way of, of understanding what is a human and it's really going to be complicated and we aren't ready for it. We weren't ready for it. Culturally, we aren't ready for it educationally. Certainly our political leaders aren't paying much of any attention to all of us who have a huge job. Oof. Oof. So when you sit down and you give this speech to Congress, yeah. What, what are you anticipating from them in terms of like what do you think that there's anything that they can do now to absolutely certain steps. Yes. So a few things. One is we need to have a national education campaign. I mean, this is so important. I would say it's on the future of genetics revolution and of AI because I think it's just, it's crazy

Speaker 3:          01:52:46       that we aren't focusing on these. Like I, I learned French in, in um, in grade school and high school and I'm happy to speak French, but I would rather have people say this is really important stuff. So that's, uh, that's number one. Number two is we need to make sure that we have a functioning regulatory system in this country and every country, and I do a lot of of comparative work and like the United Kingdom and they're really well organized. They have a national healthcare system which allows them at a national level to kind of think about longterm care and the tradeoffs in this country. Average person changes health plans every 18 months. And I was talking with somebody the other night and they were, they were working on a predictive health company and they said their first idea was they were going to sell this information to a health insurers because like, wouldn't this be great if you could?

Speaker 3:          01:53:40       Hell if you're a health insurer and you could, you had somebody who was your client and you could say, hey, here's some information. You can live healthier and you're not going to have this disease 20 years from now. And when he found out is the health insurers, they could have cared less because people were just, they were only going to be part of it for a year and a half. So we really need to think differently about how do we invest in people over the course of their lives. And certainly education is one, but thinking longterm about health and wellbeing is another. What do you think is going to be the first technological innovation in terms of like what, what's already on the pipeline right now that's going to radically alter human beings so radically? I think it's going to be the end of procreative sex. And so when we stop conceiving our babies through sex and we're selecting our embryos, that's going to open up this massive realm of possibility.

Speaker 3:          01:54:36       And certainly when we expand the number of fertilized eggs that were choosing from that, that is really, I think that's the kind of the killer application of genetics to the future of human life. Do you see that being attainable to the general population anytime in the near future? Like once it starts, once the technology gets established, it seems like it's going to be wealthier people that are going to have access to it first, right? Well it depends, probably yes. But when you think about right now we have all these people who are born with these terrible, in many cases, deadly genetic diseases and disorders. And what is this societal expenditure for lifetime care for all those people? I mean this is huge, huge amounts of money. So if we were to eliminate many of not the people, but eliminate, prevent those disease diseases and disorders from taking place in the first place, and we could use that money to provide, to provide, um, IVF and embryo screening to everybody using just the economic models now.

Speaker 3:          01:55:39       But then there's another issue that we have to talk about this. It's really sensitive. So I talk a lot about this. Um, but there are, and I talk in the book about people with Down Syndrome and I have a lot of friends who have kids with downs downstairs, but these Keller wonderful kids and they deserve every opportunity to thrive the same as as everybody else. And I'm really sensitive because people say, well, Hey, if you're, and I say like down syndrome is largely not going there. I'm going to be newborns with Down Syndrome 10 or 20 years from now. So we will say, well what are you saying about my kids? Like are you saying that if this is going to be eliminated that my kid has a less of a right to be as somebody else. And I always say absolutely not. And we need to be extremely sensitive that we're not dehumanizing people.

Speaker 3:          01:56:24       But if you have fifth, 10 or 15 fertilized eggs in a lab and you have to pick which one gets implanted in the mother and one of them will just has a disease like taste acts or sickle cell disease where they're going to die before they're 10 years old, would you choose affirmatively choose to implant that embryo versus the nine or 14 or whatever the number is of of other ones. And so these are really sensitive things and we can't be blahzay about them. Um, but we will have these choices and we're going to have to figure out how do we make them, well, I think there's also a real possibility of them being able to fix that. Yeah. And some things will be fixable and some things won't. And so that's, that's why though for these, for these single gene mutation, uh, disorders, now there's a debate.

Speaker 3:          01:57:13       I was speaking in Berkeley, uh, the other day. And so I was talking about these two options. One is embryo selection and one is, is gene editing. And so there were different people who got up, says, oh no, we can do embryo selection. That's the way and that we should, we should prevent these diseases. But gene editing that's going too far. That's, that's playing God. And so for different things, there'll be different options. Do you, when you, when you hear that, that that's going too far. W who's usually saying that there's two groups in one is certainly in the religious community were saying, well this is his plan gun. Um, but there's another kind of, it's like a progressive community who's, who are the kinds of people who were uncomfortable with genetically modified crops and people who are saying that once that the, that there's this slippery slope that once we start making what are called germline genetic modification.

Speaker 3:          01:58:05       So germline is that our, our sperm eggs and embryos, if you make a change to an adult human, it doesn't pass to their kids. If you make a change to a sperm and egg or an embryo, it will pass on. And so there are a lot of people who are saying, well, we don't understand the genetics well enough to make these changes that will last forever. I'm not in that, in that view. I just think that we need to be cautious. I may need to weigh the Ben the risks and the benefits of everything that we do. Do you think we do know enough about those changes in order? It depends because if we're, it depends on what we're selecting against. Like if the thing we're selecting against is some kind of terrible genetic disease that's going to somebody when they're a little kid, we have a lot of latitude because the alternative is death.

Speaker 3:          01:58:47       Right? And that's why I was so critical of this Chinese, um, biophysicist who created, who genetically engineered these two little girls born in China last year because he wasn't in the gene edits, they weren't probably weren't successful. It wasn't to eliminate some disease or disorder. He was trying to confer the benefit of a, of increased resistance to HIV. And so I think that we need to be very mindful and we need to be doing kind of a cost benefit analysis of the different things at different interventions. And there was an unintended side effect of this war, the believer, perceived potential, unintended side effect. And that's increased intelligence. It's a, it's a possibility. So how did this gene, so this gene is, it's called a CCR five is this gene. And when it was disrupted in some mouse studies, those mice became a little bit able to navigate mazes.

Speaker 3:          01:59:42       And so that was what led people to believe that this disruption of the CCR five could potentially lead to that kind of change in human. Nobody really knows. There's lots of things that happen in mice that don't have analogs in, in humans. And that was why it was so irresponsible is that this, this scientist in secret, um, made these, uh, these gene gene edits, he didn't get a proper consent from the parents. Um, yeah, yes. And enhanced China because it's China. Rod. Yeah. I mean, he can, they were, the parents were all manipulated and it's real. Yeah. And so that's the thing. So you're exactly right. Like we're humans, we're nuts as a species and so, and so we need to try to establish some kind of guide rails guard rails about what's okay, what we're comfortable with, what we're, what we're not. Now this guy is not operating in an isolated incidence.

Speaker 3:          02:00:33       There's gotta be a shit ton of that going on right now as we're talking, it's China. What do you think is happening over there? And I think it, China has a lot of money. They have brilliant people and they have a government that is hell bent on leading the world in advanced technology and thick. The scientific culture in China is just a very different than it is here. And so we know what we know, but we don't know what we don't know. And that's, it's a really, really big deal because China is in many ways a wild west and the technology exists to do some really big stuff. And that's, that's why we have to at least try to establish standards. Will we succeed? Fully know, but maybe we can do better than, than worse. Are you anticipating seeing like a lot of freaky things come out of China?

Speaker 3:          02:01:24       Yes. Whoa. You said that very quick. Yeah, no, it's true. I suppose I spend, I spend a lot of time in China I, and this, it's a different name, but the thing with China, China had this great ancient civilization, but they destroyed their own civilization in the great leap forward and the Cultural Revolution. They, they burned their books. They smashed their own and historic relics and so it's really, it's a society many ways that starting from scratch and so all of these norms that people get inherit through their traditions. China in many ways doesn't have and so and so it's, it's a very different, and China is growing. I mean they are increasingly powerful and China is going to be a major voice if forced, defining the world of the 21st century. That's why America has to get its act together. That's a hard concept for us to grasp.

Speaker 3:          02:02:14       When we think about the fact that they had the Great Wall, they have so much ancient art and architecture. We just assume they're a really old culture. They are, but they wiped it out. That's crazy. That's why if you want to see, if you want to see great Chinese art, you have to go to Taiwan. Because when the Chinese nationalists left in 1949 when they lost, as they were losing the civil war, they took the treasures and they put them in the National Museum of Taiwan in the cultural revolution, the great leap forward, kind of the red guards were just smashing all of their own stuff, their own ancient history. Now, now the Chinese Communist Party is saying, oh no, we're going back and we have this great 5,000 year old culture. And some ways it's true, but in some ways it's like an adolescent culture without these kinds of restrictions that other societies have got such a unique perspective that I haven't heard before.

Speaker 3:          02:03:07       And it makes so much sense in terms of like how frantic they are restructuring their world. Yeah. Yeah. And, and they feel that they got screwed over because there is this, this vague, the sense of Chinese greatness. When you hear the word middle kingdom, it's like China, the center of the world and everybody else, some kind of of tributary. And so their monumentally pissed off that these colonial powers came and overpowered them and they had to make all these concessions. They had to give land away and and hell bent on regaining weight gaining and are playing the long game. They are playing a long game and we have to be and we are not and we have to be mindful of it. That's also salty. You can do, if you have complete control of your population, you don't have to worry about people's opinions or you can just go in the direction that you feel is going to benefit the Chinese power, the power that be, wait, this is a country run by engineers.

Speaker 3:          02:03:55       We per country run largely by lawyers and and and reality TV people I guess. Yeah, but in China it's run by engineers. So there are all these problems and the answer is always engineering. So if you have a population problem, it's the answer is the one child policy environmental problem. You have Three Gorges Dam there. You don't have water in the north of China. You build this massive biggest water project in the world from south to north. You want to win in the Olympics, you engineer your population, you take kids away from their families and put them in their Olympic sports school. So I write about this in Genesis Code. If you're China and you kind of have this Plato's republic model of the world and work on to kind of identify the genetic or maybe manipulate these genetic superstars to be our greatest scientists and mathematicians and business leaders and political leaders like there a model that you can imagine for for how to do it. Wow. It makes you really nervous. It should, yes.

Speaker 3:          02:04:51       That's why like, I just feel like with this country, we don't have time to have all these distractions that we're focusing on junk. Like what it just like all of this, you, I'm on CNN all the time when I'm, when I'm home in New York and I always say like you guys, and I'm talking about kind of geopolitical issues, China and North Korea and when I always say it's like you guys recognize this is porn like CNN and Mspb. That's like one kind of porn and Fox and, and whoever else, info wars. That's another kind of porn, but it's all porn and we're just kind of, we're drawing people's attention to these few stories, but there's these big stories that we have to focus on. And, and certainly the rise of China is such an essential story for the 21st century because China is competing in all of these technologies.

Speaker 3:          02:05:41       And China, it's like go, go, go. I mean people in China who were involved in the tech world, when they go and visit silicon valley uniformly, they say, we cannot believe these people are so lazy. Like, why are they not working 24 hours a day? Why are they not issuing product new products every, uh, every week? And so this is, I mean, they are racing somewhere and it's going to have huge implications for the world. And so if we believe in our values as I believe we should, we have to fight for them in the place that we have to fight for him first is here and we can't, you know, it's just like every day that we're just focusing on this, this drama, this reality TV drama of our government is another day. We're not focusing on the big things. How are we going to get our act together?

Speaker 3:          02:06:26       How are we going to lead the world and technology? I mean another example is this is immigration. I think we have this whole fight or how do we keep people out? What I'd like to do is to go to to the State Department. I write every embassy in the world, you have a new job. You have to, we're going to give you whatever, a number 500 slots per year. You have to in your country find the 500 most brilliant, talented, creative, entrepreneurial people and say, we're giving you a green card. We're going to give you a little starter money. We want you to move to the United States and just start a life and have kids and if we we, we should be creaming the crop, skimming the cream over the rest of the world. I think we could take over, we, we could revitalize this country, but we're having this fight of how do we keep a small number of refugees out and it's just we're not focusing on the right things. That's a, that's again, another very, very interesting perspective. We are, we learned about Huawei in this country really. Not just, well, I learned about it because they put out some pretty innovative phones and interesting technology, but we learned it because the State Department was telling people to stop using their phones. Yep. Do you think that is trying

Speaker 2:          02:07:36       to stifle the competition? Like to try to look good cause the market share that they have, if they do really have number the number two selling cell phones in the world now that's not from America. Americans largely out of that conversation. Right. And if they were in America, they would probably dominate in America as well because they're cheaper. Yeah. And they're really good. Yeah. I mean they're, they, they're phones are insane. The cameras on their phones are off the charts. They put some video of the, the zoom capability of their newest phone and people were calling bullshit. There's like, there's no way that's not even possible. But it turns out it was true. They really can. It really can zoom. Yeah. Like a super expensive telephoto Lens. Yes.

Speaker 3:          02:08:18       Yeah. Yeah. So Huawei, it's a complicated stew. I for sure the founder of Walway is a former Chinese military officer for sure. Sure. In the early stages of their company, they stole straight out stole lots of source code from companies like Cisco. Um, for sure we should be really worried if Huawei is the sole supplier of the infrastructure that supports 5g all around the world because the Chinese government would have access to everything. And so that leads us to the question is one, is there a problem with Walway itself? Um, and, but then two is let's just say, and I inciting the answer to that first question is probably yes. Um, but then the question too is let's just say who all way is a legit company and they're not totally intimately connected to the Chinese government. Can we trust their relationship with the Chinese government?

Speaker 3:          02:09:16       And the Chinese government has a rule that every one of these companies has the big Chinese national companies, national champion companies, they have a communist party sell inside of that company. And so these, like, I think that we can't think of big Chinese companies just like we think of companies here. We have to think of them as quasi state actors. And that's why this, this fight that's happening right now is, is so important. And that's why like when China is out investing in different parts of the world, including Africa, their companies are kind of acting like arms of the government. They're making all kinds of investments that don't really make sense. If you just see, well this is a company doing something. If you say that this is a company with backing by the state that's fulfilling a function that supports the state, it's, it's just, it's a very different model. So I, I am actually quite concerned about, uh, about Huawei and I'm not a fan of everything that this administration is doing, but I think on, on China, it's important that we need to stand up. And I think pushing back on Walway is the right thing to do. I'm on to

Speaker 2:          02:10:20       about this for two reasons. One. I'm uncomfortable about that, about the Chinese government being inexorably connected to this global superpower in technology. But I'm also uncomfortable that it's sets a precedent for other nations follow. Yeah. Because

Speaker 1:          02:10:34       they're like, look as the only way to compete, because what you were talking about the investments that Walway or that the Chinese government makes in these other countries, and they don't seem to make sense if you're just dealing with a company, right. But if you're dealing with someone who's trying to take over the world, it makes a lot of sense. And so when we have our companies that you're out in someplace in Africa and you're competing with a Chinese company and to do something, build a port or whatever, and you're competing because you are an American company and so you have your cactus ideas, the poor, what's the income stream going to be about it? And you have a certain amount that you can bid because otherwise it becomes a bad investment. But if the Chinese company is that their calculus is not, is this a good or bad investment?

Speaker 1:          02:11:16       It's what is the state interest in controlling or quasi controlling this asset. And so that's why we can't project ourselves onto the Chinese. We can't say they're just like us. Just different. We have different models and our models are competing. Do you think that we should avoid while we products like consumer, should I, well I think the government should very tightly regulate products like a Walway products because some of their network routers or exactly, they've shown that they, they're using them to extract information. And so we've, we have a long history of European, Japanese, half Korean companies that have invested very well. They've out competed us and we've, we've allowed, we allowed the Japanese companies to outcompete our auto manufacturers. And that was, that was fine in the sense it are in the 1970s our cars had become shit because we had this monopoly. And so I'm all for open competition and I'm all for free trade.

Speaker 1:          02:12:16       It has to be fair. But I think that what China is doing, China recognized as a state that they could use the tools of capitalism to achieve state ends. And I think we need to be very cautious about that. That's interesting that you'd compare it to the automotive market because the consequences are so much different. Right. So much different cause, but we do have a model to go on. We could see what happened. We did, we made shitty cars. The Japanese took over and then we made better cars. Like I have a rental car here. I'm in Los Angeles. And I went to the, to the, um, the rental car place said at lax and they had all of the different cars and there was like a, a Nissan and Toyota and there was a Cadillac. And for the fact that, you know, I said I'm going to go with the caddy.

Speaker 1:          02:13:01       So it's a great car, I think are amazing. Incredible. American cars are very good now. They're great. And then so like I'm all for competition, but I just feel like what Chinese, some Chinese companies are doing, it's not competition. It's, they have become, not all of them, but quasi state actors. And if that's what they're doing, I think we need to respond to them in that way. Interesting. Um, what else should we be concerned with, which will be concerned with anything that North Korea is doing? Oh, absolutely. So I, I have, um, spent a lot of time

Speaker 3:          02:13:32       in North Korea. That's why I brought it up. Yeah. So I've, um, I advised the North Korea, North Korean government and the establishment of, of special economic zones, which I certainly believe if North Korea could have economic growth and integrate into the rest of the world, that would be great. And so I've, I, um, when you went all this was in 2015 now, but I've been there twice. Um, cross the border from China and zigzag the country by land, visited 10 or 12 different sites. So spent almost two weeks by Lance. I've really incredible. I mean, North Korea, um, one, it's the most organized place I've ever seen. I mean, there's not anywhere, there's like on the side of the road, the, the stones are all raked. There's not a stick. Every little line is drawn. It's like total control. There were very, in the, in the agricultural areas, there were very few machines and very few farm animals.

Speaker 3:          02:14:24       So I saw people pulling plows like you know, usually have the animal in front of the plow and the person behind here, there were like two people in front of the plow and one person behind the people where the, the uh, the animals and we would go and visit these. They just, cause they didn't, they, a lot of the animals got eaten when they had their famine. And so we visited these different sites for the special economic zones and they would say like what they had done and what they were thinking about doing. And I would say like, how do you, do you know anything about the market? Like do you, what are you going to sell here? And they said, well we know about clearing land and building a fence. And then we, we went to Pyongyang and I spoke to about 400 economic planners and I said, look, I know you have these plans that to the special economic zones, it's totally going to fail the way it's going to work.

Speaker 3:          02:15:12       You have to connect to the market economy. You have to empower your workers, you need information flow. How else are you going to learn and adapt? So North Korea, it's a really dangerous place and now it's even more dangerous because, um, president Trump threw it was this kind of nonsensical hail Mary in these, these meetings with Kim Jong Un, there was no, never any indication that the North Koreans were planning on giving up their nuclear weapons. They never said they would. It's the last thing they would do it because their goal is survival. And so there was this kind of head fake, which was like a PR stunt to be able to say, art, we're having these, these meetings. And of course the North Koreans weren't ever going to give up their nuclear weapons there. They're still not. So now things are ramping up. So North Korea in the last couple of days has started firing missiles again at the United States today and see us military seized a North Korean ship.

Speaker 3:          02:16:07       So we're going back to this very dangerous place. And, and so I think we really need to do a much better job. We need much more concerned. North Korea is, it's really hard and these guys are really smart. I mean, I, they are, they are very, people say, well, these guys are poor. They must not be, I'm into like mad, like we're playing cards with them. We've got the whole deck. They don't have any one card and yet they're there. They're in the game. They're holding us to a, to a stalemate and it's really worrying. And why did you go over there? Like what, what, what were you thinking? So I thought a lot about it because I have a background in human rights. I was a human rights officer for the United Nations in Cambodia. I'm the child of a refugee. I have this very strong belief in human rights and that in supporting people in North Korea, they have about 120,000 people in the most brutal, brutal, horrific prison camps.

Speaker 3:          02:17:08       And so when I was asked to be part of this six person delegation, advising them on the special, on the establishment of special economic zones, one instinct was screw them. I don't want to be part of this at all. But I also felt that if North Korea could have some kind of integrated economic development that would at least connect them to the world, that would create some kind of leverage and that would, uh, that would help, uh, help people. So I decided, uh, to go, um, and I'm glad that I, that I did, but at this is, these are really hard artichokes people. And, and it's very unfortunate that in, in president Trump's negotiations with the North Koreans, human rights was never once mentioned. And I think that that's like, as coming back to values, like we have to be clear about who we are and what we stand for and be consistent in fighting for him.

Speaker 3:          02:17:58       Do you think that Trump didn't bring that up because he wanted to be able to effectively communicate with them and not put them on their heels? Maybe. Um, but I feel like has, had they done, I mean, I think that if he thought that there was a real chance of progress, but the hard thing was he didn't know much about the North Koreans. He has people and we have brilliant people working in the United States government and all of those people, all of the US intelligence agencies were telling president Trump that the North Koreans have absolutely no intention of giving up their nuclear weapons. And so maybe he did think that he would charm Kim Jong on, or he would say, hey, we're gonna give you economic development or, or whatever. But I think for most people who were observers of, of Korea washed it for, I thought that was not, uh, so we, we gave away a lot.

Speaker 3:          02:18:48       So we didn't mention human rights. We suspended our military exercises. We gave them the legitimacy of a presidential meeting, which they'd been wanting for 30 years, and we didn't get anything back. So it had we gotten something back then you could say, well, that was a risk for taking maybe. Mm. No, I haven't heard it described that way, but I'm agreeing with what you're saying. What do you think he could have done differently though? I don't think the meeting should have happened with, no, nope. No conditions. There were no police. So if he had said, I'm open to meet with the North Koreans, which is something the North Koreans have always wanted, we could have met with the North Koreans anytime immediately for the last 30 years, but in order to do it they need to do this, this and this. And if they do it we'll meet like that would have been a legitimate thing.

Speaker 3:          02:19:35       But what he said is somebody, the the the North Korean, I'm inside the, the South Korean national security visors peeked into his office and he, and he goes, hey, they wanted me to, and it was like, sure, that seems like an interesting thing to do. And I think that with this diplomacy you kind of have to get something. And so we gave away so much upfront and the North Koreans weren't, didn't have it an incentive to do anything in return was his perspective that it would be better to be in communication and to be friends with this guy. Who was that? What was that? What he was thinking like B. But we have real interests in the sense that we have large military forces in Seoul. We have a lot at stake. We have our closest ally, Japan who has had citizens abducted. And so I think that was what he thought is like, let's be friendly.

Speaker 3:          02:20:20       And then with the f the force of personal chemistry, um, everything will, will unlock. But I think that was always extremely unlikely. What do you think is going to happen with our country? I think eventually, and I've written this, I think eventually this regime will, will collapse under its own weight, but it's really held out a long time because you think of the collapse of the Soviet Union, they had enough Soviet Union. It had enough bullets to survive. If they had said, you know, we're just going to shoot everybody at the Berlin Wall and every dissenter, they would still be, the North Korea has essentially murdered millions of people. So with famine and execution and, and, and, and prison camps. So I think they're going to stay for a while, but eventually, um, there will be leaders in North Korea who will come to the conclusion that it's safer to oppose the Kim family than to wait for the Kim family to come.

Speaker 3:          02:21:13       And get you in that true tends to happen in these kind of totalitarian systems where there's so little trust. There's so little loyalty. Jesus. Yeah. What is there, what other conditions like technologically, like what was their infrastructure log? So the general infrastructure is absolutely terrible. I mean, they have roads in the big cities that are actually quite nice roads because there's no cars. And so, um, but their infrastructure is, is terrible. I mean, all of their, their power supply, they have brownouts blackouts, uh, all the time at their manufacturing is all being decimated. So it's terrible. But they have really focused their energy on building these nuclear weapons because they think that these nuclear weapons give them leverage to do things and to extract concessions and to get, uh, to get a bid. It's terrible infrastructure. So do, they don't have an internet, right? But they have something similar, but it only allows them access to a few state run websites.

Speaker 3:          02:22:13       Well, average person doesn't have access to the inner. So the way it works is it's all about loyalty. So you need three or so generations of loyalty to the Kim family to even set foot in Pyongyang, the capital. So really? Yes. So it's not like you can kind of move around or whatever. It's like just to be in the capital, like you have to have your loyalty proven and so average person out in the country, they don't have access to much a of anything. They have a little bit more now than they did in the past. And then for this relatively small number of elites who are in largely in Pyongyang and in the other cities which are like there, there's a ring of defense around these cities and just to, to enter, you have to have all of these checks. Some of them have access to limited internet.

Speaker 3:          02:23:00       Um, but it's, it's, it's tightly controlled and it's not like you're kind of going on Google and look going wherever you want. And they probably would get in trouble if the Gould the wrong thing. Yes. And trouble. It's not just you trouble like if you Chubb, if, if my brother or my uncle does something that gets me in trouble with the regime, the whole extended family is out. And that means you either you go to prison camps or you're kicked out of Pyongyang. I mean at this it's all about collective punish and people are terrified. And by that ruthless punishment structure that they've set up, that's how they've kept control of the country. And everybody's forced to rat on each other, right? Yeah, absolutely. Yeah. Yeah. They're, they're, they're actually the compelled to tell on each other for one thing that you did. If you don't, then what if you don't, then you are complicit because they, yes.

Speaker 3:          02:23:50       So that's, and that's, they're these horrible stories. I've met a lot of these, uh, of these people who were in the prison camps. Like I have a, a friend of mine, I mean, she was this 13 year old girl and her father, um, was a, like a low level North Korean official. And then he was accused of something. And so this family that was privileged all of a sudden was, was out and just just these horrible things in prison and rape and this little, I mean, now she's in the United States and incredibly positive and it's amazing how resilient she is. But this is like a real hell and it's a real, it's an issue. And I think that for us as Americans, as humans, we're less human when there are people who are suffering like this. Yeah, I agree. Now, um, you were traveling all over North Korea.

Speaker 3:          02:24:38       What were they having you do while you were, so we would do is we would go from one of these special economic zones to the other. And in each one it was kind of the same story. You'd get there, there'd be like a big field. The farmers had been kicked off, there was a fence around it. And then the group of, of the local officials would come and they'd have like a big chart and they have a plan. Like, here's where we're going to build this building and here's [inaudible]. And I always ask the same question like what are you going to do here? Why do you think you're going to be competitive? How do you know what the market prices are? How are your workers going to be empowered so they can change things? I mean, he, in the old days, it used to be you just kind of have these automaton workers.

Speaker 3:          02:25:17       Now workers are actually making big decisions and fixing things and they didn't have an answer to any of those questions. And that's what happens when you have these totalitarian top down systems is that like if, if you, being creative is actually really dangerous. So if somebody says do x, you just do X. Wow. Yeah, no, it's, it's really incredible and it's, it's so sad because I spend a lot of time in South Korea and this is the most dynamic place. There's like I often I go to soul just to see what technology is going to show up here a few years in the future. I mean it's, it Seoul is like the future and then just 35 miles from soul is the demilitarized zone. And the other side it's, it's incredible. And the real problem would be once they finally did get free of that community or the of that, that mean you can call him whenever you want.

Speaker 3:          02:26:11       The dictator and that him and his family, what would they, what tools would they have? Like how prepared would they be to be autonomy? Well it's really the good thing, the benefit that they have if there is, so here's my thought of what a scenario the scenario might look like. And I think eventually probably there'll be some kind of coup attempt against the Kim Fam. Let's just say it succeeds. But that would probably result in another military dictatorship with another group. Well we don't know cause then I think immediately I think the Chinese would invade. Really? Yeah. Cause people think of the curb. When people think of the Korean War from the early 1950s they think, oh it's the crane where it must've been the Americans fighting against the Koreans. But the Korean War, the two sides, where is America and the South Koreans fighting against the North Koreans and the Chinese, the Chinese did the most of the, uh, of the, uh, of the fighting.

Speaker 3:          02:27:05       And so China and North Korea is the only country in the world that has a treaty alliance now with China, kind of like we have with Japan and with, and with South Korea. And so China, their biggest fear is having a reunified Korean peninsula, al allied to the United States. So I think if there was a coup, the Chinese would immediately move in militarily. Then immediately there would be this call to have some kind of UN body. Um, and there would be a call for a UN authority. And then I think it would be agreed that the Chinese would stay and they just would put on blue helmets, like as a, as a UN force. And then we'd have to negotiate what happens next. And I think what the Chinese would do would be say, well, we'll leave when the Americans leave, is that, I think that would be what will likely happen. But eventually I think we're going to see a Korean reunification. And the good news of these reunified countries like eastern West Germany is, there's a whole system of law that he's just, he's just, North Korea will be swallowed into South Korea. And then you have law, you have an infrastructure and it, it'll take, you know, one or two generations, but I think that will eventually happen and I'm hoping it can happen without nuclear war. Terrible. A terrible bloodshed. But it's that it's going to be a big challenge. God Damn. Yeah. That insurmountable.

Speaker 2:          02:28:22       Yeah. Just hearing you talk about that. What about North Korea getting absorbed by South Korea? I'm like, oh my God, good luck. Just, yeah, imagine. Just imagine the whole thing. Yeah. Well listen man, it's been a fascinating conversation. I really appreciate it everybody. I really appreciate you coming here and um, you've certainly sparked a lot of interesting ideas in my head and I'm sure a lot of other people's heads as well. And I would like to see a down the line, where are the salt goes? And I hope it don't get swallowed up by machines. We won't, but it's up to us to fight for what we believe in. Well, thank you very much, man. Really appreciate it. It was a lot of fine. Bye everybody.

Speaker 4:          02:29:00       Okay.

Speaker 5:          02:29:06       Okay.

Speaker 2:          02:29:06       Hmm

Speaker 5:          02:29:08       hmm.
