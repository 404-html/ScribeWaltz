Speaker 1:          00:01          Hello Freak bitches.

Speaker 2:          00:03          It is what it was. Just like any other problem that people go back to. I mean at some point it's up to you to release yourself from that obligation to get upset or feel bad about something that didn't go right in the past, you know? And uh,

Speaker 1:          00:19          that's a huge point because people define themselves by the past instead of thinking about who they are now instead of they still look back at a mistake they made and don't just get past that mistake, grow and learn, but dwell on it. I think it defines them.

Speaker 2:          00:32          That's the worst thing I met some guys in band, he says is a singers. I've only met him twice, two different times, a years later. Both Times. He started telling me about the story, about what happened to him when he was in this. Anything in this poor guy is gone on all these years and he's still focused on the worst situation that he ever had to live through.

Speaker 1:          00:52          Yeah. And it's so a attached to it. Well some guys get one break up and they're done. Some guys, one breakup in their twenties will tank them for a decade. I've met guys like that that, yeah. You know, I came out here with Sally and you know, she fucking fell in love with their trainer and dude, Sally still on. What is that in fucking years ago. Oh, well, you know, changed my life bro. But totally, totally. I was so disappointed I can't trust women anymore. Oh, you stupid. Fuck. You know what? What if he got mugged by one person who'd done trust in people? One person was a murderer. Let's not trust anybody. Yeah, yeah. I heard about Ted Bundy. I'm not trusting people anymore. Oh, okay, great. I'm not sleeping tonight. We, yeah, I mean there's definitely pitfalls in life. You're going to run into him. We all are. And you can learn and grow. If you survive it, pick yourself up yet,

Speaker 2:          01:41          dust the dust off and then you start going and I don't let this stuff, uh,

Speaker 1:          01:46          well let it beat you down. It's also directly proportionate to the amount of hardships that people face in life. Their ability to face hardships. You know, and there's a lot of folks that live life on a cushy cloud of marshmallows and bullshit and then one day something goes wrong and I mean that's why spoiled kids are so sad. Like a spoiled young boy is one of the saddest things ever. A young boy that becomes a man and can't take care of himself and his dad has to keep on rescuing him. His Dad has to keep on bailing them out of situations and giving them money. I've met guys like that and that is a crippling affliction when they don't have the character themselves to be able to get by in life. They constantly need someone to help them and bailed them out. Even as a grown man, I've met guys in their forties it's still need help from their parents.

Speaker 1:          02:29          I'm like, what the fuck, man, you're never going to get it right because somewhere along the line they didn't face enough of the university to realize that there's sometimes we just got to get up and get shit done. There's sometimes we have to fucking pull yourself up and you have to push forward. Even if you want to stay in the bed, and if you don't do that and you just keep calling on your daddy and your daddy keeps rescuing you, you never developed those tools, you never developed that ability to recognize what you're doing wrong with your life. What's your age limit? You would cut a check off at a think I think around 55 whoa. You're a generous man. I mean it all depends. It all depends on if she goes to yoga. There's a, there's some good looking 55 out there are now.

How old's Christie Brinkley know she's up there. She's hot as fuck. He Seen Helen Hunt lately. No, I don't need to do that. There's this movie called, he's trying to kill my boner. Frank Lucas bringing up Helen Hunt. You're going the wrong way, but you got to hear this picture of Christy blanket to cleanse my palette. There's this, let's take this conversation slow. This is getting exciting. There was this movie called, uh, the session and if you just look up the preview of it, it's a about this guy that has an iron lung and he's, you know, he's very like Stephen Hawking and then maybe just laying there, Greg Hall and stuff. And so Helen Hunt's like his therapist or something and he goes, she's like, oh, you need to get laid.
