Speaker 1:          00:00:04       One of the few things I get nervous about, not nervous, but like, oh, what do I do here? The start of every podcast. It's like, all right, once we get off to the races, we're all good. Turn off your volume. I think that would be the second thing that you think. Have you said it and right when you said it, the volume came on. I'm pathetic. It's not even funny anymore. It's just sadness. This podcast brought to you by hover. If you go to hover.com forward slash rogen, you can get 10 percent off your domain name registrations plus a lot of stuff.

Speaker 2:          00:01:39       Look at this. I looked@Dunkinlovesbabies.com which is available and Duncan does love babies. I love those little sweetie. But then like it gives you, like the other available domains that you can buy through hover and it just goes from Dunkins loves babies.net to Chicago babies. But Chicago babies is $488. Just don't try it. Don't connect the dots here. Let's just move on. Do you have a baby in Chicago? Yeah, I forget it. Just move on.

Speaker 1:          00:02:02       Dr [inaudible] been having babies. What? I love him,

Speaker 2:          00:02:07       just because you love them doesn't mean you have to have them.

Speaker 1:          00:02:11       That's it. Go to a go to hover.com. Forward Slash Joe. As I said, is that what it said is that you want, I said what was the exact wording of it? Hover.com. Forward Slash rogen. Sorry. And you get 10 percent off your domain name registration. So that's hover.com forward slash rogen. Uh, we are also brought to you by [inaudible] dot com. That's an n I t a done this commercial fucking billion times. Um, this, uh, what an honor it is, a company that sells supplements to increase your performance, whether it's cognitively, whether it's physically. There's a shroom tech sport, which is an amazing, amazing supplement that we put together. It's from the quarter seps mushroom and the idea behind it is there certain plants like cordyceps, mushroom being an excellent law, but it's not really a plant because cordyceps mushroom is a crazy kind of fungus. It's like a weird sort of a living thing.

Speaker 1:          00:03:10       It's closer to funguses or I believe I don't want to speak out of school, but I believe they're closer to humans and plants is right. True. Yeah. Well, this quarter, eps mushroom stuff, uh, the, uh, the first experimented it apparently when in high altitude hurting communities, they found that the cows are more active after the ate these mushrooms and so they kind of put it together and the way it's grown, it's grown like on caterpillars or some shit. It's like this really freaky fucking process to create. But what it is, is a, it's an amazing endurance supplement. It's a fantastic stuff. It's like really obvious effect if you have like a brutal workout, if you're going to go a do a spin class Duncan and get ferocious to some eighties music, you know, some fucking Pat Benatar and you're like, yeah, right. Um, it's just an excellent supplement for, um, for endurance.

Speaker 1:          00:04:07       Anybody's doing Jujitsu. If you're doing kettlebells, anything along those lines. It's got a lot of [inaudible] in it as well. Real noticeable effect. Um, Alpha brain is, uh, another supplement that we have that, uh, I swear by it, I've been taking this shit forever, but I've been taking nootropics forever too. I just think it only makes sense to me that if it's possible, as long as I'm not starving as long as I have money to buy supplements and if you don't spend your money on healthy food, but if you have the money, I would always think that what, what, what is like really important? Speed, speed. What is really important when one of the things that's really important to me is the way my brain functions, you know, because I know it's variable. I know there's a big difference between the way I am when I'm hung over.

Speaker 1:          00:04:53       There's a big difference between the way I am when I'm jet lagged and when I'm in the groove, when I feel great and my words are flowing and conversations are going smoothly and you're in the middle of. I don't know what the fuck causes that. Okay. I think it's a bunch of things. I think it's rest, but I also think it's health and I also think it's nutrition. And my experience with, uh, started off with Bill Roman [inaudible] stuff. It's called neuro one and he created that because he, he got a bunch of concussions from playing football, famous football player and um, you know, he was fighting against it and one of the things he did is try to improve the quality of his brain and improve the quality of the functioning of his mind. So he started experimenting with various nutrients that do that and uh, and that's sorta where Alpha brain took it.

Speaker 1:          00:05:37       From there we just tried to put together the best combination of what we know so far about these things. And if you're not interested in it, that's cool. I understand. If you are interested in it, you can go and use the coordinate Rogan. You can save 10 percent of any of the supplements. This is all fairly controversial stuff with some people and that's one of the reasons why on it has a money back guarantee. One hundred percent the first order of 30 pills within the first 90 days you have 100 percent money back guarantee. You don't even have to return the product to stay. The sucks. Give me my money back. Its because no one's trying to rip you off, but just trying to sell you the best shit. It's not a massive difference. It's a subtle difference, but I believe it's a real difference, I think. I think it improves, it improves the quality of my thinking. It sounds crazy, but if you, if you just google nootropic and o, o t r o, p, I see you will see, uh, all the different studies and tests that had been done on it and it's shown increases in memory and it's really fascinating stuff. Um, and very controversial as I sent. So it's a fake, but that's a real, that's a fake really? Oh yeah, that's real. Wow. Yeah, she's in shape. She's,

Speaker 3:          00:06:49       she's on it. Oh forgive me.

Speaker 1:          00:06:54       You know, I've talked about this, uh, this supplement company so many times with so many podcasts that almost seems ridiculous, but that's just something I believe in. I believe in the ethics of the company. I believe in the message. I believe in trying to give people shit that makes your body work better. I'm huge on that. I think it's super important. So I'm psyched to be working with them. And again, used code name Rogan save 10 percent of any of the supplement.

Speaker 3:          00:07:18       Is this Dr Lazar. Who's this guy? I don't know.

Speaker 1:          00:07:22       That's interesting. That's A. Oh, that's heath haring. Oh really? Yeah. He is a former UFC fighter, former pride fighter legend MMA legend. I think he's a pro poker player now. Crazy, crazy dude. Wild Man.

Speaker 3:          00:07:34       Look, there's an asteroid so it doesn't matter because everyone's going to die from this aspect. I think on it. It's just saying listen to the hill pitch. I don't know what the dream. That's dope. That's an Alpha brain induced serious. Fuck. Yeah, it doesn't make sense. Well look, it's the whole company is like, it's very cool. It's a very cool company and you know, one of the cool things about it is

Speaker 1:          00:07:57       they're like, Aubrey is a young dude. He's a very enthusiastic guy and occasionally they would

Speaker 3:          00:08:04       do things that are like just a little bit silly, you know, but it's not bad intentions, you know, he's, he's just all about going after it and getting it. Um, when you talk about going after it and get it, getting it though, there's, there's a certain douchey genus that just sort of like comes off when you talk about like, you know, uh, anything that pumps up your masculinity, you know, anything that like makes you more a vibrant as a man. It's like border line, really Douchey, you know, and one of the things that was in my message board picked up was it said in the, uh, this new supplement t plus at testosterone, but it says something about it increasing your swagger.

Speaker 3:          00:08:53       I saw it, first of all, I it and I went, no. I was just like, no, please. They didn't really write swagger, but it was just for a lot of young dudes. That's a cool thing to say. Like, yeah, you know, it's just my fucking swagger. Everything. I mean, are you being honest? What is swagger? Isn't that important? It's important to have like a sense of invigoration. It just such a Douchey word unfortunately is it's not bad to have a swagger. It's definitely bad to use the word. Yeah. If it's a like a genuine name, that should not be said. Do you know what I mean? What is that? When you feel great when your. When your life is fucking rolling around, perfect sound, the perfect frequency and you have that feeling like you just walk up like is that that it's not swagger. Okay.

Speaker 3:          00:09:43       Let's. It is kind of a swagger but swaggers too gross or word, so we have to have another word for it. What is that feeling? That feeling like when you're at your past like, wow, I'm about as happy as I think I've ever been a being in the zone, but what is that harm? Whatever. Whatever it is. You can't call it swagger now and the audit it so thank you. Rogan board know that the people that makes axe body spray probably have a good answer with that question. I don't think they would even be perplexed the other. The other thing that the rather rugged boy put out was the t plus supplement has an ad where it's a dude super power lifter guy. He's like one of the world champion power lifter guy. He was a huge, enormous guy and I'm the end of the ad was him at a bar with two different girls and they're like, this guy look at, he's stretching, kissing, kissing.

Speaker 3:          00:10:42       No, he did not go back and look at this video. Every time we an arm, he's stretching. What is this thing? You guys don't understand what you're talking about? He's about to lift $8,000. Fucking million pounds. Some guys enormous. But the commercial is, uh, you know, I mean, the dude's legit power lifter. The idea is that supplement to increase your body's production of testosterone, but at the end of it, it was a little hotties at a bar and it was like no grinding cocaine for brain powder on it. That's an enormous person. That swag. Do you think he's got swag? What'd you just say? Would you not even tell you? That's why we just say swag? No, I'd run from that date. Honestly. If I saw that. Cue The music man. Usually code named Brogan and go fuck yourself Joe Rogan. We love you. Powerful dog. So your back man. I'm back back. Back from the precipice. Back from the precipice, well none of us are ever like from the precedence, but I saw a big sign today. It was something about surviving cancer and the lady was a smile and laugh and then she was like holding a baby or something like that and it says something about surviving cancer, and I thought about it. I was like, we don't really survive shit. Do it. Nope.

Speaker 4:          00:12:18       There's no surviving. Yeah. Something we do for a little. We put it off for the amount of time that you're. You're sentient. You extended the amount of time that you have consciousness. It's a very funny thing. It's like our age starts. The moment that matter were composed of wakes up to an awareness of itself and stops the moment. It's not aware of itself anymore, but what we are. That's not really our age. It's much longer than that and surviving means you've extended the amount of self awareness by some number of years, but it doesn't really surviving. Don't. This is something I've been entirely on stage. The whole surviving cancer thing is a. it's an annoying term to like now I'm a cancer survivor. That's what I am now. I don't want to be that. That's it's so many other things I'd like to be represented by then. Then that, that's not there. Anyone out there who's fighting cancer right now, by the way, keep up the good fight. There's a whole brotherhood that you find out there if people and and sisterhood of people who are dealing with this shit and it's beautiful. So I don't mean to denigrate your struggle that you're going through. It's just, I wish there was another word for it. And then then, then, then survivor such a dire term. It's such a dire term. It's like you just climbed out of a dragon's mouth. There's are smoldering car. I think

Speaker 3:          00:13:34       there's a real problem whenever you label anything, call people, uh, you know, a cancer victim, a cancer survivor, a cancer, a success in the war on cancer, you know, whatever, whenever you, you, you, you automatically categorize it, falls into this sort of package.

Speaker 4:          00:13:53       They want to classify everything man. And even not just fucking, you know, the, the, by the way, can't find. I'm a cancer survivor. I had and I don't that. It's not a term I I care for, but fine, but what's weird is when people really that's becomes their new identity, like what they were before, they didn't die from a disease or a thing becomes insignificant to this one little moment of overcoming something. And I think that's where it's weird to me. It's like, well, no, you're the sum total of everything you've done, not just some inevitable Blewett that emerged that you climbed out of or temporarily managed to, uh, stop. Why are you wearing a pink ribbon? Then? How do you know? How do you know what's tied around my cock cock ring?

Speaker 3:          00:14:41       Who's the first sick fuck that figured out a cock ring? I got to figure out how to get more blood in my dick. Hm? How do I do this? Let me just come down. It might be a good idea. I've done the finger cock rang though when you're like a little too drunk and he can't quite get it. Hard to like squeeze the base of it to keep us on track. I didn't know that. How do you know Jesus? You don't know. But yeah, you never know. So one of my bits, oh way back in the day and I'm like, you have to or something like that. Clamping the base of your cock. I forget if it was a. yeah, it was like he was A. Hugh Hefner had said in this magazine, like they were asking him like, hey you date like these 20 year old girls, what did they feel? How do they feel about dating you? And he said, well they feel very lucky. This has always been a dream for them. And then, you know, I had this whole lucky, lucky living in a dream, squeezed the base of it. This guy's got a semi going lucky girl, sweet quota, Cock. Lucky the squeeze, the base of it to keep it semi going as old as time. So some dude figured out how to deal with like a rope

Speaker 2:          00:15:58       girl that hangs out at the comedy store. And her mom was a famous playboy, a person that dated Hugh hefner. And, and she was saying that one time she had those balls inside of her, the banging balls or whatever they're calling it. And then he went down on her and one came out and choked him and he, he, uh, she had to save his life.

Speaker 3:          00:16:20       Oh my God. You fucking freaks. That's the universe trying to kill you. He fucking balls that shoot chick snatch giant lead shot. That's a funny way to dive. Yeah. What is that about? The carry the weights in your pussy. So it makes you like clamp down and that that's what keeps your pussy tightens up the move.

Speaker 2:          00:16:41       Yeah. It's like you're constantly tightening your pussy up to you. They control these balls that are inside of you when you walk. So it's kind of like a, we fit for your vagina.

Speaker 3:          00:16:49       That's fucking bananas. How crazy is that? Chicks had been lifting weights with their pussies. It works too. Yeah. There was a woman in Russia, I think it was a Russian woman who could stick something in her pussy, like, and clamp it down and like pick up weight, like, like actually like a jaw. It would clamp down on this shoot, stick like a ball on a rope and they're posting and then clamp down and lift weights.

Speaker 2:          00:17:14       That's crazy. Have you seen these anal trainer tales? They're like, what? Girls who'd like anal? They keep them inside of them and they have like a tail, like a hair tail

Speaker 3:          00:17:26       and chick who can lift weights with their pussies has got a be just an unstoppable freak. Like there's no way you're going to satisfy her. She's lifting weights with her pussy. She is like all. She's all about milking cock. That's all she is all about. That's her number one thing online that says she's so good at it. She can't wait to get a cock in there to shock the guy. It's probably, and it probably mostly new Cox. You know these guys like. And then what's the big. Oh Shit. It's like a fucking grabbing a hold of her. I mean she could pick up weights with her pussy. It's probably way stronger than her hand because she's developed it and like some crazy way. It's hilarious the way people spend time on this planet. It's amazing that some people are just like, I'm gonna. Make my pussy strong in this incarnation.

Speaker 3:          00:18:12       Well, but doing it with. What is it? What if it was amazing though? What if it made a huge difference? Oh, I don't think there's like, you know, like grossly key. I'm not saying there's better worse. I'm just saying it's a funny thing like if you came out of a spaceship on some alien planet and you're like, all right, while I'm on this planet, I'm going to make it so my badge final muscles are fucking strong. Well, if you enjoy sex though, you enjoy pleasure. Can we tell them it is possible that you can make the, the vaginal muscles strong? You can then. But why wouldn't you do that? I would do that if I was a chick. Why wouldn't you want to a Super Pussy Dick Pills? You do those, you know, we all deal with it. I am not leveling judgment on these wonderful women who are making their vaginas strong and I encourage it. I think you should do it if you're drawn towards that. I just think it's a curious thing. The way people spend their time. That's certainly of the ways people spend their time. That is a fascinating way. It's also fascinating the idea of like, um, like a Viagra or something along those lines, like a pill that makes your dick hard. And what if, what if there was a wooded flood was like exercise you could do that could make your dick bigger and harder.

Speaker 3:          00:19:27       You like you could grow your dick the way a dude grows his chest muscles. You know, just steady workout gyms would be disgusting. Did you see the video I posted about the Indian guy that wraps his cock up in a stick and stretches it out? Oh, it's on my twitter. Find that on my twitter and pull it up. I think we can even show it on new stream because you don't really see it sort of. He's sort of tucked away. It's a very strange. Please use stream. Don't take us down please. Youtube. Don't take us down. Oh yeah. Ustream won't let you show this. This, this, this. This is amazing what we got. Yeah. If there's nudity in it, we can't show it. Show it. Show it. It's, it's like tribal nudity. Sunday Bible nudity. That's like National Geographic News. We can do it in. What will happen? I don't even want to say what he was doing when I was in jail. Let me turn off my twice. Okay. Hold on.

Speaker 3:          00:20:24       It happened to me already a few times. Why don't you just describe it in a very picture, esquire. Hmm. I just had it happened. Damn. Is there a way you can stick a little bouncing ball over his cock and balls? Maybe take a look at this page. Take a look. Yeah. Okay. Just go to my twitter page, but if I tweet it, I'm a chatty bitch. I tweeted it up. You're going to lose a lot. I mean if you do like the Dick Pills and use the Zma like I've been doing, I do not do those. Create. If I was going to do a pill, I would get the real chemical. I think you're, you're, you're taking a crazy gamble. What these fucking 7:11 store. I know. I'm revealing. Um, I've gotten to the point where like I realized 7:11 takes the safe route. Like their products are little bit weaker and not say, but you go to some of these like miscellaneous gas stations that they don't give a shit.

Speaker 3:          00:21:13       There's these things called like ml two, like good for two weeks and you're like, how is that even possible? And then take it and like, I'm like, I'm cover. It's just like a skull in a boob or something. The way they're getting away with it, as Aubrey told us was that they're taking, they're taking, they're taking giant amounts of generic cialis and generic Viagra and those chemicals are not that expensive and you can get those chemicals and if you sell it in like little single serving forms at a gas station, it's actually profitable. So these crazy flux, they're just selling Viagara. It's, I mean it's Cialis, Viagra. I should go grab the one that's in my car and just show you how ridiculous is that? You also should really listen to what Tim Ferriss said. Oh, I know Tim Ferriss, who's a brilliant guy, has a great quote.

Speaker 3:          00:22:02       And the quote is he doesn't believe that there is a biological free lunch. He's like, anything that's doing hasn't has that positive and impact in one direction will have most likely and equal equally positive reaction in another direction. It's very possible that it could cause real issues. You're talking about something super potent. Yeah. Isn't that weird? Why is that? That's a fascinating thing. That one thing. There's always a weird trade off, but I mean, what could it be that your Dick doesn't work without that stuff? Is that possible? I think with Dick Pills, it's better to burn out than to fade away.

Speaker 3:          00:22:49       Did you just went deaf? Leopard Leppard us. That's right. That's hilarious. Yeah. Well you might have a good point. It depends on, you know, would you rather have. I don't do it every 10 years of life left with boners or 30 years of life with basically start you start off with three quarter Chubby this year. I only do it half a Chubby next year, but you'll know it shuts off and within five or six years and then basically the rest of your life you just, you know, walk around. I only do it when I go to strip clubs for the most part, unless I know that there's a guaranteed good lineup of sex that night. Oh yeah. Well, as long as you're not abusing it, Brian. Yeah. I just don't know if that stuff's safe. I mean, what is a. I don't know. What's the studies on, on taking that, Brian, those boner pills, those things are magic.

Speaker 5:          00:23:43       Not supposed to post to

Speaker 6:          00:23:44       take with her on nitrates. Is that correct? Like men who have real serious heart issues, I believe.

Speaker 4:          00:23:49       Yeah. Now you have a very serious heart issue. You also shouldn't be fucking like a 12 year old and these things. Make sure you should. Well, it depends on what, what, what would it go? That's the way to go. It's a great, great way to go. But those pills you gave me. Hot Rods, $50,000. Those fucking things. Those give you like, like first time you see porn when you're a terminal boaters criminal like insane. Hiroshima, boner. You know why? Also why it's sold, where it's sold, because it's soda for gay people to go clubbing. Oh Geez. I mean a straight guys going take advantage of that. All that Boehner in the and the and the fucking thing. Man. It says on it. I researched this stuff, it says, and this made me think that our breeze, cialis theory was totally dead on because on the website it says that the ingredient is crushed up and I know amp owners, but that's something someone lying says. She's like saying anything. Nobody fucking cares. They have great boners. Don't care when you could say

Speaker 3:          00:24:59       that's hilarious. That's exactly what it saved. They're totally bullshitting. You know, what is it? Odds bugs crushed up and give a fuck what it is to make sure the questions I'm trying to sell some illegal shit. Yeah, I mean there's the food and drug administration ever shake loose a tablet and there's on an ad in this bucket, do they shake loose tablets

Speaker 6:          00:25:25       and then by the way, it might be possible that there's a toxin in certain answers that could give you a hard on because they know that spider has it. Sure does. That that spider in Brazil, the walking spider, it apparently it just wanders around the ground and if it stings you, it gives you the most in possibly painful Boehner where you dick splits open like a ballpark frank.

Speaker 3:          00:25:51       Yeah, you're done. It's super good.

Speaker 6:          00:25:54       Do Bird toxic. Okay. It doesn't just give you this ridiculous boner it most. Most of the time it kills people, but if it doesn't kill you, your Dick is done. Your Dick's broken forever. Why do we allow that to exist? That spider, it's a red lining. Dick bug it just red lines or dick.

Speaker 3:          00:26:12       It's like taking it

Speaker 6:          00:26:13       like engine deep into the fucking piston starts smoking ganja. I don't know why we allow that, but Jesus Christ, that's a scary fucking animal insect. Rather you dilute it down enough. You know, you mix it with enough stuff. It's perfect. Yeah. That's wonderful. Well, that's what they're thinking now. Spider. But they're trying to. They're trying to figure out a way to do it and apparently that's connected to nitric oxide and nitric oxide. I believe I'm saying it right is what is in a lot those like not to explode, like all these different sort of supplements. He's like workout supplements and get people pumped up because apparently Viagra, cialis, all those things, their, their performance enhancing its far as like your, your body's ability to pump blood like through itself and makes you more efficient and it gives you an endurance benefit. So I do. Yeah. So they're, they're making it. I believe it's illegal in the Olympics. I think he can't be on. I know you can't be on that pro provigil that provigil is illegal in the Olympics. They test for that shit now and I believe they test for this as well.

Speaker 4:          00:27:22       Yeah man, that provigils pretty awesome too. I, you know, I just found this, I started looking up like my favorite authors to see if they were on speed because I read and like the majority of my favorite authors are on speed and, and that. And that really got me thinking, man, that really got me thinking. It's like [inaudible] pro vigil, adderall. These are modern speed. It's speed. And forgive me for saying this man, but my experience with speed and Alpha brain outbrain is speed. Like you can call it an. I'm sure it has like thought enhancing things, but it's speed. When you take that drug, you feel that

Speaker 6:          00:28:05       he feels like Alpha remix. You feel speed. Low level adderall. Wow. I've never done adderall, but what Alpha brain does for me, it never makes me feel it's accelerated. We feel like smoother.

Speaker 4:          00:28:17       I. Yeah. It gives me a, it gives me a mild speed

Speaker 6:          00:28:22       bump. Wow. That's interesting. When did you, what do you do are you're doing the old formula or the newer forming? The new formula is more conservative because some people were having headaches.

Speaker 4:          00:28:31       It was the old formula. And what made me feel weird and it did give me weird dreams.

Speaker 6:          00:28:34       Oh yeah. The dreams if you take them like right before bed. I mean it's. Dreams are weird. It's like I don't know how to guarantee a dream. You know, people go to carroll for and fucking no dreams. You might have. You just don't remember him. Okay. And I don't know why you remember some of them. Why you don't, I'll go like days and not remember a fucking dream and then I'll do some Alpha brand or something and somehow or another I'll catch a dream. I'll catch a good one that I remember and I'm like, well then I'll start remembering a bunch of them.

Speaker 4:          00:29:01       Dude. I mean you dream every night. A fucking Alpha brain dream where I was in a garden. I was standing in this primordial garden and there was like fucking all these weird like silvery golden apples floating up in the trees. And I held this like weird silver mirror underneath it and it. And it made the, what the fuck are the front? What are you giving me this for? Why are you going to need. That's my, that's my emergency pack. That's actually what they sell. Now they sold like a condom with a guy pill and a girl pill together. So you give the girl the pill and then you take your pill. You wait like an hour. And it's like raging boners and vibrating vaginas. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:29:42       And there's the girl pilled do it. Just like the girl I was with said that just made her vagina feels like really tingly. Huh. And uh, the other day I didn't even know there was a girl pill. Well that's a fee. That's my emergency packs that I keep in my car. But uh, the other one, the other one's for five days. This was the one that is, uh, achieved a cheap one.

Speaker 3:          00:30:05       Dick's going to blow up. It's made entirely of wandering spiders going to explode. Yeah. Mega night. And some magnum condom, of course. Yeah, of course. Because you got a big giant dip, right?

Speaker 2:          00:30:20       No, it's because this pill makes you have a big giant it, but you have a big giant Dick Anyway. No I don't. It's pretty decent. It's a little bit of average. The girth is what's really good about it.

Speaker 3:          00:30:32       The chick say that's very important. You have like a shorter dick, but it was just stretch out a little bit more. What's the hook also like? I've always put my boner like underneath my belt, like my whole life. Like, so it's like facing my head, like straight up you smash it. Been smashing it and like bending it towards my face. The whole child. I'll never have a boner. I just put them behind my belt and then sometimes I forget about it too long and it hurts. So you like stretching your dick out the way those African ladies do with their neck and the rings pointed towards your own face. It makes it ben and grow towards your own face thing. So that's what urban myths on. That's just the shape shape at Dick's board with some people are born with Kirby as Dick's. The only thing that would really do it was trauma. You can get a broken dick. There's a dude named Ray lb who uh, is an MMA fighter who posted a picture of like a bunch of bloods shit and told his story on the underground girl got on top and she planned and less dick had broke his deck and it started bleeding. It can happen apparently, but in that can, that can give your Dick Funky, funky, right? Right Hook.

Speaker 2:          00:31:36       Have you sprained your Dick from having like I sprayed my dick recently where it hurt for like three days a week. Don't let crazy bitches get on top. You've got to control the situation, son. Anybody breaking your Dick because were on ecstasy and they fucking think this is an awesome song.

Speaker 3:          00:31:55       Yeah, a girl can do it. A lot of damage. If she slips on it wrong, she taints you. She takes you right on the crowd. It was bumped Boeing, right? The bone. Your Dick especially, she's got some good fucking thigh muscles and maybe she plays volleyball or something. Did it good at jumping

Speaker 2:          00:32:13       a duncan? I was listening to your podcast the other day and you see that you've only had sex on the road once, like you don't take advantage of the, the, like I've seen it

Speaker 3:          00:32:22       club, I've seen it. I saw a beautiful, crazy girl trying to get, talking to sleep with her.

Speaker 2:          00:32:27       Do you, do you not? Are you not a horny sex maniac or no? No, no man, I, you know, I'm really, I get really fucking horny. But um, like I, I, um, well there's two, two things. One, I tend to

Speaker 4:          00:32:40       have a girlfriend and I don't. I'm monogamous, so I, I, that's one thing. But when that's not happening, then generally there's this, it's like I get, I really get up in my head about it and so I think about, I overthink it like I'm way in my head about everything. Like I'm, I live in my head most of the time and, and when you live in, there's good things about living in your head and what, but when it comes to fucking and jumping into this primal, animalistic state that creates the best sexual experience where you just let go and, and, and it's, it's more difficult to meet, especially out on the fucking road because, uh, I consider the lead up to it and I consider the follow follow like after you fuck, you know what I mean? And it's like because porn is the ultimate, because with porn you jerk off to porn and that's it.

Speaker 4:          00:33:32       You don't have to like walk porn to the door. You don't have to like have a like porn. It's done. It's not going to call you up like porn that you've looked at is not going to call you up and be like, I'm fucking pregnant. You know what I mean? It's just done and so you just get this middle thing when you watch porn, you don't see the beginning, you don't see what happens right before the porn shoot or God forbid, 10 years, the, the, you know, the girl like walking in on her dad fucking a dog or something or getting fingered by her uncle. You just see this incredible, beautiful primal moment of fucking and you don't see afterwards, after the porn shoot. You know what I mean? That weird moment in the car, driving back from a porn shoot, you know, you wipe a little jazz out of your hair, you know, you don't use that whole thing.

Speaker 4:          00:34:16       You just get that one burst. Right. So on the road it's like fucking on the road. It seems like there's a lot of pitfalls there and a lot of weird dangers. It's a lot more than just like, you know, what a seven, what would be in his seventies movie, but like I said, I think too much. You know what I mean? I think clearly overthinking it. Satanists are all about doing that stuff. You know, I had a friend who was a satanist and he said that, uh, in life, and I remember it was really, it's really rough when it Satan says something that seems like absolutely true, but he's like, because you know, this is coming from a guy with lucifer tattooed on his chest, but he said, you know, in life he said, hell, hell is not someplace where you burn forever. Hell is that moment that you're dying. That moment when you're at your death bed or you're in the car, you're sitting at the car, wherever the fuck you are, you're dying and your mind goes back and thinks about all those opportunities you had to experience life to the fullest. All those chances you had to dive into life and suck the marrow out of life. And you did not have fear. That's hell now. That was coming from no hills way worse than that, that you can just jerk off and ticketing them if that's what your life is. That's not that bad.

Speaker 3:          00:35:38       What do you mean pink? Disappointed in life is not as bad as being tortured by Mongols.

Speaker 4:          00:35:44       Well, I mean he was saying how he doesn't exist, you know, the whole Christian idea now is nonsense. That the only real house since there is no how. Absolutely. If there was obviously if there was a real Christian, how are demons fly down and put their balls in your mouth and like slice you into bits every five years.

Speaker 3:          00:35:57       Wouldn't you be surprised if there actually was a. How fucked up would that be? If there was a hell of hell was real. I mean think about how fucking stupid you would feel if you were actually like being confronted by demons. They were flipping your eternal soul. They'd be like, motherfucker, I can't believe it.

Speaker 4:          00:36:16       They warned me. Yeah, yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:36:18       If you imagine, how crazy would it be if you got down there and there was a devil, some dude. He's got goat horns. Like,

Speaker 4:          00:36:25       yeah,

Speaker 3:          00:36:29       they just start ripping you apart piece by piece over and over again, and they put you back together again for eternity.

Speaker 4:          00:36:35       Well, see, this is the funny thing about hell, man, when you want to really get into the hell talk or the hell trip. I know people who've had held trips you've ever, you've probably never had the hell trick, the bad trips and felt like they were in hell. Where are you start thinking like, oh, I mean, because look, when you were talking about how we're talking about a torture chamber created by the general, obviously I did not believe this, but if we're talking about how it's a torture chamber created by the creator of the known universe, so it is the most advanced torture chamber that could possibly exist. It's created by the most advanced being psychotic in this case, but the most advanced being so when our real torture chamber the year means of torture, not going to be so obvious is like burning fire and it burns your skin.

Speaker 4:          00:37:19       The first thing you'd want people to think is that they're not in a torture chamber. You'd want them to think that there's some hope, some hope for peace as long as they were hoping for peace and thinking that there was going to be some moment of tranquility. It would like increase their levels of disappointment to the maximum. So that's the health trip. The trip is where you start thinking like, oh shit, this is it. This is how we've been. This is, this is the ultimate torture device device by some maniacal insane God that everyone's popped into and instead of like remembering where they're at, they're just like, oh no, this is totally normal. And gotta go through traffic in the morning, got to go through three hour commute. You know what I mean? That's how you don't even know you're there. You don't even know you're there. Maybe slowly you start with, I don't think that by the way, the opposite works too. You know, you can also think that this is heaven and you're just too dumb to see it. You get to this, you know, you can pick where those two a different mythological constructs

Speaker 3:          00:38:19       just abandoned those ideas and just deal with the present because it's the only thing you really know and we do know that when you live in hell, when we use that, all that guy lives in hell. It's a series of shitty choices, a bad circumstance, bad luck, combination

Speaker 6:          00:38:36       of all of the above. And, uh, most, most of the time when you use that term, Guy Lives in hell, you're talking about guys under someone's thumb, whether it's a, whether it works for some crazy company, you know, that, you know, demands him working 16 hours a day and his weekends. And you know, there's a lot of guys that live in how they're like executives of studios and stuff like that. Like those are crazy ass jobs. You know, what we're working in, you know what I mean? I'm sure like stock market along those lines, like anything financial, there's probably a lot of people that are forced to wear a crazy fucking hours. Right? That's right. And if you have like real restrictive work conditions, you have to wear a suit and tie. You have to fucking be very formal around the office. Nobody can fuck around, nobody can relax all day. Most of your day is just buttoned up in, locked down.

Speaker 4:          00:39:27       Yeah. Yeah, man, that's definitely one version of when you hear people say that they're in, how it's uh, um, but still, you know, there's this idea, you know, Krishna Murti ever heard of Krishna Murti? No, Jay Krishna Murti, he's this philosopher, the Indian philosopher who is like this kid who was discovered by the theosophists and theosophy were this strange spiritual group and I don't know a lot about them, but they have madam blood tasky and was the woman's name, but they spotted this Indian kid, uh, at the beach and one of them was like, his aura is amazing or something, and they sort of took this kid in and groom this child. Any eventually became this brilliant philosopher and a, as part of his, like evolution turned his back on theosophy and said, it's not that, you know, it's more. He got really into the idea of being in the moment.

Speaker 4:          00:40:17       And I actually, I wanted my podcast. I put a awesome sound clip of him talking about how the past you carry the past with you. The past is in you right now. It doesn't exist. There is no past. There's just your encoded memories of things that have happened. And the future is something you create through everything that you do. But there's no future either in. It's like you're this packet, like a d, like the DNA packet, the way their DNA for sort of spawns a specific type of cell. What you do with what you carry around with you in every single moment spawns your reality around you, which is why people who you know, you always will run into. People are like, I don't know why this always happens to me. I always get dumped. I just don't understand it. I always get dumped or I always end up in this predicament or that predicament, or the reason is you're like a caterpillar or a silkworm and you're spinning your reality with every action that you do because that's all there is.

Speaker 4:          00:41:14       It's just this, you know this moment. So you end up with a shit boss, you know, and you've ended up there just because you've been diluted by that, by your perception of time, you know that's the fucking trick because people listening to this habit shitbox shit, white shit, girlfriend, shit, husband, shit, whatever. You know what I mean? And, and, and this sound clip J. Krishna Murti says, the only thing that you can do is right now at this moment, make a radical psychological change in your apprehension of the universe at this moment, at this moment where the ship boss with whatever it takes this radical like you have to break free of everything you've been taught because we've all been taught to think that there's a future and we've all been taught to think there's a past.

Speaker 6:          00:41:59       There's also an issue that people have. This narrative has been sort of spelled out for us by our parents and then as we get old enough, when we get into our twenties or thirties, we really understand it. We were like, oh my God. They were just clueless. Folks just like we are like the idea that anybody had a handle on how to do this. Right, and then you just look at the fact that these people, I mean your parents and my parents are from a generation where they got into our age before there was an internet. I mean they're, they're literally, they're different human beings. It's a completely different style of human being to human being one where human being to human being three that are being born right now, you know that will only know insane levels of technological proficiency from the time that they're aware when they're three or four till till they're dead, when it's insane.

Speaker 6:          00:42:58       That's right. These are. This is the strangest times of all and no one knows how to run it now. No one knows how to figure this out. No one knows. The more information keeps coming in, the weirder things start getting the fucking meteors landing in Russia. The fact that no one even saw those coming and that there was a giant asteroid that whipped overhead within a day of that he asked and it was inside the outer band of satellites. Like there's. There's a whole lot of weirdness to this world that we live in that we're just not taking into consideration

Speaker 4:          00:43:33       at. All. Right. Well fuck yeah man. And it all started me and generally with people it all like that. That thing where we like just don't think about them as a species. We are living in the same way a modern individual lives as species as a whole is living in a state of delusion. The species as a whole is pretending that the most important thing is solving whatever little religious war or a territory based war or economic problem, they think that's the most important thing in the way we're living as a species is all based on the notion of there being a of the individual instead of the totality of the race. So this, this way of living is one of denial, so the human race right now exists on a planet where we blow each other up every single day, fight these ridiculous wars, fight against each other, and completely ignore the fact that we are floating in the void and this on the regs, on the regs, get smashed by fucking media whores. Now, why the fuck would we not be doing the obvious thing which would be in this situation? If the first thing you would do is figure out, okay, let's come up with a foolproof way to control media yours, then we'll then we'll fight. They don't fight it,

Speaker 6:          00:44:50       b one, and not only that, a lot of these asteroids that they're picking up, they're coming in from amateur amateur astronomers, like a good percentage of them.

Speaker 4:          00:44:59       Oh yeah, I know, but that's not that many professionals watching the sky. Well, well this is the whole thing. Or they say like one month know we stopped one month of war in Afghanistan. You know, you know that that number, right? If you stop the war for one month in Afghanistan, you could pay for everybody in the United States to go to college for free. Some kind of crazy number. Now that number, it might be two months. So in the same way if you consider that, you know what I mean? I wasn't saying it as a species are a priorities are a little weird and as an individual, you know people in the same way. They spend most of their time ignoring the fact that there is a subjective media or that's going guaranteed going to smash into your life at some point, which is old age disease and death. There's no way around it, so people spend their time ignoring that fact as well. You know, it's uh, it makes sense in a way. I mean, thinking about it so fucking intense. It's a lot easier to worry about your own personal problems. The little things, you know.

Speaker 6:          00:45:58       Yeah. I want to, I want to find this military budget cut thing. If that's true, done one month of the military budget. If you cut it out,

Speaker 4:          00:46:10       it wouldn't surprise me. Find out what the yearly military budget is and you know, it's like, look, this is this, this is the fucking thing that Neil degrasse tyson posts, which is like the picture of the media or whatever and this is why we need to work, you know, so I need to work on the space program.

Speaker 6:          00:46:26       Fuck, can we. Do you know what I also think, I think that schools should be free. I think we should be paying for, for whatever it is, college, high school, everything. I think I, I think school should be free always. I think it should be free and it should be encouraged and we should pay for it with, with our taxes, you know, I would rather pay for fucking, like a really high level school that kids could go to. Even if there are poor, I would way rather pay for that then pay for more military bullshit. More drones, drones above. I mean, you could do that, that, that, that could be something that can be done.

Speaker 4:          00:47:03       Sure. I mean that's the thing, but that it can't be done as long as we're confused as a species into thinking that there are, um, religions that are more important than religions are countries that are more important than other countries or people that are more important than other people. As long as we're stuck in that modality, well then we're never going to fucking wake up to the fact that we have to shift. You know, and it's saying the staff, you know, suddenly sound like you're seeing in Goddamn a John Lennon song, but it's fucking hit them motherfucking problem. I have a John Lennon is, he was banging Yoko Ono. Jesus, Dude, you're John Lennon. I donate, donate that sweet Asian. We've shown you the video of John Lennon with Chuck Berry singing when Yoko Ono start screaming and

Speaker 1:          00:47:47       the microphone like, Bill Bird does this bid on it. If you haven't heard this, you have to see it on youtube. Go find it on Youtube. Bill Burr, Chuck Berry, Yoko Ono. It's fucking hole.

Speaker 4:          00:48:01       But, but, but back then wasn't Asians more rare? Like it was almost like dating, you know? I mean because like all the war and stuff like that weren't easy to find. She's a dangling. I mean when, when we were in Florida, it's not that important that a person's race. It's not that important. It's like who the fuck are they? That, that, that, that checks alone. Yep. That was probably so in back. Probably like dating men hate.

Speaker 1:          00:48:27       That's what he loved. I, I, I don't blame them. It's the only thing that I disagree with them on. Everything else. I think he was brilliant. He's pretty brilliant man. I don't think anybody ever gets the whole package. Correct?

Speaker 4:          00:48:39       Well, no, not, not in one run.

Speaker 1:          00:48:44       How do you know if this is zero? I'm an old soul, you know, everybody always says that, you know, I think I've been around before. I think I've had many lives. No one ever goes. I think this is, I just, I was a rabbit in the last life and a fucking. This is my first time as a person. It's nice to be on board. Yeah, no, everybody is. Uh, I'm an old soul.

Speaker 4:          00:49:07       Well, yeah, there are a lot of people. A lot of Cleopatra is out there of Cleopatra. Everybody in their past life was doing something awesome. Yeah. No Shit. Whenever never finds out

Speaker 1:          00:49:18       there were just homeless. Just losers shitting on themselves, sucking dick for homemade wine.

Speaker 4:          00:49:24       A man that would be so fucking great to beg for crumbs, be able to like remember all those things. It'd be so great just to know, you know, in the way they can do your DNA tests. And they're like, whoa. You're like, you know, partially Scottish and there's some native American in there. It'd be so cool to like analyze all your particles and be like, Oh yes. Four percent of you came from the Alpha Centauri star cluster and the other two, you know what I mean? To be super cool to know like just the various star particulates that are, that you are comprised of the incredible or animals like seven years, seven years

Speaker 1:          00:49:56       percent cat. I heard this and I'm not sure if it's correct. So there's a disclaimer before, um, before I talk about it, but they were talking about, oh fuck, I can't remember this now of trying to. Uh, it's too, it's too weird. I, I'll, I'll get back to it, I'll get back to it. It's, I'm trying to remember how it goes. It's, I don't want to fuck this up. I'm going to look it up and make sure that I get it right. What about that couldn't terantin of video, but before that, what were we just talking about? Just before that we're

Speaker 6:          00:50:28       talking about tracing your weird DNA back and I don't know, I can't remember how he got there, what it was. Okay. So this is the, this is the, I don't know if this is true, but they believe that within the next 100 years they will have a computer that is powerful enough. You ready for this to take into account everything that exists today and use it in a numerical equation that will show everything that ever existed in every action and interaction that ever took place in the past in order to get to that position. So they'll basically look at all the buildings, they'll look at all the people, they'll look at literally every component on earth and that computers will be so powerful that from seeing what exists now and knowing the amount of time the earth has existed, the computer will be able to paint you and incredibly accurate samuel absolute simulation of every single action in its form, including whatever words you said to a girlfriend when you were pissed about that.

Speaker 6:          00:51:36       It's all just one gigantic equation. Every time you hit your horn at a red light, every time you said, fuck yeah, when highway to hell came on. All those things, you can literally know everything that happened based on everything that exists. Well, this is that. Yeah. Why? Why you say it doesn't seem possible, but I don't. Fart theory comes into effect. How do we know if you've heard it or not? Will the but this is the idea, but you're not really totally paying attention. I know what I mean. He was just kidding you. Okay. The idea is that when you can have. There's. There's these things that they're, they're coming up with and they were like, they're almost like the size of a large grain of sand or like smaller than a grain of rice and they can take photographs, video, they can send images, Wifi, wireless, Lee.

Speaker 6:          00:52:28       They can also have a gps locator, tells you exactly where they are. So essentially you can have a data bank of cameras with dust. You can spray dust over a city. Okay. These little powder things, they'd be everywhere. You never cleaned them all up and you would essentially have a rough picture of everything that's going on all the time. Yes. Once you got to that point, you could get an accurate account of everything that exists on the earth. All the water, all the. I mean, it's not outside the realm of possibility. If we can measure right now in our crude technological way, we're 200 years ago, we were riding animals and they didn't have cars. You couldn't take pictures within 200 years. We could do that. We can tell you how many acres something is. We can tell you. We can do a radio frequency tasks or whatever the fuck they do to find out what's in the ground with the is made out of. We can get a pretty rough account of what we've got around us. Well, if they can get to a point where they can literally tell you everything that exists and have it calculated everything that exists in this form on earth right now and know how long and know what we know about human history and put it all into account and be able to actually see a recreation of everything that's ever happened.

Speaker 4:          00:53:42       But here's the thing that the one little piece you're missing here. It's so funny. You're saying this because I got super stone and Vancouver and started thinking about something like this, but a good. Here's the thing you're missing. Yes, but you know what that is you just described. That's a fucking time machine when you add one more component to it, which is a neurological interface that instead of it's like you watching it places you inside of the recreation, so now you're able to zoom backwards through this like simulated past reality based on like, well if this happened before this, we can figure out what happened before that and there would be a kind of rate of entropy to based on like the further back you got, the less accurate your prediction of things that happened would be. It seems like you wouldn't be. I don't think you'd be able to perfectly. You wouldn't be able to do smell because there's no smell technology that know all the kinds of smells like apple pie, like could simulate. Maybe it could like actually kind of a good point. That's what your theory is. What was talking about?

Speaker 6:          00:54:38       Well, what I'm basing it on though is events and like things that have caused, like why would you ever go to the big island you ever been to the big island. The Big Island is actually the least popular lated. It's less populated than a Wahoo or, or a Maui, but a big one, half of a side of it is all lava fields. It's all just like, you know that that fucking thing exploded like recently, like within the last who knows how many hundred years, whatever, and there's lava rock all over the place. If you could, you could accurately say, okay, well this law has been around for 150 years and before that it was pastures and they actually have photos of it, you know, you could, you could, you could have hugged the locals. Describe what happened when in the 18, 20, the lava came over the top and cover the town. We can get sort of a pretty decent picture based on stuff like that. I don't think it's outside of the realm of possibility that they can get a totally accurate picture of history.

Speaker 4:          00:55:34       Oh wait, here's the other part. I forgot this is another piece of technology that you need based on the idea that you have this insanely advanced computer, right? Right. And the idea that they could count, you know, what they're doing with the human genome project. Somehow they finally pull that off with the human brain so that you can start doing brain scans and gather people's memories together. That's the other piece of it. So then what you end up having is instead of just having these particulates that scan the geographical makeup of the planet, you also have somehow the ability to absorb the memories and the actual, the actual, the memories of human beings.

Speaker 6:          00:56:13       You imagine though, if somebody else had to go and access your memories, you'd be like, what the fuck am I looking at it like it's just like bolary legs and you know, some girls bought where she shows it to you and uh, you know, a TV show that you barely can remember the plot. I mean, how fucking accurate is your memory? I mean, the idea of tapping into your memories and then putting it on. You'd be watching like the most retarded animated Gif file ever. That's what it would be really crazy. It would be like a vine video, but it'll be a little longer. It would be blurrier and blurrier.

Speaker 4:          00:56:52       That's so true, man. That's a funny thing you were saying. That's like an existentialist idea. That's an existential idea, which is this idea of like our actual lives when you consider your pov or so the opposite of movies and so the opposite of the construct of like some beginning and some ending in some middle place. It really is just this blur of like coffee's going into mouth, turn the radio, you know, but it's a significant moments come afterwards. You like sort of decide the significant moments and that's what you were late, but there's far more moments of just driving in between those significant moments or walking or like that. It's a very. It is a blur. Human existence is mostly just a blur.

Speaker 6:          00:57:35       Memory is a blur. Memories. Very sketchy. That's why people don't like Neil degrasse Tyson gets out of jury duty, so as he doesn't trust eye witness testimony. Right. Get out of here. But he's right, it's been shown to be wrought, mean people have gone to jail because of a false eye witness testimony with the people who were testifying. Yeah. The people were testifying, were absolutely convinced that they were right, but they were wrong and the wrong people went to jail. It's been proven. Sane happens. You, especially when you're under stressful situations. Who knows what the fuck you're seeing, what you remember. You know, I think a lot of these like bigfoot sightings and you know, an animal wild animal sightings. I bet there's a lot, a lot to that as well. I think when you're in a stressful situation, you something freaks you out with it's a bear or something.

Speaker 6:          00:58:21       All of a sudden that becomes bigfoot. You know the mayor runs off and you're like, yeah, let's fucking bigfoot, man. I swear to God I was big foot, you know. Meanwhile it's midnight in the middle of Columbus, Ohio Woods. All right. You can't see shit out there. How the fuck do you know if it's bigfoot? Yay. Columbus Columbus weekend. You know what I'm saying, Duncan? Yeah, I do know what you're saying, man. Can't trust eye witness testimony. You can try it. Yeah. If I got a hold of your memories and be like, Pataki, what'd you do to that baby? And you're like, no dude. That was a doll I got. I got a video in my mind, a baby

Speaker 4:          00:58:52       be getting waterboarded. It would just be. It wouldn't be so exciting. I think it just be murky and like waterboarding only works on babies and little esther. That would be incredible. If you water war babies and they start coughing up information, you everything. They know different languages. I like poopy carrots. Would would we be. Would we support waterboarding if. If you could interrogate babies and find out what happened before they were born, I think it'd be worth a try.

Speaker 6:          00:59:20       We know Alex Jones believes

Speaker 4:          00:59:22       at zero. Dark 30 was a government propaganda film supporting terrorism. That's not how they got that information. It's a lie. Yeah, man, you can't. You can't torture babies for information. No, no. Geneva Convention is going to allow that shit too. They even have a Geneva convention anymore. It's like a Geneva flea market now. Oh my God. That didn't even convention. That was against the Geneva Convention. There was a button that was like a big thing in movies. Right? So it was doing something bad. They're going against the Geneva Convention. Oh Jesus. You. That's a significant thing. It's like the constitution. It's generally the criminal knows the Geneva Convention. It's like, you can't do this because of the Geneva Convention. It gets left off the hook. The Geneva Convention. We need a. We need a 2013. We made it past the mayans convention. Just get together and go, listen, let's look at this. Realistically when. That'd be great.

Speaker 4:          01:00:19       When that bitch be fucking great. That's what I love fantasizing about, man. I love fucking thinking about that fight. That thing that finally happens when everything just. We finally turn away from these ridiculous, uh, our addiction to leaders. You know what I mean? And we turn away from our addiction to matter and then God damn it, man. It'd be so fucking awesome. We could really. We could win. I bet all of humanity just started working on it right now. Together we can whip up a spaceship that would probably traveled. I thought we could have a light speed traveling spaceship in 10 years. I think

Speaker 6:          01:00:55       one of the reasons why this podcast resonates so much with people is the conversations that we have sometimes where this is not an alien way of thinking. This is it. This is like a really smart way of thinking. It makes sense and it seems like it would be beneficial to all including the people that are in power, but if you hear that, if you hear someone saying something like that, you automatically assume that they're a fucking little. No.

Speaker 4:          01:01:24       Yeah, I know you're not allowed to say these things. There's like, there's just some basic truths though, and when you espouse, when you say them, people definitely get weirded out. Like when you do say the truth, the truth is continence weren't named that for them. They've already been named that for a very short time. You know, North America was not North America 2000 years ago. You know what I mean? That. So you. So you. So that's number one. Number one is the names that we've given. These things are not the real names. Number two is when you say that this is this country, well it is right now, you know, it's, you think it's going to be this country and 500 years, but for a lot of people it doesn't matter because it is right now, you know, it gives them like a like, look, I'm a fucking American bug off almond butter. Second Amendment rights are always weird. This is what America is about. Always weird,

Speaker 6:          01:02:16       but America is in a lot of ways about those people because those people represent a large chunk of the population. The people who want to keep the guns, the people that you know, like Nascar and that's what they like. As long as they're not criminals, as long as they pay taxes, America has to represent that and one of the ways you got to have some low level of patriotism type thing going on with them.

Speaker 4:          01:02:40       Fuck yeah. I mean that's legit. It works. It gets people pumped up. They liked rooting for teams like people, eight black people like tribal thing, and those teams are always fucking up and went back in the day, think about there was a great team. It was called the Christians and the witches and there were incinerating fucking witches and that was also part of being an American at one time. Well, you know, burning the witches, killing the Indians. That's just like part of being a Catholic at one time was being an inquisitor. You know what I mean? It's always weird that the team thing is greatest from a sentimental perspective and it's like, I get it. You want to be an American? Great. You want to love the country? Great. I do love this country. But guess what, I love fucking humans. Do you, uh, do you know the story behind what the latest theory of the witch trials? Yeah. Or got. Yeah, tripping balls. Yeah. Yeah, that's awesome.

Speaker 6:          01:03:34       The latest theory involves a premature for frost, like, uh, they were growing wheat apparently. And uh, when, when they have like a frost, when the plants freeze and then thaw out, sometimes they get weird funguses. And this one, they did some soil samples and they found that there was sometime around that area around whether it was doing the Salem witch trials was they had early frost and they had the. I think they found evidence of this stuff, this or God stuff. It's very common though and on wheat and what it. It's like acid. I mean it's basically very similar to take in house. That's awesome. If that's true. Well they bought. They're almost positive. They're almost positive. That means scientifically it all lines up because they know that it's happened before that people have gotten. They've gotten wheat that's been poisoned by it and they've gotten sick and they've had hallucinations. So if you've got a whole country or a whole city that's eating the wheat for who knows how long that's filled with God. But there's some speculation as to whether or not it would be still psychoactive after you baked it. I've seen people that disagree with it, but in my opinion, I mean it. It seems to be a likely

Speaker 4:          01:04:51       candidate. Well, there's also the thing where there was like an oppressive religious structure, confusing people and are thinking that there was a devil. Yeah, he could just be a high level percolation of crazy. It could just be let's burn, which is let's take the ship to the next level

Speaker 6:          01:05:06       and then, you know, we got to blame it on something because I mean, you look at the stuff that, I mean, people are getting burned as witches in Africa right now and they're not. There's

Speaker 4:          01:05:14       no, there's no ergot. Usually there's just a bunch of Horny, angry guys who want to fucking torch a bitch. That's what it is, man. And it's like also, it's, it's the, it's the, uh, it's the uh, you know, it's, it's the, it's the bad version of like the, of the, of what they call the patriarchy to. I mean, the fucking witch burnings. We're just the same as us, like killing the Indians in a different way. It was like there was a religion that existed before Catholicism came rolling through planet earth and that religion was what we call paganism. She's country dwellers is what that means. Just people who are more in tune with the earth knew about herbs and stuff, didn't. Um, that's why, you know, all of our holidays are fucking weird. All of our holidays are. They'll mismatch there. All mismatched weird shit that we don't really understand based on Jupiter and like just strange fucking looper Kalia is what Valentine's Day is, is looper Kalia.

Speaker 4:          01:06:12       You know about that. You know what looper Kalia was? What's a park? Holly is fucking crazy, man. You would get like am Valentine's Day around Valentine's Day is called the festival looper. Cali and looper was some kind of Wolf God that the Romans worshiped. So what you would do is you would, um, as I recall, I looked it up on wikipedia. You can look it up guys, and you'll find a much more detailed, not spelled ultimate looper. Kalia, L U P E R c a l A. Yeah. Read that Shit. That's what Valentine's Day used to be a. But St Valentine of course was a saint. A Catholic saint.

Speaker 1:          01:06:48       Yeah. Looper. Kelly. That's how you spell it. Looper. Cali. Um. Wow. This is amazing. Yeah, it's interesting. It's very interesting. Ancient. Possibly pre Roman pastoral festival observed on February 13th through 15th to avert evil spirits and purify the city releasing health and fertility,

Speaker 4:          01:07:09       but read what they did, dude. They whipped, they like, or they will, like there was flogging involved in this festival is very strange, but that's what, you know, that, that proceeded. That was the religion that proceeded, uh, uh, the one that is the currently the dominant religion and, and that old religion didn't get, didn't, they weren't just like, you know what, we're not going to worship the wolf. Got Anymore. It was that they were getting torched and I don't think it was based on eating like fungus. I think it was because the, uh, the, it's to combating paradigms that, that didn't. They don't work together at all. And uh, I'm not saying either one isn't necessarily logical, but one is more based on the way the earth works. And the other one is based on the way like old dudes try to control people. That's where that, that's, that's the, I mean, this whole fucking pope thing. To me, it's crazy and hilarious that we even pay attention to what that clown is doing. How is that even making the news? There's some weird fucking group of people who do like the most bizarre ceremonies who I mentioned sanctioned by

Speaker 6:          01:08:21       governments in mass media. No one calls it a call to the guy's wearing a fucking wizard out with a fish head hat. It's if you try to do that today and tried to say, I am a daughter of God. He has brought to me this information. He tried to set up a shop. They would think you were fucking loon, but because of the fact that it's been around for a long time, this guy has a direct lineage.

Speaker 4:          01:08:41       We're supposed to take it serious where he's supposed to take it seriously and we're supposed to fucking ignore all the Shit Catholicism did. Well, how about this shit

Speaker 6:          01:08:48       he did. He released a priest that had molested 200 deaf boys, 200. He let them go, Huh? He let them go into psychiatric. Instead of bringing in and getting them prosecuted, they brought them in for psychiatric treatment and this guy went on to. They went to another parish and he molested more boys. I mean, it's fucking craziness. He did that time and time again. He took people away from being prosecuted and sent them to psychiatric care and and they're free. They're free to go. They're free and they're walking around the street. Some of them are in these huge religious retreat places that they have beautiful grounds and these guys are just wandering around taking care of for the rest of their lives and the trauma.

Speaker 4:          01:09:27       There's a place like that where I live or. Yeah, there. Yeah. So. Right. So that's happening and they don't pay taxes. They don't pay fucking taxes. That is fucking okay.

Speaker 6:          01:09:37       Crazy. All that shit is crazy. The idea that they should be able to make golden buildings and not pay taxes. Bitch, are you out of your fucking mind?

Speaker 4:          01:09:45       Can you fucking imagine that's a business? It's a business. It's a fucking business. You're not. No. You don't talk directly directly for God. It's 2013. Stop. Stop your bullshit. You're not telling the truth, you don't know that much. I don't believe you. I think you are very charismatic and there's a lot of people that want to believe you and they'll go along with it, but you're talking crazy. God's not talking

Speaker 6:          01:10:09       can new stupid. No, you're an asshole. You're an asshole and you'd taken their money and we got to make sure that this stops with our generation. We got to make sure that future generations don't. They don't have a gigantic religious leader. Someone who tells them based on some nutty shit that was written thousands of years ago by people drew on animal skin,

Speaker 4:          01:10:31       but also it spreads that the way that looks with [inaudible] is just one version of the problem. The other problem is the guy who calls, you know there's like an in the way there's a pope. There's also a dude who calls himself the president, but instead of representing some phantasmo forest called God, he says, I represent the will of the people. Yet he doesn't really represent the will of the people. It doesn't seem like that when he goes to when, when, when they do the polls and that as it turns out, you know, and I'm not just the president, of course, the government as a whole, the president doesn't have to tell attarian power, but I don't think that the president really represents the will of the people and I don't think Congress represents the will of the people and I don't think Senate represents the will of the people any more than the pope represents the will of God and I think it's this image, this imaginary thing that we're supposed to believe in because it makes us feel more comfortable as though these people are really enacting the will of the people.

Speaker 4:          01:11:24       I think the will of the people is that we want peace. We want to be able to like, we do want security, we want education, but we don't want fucking war war with Iran. We don't want fucking war with Iraq, Iraq, Iraq. How the fuck do you say? And I forgot to say that I got some start up. We don't want it. Nobody wants war. And if there is, it's a small faction of people, sweaty red face cock suckers, you know, or like that awful thin fucking scarecrow con and coulter, Jesus Christ, she's like something that Baphomet fucking coughed up like a hairball. That Satan or rejected. Did you see her getting booted? The Libertarian Convention. This fucking. Oh, she fucking had the audacity, like in front of the Libertarian Convention, she said they were asking her like, you know, do you think gay people can get married? And she's like, yes, gay people can get married to members of the opposite sex.

Speaker 4:          01:12:22       You Bitch, you dirty tap dancing. Scandal is bitch. She's such a beast, man. So anyway, what I'm saying is there's a small, there's a small faction of these pigs. You know what I mean? That grabbed the spotlight and produced this illusion. And, and, and, and, and certainly the one of the great illusions is the idea that the pope represents God. Governments represent the people. Television represents reality. What we have happening on this planet is a dramatic cases of misrepresentation coming from a small minority of people who've managed to grab power. And this creates an illusion that people try to live by, and the reason everything's all fucked up is because it's not based on what's really happening.

Speaker 6:          01:13:05       Yeah, and I believe that's one of the reasons why government likes to keep religion in positions of power and keep them tax free because it helps when people are in big groups. It helps when people are already indoctrinated to the rules of the group because then you're more likely to be a person who listens to rules. The real issue with absolving all religion is not the denial of the existence of God, but the denial of man's knowledge of exactly what God is, who God is, what God wants, and instead I could do is base it on the wisdom of ancient teachings that we know to be true today. Lot of that is real. Being able to treat people the way you would want to be treated yourself, in fact, treat people as if they were you living another life. That's how I. I literally try to do that.

Speaker 6:          01:13:52       I try to do that. Gets a little taxing when you're like, why am I such a fucking loser? And this other life, you know, it gets annoying, why am I a dickhead and this other life. But if you, if you just think about some of the things that people associate with religion, the, the, the, the, uh, the ideas, the good ideas of charity and love and family and the values of virtue in your ethics and the way you think of, of your, your, your fellow citizens, your fellow humans that you're in this colony with, that's, those are all really super positive for the most part. It's mixed in with a lot of scare tactics and fear and nonsense. And who knows when that was all added. That's the real problem. But we know when we feel great, we know when we feel filled with love, when we know when our life is at its best.

Speaker 6:          01:14:37       And it's real simple. It's being around people that you also love. They love you, you're unconditional, you're all friendly, you're all happy and not having a bunch of shit that bothers you as far as like, man, I should have been a singer or man, I should've played baseball, or man, I should have given it a shot. Or man, why didn't I call her that night sale? Sorry, but I have to be whatever the fuck it is. Whatever it is, when you have regret, when you're in that weird state of regret. I'm very extreme with that because I tried to be like, I'm very harsh on myself as far as like a monitoring what negativity and positivity and making sure that I'm in like a, a good, a good track and when you, when you judge yourself to be like in a bad place or that can really distract all of your creativity.

Speaker 6:          01:15:25       When it can, it can completely fuck with any new positive things that are moving forward. It's instead you've gone onto correction duty. Then you have to look at like how did this sort of behavior manifests itself? What was the cause? Is it alcohol induced? There's an insecurity and Derek's like, what? What, what happened or that were the combinations of factors that led you to be a Douche bag, you know, and yeah. Yeah. What was, what was, what was wrong with, you know, that made you have a mediocre set. What was the thing that was bugging you? Were you sat in front of your computer for two hours, you couldn't write chet. What is that? Well, you got to stop whatever that is, stop whatever that is and make sure that doesn't happen again and we have to sort of figure that out along the way.

Speaker 6:          01:16:07       We. And that's one of the weirdest things about being a human is we're all sort of figuring this out as this thing is in motion. And I always equate it to being like we woke up in the middle of a starship that's hurling towards the planet and we're like waking up, hitting all the instruments going, okay, where are we? We're going $75, million miles an hour. How close is that planet? Okay. Are we gonna? Are we gonna? Hit that plan. Does anybody know how to wear the breaks? You just think turn. Okay. What happened? How did we get here? Who built this fucking ship and how long we've been asleep. I mean we literally are in the middle of a, not just a process, but like a journey, a process of constant reevaluation and ingenuity and innovation where this technology that we're surrounded by increasing in its power and ability like tenfold every couple of years.

Speaker 6:          01:16:59       So like he's crazy quantum levels where they're coming up with quantum computing and they're talking about the ability to put google glasses on and communicate with the fucking world all at the same time. There's this, this time that we're at right now is just, it's, it's almost as if we pick the perfect spot for the most action, like the perfect spot for like the birth and emergence of technology into the forefront of mankind. Well, you know that a lot of new age or a say is that the reason that the earth is so populated right now is because so many different beings from infinity, from the multiverse or wanting to incarnate right now because it's such an exciting thing happening to the planet. That's a great way of looking at why are there so many entities and currently right now because there's only, you only get one thing like this thing went up.

Speaker 6:          01:17:55       Planet pops, you know, and it like wakes up. It's like a really beautiful thing to be a part of. I love them. I love that model. I don't necessarily believe it. And you have love that. That's a very empowering Melissa etheridge style model, but it's mostly because porn is more accepted and people are having more crazy sex and are open about sex. Right? What younger people are having sex younger. That's why there's so much of a population boom at this time because. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, because fuck exactly the same amount of porn and Oh, poor, poor and actually probably stops them from fucking as much because they jerk off. I don't believe that the early 1900 [inaudible] it's all about family and stuff. People aren't having crazy sex or you know, your history son. What do you think the roaring twenties were those all people fucking like wild animals.

Speaker 6:          01:18:39       Doctors were giving abortions? No, it wasn't in New York City, man. I think your perceptions of the world are a little off. The thing that brought people were very conservative back to being conservative was the great depression. So before the Great Depression, which was in the 19 thirties, we, they were fucking going bananas. People were going crazy and that was the roaring twenties. They had speakeasies checks were getting banged dudes. We're living in a bachelor or putting cocaine and coke. Yeah, dudes were living a bachelor life to the point where pool halls were. There was I think four times more pool halls in New York City than there are starbucks today. There were over a thousand pool halls in New York City at the turn of the century because people were. Kids were gambling. What do you mean kids like young, like nowadays that the average person having sex for the first time, it was like 14, 15 years old back then was probably 21, 22.

Speaker 6:          01:19:32       No, no, no. You're wrong. No wrong. Yeah, you're wrong. Yeah, no people. It's. We always have. People have always had sex at a young age. Boys and girls have gotten together at a young age forever and fucked. I don't imagine that there's any more or less fucking than has ever existed amongst teenagers. If you leave them alone, they fuck you know, and who fucks more than Catholic school girls. You really think religion. Religion is going to stop you. Religious is not stopping a crazy bitch with a, with a moist pussy. If you leave almost any animal alone with it. Fuck, I don't buy that. I don't buy that. But the conservatism that we think of from like the 19 fifties will, that was in response to the fact that Hitler had just come along and world war two came along and our grandparents had to fight the Nazis.

Speaker 6:          01:20:18       You know, my grandfather worked in a plant that made a part for the atomic bomb. That was always the big thing that they were. What do you brag around the house? You know, a grandpa makes a, a part in his factory that is for the atomic bomb. You know? So the, the, the conservatism that I think that came in the 19 fifties, the fear, the McCarthy era, when everybody's like, you comment someone's a comment. So we were worried about Russia doing the same shit we had just seen the Nazis do. So then the sixties come along, boom. Everybody finds drugs and free love and hippy shit. And the government is like, what the fuck? Like stop this, like we're losing all the government saw a bunch of soft men running around in sandals getting raped by Russians. The Russians just come over here and just store my beaches and kick us into the fucking dirt. Everyone's on acid. Nobody wants to fight anymore. We're going to get overtaken by the Russians. Not commies are everywhere. Did you go to the communist manifesto? Dinner? I just want to know is all about black list head. There was like a wild frenzy to stop the drugs and to stop, stop communism and establish the hippy bullshit and, and you know, and put more power back to the government.

Speaker 4:          01:21:23       Well that's the, that's the thing I, I've been thinking, dude, is, is it. I think that there's basically two religions in the world and that one religion is a religion. Religions pray that wrong or for when I got cancer, my mom's dying. I've had a weird fucking year and in all the turbulence man like behind it, this is what's crazy. Batch really severe catastrophic things happening in your life is like, and why they call it an apocalypse. Personal apocalypse. Apocalypse means lifting of the veil. You know, it's like you see this fucking thing behind all the turbulence. It's really weird after you've like gotten the initial prognosis or after you find out the bad news that you know, you go into shock kind of and then that faith and you pace around the process process and in this fades away and this fucking thing hit me. You know, and I felt it when I've been on a lot of psychedelics. I think you've kind of talked about it and you're your dmt trip story, but God damn it. It's this fucking thing behind everything that's saying everything's gonna. Be Okay. Everything's gonna. Be Oh k. and you feel it. It's not bullshit. You're not delusional. You really pick up on this thing,

Speaker 6:          01:22:41       what you feel is that you're caught up in the idea of this small loop being the big picture, that this small loop represents your reality and it's so important to you because you have loved ones and because you have car payments and because you have a job that you enjoy, it's so important you this loop, but then it allows you to see that this loop is just a and an infinite ball of yarn that goes on forever and you and you look at it and just go, okay, and it's going, it's going to be okay. You're like, okay. Because you realize that life in the universe and everything we find everywhere we look, it's fractal and that it all is infinite big. All of it is infinitely small and infinitely big and it exists everywhere we look. There's no. We never found. Well, this is the end.

Speaker 6:          01:23:35       This is the end of matter. Here it is. Yeah. It hits a wall and then there's nothing behind it. No, there's no wall, man. It goes down to subatomic particles that blink in and out of existence. They're in a super position, so they're in two different places at one time. They're moving and still at the same time. It's fucking madness. They disappear and they come back. We don't know where the fuck they went and they can measure it, but they don't know what it means. And so I, I feel like it's probably gotta be that with just life in general and everything. Consciousness in general. I think we're clinging onto this one particular consciousness and this one particular moment in time because I think the human race is here to do something. I think we're a part of a process like bees making honey or aunts making an ant hill and that all of our wackiness, whether it's ego or sexuality or you know, the need to conquer whatever these things are, they're all a part of this gigantic calculation to bring us technologically to the next level.

Speaker 6:          01:24:40       Whether it's because we're worried about the other guys doing it first. Whether it's because you know, and that's how the, the, the movement represents itself represents itself through the fear of military conquest by the, the other. So we have to hit this technological superiority first, like sorta like the moon race. You know, what, whatever the fuck it is. I, I, when I, when I look at the, the idea of our inability to grasp what we're doing and our continued movement in the same crazy direction like especially when it comes to war and, and the lack of respect people have for poor people and the lower classes and the lack of resources that are put into raising the backup. I almost look at it like it's, it's natural. If you look at every other animal's behavior, whether it's wolves and the Alpha Beta representative in the wolf pack and you know, the way they have the social world structured, even if it's cruel.

Speaker 6:          01:25:36       We see bears eat their cubs. We understand that this is nature bears one of their favorite things to do. Grizzlies, they get up earlier before the females do in the spring and they go and hunt for baby baby bears. They're going to go into the dense on purpose to eat the babies a phase. Yeah, motherfuckers. Right? But that's natural. And we know that's natural. So we see it and we go, well that's natural. That's what nature wants. It's we, we're the only thing that we, that can stop nature. We can stop the equation. We feel like we are intelligent and aware and we are capable of stopping the equation that we find ourselves in and I'm not so sure if that even makes sense.

Speaker 4:          01:26:17       Here's why. This is the thing. I thought I was reading this great book about Ip holders, so. Yeah, sure. Dr Brian. He'll tell you about boners. Brian, what? What about that new ps four that you're not excited about it, Huh? No, I don't care.

Speaker 4:          01:26:40       I'm mildly excited about it. I'm excited about the next generation of these things coming out. Not as excited about the new xbox, but I think it was pretty cool. Have you been playing games at all? I haven't. I haven't really been playing games. Yeah. I love playing this game called far cry three. Oh, you really? Yeah. That's what we're changing the game for you. Well, it's funny because the characters in it are Douche bags, like they're like, they're really a cheesy storyline. It's like a bunch of actors get kidnapped by like tribal peppers and it's very funny that the way that they communicate with each other, like we're going to get back to Santa Monica, Bro. It's really weird, you know, like they've, like, they all were in the film industry or something, so it's cheesy. It's like a chance to. And also like the main character as he progresses, gets a tribal armband that keeps growing on his arm. Like it's definitely the game seems to have been made by somebody who is like definitely into techno and cocaine, but it's still a very fun game. Little Esther's watching us right now and I've been having a side conversation. She wants to get fake boobs for real. She's just trolling, you know, she's, she really does want to fake boobs. She has a nice rug. That girl.

Speaker 7:          01:27:55       You try to think of him.

Speaker 4:          01:27:56       Yeah. I've never seen a little asterisk boobs.

Speaker 6:          01:27:59       Apologize for that. I'm usually very professional. What comes to my urine? He gotta go, you gotta go drink a Kombucha. Before the whole foods started getting the new Kombucha is in again. Do you know that a Kombucha tea, like when you get it like Gts, Kombucha or synergy? They. It was like more than one half of one percent alcohol. So you had to be over 21 to buy and you still have to be over 21 to buy it, but they just got it back on the shelves. They had like a diluted form of it. We just still healthy. The kombucha still good, but it's not as good as the. The True fermented live culture, Huh? Yeah. It's fucking delicious. So good. You get. If you did get a taste for that. It's so healthy. I'll drink a diet coke and feel like a loser. I just like, what am I doing?

Speaker 6:          01:28:44       What am I doing? Do I want to fuck my body up? Like why? I'd rather drink a coke because I know it's just fatty. I don't know. What the fuck these natural or unnatural sweeteners do for you? I don't know. I don't know what the fuck they do. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know what's dangerous and what's not, but know sugar just gets you fat. I mean, it might give you diabetes, have you got a wacky system, but basically just gets you fat when you take that. Aspartame is significant evidence that point that that stuff causes cancer, like brain cancer or. I do. I eat a lot of that shit. Yeah. I don't think you should take a lot of aspartame. Linda's six splendid Trenta iced coffee. I think the only shit that they've shown that's really safe is Stevia. Stevia is eventual even taste that good.

Speaker 6:          01:29:34       No. Even lately there has been some shit on Stevia or he'll. Yeah. Oh, I haven't heard that because Stevia is a plant. What's that stuff? This syrup a Gavi. It's pretty good. That's what I have is actually not good for you. It is so disappointing. The Gavi is high in like a sugary syrup. I had no idea. I thought it was fine. It's not like honey, honey is actually good for you. A Gaba is not good for it. It's just sugar. What a mess, but it's not bad for you. I mean, it's like the real problem with sugar is if you get it without all the other shit that it's attached to, like if you get sugar from fruit, it's not nearly as bad for you is a spoonful of sugar. You take a spoonful of sugar in your body just like jolt like that.

Speaker 6:          01:30:18       You're not supposed to get that in that forum and when you drink a coke, you're drinking like several spoonfuls just pounded it into your bloodstream. I wonder how many spoonfuls of aspartame is in a diet coke? No one's done that. I've never seen that. Even juices. That's the criticism of fruit juices. The criticism of fruit, fruit juices is you're getting far too much sugar like you, you're really supposed to do is drink water and eat oranges. Like. Because when you eat, an orange is attached to fiber, it's attached to cellulose. All the different plant, whatever the fuck the orange to the fruit is made of. It's like you're just supposed to get that. That's, that's the, that's the nutritional package. It's supposed to get fiber along with it. You know? It's like one of the reasons why Kale shakes are show so good as opposed to juicing.

Speaker 6:          01:30:59       Like this guy, the whole foods was talking to me about that. Like, do you juice? I said, I like juicing too. I like juicing. Juicing is great for getting a lot of chlorophyll, a lot of like you can get like highly concentrated like Greens if you juice, but the fibers really good for you too and when, if you can just choke it down, you know, and not a lot of people are like, oh my God, what are you eating? Just choke it down. You mean your Kale shakes? Yeah, those are disgusting. I got to go ahead, go piss you say they're nasty, but they're so good for you man. And I can't tell you how many people that I've run into at these shows that like, this one dude didn't in Anaheim this weekend. He said that he lost 200 fucking pounds. He showed me a picture of him standing next to Dan Henderson and he was like, or is it Ben Henderson?

Speaker 6:          01:31:45       Hm? Not sure. Blurry picture. Um, I forgot to ask him, but he was enormous and now he's like 200 pounds. I was like, that is insane. I go, I go, that's incredible. He goes, dude, it was just listening to the podcast. He goes, you guys changed my life. He, I started thinking about things positive and realizing what can I do to affect my quality of life. So I started drinking Kale shakes every day. I started working out just a little going on, walked 200 fucking pounds. This guy lost. It's crazy. Let me check this out. Oh yeah, yeah. This is. And by the way, that 200 pound things, that's just one of them. I ran into some folks in North Carolina. They had lost over 100. One Guy, the guy lost 100, the girl last 90. I mean we run into it all the time. It's nuts.

Speaker 6:          01:32:28       It's unexpected with this is what we're about to play is Quintin Tarantino, who is one, talked about this before, but this is an unconnected. This video is Quinn Tarantino, my favorite director of all time. If you, if you tell me like if there's a new Quintin Tarantino movie, I know I'm going to have a good time. You guys are nuts, but I'm like a lot of nuts. He's, he's nuts and he's a, he's a brilliant director but he's a chameleon socially. And I noticed it when I was listening to him on. I had the Sirius Xm in my other car and my last car and uh, listened to him. He was on stern and he sounded almost a feminine, like almost gay or very, I should say, very submissive. Maybe. I don't know. What we're looking for is autistic. Maybe it's that. Yeah, he might be that or maybe he's got like, um, maybe he's asperger's or something like that.

Speaker 6:          01:33:26       But. So then he goes on, opie and Anthony. And then when he was on Opie and Anthony, he was one of the guys who like, you know, open anthony or like regular guys, you know. So you go on that show and Jimmy Norton stared talking about trannies and you're like, I'm one of the guys were, one of the guys were hanging out here. Guys. We're hanging out, guys, guys are hanging out. Then he goes on the Jamie Foxx show and he's black and it's not really like sounds black and sounds like an old white guy trying to talk and he's talking black to, you know, listen, you want to talk about black dudes who are bad motherfuckers. Okay. Then there's obviously in pop culture or in athletics and you know, there's been many, many African Americans that have pulled off some staggering shit. Jamie Foxx is a mother fucker. Okay.

Speaker 6:          01:34:11       Jamie Foxx, one didn't even like her grammy. He could sing. It's fucking Dick off. Okay. You hear him sing when he did, when he played Ray Charles. That motherfucker is talented. That guy can play. He can play piano. He seems like a fucking, like, like as good as a professional. Famous singer could sing. I mean the dude's ultra super talented. He also has his own radio station. Okay. He's got the foxhole. It's like. Yeah, it was Jamie Foxx. He asked me. He has. Well it's your name is. Why don't I call it the foxhole? It's his place there hanging out. Right? So quintin Tarantino in the face of hanging around with this, you know, Uber, man, you know this, who accomplished so much. This is a freak success story in the history of the African American race that he liked morphs into a black guy when he's talking to them. Let's see this shit and it's really awkward. Well then that was, that was on the radio, but this is something that I saw on the Internet the other day where other people are starting to pick up on this and this welcome

Speaker 3:          01:35:19       writer, director and Academy Award winner acquaintance. He knows all these black fellas and ladies hanging out on this cool set for the Django and they're asking them questions here. Has to be like one of the most quoted movies in Hollywood with just the lines and everything. So you got to give us this. One of my questions for you is, what is the most famous like Yo, your favorite line from pulp fiction? Uh, I think probably the most famous line is I'm going to get married but on your ass. Okay. That's not too bad because he's like warming up for the

Speaker 6:          01:35:53       oppression. But pleasing your fans or pleasing the critics for you?

Speaker 3:          01:35:58       That's an interesting question actually. Um, um. Well, I want to. I want to please my fans. I don't want to police to critics that I'm a fans. The critics and fans, I don't give a damn. He rapped. He is wrapped into an impromptu rap. That was one of the most uncomfortable things. He's a visionary director. Division of that girl wants to work for him. Ooh, she's hot too. I wonder if she would fuck them. I'm not that computer savvy. So Athena sent me something that I plugged into my computer. I don't know if I would ever heard it hit download this. I don't know how to do that. Alright then Jamie. My man. Yeah. Yeah. Jamie Foxx. Fox sitting here going, man. Motherfucker. Rick Ross and the whole plastic. By the way, that's the same as Jackson. Jackson is very uncomfortable. Look at him. He's not even taking that fucking microphone away from his Dick. Like. So I can lady and said, I need 100 black preachers with a black sir. Go over to carry with my little tape. We're going to plant. Isn't it possible though?

Speaker 2:          01:37:14       This is some kind of weird conceptual gag he's doing like he was backstage. I like, I'm just going to do this for no reason. It's isn't it possible at some inside joke I made, it does remind me of something that my ex girlfriend, the dude just because she likes like kind of like trolling every single person she talks. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I got it man. With someone like Quentin Tarantino who is clearly a fucking genius. I've got to think first. This is some kind of gag. That's what I think that that guy is so cool, man. Just because you looking for a conspiracy and everything. I don't know. Maybe that's just me. I go, oh, he's a loon. I think it's brilliant. I think has aspergers, man. I think he just gets uncomfortable or nervous and he doesn't even realize he's doing

Speaker 3:          01:37:56       it, but I bet you're right of, look, we're making fun of the guy. Okay. It has to be done. Doesn't mean I don't love him. He goes to fucking awesome. Thanks Jane. I had an amazing director, but that Shit's hilarious. It's hilarious when you're a different person in three different places, but you might be right. It might be that it's gotta be a gag. Yeah, let's check this and I'll get took it home and I played on going. This is the bomb

Speaker 2:          01:38:22       before. My movies are always filled with song, but it's always stuff that I chose for me than my own collection or something like that. I never had like a music supervisor hooked me up with stuff. It's always stuff. I chose a of the reason. I know. Watch this. I just want to show him to write something and then they do red nose reindeer. A Charlie Brown special. What was that one with Fred Astaire? Is the mailman a started. He's narrating a Santa Claus is coming to town.

Speaker 3:          01:38:49       Yeah. At the end they're like, what is, who are you? I was trying to find that he has speech he did at the Oscars. That was a really good one because he was in front of like a, you know, like the highest of Hollywood people who's being very respectful. So his voice is. And how he talked, it was very accurate. Like it was way better example than that. What we just saw there. It was super white guy. What a strange fellow man that is using. Man. He's awesome. I love him. I love him to love him. He makes the best movies, man. His movies are fun. They're all fun. They're all wild chaos also. You know about the theater he bar right? They either theater in La that only shows it. It's in. It's not in Santa Monica. I can't remember the name of the theater.

Speaker 3:          01:39:30       The theater he bought like a theater with it shows like only film. Yeah, it only shows shit that was shy. It doesn't show anything digital. So like you go there and they show all these old grind films and stuff and like it's just bad as in like it's not a profitable place. He just does it because he doesn't want digital to takeover which it is, which is going to happen. What's going to happen anyway, but it's still cool though, just to have it like that silent theater. Is that still open? Yeah, it's open. Yeah. That's pretty dope. There's a silent theater in la where you can go watch a silent movie. Yeah. That's where Doug Benson does all his movies where he watches a movie and then talks while the movie's going on. He watches at the Senate families at the theater. It's called Santa Fe. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          01:40:12       So He. He watches a silent movie and then talks over it. No, it's not. It's not in the mood. Just a regular movie like top gun and then they just sit there and pretty much common, you know, that was an also an issue. A quintin Tarantino issue is Roger Avery apparently was the guy who wrote that whole top gun gay connection thing. That was like Roger Avery's baby. And quintin Tarantino did it in a movie. Yeah. He was in a movie and he like chameleons. Roger Avery and told the whole top gun story. It being sort of a gay love story and when it really represents, it's really brilliant, you know? Have you ever seen him pull, pull it up? Quintin Tarantino explains top gun because it's a. it's kind of a trip that Roger Avery was a really

Speaker 6:          01:40:53       brilliant guy. He wrote killing Zoe, did you ever see killing fucking fantastic crime movie? It's a fucking great movie and it's very, I don't want to say pulp fiction like, but exciting in that same way like pulp fiction is. I don't want to tell you anymore about it, but it's killing is always one of my favorite movies. So fucking bad ass. It's like, it's just really well done. And then my cat, after that I had a cat named Zoey. Um, so Roger Avery who created that and also cowrote pulp fiction with Tarantino and you can see like when you see like a killing zoe. And when you read some of his, he was the one who got in trouble for tweeting when he was in jail. Remember that? Nope. Roger Avery was in jail. I think he drunk drive. He was uh, he was uh, he, he was driving truck and he killed somebody.

Speaker 6:          01:41:46       I think he got in a car accident. Killed one of his friends. Oh yeah. And he had to go to jail for a while and he was tweeting from jail and there was like some sort of a, um, a controversy with the fact that he was able to tweet from jail. So they moved here. They want them moving. And I think because of it, I think it like he really got fucked over because of it. I think. I'm not sure if I'm telling them the exact true story, but he, um, wrote these really interesting tweets from jails. Really fascinating. Let's talk about the different social things that are going on and this guy across the hall. So the guy owes him money. This could get ugly. You know, it's really fascinating shit. You know, that he would talk about, you know, God is getting bribed and dudes smuggling heroin up they ass. This is

Speaker 7:          01:42:35       what's it really about? What's your, what's like it? It's like a stick. This is fine. This one sentence like, boy meets girl, I don't give a shit about them. Fuck boy meets girl. Fuck motorcycle. You know what is really being said? Which really basically that's what you were trying to about because the whole idea man is the version you want some version on a massive level. You don't want the greatest fucking scripts ever written in the history of Hollywood is top gun. Top Gun is fucking great. What is top gun? You think it's a story about a bunch of fighter pilots. It's a bunch of guys waving fixer. It is a story about a man who struggled with his own homosexual. That's it. That is what top gun is about, man. You've got maverick, right? He's on the edge, man. He's right on the line. All right.

Speaker 7:          01:43:21       And you got ice man and all his crew. They're gay. And they are. They represent the gay man. Alright. And they were saying go, go. The gateway. Go to the game where he could go both ways. I'm going to go. She's, she's, she's heterosexuality. She's saying, no, no, no, no, no. Go the normal way. Play by the rules. Go the normal way. They're saying no. Go with the gateway. The gateway, the gateway. That is what's going on throughout that whole movie. He goes to her house, right? It looks like they're going to have sex, you know, they're just kinda sitting back. He's taking a shower and everything. They don't have sex and he gets in the motorcycle, drives away. She's like, the fuck. What the fuck is going on? Next scene. Next scene. You see her, she's in the elevator. She gets dressed like a guy.

Speaker 7:          01:43:57       She's got the cap on the theater classes. Do you want in the same jacket that the iceman where's? She goes, okay, let's get this guy. This guy's going towards the gateway, so I got to bring him back. I got to bring him back from the gateway, so I'm going to do that because I'm going to dress like a man. That is how she approaches it. Right? Okay. All right. But the real. And they get the movies mix at the end already gets it. He has passed over into the gateway. They are fighting for beating the Russians. All right. And it's over. And they fucking land and iceman. Maverick the entire time. Finally he's got it. All right. And what is the last fucking line? Did they together all hugging and kissing and happy with each other and ice comes up the maverick and he says, man, you can ride. You can ride.

Speaker 3:          01:44:56       That's so great. Yeah, that's brilliant. You are Roger Avery and you wrote that Quentin Tarantino movie that would suck a Dick that tax and apparently quintin claims that co wrote it together. I don't know. I don't know what happened, but that's a fucking brilliant analysis. Whoever wrote it. Quintin or Roger? Every. Whoever wrote. That's a brilliant. What's that from? That's from killings, let. No, no, no, no, no. I don't know what that movie. That's A.

Speaker 7:          01:45:25       I don't know what the movie was.

Speaker 3:          01:45:28       That's not killing. Is that what you know now? It's from something much more recent. No, that's not recent. That's actually really. I think I had much more killings. Oh really? Yeah, I've seen that before. A long time ago. Okay. Well now we need to figure that out. Pull it up. Find out what, where, where it came from. Um, but I think killings. Zoe was in the nineties, wasn't it? I don't know. That was. Yeah. I was like, great fucking movie. Man.

Speaker 2:          01:45:52       I love that. That's what making movies is about as sleep with that 1994 with me. Yeah. So I saw that long ass time ago because I was addicted to Quintin Tarantino said to see every single movie that Quintin Tarantino isn't job. Have you seen this Microsoft thing that they announced a four. It's supposedly for upcoming xbox and what it does is it takes a picture of your room. So like say like your tvs on the wall. It takes a picture of everything around your room and adds it to the game and it's fucking trippy. Check this out.

Speaker 7:          01:46:25       Oh.

Speaker 2:          01:46:26       So imagine like a video game in the future

Speaker 7:          01:46:34       scanning room and saying shit on the wall. But Watch, watch, watch this book show. Pretty soon it, it knows the bookshelves there

Speaker 3:          01:46:50       and so it looks distracting as it looks better when you see it in hd, the low raza, the thing makes it look like shit. Oh really? What we're looking at. Oh Wow. It does the, like it really manipulates your environment. So it adds it to the game. Like oh wow. So it highlights the bookshelf and the. Yeah. And so like, like it showed like it should have

Speaker 4:          01:47:20       pixels, pixels were coming at you, but it knew the floor was there so the pixels would kind of ride the floor and stuff like that. It's cool man. That well it seems like that's where it's all going to go right now. It's going to the fucking oculus rift dude. That's where it's going. Fuck the projectors. Shit. Have you seen the OCULUS rift? What does that have you seen videos of people with the OCULUS rift off? It's, it's this like consumer based virtual reality helmet that's coming out that is apparently so insane that when people wear it and they hear someone talking near them while the rift is on, it's confusing. It'd be like you sitting here right now and suddenly a disembodied voice starts talking to you because it like fully like. It's like apparently incredible. There's videos of it out there. If you've seen those red band got to show people putting it on the lenses credit. Fisheye effect I got to do is give you the headset.

Speaker 7:          01:48:15       Yeah, he's going to where you're standing. You would have your body, your brain just naturally just telling you to start walking, you know, it'd be a really good way to put this on someone's head and they're like, inside of like a train tunnel and have them walk towards the light, come out into the world

Speaker 4:          01:48:38       right when he puts it on,

Speaker 7:          01:48:39       walk up to like one of these buildings basically.

Speaker 4:          01:48:43       And we can't see what he's saying though. We just see a guy with some crazy

Speaker 7:          01:48:49       good to see for yourself. That candidate Anthony. Okay. So he's going to put it off for the first time. Taking the red or the blue pill. Just adjust a little bit. Someone that's pretty good. Looks pretty good to me. So before you take off running through the streets of this village, you know, I want you to look left, look right, look up, look down shit, and actually look at 180 degrees of turn your body and look at me. Basically Ryan would be phenomenal. So you do have all three 60 head track. Wow. So first just take a look at some of the snow. The snow is, it's all stared at. So you should see some nice depth to that snow. You feel like it's falling on, you're going to kitchen.

Speaker 4:          01:49:43       Wow. So they finally figured it out. Well they, yeah, they've had it for awhile. They just haven't been consumer based when you know and they've got to like the other interesting thing and one of the other interviews I saw as they're talking about when there are wasting it and they say obviously they can't release it until people designed games for it and that it's not as simple as just plugging it into a game because the size ratios are off in a game and like the characters running around in the game are either bigger than a human would be, are generally smaller than a human would be. So for it to really work, you've got to design a thing around an actual human size. So it's really, it's a really strange. They've got to go through and redesign games based on this fucking thing.

Speaker 6:          01:50:25       Nobody works harder and longer hours than game designers. God Damn drives work some crazy hours. Do you remember when we were hanging out with cliff, he beat and it was getting close to the release, one of their games and they said they would just sleep in the office, that we just sleep in the office and worked for weeks at a time and like loved ones would come and visit them at work. They would just be gone. You've worked forever and just to to to meet a deadline to get a game out. Yeah. It's a crazy world of video game development. That's a lot of hours and that's a difficult

Speaker 4:          01:50:55       and so weird that like that, that those guys don't have like an Oscars that's going to be in the future. Like now we get these guys. You like regurgitate wind, somebody wrote and we're like, oh great. What about these people who are God's creating virtual universities that you can run around inside of? Yeah. That's no joke. That's no with code, with code, with fucking code. They're not even. They have to type lines of code to that invoke virtual reality. There's so many alternate dimensions with code. Yeah. It's insane, and then you're going to be able to pop on and fucking oculus rift and suddenly be existing inside of world of warcraft. I call that my last day on earth.

Speaker 6:          01:51:36       That's going to be that in the hamster wheel.

Speaker 4:          01:51:39       That's the one fucking problem and that's going to be the final thing is that

Speaker 6:          01:51:43       I think they'll just create a warehouse. You know, they'll just. All you need is a gigantic warehouse space, so you have a warehouse space and you designed the virtual reality game for whatever the space is like. Say It's a airplane hangar, giant fucking Costco sized building with no, no trees, no nothing. Where aware we're pole is replace it with a tree and boom, you're off to the races and so you stay inside this building and you live in a reality totally created for this building.

Speaker 4:          01:52:10       Or are you just plug some shit into the back of your brain stem that makes you feel like you're moving and gradually just transformed a big fat wow.

Speaker 6:          01:52:18       Yeah, and the other problem was if you had a a warehouse, the real problem would be the only things that you would come in contact with or things that are touching the floor couldn't really come in contact with anything physical and the virtual reality sense, unless you're dealing with some sort of recreated neural impulse. Right? Like a, a fake touch of fake. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          01:52:41       It's got to be a fake. I mean you can't, you either. You would either have to have someone in. There is a ball of virtual reality ball thing. You can roll in. I've seen it, but you either have to have something like that or you would have to simulate. Well you'd have to have your brain movement.

Speaker 6:          01:52:54       Your body convinced this actually touching the tree. So it feels a tree. Yeah. Maybe if it was so convincing that you or your fingers responded to it. Yeah, he gloved. It doesn't make sense though because would be some went to touch a tree and it wasn't there. Your fingers would just go right through it. Like you would have to. It would have to stop it.

Speaker 4:          01:53:13       It have to be a magnetic field that conform to some kind of shape. It would have to be some way that something you're wearing responds to a magnetic field and it creates the sense of a shape being there. You know, something like that. Horns can be amazing. Be Amazing.

Speaker 6:          01:53:29       Yeah. It's going to be just insane. Fucking Asian together. Be able to. You're going to be able to dial up a bunch of people just blowing you all at once, like fighting over a spelling. It's going to be like, hm, well would I like today? Monogamous relationship, Ronda Rousey's hand job

Speaker 4:          01:53:44       and it's weird to think that the one industry that's never going to stop making money as Kleenex. It's just always fucking exist.

Speaker 6:          01:53:52       Get biodegradable man. They just go with washable towel socks. Nothing wrong with a little. Some hemp towels to clean off your loads. Yeah, there's. There's never, never going to be an end to that is always going to be cleaned up. I always got to wipe your loads. Tantric and you absorb them all and you become even stronger is not the idea of tantric that you like you. You hold on your lows, your body reabsorbs you orgasm like ours. Ours internally. Does that shit work? Have you tried it?

Speaker 4:          01:54:25       I don't know if that works, but I know that there's a woman who had a disease where she constantly orgasms and she wanted to kill herself. Yeah, right. Bragen bitch. Far as like, oh my God, I'm coming again. I want to kill him. You seen that interview?

Speaker 6:          01:54:40       Stop it. Stop it. She's putting on an act so those, those bitches that can't come don't kill her. So it's the only way she can exist in with her. Her wealth of Orgasms, her wealth of coming. She's like existing amongst the common poverished women who never come and she's older ages. That's what women want to do. They want to come. If you could come all day, he would come all day. If you can come with the same feeling, the same like release that you do when you haven't jerked off for like a week. You know that when you jerk off with like bullying comes power and out. I mean, it's like there's a lot of force behind it and get you get some distance. If you could do that three or four times a day, you would do it. You'd be doing it constantly. If you have the same room.

Speaker 4:          01:55:23       This is something I always thought is of course, yeah, like if there's a. If there was like an orgasm, are you taking. You have a nine hour orgasm, but this woman made me think that maybe that's not. Wouldn't that. No. They were like, she was in hell. Would it be too intense? Maybe she's one of those chicks just complains about everything. Can you mention just, wouldn't it be cool just to pee though? Like, like,

Speaker 3:          01:55:44       like, like a minute long p have just come out really critic crazy. There's so much more mass to come. Where were you going to be storing it all? It watch your whole body. Just your. It would be like a lava lamp tour so it shrinks down where were were. You were like 60 percent loads backed up. Your toilet's overflowing with lowe's piled onto the floor. I joked around about imagine if sperm just ran like you shot your load out and they just fucking around around the house just trying to find a uterus. They didn't stay put. They did. Ran like an

Speaker 4:          01:56:17       well yeah. I like based on the. Maybe somebody out there in the Internet can help us figure this out, but based on the size of a individual sperm, how big would a giant have to beat as shoot a load where you could see the sperm swimming inside of it.

Speaker 3:          01:56:32       Wow. There's a boy that died who supposedly mastered baited 42 times in a day and he died. Yeah, that's in Brazil. Right? Who knows if that's true. Somebody could have just made that up. How does it kill you? How does he like jerking off? That's not what killed them. Killed him. He probably didn't eat already. Starved to death or he fucking fell and hit his head because he was tired. The jerking, jerking off going to kill you. I don't even understand what you're saying. Maybe you had like the abrasions caused you to bleed out. I don't know. I'm. I'm looking for A. I wanted to go back to that aspartame thing because I'm looking at and aspartame and uh, when you look on the Wikipedia, um, it doesn't seem like it's that dangerous. Well, I mean if it was slightly dangerous, I doubt would be in coke zero. You know why? Yeah. You gotta wonder like how many fucking people are taking it? I think it's just like the science.

Speaker 4:          01:57:23       Tammy Faye Bakker, late stage cancer videos. Is that from diet coke? He was addicted to diet coke and there's no correlation. No connection. I mean except for the fact that she drank. She was one of those people who was addicted to diet coke and drink boatloads of. No, I'm not saying there's a correlation that I.

Speaker 3:          01:57:40       It could have been super, super unhealthy and all sorts of ways. Anyway.

Speaker 4:          01:57:43       Yeah, there's just something. It's never been proven. It's never been proven. But there is like, there is a, I think there is like a, some people do think that diet coke, like you just said causes cancer, you know, and she drank a fuck load. It was like her. She would have like something, some ridiculous amount, like 15 a day or 20 a day. Like more than you should ever have.

Speaker 3:          01:58:07       Wow. That's crazy. Bitch. Do you remember? Rest of soul. Do you remember when that whole Jim Bakker, Tammy Faye Bakker controversy was going on? Oh yeah. That was. That was brilliant stuff in the 19 eighties. That was brilliant.

Speaker 4:          01:58:21       Great. Saturday night live thing like what was the thing God was going to kill him if he didn't get a certain donation level or something. Is that what his thing was? Well, he his this

Speaker 3:          01:58:29       thing. I don't know. I don't know what happened there, but it all. It was basically just an affair. Right. So Fair with Jessica Hahn. I Dunno why it became so popular. Why did it become so popular? That was new in the day like nobody

Speaker 2:          01:58:42       was having an affair. I like that.

Speaker 6:          01:58:43       Yeah. I guess that's what it was. It's funny you look at it now. It's so time, right? What affairs and well, in a fair by a preacher with a secretary, it would never be something that we would talk about 30 years from now. If it happened today, you know, it's like we, it's like finally we got one, remember what's his face got busted. Jimmy swaggart got busted with a prostitute and he was crying about how he said, have you ever seen that? Ever seen him crying? Yeah, it's beautiful. It's so beautiful. It's like one of the most instancy or things you could see a person doing their life and when you watch it, it sort of inoculates you to insincerity because he gets a look at it. Go, oh, that's what it looks like. No connection to reality, no emotional connection to their words, no connection to me as the person receiving these words.

Speaker 6:          01:59:30       It's almost sociopathic. Sociopath. Again, it's craziness and it's beautiful. It's beautiful. It's one of my favorite things to watch. Let's watch. I haven't seen. Pull it up. Hold up Jimmy swaggart apologizes for silly bitch. And then there was the other guy who said he saw 900 foot Jesus in the middle of the desert. That's what I was thinking it was. No, no. One of them was like legit. Jimmy Swagger is the guy who got busted. Who saw the 900 foot. Jesus, I don't know man. Your religious coots. No, I like them. No, they're really are. They're amazing to watch you. You liked that dollar guy. Creflo dollar. I record his shit. I. I know you're talking. I record his shit because it's so ridiculous.

Speaker 3:          02:00:19       I want to address myself as best as I know how to those that I have wrong that I have sent against. He'll go out and get hookers. First of all, my wife Frances. God never gave a better helpmate and companion with the possible exception of that sleazy who? What is this and as far as discussed, fully playing this one man. Funny Shit is real and cut.

Speaker 6:          02:01:05       Yeah, don't put this fucking parody bullshit on it. It's this cool. Watch them cry.

Speaker 2:          02:01:13       It may be dark days for the swag, a church, but as the Sky Clinton, English people are talking about you. There you go, and I would skip it today. They knew all the details.

Speaker 6:          02:01:30       Oh man, these mother fucking false prophets. Yeah. It's an interesting thing that we have this just deep, deep, deep desire to believe that someone has answers. Leadership Addiction. Yeah. What's a chimpanzee shit, right?

Speaker 4:          02:01:48       Yeah. Leftover Championship. Well, it's, no, it's the guy. The thing is, man, there is a underneath everything there is. I think this is what makes me different from a lot of people. I think some people don't believe this. I think underneath everything, there's an intelligence that, uh, that's filled with love. It's just love that thing when you were on Dmt and saying, I love you, I love you, I love you. I love you. I think that thing is real. And I think that that thing, you don't need a leader. You don't need someone to tell you what that thing is saying to you. It's your own relationship with that thing and how closely you can approximate what that thing is saying that defines your level of happiness. Uh, in this incarnation. And there's, there's people like that who falsely represent that thing who don't have never really experienced it. And that's why it seems like bullshit.

Speaker 6:          02:02:37       Yeah. It seems like bullshit to everybody who hasn't experienced it. And when you run into extremely angry people that just have pitfall after pitfall in their life and the miserable experience after miserable experience in, you know, you realize that they're just so separate, so, so far separated from the frequency of happiness, you know, and it sounds like some hippie bullshit, the frequency of happiness really. Hey man, some people just live in an economic downturn where there's a shitty economy where they live and there's no jobs and, and they were born ugly. So they're fucked. Yeah, that too. But there's also people that live like that, that are happy as fuck in that same environment and they have great friends and wonderful experiences with their loved ones and they're not constantly embroiled in bullshit because they figured out a way to orchestrate their environment. And that's one thing that we somehow or another are sort of responsible for. Dylan.

Speaker 4:          02:03:32       Exactly, man. I mean that's the important thing that the point that you're making there, that's the most important point is that it's like, sure, people are going to have. You're going to have to task trophies in life. Everyone asked catastrophes. That doesn't mean you're bad, that doesn't mean you're wrong or that you've or you're cursed or anything. All that matters is how you react to that and all that in the only way that you're going to react to that in any kind of way that's not terrified is if, if you found a way to feel grateful is something Tom Green set about getting cancer as this amazing, uh, a description of the feeling that comes when you have cancer. He said it's a combination of terror and gratitude, you know, and it's like, because once you get it and you get passing on a fuck, I get to live.

Speaker 4:          02:04:19       It really is this sense of like, my God, what a beautiful thing this is exists. The terror things never going to go away. As long as you're living in space, you're going to be terrified. We're in a fucking void, meteorite hit as etc. Etc. But thEre is, once you find that, that plate, real gratitude, not gratitude, where people shake their finger at you, that you should be grateful, but when you really plug into that fucking thing, god damn it, man. Everything lights up. It doesn't matter if you're. You know what the thing is, it's happening to you lose your joB, your wife's cheating on and you're cheating on your whatever the thing is, if you plug into that underlying thing, fuck, it's a beautiful, beautiful place and it's a very subversive idea. The idea that everything is okay and that behind everything is just this field of just the happiness frequency does that stuff

Speaker 6:          02:05:05       feeling? That's the hardest thing to overcome in life when you started out in a certain direction, if you'd gotten fairly far in your life, but you're really miserable and you have a lot of obligations and you have lots of expectations and bills and a lot of issues that keep you in the certain shitty environment and people don't know how to manage that, and I think that's why one of the most important things to stress is get off on the right track as quickly as you can with your life. I mean by the right track, I mean, whatever the right track is for you. I don't want to say don't listen to your parents because you might be an idiot and your parents might be dead, right, but you might have an idea that your parents can't wrap their fucking puny brains around to you. You might be talented in one way, shape, or form that your father doesn't want to see his creation go off to be.

Speaker 6:          02:05:58       And ultimately you are your own person. You, you really. There's so many people that have lived their life for other people and they're miserable. You know, I've never met an ecstatic son of the owner of a business who runs the business with his father. I always see a man who probably would rather have carved his own path in life and it's just caught up in the wake of another man because that other man raised him. You know, they don't, but you, you see a guy who runs his own joint, you know, and like they're fucking happy and they have like zest and whatever they're doing, whether they're. They run a pizza place, you know, I mean, I've met guys. There's a deli that I go to all the time and canoga park cabaretta, the guy who owns a dave, nicest fucking guy in the world.

Speaker 6:          02:06:37       He goes, always smile and laugh, and the people that are happy says joint. You know what I mean? I mean you. It could be anything. It could be a restaurant, it could be a, a fucking starbucks that's just hooked up, right? It's your spot. People like go in there, you know, it's like a little spot where people can have their own little positive, happy energy as long as that's what you want to do. Whatever the f you want to really run a starbucks or run a coffee shop or run a fucking jazz studio, who gives a shit, whatever the fuck you you're drawn to, you've got to do that, man. That's so fucking important. And people with their, their escape clauses and fucking parachute plans and well, I can always pull out if this doesn't work and I got a backup here and then I got a backup there. Man, you better not back up too much, but you got to travel light. You got to travel light psychically. You have to have very, very few options if you really want to make whatever the fuck it is happen in a very few of them.

Speaker 4:          02:07:36       I love this. When you remember when we first got to be friends, you said something to me when I was sitting in that fucking desk working as a talent coordinator. Stuck is stuck if be dude like really fucking stuck, you know, I like, I can still remember flash, you know, like when people say things to you sometimes and your brain goes and takes a picture of freeze frames that because it's like you listened to that. I listened to that and I remember sitting there talking to you at the shitty fucking desk job and you're like, you just got to jump man. You just gotta go for it. And you just gotta jump in. You just gotta go for it. And man that, uh, I knew you were right. But god dammit, what a terrifyinG thing it as they hear that at first, you know, it's, it's a terrifying fucking thing, you know? But, and you know, maybe making like if I jumped right when you said that it might not have been the greatest time, you do have to have a little bit of strategy involved in it, but yeah, you, there is a where you are right now and there is where you want to be and the distance between those two things will create a vertigo.

Speaker 6:          02:08:42       Well, you had the most important thing, which is the thing that you wanted to do. You wEre good at. You want it to be a comedian. You were funny, you were creative, you original. So that was the most important thing and the most difficult thing to get. And I was like, this other stuff is what's holding you back. Well you need to be doing is just focusing on this thing because you're awesome at it. All you have to do is just do it. Like the ability to do it correctly once achieved doesn't really go away unless you lose the fucking plot. You know, you lose the frequency in life. I mean if you're a comic, I expect to expect to get better. You know, I feel like I've had better sets like these last couple of months than I've ever had in my life. I've had better moments I think on my moments are better.

Speaker 6:          02:09:22       I think like the like new bits are coming together in a better way. Like I'm super super pleased with things because I'm concentrating on it because I've worked at it for a couple of decades and I think that as long as you recognize that that's what happens, that as long as you live your life the way we were talking earlier, the right way without too much bullshit and distractions, too many negative karmic moments that flood you with regret and fuck with your creativity. That's one of the most important things about being creative. One of the most important things for me is being nice when I'm, when I'm like as nice as manY people as I can and I'm as, as easygoing as possible and as forgiving as possible. I am the most happy. I'm my most happiest when I'm dealing with people and like being forgiving and, and, and being friendly and then I have less shit on my mind.

Speaker 6:          02:10:13       And then I can tune into creativity because I don't understand exactly where my creativity comes from, but as in, you know, a lifetime of trying to figure out what, what frequency I tune into when I do my best, whether it's drawing or whether writing or anything creative for me, I have to have all these ducks in a row. And the big duck is my own psychic psychic, but my own consciousness, my, my, my appraisal of my own consciousness. How am I, how am I interacting with this world that I'm finding myself in? Am I out of control and my fucking too much gas on a break. So my too much breaks down enough gas. Uh, what am I, what am I holding myself back? Am I limiting myself with my diet? Am I limiting myself with my actions? Am I limiting myself with my. What am I doing in Missouri?

Speaker 6:          02:11:09       Is everything cool? Okay. Now if everything is cool, then I can go to work. But if everything's not cool, I have to figure out what the fuck is not cool and fix that. And if I don't fix that, it'll be bumpy. It'll be the whole thing will be me trying to duct tape this fucking ship together while it reenters orbit and fucking keep everything from falling apart, but as long as you give yourself an honest assessment of how you're thinking and how you're interacting with the world, that's where it gets fucking hard to do. It's hard to take that first step and give yourself an honest look at yourself, give yourself an. And then once you do that, then it has to sort of become an ethic, you know, and you've got a welcome and when other people do it too. Even haters when haters like point something out about you.

Speaker 6:          02:11:53       That's correct. You know, you got to like accept that like, yeah, sometimes they get ya. Sometimes they're right, you know, you, you did something douchey or you were a little weird there or you could have reacted a different way and it doesn't even necessarily mean you're meant to. Like sometimes you just get picked door number two and it's like, what am I even saying this for? You start saying something, it's not even doesn't even represent necessarily how you feel. it's just a possibility of how to react and all of a sudden you're off to the races and then you're like, nah, you know. I mean, how many times have we said that in the conversation as well? Maybe that doesn't make sense. You know? It's like you don't even know sometimes when you're saying things, but when someone calls you out on that and they they put it's probably good for you.

Speaker 6:          02:12:34       It's not good for them because a lot of times haters get fucking completely work. You figured to hope you sucked full of million. Duke's you drone world of semen and aids and this is the people that get completely ridiculous with their hate and almost all of them are losers. That's a real problem. When you look at like what a hater is, there is no successful haters. There's no like bill clinton, stop fucking commenting on youtube videos. Fucking queer, you know, it's like no one who actually accomplished anything is a hater, but being a hater is important for people that are trying to accomplish things like having critics and hate can actually help you and fuel you and make you aware of the broad spectrum of human behavior, especially like in a void of love and absence of the correct. Like you don't lash out like that unless you are in an absence. Let's see you an absence of love and absence of personal pride and accomplishment of absence, of feeling good, like you don't feel good so you lash out because if you wanted to, you could find something everyday that you hated and just fill your day with hate all day, anger and hate. You could just do that. You could just do that, but you only do that if you're an idiot.

Speaker 4:          02:13:48       Yes. Yeah. You're an idiot. It's not idiot, idiot. It's, it's. You're stuck in a terrible path. Yeah. You're stuck in a pattern.

Speaker 6:          02:13:58       Terrible pattern. That is. It's not. It doesn't help you in any way, shape or form, and in fact it limits you by keeping you in this sort of, this, this, this negative mindset.

Speaker 4:          02:14:12       It's hard for me to relate to those haters. You know, the, the new internet breed of haters, because I didn't have that when I was like a lot of douche bags I can relate to because I can think, oh yeah, I was that kind of douche bag. I know what that kind of douche bag is, but internet haters is more difficult, you know, like a tweet, tweet haters. But I've noticed that if you get hate tweets, I'll go to their timeline. Sometimes they're all hate and it's all hate. You scan down and it's just one vial thing. There's many. It's like they've got a list of people and they just are like launching vileness it as many people as they can. It's a strange, not just like one every five. It's like if you have 40 hate tweets in a row, you've gone beyond irony. Now you're just, you're crazy. Like now you're just some weird lunatic firing missiles into the void for no reason. It's very strange, man, but other than

Speaker 3:          02:15:06       you're and you're choosing to do that, you're choosing to try to reach out and affect someone in a negative way instead of concentrating on your own life

Speaker 6:          02:15:15       like you have made it more important to do that. Then anything else you were doing right then because you chose it, you chose it as your writing. Those things. You chose it above any self improvement. You were doing any creative work. You are doing any business work. You were doing, any personal emails you've got to get out. No, no, no. You chose to call someone you know a terrible name on twitter like you chose to say, I hope this a dumb cunt drowned in a river of aids. You decided to put that onto dallas. Your. That was your choice at that moment. Unless it's really funny. If it's funny, then it's different.

Speaker 4:          02:15:53       It's funny. You're not going to 50. You know what I mean? If it's funny, you want to have 50, but it's like when you go and look and like not only is the person just insulted you, there is an insult to like, we're too fucking yet. Just like anderson cooper, I've seen these, these

Speaker 3:          02:16:07       texts, the beaver do say they want to kick the years, ask idiots. Mma fighters are constantly dealing with them. Yeah. They, they'll like and they'll troll you. They'll, they'll get you locked in on, you know, uh, an argument and then you go back and forth. One of them that I thought was really hilarious was a, there's a woman who's a, a comedy writer, and she got into online twitter with a

Speaker 6:          02:16:30       chris brown. Oh yeah, yeah. Jenny was her name. I can't remember if I. She's a, she's a very funny but yeah. And people like, he viciously attacked her and that's what I go. Why would he do that? So then I read it and he's like, damn, I'm looking to old. And she, she goes, uh, yeah. Isn't it funny being a complete piece of shit as a human being tends to age you? I'm paraphrasing. I don't know exactly how she said it, but uh, and then he went at her and this and that, but she started it like he didn't beat her up. Okay. And this is like years later to have someone sniping at you constantly. It's got to be annoying and I'm not sticking up for chris brown in any way, shape or form or anybody that beats up the girlfriend. But she started it. She, she decided to tag him in that and, and, and tweet him and fuck with him and get him to react to her. And everybody's like, oh, he viciously attacked her. Like, listen, don't put your finger in the cage if you don't want to get bit, you know, he beats up women. Okay, and whaT are you doing? What do you, what do you, what are you doing by stirring it up with him? Yeah, exactly.

Speaker 4:          02:17:33       She instigated a dummy, dummy reacted. She analyzed his psychology. She knows this is a man who will swing it. A lady, she came out and won some sassy shit. And it's like, it's, it's like throwing salmon in front of a bear. Clearly. But

Speaker 6:          02:17:48       that's not how they reported it. It was. He viciously went after her, viciously attacked her. When she started it, she was dancing.

Speaker 4:          02:17:57       Enjoy. The moment that dumbed down were responded to her. She must've done a fucking tap dance.

Speaker 6:          02:18:01       I wonder because I would think that if there's a guy who's like really violent and you're a woman, I would think just the fact that that guy knows who you are and you can't defend yourself if you ever ran into him. Chris thought, yes, absolutely you don't think of crispr. She said a bunch of mean shit about him and he, he saw somewhere he might palm her face inspire mansion. I'm saying if no one was around, no one was around in her mind. She has to realize that if she ran into that guy and no one was there to protect her and there was no security cameras, there was no witnesses. He might do something to her. That's reality. Okay. And that feeling is why it's dangerous. That feeling is what I mean. That has to be in her head. You start fucking with a guy like that.

Speaker 6:          02:18:43       The beat up his girlfriend in her head, she has to know that if her husband isn't there or some know maybe her husband isn't there. I don't know who her husband is. Her husband might be kind of a pussy. You might fold under pressure. I mean you might run into a situation where it's chris brown and you and then what do you do? What do you do then? What are you going to. If I would have to be so stone to like get to that place now, it'd be like, fuck man. If I ever ran into. I hope I don't get attacked by chris brown. I got you. You get in an argument with them on twitter back and forth and saying chris brown paint while you're not arguing with them on twitter where you're a woman and he wants to kick your ass. I'm not saying he wanted to kick her ass, but I'm saying if you know a man is or a beat up a woman and then she is now locked in online in this like verbal insult battle back and forth. He's saying he's going to fart in her and he's

Speaker 3:          02:19:28       saying he's gonna. Uh, yeah. I said he's gonna like jerk off on her and foreigner mouth and stuff like crazy shit. And you know, to be a chick that's got to be a little fucking weird. Right. What about the black keys drummer and justin bieber? Yeah. Yeah. Patrick carney did a thing where he said something like, justin bieber doesn't deserve an emmy or something along those lines, and the bieber fans went after him so he just starts retweet and all of their stuff with like hilarious answer's always the best. It was really fucking sticking up for bieber are hilarious. But he turned himself into bieber. He made his photo, bieber and change his name to justin bieber and then with legs, right? And swag and all this different shit to people. Like they would insult him and he would write swag. Stop trying to pretend to be beaver. You not be with. You're a fucking loser. Swag swag is such a great word to just say like that. Swag, like especially if you're in a battle with justin bieber's fans, if you just say swag, it like seeing that

Speaker 4:          02:20:33       the bieber army, they attack a course, so does the Brittany Spears army. Neil hamburger a stirs them up every once in a while where he was getting attack for a long time by britain. Brittany

Speaker 3:          02:20:44       beers. Remember that video with that guy screaming. Leave brittany alone. Yes. That was amazing. That video is one of my all time favorite youtube videos. The guy's lying on his bed. He's gay or than a mansion filled with dicks and he's just leaving, just crying with his hair, flopping behind him on the pillow. It's just, it's wonderful. He's can't even get out of bed when he's making this. He's so gay. He's like drawn to the bed, like a piece of metal to a giant magnet. He's just drawn to a bad luck. It can't even get up. She's just crying, looking into his camera. Cringe city at woman we were talking about earlier actually killed herself. Duncan, the woman's orgasm woman. Hmm. Wow. Betrayed by her body. She lives in agony. Not ecstasy. Warning, sexual subject matter. Get your dick out, boys. It's just her moaning for bad.
