Speaker 1:          00:00:01       Five, four, three, two, one. Boom, boom. Adam, what's up man? How you doing? It's good to be here today. It's good to be here too with you and to talk knocking shit over there. Can't be trusted. Your book. Alien worlds and the fate of the earth. All about it. That's deep shit, man. Just the, just the title alone. Like, whoa. I love aliens. Everybody loves aliens. Everybody does. But what are your thoughts on actual aliens and whether or not they've ever visited here? Yeah, it's interesting because uh, you know, sorta two things. So first of all we should tell everybody you have a background in science. I do. I'm an astrophysicist at the University of Rochester. I run a research group that studies like stars and planets. And so you're not a crazy person I brought on here. No, no, no. I'm a card carrying scientists. I got my card and everything.

Speaker 1:          00:00:58       Um, so yeah, I've been doing research on astronomy, astrophysics for a long time, but I also do all this popular writing like for Npr, New York Times. And the genesis of this book came a because I love science fiction. Been reading science fiction since I was a kid, uh, but also I do a lot of work on climate change and so I do a lot of climate change denial. And what I realized was that there's this way we talk about it that is like completely forgets about the fact that like, we're probably not the first, you know, and uh, that led me to a whole bunch of research that eventually led to this book, you know, including one paper that we did that showed that the odds that we're the only time it's ever happened, only you know, the only civilization in the entire history of the universe.

Speaker 1:          00:01:36       The only way that that could be true is if, uh, the odds per planet are one in 10 billion trillion, right? That's pretty low, right? So, you know, the, you know, the odds of anything being one in 10 billion trillion at pretty freaking low. So, um, it's probably happened before, you know, there's been other civilizations before ours. And once you realize that man that is like, you know, changes everything about how we think about ourselves, you know, and what's happening to us right now. So other civilizations before ours that have fucked things up. Well that's kind of the premise, right? So that's what, you know, when you look at climate change, right? Basically what we it is, is civilizations are giant machines for turning energy into work, right? You know, New York City, right? You sit over and you look at Manhattan, you're like, Holy Shit, there's all this energy flowing into it.

Speaker 1:          00:02:23       And then there's all this work being done, you know, to keep everything moving. And uh, you know, there's no way not to have an impact if you build a world girdling civilization, which, you know, that's what a civilization is. There's going to be impact. So the whole point of my doing this book was to start looking at ourselves as just one of, you know, we're not alone, right? The only time this has ever happened doesn't mean anybody's around now, like that's a different question. But the idea that like, it's never happened before. It meaning like, you know, you know, civilization what's happening around us, like these machinery and everything that um, you know, that just in the new world of what we understand about planets and shit that is just like, you know, it's not tenable anymore. We got to wake up the idea that some civilization has to be the first one.

Speaker 1:          00:03:05       That's the only. The only way you could ever think that we're the only ones is that some civilization has to be the first one. Even in a universe that's infinite. Yeah, it has to happen one time. But the ideas are the conditions ideal in a trillion different spots all over the, the infinite spanse of the universe. And that's the thing, right? So what we've learned, so you know, one of my trips right now is like, this is not your grandfather's steady anymore, right? Our understanding, we went through this major revolution in our understanding of what planets about 20 years ago. So he looked back at the Greeks, right? And you can see them arguing about when he were there. Any other stars have planets other than the sun. And you know, it goes back and forth, you know, some of the Greeks were like, yeah, it's definitely happening.

Speaker 1:          00:03:49       And then like, aristotle was like, no, we're the only world in this whole, in the whole universe that has life. And then as time goes on, it kind of goes back and forth. And even at the turn of the last of this, uh, the 19th century, people thought planets were incredibly rare that like, they all, they thought the only way you can get a planet with two stars past really close to each other and they kind of like taffy pulled out stuff that will eventually form a planet. And the lots of those kinds of collisions are so small that people were like, you know what, there's just no planets and no plan. It's no life, you know, unless something really freaky is going on. But then 20 years ago we discovered our first planet orbiting that crazy. When you really think about that, 20 years is such a short amount of time.

Speaker 1:          00:04:24       Nineteen 98. Yeah. Yeah. And nobody knew before that, like nobody knew whether there were any planets. Right. You know, when I was starting to drive, people are like, well, we don't know whether there's going to be any other planets, and we went from a to z. The first one was actually 96, I think [inaudible] 95, 96. Uh, from that to now where we know that every fricking star in the sky had the planet at least one, you know, pretty much everyone pretty. I mean, the big giant ones, maybe not, but they're so rare that you know, pretty much every star you see in the sky has a family of planets around it. That is so nuts. It's so nice that this is such a new discovery. Yeah. I mean, when we think about what we know about the universe, we think that we've had a pretty good understanding of it for a long time.

Speaker 1:          00:05:03       Right. But the fact that we didn't even know for sure that there are planets, right? Right. In my own lifetime, you know, people were teaching me when I was starting, you know, we just don't know. Maybe they're rare and now we know for certain that they're everywhere. And I think people have to realize is every one of those planets is a place, you know what I mean? It's a place you could walk around, some of them for sure are going to have oceans, there's going to be mountains, it's going to be rain falling, you know, I mean like they're all freaking places and they're all places where things can happen. You know, planets are basically like nature's way of taking sunlight and doing something interesting with it. So you have 10 billion trillion planets in the universe, right? And every one of them is an experiment that's being run.

Speaker 1:          00:05:42       So you know, the idea that like, we're the first time it's out now that we know that right now that we've gone through that revolution and understand that planets are like, diamond doesn't planets. Now we're not only talking about planetary, we're talking what plants are in the right place for life to form. So there's the idea of the habitable zone, right? So, you know, mercury sucks. You cannot, you know, mercury so hot that there no way anything's going to happen. And you know, planets that are far, far enough out there going to be so cold, you know, they're so far away from their star that they're gonna be so cold that, you know, it's hard to get liquid water on the surface. So we defined the habitable or goldilocks zone is the place where you can have, you can pour water onto the surface and they'll just sit there and will freeze and it will sort of just evaporate away.

Speaker 1:          00:06:19       So, uh, all these 10 billion trillion planets I'm talking about are all in the right place for life to form, you know. And so like with that many numbers that many experiments being run, like you got to be a psychotic pessimists to say that like this is the only time a civilization has ever happened. Right? But there's still no evidence yet. Obviously we didn't even know that they're really absolutely were planets until 20 years ago. Right. But we don't know for sure that there's something else out there. No, no. This is an argument by a, I call it like an argument by exhaustion. You know, if I gave you a bag of 10 billion trillion planets and you have to sort through all of them, right? The odds that you're gonna you're never gonna find another one that, that built a civilization is now, you know, like I said, you're really asking for really serious pessimism, but you know, we're just getting started with this game, right, of looking for life.

Speaker 1:          00:07:05       That's why I keep saying it's not, this is not your grandfather's said where you're like you're pointing, you know, a radio telescope at a star and you kind of wait to see whether somebody signal signaling you who knows whether they are signaling who knows what they'd be using. Now, what we can do, because we got all these planets to stare at his, you know, we're going to be able to like stare at them as they pass in front of their star and get the light that passes through their atmosphere. So we're going to like, who knows what we're going to find, you know, we're not waiting for them to signal us anymore over the next. I swear to God, man, in the next 30 years we're going to have data relevant to the question of life, maybe not civilization, so that could happen too, but just life on other worlds, you know, and we've never had that for all the arguments for the entire history of humanity have just been two dudes yelling at each other.

Speaker 1:          00:07:44       Right? But in the next 30 years because the stuff we're building and now that we know there's, there's, uh, uh, planets, we're going to have real data to argue over with. So now it's like this is where we're in a whole nother ballgame. Now. I think the big fear for a lot of people is what happens when we find out for sure that there's something else out there. If we really do find like some other Manhattan on some goldilocks planet, yeah, it's hovering some similarly sized star, a billion light years away or whatever the hell it is, that's going to be very, very, very strange. It will be, it'll be a game changer, right? Because for religions, for, you know, I mean, wow, you know, what do you do if you find other intelligent creatures were building civilization, started making them pay taxes. That's what you do.

Speaker 1:          00:08:26       You Go, you know, get pissed off that they're not doing what you want them to do. You should be believing this bunk, you know, so, uh, but I think, you know, for me the thing is like it's about climate change because what it means is like there's no way. But from my perspective, you know, that, that if you have a civilization, you push your planet, you can't stop it in some sense of your build a civilization. It's, well the only way around that is if you have like a subsistence culture, indigenous native American culture, right? Which it seems impossible, but it existed here 200 years ago, which is a blink of an eye. I know. It's amazing. It's only 200 years since the ramp up your that the world population only crossed up the billion mark and like 1850, you know, I mean there were so few of us on the planet for most of the time that you've been.

Speaker 1:          00:09:14       We've been around. Forget the planet's history. Uh, so, you know, I think like there is no discovery if we were to get any evidence you don't want to. I think the way it's going to happen is going to be more by accident than by like signaling, you know, like the. So, so, but if we had any evidence of another technological forget any evidence of just life, right? If we just find a biosphere evidence that, you know, and we can do that from a distance, right? I, even, if the star is, you know, 30 light years away, if we get, if we see as the light passes through the star's atmosphere for those few moments, if we see oxygen in the atmosphere, you know, will be able to attack that. That's what we can do with telescopes. We can tell like what you can see the fingerprints of the different kinds of elements.

Speaker 1:          00:09:51       If we see oxygen in the atmosphere, you know, and methane that pretty much says that there's a biosphere there, that there's life because you wouldn't get oxygen, would just react away really fast if it wasn't for life like in our, on, uh, on earth. It wasn't for life. There'd be no oxygen in the atmosphere. What are the possibilities of life that exists in a completely different environment than we expect. Like I know that they found life at the bottom of the ocean is volcanic events at extreme heats, boiling water that didn't expect to see this. And this is fairly recent as well. That is that. Yeah, the idea that the. Because right. This whole definition of the habitable zone was based on the idea like, oh, you got to have a surface and it's got to be, you know, but now with the, every, not every but like a bunch of the moons orbiting Jupiter and Saturn, the gas giants, they have oceans under them.

Speaker 1:          00:10:35       Like, well, this thoughts that you rope up might have something below the surface, right? Yeah. Yeah. Because the Europa is a pretty big moon and we know it's covered in ice, right? You can see it's covered in it, you know, and we think that layer of ice is maybe like, I don't know, 10 kilometers thick and then below that there may be 100 kilometers of ocean and because as it moves around Jupiter, it's con the gravity of Jupiter. So squishing the insights at this probably volcanic activity happening at the surface. So you have hydrothermal vents, you know, heat escaping out of then chemicals escaping out of the surface under the ocean. And that's how we think life form on earth. That's one of the arguments for how life forms from formed first in the hydrothermal vents. So yeah, it's a new day. That's another game changer, right?

Speaker 1:          00:11:13       So that we should also be thinking not just about the, the classic, uh, the habitable zone, but now we've got to think about like life and can you get civilizations in an underwater civilization? You know, in an underwater you, maybe you have a really rich ecosystem, but you know, with the problem with a, uh, you know, an underwater life or forming civilization is that you can't really do fire. Right. Fire was pretty important for us. For metallurgy, you know, to build advanced technology, you kind of need combustion. So, you know, that's kind of the open question with that. Yeah. We're not really concerned with animals. We're concerned with things that think and change their environment. There isn't that weird. Like we are concerned with life, but we're only concerned with life that's it least similar or comparable to us. Microbes don't like. We don't. Yeah, we don't that I'm going to go to Jupiter for some microbes, but we are excited about the things that they've recently found on Mars.

Speaker 1:          00:12:01       Right. I mean there's a very recent discovery, right? Yeah. So, you know, the thing is actually from the, you know, so I'm gonna I, I worked in a lot of fields, but I would also consider myself an astrobiologist. Right. Which is a pretty kind of a wild idea that you can do astrobiology even though you only have one example, which is the earth, but we've learned so much and now we can start asking ourselves about the possibility of life elsewhere. So finding even a microbe like even a frigging, you know, Amoeba on Mars would be, or even evidence that there used to be a, but what is the evidence that they've discovered on Mars? What they found was um, organic chemistry, right? And so our better organic chemistry man, I hated chemistry when I was growing up and I hated, or was that just basically chemistry involved in carbon, you know, so you can have non or organic chemistry doesn't mean organisms, but it's the kind of chemistry that organisms live.

Speaker 1:          00:12:48       Right? So finding evidence that there was like they drilled nice and we sent a freaking robot cars that could drill through a rock, you know, and then ingest the rocket and then send the data back. Cross space. We're pretty good for a bunch of hairless apes. Um, so what, what they found was evidence for fairly complex. Um, uh, you know, uh, organic chemistry, which meant that way back when Mars and this, we know for sure, right? Mars had water on it. We know that for sure now Mars was a blue planet for Mars was hit by an asteroid or comet or something along those lines. Everything got hit by comments. That's how we have, you know, we have chunks of Mars here, right? That, you know, the thing in [inaudible] 96 or whatever, when they were like, ah, we found life on Mars, you know, they thought that what they found was a fossil bacteria in a chunk of Mars that they found in Antarctica.

Speaker 1:          00:13:35       So the planets have been swapping spit for like the entire history of the solar systems, fossilized bacteria that they found. Is that been confirmed that most people now think that the Allen hills a meteorite, that probably, you know, it's inconclusive, but it's not conclusive enough to be like, yeah, we found life. It's like a tiny little squiggly worm. Look, that's what it was. Yeah. But it was so small that it was like waist smaller than any of the microscopic fossilized bacteria we've ever seen before. So people in general are like me. Um, but by fine. But that's what started, right. That's when Clinton was like, okay, we're going to send a lot of shit to Mars because after I went back in [inaudible] 90 [inaudible], early nineties, people were kind of done with Mars. And so that's what triggered the whole, you know, one space probe after another, the rovers and like, so, you know, the thing we found was a direct result of that effort, which was this organic chemistry which says that back in the day Morris had had a lot of this stuff lying around, had a lot of these, you know, these, these organic chemicals line around which if your life, that's what you're going to be using.

Speaker 1:          00:14:28       So that's like one more step. Like we've been putting the Lego blocks for the argument for life on Mars one piece at a time since the. Since the first rovers went there. Yeah. If we did discover just even plants on some other planet, even just a planet with some sort of plant life, that would be, that'd be a game changer, game changer. Because right now we don't know if there's, we, you know, are we the only time in the entire history of the universe that like this crazy thing where you got, we went from non life to life. Like is that common or is that never ever, ever happened? So that's the question we want to. We want to answer. And I, you know, I mean, you know, that argument was given before is I think from the probable arguments. I'm saying it's like, you know, it's, it's almost overwhelming that you had probably happened somewhere.

Speaker 1:          00:15:13       Again, doesn't mean anything here, but we need evidence, right? Science. So we got to build that evidence. Yeah. And if we do find something, the, the, one of the weirder things would be if we found something and there was a way to get there. Yeah. You know, we, we find something and we're like, yeah, we find something, but it's, we're pretty sure there's some kind of life and its 3 billion light years away. Like, wow, that's cool. Yeah, what do we do? Yeah, it's nice to know that we're not the only ones. You know. It's interesting. Like how much would that change, you know, even if we found evidence for this, this is a debate, like if we found evidence of a technological civilization we saw like alien mega structures like that star, they felt that. What was that nonsense really nonsense. It was something floating around.

Speaker 1:          00:15:55       Right? So here's what they saw so that, you know, the way we discover planets is we look for when the planet passes in front of the star, you get a little dip in the light, right? It blocks out a little bit of light to the little eclipse. Um, and so, you know, we've now, that's how we know that every star in the sky has planets, but there is like they found one that just made no sense, like the light would dip. Then what stopped dip and then we'll begin three times and it stopped dripping. Sometimes it was lower, sometimes it was higher and you know, for a year. So people were like, fuck it, you know. And so, you know, um, uh, Jason Wright and others, Jason's a friend of mine, you know, they wrote a paper where they were like, hey, you know, at least because this is what the future's going gonna look like.

Speaker 1:          00:16:30       We can't say we can't. We have to at least consider the possibility that these are artificial structures that are orbiting the star or you know, have to be ungodly, huge, ungodly, huge alien mega structures. Like that's the best word for like the size of a country, right? Yeah, yeah. These things would be huge, right? But that's what people think. Like, you know, when people think about advanced alien civilization, the idea of building large scale structures is you think that maybe the next thing you do once you reach a certain point, like, um, you know, the dyson sphere, the idea that you could collect all of the sun's energy and use it for yourself by building a giant sphere around the sun with solar panels on the inside. People think like it goes back to Carter chefs, the idea of this Carter chef scale back in the sixties where he's like, look, there's going to be a natural progression of civilizations that goes first.

Speaker 1:          00:17:14       You collect all the energy you can from your planet and then you use that to do amazing things and then you collect all the energy from your star and then you do that, do amazing shit with that. And then, you know, the whole galaxy. So he, you know, Carter Chef thought there was a scale that civilizations naturally progress through. So hopefully you don't blow yourself up along the way. Well, I think that's the question. I mean, I've criticized the car chef scale in one of the papers I recently did because what it fails to take into account is the fact that like, you know, on your way up to the type one type one is when you harvest all the energy from your planet, which basically means somehow covering your planet in our solar panels or something that neglects what we've learned since Carter Chef wrote his paper in 64 is that, you know, planets don't like that shit.

Speaker 1:          00:17:53       Like planets. The plan's gonna feed back. You try and build, you know, massive shit on your planet. The planet has its own biosphere is pretty powerful and you've got to take the biosphere in the counter, you get climate change, you get the planet being pushed off in another direction. So, but whatever. So for the, um, for the alien mega structures, people thought like, well, maybe this is like a piece of it. Have a dyson sphere, right? This is like, you know, now. So, you know, when he proposed this, people went bonkers over this, right? He was just saying, he's like, look, here's the 15 different things. Could be, and I'm going to have to at least consider the possibility that it's artificial, um, but for me and some people got really angry everything, but I felt like this, they get angry because there's been a thing in the community over the years, you know, said he got a bad name, right.

Speaker 1:          00:18:32       Setting for a bunch of people. It was sort of thought as being like, oh, only whackadoodles do that and why? Why is that? Just because there was no results. I just think, you know, I, you know, it is, it's because of Shitty TV, you know, I mean, I really in some ways, right? It's all, you know, it's prosthetic foreheads, right? It's the whole. We've had so much kind of crappy, you know, speculation about aliens. I trying to do anything scientific. Always had this whiff of sort of being a little, you know. And then there's the Ufo stuff which is completely separate. It's nothing to do with it.

Speaker 2:          00:19:01       He said he never really achieved any results. Right. There was that one big blip that was highly popular items.

Speaker 1:          00:19:08       Wow. Signal. But here's the thing about setting, we never really did set that much, you know what I mean? Like people have this idea like, wow, we've got telescopes all over the world and they're looking, you know, so the government never funded a study study anything major, right. So people, you know, all that study has done is like basically, you know, some dudes on a telescope get a little extra time like, hey man, let's go look at a star. Right. So, um, Jill Tarter, who's one of the founders, one of the greats of Sadie, she compares it. It's like, you know, we've got an ocean that we need to look at and which. So far we've looked at a thimble, right. And she, the Jodie foster care, she's the jody foster character yet we're in contact with today. Yeah. Yeah. So she's laying on. It's a good point. Like we haven't really looked yet. So the idea that, you know, the stars are silent or anything, it's like man, come on. We haven't even begun to do a comprehensive.

Speaker 2:          00:19:54       Said he makes me sad. Why? Because I feel like they're wasting their time. And uh, there's a, there was a documentary I saw wants about some biologist who was convinced that the giant sloths was still alive and that there was examples of them in South America and this poor bastard had spent more than a decade looking for this giant sloths in South America. And there was, there was this moment where he was chasing down this suppose the dung pile and they were looking for and someone was there and he had this look in his eyes were like, he was like, Holy Shit, what if I wasted my fucking life in my academic career, chasing down something that's not even real. That's kind of how I've always felt about setting.

Speaker 1:          00:20:39       Yeah. But that's not the way the people. I mean, everybody was involved in it. Um, you know, I don't do steady, you know, I mean, you know, I respect that people are doing it. It's not. Yeah. But you know, most of them are like, look, this is just a multigenerational thing, you know? And if, even if I don't find it, I'm laying the foundation. It's like, you know, cathedrals, right? It took like how many generations does it take to build a cathedral in Medieval Europe? Right? So the first guy who laid the stone was like, I'm not going to see this, you know, maybe my great grandkids. So most of them were like, you know, they're, you know, they know that this is gonna, you know, this is a, this is a huge. It's like the most important question in humanity, right? Are we alone? And they're willing to accept that.

Speaker 1:          00:21:12       Like, you know, you're going to do it scientifically, you're going to have to do it brick by brick, you know, and so you just have to accept that and, you know, go on. So, uh, but like I said, I think we've, you know, this is a new era now. So the idea of like looking for signals, which assumes that somebody is putting out signals, right? That's, that's a huge assumption right there. But now that we know that there's all these planets and we're staring at all these planets, it's kind of, we need to be thinking differently about, you know, we need to be prepared for what happens when we see something we don't understand. Well, it's also, we don't even use radio anymore. Right? Right. Gabriel radio is dying slowly but surely. Yeah. Local radio is. I mean it's, it's kind of a thing of the past, right?

Speaker 1:          00:21:51       The only thing that's really were beaming out a large scale is a military radar. No, that's the main thing. So there'd be some kind of signal. It wouldn't necessarily have to be radar or, or radio just have to be something that we could detect some form of anomaly that seemed to be artificial. Right? So here's like, here's some of the suggestions that people are talking about. So Avi Loeb at Harvard talks about the idea, you know, maybe what you need and you're gonna need the sensitivity for this. You're going to see like rocket engines going back and forth between, you know, uh, you have a plan that you have to a multi planet civilization on, in some and you're going to see little flares is rockets, decelerate, accelerate back and forth. People have talked about seeing city lights, you know, the telescopes are getting, you know, we're, we're, we're building these giant telescopes there, like 30 meters and may be a potential one day to see city lights.

Speaker 1:          00:22:36       You could see city lights when you're going to see the planet come around. Like this is all like, you know, we're, we're not, we're not there yet, but people 20 years, 30 years, 30 years, 40 years, you know, this is a long game and you got to be playing the long game. At some point we're gonna need to build stuff in space that's even larger so we can collect more light. And multi issue will also be that if we do see these city lights, we're seeing city lights for millions of years ago. Well, it depends, like, you know, uh, planets that, that's a, an, a star 10 light years ago, that's 10 years ago. So it's not like, you know, these things could still be around. Okay, here's a really interesting idea, like, um, because, you know, one of the things that I'm talking about my book is like how long does any civilization last?

Speaker 1:          00:23:09       Right? That's the real question. All of this stuff is rest super relevant for us now because the question is what is the average lifetime of a civilization? So you might be able to see artifacts from civilizations that are gone, like imagine of civilization covered one of its moons in, in um, uh, solar panels, right? The reflected light is going to show a spectral signature of the, uh, the panels, you know, so it's like they don't even have to necessarily be alive now that we still might be able to see stuff from there, you know, are evidence of like artificial structures or something that's not natural around them. So, you know, that's the thing, man. It's like we're really, we're just, we're about to take this step in step in astrobiology we're, we're, you know, we're already running models. Have a Xcel biospheres, right? We're two.

Speaker 1:          00:23:53       We're asking like, oh, what kind of chemistry can you have if you don't like if you have a photosynthesis in s are on a planet around a star that's smaller than ours, that starts gonna be mostly red as opposed to yellow light. So the light that's coming off, it's going to be different. Kenya have photosynthesis in that case and people are like, yeah, you probably could. And what would it look like? So we're already doing the work to be ready for Expo biospheres. So exos civilizations, we kind of need to be prepared for that too. Looking for, you know, what, what could be the traces, what might we see from a distance from an eco civilization. They don't have to be signaling us, you know, they're just there and we're going to catch some aspect of their being around. Even if we did see rocket, if we did see some sort of a signature from rockets going back and forth, or the w, W, we would have to assume that this is a similarly aged civilization to hours.

Speaker 1:          00:24:40       Whereas if we saw something that was a thousand, 100,000 years advanced, we probably wouldn't see that anymore. We'll probably see some sort of a manipulation of time and space, if that's possible, if it's possible, if it's possible. Yeah. Yeah. So that's, I mean, of course that is one of the problems is that, um, when you start, you know, when you start pushing, it's just like saying like, you know, what is the, what are, what are we going to be like in a million years? You know, I mean, it's so long. So I think you start with what you know. And the, the cool thing about the planet part though is that, you know, unless they become like energy beings, you know, they're gonna have an effect on their planet. So looking at their planets to look for, you know, for spectral indications. That's probably even after they die, there might even be things, so that's, I think a, you know, a good way to go.

Speaker 1:          00:25:22       Yeah. I'm, you know, I'm so curious as to what we're going to be able to do in a thousand years, 10,000 years and 100,000 years. Civilization does Dale around and we figured out how to not melt the earth or boil the oceans or whatever. Whatever the ground we're doing. Yeah. Right. But there's, you know, a bunch of science fiction films that do speculated what, what's going to be possible in the future. And one of them was a, what was that recent one with? What's his name? All right. All right. What's his name? The fuck's his name? Mechanic. I'm the one where they go through the wormholes. Right. How much do those movies piss you off or they don't? I don't know. I, I do not mean but they get so of science fiction so, you know, I mean I do not need my science fiction to be correct to be correct.

Speaker 1:          00:26:09       I mean if they want to make, you know. So I love the expanse. The is my favorite show ever. I will talk about it. What is the expanse, the expanse I don't even know. Thank you. Help me. Um, so the expanse, it's a series of books, first of all that I think are the best science fiction books in the last 15 years. And then they made him into it and made it into a show, uh, on Saifai and then had three years of it. And you know, at first people were like, oh, this is kind of hard to follow because, you know, it's a lot of stories coming together. And then, um, you know, this year it got 100 percent, uh, uh, ratings or what is it? Rotten tomatoes, rotten tomatoes. A hundred percent or 95 percent if people love Scifi, cancelled it, you know. And so then Jeff Bezos just.

Speaker 1:          00:26:48       Yeah, Jeff, he just picked it up because people love this show. Fuck yeah, I'll tell you why this show is amazing, right? So, um, it takes place about 200 years from now and we are truly a multi planet species. Like Mars now has, you know, billion people on it and it's become its own political power, right? If it's separated from the earth. And then the asteroid belt has also, people are colonizing and you know, living on the asteroid belt to mind resources, but the belters as they call them, are like, they're like second class citizens who are basically like super poor and they're, you know, they've got the boot on their next by either earth or Mars. And so there's this whole interplanetary kind of political shit going on, which is just great, you know. Um, and then there's, you enter into this, they discover like the, what they call the protein molecule, like, you know, it was, this is basically this alien molecule that was really a device that some aliens through our way, billions of years ago that was, you know, how much am I supposed to give away, you know, I don't want it.

Speaker 1:          00:27:44       So. No, not too much. No one's going to remember. Right. Good, good. Uh, so that complicated so that, you know, that becomes kind of a weapon in this, this political intrigue. So it's just a great story to kind of, people call it like the game of thrones and space, but I'll tell you what I love about it is that this is what it's gonna look like, like they get the science on this show. So write as much as you can, right? So, you know, in space if your rocket motors are on, there's gravity because you know, the rocket motors push up towards you. And so yeah, you got grabbed, you can walk around when you turn the rocket motors off, you float around, right on spinning things, you know, anything. So, you know, in the, in, in this universe, you know, in this the fictional universe, they've taken the big asteroids and they followed them out and spun them up.

Speaker 1:          00:28:23       So people live on the inside, you know. And um, so at one point like the, that one of the characters that the private eye, they got this great sort of film noir thing going on and he pours a drink, some whiskey and the whiskey does this, spirals into this. So they got that, the Coriolis I peed my pants. I was like, oh my God, they got the coriolis effect. Right. So it's like, this is really what it's gonna look like, you know what I mean? This is if you want to imagine 200 years from now, which I think is completely feasible, that we have millions of people living in space making advances socially. Uh, no, no, no. People are assholes to each other. And that's what makes it. Yeah. It's only 200 years. That's a lot to ask for. Well, think about how different we are from people that live 50 years ago.

Speaker 1:          00:29:06       I mean, I don't want that different. I think we're quite a bit different. In what way? What do you think? Like, well, we have this ability to communicate now that we never did before where everybody has an ability to say their piece about how they feel about how things are going. Yeah. No, that's interesting. Right? And that has changed a lot of things a lot of ways, but I mean it has, it changed who we are. I mean, I think evolution, I think it's chipping away. Well that would be good if it, you know, because one of the things, my thing, so what's interesting about this fictional world too is that like climate, you know, the earth is dealing with client earth has like 30 billion people on it and you know, New York is halfway under water and so that's part of the story too, is that, you know, so we're trying to navigate our way through now becoming a multi planet species.

Speaker 1:          00:29:44       Um, so, you know, that is a version of at least 200 years where you can really extrapolate the technologies and ask yourself. Because that's real. I mean, I think that's really gonna happen. If we make it through climate change, that's the, that's the prize at the end of the, you know, uh, of the, of the story. If we make it through climate change, you know, what the stuff that Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos are doing, man, that's real like this. This is what your number one concern is. Climate Change. Michael. I'm a single voter. Yeah. Climate change because it's like it is an existential dilemma, you know, and because of all the writing I did for NPR and New York Times, I have dealt with a lot of climate change denialist men and it drives me what is their big, what's the big. Because I, I recently had a discussion with someone on the podcast that didn't believe in climate change and it was, it was a weird thing is because I kept pulling up all the different scientific consensus studies, all the different studies that show that we were having an impact.

Speaker 1:          00:30:33       It's an undeniable impact, undeniable. Thirty years of science. I know. I saw that and she was like, you know, that's what you say. I don't think that she's really thinking about the and the hurricane it was. I don't think she really thinks about it. I think she just has this stance that she believes that that group that she's a part of, that's what a subscribes to. So there's an ideological aspect of it where you kind of. You have a predetermined pattern that you're supposed to follow when you're on one side, you have to be pro life. You have to be pro second amendment stuff stuff. Yeah. And that's, I think it's a giant problem with our culture. There are two groups of people that you can't like to truly be an independent thinker. You're like one of these Weirdos. It's often the fringe to be independent of either party.

Speaker 1:          00:31:18       Right? Right. And the thing about science is the whole point of science is to be independent, is to be, and to have, you know, what science is, science is a way of having public knowledge. You know what I mean? Like everybody has their opinions, whatever. But science is about the stuff we can all be like, oh yeah, for sure. You know, it's this whole process that we've evolved over 400 years and with climate denial man, sometimes you know, it's just. Yeah, you want to be like, what? What are you saying man? Like what are, you know, read a book because they'll say stuff like, here's my favorite one. Oh, climate's always changing climate change in man, which is true. So if somebody comes to me, because you know what I want most for people I don't like, I consider myself an evangelist of science. I love science.

Speaker 1:          00:31:55       And so if people come to me they say, hey man, the climate always changing. I'm like, oh, great question. You know, we actually know the answer to that yet. It's changing but it's changing. What's the timescale, you know. So it changes often on million year time scales, but like from the last 10,000 years since the last ice age, which was 10,000 years ago, which is amazing. Like there used to be a mile of ice above our heads, you know, text 10,000 years ago, climate has been remarkably stable. Yeah. Has been little blips in it, but no major changes. Right? So, like, and I can show them the graph of this and everything. So if you're, if you know, if they're interested, you know, I mean if they're. So if they're asking the question because they want to know I'm, I'm all, I'm down to talk until the cows come home. But that's not what a typical deniers are. Deniers climate change. Well done. But they're not interested in the answer, but it isn't it. It's not only the not interested in the answer, they're just

Speaker 2:          00:32:40       trying to win. It's not a real conversation because it's a really complex thing. If you dig an ice core and you tap down to 50,000, $80,000 100,000 years, you see all these bizarre shifts of the climate that could be indicative of super volcanoes and asteroidal impacts and solar flares. A Lotta Shit happens over the course of a million years. Right? But to

Speaker 1:          00:33:07       hang all your

Speaker 2:          00:33:09       ideas on the party's ideology and to deny all this really interesting stuff and, and, and all these

Speaker 1:          00:33:18       variables. That's what, that's what pisses me off. It's like, you know what I try and tell people, it's like, look, climate science is like awesome. Like it's science. It's got these amazing stories to tell about, you know? Yeah. The earth earth over the past four point 5 billion years, the earth has gone through the most profound changes and we've learned about aren't you interested in that? But no. They basically have this thing where like, you know, I'm, I'm part of this group. And therefore have to have this opinion and I'm like, dude, it's science. Science doesn't care who you voted for. You know what I mean? Like the, the, a rated of properties of a co two molecule doesn't care whether you're wearing a blue tie or a red tie and the fact that people can't make that distinction. And here's the real problem. Once you go down this slippery road of denying, saying like, okay, that kind of science I hate man, they're all a hoax.

Speaker 1:          00:34:01       Well, you know, America's prosperity and our safety has been built on science over the last 200 years. You know, you start to erode the whole thing. You can't just like call one group of Geoscientists Hucksters, you know? And so they're only doing for learning and not have it slowly. In fact, everything else to the point where like, you know, China will be happy to eat our lunch when it comes scientifically. Chinese pumping, huge amounts of money into science. You're not doing this. So like, you know, we're, we're limiting. And here's the other thing that really bums me out. Science is not a, it's not a lunch buffet. You know what I mean? You can't be like, Oh man, can I have some of those antibiotics? I Love Antibiotics and Oh yeah, the cell phone's great. I'll use that. I really want to fly in a plane, but climate change is bullshit. You know? I mean like, you know, either you accept that you live in a scientific society. It doesn't mean like your slave actually adhere to anything. You know, it comes out in the journal it yesterday, but you know, either you adhere to the idea that this method has produced miracles for us or you don't give me the cell phone back. Well, the terrific

Speaker 2:          00:34:54       method is what has established the actual real facts of how things interact with each other. That it's allowed us to create technology and I think they, they, they split that distinction. They focus on the technology and commerce, which is more important than their eyes. Then the, the, the, the consequences of the environment or what's going to happen to the environment. Yeah. There's the big hope is that we're going to figure it out and I'm hopeful of that too, is that we're going to figure out some way to extract carbon from the atmosphere with devices or some enormous, like there was, I don't know if it was a working prototype or is just a concept, but there was an enormous building that was really an air filter. The other starting to look

Speaker 3:          00:35:38       at carbon capture again with places like Hong Kong and places where they have terrible Beijing and they have terrible, terrible pollution and more importantly particulates in the atmosphere. So it's not just a a like a carbon thing. It's like they have shit in there air that they're breathing in your lungs. Awful. It's, you know, I went to Mexico City a couple years back. I've been there twice, but I went there for a UFC and when we were flying in, I took photos and I put them on my instagram. So you find those. They're fucking shocking. Unbelievable. Right? What kind of a creepy animal is the human? The human is capable of burning smoke into the very air that we need to take into the lungs to keep our body a lot. Oh, you see it so bad. People have never been to Mexico City. Like it's a stunner, dude. My fucking head was killing me after two days there. Yeah, well that's what like with the Beijing, when they had the Olympics, right, they had to like, you know, they had to stop all industrial activity, but like the month, right? La used to look like this right before the clean air act, la would have, that's what I wrote. I wrote Mexico's La on steroids. Mexico City's early on steroids. It's just so dark,

Speaker 1:          00:36:44       you know, the, uh, this whole question of what we'll do, like this brings us back to the aliens, right? What's my, my point is, is that, you know, we're not the first time this has happened. It pretty much if you build the civilization, anybody who builds the civilization like we've done is going to trigger climate change. Right? It's like it's kind of unavoidable. Right? So that's, it goes back to the denier thing. And one of the things I'm trying to do is flip the script, right, because you talked to climate denialists and it's the same fricking set of things that like, you know, man Dude, we've been here before. We, the questions will be answered, but I'm trying to like flip it to show that like the whole question of did we change the climate? That's why everybody focused on did we, did we not, you know, and you know from when you take the 10,000 light your view, then what you realize is like, what did you expect?

Speaker 1:          00:37:24       Like we built a world girdling civilization that uses a quarter almost of all the energy the biosphere uses, right? So you know, every, you know, every day the biosphere has like, you know, 200 terawatts of energy that it's producing and sugars we use about a quarter of that. Like how did you expect there wasn't going to be an impact, right? So this changes the whole way we look at. We don't need to argue about like, did we or didn't we? Of course we did. This is what happens when you reach this level. And the other thing that, you know, in the book that I'm trying to argue to also, and it pushes back against the deniers, is like what climate deniers are human haters, you know, they're all like, you know, we did this amazing thing. We changed the atmosphere of an entire planet, right? Climate change shows on one level how fricking awesome we are.

Speaker 1:          00:38:05       You know, how far we've gotten and this, if you look at the, you know, from the perspective of, you know, species doing this again and again across the universe, this shows that we've reached a level, right? We have, we've leveled up, right? You don't play a lot of video games, right? And so that whole thing when you level up and you know, you get the, the sniper rifle, we've leveled up. And so now the question is, are we smart enough, you know, to see what we've done and make the right choices because that's what the universe is going to be. There's going to be species that trigger climate change is gonna happen all the time. And some are going to be like, Oh man, we need to do something right. And they'll make the actions, they'll be able to work it out, get it together, and other ones, you know, which is going to end up in the cosmic waste pile.

Speaker 1:          00:38:39       So we're like cosmic teenagers and just like when you're a teenager and you're, you know, uh, you get, you start to drive, right? Either you figure it out, you know, either you're drinking and you're partying and drive the car off a cliff or you figure out how to handle your responsibility. And that's us now, you know. Yeah, no, I agree with you. And, uh, I, I feel like there's a fundamental, fundamental problem with the way people approach ideas and uh, I think it goes back to what we're talking about earlier about right versus left or you know, Republican versus Democrat, they're not thinking of the consequences of arguing for, against the possibility that climate change is a human caused thing. They're not thinking of the consequences. They just want to win. Right, right. And what their side to be, right want their site to be.

Speaker 1:          00:39:17       Right. And that, you know, what, what bums me out is they don't understand the consequences of that for the both the American enterprise and the human enterprise, right? I mean, because, you know, uh, if you, if you keep calling one branch of science a hoax, then what's to say the other branches, like what, you know, then you just, you're down, you're rolling down this slippery slope where like the other countries you don't like. So most of the, of the, um, Nobel prizes Americans have one where people from other countries, they came here to do their science because we had the best scientific enterprise. The next generation will just go somewhere else. They'll go to China, you know. So, um, there's that part of it. And the other part it's like, dude, it's just science. It doesn't care about your political views and you know, it's not fair to use the cell phone and take the antibiotics and then turn around and like, and then suddenly treat this thing as if it was another thing in your bucket of ideologies.

Speaker 1:          00:40:08       I think also people think if you somehow or another compromise industry's ability to work, that you're going to kill jobs and you're gonna damage the economy and that's more important. Yeah. But I think it's the exact opposite. Right? And if people really saw, right, I mean, um, you know, again, just like I'm saying, climate change shows how powerful people become. It also shows how powerful are our enterprise. Right? We did this by, you know, building businesses by building enterprise bi and we built this world girdling machine of civilization and it, you know, the planet actually noticed. Why do you like that term world girdling because that's, it gives me the hurdle of wrapping around think it's because it's from like a Shakespeare, like from a Caesar or something. I always thought it wasn't good, but it's the idea that like, you know, the foundation trilogy, the Isaac Yasmin Off, you know, classic science fiction thing, that there's the city of the planet of trend toward which is the center of the, uh, the empire, the Galactic Empire.

Speaker 1:          00:41:04       And it's, you know, it's basically the whole planet has been covered in city. You know, like the other planet, you got to go down to like 500 levels before you get to the surface. So that idea, you know, what I like about it is the idea that like, you know, we've done something, we're kind of covered the planet in our, our effect, you know, covered the planet in our enterprise. So this issue of business is that like, um, there's a place I can stand in Rochester, I did this for MPR and there's the Erie Canal. I can stand right on the edge of the Erie Canal. Then there's a train tracks, you know, the tracks was laid, the tracks laid back and you know, the original line back in the 18, whatever seventies. Then there's a highway and then there's the airport right over there for different infrastructures, you know, which he took huge amounts of money to build what of which we don't even use anymore.

Speaker 1:          00:41:46       Right? So the idea of building on an infrastructure that will, that will not be carbon polluting, will not trigger climate change. Like did, this is what we do. So the idea that there's going to be more jobs that come out of this than it could ever come out of fossil fuels, you know, it's not a big deal for human beings because that's what we do to switch infrastructures and there will be a lot of wealth generated by, you know, just like there was, you know, when we switched to the trains, you know, where's the argument coming that we. Because there are people that just adopt the party line, the party line that human climate's always changed and human beings barely affected. And it's not something to concentrate on. Where's that coming from? Again, I think it's the, you know, the gradual political polo polarization of everything, you know, because you look at, in the, um, we're now at the, what is it 30 year anniversary of Jim Hansen, who was the famous climate scientist giving his testimony in front of Congress in 1988 a hot, sweltering summer day.

Speaker 1:          00:42:41       We said climate change is already happening, you know, and that made news everywhere. And that was the first public awakening that this was happening. And if you look at the first Bush administration, they were like, oh yeah, we're ready to do something about this year. We can do it, you know? Um, and then it just gradually over time, as the whole political polarization thing happened, you can actually see the, uh, the very purposeful denial, right? They took a page out of the cigarette companies for years, right? Cigarettes were like, cigarette companies are like, no, it's not a problem. So they were purposefully, the other people had money invested. Right. You know, this is a documentary that, that goes into that. What is the name of that merchants of doubt, merchants of doubt. It's a great book, man. That's a really good book. And the documentary is really good.

Speaker 1:          00:43:23       It was purposeful. You know, it's, that's also confusing. It's like, why are they doing that? Like who's paying them to do that? Obviously the cigarette companies wouldn't be paying the same people to put doubt into the idea that cigarettes are addictive or cigarettes caused cancer. And this is what had been done in the past. You know, the same people are involved in doing it with climate change. But why? Uh, well, you know, one time I wrote a piece for the NPR that was kind of positive about like, yeah, we can switch infrastructure like I'm saying. And some guy wrote me back very angry and he said, you know, the proven reserves, you know, the stuff, the oil that's in the ground has a wealth, has a monetary value, like, you know, that's in there in the oil companies, banks, you know, the, in their bank accounts of one point $5,000,000,000,000.

Speaker 1:          00:44:06       And like I said, dude, you know, people have gone to war for a lot less than one point $5,000,000,000,000, right? So, you know, if, if we were to really be like, hey man, we can't burn that, you know, you're gonna have to leave that in the ground. That's likely their bank accounts. But I'm like zero pretty fast. So what I don't. So it's those industries. I think that's part of it. And then it gets, you get linked to other things and then it becomes this sort of like mass, uh, you know, becomes the political poll. They use political polarization to sort of, you know, sort of make this happen. It doesn't feel like other countries aren't doing this. Right. That's the important thing. You know, other countries. There's always a little bit of climate denial going on, but we're the only country that's got, as you can see, because we're the only ones who are not part of the Paris accord. Well, it's one of the

Speaker 2:          00:44:45       weirdest things about this right left things. The left is always supporting the environment. The left is all about the environment. The left is about clean air and

Speaker 1:          00:44:53       yeah. Water. How did that happen? I don't understand. I don't understand that either. The whole thing is very strange. Well, I got, you know, I mean, I have issues with environmental lists too because, um, I think one of your shows I was watching, you know, the whole idea of Eco Bros, right? And you get ECO Brode, but people, and I noticed I have a piece in the New York Times today, an op ed where I'm basically saying like, look man, the planet's going to be fine. Like, you know, long term. There's nothing we can throw at the biosphere that is going to kill it. We're in. It's not about saving the planet, the Earth. He's not a fuzzy little bunny, you know, the planet is powerful and it's really about saving us. Let's be honest about what's going on and is going to be all kinds of ethical choices that go on that, you know, the polar bears may not be able to come along with us on the ride here. You know, we need a healthy biosphere with, you know, a lot of biodiversity, but you know, we're part of it and we're going to have an impact. There's no such thing as no impact and you know, already I'm getting ECO brode people, you know, you don't care about life. I just like, oh, come on man. I just put it in the thing. I said we need to be wise and compassionate, you know, but they're like, no, people have

Speaker 2:          00:45:49       convening opinions. I mean this is, this is one of the things you get involved with when you start talking with people about really important issues. I mean, it's like we were talking about earlier, they want to be right and they want to be on the sides. It's righteous and with virtue in ethics, right, they find anything that you disagree, that they disagree with it. You're saying they don't ask you questions, they don't go. What do you think the implications are? Like how do you, how do we minimize the effects and the negative consequences of are they just immediately want to say you are insensitive. You are an asshole. You are the problem. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:46:26       You didn't know my way around that and that's what the whole book is about is to like when you've got a polarization, right? You know, where you're either this or you're that. The thing that this is like a mathematical idea is to go orthogonal. You know when you, when you go, because you know it's a line basically, right? You're either on this side or that side go 90 degrees to it. Now you're in a whole new space. Now you're up and down to the left and. Right. Exactly. And now like the questions that. So you see this in like revolutions in science, right? So you look at Einstein and what happened when Einstein came up with a relativity, everybody at the time was like, you know, um, they were all concerned what they call the luminaire forest, ether, you know, light needed, like to wave and everybody thought it needed something to propagate through, right radio way or, um, waterways go through water, sound, wave go through air.

Speaker 1:          00:47:06       So the whole thing was about this ether. The Luminous Air Easter is, this exist, does not exist, but I'm not. One time I was like, you know, I'm not really interested in that problem. Am I going to do it? He just changed the whole thing and you just said, look, here's two new ideas. They have nothing to do with the luminous every either. And like all the old questions, all the old battles kind of just fell away and they didn't even make sense anymore. So that's what I'm trying to do in the book and say, look, when you look at climate change as a planetary transition, a predictable planetary transition, the whole idea of environmentalism versus business interests. And, uh, you know, right, Republicans versus Democrats, it just doesn't, you know, it's not even relevant anymore. What matters is that this is going to happen. We should have expected it to happen.

Speaker 1:          00:47:46       And now the question is, do we become a cosmic winter or cosmic loser? And we have to think about the biosphere differently. We have to think about our place in the biosphere differently and the old arguments. So that's what, you know sometimes with climate change deniers, I'll throw this stuff at them and it's really kind of fun to watch and be like, because you're expecting me to say like a, B and c and they've got d, e and F and response and I throw this stuff out them and they're just like, no, I'm not doing it. Just a fight with climate change. But I think it's true. But.

Speaker 2:          00:48:10       Well, who was it that was on the podcast? It was talking about climate stabilization techniques and that this is probably the future. Was it boy? Um, anyway, what people are really worried about when, when you talk to people that understand the history of the human race and the history of the earth is climate cooling. I think the climate cooling is far more terrifying than climate warming because if we go into a giant ice age, again, I mean way more people are gonna die a terrible loss of resources and it can be devastating to the human race that is. Is that, is that something that you agree with?

Speaker 1:          00:48:46       Yeah, no, I don't think so. I mean it's true. And here's something interesting. We're kind of overdue for an ice age.

Speaker 2:          00:48:52       Yeah, well that was the thing in the seventies there were saying that we're in the verge of.

Speaker 1:          00:48:56       Yeah, I mean that there was just a couple of guys, I mean that whole thing because that's often something that climate deniers will throw at you in the seventies, you know, it was like, there was like one or two guys who said that and then it got picked up on the news, but the climate community at that time was not like, oh my God, it's cooling. Right? But here's the interesting thing for me and at the fits into this whole idea is that like we're holding off an ice age, like there may never be. If human humanity is successful and we navigate the Anthropocene, you know, that term the anthropocene that we've now entered, we've now entered the human dominated era. We've been for the last 10,000 years. The geological epoch has been what they called the Holocene. That's all of human civilization happened in the whole scene.

Speaker 1:          00:49:29       You know, it's pretty warm. It's pretty wet, moist, you know, everything's not locked up in ice and it's an inter glacial period. And if we weren't around, yeah, and another thousand, 3000, 500 years would be another ice age. But the anthropocene that were triggering could hold off ice ages forever, right? As long as we're around, there won't be another ice age because we've already added enough warmth to the planet that it overcomes the effects that trigger an ice age. So like what are the ethical responsibilities of that? That's what I try and tell the, you know, the environmentalists like, you know, you've got this image like oh we got to save the earth, but they're thinking of like the whole scene and it's like, well, you know, the planet even with us, even if we successfully keep biodiversity rich and it's not going to be the earth we started with, you know, because we're here. So yeah. What about the species that never form because we held off the ice age. No, I mean forever. Like what about the ethical responsibility though? So like it opens for. That is a long equation though, isn't it? Uh, in what way?

Speaker 2:          00:50:25       Try to contemplate what would have existed

Speaker 1:          00:50:28       if we allow the earth to cool and our responsibility for allowing the earth to cool so that the potential for new species to advance. It's like fuck those pieces. Let's keep, let's keep this place warm so we can stay alive. Well, all I'm saying, the only reason I'm raising that I'm not, you know, I'm raising that because we don't. When we talk about climate change, what you get sometimes when the environmental movement is this sort of like the polar bear, the polar bear. It's like what I'm trying to say, look, I love polar bears. Kind of funny that polar bears always think because polar bears will rip your head off and drink your. And not only that, then one of the rare bears, it doesn't need anything but me. Yeah, right. Right. And so it's so funny that we're like, oh, Kevin is a biologist, and he said like, when you get polar bear babies, like right out of the womb, you said they're like the, like the alien from the chest, chest burster steam.

Speaker 1:          00:51:13       He said that literally like right out of the womb, they're looking to kill and eat. You're like, oh, you're so good. That is a fucking. Obviously people have tamed them and Fed them to the point where they don't in your head off. Yeah. But that's a fucking predatory enormous animal. Yeah. So I'm, I'm raising that point to say like, look, the thing we're going through now is a, it's an epic making planetary transition. We were part of it, right? And whether or not we're still part, that's the question whether or not we're still part of it a thousand years from now, you know, is the big issue. So, you know, there are ethical issues about the polar bear, right? But there are also ethical issue. We can't just return the earth to some pristine state. We're here, there's 7 billion of us, you know, so you have to, we're going to have to understand like there's this deeper ethical question about what is an earth look like that's been changed by us that's healthy but still has us on it.

Speaker 1:          00:52:06       It may not have polar bears, you know, it may have rich phyto plankton, you know, uh, and it may be a very species diverse, but some of the species may not come with us. So like we can't this sort of like things like, oh, the pristine or if there is no more pristine earth, we, you know, we've been changing the earth since we were here. So it's like how do we have a healthy, a rich, healthy biosphere with us and our civilization still in it. And the thing about things that have gone extinct in the past and more than 90 percent of everything that's ever existed is extinct. Problem is we didn't know then. Right? We didn't have a, you know, a checklist like, oh, spotted owl, check. Got It. No tree frog. Check. Got It. Now we do. And when one goes away we kind of freak out.

Speaker 1:          00:52:50       Yeah. And that's, you know, I mean, you know, we have to have compassion for life because we're part of it without the compassion, you know, we end up with a, as a Gavin Schmidt, a friend of mine calls economic. We have ecological hooliganism, right? We just do crazy. We're just dumping Shit into rivers. Like, yeah, you don't have to do that man. Um, but, you know, when in my talks on this, I'll show like the polar bear, the lonely polar bear on the island and you know, like all you have once really bummed out about this. And then I'll show like a velociraptor, right? You know who's crying for the velociraptor species come and go. So we have to, you know, and the earth goes to these huge transitions. I'm not saying be like don't care about those species, but you got to have bigger picture with us in it.

Speaker 1:          00:53:27       Here's the problem with the, with the, uh, the environmental movements. You know what though? Sometimes the, it gets framed. It's not just the environment in which the way we talk about climate change, we think of ourselves as being a plague, right? A human beings, we suck, right? That's the basic. That's the only story. You, we have two stories. It's not happening or we suck. And my whole thing is like, that is the raw. Not only is that story wrong, it's unhelpful. You know, we are what the biosphere is doing now. You know, millions of years ago it was grasslands. Grasslands were a new innovation and they changed the planet. You have a lot of grass, you know, the biosphere evolved, grasslands, they swept across the planet. They changed how the planet works. And then the earth moved on with it. Went onto the new experiment. We are what the were exactly that we are like the dinosaurs or the grasslands or the blue green algae that created the oxygen atmosphere and like, you know, we're not, we're, you know, there's no difference between a city in a forest on some biospheric level.

Speaker 1:          00:54:21       We don't suck. The question is whether we're smart enough to still be part of what the, what the biosphere is using us to trigger, you know what I mean? Yeah. What are your thoughts on the reintroduction of extinct animals through genetic cloning? Uh, you know, I watched her risk park whether they're talking about doing like with William mammoths. Yeah. This is a real possibility. Something I know the close ancestor of the woolly mammoth is still alive. I know I'd be down for seeing in my, in my, the moon, the science museum in Rochester. There's a woolly mammoth that they found, you know, and sometimes looking at anything like that giant hairy ass elephant man. And it was walking around right in my, you know, I think like, depending on what you do with it, you know, trying to reintroduce it into the biosphere could be a little dangerous.

Speaker 1:          00:55:05       I mean, the thing, look, climate change is a, this is something I like say climate change is not our fault. And what I mean by that is we, uh, we found fossil fuels and they were awesome, you know, and they were just a continuation of what we'd always done, you know. And so we inadvertently, climate change was a mistake, you know, now, if we don't do something about it, it's our fault, right? But, you know, and so you want to be really careful about unintended consequences, you know. So this is my same thing with, uh, uh, with geoengineering. People talk like, Oh, we should, you know, put a part of particulates in the atmosphere to make it more reflective. I'm like, man, dude, we triggered the whole, we triggered a climate change because, you know, we didn't know what we were doing. We didn't know what the consequences were.

Speaker 1:          00:55:42       We put those articles up there, how do we get them out, get them out with a net? Well, no, no. They'll reign down. You've got to keep putting them in. That's the problem. You got to keep putting them in. So what happens if like one nation decides they don't want to do it anymore, you know, and there the whole thing falls apart. Now suddenly are, you're gonna get massive changes and so like anything like that, like why don't we just work on Matt using fossil fuels? You know what I mean? I take the hardest solution that's got the most uncertainty as opposed to the simpler solution, which just means building a different infrastructure. Yeah. Well especially in California. I mean this is one of the weirdest places ever to not see solar power when it never. It never rained. Should be everywhere, everywhere. Most things should be run on solar power.

Speaker 1:          00:56:21       Why not man? You got solar and so efficient now. Like it's also very difficult to get up and running. Like I had a friend of mine who had his done for four or five months before he got approved because he said they, they make it difficult for you. Yeah. Which is crazy to be on solar power and not be on the grid. So, you know, I mean these are all the kinds of things that we're going to have to work out. I'm hopeful people are like, are you hopeful or not hopeful? Because you know, I mean I ran these, I did these models. One of the pieces of research we did was we modeled planets and civilizations like alien civilizations. We, you know, developed a simple mathematical model about how a civilization will use that planet's resources to make more babies alien babies. And then how the, you know, by using those resources you feedback on the planet.

Speaker 1:          00:57:03       Right. And so what we wanted to do was we wanted to model the possible outcomes. Like what is the generic outcome, you know, if I've got 100,000 civilizations all being born in different places, what's the, you know, in general what happens? And what we found is like basically four different possibilities. One was good news, like in these models there was like, you know, the population shoots up, the planet's temperature shoots up, but they come to a nice steady state, like, you know, you know, the population stable, everything's good. So they're in those models was hope. We also saw die off. We're like the population skyrockets the planet, they overshoot the carrying capacity of their planet and then you get something like 70 percent of the population died off. So like, you know, seven out of every 10 people you know is gone, so you know, but then you come to a steady state so low maybe if you can survive the disaster you can, you're still there.

Speaker 1:          00:57:49       But we also problem with survivor, the disasters, how much of the information gets her story, right? Because you think about if you killing seven out of 10 people, how many of those seven people, the ones who know how to make cell phones. Yeah, exactly. That's a dark age, right? That's what happens to the dark age. I remember the first time I went to Europe and I smelled it was Roman, you know, the aqueducts man, like five stories tall carrying water, you know, and by the 918 nobody knew how they got built a few of those dips in human civilization. Right? And so it's not clear, especially with the society as complex as ours, right? If the food doesn't arrive in my grocery store, what do I do? Right? You know, I garden, but I'm not, not enough. Not enough to keep you alive for a complex civilization like ours.

Speaker 1:          00:58:26       Even if you don't go extinct, you may not be able to have this kind of civilization. But we did find collapse. We did find complete extinction curves as well where, you know, the population went way up and then boom, dropped like a stone and wood even we've and found those. We built into the model as a possibility for the civilization to switch from a high impact resource to a low impact resource like fossil to solar. And sometimes because you know, planets have minds of their own, you know, and there's an internal dynamics, the planets and you push them far enough and there's going to roll off. So we'd have ones where the population went way up. They made the switch and then the population started to come down on the planet. Started to cool down. Did you factor in random geological events? Random solar events, random.

Speaker 1:          00:59:07       This was really all about just planet a civilization and it's feedback on the plan. And you could, we could build models like that. That would be one of the major issues with any advanced civilizations. It's a matter of time before something happens, right? As we said, you know, we know that Mars has been hit before we go or spin hit the moon's been head everything. I mean the moon is one of our best examples would just look at it. You see craters everywhere because it doesn't have an environment or an atmosphere on the moon was built by a huge impact between earth and Mars on Mars, like bottom, you know, at the beginning of the planet's history. So yeah, those happen all the time. I think if you get advanced, you know, so like we're on the lip of being a multi planet species. Right. And once you do that, which means you become a space faring race, then I think like certainly the asteroid stuff you can take care of.

Speaker 1:          00:59:50       Right? We've already done, we have identified like a huge fraction of all the earth crossing asteroids, like we're not really sure what to do about them if we find one coming at us. But we see some coming out us all the time where they just recognize them a few hours before near. Right, right. But it doesn't happen a couple of weeks ago and you know, luckily it always passes. You can always. Yeah. So we couldn't really, you know, we're young enough now that if we discovered one heading right towards us, we could just put down your legs between your head, between your legs and kiss your butt goodbye. Um, but uh, but in time, right, 200 years from now, we will have done a much better job of mapping out all the major rocks. Yeah. Well, I think so, I mean I'm really says, you know, I mean if we have that kind of planetary interplanetary, we're going to be mapping them out just because you don't want to run into them or are you going to be mining them?

Speaker 1:          01:00:34       What do you think is a promising in terms of the ability to prevent impacts? Uh, there's a couple of things. I think the best one, if you catch it early enough, there's the gravity tug. Will you just literally park a spaceship next to it and slowly have the spaceship, you know, move yo because you only have to do is altered the trajectory a little bit. You know, you just don't have the long bonnet. Yeah. And it'll, you know, I'm [inaudible] shit and spaces just so vast that a little tap, we'll make it miss. So the gravity Tokyo, you don't have to try and do the pot. What was it? What was the movie apocalypse? The one with the from the nineties with the, uh, the space miners. Oh, Armageddon. Armageddon. Yeah. Thank you. And then there was a deep impact to deep impact was the smart one.

Speaker 1:          01:01:13       Yeah. Armageddon was the rip each other's off, right, because they're both came out at the same time and I think deep impact came out first, but it was developed second. Ah, yeah, that'd be a bummer to be the one that like, you know, they both come out at the same time and your movie doesn't get any attention and the other one becomes like a massive hit. Wow. So, uh, so like, you know, there they drilled holes and stuff and try and blow them up, but then the problem there is you now have a bunch of rocks and if some of those rocks are big enough. So I think the gravity tug is kind of probably the best idea. But you know, because of um, a mining asteroids will probably, you know, those little ones maybe the easiest to you know, to mind. So what are you worried about more than anything in terms of climate change?

Speaker 1:          01:01:51       Like you worried about the rising of the ocean levels. Are you worried about the heating of the actual planet, the temperature being unsustainable for human life? Like what are you worried about the most? Uh, the one thing I'm worried about the most liquid we're talking before, you know, technological societies are these like overlaid networks, you know, you got the transportation network, you've got the energy network, you've got social networks, you know, and those are really complex. And so I do a little what's called network theory and what you find with network theory is that, you know, you may have an individual network that's pretty robust, meaning like I can cut some of the connections, like you got your social network, I could take, you know, 20 percent of the people out of your social network and the social like will still function, you know, like most people will still talk to each other or anything, but once you start layering them, so at the social network is now connected to the telecommunications network which is connected to the energy network, Blah Blah.

Speaker 1:          01:02:37       Then you can repeat a small change ripples through the whole thing blows it apart. It just doesn't function anymore. So you know, I don't need like apocalypses to have the fabric of technological civilization fall apart. Like, so if the, if just the weather patterns change enough that agriculture becomes really hard, you know, we're used to the rain's falling pretty much the same way they do yearly and everything that, you know, like we talk about, you look at what the refugees, how much trouble you know, having a huge influx of refugees can cause climate change is going to have people moving all over the planet because now they can't grow food anywhere. So it's like I don't, you know, like I said, you don't need. I do worry like ocean rise is going to be huge. Most people live in coastal cities. Most of the wealth in the world is in coastal cities, but you don't really need too much to like really shift the weather patterns. And then the thing you're used to falls apart

Speaker 2:          01:03:28       now when you factor in human beings and our evolution from primitive hominids to what we are today. And you sort of extrapolate and keep going and think about what we're going to be in the future. And then think about what these creatures might be that live 100 million light years away or whatever. The fuck it is what I mean we've got, I've got to think that whatever is holding us back, our primitive instincts, these human reward systems that were engaged when we were running away from wild animals and fighting off tribes have invaders that slowly but surely those are going to either evaporate or evolve and we're going to get to a point where we can be more rational about complex issues if we do do that. Like what is the motivation for expanding the human race? Isn't sustaining the human race in a healthy way on this planet a better option than traveling to Mars or traveling to other solar systems? Like wouldn't we be better served trying to achieve some sort of a balance here on this planet?

Speaker 1:          01:04:41       I think the, um, I think one serves the other. Like we, you know, you look at the human migration patterns from when we started, right? And you know, we started off as a, you know, a bunch of people in Africa, Africa, maybe a few thousand, right? And then you see this migration like, or you know, a bunch of us, like a few hundred crossed the Red Sea, which was pretty low at the time. And then it's like they just worked their way around the coasts, you know, boats over to Australia went all the way back around through like we're explorers, man. Like these, you know, it's really, I think something fundamental for us psychologically to have these frontiers. Exactly. That's my question is will we evolve past that? Well, I don't think that's a bad thing. I don't think so. Yeah. Yeah. I don't think this bad thing because again, it goes back to the biosphere.

Speaker 1:          01:05:24       This is kind of like, I think there's something deep in life that wants more life. Right? So if we call, you know, Settle Mars, right, then it's not going to be really us settling Mars. It's going to be the earth's biosphere, right. I mean really are we are, we're the agent of the biosphere. Right. And you know, the biosphere started off as like, you know, single celled creatures in like little tiny parts of the planet. And then you have conquered the oceans. And then eventually when they were, because in the beginning there weren't continents, there was a water world when we started off. And so when, you know, there was enough continence, um, you know, then they took over the life, took over the land. I think it's just Kinda, life may be kind of like a cosmic force, if I can get ugly on you, if we do go to Mars and will essentially be ultimate panspermia.

Speaker 1:          01:06:04       Yes, exactly. Right. Yeah. And that way, right. Panspermia, which is we were always a weird word to kind of pants for me because people feel weird about sperms whenever I give an academic talk. And I'm like, I know it's a strange when you say sperm in front of people that are like you piece of shit. Yeah, right. It's like a scientific term, man. I swear a matter. It's like saying niggardly. Yeah. Right. So it's very difficult word to say. No, it has nothing to do with the n word. Yeah. So, um, uh, you know, I think, I think it's part of life. I think life wants more life. And this is the question you're raising about, look, what do we look like in a million years? What happens to a species that become. And you know, now we're in the realm of science fiction, but it's all cool. Um, you know, like what might we become like the gods in some scenes.

Speaker 2:          01:06:48       I think that this is my theory and I've thrown this out so many times, people are sick of it, but I think that what we're looking at when we see these archetypal aliens with the big heads and the big eyes and the tiny bodies and no genitals, I think we think this is what we're eventually going to be. We're going to move past that man. I'll see you in your panspermia and I'll raise you typically typically talking about gender. This is the problem and this is why we need diversity. Um, I just think that if we. So those are archetypes kind of built into some sense that we're moving pat. Like, well, what did we used to be? Well, we used to be monkeys, right? What are we going to be? What we're going to be that thing, that thing that can levitate things, but it's mind the thing to communicate telepathically, that thing that has this incredible ability to map out the cosmos and create wormholes and the super advanced advanced to a point where we can't even comprehend. So like if you think about how, what, you know w w we evolved from at one point in time, we split from mollusks like what? 600 something

Speaker 1:          01:08:06       years ago. It's got to be on it. It's got to be past the Cambrian explosion, but you know, it's like, yeah, 300, 400. I don't know yet.

Speaker 2:          01:08:11       So awhile ago. How, how much does a squid understand about

Speaker 3:          01:08:16       cell phone networks and whether or not it's sprint's unlimited data plan plans. Really any good picked out. We'll we'll extrapolate that to what this alien creature is going to be in terms of its understanding of time and space and matter versus ours. We are this crude thing that's weirded out by the word sperm. Whereas it is telepathically communicating with a universal language and it has this unbelievable ability to manipulate matter and they've achieved homeostasis with their environment. No longer have this. Well that's one of the things about, you know, there's the Fermi paradox, right? Yeah. Like why haven't we seen so, you know, as I already said, we haven't looked enough to say that the, we haven't seen evidence of life, right. It's like opening your door and goes, well where are all the buffalo to go to Wyoming.

Speaker 3:          01:09:06       But there, you know, there is a kind of a problem with because we just do a paper on this now, you know, part of the permit paradox. Let's go. I don't want to go too far on this. Can we can go back circle back? Um, I liked it. So he had ducks is fascinating. It is, right? So the, so the, the, the idea that we had two people. Okay. So the Fermi paradox is the idea that like, uh, you know, what if there is, if the paradox part is like, if you're telling me that intelligence is commented, evolves everywhere, then why don't I see it already. Right? So the, the, if you're asking about like why don't we see signals from that, I've already answered that, right? Because we just, we haven't looked yet so yet, but hit part of his question and this was done by a guy in heart.

Speaker 3:          01:09:42       I mean, so for me it was just, this happened over a conversation in, for lunch, you know, in 1950. So he just posed the, he said where are they all? But in 1975 guy named Hart wrote a paper where he really mapped out the here's the main problem. Even if you're traveling with a 10th of the speed of light, if you managed to build like world ships that can travel across the stars, you know, and you're traveling at point one percent of the speed of light in, you know, if you do that and you hop from one store to the other, build another ship, hop to the next one in about 600,000 years. You have covered the whole galaxy, right? So 600,000 years. Sounds like a long time, but it's a tiny part of the galaxies history, galaxies, 10 billion years old. So in that case, like why every, if just one species has to do that and they can cover the galaxy.

Speaker 3:          01:10:25       So why aren't they? Why don't we see the colony ships here? Right? That's, that's a much harder version of the fermi paradox to get around. Is it though, because if we did. Look, we're already sending robots to Mars, right? We're not going to Mars yet, but we're sending robots there. What if we decide that there's no real benefit in sending biological entities into space and that the dangers of radiation and asteroidal impacts on this is just too great. It's far better to send something. I mean, look at what we're capable of doing now in terms of projection of video. We can take a cell phone video and you could send it to your friend in New Zealand and they can get it almost instantaneously to go to do a skype call where we can get some sort of three d, virtual reality imaging of these planets like, Hey, do you want to see what it's like on Pandora here? Put these goggles on and you will go wherever you want that robot to go and you'll be there. Right? And maybe it'll get to the point where you can actually smell it and touch it and feel it and, but not be compromised by its environment in terms of your bio.

Speaker 1:          01:11:29       Well that's actually a huge point. So that's one of the things we're looking at in this paper is the idea that, you know, good planets may be hard to find. You know, there's this great novel by Kim Stanley Robinson who's like, just for me, one of the great science fiction writers, it's called Aurora and then you know, the usual worldship thing go. So they build the colony ship, it takes three generations to cross space and they get to the planet and the planet socks, it looked like it was going to be good, you know, but there's like prions tiny or super small biological shit that just makes you can't live there and then going back. Right. So it's like, it may be exactly like you're saying that, you know, we think like, oh, you just land on a planet, your terraform it and you know, you just turned it into a habitable and it's like, that may not work and maybe it does, but that's a science fiction. I do. So, uh, right. It's entirely possible. I mean, there's a lot of possible solutions is, which is just that, uh, you know, one of which is space is really hard and really interstellar, not interplanetary, but interstellar travel is really hard and really expensive. I was just reading the paper on this with a guy estimated that in order to get, like, say you wanted to have a thousand people on a worldship to get to another star that would take the economy that come need like a, I think was like 100,000 Earth economies

Speaker 3:          01:12:34       to build that Jeff Paizos are you listening time? We're ready. You might have, but it was just like it was so much,

Speaker 1:          01:12:43       you know, you. Unless you were. He said, you know what the conclusion he came to, unless you were a multi planet species, if you were like, uh, if you had conquered the entire um, uh, or settled the entire solar system, maybe you'd have an economy that big. So one, one possible solution is good planets are hard to find. And um, and uh, you know, it's just too expensive. It really costs a lot. And so yeah, it's not really worth the effort. You know, you send out some probes once in a while, but yeah,

Speaker 3:          01:13:07       no, it's not. Well, it's also finding an environment that's not just habitable but stable in our environment is habitable. But look what's going on in Hawaii right now. There is a 400 year old lake that evaporated in a matter of hours, right? It's the biggest lake on the big island. It's gone. Which is such a tragedy, but it's not. It's not. It's magnificent. Right? And you watch that lava roll into that lake and say that's a wrap. Kids no more lakey flux. And it really shows you the power of a planet to that sources at work. What makes continents? I mean it made the island in the first place. You can't be upset at it. Billowing off. It is what made the island right. It's continuing to make the island here, right? Yeah. Right, exactly. That's right about your house. But now you've got more real estate.

Speaker 3:          01:13:52       So shout out. It's making the island bigger and it's always done that. It's been doing that for millions of years. It's a fascinating place. If you've been. I've been and I've seen the. I want you to do the work. Did you do the helicopter thing? No, man, you got to do the helicopter thing. It's crazy because you fly over the volcanoes. We can't now because it's too crazy, but I did a few back and you could watch it. The lava go into the ocean and you see these lava events. Poor is red hot fucking. It's like, it's glowing. It's going into the ocean that I saw that part. We went to the park to see it, you know, and then when you went to, when you go to that volcano park, there's just like vince were steams coming out like New York City with the, you know, the manholes.

Speaker 3:          01:14:33       You're like, that's just from this heat coming in from the bottom of the planet. Are you scared about yellowstone? Uh, like the uh, what was that movie? A 2012 map. Like where did that. Because that's such a. that's like a, that's what made the adirondacks right. What was the 2012 movie? I never saw that with ge Qa after tomorrow. Day. Before tomorrow. No, no, no, no. It was a, it was a climate change. It was John cusack. It's actually a pretty good movie. Yeah. That's another, like destroy the plant. Those guys who made that. Hold on, stop right there. That was not a pretty good movie. That movie sucked. Thought it was good. I'm moving so stupid, stupid mistake. Disaster by inches with the cars. They never got a flat. They always got away from the. The world caving in. Totally believable, man. Oh yeah, yeah.

Speaker 3:          01:15:20       No, I thought. Well, yellowstone is a caldera. It's a super volcano and they're experiencing thousands of earthquakes a year and that eventually every six to 800,000 years. It's a continent killer. The last time it blew was 600,000 years ago. So why aren't you scared? Uh, I don't know, I just don't think about it. I'm fucking thinking about it every day, man. I'll smoke a joint. I think about once a month I think about, you know, I should. Okay. I'm gonna. Add that to my list of things. I'm freaking out about it. I have friends in Australia and that's where I'm going because there's light over. Just start driving on the left hand side. That's the only thing you can go to. I worried more about Seattle. I lived in Seattle for a while and they said the super earthquake that they're looking at it, it's going to turn the whole thing into Jello.

Speaker 3:          01:16:00       Right. You get an earthquake so bad that the ground just literally becomes porous. Is it really that scary? They're, yeah, they're predicting because, you know, Seattle's got like, I mean, I don't know that much about this. I'm way out of my. I'm in the danger zone. Um, the plates are super deep, you know, so you don't get as many tremors but, but you know, when it releases, it's gonna be a super powerful earthquake and you know, it'll, it'll be so powerful. Yeah. That they said that like there's not going to be even, even with the earthquake, proofing is not gonna be be left standing. Jesus. So yeah, dad, Seattle, you must be, I mean, because you're here, right? You feel tremors. They might say they happen all the time. Right. I've only been a few times, but not all the time I've felt them before.

Speaker 3:          01:16:38       The, the biggest ones I ever felt was when I first moved here. I first moved here in [inaudible] 94 and it was right after the northridge earthquake and uh, I was in my house and I felt, uh, I guess it was like a five point five where the whole thing just, it was weird, but it gave me the impression that the house that I was living in or the apartment that I was in was made out of the same stuff, like a box that a refrigerator would come in, you can move it around inside. The whole thing was just moving like easily and right. I was like,

Speaker 1:          01:17:10       Holy Shit. That was my. I've only had a few times that I've felt like I'm like, it's like it's, you know, at first I thought it was a truck. I thought the truck was rolling by, you know, and I'm like, oh, somebody says, no man, that was an earthquake. And the one that I experienced was nothing. I mean, there's a baby one ones that they're getting, you know, right now, somewhere in the world. I mean there's, there's always something that's like a five or six. Yeah. So this goes back to your point about the, uh, you know, a lot of planets, right? We'll be like way more plate tectonically active volatile than ours. So, you know, I mean a lot of times and I think good planets are going to be really hard to find. So, you know, it may be, that may be the solution.

Speaker 1:          01:17:46       The other solution is, you know, I mean, the way you guys found out about me, so I did that article about the previous civilization, you know, like what is it, how do you know whether or not there was a previous civilization? And uh, you know, um, one solution could be that, look they were here, you know, that somebody did arrive and spend some time on earth, but if it was like half a billion years ago and they only lasted, right? Every civilization has a finite lifetime. They only lasted for, you know, even a few hundred thousand years. They wouldn't leave. There'd be no record left to, it'd be nothing, there'd be nothing. Do you think that's possible that something's ever visited here? And because that is the big question and that's the, the, the thing that gets the UFO dorks more jazzed up than anything is the possibility that we'd been visited.

Speaker 1:          01:18:26       Yeah. Not In the. I'm definitely not UFOS. There's, there's two arguments against you if owes a. One is as, as you know, a friend of mine, Jason Wright says, it's like, look as astronomers, man, we were finding all those aspects. We're finding a little chunks of rock movement. You know, nobody looks at the sky harder than we do. Right. And you know, if anything, unless you want to go to the conspiracy theories, we would've found something. My other argument is like, what's with the headlights? You know what I mean? People always like, Oh man, I saw lights in the sky. And then they moved around and then they disappeared, you know, but they don't really want to be seen. I'm like, well, why do they have headlights on? Like why just turn off the fricking nights. It just. Why would they have lights in the first place?

Speaker 1:          01:19:01       You came from another civilization and you can't get around without your high beams. You know the ideas like what the fuck are you seeing? What those lights, right? You're not seeing shit. That was the last time you saw me. Planes have lights so other planes don't run into them. They don't have the light so they could see where they're going. Yeah. So what. So why do they have. Right, exactly. The planes have lights so other people can seem. So they're here but they're mysterious. They don't want to be found in turn off the fricking light. So they. Yeah, they wouldn't have any lines, but yeah, they always have lights. Yeah. People are always seeing, like eliminate. I liked this guy and then they moved back and forth. And so also the problem with human memory. Memory's horrible memory of events that are stunning or shocking or unnerving or you think you saw something, right?

Speaker 1:          01:19:39       They've done all that research even in trials, right? Where people see things, you know, just kinda like. But do you think it's possible that there could be life on other planets and it's possible there could be intelligent life on other planets and we send probes to Mars, why wouldn't. And I think that if they do send something here, they're going to send something without biological life inside of it. Yeah. Yeah. Well, this is, you know, it's a really interesting question is like you were talking about like what will we evolve into in, you know, a million years, uh, you know, it may be possible that biology is

Speaker 3:          01:20:07       a short period of intelligence. You build machines and the machines become, you know, you download yourself into. I mean, that's a real possibility that like, you know, silicon makes a lot more sense than wetware. Well, the problem is we think of artificial intelligence as artificial, right? It's definitely real, right? Yeah. No, that's exactly. It's not, it's not fake. It's right there. You know, it's like there's artificial milk, you know what I mean? But it's, it's a liquid, it's an actual liquid. There's not an artificial life. It's just silicon created life. But again, the idea of the biosphere, this may be the what the biosphere solution to spreading itself to getting it maybe that, like silicon, that that's kind of a normal face. I am super skeptical about the whole trans human thing that we're going to download ourselves and do intelligent. You don't. Have you ever gone to one of those conventions, knows dorks.

Speaker 3:          01:21:00       There's some pretty serious dork in. Well, there's geniuses in those dorks too. It's really interesting. It's like they're fully wholly committed to this prospect of downloading themselves. You've talked Kurtzweil before. Uh, no, but I've read his stuff. I had a chance to interview him a few years back for smart, but he's just like beyond smart, but God damn is he committed to it. And then when you get to it, you realize that what he actually wants to do is recreate his father. Yeah. He's his father died when he was young and he wants to be able to through memories and photographs and what he knows about his father, literally recreate his father and to be able to have a conversation with them. He was talking about this. Right? But what he's doing is he's going way, way into the future, into the possibilities of he's not seeing like, well, five years from now we're going to be able to send, you know, gigabyte pictures to them, you know, he's saying let's think of if you keep going exponentially and the electronics and technology and innovation keeps continually accelerating.

Speaker 3:          01:22:03       We could potentially get to the point where it's the impossible. Well, you'd be able to recreate human beings based on your knowledge of them and then they'll be able to come up with some sort of a program. Will he'll be able to have a conversation with his father. Yeah. See, I think that misunder. I mean, I think it's, you know, it's true, but like the possibility of a singularity and technological development, but you know, it's not going to be his father. That's the sad thing. You know, I think we seriously, I've done some work on this as an interest of mine about mind. What is mind and what's the relationship between mind and matter? And um, I think we have like a serious misunderstood. We don't understand consciousness very well at all. So the idea that like, oh yeah, it's just got to be trivial to download your, you know, your consciousness into a computer.

Speaker 3:          01:22:45       I think it's pretty, you know, there's like a shit load of assumptions in there about like what mind is and the relationship between your neurons and you know, awareness. So that's why I think those guys, it's a little bit of a religion, you know what I mean? It is a little bit, you know, so it's like, well 20, 45 is the new benchmark for whatever reason, that's the new number. They keep going back. It's gonna be like every other, every other rapture. We thought it was 20, 45. We really been 20 slash 65. We went to this 20, 45 conference, me and my friend Ran Duncan and we got to talk to some of these guys and it's really fascinating and one of them had created some robot that was supposed to be him but it didn't work well. So they never revealed that at the conference that had too many bugs in it.

Speaker 3:          01:23:30       It's intriguing. It's like I want them to keep going because I mean, when, when are we going to get to x Mokena? When are we going to get to talk about good movies? Or did you like that? One of my favorite movies ever. So smart. So like, just like simple. He's not beating you over the head with it and know, cut the shit most moving moments in that movie. You were like, whoa. The entire. I think that's one of my all time top 20 movies, which he stabs him just emotionless. Just family. I'm putting the blade in. It was amazing. Amazing alert. Did you like annihilation? Because I didn't like it as much but I liked it. It was very weird and the ending seemed like some producers put their just in the soup just like Pittsburgh, what's happening here? Who made this part? Yeah.

Speaker 3:          01:24:13       Uh, but I, I enjoyed it. So I think like, you know, the danger with anything when it comes to ai. And so when you. Here's an interesting thing about ai, like we're, we are getting, making amazing strides with ai now. Now artificial intelligence is different from artificial consciousness. You know what I mean? So, but um, but the ai that, you know, what we're getting out of it is nothing like us, right? So the, you know, back in the day where people were like, oh, we're going to model the human brain and that's how we'll do it. Well, like programs that are what and what they've learned is like, ah, that doesn't really work that well. So now this whole big data thing like, you know, network theory and big data and deep learning, we're like, you know, they're using statistical, you know, the power of, of having huge amounts of computing and statistical reasoning so that like, you know, get the computer, like, you know, it'll find the picture of the cat, but you have no idea why it found that it didn't reason like, oh yeah, that was sort of looks like cat and I like cats, you know, it was just like, oh, these kinds of lines go with that kind of thing and it has no idea what it's doing, but it'll act intelligently.

Speaker 3:          01:25:10       And so that's, you know, I mean that's kind of freaky deaky in a lot of ways too. I think people are, I think it's smart to think about the dangers of Ai. Not necessarily want to take some pictures to us. Yeah. Not necessarily the dangers, just the dangers to this thing that we are this weird monkey thing that wants to keep being a monkey thing. Well, you mean in the sense of like, right, that it's going to replace us? Yes. Yeah. Yeah. I think it's inevitable. I mean, don't you think that if you go back and interview the single celled organism before branched off into multicell multicell bullshit. I don't want to stay a single cell at the bottom of the rock and roll music and they're to mail cars. Fuck that. I don't want a car man. I like stand down here. There are some real thought to that, that we are the wetware that is the problem.

Speaker 3:          01:26:02       No, no. Listen, I, I think it's fully conceivable, like I'm not going do it. It'll never happen. But as a guy knows, a philosopher says, you know, there's a certain way in which everything we do with ai right now, it's not like, you know, Watson is playing chess. It's like we're using Watson to play chess. It's our tool, you know, and I think the fear is the toolkits add a hand, not that it develops a thing where like I hated humans, you know, dad, I hate you, but more that it's like, you know, these things which are not actually thinking, they act intelligent but they're not thinking can have a huge. Like it'll have a really negative impact, you know, it'll, it'll, you know, what does it, there's that example of like, if you design something that is an ai system to make paperclips, it ends up consuming the entire planet making paperclips because that's what you told it to do.

Speaker 3:          01:26:44       Right. You never told it to make a sustainable amount of. Right. Exactly. So I'm, I'm more worried about that than I am of like Sky Net, you know, coming over and like, you know, deciding that it's going to take a drop all the bombs on it because it needs to get rid of it. Well there's no biological imperative for a silicon based artificial intelligence to procreate to keep going and move forward. Like why do they do that? You do it because we came from biology. Biology needs to stay alive and everybody wants bigger, faster, stronger. You want to keep moving and it's because there's a real possibility that you might get consumed by some other life form. So you have to protect yourself and you have to look out for other people who might want to breed with the viable female that you've copulated with. There's a lot of shit going on built in evolutionarily to have.

Speaker 3:          01:27:32       But we assume that somehow or another these artificial creations will have as well, which is why, right? I mean yeah, like if we program it in. So the thing is like, but will it wake up like so that if it does wake up, will it have the inclination towards scientific research? Would it even want to send something through the cosmos of us? Yeah. No, that's a really interesting. I, you know, and I think we just don't know if it actually because listen, we, we understand so little about what consciousness is and what its imperatives are like. Yeah. Once you wake up and you're like, oh, you're dead, you know, dad, I got to see like why? Like, who knows what really did you like Battlestar Galactica? I loved Battlestar. God damn good. Was that the new version? I love the old version because that I was 14 years old and spaceships, but the new version was amazing.

Speaker 3:          01:28:19       Smart. If there is a show that I wish they would bring back, it's Battlestar Galactica the ending. But the ending though it was, you know, they had to end it is all right. But the fucking series was brilliant. It was brilliant. You know what was amazing about that? The way they wrapped, like all the political shit that was happening after nine slash 11 to that man from the torture scenes. Yeah man, it was so. And then they even had the whole thing with starbuck about know what was she, you know, there's a couple of like it was five years. Right. And there were a couple of seasons where like, it Kinda got a little ran off the rails. But what's her name? Katie sackhoff. Is that her name? Who? Starbuck? Yeah. Is that her name? Yeah, she's so good. She was really good in that role stuff since she's got a movie out right now on Netflix.

Speaker 3:          01:29:03       I haven't seen it. Right. But I'm saying like, Oh yeah, there's, you know, but she had rights. You sort of disappeared. It was so good in that show. I was like, well this is, this is like the launching pad for her. Yeah. And you almost revolutionary about that show to the way they did the special effects were like, oh, the camera moved around. Like there's a spaceship, but um, you know, I don't have. It. Didn't do, you know, sometimes it did those long pants, but it was kind of opened up a whole new way of sort of looking at, uh, you know, just sort of what it looks like to be in space and stuff. Yeah. But it really scared the shit out of people in terms of artificial life. Something that we create the decides it's done with us and it's taking over. Well, you know, what's amazing about that, and this is I've written about this, this idea that like, you know, we keep telling that story over and over again.

Speaker 3:          01:29:40       How many movies, you know, can you think of that, have that. And I think like, so I'm really interested in myth, right? That, you know, the whole mythology, the way like, you know, we can never get away from the myths, you know, coming of age, the hero's journey, Campbell, Joseph Campbell, Joseph Campbell Fan. Um, but like you know, what's happening with us now, we got, there's nothing in, there's nothing in the storehouse of myth to take care of like building machines that take over. Right? So the reason we keep telling that story over and over again is we're preparing ourselves, right? We're building the myths, you know, that sort of will help. We don't know what's going to happen, but we have to keep telling that story because we can feel it coming, you know what I mean, like this is. So we need to keep telling a story to kind of explore what the options are.

Speaker 3:          01:30:20       And I liked that too. I liked about the ending and I didn't think the ending was great. But the idea that like, oh yeah, this balance, you know, you get to keep going through these cycles of trying to achieve this balance between, you know, silicon forms and non silica and then biological forms. But um, well we have not, we were worried that we're going to be taken over by something else, but we're not overly concerned with evolving our own biology changing. And maybe that's the solution in terms of our physical limitations is some sort of a symbiotic connection between us and technology. That instead of artificial technology and artificial life taking over usurping us instead of that maybe we become a part of it and it becomes a part of us and we. I mean, you have glasses on, you can see better with those glasses. That's essentially a Cyborg. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Right, right, right. And these things, you know, these cell phones, my God, my memories in there, right to no cell phones. My house two days ago without my phone and I turned around in a panic on my own street. Where's my fucking. I was like, no. You remember when you used to have phone numbers in your head? Oh yeah.

Speaker 3:          01:31:24       My wife's number. I can't. Like I got three digits. Adam go further than this crazy. But we remember a lot of other stuff now. I mean, you have so much. I mean I'm, I'm really overwhelmed. I think I'm in that weird zone where I just don't have, I don't, I don't have enough data space. I don't have enough storage for all of us. That's. You've got to kind of pick and choose, right? Sort of like wikipedia. We're all human knowledge. Entire sum of human knowledge is right there, you know, mean like, Whoa, what are you talking about? Changes. Right? So you were talking about what

Speaker 1:          01:32:00       an amazing change that you can have. Pretty much, you know, like, you know, I love comics, right? You know, I was a comic marvel guy way back. Right. And back in the day, you know, you paid for your, you had to, you know, first of all you got your ass kicked. But um, you know, you have to go to the store every week and get the comics and you know, and now you know, you just look up captain America and you can know everything. There was about his, you know, his origin story and everything. So it's like that idea that like there's no domains of knowledge that you can't instantly access and have all the backstory that you need to be a physical comic. Books are amazing, but I have to be honest, comic books on an Ipad or better because you don't see the next frame.

Speaker 1:          01:32:37       Yeah, yeah. You just swipe and then you get the next frame. You don't, you don't see it in advance. Like if you're reading the left side, Dr. Change and the right side is an explosion and you're like, well I see that and see that shit's coming next. Like it's kind of a shitty way to do it. No, I agree. I have an ipad. It's fucking amazing. Amazing. Yeah. No. When you do that thing and now with the, it's like embarrassing as a professor of physics at a major university. I have like $3,000 for the comic books. Embarrassing. It's not embarrassing. Can't be still brilliant guy. But he just also like cool shit. Yeah. Well shouldn't I be reading like those, the Esky or something? I don't know. You fumble, you know, my dad was, my dad was always like, because my dad was a writer, a comic books, you know, but I was like, Dad, I've learned that especially with marvel, right.

Speaker 1:          01:33:19       Marvel a great language, right? I mean the word synopsis from Marvel, you know, so uh, especially, you know, some of the like doctor strange had some great shit, you know. Fantastic. Four. Yeah. No, the doctors, you know, it's, I was this the science advisor for doctor strange with, for the movie, for the movie? Yeah, it was best. I always say, I said you have to correct anything. No, no, not really because they called me in. So I know Scott Derrick's actually had lunch with or breakfast with Scott yesterday. I know Scott from my first book, which is about science and religion, you know, so you know, we've got somebody connected us and we'd been talking for a long time and when he got tapped to do doctor strange, he contacted, I got the email, said marvel wants to talk to you, you know, it's like, yeah, I got out there for a day and met Kevin fee man.

Speaker 1:          01:34:04       It was just like, oh man. And so we basically worked on, he wanted to work on to two things for that. And what's funny is I never read Dr. Strange, right? Because I was like a science guy was all about Tony Stark or you know, or you know, or a spiderman or the x men. So I never, I was like, Oh God uses magic. So think we have to figure out was um, first of all that that scene where he first do the counters, the ancient one, you know, and she has to kind of like, you know, school him on, there's more ways to think about the world beyond science and then the, the multiverse. That was the other thing because I've written the blog a lot on the multiverse, but man, it was awesome. It was so much fun to be in the writer's room, you know, with them and just like be throwing around ideas.

Speaker 1:          01:34:42       Wow. Yeah. No it was. And it'll probably never ever happen again. But I don't care. You know, how to care. I got my shot. That was a weird thing that when you're young you like all this cool stuff, but then when you get old you're supposed to be more pragmatic. You're supposed to abandon that stuff and be mature. But when I was a kid I was super embarrassed when I became an adult that I still like muscle cars. It's like, why do I like these stupid things? And I loved them. I would see one drive by here, the rumble and go, Ooh, that's awesome. That thing, and then when I became an older adult I was like, who gives a fuck? That's really what it is. That's where I'm now looking at what Karen's manager, because I love video games. I play a lot of video games and people was like, oh my God, your children.

Speaker 1:          01:35:23       Yeah, dude, awesome man. There was nothing. There is no better way to kill an hour, especially after a stressful day then to go and shoot aliens. You know what I mean? This is like, you know what I mean? This stimulates the mind. I mean, Jamie and I have talked about this many times, that we have this deep appreciation for chess and go and all these ancient games. There are games like starcraft and even like one on one quake matches that require intense calculating. Right? You have to think about the environment understanding of the map that you're right, you're competing in. It's, there's a lot of strategy. No, that's really good about it. I mean, I, I tend to be, I do a lot. I really like rpgs. You know, so with a map and everything, so one of them everquest dorks. Oh, well I don't do, I don't do anything multi player.

Speaker 1:          01:36:05       Right? Because I'm so bad at it that like, I know there's some kids, some 13 year old in Korea. It was just like your dad or your dead spawn dies. Spawn. But I like something with a really good story. You know, whether you would. What's the game you like? Oh God, my favorite game is last of us. What does that. Oh Man, last bucket. Because I don't want, I don't like Zombie Games because I could scared being scared when I, I saw um, when we do the living versus zombies. That's a nice simple one that might work. Uh, no, I still have the um, now the living dead when I was 12 it was on pbs and little screen and it just like after that. I'm sorry. Zombies. Wow. Yeah, it was, I can't believe they put it on tv like, you know, for the 11:00 show.

Speaker 1:          01:36:45       So, but last of us is kind of a Zombie survival story, but it's beautiful. I mean, it's really the narrative of it. It's this guy your 20 years after and the thing about this thing, it opens up with the, you know, the Zombie outbreak happening and the guy loses his daughter, like you see him lose his daughter and it's so, well, it's the same company that did, um, uh, uncharted, which are other. I really like those as well. Um, and so she's like, the acting in it was really beautiful and then, you know, it's 20 years later and this guy is broken, you know what I mean? Like he's just, he's, you know, he's, he survived in this, you have the society's falling apart. Um, but, uh, you know, he just track him as he gets this, this young girl who is immune and he's got to take her cross country to, you know, and you're following this guy story and you know, then there's zombies and there's a, the theme of a movie, a really recent movie.

Speaker 1:          01:37:34       Wasn't that like a, a foreign movie with a Foreign Zombie movie that was supposed to be very good. But that was the idea behind it. It was, but it was his own daughter wasn't. Maybe it wasn't the fact that they took it from this because you know, so last of us is one like huge amounts of awards. How old is it? Six years, maybe less. Month two is just about to come out. Well, the sports center movies older than that, I believe because it came out right around the time where his wife left him because he banged the maid.

Speaker 1:          01:38:09       Whoops. Downfall. Lips. He was the governor then wasn't even the governor. He's there. He's posting. It was post. It was post post governor. Um, but that, that theme is a reoccurring theme that is a reoccurrence of telling you. How many times is that comeback? The plague wipes people out. They come back to life. There's zombies. So you gotta wonder what's up with that, like why is that something that's like stirring around in our head? I think the apocalypse is because we kind of feel nervous about what's happening with us because we can see sort of sure. Pushing up against boundaries. We're also vulnerable. Yeah. Running. We're vulnerable to disease and we're vulnerable. I mean, there's so many different things that people can get. Rabies and malaria plagues we used to have plagues all the time, you know, so yeah. No, but that's what makes this game so great is that it really takes the world after the fall, seriously.

Speaker 1:          01:38:56       And it's heartbreaking. You know what I mean? That's, it's beautifully done, scarier than Shit, but, you know, beautifully done. And it's, for me, it's like everything that I love mostly because like you're saying is you get into these situations and you know you're going to get killed. You look, there's dark souls were like, there's no getting through dark, dark souls. Apparently the most hardest game ever. I've never played it. But you know, this game is hard and you got to keep it as dark souls. Dark souls is a, it's also a story based, uh, you know, open world games, single player, I think that it's probably a multiplayer mode, but um, uh, it's like, you know, a kind of an elvish, you know, you're in that kind of world. You're just trying to stay alive, trying to stay alive. And it's just like the hardest game ever.

Speaker 1:          01:39:32       That's what they say. Um, but like, you know, I said a good hard game. You gotta you know, you gotta you can keep going back like, oh, I just died. All right, let me try it. Let me try coming around from this side, you know, Oh, let me use this weapon. Let me get on this. It's really that we did, uh, my, my, um, I had a text book that just came out a couple of years ago and we did a video game. We built a full first ever full video game for an intro astronomy course. And the whole idea was like, the coolest thing about a game is like the first thing you have to do is learn the rules. Right? And that's what makes being in a game world interest there, you know, there's a whole set of rules, got know how to craft.

Speaker 1:          01:40:04       You got to know which weapons to use in different kinds of situations. And our idea with the video game was like, just make the real. The real rules make um, the science rules, right? Oh, you want to go mine an asteroid? Well, how do you know which asteroid has, you know, the, the most, uh, you know, uh, or in it, you know, I'm just going to do what you're going to do normally do an astronomy. So I think like, you know, video games have not recognized. They haven't, like you said, people don't understand actually how important they are for teaching, for all kinds of things. Video Games and for entertaining, you know, for, for a future of storytelling to. Well people take them, they think that it's a waste of time until they find out how much these professionals make it. So saying that some guy, what, what is the number? That kid was making $500,000 a month playing fortnite. Wasn't that what Sean, that sugar. But it's way more than that. He makes more than that. So what is fortnight you? Can somebody explain fortnight to me? I'm sorry,

Speaker 3:          01:40:54       I'm still in far cry. Five crazy third person shooter. You're jumping around shooting be boomed with third person shooters. But like is it a story or is it just like you're, you know, you've got other people people up. I think the story is really just drop it into survive. Oh yeah, there's no campaign mode or if they're just, there is, but that's a separate. That's not whatever. That's interesting to me about fortnight. The graphics suck. I don't want you. To me, that's a graphic style that those hit at that it has like a, like a, uh, xbox to sort of. Yeah. Somebody had a, uh, an image and it was from 2007. It said, man, look at this. I wonder what video games are going to be looking like. The graphics gonna be looking like a 2018, and then it shows fort night and it's like, this is like, dude, they're just like, they've turned the textures off.

Speaker 3:          01:41:40       They 100 percent. You turned the textures off when you play online, if you don't have a powerful enough computer, sure you don't like claiming. Right? So it doesn't make your streaming, it doesn't make your video game. Video card works so hard, but also it makes it easier to recognize shapes because they're not like, that was the thing that did with quake. They would completely turn the textures off when guys would be like playing in high level matches and you would just deal with these flat walls and then the object, the person that you were fighting against, what they would stand out and start contrast. Right, right. So you didn't have, you know, otherwise you'd be in this castle wall. You'd have the incredible textures on the wall and you wouldn't be able to see them as easily too distracting. Mean. That's one of the thing I think I love about video games too, is like the scenery, you know, sometimes I just want to stop and be like, that's it.

Speaker 3:          01:42:25       The right side has full graphics, not so it depends on what you were actually. The right side is reasonable. I mean it still is a little bit. That's not much different at all. Yeah. Yeah. I mean sort of the left side is just dark. There's grass. Yeah. Look at the graph building. There's still some movement on the ground. It's not flat plain like it isn't quick. Go to quake, play, go to quake three, no textures. Make a video or pull up a video of that and you'll see what I'm talking about when I'm talking about is like literal flat walls where people turned everything off and it got to a point where they weren't allowing it and certain competitions because it makes such a big difference because now you're just like, it's a target in front of a blank screen. They also, you could also replace all of the characters with a larger character, like a, like say if you were playing as this girl, so I get this one.

Speaker 3:          01:43:19       It's showing the mod in between. Maybe I'm thinking, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I'm losers quake. I've heard of. Or you pitch. No, no. Jamie, pull, pull up, quake, no textures, pull up, quake, no textures, and then you could watch what it looks like. That is not. No textures, that that's different. You can see the difference in the colors and things are moving. It's when they turn off all the textures, you, you get to see these flat. Well, that's what it looks like. Seat. Yeah. Now that is a way different experience. It would be much easier to see. Right. You can't see those still exist, but all the textures are gone and if you show a video that see if you could find a video that jamie when in the videos you see things moving around with no textures and you realize what an advantage it would be if you were playing someone who's.

Speaker 3:          01:44:10       You're constantly dealing with all this visual input. You have all this different shit, high visibility and quake three that it's hard to find out. Is this. Which game is this? Quake live. Oh, okay. This is again, I still got to ask what is quick? I mean, I know I've heard of it but I've never played it. Like it's the ultimate first person shooter and it's the original one. It was originally quake one and. Well there was doom but it was doing. I've heard of like I've even, we did doom, didn't they? They came out with another. Didn't they come out with another version of Dune? Yes they did. And there's another one that's coming out soon. Um, but what quake one was, was these cool maps and you run around and shoot each other and you'd have these death matches, so one on one death matches and shoot rockets at each other and shit.

Speaker 3:          01:44:52       And it's, you're seeing it through your perspective. Like, so if you have a rocket launcher, you see the rocket launcher in front of you are there. Now that whole idea, what does this one, oh, this is quake champions. This is the newest version. I mean, the graphics are fucking incredible on these things. Now they, they're so excited. We're gonna have. We're setting up a land here, a local area network here. What we're going to stream live and play each other. Excellent and a waste massive amounts of time. And I'm sure I'm going to go bad sometimes I'm sorta like, oh, three hours just went going to go to sleep a little bit. Oh, well, whatever do it will suck up your time. It'll suck, but you know, I can't play. I'm just, I'm not good enough to play those kinds of things. Like it's just like spawn dice bond guy can figure out how to do it.

Speaker 3:          01:45:36       You're a smart guy. How dare you say that? You put the limitations on myself? Yeah, you can't do that. We just need to learn left wasd. Learn how to move your fingers around. The console's are bullshit. I. Lots of people say, I can't get any real accuracy with a console. That's your problem. How do you do with the finger? That type? I mean the console now. Good. I can send to you. How do you learn physics? How do you. What is that? All this fucking movie. We were like, you can do it, man. You can't. It's like rocky or something that's ready to karate kid or whatever. Hasn't been ever done that for video games. He's never been that movie where someone teaches someone how to play a video game nerd in the beginning and he's like a loser, but you know it comes back and it gets the girl. Well, one of the reasons why I wanted to talk to you about this in particular is because I am more and more convinced that it's our future may lie in some artificially created world and that people are more interested and more attracted everyday to virtual reality, augmented reality, virtual reality, and what can change. What was that game? That one game where there was a, you created worlds. I was going to pull that up earlier and ask. It's called no man's sky. Oh, I

Speaker 1:          01:46:50       played that. I played that. I bought it because of course any space game. I'm like whoring though it is because you know, they have 80 trillion worlds, but they're all this. They're basically, they don't look that different, you know. So it's like oatmeal, $80, million bottles

Speaker 2:          01:47:02       there. You go there and people are shooting each other and stealing money.

Speaker 1:          01:47:06       No, no. What is better for that kind? Yeah, right. I mean it's, you know, it looked like it was people, but what's better is I'm elite. Dangerous. So after this I was so disappointed in this, uh, I went back and I found a leap. Dangerous, which is disappointing because there was no action. Yeah, there was nothing. You just ran around and your mind stuff. It was sort of like, it just wasn't nothing exciting. There was nothing exciting. There was no, there was no, like I said, I don't usually play sort of these massive multiplayer games. So this is elite. Dangerous is elite. Dangerous end of this man. The trading or you know, you can decide like, oh I want to be a, I want to be a bounty hunter, you know? And it was so rich. I just, I spent. There was like a good six months of my life that I was working my way, getting better ships. I became because who doesn't want to be a bounty hunter? Right. You know what I'm saying? Like that's what everybody's and this just this game had you know, and there's like, I don't know, a few hundred thousand people in there. You're creating the universe. It's evolving. They add storylines. So you know, while we are setting up an htc vive here and we're, we. Danny was htc vive, how dare you. I know man. It's like, you know, you call your nerd, um, they will never not have sex in virtual reality.

Speaker 2:          01:48:15       It's, and it's consumer virtual reality when my friends never done the boy. Yeah, I know. I've been waiting. I've been sort of. Well, we tried to get one. Jamie went out yesterday and look, they're all sold out so we had to order one and so we're ordering one. We're going to have it set up in here. Um, and the, uh, the Games, I played the games of two years ago and I'm sure they're way more advanced than they are now. There's a crazy archery game where the, you're on the top of a castle and these little monsters that look like they could be in south park. They're not like detailed, right? Kinda cool looking monsters and you shoot out on with bows and arrows that are trying to invade the castle. But man, it's addictive because you really look down, you see them all around you. You have like a real.

Speaker 1:          01:48:57       So how did they know? Just always been my question about like, you know, I sit on my chair and I play my video game. So like our. Yes,

Speaker 2:          01:49:04       see this guy has a thing in his hands and he's moving around. This is like a star wars one and there's a bunch of different ones that I've always got to be standing. Right. In some sense. Yes. Do you want to just like sit down with a borrower and Ken, but there's also a boxing one that you get a real workout in. So it's a game and I played it over Duncan's house. We think there's a video of it, but it's weird because you punch wrong. So like, um, the like if I'm holding my hands like this, which is, I'm holding my hands vertically where my thumbs are up, right? The boxing gloves would be horizontal, like they would be if you were punching someone. So. So it doesn't do the turn. No, it's weird. So as you move your hands forward like this, which you really wouldn't punch like that,

Speaker 3:          01:49:48       the punches come out. So they've got an iron that I was going to say that'll be something that'll work out and that and make the, the controller rotate the way a fist would. But as you're doing it, you throw real punches and someone's throwing punches at you and when they throw punches you and they hit you, you see a white flash in front of you. That's good. Makes you nervous. Just like real sparring does. Well, you know. And so like this question of like, what are we going to do with virtual reality? Because like I said, you know, I already, you know, I see huge potential for like education in gaming and that's why we built our games. Yeah. Here's, this is me over Duncan's house. Just the one anybody to walk by. You know, I got to go get a beer. Bam. I'm beating this guy up.

Speaker 3:          01:50:26       Moving around them. See, that's the thing I've always wondered because that guy was fucking duck enough everyday. It's like, dude, how did you. I'm just like, move around, don't stand right in front of the rope a dope. Well, you gotTa, you gotTa have footwork and movement, but you can really get a workout with that. I'm not joking. You get exhausted and you know, you, you keep going and fight a tougher and tougher opponents. Well, you know, that's. And that's the way, you know. So like talk about haptic suits. Like eventually you know, you're going to wear things. I didn't see the, I read the book but I didn't see the uh, what was it? The movie ready? Set. Ready player one. I didn't see it either. I didn't see you. Have you ever read the book? The book's really good because the book is like full immersion.

Speaker 3:          01:51:08       Like the whole book is about like when virtual reality is it and so everybody has these suits that, you know and you're kind of in this ball, you play the game and so he can run and you know, um, but in some sense, yes, we're just starting out along these lines. Well, they have these places you can go that they have a warehouse set up and you go inside of it. And I went through one with my kids and it's a star wars one at Disneyland, Dude. It's fucking why you go across. You're walking across this platform like they have all these different places where you actually walk through and as you're walking through, you looked to the left and to the right and there's fire, but you feel the heat from the fire. It's fucking crazy. Like heater set up. So that blows up.

Speaker 3:          01:51:47       And Storm troopers start shooting at you. This is it right here. What is it called? The void. The void. Yeah. And um, you do this, I'm telling you man, this is better than any of the rides at Disneyland and it's just outside of Disneyland in downtown Disney. So you don't have to pay to get into get it. But it costs, I think it's $35 for a half an hour. It's not cheap, but it's not too bad. It's not too bad. Like it's fucking awesome. I mean it is awesome. So. So the question is what happens with the future, right? Because you have virtual reality. We're just on the cusp of, right? We're just beginning to like start playing around with these technologies because people have been saying it for years and it kind of sucked. It was sort of clunky. Well, we're, we're, we used to play Pong, right?

Speaker 3:          01:52:27       That's what I started with. I'm a 55. I'm 50, so I remember Pong. We were excited. I can't believe I'm controlling the TV, making the thing move on. The TV or asteroids flew the Star Wars game, I think it was called asteroids, but you flew through the trenches fucking wire frame, but it was amazing time. Dropped a lot of quarters. Sure. So go from that to what you were showing us here with these crazy new space games and then imagine what these mean. The Star Wars thing today. The void is really cool, but you know that it's not real, but it's cool, but you know, it's not real. Well, you're not going to be able to tell. It's not real and 20 years. Yeah. Right. And how much time are you spending suit, by the way when you do this? Oh really? You know, there's the pressure of you and you feel that when you getting shot, wow.

Speaker 3:          01:53:14       You feel like, you know, it's funny, even with the controller on my crappy ps four who, um, you know, when it vibrates, when you, to sort of give you, it's amazing how much the brain sort of picks up on these signals when you're using the htc vive and you draw the Arrow back. When it gets to the nocking point, you feel it like it's cool. You release is a feeling in your hand seeing the Arrow. It's really cool. Yeah. So what happens when, you know, right. I can be sort of like, you know, Grandpa, but like terrible people shouldn't be going out in nature, which I think they should be. They should, you know, now. Um, but, you know, I always, I'm always aware whenever I'm sort of like, oh shit, this is gonna be terrible. I always remember the whole you can see in like, I think at some point, socrates, 2000, five years, 500 years ago, it was like, Ooh, kids to do the robots.

Speaker 3:          01:53:58       That's all right. Um, so, you know, who knows what we'll do with it and you know, hopefully, you know, maybe it'll help, you know, maybe. I don't know, I don't want to be like, oh that's terrible, but there clearly are going to be dangerous with this. A different game. Jamie doesn't new one. Oh boy. I'm going to be fucked. The. Yeah, just the hands. Yeah. And so your, you have two little hand controllers and one of them would be the Arrow and the other one would be the bow and you were them and that's the haptic part in Italy. There's controllers on them. Well, you feel the Arrow vibrating against the riser of the blow as you draw it back to. It's really cool. Well it's funny because you know, we've talked about like, you know, for the game that we built, which was awesome.

Speaker 3:          01:54:40       It was really a lot of fun to actually go through the process of like, how do you know, how do you script it, how do you teach people, you know, like, because that whole thing that when we get into when you're a good game, right. You know, when the first couple hours of a game and you're just learning the basic stuff and you get excited like, oh, this is, this is a cool world to be in. Um, but I'd be interested to think sort of, you know, at some point to try vr for the same thing because what you want, you can have people be tacked on. They're not just sort of in their head, what else can you do to show to show them, teach them things you know, like glaciers or you know, mean. Sure. Well that's another thing in Disneyland, they have a thing called soaring over the world that you sit in a chair and you get raised up and there's a giant like imax style screen and it flies you over these environments. It's incredible. So beautiful. And you have different smells are in the air and the different places that you go to. Like when you go over the Allergan. Yeah, the elephants. You smell grass and hay. And um, I think that it's just a matter of time, like as we were talking about before, where biological entities might not be necessary for space travel, you might be able to send a robot put on a suit and be able to

Speaker 1:          01:55:43       experience these worlds like in real time. Yeah. Well, um, so, you know, you know, the simulation argument, maybe the philosophy arguing about the, you know, and so that's a really interesting idea. Should we just run through it for people who don't know it? So I forgot who it was. Nick Bostrom now, maybe not Brandon Carter, you know, there's this guy philosopher came with this brilliant argument for like why we're probably a simulate. We're probably somebody else's simulation self-aware simulation. And the idea is like, look, if you get one, you know, we've been talking about like civilizations when they get a million years ahead, what can they do that they're so powerful? They can build computers that can simulate reality, like fully simulate reality. We're like, you know, just like in the matrix, you have programs that are self aware and so, you know, once they get to that and they start running simulations in the world, right, it's cheaper to run.

Speaker 1:          01:56:29       It's cheap to run simulations. So they just run trillions of them. Right? So the idea is that from that argument there's more simulated realities then there is the one real reality. So odds are right, you know, if there's a trillion simulated realities in one real reality, you're probably in a simulated reality are we a, you know, everything like right now you, and I think this is real, you know, but what we are is an incredibly detailed and we are self aware programs in, you know, silicon matrix of, you know, uh, so that argument is brilliant. I mean, you know, just from the, just from the point of view of like numbers. Yeah, there's lots of reasons to say that's not possible but, but it's, you know, raises this issue of like, yeah, what is simulation? But if you were in a simulation, the whole matrix thing, if you were in a simulation that was that real, how would you know now how could you know they're going to be if you allow technology to continue, right?

Speaker 1:          01:57:22       If we keep moving forward at an exponential pace, there's gonna come a point in time where we have something that's indistinguishable from reality. So how do we know that we're not already in it? Once we're in it, will we create another reality? Will we continue to create simulations inside of simulations? So fractals, fractals exist in nature. They exist everywhere in the universe. And there's, there's also the argument that the atomic structure itself might really be a universe, right? Right. Yeah. Which is super standard talk. But you know, it's really. I mean, what, that's why I love science fiction, you know, the explorations of these ideas, you know, I mean they're way out there and there an exercises, exercises and there's a way in which again, when you think a million, 2 million years in the future, this is why I hate the loop this back to climate change, but just like God, if we could just make it through, who the fuck knows what we're going to be? Right? I mean there's the, there's the whole universe. One thing I did like about interstellar was the idea that like our future cells, which have now become integrated, the very fabric of reality, you know, that's how far you've evolved. You become the laws of physics that they're kind of opening up the wormhole for us. So, you know, a million years is so long as he knows what we can become and it's just like, you know, don't hold this back. I mean I'm, you know, I'm not a fan of the people that deny science,

Speaker 3:          01:58:42       but one thing I am a fan of is watching them do it. I like watching monkeys throw shit at the zoo, just something weird about watching people argue like really obvious, right wing talking points and, and, and most of them by the way, have no financial interest in climate change one way or the other. They're not, they're not the wealthy elite. There are these Weirdos that are like vampire familiars, like they want to be recognized as like an eight, an ally of the elite. They think somehow under that that's going to get. That's really what it is. Right? You know, and it's like, you know, and again it's the tribalism, but as you said, it's like watching them do this and the part that's so frustrating is just that like, dude, you're using science. It's not fair. Of course they're like, oh, you get like, you know, you get into an accident and you're like, Oh God, please give me the MRI.

Speaker 3:          01:59:32       And then, you know, as soon as your arm healed, you're going to be tweeting about how climate change is all bullshit. The earth is flat. Yeah, sure what to do with that. I mean, is this something we should pay attention to her? We should we just be like, okay, you know, fine, go ahead, do your thing. Isn't interesting. Conversation with Neil degrasse Tyson about it and he said one of the real problems with debating these people elevate their profile and they're never going to believe in the first place and the reality is there's a mental illness involved in a lot of these people to schizophrenia. There's something wrong with them. They believed this and then there's this. There's this massive lack of education and lack of reading. They're not interested in understanding how they know that the earth is round or how they know that every other planet in the solar system is round or how they know that every other planet that we've observed, all the stars are around why they're round, why it's a matter of mass and gravity and all these.

Speaker 3:          02:00:24       They don't care about all that, but what they don't want to think because the government as if it's the government is like one cabal. That's what it is. Equally minded people that are all working together to fuck you over somehow by convincing you that the earth is round. It is one of the dumbest things, but it's also a sign that we've created this world that's really easy to survive in. We've nerved all the hard edges and we keep the wolves off the streets and there's still these fucking dumb dumbs. Uh, and then they get online with computers, which is hilarious. Yeah. So these idiots did research, like what'd you looked at? A website like youtube videos. Two videos. Yeah, I mean it's, it's, it's kind of stunning. Yeah. Well actually, no. I think your point about actually we've made the world so safe because yeah, there's a certain way like it, you know, in a hunter gatherer or those people would be food. Those are the people who were standing there looking at the tiger being like, that's not a tiger. Yeah, exactly. So, uh, so and it's right. But what's weird about that? So that is like the, the, that like that is the dumbest shit you could possibly imagine. So, but oh, there's dumber. Oh Gosh. Dumber people think there's aliens underneath the earth and there's Reptilians a secret cabal of kid fuckers that run the world. And you made

Speaker 1:          02:01:40       a really excellent point, just admitted to go, right. Which is like the philosopher Karl popper once said, if there was a conspiracy, it failed. Right? The whole conspiracy thing is that like, oh yeah, everybody's in on it. Like, as if like, look, there are the powerful. They are the ones who control, you know, but they have their own agendas. They're beating the crap. That's the whole history of the world going after each other left and right. It's about finances. Right. And the idea that like, oh, somebody's gonna be able to keep this amazing secret, right. You know about the earth is flat and never. I mean, you know, it just, it gives people way more credit than you know, than, than they deserved. So you'd have to have everybody on the same page, all the different governments all over the world. They're all a lie about like where's the benefit in lying about the shape of the planet.

Speaker 1:          02:02:24       Right. Right down the man was making money. But, you know, here's what I, here's what's really messed up is that like, you know, climate change denial is just like a slightly less wackadoodle version of that, right? Because, you know, um, uh, there's a guy, writer, philosopher, uh, I forgot his name, Morton forgot his first name, but he talks about climate change being a hyper object, like, you know, that modern world. We have things that are hyper objects to me just so big that we just, we have a hard time wrapping our minds around them and that hyper objects, you know, if we're going to evolve, right, we're going to evolve new behaviors. One of them is the capacity to deal with hyper objects, but people want everything to be simple, you know, I mean, which cracks me up because they're fine with this being complex, you know, their cell phone can be complex because I like to use it.

Speaker 1:          02:03:08       But like, you know, the idea that like, you know, uh, the climate change, climate change, they, they need it. It freaks them out because it's too complicated or something. So they go for the simple answer, which is that it's a, it's a conspiracy, it's a hoax. I love this one. The scientists are all doing it for the money as if my pay was that good that, you know, I mean, I think a big issue happened with Al Gore when Al Gore came out with an inconvenient truth. Everybody connected Al Gore with the left, he's a Democrat and then they found out that he flies private jets and then like this motherfucker like this is all bullshit. And so there was enough. There's enough holes where they started poking through and then looking for conspiracies and then looking to deny the whole thing. I totally agree. I really wish, you know, I got nothing against Al Gore but.

Speaker 1:          02:03:53       But I wish he hadn't. I wish he didn't become the face of climate change because it just pushed. I mean I've only, you know, Neil degrasse Tyson or Sagan was still alive or you know, had done it. It would've been a totally different thing because it wouldn't have happened it off of it in an extreme way. Yeah. I mean, I don't know. I don't know what, but, but, you know, pull up this article, Al Gore may be the first, um, climate change billionaire or green billionaire that he's, he's made so much money doing these seminars and speeches and the film itself and they're doing this film, right? And then people, I think it actually came out. It didn't do that well. And then people in the amount of reading. I think. So I thought I saw Al Gore could be the world's first carbon billionaire, formerly vice president become the world's first carbon billionaire after investing heavily in green energy.

Speaker 1:          02:04:39       That's okay. That part's okay. Because if he's investing in these companies and the companies start making money, which like already so sure, solar employees, more people now than cold does. That's amazing. Well, coal, but that was one of the dumbest things. When, when trump became president, I got to bring back coal, like how about bring back knocking rocks together, start fires. It's like fuck man Cole. It's as if the typewriter companies got together and made sure you never bought a computer. Like we're going to computers illegal because you got to keep using typewriters. Fucking terrible anymore. It's like, you know, it's just, but listen, I got it. One thing that you always got acknowledged is that like this, you know, when you change infrastructure is people are going to get hurt. You know what I mean? Like I mean for those coal miners, man, that's what they've done their whole life.

Speaker 1:          02:05:23       It's been an honorable fucking thing and they've, you know, so you can't just sort of be like, hey, we're switching infrastructure. See Ya. You know, there's gotta be some deep understanding of, of, of navigate have consequences and helping people who are going to be, you know, put, you know, train them how to put up solar, you know, solar panel. How do you feel about universal basic income? Have you ever looked into. Yeah, yeah, no, no, I've thought about that a lot. You know, it's a big thought and consideration when it comes to automation technology and you know, with the automation thing, it's so true, right? Because you know, when you think about what's been going on with the last election, you know, and everybody was like, oh, you know, like you know what's happening with blue collar people workers, which is totally true, but like man, it's not China, it's automation.

Speaker 1:          02:06:04       Right? And that's what really is going to screw up the whole nature of work, you know, for everybody from truck drivers, you know, even to meet a university professors is we got this, the Ai, you have the automation coming on and write what do you do? What are you doing here as a university professor? Is One day going to be retro that kids are going to want to learn online, they're going to want to learn through some sort of an interactive course so that you can get on your phone rather than go to an actual physical place. It's possible, you know, I mean it's possible, but I think, and this is going to be the whole question with the new economy or whatever, whatever happens, whatever we're moving into is finding those places where, you know what, I don't want a machine, right? I mean, so right now like, so when the, what is it, the moocs came out the massively online courses, you know, that was like five years ago.

Speaker 1:          02:06:46       Once I catch it, universities are done and everybody's going to take these online courses and it never happened. You know, because people want to be together. They want to learn, they want the experience of happy, you know, my part of my students, it's not just lecturing them, agree, lecture. My students are probably. I bet you are man, you're a good talker. I had one student say, I, you know, the, the, the reviews you get at the end, the guy said, hey, I hate to say this, but you know, you should make those tapes for people to go to sleep because every class your voice. And He meant it in a nice way. He's like, you have a nice voice that's passive aggressive. So, uh, fuck whoever is, um, I think that, uh, I think people will always, with education, there'll be some component of it that, yeah, sure you can learn it online.

Speaker 1:          02:07:27       Went to, but I think like, you know, we're going to have to, they'll, there'll be, there'll be a place for like people coming in and like learning in groups and somebody who has spent their whole life studying the thing, telling you, you know, what's going on, right? Like there's a lot of things were like, and we've lost a lot of this. I'm a mentorship or apprenticeship, right. There's a lot of things she needed. Somebody who knows, you know, who spent their whole life going, oh, you know, you crank it this way. Not that way because you got to get that way. It'll never work. You know, you can't learn that from watching a video or something. Well, there's certain things. A martial arts, which is a big part of my life. You have to learn from a person can, you got to have tiny things that they must show you while you're doing it, but you can learn a lot of things from videos.

Speaker 1:          02:08:07       No doubt. Yeah. There's a lot of things that people are putting up online, instructional courses and stuff and I use some of them, you know, if I have to fix my sink and we're all going. Oh, for sure man. Yeah. It's kind of amazing, you know, so, you know, I think like with everything, so we'll circle back to the UBI. Um, you know, like with everything we're going to have to invent new ways. We will because we're just human beings. Like there's a way in which we're going to find, you know, niche places that there will be economies where people make things. But yeah, in the end, I mean ubi may be necessary. I think it may really be necessary because if there's no work, you know, I mean that's a recipe for disaster for your democratic society. Know. Yeah. Just hope we can move past this idea that everybody who needs that as some sort of a welfare brat.

Speaker 1:          02:08:54       Yeah. Right, right. Well, you know, once there's no work at all, I mean they're good because like, you know, this is the thing that I like with a self driving cars. Right. So I asked this question a lot and I've written about this sort of like, okay, everyone's like, we got to have self driving cars, we're heading toward self driving cars, self driving cars will destroy the last good blue collar job in America, you know, truck driving. Right? And that's a really good livelihood for a lot of people. And it's like, oh, we're just gonna eliminate it. It's like, why do we have to like, okay, yeah, there's, you're telling me there's got to safety sake. That's what they say, right? But in total it's not entirely clear, right. You know that, that, that will work. And I, you know, what are the for the, for the lives that are lost in the driving, I mean, you know, you know, the car crashes, is that going to be worth the social upheaval that comes from not having any work anymore?

Speaker 1:          02:09:42       So I mean just like they're these huge bearing down on us. If it's your friend or your mom or. I loved ones. Yeah. But these are the kind of calculus. I mean, you know, if, if it tears down, if the, if wiping out these jobs destroys democracy, right. And you end up with really though that doesn't seem possible. I just think that what it's gonna do is gonna make travel safer and then we have to figure out, well these jobs that people got from traveling, how do we replace that? That income. Right? Well, one of the things is we're going to, we're going to have to start teaching kids to be creative. Yeah. That's the niche that I think there's going to be places where like the now you'll have. So listen, I'm not arguing that we shouldn't have. No, I know you're not just being, you're just looking at all the variables. Yeah. And I'm asking like the CA, you know, we're moving so rapidly into this new world, right? That like who's deciding for us, who's deciding

Speaker 3:          02:10:33       that we want cars and we're told that we're going to get it. But like a lot of these things I think there, you know, there needs to be a little bit more dialogue, democracy rights and having this stuff shoved down our throats and told like it's the best thing ever, you know? Well, you know, how about Cell Towers? They're fucking everywhere. I mean there's no getting away from it if you could. I mean, is there a community anywhere that has made some sort of an agreement? Will there be no cell towers in our community? No. But there are communities that have decided to, like in the southwest that no lights, no lights at night. That's amazing because they wanted to preserve their nights guy. We should really have some sort of a day where everybody shuts everything off, sees the sky and see how crazy it is that we live in this weird state where we're on an organic spaceship flying through infinity and we don't see that.

Speaker 3:          02:11:22       Right. Because, you know, if you're wanting to do backpacking or something, you're in the back country, you know, a couple of days. You notice things changing like Oh, the mood's not as quite. Yes. And so nobody looks up now on your right because there's nothing to see because you don't see anything because the light pollution. I went to the Keck observatory and the big island. Have you been? I've never been. I'm a theorist. I don't do it out. Nobody's going to get me close to a telescope. Could fucking just. You don't even have to go all the way to the observatory. The visitor station, which is, I forget where it's at. I think it's 14 or 12 or something like that. It's really high. Right. But there's. They have diffused lighting, all of the big island. So there's no light pollution and when you look up it is just stunning, right?

Speaker 3:          02:11:58       You look up your leg the Milky Way, right. And most people have never seen the milky way right there. Look, I thought you have to have a telescope to see out. No, it's right there. And you feel like you're flying through space and you have this, this really humble feeling that I think people get into a couple of different places. People get when they live next to mountains, they get it when they live next to the ocean, but you really get it. If you could see space, and I think one of the things that is haunting the human race is the arrogance of humans, which is compounded by the fact that we can't see the cosmos, that we only see what's in front of us, so this is the world that we live in. We put a roof over our head. This is the box. I've got my blinders on.

Speaker 3:          02:12:38       I'm moving ahead because I want a new lexus or whatever, you know, whatever it is, whatever material thing you're trying to possess when this, this unstoppable force in front of. When you look up and you see the cosmos, it's like it's an undeniable reality and you go, oh, okay, okay. This is just a small thing. My existence is just a small thing in this mystery, this giant mystery of what we just found out 20 years ago. There's plant itself, right? I mean, this is a giant mystery. You're looking up at a hundred billion stars in this galaxy alone. Man, I couldn't. You're speaking my language, I mean the, you know, the loss and the myth that the capital m word, right? So I'm a scientist, I'm an atheist, but I believe in mystery. I believe that that kind of at the core of our lives, it's just, I wake up everyday to forget here and I'm not going to, I'm going to be here until I die and then I have no idea what the hell happens. So, you know, and the, as you said, like mountain mountains in particular, you know, I would think for mountains,

Speaker 1:          02:13:32       um, the, the night sky is, it reminds you, it opens that space up, right. You know, when you're sort of like, you know, and you're right, you can, you know, we can talk about it or you can, you talk about it, but it's really, it's an experience. It's the experience that just shows you your part of this. It's more than you put your, you're here and you know, and I think, right, a lot of the stupidity of the modern age, you know, as you said, the consumer is in particular. All that matters to me is getting my next pile of shit. Um, when you're out there, you realize who cares, you know, who freaking cares, like, you know, for a moment even you just get the sense of that mystery and it can be transformative. You know,

Speaker 2:          02:14:08       I think what's happening is we've created these civilizations as civilizations need to be lit up. The lights keep us from seeing the universe. The universe humbles us, so we're not humbled. Then we moved towards acquiring physical possessions, material objects because we think that that's going to make us happy and our entire society is geared towards innovation because everybody wants the newest shiny shit that is, that is what's leading us to artificial life and that all this shiny shit is all innovation and it's eventually going to move to this one singularity. And that singularity is some new being.

Speaker 1:          02:14:44       Yeah. So it's funny because, you know, one thing when I think about like all these other, you know, my, my argument, all these other civilizations is that, you know, whether or not you make it maybe that the evolutionary heritage you get, right? So we evolved from, you know, both chimpanzees or the chimpanzee ancestor in the Bonobo ancestor. So we've got like, we fight, we're hierarchical, very hierarchical, right? Um, so, you know, we've got a lot of aggression this, but we also got the vanilla both kind of like this, just have sex, everything's cool. So we're like, we're sort of, we've got this really weird mixed evolutionary baggage and whether or not you can make it to the next side with the existential challenge of trigger and climate change is kind of like a, what your evolution evolution gave you, you know, because you can imagine species like hive minds, you know, if you came from termite and intelligent termite species, it might be a lot easier to deal with climate change.

Speaker 1:          02:15:29       You're like everybody, you know, get on the, you know, uh, get on the, get on the courts. Um, but uh, most essentially is, can you evolve new behaviors, right? So we've been on this track and it's leading us in a way that, as you said, you were, it's like the shiny thing dangling in front of us is leading us off on this one track. And the question is, can we evolve new behaviors, which I actually am going to say this, I think they're, part of it is spiritual, you know, or at least in my atheist way of reconnecting with mystery to see like, uh, you know, we're part of this and we need to respect it. And you know what, when you say spiritual, what do you mean? So in my first book was about science and religion. You know, I'm an atheist, but I'm not Richard Dawkins atheist. I think that whole idea is the difference. Well, you know, Richard Dawkins is what I would call a strident atheist and he's like, Yo, anybody who has any spiritual or any, you know, any inclination towards mystery is an idiot, you know, and she needs to do LSD, right? In sf or Dmt,

Speaker 2:          02:16:25       robin or something that just gives you an experience

Speaker 1:          02:16:30       of mystery. Right. Exactly. You know, so I've been doing zen meditation for like the last 30 years, you know, and like, you know, so I've been staring at a wall for 30 years and the first thing you learn is it's really boring. And then the second thing you learned is that their stuff onto your thoughts. You are not just the shit you're thinking, you know, there's just sort of settled down and there's just like this openness, you know. And so, um, the spiritual part, it's like you said, you know, when you're in the mountains, right? So I love doing back country hiking and union. When you get above tree line, there's that weird thing that happens when you're above tree line and just like, you know, you got this panorama around you and that thing is, you know, the earth, right, of which we are part and you know, so this is an interesting question about how can virtual reality do this or do you actually need to get out there and kind of think you need to get out there.

Speaker 1:          02:17:12       But maybe virtual reality can give people the impetus to get out there. You know? Well, it'll be a different experience. I don't think there's anything wrong with the virtual reality experience of being in the mountains. I think it'd probably be pretty fucking cool, but it's not going to be being in the mountains. Something about being in the mountains is also, there's a, there's a weird feeling, and I don't know if it's real, but there's a weird feeling that there's no signal out there in the places where there's no cell signal. There's no. There's a feeling you get when you are absolutely not connected. Yeah. And then you see wildlife and the wildlife out there. They're almost like these mystical beings, like when you see a deer step out of the tree line and it's like Hashtag. Yeah. That thing has been that way for a million years.

Speaker 1:          02:17:53       That's that species has not changed at all in a million years. And the signal what you talk about the signal lights, it's really the thing is what for me it's like when I get far enough back that I know that there's just not another human being, you know, this just like when I leave this exact, it's going to still be happening. Like it's doesn't give a shit about you and it's just moving along and as you say, it's been moving this way for millions of years and you just realized like. And that's why, you know, part of the thing I'm saying with the book is that like, look, if we trigger climate change, that's just the earth way of like creating the next set, you know, it used us to create climate change to, you know, now move onto something else because that's what the earth does. It's just this animal power, you know, and when you're out there you feel that, um, you know, on the thing that I think we need to do is sort of, we established our connection to that were part of that were from that we're not evil, we're not bad.

Speaker 1:          02:18:43       We need to reintegrate ourselves in a way that we still get our civilization. But you can. That's what I mean. So you ask why spiritual? Because when we connect to that mystery, then we're in a better place to make the right decisions to understand what the decisions are. If not, we're like, oh, we've got to save the polar bears and we're not looking at. No, no. It's the biosphere as a whole that we have to understand well, operating out of ego and ideology and not out of rational thought with all the information at our disposal and really verifying that information for understanding what's correct and what's not correct and whether or not there's bias behind it or scientific research that was funded by people that have a vested interest in it leaning one way or the other. Right. All that stuff is very, very slippery, very dangerous, and when you find out that studies have been influenced, special

Speaker 3:          02:19:28       interest groups or lobbyists or whatever and that they, you know, like especially pharmaceutical studies of the creepiest where they, they can do a series of studies and only one of them show some sort of a positive impact for whatever weird reason and that's the one they use and they don't have to publish the fact that they ran a hundred fucking studies. Right. Do it. I try and teach people. I'm sorry, go ahead. No, no, go ahead. Yeah, I think the most important thing that people need to understand about science, it's not so much sciences results, but how science works, you know, because it does work, right. That's why we have all this stuff and so, so they can distinguish. So I, you know, I say that science is three things. It's spitballs supertankers and stadiums, right? You know, the problem with the news, there'll be like the latest study shows the color red, you know, will make you have better sex.

Speaker 3:          02:20:11       It's like, you know, then it lets the latest study that can get you to click on that USA today or the media reports. It's as if this was science, like every day a whole bunch of new articles come out. You know, I write scientific articles, that's the currency of my profession, but like one study is, is just like, it's a spitball, right? It's like basically we're shooting spitballs at each other, but science is like a super tanker, right. You know, we're like, it takes seven miles to turn a super tanker around. That's what really science is the things that we think we deeply understand. Science is like the super tanker and people are shooting spitballs at the papers every day and if you get enough spit balls on one side of the, you know, the prow or whatever it starts to turn it right. So the science will turn slowly if enough of the spit balls are lined up.

Speaker 3:          02:20:55       So people, you know, it's not about the single study, it's about have there been 300 studies over the last 30 years that say the same thing? So like, yeah, the coffee stuff, coffee's good. Coffee's bad. Clearly the fact that we keep getting both answers means we don't know. That's all we don't know yet. It's just not clear. Climate change 30. Not even 30 years. A hundred years of the same results. Yeah, we got that. You know, well there's always a problem with diet in that you're not taking into account how nutrients interact with other foods or different foods interact with foods and different. You know, you know, when you say coffee's bad. Okay. Was it bad when you're smoking cigarettes are bad when you're eating grass fed meat or bad when you're on a Vegan diet or when is it bad? Right, right. Who are these people and what are they putting in their system and how much sugar are they taking in and how much sodium and you know, what, what's the nutrient levels, their blood.

Speaker 3:          02:21:41       Did you test them for b12 deficiencies and all these different things. Like that's the real problem with any dietary studies. They don't take into account the extremely varied diet of and the complexity of the system. Right. So that's, I mean, so I would tell people that like, you know, when it comes to like health sciences, anything in general about human beings. Look, this stuff is really complex and as you said, there's a thousand different things that can interact. So you gotta really take that stuff with a grain of salt. Like okay, does smoking cause cancer? Yeah. Got that. You know. But like yeah, it's coffee, good or bad. We just, the studies aren't there yet, but that's different from climate change or you know, a gravity, you know, or is there an round? Yeah. Yeah. Those are, those are stupid. So I'm. Listen man, thank you very much for being here.

Speaker 3:          02:22:23       I really, really appreciate. It was really good to talk to you. Is Fun. Do you have an audio book out? A. Yeah, there is an audio book. Did you read it? I have not read. Did I read that you read the words that are in the audio book version? Did you, were you narrating it? No. No I didn't. God dammit. Sorry. That they didn't talk. Man. Did they have been really animated and I hate that when I really. When I buy audio books and I know that the guy who's reading it doesn't have a fucking single bone in invested in this idea that he's saying he's just repeating the words. Well the guy, I'm sure whoever did it was like, you know, totally channeling. I must've felt it in the astral plane. You'd be better if you read it, man. They should have let you do it.

Speaker 3:          02:23:06       Why the fuck didn't they let you do? Just don't push for it. Oh No, I didn't even know. You know that part of the. No, I didn't. I didn't understand. Part of the publishing. Tell people the title again, a light of the stars. Alien worlds and the fate of the earth. Don. Don, Don, Don, Don, your twitter is Adam Frank for why? Four? Because that's the only one. Everything else was taken. So I was just like, I got to come up with a six years ago when I got on Adam Frank for. And do you have an instagram as well? No, no. I have a facebook author page and website. A website is Adam Frank Science. I think if you just Google Adam Frank. Thank you Adam. We really appreciate it. So much fun. Really Fun. Bye.
