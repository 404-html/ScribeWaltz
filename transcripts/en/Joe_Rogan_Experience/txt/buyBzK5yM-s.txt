Speaker 1:          00:00:00       We gotta figure out a way to make it so we just have a white hole, one button thing where everything syncs up with one button to so possible one day maybe. We live right now with live, live, live. How are you sir? Yeah, not too bad. Welcome. Thanks for coming man. Appreciate it. Yeah, no worries. Thanks so much for having me. Sam Harris is going to be with us, but he flaked out last minute. He's busy, man. Yeah, he's a busy man. I'm so. I'm, I'm, I'm interested to talk to you about a bunch of things, but one of the big ones is this idea of effective altruism and this is something that you really promote to the point where, I don't know if this is true, but I read this about you, that everything that you make over $36,000 a year, you donate. Yeah, that's right.

Speaker 1:          00:00:40       So wow. Yeah. So everything above, technically it's anything above 20,000 pounds from 2009 Oxford, so just inflation, cost of living changes and stuff, but that's about $36,000. So you've just sort of decided that, which is by the way, the one percent for the whole world? Yeah. Not quite two percent. Yeah. I'll be in the top, still be in the top two percent. Even despite that, it was 34,000. I think $34,000 puts you in a top one percent. I think it's $55,000. That was a change and maybe since trump's been in office, but it's a, it's, you know, what you're doing is, uh, if that's the case, that's a, that's a very charitable thing. Yeah. And it's also, I mean it's most of my income over the course of my life, like especially as an academic, you know, going to an tons though, since the effect of altruism blew up, you end up getting things like speaking fees and give all that away as well.

Speaker 1:          00:01:35       It's going to end up probably being the large majority of income, of course, of my life. Do you ever like want to buy something and be like, shit, if I wasn't so goddamn generous I'd be able to get this. You know, I never do. I like basically never think that, yeah, I think like this, like I feel like in contemporary society we just get bombarded with marketing stuff all the time saying like, oh, you really need this thing if you're going to have a good life. And I think like an almost every case, that's just not true. I think the psychological evidence just shows that once you go above a certain level of income, um, additional money just has a very small impact on your happiness. And in my own case, like the things that make me happy. I like being surrounded by friends. That's the gym membership, that's like $40 a month or something.

Speaker 1:          00:02:20       It's not very much I can afford that. Being able to work and you know, why I really am passionate about and I already have that. So my life is just so good in so many ways and I feel like there's so much of a focus on money and how money is the key to happiness and it's just, I think it's just all bullshit basically what's definitely some bullshit in it. And I, I see that a lot in my neighborhood because I live where white people go to breed and they, they, they go to breed and they, they sit down and they just talk about things. They talk about Range Rovers and certain watches and certain purses and shoes and yeah. And it becomes this constant. The amazing thing is just how you adapt. So it's called the hedonic treadmill. The richer you are, the richer you need to be.

Speaker 1:          00:03:05       Oh yeah. So I was once part of a conversation, um, I was going to give a talk and um, I was going to like a family and was on the kind of the private jet in fact. And the conversation was discussion of different private jets in which private jets are better than so. And this other person has this really nice private jet and it just means that like at no stage do you ever lose the like, oh, I could just have this nicer thing. No, because you can get to the point where you want a jumbo jet, like one of those Quantas air buses and house. Yeah. I mean, I'm sure that one of those Richard Branson type character characters probably has something like that. Yeah, that's totally. It seems to get to this. You hit this critical mass stage where you, you know, like these billionaire characters where they start buying $100,000,000 yachts, $400,000,000 yachts and what is the most expensive Yada believe it's a half a billion dollars or more incredible.

Speaker 1:          00:04:00       Yeah. You need to have a staff to take care of it the whole time. And if it ever. The thing is, I think if I had a car that would make my life worse because not only to be stressing about this, like what if it gets damaged? Like I feel bad that I'm not using it. Yeah. Yeah. I would imagine. And less. Well I guess not though, because if you look at this, oh Jesus Christ, it's a billion billion dollars in a year. The streets of Monaco is what it's called and it is $1,000,000,000. Go to that thing. Oh, that's it. Oh my God. It's a, it's a neighborhood. I think some floating neighborhood. I think on all of these things, you should have the place, the cost with how many bed nets you could buy for children in sub Saharan Africa. Oh, well that's just ridiculous. Hold on. Go up one once a one point 2 billion.

Speaker 1:          00:04:48       Scroll up. Estimated price. Oh my God. The eclipse. Oh, forefront. 50 million to one point. $2 billion. That's like when you go to get it made and you go like, how much is it going to cost me? And like, between four $50 million and one point $2 billion. You're like, oh, you know, normal, normal shit. Fucking change. That is fucking insane. Look at that God damn thing. I mean that. It's the. Oh it's a replica of the Monaco Grand Prix track. Oh my God. That's insane. So you can drive around on your yacht at a ridiculous rate of speed. So this guy probably has like a Ferrari. They go all over the surface of his crazy yacht. Okay, let's get a fake beach. But it hasn't been sold yet. Oh, it doesn't actually owned yet, I don't think. Oh, okay. Interesting. Who buys that? They're going to get love attention where there are enough people.

Speaker 1:          00:05:46       There's a bunch of those people. I mean, I don't want anyone to billion. That's probably. There's only a couple of thousand people in the world who are worth that much. Really? Yeah. If somebody's willing to sink the whole fortunate. How many billionaires do you think there are worldwide? Let's guess he and a half thousand dollars million. There's three and a half thousand dollars. You're. You sound very confident. I think it's about that. Yeah. Oh, that's, that's a large number. That is kind of crazy. Three and a half thousand people that have more than $100. Million dollars and here's a whole will macaskill at over 35,000. Cuts it off, but then half of that 1800, 1800 people. Oh, you're happy. Glad we've got. Well, no, I'm just happy we've got fact. Check it on. Connected health statistics. That's a lot of money, man, but it is one of those weird things where I do not think that money equates to happen.

Speaker 1:          00:06:36       One of the things that money does do is it alleviates the stress of bills, but a lot of those stress of bills can be alleviated by not buying as many things. Right. So like a lot of the stress of bills that people have is sort of self imposed stress. Like you get a mortgage for a very large house, you have car payments, you have all these different things that you're paying for. So that kind of money stress that some people put themselves under is actually not really necessary. Right. So if you broke it down to what do you actually need, just need a nice place to live where it's not crime Britain and it's safe. You need a bed. What else do you need? Food. You need food. Exercise. You one of those. No TV dudes. Do you have a tail? Well, I watched Netflix.

Speaker 1:          00:07:16       I just finished veep, which I love. Is it good? Yeah, it gets better. The first season's on so good, but they don't have that kind of patience. Seasons. Oh yeah. I just got addicted. Even if I want something and I think it's awful, I still just. I will get addicted right away. I have to watch olefins. Yeah. I've liked the most compulsive personality. Have you seen house of cards? I have not seen a deliberately. Not Stock Show. Yeah. That's a good show. Like game of thrones makes my life worse. I like hate it really. I think it's amazing television, but I find it to so distressing because you still have to watch it all the time. Why do you find it distressing? Just like the violence, the violence, people's gang. The heads popped and stung. Oh, that one with the mountain? Yeah. That's the one that really stays with me.

Speaker 1:          00:08:00       That's rough. Yeah. I'm, I'm. It gives me a lot of anxiety because I know there's only two seasons left and the next season is one coming up. It's only seven episodes and the final season is only six. I'm so happy about that. It's like it's not making me happy. Well, I'm not very happy about that at all. It's like someone saying they're going to stop selling heroin or something. I'm like, yeah, I'm going to have to get hooked on Oxycontin and that's what I feel I'm going to have to watch the whole season all over again or the whole series. Um, so you have a television, you have a computer. I'm sure you have the computer. Yeah. Um, yeah, I like moving around two tons, so I normally, like I don't have a house, but it wouldn't be convenient type of house because I'm traveling so much to you.

Speaker 1:          00:08:40       Brenda apartment or something and had an apartment. You live in England? I live in oaks most of the time. I spent quite a chunk of my time out in the bay area. I'm like significant part of our staff and the nonprofits out there. I've got lots of contacts still the organizations about that. So most of your time you, it seems like you're spending working for charitable organizations or. Yeah, so I have kind of three hats. So one is an academic, so I'm the festival oxides. Second is this kind of more public figure whether I'm talking about these ideas through books or on this podcast and so on. And then third is I run a nonprofit called the center for effective altruism, which is more about like finding the best charities, the ones that doing the most good is going to help other people the most and kind of promote them and try and get people to give more and to give more effectively.

Speaker 1:          00:09:26       Yeah. We've gone over ineffective charities or I shouldn't say ineffective, but charities that are the way they're structured, when you look at how much money is actually going towards the charity itself and how much is going towards the structure of the organization, it's kind of crazy. Yeah, I mean I think so that's normally the focus of ineffective cavities is on like, yeah, how much is spent on overheads. But I actually think that's not the most important thing. The most important thing is what's the charity actually doing? Like what's the actual program? So one chata tea for the example that I'm sure you'll find funny as a chatbot, skilled homeopaths without borders and it goes to Haiti and particularly on disobedience like homeopathic calamities, um, you know, which don't work, they don't provide any health benefit. And even if at a zero percent overhead cost, so apps like spent nothing, everything was volunteers.

Speaker 1:          00:10:17       It would still be bad child teach. Those shouldn't be given to that Chata tea. This one I didn't know that that one existed. Yeah. Yeah. It's kind of small, but I would imagine phil, thankfully homeopaths without Borders God. But then there's some super effective charities like paradigm that's saving a life with flt three and a half thousand dollars, like the against malaria foundation. Even if they were spending a bunch on investigating what are the best areas to focus on or like paying of that stuff more. If what you should just care about is how much money you're putting in and what you're getting is an outcome. Right? Well, I think it's impossible for everyone to. It's impossible for you to give $10 and all $10 is going to go directly to the charity because there's got to be overhead, there's got to be infrastructure, there's got to be a bunch of people working there, rent costs.

Speaker 1:          00:11:08       But the question is, at what point does it become kind of a scam? Because there are most certainly some organizations that appear to be charitable organizations but are really kind of a scam. Yeah, there's definitely some. So like the kid's wish network, for example, kind of like the make a wish foundation, similar idea. And they spent 99 percent of their budget on fundraising. So they were just like this kind of chatter Ponzi scheme basically. So they spend all their money on fundraising itself. Yeah. To then invest in more fundraising and one percent somehow or another gets out there. Yeah. What does that. Maybe it's not as high as 99 percent is above 90 percent or something crazy. So what does that money get to? Like what do they do with the actual money itself? And then the idea that was

Speaker 2:          00:11:53       granting wishes for sick children. Um, so, uh, do you remember the San Francisco thing with back kid? It was like, a bit like there was a big event, lots of publicity around this kid, a child that had some strange disorder. Yeah. So, um, the child, I don't know the details. I think the child had leukemia. They have wished was that they wanted to be Batman for the day. [inaudible] this is a different thing. Yeah. Okay, cool. So they like the make a wish foundation set up. This um, you know, amazing store. They were, they got to kind of drive and a batmobile and like have this a fantastic day with it. Basically Batman for the day kids which network is doing basically the same thing. They find seriously sick kids often terminally ill kids and say what one thing would you want? And we'll make it happen. But at the, I think the but there is a lot of focus on like particularly bad charities, you know, the ones that really come up too is completely dysfunctional.

Speaker 2:          00:12:46       But I think that's not actually the most important message. What's most important is just even among the charities that kind of good, even the ones that are making a difference, there's still a vast difference in the impact that you have difference of hundreds of thousands of times between the penalties that are merely good and there's ones that are really the very best and that's by mainly dependent on what program are they focusing on. So what is there any charity that people should avoid spending their money on? Like are there other charities that you feel like are just so ridiculously ineffective? Like, yeah, I mean like the ones we mentioned of kids who wished network or homeopaths without borders. I'm the borders. This is ridiculous. It's like food. Who on parade? Just stop. Yeah, I mean there was another one. I can't remember that but it does.

Speaker 2:          00:13:31       I'm a strategy without limits and with that limit. No, it does. I'm dolphin therapy for autistic children which has no evidence of working, um, but does actually just have some, like the risk of the children's learning. So yeah, so you can like chatty pick these examples. But the thing is that these aren't just like not really representative in general. I think charities doing good. Um, but the question is just like in the same way as if you're buying a product for yourself, you don't just want to get like, you know, a laptop as long as it's work. So you want to find like what's the best laptop I can get with my money? Or if you're investing you want to not just get like an okay to turn. You want to say, well what's the best to the attorney can get. Right. So in that sense, I think like the number of charities that you think is just, yeah, this is literally competing for being the most effective charity in the world.

Speaker 2:          00:14:20       That's actually fairly small. So givewell for the examples a evaluates it looks all sorts of different global health and global development charities and it's less of charities that's like, yeah, this is super good. You should literally be donating to them. It's only seven charities long at the moment. Mine is up from last year when it was only for travel to wow. Seven charities. That of how, I mean, what is the overall total of act of charities? It's got to be in the thousands, hundreds of thousands, I'm sure. What got you involved in this? So you're a young, you seem like you should be playing video games and skateboarding or something. I spent a lot of my teenage years playing video games. Yeah, it was, again, compulsive personality. I need the band myself from doing it. So you're compulsive personalities now going towards good things. Yeah, I manage the key was managing my life so that the things I get really focused on addicted.

Speaker 2:          00:15:11       I'm addicted to good things than bad. Um, so yeah, it all started back in. So I was back in high school. I'm kind of undergraduate of being very convinced by the arguments that this philosopher, Peter Singer, oh, I know Peter Singer, he's like a radical animal rights activist. He has. Yeah. He has a few things. Um, and he had this argument, which is that, you know, the way I tell the story is, imagine I'm someone walks is walking past a shallow pond and they see a child drowning in that shallow pond and they could run in and they could save the child. Butler willing a really nice suit suit the costs like $3,000. And so they say, no, I'm not going to save that child. I'm just going to walk by and let it down because I don't want to lose the cost of this suit. I normally say, look in moral philosophy, we have a technical term for people like that they called assholes.

Speaker 2:          00:16:07       And uh, the, this is how I convey it in my seminars. Um, and obviously we all agree like, yeah, come on, if it's just, you could clearly save this child, it's light in front of you. You ought to do that. The cost of $30,000 does not count. But then what Peter Singer's insight is it says, well, what's the difference between that child? It's right there in front of you and that child that's in Subsaharan Africa who you could save, you'll never meet them for sure. Um, but you could still save their life with just a few thousand dollars if you donate it to a barely effective nonprofit and he considers all the different ways in which these cases might be just analogous but decides ultimately like, no, there's actually just know morally relevant difference. And so yeah, we do just have an obligation to give away at least a very significant proportion of our income.

Speaker 2:          00:16:56       And I was really convinced by this kind of on an intellectual level for many years, but I never really did anything about it. Uh, and not until I went to Oxford to do a postgraduate degree in philosophy. And in the summer between that I needed some money. I worked as a fundraiser for care international global development charity. So I was one of those annoying people in the street who had kind of passed the light, can get in your way and then ask you to donate $10 a month. And it meant the all day. Every day. I was talking about like, look, this is the conditions of people in extreme poverty, we can do so much to help people at such little cost to ourselves, you know, why are we not doing this? And I was just over and over again kind of getting these apathetic responses and I was just getting so frustrated because I just thought, look, these people just not living up to their own values.

Speaker 2:          00:17:43       People killingly do Claire Care, but there's some sort of block going on. And then I thought, well, I'm going to do philosophy. At the time I was planning to do like philosophy of language, logic, very esoteric stuff. And so I thought, well, I'm not living up to my own values. Um, I should really try and make a change. And so I went to Oxford and I started asking a whole bunch of different kind of academics or what, what's the impact of your work? What kind of difference have you made? And normally they were like, I'm not really in it to make an impact. I just got interested in these ideas and that was pretty disheartening. But I kept persisting until I met another postgraduate student called Toby Ord, and he just blew me away because he had also been convinced by these ideas, but he'd gone one step further and he'd said, Yep, I've made a commitment to give away almost all of my income of the course of my life, about million pounds.

Speaker 2:          00:18:32       At the time, he was living on 9,000 pounds, saving 2000 pounds and donating 2000 pounds. So he was like, well, really hardcore the thing as well as actually taking these ideas and putting into practice what really blew me away was just how positive he was. And he was. It was not the. He was kind of wearing his hair shirt flagellating instead he was saying, look, this is an amazing way to live. We have this amazing opportunity to do a huge amount of goods to help so many other people, thousands of people. It's actually a very low cost to ourselves. And me having that one person who also kind of shared my worldview, shared my ambitions, just meant kind of gave that little psychological block was lifted. And it meant that I was like, okay, cool, I'm on board first, I can a committed 10 percent.

Speaker 2:          00:19:19       Then I was like, no, actually I think I can do this for the pledge. Um, and then that meant I had this question of, well, I'm planning to give awake, come like million pounds over the course of my life. Where should that money go? You know, I want to make sure it has as big an impact as possible. And that meant I started digging into, well how can we compare the between different charities? I found there was a ton of work for them, health and development economics that could help us to answer this. And what began as this kind of side project between these two, you know, ivory tower, academics, me and toby, we found that loads of people, just Lee, I'm taken by this idea both of giving more but in particular have given more effectively. And over time, this kind of global movement called effective altruism start to form around these ideas and sort to pollutant and a couple of ways.

Speaker 2:          00:20:07       So one is the pollutant away from just charitable donations to also thinking about, well, what should I think about with respect to make personal consumption? What should I think about with respect to my career if I'm really aiming to do as much good as possible, what should I do? And then secondly also starting to think about cause areas other than just global poverty as well, and it tends to be the case that within the community at the moment, the cause areas that people think are the very most pressing our global health and development still for sure. But then also factory farming, um, where again, there's just such a vast amount of suffering which is completely unnecessary. And then also preservation the long, long future of humanity and wedding about risks of, you know, global catastrophe, things that may be fairly unlikely but would be very, very bad. Um, if they did happen, especially relating to new technology like um, you know, novel pathogens, sort of violence as you could design in the lab and so on.

Speaker 3:          00:21:05       Well, you're also very concerned with ai as well, right? Artificial

Speaker 2:          00:21:08       intelligence. Yeah, that's exactly right. And that's, I think in this category of, if you look at the history of, um, human progress, technological change just creates these huge step changes and just how humanity progresses. So it was only 12 years, um, in 19 nine, 19, 33 to then 1945 between Leo Szilard first coming up with the idea of the nuclear chain reaction and that was just purely conceptual idea in a bit of paper, 12 years from that to then the deployment of the first nuclear bomb and think how radical a change that is having suddenly being in the nuclear age. That was only 12 years.

Speaker 3:          00:21:47       Yeah. We went over the, the invention of the airplane to dropping an atomic bomb out of the airplane. I believe it was 50 years, right? Somewhere in the neighborhood of 50 years. Yeah. Isn't that take a few?

Speaker 2:          00:21:59       Yeah. So technological progress can suddenly go in these huge leaps that we're not prepared for the well often very not prepared for. And I think artificial intelligence is in this context that you were, were really making a radical progress in ai, especially over the last five years. Um, it's really one of the fastest developing technologies, I think, and yet has huge potential and so many different ways. Um, and as with any new technology, huge positive potential relief, you get ai light, you can solve almost any problem, but also potential risks as well. Um, where there's a risk that might be more familiar. Um, you know, what he's about automation, unemployment and what he's about, autonomous weapons, which I think should be taken seriously. And then also just what he's about. Well, what if we could really do manage to make human level artificial intelligence? It's very good arguments that would then quickly move to super human level, artificial intelligence. And what then are we now in a situation like the neanderthals Homo Sapiens, where we've suddenly created this intelligence that's greater than our own? Are we able to control that? Are we able to ensure that transition is positive rather than negative? Have you ever ever

Speaker 3:          00:23:15       considered the possibility when you look at all the impoverished people in the world, all the cruelty, all the people that we are so concerned with, material possessions and shallow thinking and war and just the evil that men do, is it possible that we're sort of an outdated concept that what we are as these biological organisms that are still slaves to the whole Darwinian evolutionary survival of the fittest, natural selection sort of paradigm that we've operated under for all these many thousands and hundreds of thousands of years as humans? Is it possible that we're giving birth to the next thing that just like we don't long for the days when we used to be monkeys throwing shit at each other from the trees. One day we will be something different. Whether it will be a combination of us and these machines or whether we're going to augment our own intelligence with some sort of artificial.

Speaker 3:          00:24:18       Whether it's some sort of a an exo brain or something that's going to take us to the or. It's going to be simply that we create artificial intelligence. Artificial intelligence no longer has used for us because we're a logical and then that becomes the new life form and then we're, we're locked hide in the cave somewhere hoping the terminators don't get us. Yeah, I mean I think like over the longterm, I mean with all of these things, the question of kind of timelines is very hot and sometimes people want to project this discussion because Oh, this is so far in the future. Whereas I think like if something sufficiently report we should be talking about it even if maybe it's, you know, decades and generations hence might be right. I mean it might not be that far away, but who knows, Lakewood, the atomic bomb.

Speaker 3:          00:25:03       That was hugely fast progress. I'm just, you know, 12 years. So we want to be prepared. Um, but then has for like, yeah, is it going to be Homo sapiens around for the next, you know, in a thousand years' time. I think that would just be extremely unlikely. That will be around. You think we're not going to be around anymore. Yeah, I mean I think if intelligent creatures are still around, it's going to be some in a thousand years' time, it's going to be something that's not homo sapiens. Like he said this kind of fee. Um, oh. It's like not what we would consider consider kind of typical humans now. Well, we're obviously severely flawed. Right? And I mean, if we're, like, if you ask people, if you ask the average person, do you think that in your lifetime you can imagine a world without war? Most people say no. Like the vast majority of people say no war, a world without crime, a world without violence, a world without theft.

Speaker 3:          00:25:55       Most people say no. That's, that just shows you how inherently flawed. Most people view the human species. We know that we can do it in small groups. You know, like if the three of us were on an island, I'm pretty sure we wouldn't be stealing from each other and murder each other, right? Yeah, just a few of us. But when you get to large scale, humanity comes very easy to disassociate or create this diffusion of responsibility where there's enough people. So you don't really value them as much and you're allowed to get away with some pretty heinous stuff, especially when you consider drone warfare. Things that we're able to do with long distance where we're not seeing the person that we're having the effect on. Yeah, absolutely. It's a very flawed thing. The human species. Um, wouldn't it be better if something better came along? I mean, I think this. Yeah, sorta.

Speaker 2:          00:26:43       Yeah. I think that's the case though. Well, we'd be obsolete. Yeah. I mean, well, we're, we're going to be obsolete in a hundred years anyway. I mean I'm, as in will be dead. Right? So the question is just, um, we'll all kind of, you know, generations hence will, you know, it's not. The question is not really about us, it's about our grandchildren live. It really forces the idea to be considered like what is valuable about life? Like is it the experience, is it happiness? Is it shared fun? Is it love? Like what is, what's valuable about being a person and how much of that is going to change if we're made out of something that people have created or, or maybe were made out of something artificial intelligence has created because we've created something that's far superior to us. So yeah, I mean, I have a view on this as you might expect.

Speaker 2:          00:27:37       I mean, in my view, the thing that's valuable and the only thing that's valuable ultimately as conscious experience, so that's good. Like red conscious experiences, happy happiness, joy, and so on. That's positive, that's good for the world of negative conscious experiences, suffering, pain, distress, those are bad for the world. And so that's why, you know, it's a good thing for me to do some service to you to benefit you, but I can't do anything good to benefit this bottle of water. Right? And so then the key question in terms of what should we think about, supposing it is the case that, you know, thousand years time, it's now a synthetic life. It's artificial intelligence or something that's a, um, the, like the in charge and are no longer any humans. Would this be good or bad? The question for me is, you know, are they having conscious experiences and others conscious experiences, good or bad?

Speaker 2:          00:28:32       So that's it. Just conscious experience. Yeah. So it's a consumer so selfish. It's a controversial view. There's a thought experiment which is often used to challenge this view. Um, do you want to hear that? Yes. So it's called the experienced machine and the idea is supposing that tomato you could plug into this machine, it's like the most amazing vr you could ever have. And in this machine you will live, let's say you live 200 years and you'll be in the most amazing bliss. You'll have the most amazing experiences of, you know, and your experiences will involve incredible relationships, incredible creative achievement and so on. Um, and it'll just be like the perfect life that you could live expedientially for the next 200 years. And the question is in so far as yourself interested, so put aside considerations you might have about wanting to make the world a better place, but just in so far as you care about yourself, would you plug into this thing? Bearing in mind that in a certain sense all of these experiences is going to be fake. You're going to have experiences of having amazing friendships, laying great works of art. Can you think late works

Speaker 1:          00:29:41       of art and so on, but they're. They're not going to be available. It's just sensory inputs provided by a computer. Right. So the question is, would you or you in so far as your self interested and plug into this machine, what would you, what would you answer as a very good question? I might already be plugged into it, right? I mean you. Oh, so this is, this is a great question and I think it's a good argument against is the question will supposedly you will already plugged in. Would you unplug? Supposing I told you that actually you're a banker in Monaco and fuck Monaco, I just, I'm not interested in that. No, I want to stay right here. Yeah. So can I stay plugged in? Please? Do I have to pay more? Would have to do. You would have to do nothing, but it's interesting man. If people think so. Most people, and it seemed like maybe yourself would intuitively you'd say, no, I wouldn't plug into this machine. I don't know if I would say that I would have to really deeply consider it because right now it's just so. It's so abstract. This idea that that could be possible and so it's. It's fantasy. We were having fun, but when you talk to

Speaker 3:          00:30:52       the leading minds, when it comes to virtual reality or artificial reality or simulation theory, you know when they start talking about what will be possible one day they're going to without a doubt within a 100 years or 500 years or whatever the number is there going to be able to create an artificial reality. It's indiscernible from this reality. You're going to be able to feel things. There's going to be emotions that come to you. You're going, they're going to be able to recreate every single aspect of in everyday life. It's just a matter of time. I mean, they're really close now and not. Not really close in terms of like they don't give you emotions and they don't give you feeling, but if you put on an htc vive and go through some of those virtual reality games, I mean it's bizarre how real it feels.

Speaker 3:          00:31:37       And when you go back to like playing pong, did you ever play Polo? Yeah, absolutely. You know, it's such a weird thing that that happened inside of me when I was a kid. Pong came along, we were blown away. We couldn't believe that we could actually do something on the television. You could see it move. It was so fantastic and if you gave that to one of my kids, they'd spit on it. It'd be like, what kind of pizza shit video game is this. Like they would think it's just so ridiculous, but to me at the time it was amazing. You go from that to one of these htc vive games which has all taken place within my lifetime and you go, well, a lifetime from now. If you follow the exponential increase in the ability, the technological innovation, it's going to be spectacular. It's going to be. Absolutely. So when that does happen, how will you be able to know if it's indiscernible how will you know if you're in it and how do you know if you're not in it right now? That's the real question, right?

Speaker 1:          00:32:34       Yeah. I mean they'll actually some arguments for thinking, you know, this is nick boss than my colleague of mine simulation argument

Speaker 2:          00:32:40       for thinking we are and in late now, in fact, it's very likely that we should be. Yeah. I'm by that. Um, I actually, I'm kind of agnostic. I think you should take the, the hypothesis seriously. Um, but I think the, the argument doesn't quite go through for what's attractive and what's not attractive about that theory to you. So his version of it. Yeah. So the argument is the frame and if you could like his. So his argument is the, in the future, supposing we believe that the human race doesn't go extinct or post humans don't go extinct over the next thousand, few thousand years. And secondly, that the people in the future have an interest in recreating their past just for kind of historical interest of learning that they're going to be insistent running sync because then it got now going to have huge, amazing computer power.

Speaker 2:          00:33:31       They're going to be able to create simulations of the past that, um, that to have some interest in running simulations of the past. Well, the number of, if that is true, then the number of simulations that, uh, these future people are going to be running will vastly outnumber the number of actual timelines that kind of base universes at work. So for the one real universe where history, you're kind of unfolds, there's also, let's call it 10,000 simulations of that universe. And if that's true, then it's the case that well, given that I'm just, you know, these things nearly all and dishonorable for the people who are inside them is overwhelmingly likely just in the base plate that I'm going to be in a simulation rather than I'm in the real world. And what Nick Bostrom says, actually, it's not that we definitely honest simulation, but he just points out the conflict between these three kind of beliefs that we seem to hold.

Speaker 2:          00:34:34       One is that we're not going to go extinct in the near future too, is that, you know, people in the future, we'll have some interest in simulating the past and thirdly that we're not living in a simulation and he himself gives, you know, a reasonable degree of belief. Maybe he thinks it's like 10 percent, 15 percent likely that within a simulation, other people who understand the argument very a bit more, but I think, you know, it's something you should at least be taken seriously. Um, the reason I object it is kind of, um, uh, even weirder. I think it's somewhat technical, but the basic thought is just the, um, according to like the best guesses from Cosmo monogenists, we're actually in an infinite universe. The Universe is infinitely big now. We can't affect an infinitely big universe were restricted by the speed of light to what we can affect and to what we can see.

Speaker 2:          00:35:31       Um, but the best idea according to the best thing that we have universities of keeps on going, but if so, then there's old lady like an infinite number of observers of people can have in that bottom universe and that means that you've now got kind of an infinite number of people kind of experiencing things and then you've got the simulations and you've got like 10,000 simulations, but you can't say there's 10,000 times as many simulated beings. Is that our legal beings? Because there's already an infinite number of beings. You're looking so good. Uh, constantly. No, no, go ahead, keep going. But that means if you've got. So the key of the, um, of Bostrom's argument was that you've got 10,000 times as many simulated beings as you have real like non simulated beings, right?

Speaker 3:          00:36:23       The problem is, is an infinite number of real beings because the universe is infinite.

Speaker 2:          00:36:28       Yeah, that's right. And so if you've already got an infinite number of real beings, the fact that you've got 10,000 times infinite, that's still infinite, right? You can't. It's kind of a case where like our best methods of assigning degrees of belief to things kind of on out. If you think it's, you know, there's an infinite number of simulated beings and infinite number of real beings. Then what's the chance of you being one of the other, like we don't actually have the tools to be able to answer that.

Speaker 3:          00:36:56       Neil degrasse Tyson was trying to explain this to me a couple of weeks ago that there are infinities that are bigger than other infinities

Speaker 2:          00:37:05       yeah. So that's also the case, but yeah, that was my roof, my brain. And so the number, but the key, we're all talking about the lowest was called cardinality, the smallest infinity, which is the size of the infinity of all the integers. One, two, three, four. Counting numbers. And if you take that size of infinity and multiply it by 10,000, let's say you just get the same number, which is infinity, right? Um, and then what Neil was saying was he had to at least even bigger levels of infinity. So if you look at not just all the counting numbers, but all of the numbers, you can make fractions out of a half a quarter, an eighth and so on. That's a bigger. That's just more numbers than the infinity of the counting numbers.

Speaker 3:          00:37:52       I've spent a lot of time trying to understand why human beings are so obsessed with innovation, why human beings are so obsessed with technological progress. And one of the things that I continued to come to is that we think of everything in this world as being natural, but the behavior of butterflies and wolves and the way rivers run down from the mountain. But we don't think of ourselves and our own behavior as natural. We don't think of our own thirst for conquest and innovation and and the even materialism. I think materialism is probably a very natural reaction to our need to somehow or another fuel innovation. And that. One of the ways to ensure that innovation is constantly fueled is that people are constantly obsessed with buying new things, constantly obsessed with the latest and greatest which fuels innovation. And when you look at the universe itself and you look at all the various things that we know to be natural processes in the universe, like tucked in order to make a human being, a star has to explode when you literally are made out of Stardust, which is when you run that by people for the first time they go, wait what?

Speaker 3:          00:39:05       Like in order to you for you to have carbon based life form that has to be created inside a burning, dying star. And that's the only way you make this thing like what you are right now. And then that thing makes artificial reality. And then that thing makes perhaps even crazier. Makes I mean if you follow the ideas of technological progress, if something gets to a point where it's indiscernible from reality, how do you know it's not a new reality? How do you know it's not a new kind of reality? Like Jamie sent me hip to these artificial worlds that people have created online where there essentially infinite and they're constantly changing and morphing and growing. And the Games are terrible. People don't like them because you go go to places and there's fucking nothing there and you can go to an infinite number of these places and there's nothing there.

Speaker 3:          00:39:55       Like these adventures are nonexistent, so you're on these. You're in these gigantic fake worlds where you're traveling from place to place, but right now we're looking at it in a very two dimensional way. You're looking at it on a flat screen one day. It's not going to be two dimensional. One day it's going to be something that you're interfacing with your consciousness is interfacing with it. Is it only real if we can take it and drop it on something, if we can hit it with a hammer, if we could put it on a scale, if we can use a measuring stick and measuring, is it only real there or is it real? If it follows every single check, like if you check off every single item on the list of conscious reality and conscious experience.

Speaker 2:          00:40:41       I think that's a great question because I think the dichotomy that a lot of people think in terms of natural and unnatural, I think it's just meaningless. Um, I mean, people firstly think this is natural and this is not, I mean, in a sense everything we're doing is natural because we're like homosapiens a part of a natural process and in another, maybe in another sense everything we're doing is not natural. But then why does that matter? What's the model? The relevance of something being natural versus not natural. Lots of stuff that happens in the natural world is just really awful, huge amounts of cannibalism. They like, um, uh, suffering, so it's not clear why we would care about something being natural, natural. Um, but then the second question is, yeah, let's consider this a virtual reality again, um, this experience machine that you could plug yourself into.

Speaker 2:          00:41:36       And as part of the description I said, oh, none of this would be a real. You'd have all of these interactions with people that you think are friends and so on, but that wouldn't be avail. And I think you could very well pushed back on that and say why should something be physically instantiated? Like, uh, in order for it to count as a real experience, why is it not the case that in this virtual reality, your interacting with algorithms, but that's just as much, at least it's possible for that to be just as much friendship as if you're interacting with people who are flesh and blood. And I think it's hard to explain kind of what the difference would be because you know, if you think about star trek, usually quicker, it can be friends with data and android is not kind of bio biological, but you know, we think that, uh, you can still have kind of worth and friendships and so on with creatures that are not made of kind of human biology, in which case, why is the fact that something merely lives on silicone? Why wouldn't. That was kind of seemingly merely software. What does that mean? You couldn't have kind of a genuine friendship with that thing if it the. If Actin is sufficiently sophisticated way perhaps

Speaker 3:          00:42:53       isn't there also an issue with are incredibly limited ability to view reality itself because we're only viewing the dimensions that are relevant to us in this current state of carbon based life form. This curt, this is talking monkey claim to the spaceship flying through the universe. This is, this is what's important to us, but when you pay attention to those dudes who write on yellow legal pads and they get into quantum physics and they have all those crazy equations that nobody but them understands, maybe you do. I look at that shit and I go, what the fuck are they writing? But they believe, I mean, what is the current model? They, they believe there's at least 11 dimensions that perhaps could be more. What if there is a dimension that you can plug into that it's purely consciousness driven, meaning there's no physical experience. There's no touching the ground.

Speaker 3:          00:43:41       There's no gravity, but you exist in a conscious state and it's perpetual. Like if you take a rocket ship and it gets past our gravity and shoots off into distance space and you have a clear shot of, you know, 14 billion years back to the beginning of the universe itself with nothing in the way, you're just going to keep going for $14, billion light years, you're just going to keep going. Like, what if there is a place that your consciousness can go to like that where it can't, it's no longer burdened by biology, by the timeline of birth to death, by the limitations of the flesh. But consciousness itself can exist in some bizarre dimension that we just have an access to.

Speaker 2:          00:44:22       So, yeah, I mean, I think consciousness is probably just ultimately a physical process. Why do you think that in a ultimately [inaudible] of a conservation of energy? Um, the reason being so, you know, this is age, old philosophical debate between, um, the motorists and lists people who think is consciousness just ultimately some sort of physical process or is it something special? So descartes thought there was this, um, old grant gland. There's a little bit of your brain and your conscious kind of soul was just going to steering your, like monkey body free with this pineal gland. But the question is just for why I think the strongest argument about why that couldn't be right is it seems to be like it would have to be creating energy out of nowhere and we've never. There seems to be just fixed law of the universe that just can't happen because in order for, you know, this conscious mind to, if it's not merely a physical process, if it's not just the brain, in order for that to be able to effect what this physical entity is doing, it would have to use energy to be able to do that.

Speaker 2:          00:45:35       So the energy would have to be coming from somewhere and if it's not coming from just the physical realm, then suddenly we've got this counter examples to all the rest of science

Speaker 3:          00:45:43       sort of. But you aware of the theories of human neurotransmitters being pathways to other dimensions, like dimethyltryptamine didn't know about all that. Um, I mean, I know about the empty. Do you know what it's produced in the pineal gland where descartes thought that all that stuff was going on the seat of the soul with the Egyptians called the eye of horus. The reason why the Catholics and so many ancient religions were so focused on pine cones and their, their art and their, their imagery. That's the pineal gland. That's the image of it. That's what it's supposed to represent. And for people who've had these intense, transformative psychedelic experiences by consuming exogenous dimethyltryptamine, which is produced by the brain that you have these insane, transformative experiences where you feel like you are traveling to other dimensions. Yeah. So I think, I mean, I do want to say like, have you done any of that? Um, I've never done DMT, son of eventual not what are you doing? You're wasting your time. I know that's a good way, but, but it's something that's in the brain. I mean, it's a natural product of a human biology.

Speaker 2:          00:46:46       I mean, whether it's natural or not isn't the question just, uh, you know, if I'm going to have a career based on my brain, I want to be very careful to, to not break it, to not be okay. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:46:56       Yeah. But it's one of the most transient drugs ever observed in the body. Your body brings it back to baseline in like 15 minutes.

Speaker 2:          00:47:01       Hmm. Okay. Is that, um, because I mean, there's a lot of. I do think there's like tons of people very often, greatly overestimate the risks of nonlegal blogs, like mdms like super safe and so on.

Speaker 3:          00:47:14       Very overestimate the list, the risks that you're saying. Yeah. That's the MTMA yeah. Yeah. Is Weird, right? That's a weird one. It's not a natural drug. Dimethyltryptamine. I think the real concern would be psychological because what you face

Speaker 1:          00:47:30       is so bizarre. Terence Mckenna Mckenna had the best quote about it. I think he said that, uh, you would risk death by astonishment. Yeah. Okay. So their thing. Well, it's a, it's so bizarre that it's almost a sin for a guy as smart as you did not experience it, but will you just come right back and you're, even when you're there, you're there mean to you. It's not like you, your consciousness dissolves into some bizarre quasi living state and then you have to like work your way back to being you again. Now you're, you. You're will macaskill in the dimension, whatever the fuck it is. But what's crazy about it is that this is produced in the very area where descartes was believing the seat of the soul is in so many different eastern religions and all, all this psychological, like all these different, all these different religions and all these different cultures, they were all convinced at that one gland had some massive significance in terms of the spirit and the soul, whatever that means.

Speaker 1:          00:48:34       Whatever spirit means. So yeah. So then the question is just in these experiences, is it the case that you'll like seeing into genuinely seeing into another dimension, or is it the case that just have a new kind of perspective on consciousness? So one thing I do think is that in terms of conscious experience, this the sort of conscious experiences that humans have access to, and I think that must just be point zero, zero, one percent of the entire landscape of possible conscious experiences. So if you think, imagine if you have a bat and you could echo locate, that's just a radically different conscious experience. I don't think that maps on to any sort of conscious experience that humans could have. Have you seen people do that? Blind people can do that. It's pretty amazing. That is amazing. Very effectively too. It's like shockingly effectively. Yeah, I think you're absolutely right.

Speaker 1:          00:49:22       I mean, but there's also experiences, human experiences that are available without drugs that some people have achieved through radical states of meditation and Kundalini Yoga where they could achieve natural psychedelic states, holotropic breathing, people that have done that. I've experienced like really radical psychological transformations and incredible psychedelic experiences from that as well. Yeah. And so I think like, um, these sorts of experiences are very important, very interesting. Um, and what they, you know, I said that maybe we experienced this point zero, one percent of all possible conscious experiences and that just allows you to do like see a little bit more of this potential vast landscape. Uh, well as I think, but I think there's nothing on magical about saying ultimately that's all explained in terms of physics in terms of um, different sorts of neurons firing and differences once have a transmit as and so on. We don't need to say, oh, and it's also this other thing which breaks all the known laws of physics that you're seeing into some other dimension. In order for that to be an incredibly important thing.

Speaker 2:          00:50:28       I'm a as unscientific to say we know almost nothing about consciousness in terms of the areas of scientific inquiry. We have no understanding at all about the relationship between conscious experiences and um, you know, what we would think of as physical processes. We really have no idea about, you know, if you take, give me any sufficiently complicated physical processes, which, uh, which are conscious and which are not all we can go on is really, that's what I'm conscious. And so I know the things that kind of liked me or probably conscious too and that's the best we've got really. Um, and this is known as a hard problem of consciousness and force. It was often say they've solved it with something and I think it's always begging the question. I think we should be very open to the fact that I'm just as in um, you know, 3000 BC people had no idea about the laws of physics. This was just completely unexplored territory. We should think contemporary science, this is just a big, like a big black gap in our scientific understanding. And perhaps it's something maybe 21st century science, maybe 22nd century science can really get to grips with.

Speaker 3:          00:51:38       Yeah. It does seem like the ultimate question, like what is it for, why is it here? What controls it? Is it in the mind? Is it external? Is the brain just to an antenna that tunes into consciousness? The dimethyltryptamine question is so bizarre because it's the most potent psychedelic drug known to man and your brain man.

Speaker 2:          00:52:01       Except for I didn't know if this is a myth I've heard. It's what gets made when you die.

Speaker 3:          00:52:07       Yeah. The third, they believe that during high rates of stress where your body believes you're going to die and when your dreaming, when you're in heavy rem sleep, your body produces larger amounts of it than, than baseline. But they don't know. It's, it's really difficult. They've only just now within the last few years, the Cottonwood Research Foundation, which, uh, uh, Dr Rick Strassman has a big part of it. He's the guy who wrote the book Dmt, the spirit molecule. He did a bunch of the first FDA approved drug trials with civilians where they took people and they gave them a schedule, one drug dimethyltryptamine, which is so crazy that it's a schedule one drug that your body produces, but they gave it to be bull intravenously over the course of several months. And they documented all the different trips and all the different. Um, the different commonalities that these people had in their experiences and he's working very closely with the cottonwood research foundation and one of the things that they found is that they've recently discovered it was just anecdotal evidence that it was produced by the pineal gland.

Speaker 3:          00:53:15       We knew the DMT was produced by the liver and the lungs, but now they know for sure because they've isolated it in rats. So in living rats, they know that they produce dmt with the gland. So that, that explains a lot of, you know, ancient eastern mysticism and all the symbology this holy symbols that people had to represent this gland. Now they know, okay, well this is definitely does produce this incredibly potent psychedelic drug. But now the cross, the question is at what levels during what periods of stress, like how do you have to bring someone to the point of death before they experienced this? And if that is the case, is it possible that consciousness itself is something that we, you know, since we haven't really figured out what exactly it is, is it possible that consciousness can travel through this chemical pathway that maybe these intense dimethyltryptamine experiences are in fact a gateway to what people have assumed exists from the beginning of time, like an afterlife or a sea of souls or something, some, some stage of existence other than this physical existence that we all experience right now. Yeah. So I mean, I feel like I'd be crazy talk, right? It's as big they see

Speaker 2:          00:54:31       coming out of my mouth. I'm going, what the fuck are you talking about? Dude? I mean I think I just be suppliers of consciousness was just this one chemical. I think it's much more likely that something is this emergent phenomena from this incredibly complex system of, you know, billions of different neurons filing in a certain way and when you have a certain process that sufficiently complex in the right way somehow, and this is just this big black box that we've got no idea about, somehow subjective experience comes out of that. But it would seem, I mean otherwise the issue is you could have just dmt to traveling and just a test tube or something and petri dish and it would seem like, oh, is this petri dish? I'm conscious that would seem the least lane.

Speaker 3:          00:55:11       Why would that be the case? If you're breathing air and you're, you know, the air keeps you alive, like you're breathing in and breathing that you don't think that air carries the life with it to another place. Right. Era is just a component of life. It's something that your body requires. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:55:25       So I mean it's possible. Maybe it's the case though. Again, I feel I'd be surprised if it was like this chemical is necessary for consciousness and stuff.

Speaker 3:          00:55:32       I'm not saying that's necessarily, but what I am curious as to how consciousness varies. Consciousness, consciousness and the actual feeling of being alive varies depending upon your health. Depending behind stress levels, depending upon love and happiness and all these different factors change the way you view the world, which is really interesting because in in effect that change is consciousness and you can be more. You know, you can be more elevated, like you can guarantee you all of this effect of altruism that you're concentrating on is somehow another elevating your consciousness because you're putting out so much love and so much happiness and you are helping so many people. There's so many positive benefits to your very existence. I've got to manage, I've got to believe rather than somehow or another that manages to come back to you.

Speaker 2:          00:56:22       I, it definitely comes back

Speaker 3:          00:56:24       to me in kind of how I feel about my life. I mean, when we were talking about how, uh, you know, money is just not the key to a happy life. The question is, well, what is, and the answers are having a great community, um, having a greater purpose in life, feeling like you're making a difference. So all of these reasons of why. So we've built up this kind of community around effective altruism. Um, you know, people all around the world who are making a significant change. So for example, donating 10 percent of the income to the charities they think are most effective or pursuing a career that we think is really effective. And one thing I wasn't surprising from the outset, but I'm so happy happened is that there's a strong community is formed. It's kind of like a little global village or something and people have found the actually far from being a sacrifice as you might have expected, was actually incredibly rewarding because you've now got this community of people who have shared aims to you and you're all working towards this greater goal.

Speaker 3:          00:57:24       And that's something that I think is very lacking in the world today. So many people just, they work nine to five and you know, they have a nice time on the weekends, but they're like, where there's all of this going and at the end of my life am I really going to think, yeah, I made the most of this. Whereas if you think at the end of your life like, Yup, I dedicated my life to helping others and I had this transformative impact on thousands of people, you're not going to think at the end of your life, Gee, I really wasted that. It's just something I don't think you can really look at. If you go deep though down the philosophical rabbit hole and you really consider that life is this temporary experience and even benefiting someone through this temporary experience is still a temporary experience. It's like you are helping somebody gave them a pillow for the ride and it's a temporary ride and the ride comes to an end and then what? And then what is the point of all this like what is the point of effective altruism if you're just helping people during this temporary ride, it doesn't seem to

Speaker 2:          00:58:24       mean anything. Yeah. So I think there's two things. Um, I like it. I have loads. I can do that too. Just raise up. I just go with the. It was freak myself out. Well, we do get freaked out at this, you know, when you think of cosmic is essential and so thanks to existence. So I think there's two. I think it was two emphasis yet. Okay. The first is that the light is the goal. Ultimately, again, if you think the purpose of life is to increase the amount of happiness and the juice, the amount of suffering, the final goal is good experiences and the kind of anti goal is bad experiences. So when we're sitting here talking, having a great time, this is us kind of achieving getting points in the wind. I'm counter so we're having to just time. That's like, yeah, if we were really hating this then we'd be losing.

Speaker 3:          00:59:16       Well even more so because we're broadcasting this live and millions of people are gonna hear it and hopefully not having hopefully that enjoying it. Hopefully, and maybe if they're not at least a little stress relief, like maybe they're at the gym and I go, these fucking idiots when they're doing squats and they're getting angry.

Speaker 2:          00:59:31       Yeah, so I think that's the first thing, but then the second thing is I'm late to this idea of cosmic significance where Juan often motivate. So you say, Oh, well we're just along for the ride. We're all going to get eaten up by the sun eventually and so on. What's the calculator? Purpose of life by actually think what are some ways that our actions now can have much greater cosmic significance and that's if that's because I think if you think that the human race survives for the next few centuries, it seems kind of inevitable that we're going to spend to the stars. Um, and I think that would be good. Again, from this perspective, we can go into more arguments if you want, of just saying what we want to do is promote happiness and reduce suffering. If that means we can live on other planets as well and have kind of fiving civilizations there.

Speaker 2:          01:00:25       Not only were the people are having great lives but also making scientific artistic contributions and so on, then that's a good thing to do as well. Well, there's no technological reason for thinking that we won't be able to do that in the future. I'm given current late to technological progress unless something really bad happens along the way, and this kind of gets back to one of the things we talked about right at the start was one of the focus areas of the effective altruism community is on turnover. Juice risks from, of human extinction, of global catastrophic risks. These are the sorts of things that could imperil the human journey as it were. Um, and I think if you're working to mitigate some of these things, then you're increasing the chance that we do get to the sort of level where, um, he, yeah, humanity can have a five in the future, not just on this planet but on other planets as well. And that actually means your actions really do have this huge cosmic significance. So the conscious effort to be

Speaker 3:          01:01:31       kind, person, a generous person and effective altruism spreads and it impacts people. There's this ripple effect and your good deeds could perhaps fuel enough people with this thought and with effective altruism and more people might act on that to the point where we reduced the amount of suffering to the point where we extend the lifespan of human beings. We extend the areas where we have no war. We reduced the amount of violence to the point where we can successfully innovate to the point where we can get off this planet. That's that. And then start from scratch with a new dictator on Mars, Donald Trump on Mars. How about that? Um, yeah. I mean, so I think the boat, none. Mars will become president of Mas. I'd be pretty happy with that. Be Fascinating if we'd have to go to war with Maurice. Yeah. Do you think though the.

Speaker 3:          01:02:20       I mean I've wondered about this many, many times. I wonder if it's an outdated idea, this idea of traveling to the stars. And again, I go back to this whole inter dimensional thing that I wonder if that's the reason why we have never been visited by other planets, by species from another planet. Maybe that's not what happens. Maybe they develop artificial realities. Maybe like Jamie was talking about to me with these artificial computer realities. Like if, if someone develops some sort of a matrix like world where you can plug into an experience and an infinite number of things in an infinite number of artificially created dimensions that are indistinguishable from this, why would you want to like risk a six month trip and a metal tube to another planet? I mean maybe that's really retro. Maybe that's a really ancient way of looking at things. Maybe it's like Zepplins, like big flying balloons instead of, you know,

Speaker 2:          01:03:12       so yeah, the question you raised is called the Fermi paradox, which is just given this. So 100 billion stars in our galaxy, m 8 billion galaxies in the effect double universe, 100 billion in the observable universe. Uh, the nfs is also the old 15 billion years old. So if it was the case that life is very common that it's very easy for us to, um, life to then developed a level of advanced technological ability. We should expect to see evidence of aliens all over the Bronx. But yet we see absolutely none. And that means that from somewhere from a habitable planet, somewhere along the path from habitable planet to um, you kind of space fanning civilization, there must be some big filter. There must be some step that's just incredibly hard for that to have it. And can I be unlikely that civilization musome or life moves from that step to another.

Speaker 2:          01:04:11       And one hypothesis is this, yeah, like people just society. Civilization gets to sufficiently advanced level and they just chill out. They just go internally. Yeah. They go and tunnel. The issue with that explanation I think is it's just not long enough because, you know, you'd have to think that that's for this kind of filter to work has to be able to really filter. Filter. Yeah. As in like, because there's so many stars, so many earth, so many seemingly habitable planets. Um, it has to be the case that it's exceptionally unlikely at some stage of other like, and not just really unlikely as in like, you know, one in a trillion, unlikely to, on this path for them, habitable planet to space fading civilization. And so you'd have to think of a trillion civilizations that get to this level of technological ability, the old shoes to turn inward.

Speaker 2:          01:05:06       And that seems very unlikely. It seems like, well, at least one word really spread out. And if so, then we'd see evidence of that. Um, because cosmically speaking the time for them, I'm getting to the level of technological capability where you can spend to the stars and the level where we'd be able to get to see real evidence of that is kind of small. So I actually think that the reason that we can't see aliens is because the very first stages of life and incredibly unlikely the move from nothing to kind of basic application. And then secondly to move from single celled organisms to multicellular organisms. And the reason for thinking this is very unlikely is it took an incredibly long time. I'm on earth billions of years before this happened and in particular in the move from single cell to multi-celled life, that's only ever happened once. And so given that we don't see any aliens, we should think some part of this is really hard. Our best guess is that, that, that move them single cell to multi-celled and perhaps from the creation of the first cells as well, that was incredibly difficult. Um, and that means that we're just exceptionally lucky to be alive as it were. But

Speaker 3:          01:06:24       if the universe is infinite, that means that this has happened in infinite number of times.

Speaker 2:          01:06:30       That's what I though it might be very far away. Probably like sufficiently far the way that we are not connectable to eat. Like we can't contact each other, observe each other.

Speaker 3:          01:06:39       But there's an infinite number of those infinitely far places.

Speaker 2:          01:06:44       Yes, there will be some. There will be some like clusters of the universe and again, the idea that the universe is infinite. Certainly a hypothesis, and I'm just deferring to other people who say it's the leading.

Speaker 3:          01:06:55       Well, the most puzzling hypothesis to me was the evidence of supermassive black holes being at the center of every galaxy and that the hypothesis was that the supermassive black holes are exactly one half of one percent of the mass, the entire galaxy. And then if you go through those supermassive black holes, you may in fact go into a completely new universe filled with hundreds of billions of galaxies, each with supermassive black holes at the center of those galaxies, which will take you to hundreds of billions of galaxies in another universe. And that it's never ending. And that's what the real infinity is. It's not just the mass of all the things that we can observe in the 14 plus billion light years that we know of from the Big Bang to today. It's all of those things being portals to incredibly different. Totally new universes. Okay. So it's turtles all the way down. Turtles all the way down. So the. The real question to me, and this I had, I proposed this to Brian Cox, I didn't get a sufficient answer. It's why would we assume that there's someone more advanced than us? Like it is possible that someone, some species, some thing is the tip of the spear that some thing is the first,

Speaker 1:          01:08:16       that something is the most advanced life form in the universe. Why would we assume that someone would be more advanced than us? If we are the most advanced thing that we can find? The only logic that I could point to was that, that we're relatively young in terms of the history and the age of the universe itself. The university itself being roughly 14 billion years old. We are four point six. What do we. What is the age of the earth? Somewhere, somewhere in there, somewhere in the neighborhood, right. Relatively young. When you consider that 10 billion years of life give or take happen or, or existence happened before we came along, why would we assume that there's anything out there that's more advanced and why would we assume that this isn't as far as anybody's ever gotten? I mean, that's so in terms of infinity, right? Fourteen billion years seems like a long time, but in terms of infinity, it's a blink.

Speaker 1:          01:09:12       So I think we should believe that in the. And again, let's now just fits the infinity and just think about the observable universe, which is finite because people pulled over sweating in their car right now. Yeah. Yeah, exactly. Infinity. Have you ever heard of claims number? This is not a total digression of claims number. I don't believe so. It was known as um, uh, the largest number ever. Seriously used in the mathematical proof and the table and of wait. But why has this amazing post? I'm trying to explain just how big could I am's number. It is. And I think you have to use a special notation and what's to be able to explain it. The numbers just get really big and once you really start to think this through, you're just like your left, just kind of rocking back and forth. Um, yeah. No, like just peeked out.

Speaker 1:          01:10:01       Yeah. For the little monkey, Lillian is so big affiliate. It's just a speck of dust compared to even a trillion years, a speck of dust. When you consider the possibility of the universe itself being infinite or the possibility that is a continuous cycle of big bangs to expansion, to contraction back to an infinitely small point, back to another big bang, which is a plausible possibility. Yeah. I mean, I think, yeah. I'm also, I'm fairly. Well, you know, I'm not, I'm not neil degrasse Tyson, a butch thing, tons of the science. I think my understanding of the moment is that we currently think that the universe is just expanding and it just keeps expanding. I know it's definitely a leading theory that it was going to expand and slow and then kind of on. Yes. Um, but you mentioned a humans being the most advanced kind of cliche.

Speaker 1:          01:10:51       I think that probably is correct in the observable or certainly our galaxy, let's say in our. Well we know it is in our solar system, right? Yeah, that's right. But I think we know it isn't our galaxy as well. I think so. And again the nice so far. But the thing is that, um, it's far as in it's like 100,000 light years thinking about, but when you're thinking about 15 billion years of age of the universe, that's actually just a very short period of time. But why would you assume that 100,000 light years from now there is not something exactly like us. So it's possible. But the thing is that if it was somewhat easy or if it was just not incredibly difficult for intelligent life to evolve, then it would have happened in the past already and we will see evidence of it and the fact that we don't see any evidence at all of intelligent life and other solar systems or, and like a toll a suggest. It's incredibly difficult for that to happen. But isn't that like being in the woods and unzipping your tent and sticking your head out and saying, I don't see anything. This must be empty woods. Um, it's more like,

Speaker 1:          01:12:00       I mean, you're talking about a very small area that you've observed and we've taken account of. So I think it's more like, um, because I think

Speaker 1:          01:12:13       if an alien civilization or us in the future goes to kind of start, um, uh, yeah, spending to the stars in the course of, you know, uh, just a few seconds, million years, let's say there'll be nearly significant evidence you'd see dyson's spheres being constructed around sons, you know, to harness the sun's energy. You'd see some evidence of like dialectic engineering projects and so on. It'd be like a really big impact. You'd see that with hundreds of thousands of light years between us and the observable objects, again, 100,000 light years is just not very long. Um, compared to the kind of 15 billion. So it would just be this amazing coincidence if it's the case that he, a life that's as advanced and more advanced than us has a voltage, just the same time as us were 100,000 years, give or take is basically just the same time but hasn't evolved in the past, hasn't involved more than a million years ago where we will start to see kind of major impact of that.

Speaker 1:          01:13:16       So if something within the observable universe we've observed so little, we don't even have really adequate photographs of anything outside of our solar system. I mean everything is just radio spectrum, you know, these, the analysis is that they're getting off of light waves of what the components of the atmosphere is. And so using your analogy, what I'm suggesting is that, um, if it was the case that alien life was not intelligent, life was not that hard to come by. You'd stick your head out of the 10 and you look like Tokyo. I've often looking like the woods. Why does it have to look like Tokyo? Why can't it look like Kansas? Why can't I be like really spread out? And very little life because I think if life is splitting out, then it's just going to want to, what does life do? It just phase to harness resources in place to color more of itself. And maybe it reaches a point where it realizes that's few tile just concentrates on effective altruism at home. Oh battlestar.

Speaker 2:          01:14:12       So that's the turning inward suggestion again. And so maybe it's the case that like, yeah,

Speaker 3:          01:14:18       like is it more important to get your shit together at home or to go all over the world with the same bullshit ideas, right? I mean that's the case would not be the same thing that you could turn towards interstellar travel. Like wouldn't it be more important for these communities to concentrate on taking care of their planet and figuring out a way to work in some sort of a harmonious fashion with the very nature of the planet itself rather than travel to the star.

Speaker 2:          01:14:48       I mean possibly, but now imagine this. So on this alien alien planet, there's 10 billion aliens and they're like, let's say that a thousand years more advanced than humans at the moment. Uh, in order for this argument to work, it'd have to be the case that every single one of them makes that decision to just turn inwards and focus on why was that

Speaker 3:          01:15:09       the case because not all those people would be the ones that would innovate in the first place. It wouldn't have to be everyone that makes a decision, but have to be everyone have a high enough consciousness to figure out how to make these interstellar machines decides not to harness this nuclear power and jet off into space.

Speaker 2:          01:15:24       But I think over time that will just, that would just be everyone because. Well, yeah, I mean just technological progress just keeps going. And eventually like tech. I mean obviously we're doing this like weird though, experiment speculating on economics and sociology of um, hypothetical alien world. But, uh, I mean just at some point as that, as a civilization progresses, then, um, there's gonna be many, many actors. I'm with sufficient power. So it's sort of liability to spend to the stars. You need to say that every single one of them decides to turn inwards.

Speaker 3:          01:16:02       So it's sort of like, um, technology becomes very rare and then ultimately over time becomes very common like the cell phone cell phone. Right. So when cell phone was first invented, it was extremely rare and very expensive. Now everyone has one and the capabilities of those cell phones have greatly, greatly improved and that this will happen with everything including space travel.

Speaker 2:          01:16:24       Yeah. But also it doesn't need to be the case that gets up to 10 billion people. Even if it's just like a thousand people or something. Again, it would just seem unlikely that, you know, in every civilization and every one just has, you know, even just a thousand people, everyone chooses not a single person thinks, hey, I would just want that to be more like spread out.

Speaker 3:          01:16:44       Now that obviously is dependent upon there being a more advanced civilization than human beings on the planet earth. Because if there weren't, if there were a few years behind us, like if they're stuck in the 19 fifties or maybe they're stuck in ancient Greece or you know, then then obviously they don't have the capabilities yet. We might be the very most advanced, we might be the very tip of the spear. Right?

Speaker 2:          01:17:06       Yeah, and I just think, yeah, because I think it would be unlikely that

Speaker 1:          01:17:12       something more advanced happened just a little bit faster than us, but not say 100 million years ago, which is not very long ago. Right. In cosmic terms, but it's still possible. I mean it's still possible that something happened a hundred years quicker than us or that they haven't had the same setbacks that we've had in terms of asteroidal impacts and natural catastrophe supervolcanoes and the link. Yeah, it's a, it's a real weird thought experiment because you start thinking, you start extrapolating, okay, well where are we going to be? You know, where are we going to be in, why would we do that? Like that's one of the things that always gets me about this whole trip to Mars and I had a joke about it in my, of my last comedy special where people, where somebody actually said this to me because it was before California. It's solved it's drought or Mother Nature solved our drought for us rather.

Speaker 1:          01:17:59       Or people like, hey man, we should really consider going to Mars because mean look at our environment and California is almost out of water. And my joke was like, we're right next to the fucking ocean. Like there's so much water. You can see the end of it. We have a salt problem. We don't have a water problem. Like what are you going to do? You going to bring water to Mars? Like that's the stupidest thing I've ever heard in my life. Yeah. This, this weird. When people start talking about. I mean I think so there's the, it's going to Mas St Newton laws saying in McCone right now, like the aim of doing that because it's awesome. Totally on board with that the same way as like going to the moon. It's like look what we can achieve. This is an exciting like global human fluidic totally just the space shuttle going into orbit.

Speaker 1:          01:18:37       It's pretty bad ass, right? Yeah, exactly. Exactly. But then this talk of like, oh well we need this and what's to be able to survive as a species. I'm like, look, if you want to have this kind of refuge or colony in order to make the math more robust, Mazda is just not a great place to pick. There's so many different ways that, um, I mean Mazda's like wally and inhospitable and if you wanted to build a refuge, why not go into the sea? Um, that's like a going to be protected from, um, you know, Viola says or asteroid impacts. And so really though, if one of those big things that slammed into the Yucatan slams into where your villages and the sea, I mean, if you, if you had, um, this underwater village with 10 years of food supplies and so on, then you could like come back because the impact from the asteroid wasn't just like shook everyone office that the sky is falling, the sky is get clouded over with earth rang for a million years.

Speaker 1:          01:19:33       Oh, what is that as nla impact. Yeah. That's so interesting. That's so insane. When you think about how big that thing was that killed the dinosaurs 65 million years ago and that there's hundreds of thousands of those things floating around in space. So yeah, I was asking some people at Nasa just, um, uh, just two days ago actually on how many of them we've managed to identify because their cvs about kind of scanning the skies to find them all. Um, and the answer, I thought we had it covered. I thought this was something that Nasa was like, yeah, yeah, we know with all the like.

Speaker 2:          01:20:09       And they have response was like, no, we've got no idea. We just, we don't know how many of them then. And so we don't know how many we've managed to track.

Speaker 3:          01:20:17       There's a guy named Randall Carlson and I found on podcast a few times and he's obsessed with the idea that asteroidal impacts were probably would have ended the ice age, you know, 10 to 12,000 years ago. And, and he, there's a significant amount of physical evidence that points to this, um, both in, um, evidence of impact and nuclear glass. Try think it's called tribe tonight. I forget the exact word, but it, it appears all throughout Europe and Asia and around that same timeline, around 10,000 and 12,000 years ago when they do core samples and it points to this idea that there were significant impacts from asteroidal objects all over Europe and all over Asia around that time. And they think some of them slammed into the ice caps that were, you know, North America was covered in a giant chunk of it was covered in as much as two miles high of ice just 10,000 years ago.

Speaker 3:          01:21:13       And he points to an incredible amount of physical change in the environment that looks like it took place over a very short period of time. Like catastrophic change over incredibly short amount of time that he believes points to these impacts. Melting the ice caps, creating massive amount of flooding, killing off. Who knows how many people resetting civilization in many different parts of the world. And this evidence of these, uh, of the nuclear glass of these micro diamonds that also exist. They find them during a nuclear test sites when they blow off bombs and they also find them at asteroidal impacts sites and you know, when, you know that we have been hit many times in the past and they do have evidence of that and then you see the moon and all the different impact craters on the moon. He know that this is just what he calls a cosmic shooting gallery essentially. He's like, it's very likely that that was the cause of the end of the ice age. There's a lot of, there's climate data that sort of seems to point to that as well.

Speaker 2:          01:22:15       Okay. So this, so this is now like really outside my area of expertise

Speaker 3:          01:22:20       and you some links to some of his stuff because he's been obsessed with this for about 30 years because fascinating guy.

Speaker 2:          01:22:26       The two things that would really surprise me about that. Firstly, just that there were so many ice ages and it was just seemed to be this. It comes on and goes off for sure. Yeah. Um, you know, fairly dynamic, predictable process where there's asteroid impact. Super Random. So you wouldn't expect to have this kind of back and forth then I make, if it was asteroids that was doing it. And then secondly, my understanding would be the asteroids would cool the planet because asteroid hits, ash just spreads out all over the sky that just blocks out sunlight. So it would surprise me if it had this kind of warming effect.

Speaker 3:          01:23:01       Well, I think the idea is that first of all, when it it, the impact is massive and it melts off just to the huge chunk of the amount of water that is a covering North America. Right? And that's one of the things that causes this massive flooding and this massive changing of the topography and as far as like what causes the net, I don't know if it interrupts it temporarily and then it comes back and gets warmer. But the, uh, that natural cycle of warming and cooling has been going on since they mean from as far back as they can measure it. What he's talking about. His significant quick changes. Also, the extinction event that killed somewhere around 65 percent or more of all of the large mammals in North America, really quickly, like bully mammoths really quickly. Saber Tooth Tigers, they don't know about that. That's, there's a lot of speculation back and forth about that because they would think that humans did it. But then they found these mass dead sites where they're not consumed. And uh, this was the ones that he showed where these woolly mammoths, they found them where they had their legs were broken and it looked like they just, the impact of something had knocked them flat and they'd found like thousands of them and these mass death side sites.

Speaker 1:          01:24:17       But I thought that the, um, so firstly it just seemed to me like the homo, the idea that humans killing them all just seems like crazy. Oh No, I thought it just seems like such a good explanation. They didn't even have. They had atlatl so, but then I was like, the best weapon they have at the time. They weren't even riding on horseback at the time. But then with respect to the death sites, I thought the mechanism for killing a woolly mammoth, you just got like 200 humans and you just chase the William mammoth, a cliff. So that does work if you can get them near a cliff. But the idea of getting them all near cliffs and killing them all off by a bunch of people that hadn't figured out the wheel seems a little unlikely. It's possible like over thousands of years because that's the thing.

Speaker 1:          01:24:55       Like we often tell these stories about, um, you know, these civilizations, humans, it's like, oh, and then they might relate to me, this journey to your left and so on. And often that's like they moved a mile of the uh, so it's like fate journeys actually just this very gradual. And certainly if you've got this grave site and it's got well, hundreds of woolly mammoths in this one place, that might be over thousands of years. I mean, again, this is just something I know that's the thing. They're talking about carbon dating, that they're all, it's all within the same time period. You'd have to really go over his stuff with a fine tooth comb and talked to him about it because I'm not the right guy. I just, I just listened to them and go woo, and then try to relate it as much as possible. There's a podcast that I actually read tweeted today because somebody brought it up on Youtube.

Speaker 1:          01:25:39       It's available, so I'll, I'll send you to it afterwards and see if you. What do you think about it? But. But this is something. Yeah, but if you know the book Sapiens, one of them, you're like the fifth person to talk about it. I've got to get everyone talks about savings savings is the book that wouldn't just pull it up a little closer to you because it makes a big difference in the sound, but yeah, one of the things that most blew my mind there was, yeah, how much megafauna there was in the early days of homosapiens moving across North America. There were two ton sloths, giant sloths and one of just vanity vanity. Many massive mega fauna that we just don't have anymore. Yeah. The blitzkrieg hypothesis is what they call the human animal, killing off all the other animals. It's a really troubling hypothesis because we don't want to think that we're capable of doing that, but obviously we do do that.

Speaker 1:          01:26:31       I mean, we're doing it right now. We did it to the buffalo and then we almost went to the Bison Dodo. We're doing it just a Tasmanian tiger. There's a lot of different animals that within our lifetime have gone extinct. I mean, where it actually like in terms of extinctions, um, I'm not sure if we'll get the number, but um, it would be pretty accurate to describe this as the fourth and make show mass extinction because it's just huge. The number of species have gone extinct. So this human activity and it's also one of those things where we don't think of it as being significant because it happens slowly over the course of many years. But if you look at it on a timeline, you're like, oh my God, look, everything's dying right now. Yeah, yeah, exactly. So it's slow by human standards fairly quick by nature, logical standards.

Speaker 1:          01:27:14       It's a fascinating subject. The end of the ice age happening so quickly, the animals dying off so quickly and so many large mammals dying off so quickly. So when you think about what we know people have done, like when we almost killed off the ice and they know why they did that, we know how they did that and they did it with extraordinary weapons and they did it with high powered rifles. They could shoot things from a far distance. They did it by shooting off trains. I mean they did a lot of crazy shit back then. So we understand mean and there's a lot of physical evidence. You. There's photographs of the actual piles of bones and all that crazy shit when you, when you take away those physical capabilities, the extraordinary physical capabilities like even riding on horseback. There's a guy named Dan Flores who's a fascinating guys, a scholar who believes that even without the Europeans coming over here and market hunting and killing off all the bison, he thinks just the firearm and the horse with the native Americans, it's entirely possible that they were going to eradicate the bison on their own.

Speaker 1:          01:28:20       I mean, again, it just depends about timescales, so even if you're just killing like slightly more of the species, like killing just enough of the species that they're now below the, you know, two children for every two minutes. Viability stage. Yeah, exactly. Then just over sufficient time and remembering the homo sapiens between the hunter gatherer age was 190,000 years. A very long time spans. Again, very short geologically. But um, yeah, a very long time span. So again, just a, you don't have to be killing that many woolly mammoth to delight them to extinction over the course of several thousand years. What are your, when it comes to like the ethical reintroduction of animals that have gone extinct? Like there are some people in Russia that are constant. They're currently rather working on some form of a woolly mammoth. We're going to take woolly mammoth DNA from some of these frozen bodies that they've gotten.

Speaker 1:          01:29:19       They've gotten some pretty intact woolly mammoths now and they're going to try to clone one. Yeah. So I don't know the details of how this will work. I guess they have to just stay to in an elephant, um, but I mean, I think it's like scientifically interesting. I don't think there's anything wrong with it, but what are they trying to make them like where you have woolly mammoths everywhere. Yeah. I mean, I think, um, I don't think there's any ethical imperative to do it. I think there's not a competitive. Not like I would think just if there's more wooly mammoths that's the same as just being more um, elephants and it might be a scientific interest. I heard, um, wild with like hypotheses that we heard and we're like, oh, that's cool. That sounds ridiculous. Um, yeah. I heard the idea was leading, introducing woolly mammoths to like stump down snow in order to prevent.

Speaker 1:          01:30:11       Yes. Prevent global warming. Global warming can slow it down somehow or another. Yeah. There's definitely things that sort of thing that people say over dinner, but yeah, with the idea wasn't just stomped down snow but also to eat the foliage. Okay. Yeah. There was like some exfoliating thing that they're doing where they would consume so many trees and so many plants that it would actually lower the temperature of the earth. What in the fuck? Yeah. Just seems skeptical of that. But I mean, there is this philosophical question of whether you should. So the question of biodiversity loss, um, which has been huge. Um, how do you value that? So is it the case that loss of a species, um, you can just cash that out in terms of impacts on individuals because obviously it's bad for the animals that die in the course of that and it's, we maybe have a loss of kind of information that we can just not get back.

Speaker 1:          01:31:12       But is there something intrinsically bad about just having fewer species and a lot of people seem to act to act in a way that suggests they seem to believe? Yes. Um, but it's hard. I think it's hard philosophically to cash that out. Um, I think it's hard to explain like why would we care so much about losing species where we don't seem to care about having, you know, deliberately randomizing. I'm bleeding and so on that we get more species. Um, it seems like we're only just conservative about not losing them, but if it really is a value to have greater diversity of species, why do we not actively find, promote greater amount of bio diversity of other merely preventing loss of biodiversity. The, I think the reintroduction,

Speaker 3:          01:32:00       the reintroduction of species. It also like if you have an environment that's stable, have you have some sort of an ecosystem that's stable and then you reintroduce a Predator or prey or some animal that's gonna eat up all the foliage. It's you, you're running this big risk and you're taking these big chances that you can sort of predict the future. You could look at a plus b equals c, but it doesn't always work that way and there has been disastrous result results when they've introduced species, um, to other environments where they're not native. Like, you know, what's going on with places like Australia. Australia is kind of hilarious in that regard.

Speaker 2:          01:32:38       Yeah. So they introduced the lab. No, the institute a type of flog to a slave. I'm going to butcher this as well, but the entities type of flag to Australia, it took over, so they introduced a lab at suitland, eat these blogs or something to eat the bugs and then they took over and didn't kill the bugs and I think they

Speaker 3:          01:32:54       more than boxes to try to kill the rabbits and they killed all the ground nesting birds and they introduce cats to kill the foxes and I mean you have to kill the rabbits. That's fact back ward attending introduced species, especially back then, you know when they were doing this in the 18 hundreds in Australia, they really didn't know what the fuck they were doing. They're thinking short term right in front of them and they also brought in a bunch of animals that don't have natural predators, so they have to gun them down from the fucking sky. I mean they have these, all these deer and stags and all these magic beasts. I mean if you ever seen a stag, they're incredible. They roar. They sound like a lion and they have so many of them in Australia and particularly in New Zealand, but they don't have any natural predators.

Speaker 3:          01:33:34       Zero, no predators, so they have to fly over and helicopters and gunned them down. It's just like. And they leave them. They just leave them to rot. They just have too many of them. Same with Kangaroos as well. Yeah. Yeah, because I've seen those herds of Kangaroos. He ever seen that? No, I haven't. Oh my God, there's a video that some guy took somewhere in Australia and it is thousands and thousands of kangaroos running across this field and it looks like a, like some apocalypse apocalyptic kangaroo invasion. See if you can find that Jamie the video just because it's worth seeing two to realize like, oh, this is what can happen when there's no predators. Like animals just get completely out of control.

Speaker 2:          01:34:17       Yeah, so I'm vegetarian and have been for a long time now, but with some other vegetarian fence we had the conversation of yeah, what would be the most ethical meat to eat and I think we can concluded that kangaroo would be the most ethical because it's being killed anyway because they just need to, like, you've got this population explosion. It's on land that wouldn't be otherwise used for anything, you know, haven't been fully. They've got good lives. Um, the environmental impact is therefore going to be um, you know, low or nonexistent as well. Um, obviously it, kangaroo meat is very unusual and almost all of those, the guards,

Speaker 3:          01:34:55       it's not though. Yeah, I mean it's very nutritious. Apparently

Speaker 1:          01:34:58       Kangaroos is actually a type of deer, believe it or not. Yeah. I don't believe that marsupial which has a totally different. It is, but it's related to the deer in some strict look at these fuckers just hanging out. This is not the one I'm talking about though. There's a bunch of them running across a field. This is just a large population of kangaroo. Yeah. Some way in the deer family and some strange way. See if Jamie could find that too. Do you know that we have wallabies in Scotland? Yeah, I know. Yeah. In an island called inch Konica. Yeah, I've heard of that. I've visited them a number of times. And were they introduced to Scotland? Yeah. So late the oven Kahuna had that bitch. Yeah. Well no need for that. So she, I'd actually don't know, but she owned, she owned the island. She owned the zoo on the island, like a personal zoo.

Speaker 1:          01:35:48       Um, and she, uh, died I think there lou the zoo went to back and everyone. So it just kind of was a while, but he's just got out and the wallabies took over. Yeah. First evidence because people wouldn't likely visited this was they would find these dead wallaby caucuses on the mainland and that was during the winter. The law, Scottish for lake would freeze over and the wallabies would hop on the ice when you get hit by a car, but then now very tame. It was a shame because I first found out about them back when it was still a bit of a seek. That was fascinating and now it's become a bit of a tourist hotspot. Wow.

Speaker 4:          01:36:30       Says that Kangaroos are marsupials and more closely related to possums than deer. Oh, okay. So they're not related to dear mean. Correct. Yeah. Someone had told me that there were in some way in the deer family or cousins of deer or something like that. Early explorers said that they were just what their descriptions were. They were like deers without antlers and they stood up. Right. Like men, but a salsa. I mean, it's a cure a question. So I didn't find like an official scientist saying here's deciding on it, but uh,

Speaker 1:          01:36:59       yeah, that's what I wish I had this my whole life. Someone who could just follow me around and correct me if the time I say something about this, this is an amazing time. Somebody puts something up on instagram today and it was a a quote from the 18 hundreds about an ancient philosopher or an ancient scholar rather would give his life for the information that's available to the common school boy today, and this was from a quote from 18, 88. Wow. Which is nothing now compared to what we can do. Yeah. I think there was another statistic, and again it's unclear how do you measure this, but in terms of letting the information, at least one newspaper has yet more letting the information in it than a typical person in the 17 hundreds would be exposed to for the entire lifetime. I wonder what. What was the natural Predator of Kangaroos? Because kangaroos are. They're a native animal to Australia and if they

Speaker 3:          01:37:56       didn't, do you know, there was a giant Predator in New Zealand at least at one point in time. It was called the Haast Eagle and it was an enormous eagle. The biggest eagle. They think that ever lived and had something like a 10 foot wingspan and they believe that even hunted people who have huge, huge eagle and it's a part of the. I guess it's the Mowery, it's a part of their ancient mythology and they found out that it is actually a real animal. That was somewhere around the 14 hundreds was made extinct through hunting.

Speaker 1:          01:38:27       My understanding was in Australia before humans invaded crocodiles. My understanding was it was just no major predators for um, that's the Tasmanian Tiger

Speaker 3:          01:38:40       thylacine yeah. They call that thing the Tasmanian Tiger that died during human, like modern Thompson's. It's a crazy looking picture, but it's face will get that mouth on that thing. Jesus Christ. But that I believe those things

Speaker 1:          01:38:55       died off in the cities. I just typed this in here, this, that it's now extinct, but the Dingo is probably the more Predator they had.

Speaker 3:          01:39:03       When did it die? Thylacine is now extinct. However, humans arrived in Australia at least 50,000 years ago and introduced the Dingo about 5,000 years ago. So maybe those things were tank Kangaroos were a big part of Kangaroos, I guess would probably catching them when they're not with. They're young, but they carry their young inside their body in that pouch, which makes them different from any other kind of animal that it would be prey because they can take care of their young and bounce away quickly.

Speaker 1:          01:39:30       Well, this is why. So in terms of large mammals, humans killed every single type of large mammal other than Kangaroos in Australia. I think they were kind of hundreds of different types of originally. Oh, there's a bunch of different things other than Kangaroos. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Like what again, I don't know, maybe giant Koalas, let's say. Um, but, uh, yeah. And, and my understanding was the reason for that was because they didn't have natural predators. Um, and so they just didn't know what to do with people. So that makes sense to have all of these defensive mechanisms there and also have wolves and coyotes and bears and all these different things that are chasing them down. That's interesting that the concept of what's the most ethical thing to eat. I would think you would think it would be like mollusks. Okay. So that's. Yeah. So I do think it's totally fine to eat anything. Well, what I say is I don't eat anything with a plane. So that means the oysters mussels, clams they have. Okay. Yeah. I'm sorry, I got convinced I didn't use to be like this. I got convinced by. I'm an advocate for gets called by valve veganism. I mean it's not, doesn't make a big difference. I don't really like these things. Eat them occasionally, but you don't like, like muscles. No. Really? Yeah. No. Have you ever had linguine with muscles? Like at a good Italian restaurant with a, a nice red sauce?

Speaker 2:          01:40:54       Yeah. I mean, so when they're good, define and when the bad really bad in that case with everything. No. Some things when they're good they can grows hamburgers. I mean, you, you can get down the line, you know, you could rotten food. No, but like, you know, good pizza is just amazing pizza or like, um, like I feel like my, the fatty best muscles. I'm like mad towards a really? Yeah. Oh man, you need to go to a really good Italian restaurant. I ever had linguine with clams, do like clams. So again, I just feel I feel pain differently. Bedroom. Oh, she's crazy. You just need to go to a really good restaurant. You guys are eating in England, man. That's the problem. They don't know how to make Italian food there. Yeah, that's the great Indian. I mean there's a few people right now.

Speaker 2:          01:41:37       They're screaming in England, oh, I'm a good Italian. So you son of a bitch. I'm generalizing and I'm aware I'm an ignorant and saying that, but I can't defend English. Cuisine. Great. Having been out to New York, San Francisco, London has some amazing restaurants now. London does. You know what I mean? But it was always the generalized stereotypical knock. Was it? The Food in England was terrible the first time I went there. It was pretty bad. But yeah, with respect to what's the most ethical meat? I think it is a really interesting question because I think, you know the debate and vegetarianism and so on. It's normally face to this either or thing like not doing anything or just go vegetarian or Vegan. Um, but I was interested in this question of just, yeah, well supposedly you only want to go halfway or of the different foodstuffs, like what are the, what are the ones that are going to do the most in terms of animal welfare if you cut them out?

Speaker 2:          01:42:29       Because most people when they go halfway to being vegetarian, they might cut red meat, beef and so on. And I actually think if you care the least about the animal welfare side of things, I think that's just long and I think there's two reasons for that. One is a one, it's the respect to the amount of suffering that the animal has in the course of its life where the way that chickens are couldn't lead to the tip. If you look at just average, and again we're talking about most Checkins, the, you're talking about factory farming, fish farming conditions, which is well over 90 percent. I think 99 percent of chickens they've eaten other than these conditions that life's just, I think they're the worst stuff. Creatures on the planet basically. Um, and cows I think often don't have great lives, but it's just nothing really compared to chickens. And I think poker is similar, like pigs also have really terrible lives. Um, whereas yeah, large animals, cows, a sheep just in general aren't being treated as badly. And then the second question is, um, how many animals are you affecting where if you, um, consumer steak or something that's like a thousandth of account when I finished, whereas you can easily eat kind of half a chicken and that's a factor that people normally don't consider those as well. And obviously maybe you value a cow's

Speaker 1:          01:43:52       life later than a chicken's life or something. We do in some strange way the hierarchy that you have almost inherently, or at least we do in the western world. Yeah, I think it was really hard to know, like this is one of the hottest philosophical question I've thought about phages and have essentially given up on this. You've got an unhappy cow day and unhappy chicken tell you which is, which is where I had to wait. Those two can't or an unhappy fish. People have very few feelings about fish. Let me, you see a dead fish. People don't feel the same way. They feel if you see a dead lamb. Yeah. But in general life become more sympathetic. I think there's a bias where we tend to sympathize more with things that look like us. Fish have these weird kind of look. They don't take care of the young too.

Speaker 1:          01:44:34       That's cute. Yeah. And so over time I've definitely become a lot more sympathetic to taking suffering of chickens and fish fairly seriously. Um, and I, I think when you combine these two factors of, um, again, yeah, fish, I think except that there's less good information on them. But um, I think this might be in the category, but certainly chickens and pigs compared to beef. I actually think if you just want to kill, like take out most of the suffering from your diet, removing chickens, cage, then caged eggs. I think in the US actually that's basically all x, unless you can show them yourself. Um, and pork, I think you're the moving and maybe fish. I think you moving most of the suffering from your diet vastly more than when it comes to before milk. Yeah. Well in terms of the amount of individuals that get impacted your writing, that one cow can feed much more people obviously then one chicken cancer.

Speaker 1:          01:45:29       So if you're taking one life and that form, what disturbs me most about factory farming? Well, for one thing that disturbs me, it sort of existed and then I found out about it and it was already there and I had been eating it all along and that shocked me in that I was sitting. I remember sitting back, I'd watched some documentary on it and I remember sitting back thinking like, this happened because we weren't paying attention because I was a grown man. When I found out about it, I hadn't been paying attention. And when you leave people alone and you say, hey man, do you think you can get us some beef? That guy's like, yeah, yeah, yeah, I got it. Don't worry about it. You just stay over there and your city. I'll take care of it over here. Out of sight, out of mind, and then when we find out about it and then you hear about in America we have these things called ag gag laws. I'm sure you're aware. It's unbelievable. Like no possible justification for this terrifying. It's just because. So yeah. Whets their hiding information. Hiding information. Yeah, and there was a case where there was an animal welfare activists goes into a factory farm is filming instances of animal cruelty for of documentary film that gets presented and she got fired and had to go to prison for not intervening in the animal cruelty. That was just happening all the time and she was, the person is actually about. So she got tried for intervening,

Speaker 3:          01:46:50       not stopping the animal cruelty. We just haven't to maintain all of the time. I thought she would get tried for violating the AG gag laws. No. Well she was an invasion of privacy on the corporation. The corporate secrets. Yeah. I think it was applied to the Ad Guy Louis. Oh. So they found another way to try to discourage that. Yeah. So that's so insane.

Speaker 2:          01:47:10       But the thing you said earlier, which when you're talking about the ways in which humans are broken, I think if you just look at, yeah, suffering the humans of inflicting now the thing that's really wanting is how mechanized it's become. So if imagine if. Yeah, there was even, let's say a chicken just like here in front of us. I ain't just for fun, just kick it. Um, people would be outraged. People would just think I'm this kind of despicable person and that's the natural reaction because I'm just inflicting unnecessarily suffering on this creature. But then you can just modify the circumstances such that this natural emotional reaction of sympathy just fades away where now it's this huge warehouse and it's not just one chicken. It's hundreds of thousands of chicken and it's all mechanized and it's all taken out of sight. I'm suddenly. Yeah, I mean just Stalin said, yeah, single death is a tragedy, a million deaths statistic, um, and life lessons for them stolen. But, um, uh, it's an extremely good quote,

Speaker 3:          01:48:18       but he was telling about humans and you know, any death of a human will be tragedy and when, when they get to large numbers, it's sort of, it's very difficult to calculate because it's hard for people to understand or grasp the concept of a million people dying. What's bizarre about factory farming is that it's all kind of done behind these warehouse walls. It's all undercover and it's all incredibly common and it's all not discussed. This was happening. Mike was going to say the wars happening and 100,000 people a month are dying or discussing how do we mitigate this? How do we stop this? How do we, how do we bring peace? There's so few people wondering how to stop chicken suffering.

Speaker 2:          01:49:09       Yeah, absolutely. I mean because we've looked into this and one of the reasons it's such a priority area is just the amount of just philanthropic money going into this when it's. The focus is clearly on factory farming, not sled dogs and so on. It's in the low tens of millions of dollars

Speaker 3:          01:49:25       trying to stop factory farming. Yeah. Or trying to mitigate it, what is the solution like other than going vegetarian, vegetarian, when have we reached this point? So sort of like unmanageable point where the population centers like Los Angeles, New York, whatever, that don't grow their own food and have gotten so massive that in order to fuel these people with food, especially with, with animal protein, you almost have, have these setups.

Speaker 1:          01:49:48       Yeah, I mean I think if you've got the constraint of animal protein, I mean, I think the answer's probably still no, but the other thing is you just don't need that constraint of animal protein. We eat way more meat than we did. Um, you know, 50 years ago, 100 years ago, I'm far more than we need to have a healthy diet. I mean, I've been vegetarian 11 years. Do you eat eggs though? Free range eggs? Um, yeah, I do. Um, that's for me. I don't understand when people don't like when Peter had that whole campaign about eggs or chickens periods, I'm like, look, I can understand you not wanting to eat factory farmed chickens, eggs because these animals are tortured and they're confined and it's horrific, but you can definitely find eggs and I have my own chickens. I have 22 chickens and they lay eggs and I eat their eggs all the time and I ate five of them this morning.

Speaker 1:          01:50:37       They're great, but when you're talking about those eggs, there's. There's no suffering. The eggs come out, they don't become a chicken. You take them. It's free and those chickens, by the way, there are a bunch of little murderers. They run around my yard. I've seen them eat a mouse before. If they found a bird that was down like a, like a nesting bird that had fallen out of a nest, they'll fuck that bird up. Anything that's on the ground. The only thing they don't seem to like, they don't seem to like slugs. Okay. You've tried to feed them? No, they eat them. We pick up a rock in my garden. I'll pick up a rock and they should have come over and just jack anything that's under the rock. They figured out that when I lift up the Rock, there's bugs under there, there a little murderers, man, they're ruthless.

Speaker 1:          01:51:22       They don't like slugs. They try them and then they start shaking their head. They tried to get the slime off their beak and it kind of freak out. Yeah. So yeah, I mean, this, this big within the animal welfare kind of animal activists, this is actually quite big divide between, um, you could call them maybe the abolitionists to one side and the feminists and the abolitionists. The view is just, you know, animal. The way we treat animals is like how we treated slaves. This is just, this is kind of the equivalent of slavery. The amount of time and the only end, you know, imagine if we'd been in slave owning Americans had like, Hey, well why don't we just cut down the number of slaves? It's just not doing nothing. They'll model csns, um, the welfare lists in contrast, a more like, look almost oldest something.

Speaker 1:          01:52:10       If we're going to quantify the soft thing of the way humans, the animals know 99 percent of it comes from factory farms. If we could eliminate and factory farms, sure, there's still something left. It's not like even if you could a went on the kind of final stage, but this is where the vast majority of both the animals used under the worst conditions are. And so the welfare would instead say, look, let's literally just focus all of that attention on this and things like theater and eggs or services or um, for just these are just literally kind of not the main issue. And um, you know, I'm naturally most sympathetic to the kind of welfare perspective.

Speaker 2:          01:52:46       Um, but it is interesting of the animal. I know lots of people who were in the welfare this camp and then moved to the abolitionists camp on welfare. The clowns were. The kind of Wiley is just that. If you're just an to get people to do a little, then you're not actually going to move them at all. Whereas you need to have this hard moral line and then people kind of see the integrity of that follow up.

Speaker 3:          01:53:07       Well, it seems to me that there's a slippery slope when agriculture and civilization were introduced that someone wasn't going to exploit it to the nth degree and finger while it's just got to be a better way to squeeze money out of this situation. And then next thing you know, you've got these factory pig farms. Sure. You've seen those horrific one where they fly the drone over the lakes of pig pis and pig shit. Absolutely. That these animals are living just completely confined where they can't even turn around and they're just pumping them up with whatever the fuck they need to keep them alive until they get to a certain point where they can kill them. Yeah,

Speaker 2:          01:53:39       and it is through people. So many people would be. Absolutely. If that was lightly and fund, it would be second.

Speaker 3:          01:53:45       Yeah. Hence the AG gag laws. In order to keep that money coming in, they have to keep people in the dark of these situations unless they go online and seek it out and watch these videos. And those videos are very polarizing too because, you know, when you come to a lot of these animal rights organizations, a lot of them have roots in the Animal Liberation Organization, which doesn't even believe that you should have pets. They think that your pets are all prisoners.

Speaker 2:          01:54:11       Yeah. It's so interesting. Going back to Peter Singer were, you said the animal liberation, which was the name of his book, which was kind of text founding text for what became the animal rights movement. And what's interesting is the singer doesn't believe in rights. He's a consequentialist. CC, utilitarian. Never used the word once. So what he, his approach would just be thinking, yeah, what's going to do the most good. Um, and on the pets question, um, no, don't want to speak for Peter, but he's going to think, well, if they have a good life and the world teetered just seems fine. Men, he'd want to say like, the focus should be on suffering. Yeah. On the huge, vast magnitudes of suffering that goes on in factory farms. That's with one, two, three, and four.

Speaker 3:          01:54:52       Yeah. I have a hard time even entertaining the conversation that there's something wrong with a healthy pet dog like that dog loved the owner. The people love the dog and the dog has obviously gone through an incredible evolutionary process where it's gone from being a wolf to being a Chihuahua. Like if you think that thing should be out fending for itself and the forest boy, you're dooming that little fucker to death. Well, the question that dog in all of these cases, like the animals wouldn't exist otherwise and that wouldn't exist from people. I mean if it wasn't for people breeding them and making them this bulldog like this thing that can't even hardly breathe and walks with a wattle like we're weird that we've done that in the first year place.

Speaker 2:          01:55:32       Yeah, I mean I find especially the pets like dogs that have. Yeah, like difficulty thing, genetic diseases. I find it kind of goes like this, gross that we've kind of done that. I've gotten one. What type of

Speaker 3:          01:55:43       dog do you have? A Shibu Ino English bulldog mix. Some poor little fucker. He's a mess. We got him as a puppy, you know, because he was cute and he just seemed like it needed a home and we took Amanda. God, he's all messed up man. I mean I've had them for 10 years. He said all these surgeries and can't walk right? His hips are all fucked up. He's just like, they breed them to the point where he's half sheebu. He knows he's actually better off than a lot of bulldogs because he's 12 now. I don't think bulldogs usually live that long. I don't think they lived to that age, but he's got all sorts of difficulties. Can't really run. No, he's lazy. He just likes to lay down snore. But the poor little things like if you look at an actual, like legit English bulldog with their flat faces, like they have massive respiratory problems and yeah.

Speaker 3:          01:56:31       So I find that like the fact that we like engaged in this paddock, depleting them kind of weird. But then like, yeah, if you're going to have a dog and look after that, well like it's not the problem. And so this, this question is just if you're talking about that, oh you just like distracting from the main issue which is coming. So seems to me that, that this is just like everything else in life, like as you go down the rabbit hole and you look at a deeper and deeper and deeper, you go, God, this is a complicated issue. You know, how do you get all these people to stop eating so much meat so that you don't need so much meat so that you don't need factory farming and have to get people aware of what is the consequences of going and buying a chicken sandwich?

Speaker 3:          01:57:11       Well, do you know where that chicken came from? Here? Check this out. Are you happy now? And a lot of people, they watched those videos and then they'd go, ah, fuck it, I'm hungry. I want a chicken sandwich. Yeah, lots of people do. I do think though, like so in the UK at least if you buy a pack of cigarettes, you get these pictures on them showing kind of what this is, what the lungs will look like if you smoke 20 a day and those warnings and things. Yeah. That doesn't stop people in some weird way. I mean people are addicted to sick of that so I think it must have some impact, but I wonder it does. If you could buy a pack of chicken and you'd say, well this is, this is this field of piss and shit. That chicken grew up in.

Speaker 3:          01:57:46       Right? Like the opposite of an ag gag law. Like force it in your face because look, I mean you're just giving the consumer more information. Having that. Like if you went to the butcher shop, went to the butcher section in the grocery store and there was videos that were playing constantly above the package meat that showed these animals getting like a piston through the head, hanging by their ankles and getting bled out while they kicked. Oh, and how many people that would be a fucking conveyor belt of baby mail checks falling into this. I'm getting ground up. That would be a fascinating psychological examination to watch people walk up to that butcher shop and see those videos playing. Like if that became the law. Yeah, I mean there's, there's an amazing. It was a comedy sketch show that um, did something kind of similar, which was the bill would go up to

Speaker 2:          01:58:42       the butcher's counter and say, okay, I'd like some sausages. They go, okay, pick up a little baby pig at good to, into this box. This box is obviously fake. And just like, do this action in sausages would come out. Obviously they're not actually getting it right and people will be out late and it's like, no web. She not know where pork comes down. So yeah, that's the thing that's just amazing is how people can call themselves an animal lovers. Well there's also

Speaker 3:          01:59:11       people that love animals and eat meat, like they'll eat steak and then get mad at people for hunting animals. I've, I've experienced that personally.

Speaker 2:          01:59:20       This is a good case though, of the salient issue where, um, I mean, so I have like a post hunting and bad fandom that gets killed, but the thing is it's so salient compared to factually farming and it's like, you know what, I prefer that people hung meat other than like factory farming. It's like, of course, and like you do the math, it's like not only am I behind that and behind that like a thousand times. Again, the hunting is just, it's this fairly salient thing, you know, in the UK, a huge uproar about fox hunting and so on. But that's a different thing because fox hunting, you're not, you're not eating it now. I mean it's supposed to be for. Yeah. It's Kinda like I'm in control.

Speaker 3:          01:59:58       Yeah. And there's some, there's some logic to that that if you don't have natural predators, you need to figure out some way to control certain populations that can be damaging like Fox or in some places black bear. And there's a bunch of different animals that you do have to control because they don't have, they don't have a natural predator.

Speaker 2:          02:00:15       Yeah. Yeah. But the thing that's like incredible for me, it's just how people can have such long views on that and such long views on hunting and then just eat me know the actions effectively. Farming. Yeah. They just don't see it, you know, it is just because we have value manipulable. Is he in terms of a model, the action.

Speaker 3:          02:00:34       Well there's obviously a wedding because there's certain that you have. There are certain animals that you have to control the populations of less, especially invasive species like pigs, like wild pigs are huge problem in America and getting bigger and bigger. I know you guys don't have them as much in the UK, but in, in America, particularly in Texas and now in northern California, which is a massive, massive populations of wild pigs and they give birth two to three times a year and they can give birth to as many as three to six piglets in each lit and they just caught and then six months later those piglets are ready to give birth. So they just boom, boom, boom, boom. And if you don't control their populations, what are you gonna do you're gonna like let wolves lose to control their populations. I mean they have to figure out how to do it, and so they've taken to a lot of the same strategies that they're using in New Zealand that we talked about, what stags in Texas, they have these helicopter hunts where they fly around in helicopters just gunned down hundreds and hundreds of these pigs and they do wind up donating the meat of that pigs to homeless shelters and people who need it and it.

Speaker 3:          02:01:39       It's actually very nutritious and very healthy and very good for you and that's probably way better than buying pig from someone who's raised it in some horrific factory farming environment. But for people that just want the animals to live and be unchallenged in on, on preyed upon, I get it. They all seemed very disturbing, but you got to control the populations because you're not going to have any agriculture. They're going to find out where the farms are and they tear them apart at night. They're nocturnal animals. You can't stop them with fences. They go right through fences, they're huge, huge animals, wild pigs create millions of dollars of damage in Riverside County. Wow. That's. That's like Riverside county's like super populated, but this is a. it's an enormous, enormous problem in this country and by the way, when you look at that animal, what's really cool about pigs is that they morph.

Speaker 3:          02:02:30       When you see that animal, it looks very different than a domestic pig, but it's exact same animal. They're all the same genus, so called [inaudible], and when you take a domestic pig and you let it go within months, within months of being free, their hair starts to change. Their snouts starts to elongate. Their tusks start to grow longer. They, once they become feral, once they realize they have to fend for themselves, there's an actual physiological change in the structure of their body. So it's fascinating. So it's really crazy. Their hair gets thicker, they develop a thicker plate the males do around the chest to protect themselves from other males when they fight. It's bizarre. So those wild pigs that people see, there's a bunch of different kinds. Some of them are Russian boars are wild, you know, the different, different kind of a pig, but ultimately they all interbreed with each other.

Speaker 3:          02:03:24       It's just so interesting as well. Coming back to the question of what's natural and so on, people often think about meat that a thing as well where if you look at the chickens can barely stand because they've been so engineered, huge blasts, you know, pigs that you're talking about like, uh, not meant to be pink to be blown, you know, cows just can you really imagine a cow like evolving in the wild are like, of course not all of these things that can edibly unnatural through thousands of years of a selective leading. Well crap cows don't live in the wild, but here's where it gets interesting. In Australia, when cows have gotten wild, they've gotten loose from these pens that people held them in and then they become what they call scrub bowls and they're out there in the wild and people hunt them like they would hunt a wild animal and they're very wary and they run from people.

Speaker 3:          02:04:18       They see people that get the fuck out of there and the bowls are incredibly violent, like the, the male cows. These scrub bowls are some of the most dangerous things to hunt in the world because they'll actively chase you down like a bull, like, you know, if you see like people trying to ride bowls and bowls kick and they go crazy. All these scrub bowls are essentially those bowls, but many, many, many generations. Wild. So they're feral bowls. Answer. Yeah. And so they, they sort of were bred to be this domestic thing and then they got loose and then they became this wild thing and so they look slightly differently. That's what they look like. That's a scrub bull. So they're becoming slowly over the course of many generations are more wild animal. So they, they have these hunts for these scribbles and if that thing sees you, by the way, that crazy look and bowl, they will fuck you up.

Speaker 3:          02:05:15       There are some of the most dangerous animals that you can encounter in the wild apparently. But, uh, I have a buddy, my friend Adam. Yeah. They look different. Like look at the Hump on its back, I mean that looks like some crazy wild African animal and it was originally a long time ago of regular domestic cow, so it shows just how officially they are, if that's just, if that's the sort of changes you get over just the course of a few generation natural selection as opposed to what we're doing with dogs. You know when we create a bulldog, I mean that is, those are the animals that have survived and and they've changed their coloration. Their physical structure looks different in over many, many generations. It's quite, quite fascinating. Yeah. It's like we have to figure out where we stand I think in terms of the entire ecosystem, because we're certainly not viable.

Speaker 3:          02:06:06       We can't go out there and live amongst those animals. I mean we won't, we'll get killed, will get eaten. We so we have to stay inside of our homes. We have to stay inside of our environments and then we have to figure out like how much of an impact should we have on those things around us. Should we be like all the other animals, like all the wolves and all these other animals, the coyotes that have this impact on the environment or should we try to lessen our footprint to the point where we have zero impact on any of the animals and we just live inside of these sustained areas that grow vegetation. It's, um, it's an interesting question because those animals prey on each other. They all do. And like, what should we be a part of that? Should we take place? Should we take part in that?

Speaker 3:          02:06:47       I definitely don't think we should factory farm. I definitely think that that was a huge mistake and I also definitely think that that huge mistake is what led us to be able to have these gigantic cities and I don't think necessarily cities are a huge mistake, but man, trying to figure out how to feed those people in the way that they're accustomed to eating right now. There's a, that's a massive, massive battle. Yeah. But I think the kind of question of large populations and how do you feed them, that massively tells in favor of flow and meat consumption or vegetation or because you've got this 10 to one little way to create a category of meat. You need 10 calories or more of, um, of they ignore soliah wherever you're feeding them, unless you're dealing with people just consuming wild pigs. Yeah. Wild pigs. Oh, Kangaroos or something with no exceptions to that as well. But, but I think there's enough to feed people though. That's the other thing. There's 350 million people in this country. There's not $350 million wild pigs. Yeah, exactly.

Speaker 2:          02:07:44       Um, but it means that in the future, just as populations get larger than. Yeah. Again, we're just going to need to use, um, landon energy more efficiently. So this is yet another argument in favor of a plant based diet.

Speaker 3:          02:08:00       Yeah. Well, in America at least, the majority, the vast majority of the money that goes towards conservation, towards keeping wild animal populations high is actually from hunting. It's a real strange contradiction that makes people really uncomfortable once they find it out, is that the vast majority of the money that goes to present protect habitat to preserve wild lands. It comes from hunting. In fact, hunters voluntarily agreed, I believe it was in the 19 thirties, to give up 10 percent. I want to make sure that number's right too, but have the the money in terms of the percentage of sales of hunting equipment goes directly towards conservation. There's all these things. Yeah, there's all these different entities like the Rocky Mountain Elk Federation that have repopulated elk into all these areas, but done so specifically so that people can hunt them so it gets really weird, like it might be an uneasy alliance between in many people's eyes, but they're the ones that are giving up the money. The money is not coming from altruistic organizations. It just want to preserve these animals so that they can exist in the free wild way that they did before people got here. But there's more white tail deer in America today that when Columbus landed so and that's all because of conservation, because of hunting. So it's another one of those weird things where at the whole picture,

Speaker 2:          02:09:25       yeah, there's a solution that's I've heard suggested for reducing species loss, which is to um, allow basically ownership of species. So you can copy the panda. I'm now, isn't this a weird idea? But the idea is that then now suddenly, like at the moment, no one has a financial incentive, um, to ensure that pandas don't go extinct. Whereas if someone were able to say, no, I have, if you want to use a panda and video or so and you have to pay the owner.

Speaker 3:          02:09:59       Yeah. Well I'm very uncomfortable with the idea of this laboratory created meet as to where that's going to go. Why are you uncomfortable? I'm very positive about it. I mean the science is kind of tricky, but I'm positive about it and that it's not gonna be any animal suffering. It's going to be fascinating in that regard. But what's going to happen if we find out that, well, there's a bunch of different things, right? First of all, we have to make sure that it's healthy. We have to make sure that it doesn't cause some sort of a weird disease because you're not eating something that's living and moving and when you meet sedentary creatures, maybe there's some sort of an adverse impact on our biology because I think there's an adverse impact when you eat protein from an animal that is weak and sick and they've actually shown that.

Speaker 3:          02:10:44       Um, there was a study that Dr Rhonda Patrick sent me recently that showed that animals that eat older sick animals die quicker. They have a shorter lifespan and in exhibit less health characteristics, I believe it was than animals that ate younger animals and there seems to be some sort of a direct correlation between eating younger healthy things and having a positive impact on, on physical life itself, the animal that's consuming it and that if you're eating something that never existed in the first place, like what? Unless they're able to recreate the characteristics of a healthy animal, like a strong muscle tissue. Like maybe they could do that with electrical impulses, like some sort of electrical muscles. Muscular stimulation.

Speaker 2:          02:11:35       Yeah. I don't see why that would be a problem. I mean, at least you'd think you'd be able to get past that in fact, where, you know, the meat that we've currently got stuffed full of antibiotics, um, you know, there's a often viruses that or

Speaker 3:          02:11:50       why this is the kind of aligned swine flu, flu, flu. Exactly. You could avoid all of them with all that. All that stuff comes from factory farm and in fact.

Speaker 2:          02:11:58       Yeah. And in fact then once you start to engineer meet, perhaps you could engineer exactly the healthiest sort of meat you've got so much more control over the product. There'll be crazy. Of course you've got to, yeah, with development of any new technology, you've got to be a cautious about it. Um, but ultimately it seems like we should be able to get to the point where we have tastier, cheaper, more healthy meat that uses far less carbon like has far less carbon dioxide as a side effect uses far less land area. It's going to be better than every single way. And I mean, I think the science, it does seem hard in particular just to get the costs down low enough.

Speaker 3:          02:12:42       Well, I think they've got it down pretty low. I mean there was a recent article about it, whether we're talking about the original one was worth hundreds of thousands of dollars and now they've got it down to like 20 bucks.

Speaker 2:          02:12:50       Yeah, I think that was misleading wasn't. Yeah, it's a shame. It seemed to me like there's a, been a little bit too much hype in between, um, where. Yeah, there's some stories of like the costs a lot of [inaudible] going down. Whereas, um, it's definitely much lower than that. I think it's definitely still decades away, decades. Yeah, I think so. Really what makes you think decades? So the argument is that the currently the, so it depends on what you're talking about. I'm like, egg white I think is Pez competitively. Um, milk is comparatively easy but structured meet so you know, steak or chicken that has a structure. Um, that's,

Speaker 1:          02:13:32       I think very difficult and I think apparently part of what the difficulty is there's a certain solution that you need to go with this meat and, and that solution is currently very expensive. Um, and the key part of the cost and even once we get to the point of being able to develop this, getting the costs down low enough so it's, it's competitive, you're going to need to take this. I'm fluid that currently costs, I don't know how much, like a thousand dollars a liter liter get it down to the cost of soda and we don't currently, it seems like a clear kind of scientific who would be the ultimate Turner Syndrome if they found out that the only way to make that fluid and to make it financially viable is to make it out of ground up. Pets will get killed anyway. Euthanized pet. So at liquid people be upset if they took euthanize pets and they used it to make the fluid to grow the artificial meeting or would they prefer those euthanize pets just be cremated?

Speaker 1:          02:14:26       So at the moment that fluid does have to come from animals. Certain parts of it that is animal based was just guessing. Um, so it's not exactly, um, ground up pets. I'm just, I understand it's still currently not Vegan, but it's interesting. I think it's going to change. I mean I do think given the level of just model cognitive dissonance that's currently going on, people's attitudes to animals, pets, any animal they can see and consumption of meat. Once you take self infest out of the equation, once you've got meat that is cheaper and just as tasty, I think just everyone's going to switch and then within a generation people will look back at the current generation and just think, how did anyone ever engage in such abominable activity as factory farmed meat? Yeah. Well it's probably one of the darkest things that we as a civilized humanity do.

Speaker 1:          02:15:23       When you. When you think about other than war, which is obviously the most horrific thing or one of the most horrific things. I mean it's arguable that in terms of suffering, it's the next thing because it's. I mean it has to be the, it is the next thing, right? So other than poisoning people for profit, you know, other than companies that have polluted environments that have won a poisoning people. Yeah. So in terms of animals, so 50 billion animals are killed every year for human consumption. Want worldwide, most of them have kind of short life. So a layer. No, broiler hens have six week lives. That's crazy. Six weeks. So from the time they're incubated to the time they're in a oven six weeks, that's not. Yeah. And I think that nuts, the point at which they die is that the highlight of their life and my view, because their life is just filled with suffering. And uh, so that means any at any one time, the 7 billion animals in factory farms now living basically being tortured for the entirety of their short lives. So the entire population of the human race, it's basically one to one yet at any one time, isn't nuts

Speaker 2:          02:16:30       that, that's less than 100 years old. Yet much less than that. Less than 50 years old. Fifty years old. Really? That's the first crazy asshole that jammed those chickens, those little cages, Henley field. I think that's the guy. His name. So he fascinating it of the free marketeers. Um, so back in the fifties I'm getting, I'm going to go into a digression, but it's not as bad as the affinity. I promise you. They're all awesome. So back in the fifties I'm free market economics was just completely dead. That was just not a mainstream idea toll within academic economics, but it really, if I was to prominence acos end of the sixties, certainly the seventies and then fetch and logan getting empowered, huge uptake in this intellectual movement. And so the question is kind of where did it come from? And it was actually very significantly driven by a small number of people in the fifties and early sixties.

Speaker 2:          02:17:27       Like very deliberately saying, okay, I want, we want this ideology to become really dominant. And one of the most important first organizations was the institute for Economic Affairs based in London, I think tank and it was funded by the person who put the factory farm chicken to listen. So, um, it's weird because I promote this idea of I'm earning to give as something that young people should consider. No, it's the only thing that they should do. But as one of many things they should do, a should consider doing. If you want to do good, you could go and like directly have an impact. But there is also another option which is doing something you're really passionate about that maybe has less of a direct impact on a lot and donate, um, what you're making at least a significant part of that to the things you think are most important. And then I think of this, I think it's Henry Fisher, sorry. This is like this most perverse instantiation of that where the guy went, became a factory farming entrepreneur. Basically any ticket I give glands. And so, uh,

Speaker 3:          02:18:32       isn't that just so indicative of how humans are so contradictory were so complex and so strange and that we will find all these justifications for all these bizarre behaviors. And then we were never like totally pure. Like there's so many, so many people that are so that. This is a terrible example, but it's the one I use all the time. Bill cosby made so many people laugh and he raped about $100 or whatever. Allegedly, you know, like he was helping and putting out so much love to so many people and then being fucking evil to a bunch of people that he drug.

Speaker 2:          02:19:10       Yeah. Or if they just know that this exists, this duality that they think about Nazi Germany, you think about the number of people who are involved in the Holocaust, who loved their children and their children, and if you talk to them, you would have had a great conversation. They would have been very caring and so on. This is, I mean, yeah, it's a very powerful idea. The banality of evil. I'm having events phase where, yeah, the worst crimes committed and not because people are bad. It's because [inaudible] not bad or evil in the way that you think James Bond villain like this person's plotting something. It's just because they have some goal that is some goal in which they indifference to suffering and the cause that as a side effect. And so it's the same if you ask people, do you want animals to suffer that ethically in factory farms will say, no, of course not. It's just I don't care. Casualties of war. Exactly. And casualties of civilization. And the same insight actually when we talk about ai as well as, um, you know, sometimes in the media people say, oh, the worry about ai as a terminator, it's going to want to kill humans, but that's not the wedding at all. The idea when you think about homo sapiens and neanderthals, again, it's just having some other entity that has goals on which you are just not very important. Right. Um, and that means that, yeah,

Speaker 1:          02:20:34       well, and they're also going to judge us. I mean, if they are intelligent and they are superior to us, they're going to judge us based on the entire, whole of our behavior. And they're going to go look at this messy species. This species is crazy. Elon mucks mosque has my most terrifying quote. Uh, he, his quote is the most terrifying to me that he thinks that with ai we are summoning the demon king, the demon. Yeah. I love that quote. That's just like. I mean, I want A. Yeah. Like I think a lot of the media attention around ai is like, has been really unfortunate because it suggests like it's coming next year and it's gonna Control. It's like the demon. I think anthropomorphized is necessarily and so on, sort of I think, but if it's ultimate goals, the extinction of the human race, that's very demonic in our regard. Yeah. I mean it's more indifferent than sort of the way we think about mollusks. Yeah. Yeah, exactly. The other way we think of like, you know, mosquitoes mosquitoes with my favorite because vegans are slap mosquitoes. Oh yeah. I mean I'm get mosquitoes are not like they're alive. Yeah. But are they like, I think clams mollusks on 70 and then insects. I'm like, well, there's some weird arguments about that then mean why not eat crickets? Because cricket protein is excellent. I've had cricket bars before. They're covered in chocolate. They taste really good. They're high protein.

Speaker 2:          02:21:58       Many. I do know many people who do advocate for that. My view is just like if you're unsure then play safe.

Speaker 1:          02:22:05       MMM. And you'd be eating a lot of crickets, like. Yeah. But there's a lot of crickets out there to you. Well, if you're, could them like might be hunting tickets with a tiny little spear. I don't think I. How you do it, you're a lot more brutal than that. I mean, I think factory farming for crickets. It'd be a horrific institution, you know, and you just. What would you do?

Speaker 3:          02:22:26       Just fucking swarms of them. The smash them down to a protein bar. I would, I worry about. Is that, what is the current number of the amount of species that have ever existed that are now extinct? It's fucking huge. 90 nine point nine, nine percent or something? Why not us? Why not us? Oh yeah. And if we do give birth to artificial intelligence, if we are the caterpillar that gives birth to the butterfly that winds up taking over the world some artificial butterfly.

Speaker 2:          02:22:53       Yeah, I mean, I think the thing that worries me is that, you know, it's ai is it's kind of its own thing. Um, and I think, you know, we do because it's like potentially extremely beneficial as well. And if it goes, even if supposing it goes well, then it's a huge thing like we should care about it whether or not we're worried about the extinction risk because it's one of the things, one of the later cases I think where we can really see into the future and think, yes, this is going to be a transformative technology. We don't know when it's gonna happen, but when it does, when it does, it's going to be tons formative and it's going to be very powerful. And that means we should have some kind of careful thought about it. But it seems to me there's a variety of ways that the human race could kill itself. Now. So novel pathogens being one example, large Hadron collider. So my colleague toby actually wrote a paper on the large Hadron collider because there was always, you know, talking about, oh we could hold and so on. And so he either an academic paper where he just talked about the risk analysis that they did. And they said, oh, the chance of the large Hadron collider creating a black hole or something else. It was like really dangerous. Is Ten to the power of negative 60 feet.

Speaker 3:          02:24:10       You know what, that's not going zero. It's not zero. Firstly, it's not zero was motherfuckers that could addiction. What if we put the odds were really long. We didn't know.

Speaker 2:          02:24:20       But the second thing also is that, um, it's a, you shouldn't think that anything's tend to the negative 60 feet, Bailey, unless you have very, very strong models behind, right? Because what's the chance that you just made some mistake in your calculation? It's like, you know, maybe it's as low as one in a million that mistake completely swamped. And so that was the point he was making just statistical point saying, look, I'm not commenting on whether this is dangerous or not, it's just that you've made a mistake in your methodology, um, with respect to your risk assessment. And so it was really funny because then he was there. This is fairly calm, sensible, um, you know, a philosopher from Oxford in a meeting with lunch either and Kaleida surrounded by all the, um, you know, uh, elementum like tin foil, tin foil, hat people, aluminum file minium. I love the way you guys say aluminum right now. Apparently I'm. I was so annoyed when I found this. But penalty. Your, your way is correct and it's just a weird area tire with an I really. And

Speaker 1:          02:25:24       then you start saying things like click. Oh, there's a nice click of people in the niche and the fire. Oh, you say it's a niche for for. Yeah, for. Yeah, for. Yeah. We say for here though, do people say four year? So I've definitely heard for you. Walmart people was a white trash. Where are you from originally? Where am I from? New Jersey is where I was born because I thought it was a New York thing, but maybe, maybe not. Maybe I didn't really grow up there. Grew up all over the place. Boston mostly. Yeah. But you know, you do. You do so many things long. It's very, it's very distressing to me. I'll tell you what we don't do. We don't do Queens. You guys still have queens? I love the Queen Shit. She's still going. It's so funny. I feel like every time I go, no. I think the queen is like hilarious institution.

Speaker 1:          02:26:15       That's his job always to like wave and this wave she just kind of rocks her hand back and forth. Some sort of weird semi vulcan stance. Um, it's Kinda funny. Yeah. Talking to especially some of the kind of pick last of friends I have in a medical, like you've got a monarchy, everyone talking about it. If you guys like it's quaint. Yeah. We're just like no one really thinks about her. Right. But she still lives in a fucking castle and the castle, she lives off the dime. But if you do an economic analysis, she brings in more money than she, um, sort of. But she takes a lot. She's sort of the anti will macaskill if you asked me. Yeah, that's, I mean the test is they support and she just gets all this free money and that bitch just wears gold and shit and drives around in a limo.

Speaker 1:          02:27:00       It's kind of ridiculous. So you could, yeah, you could definitely, uh, get the same tour. Doesn't benefit people are mad. I say, bitch, I'm not really meaning the word bitch, so I could all due respect folks. Just a figure of speech, a humorous figure speech. Okay. Well I appreciate the. Yeah. I don't want to disparage your ruler. The cliche, the caveat. Such a strange rule though. Kings and Queens and Prince Charles. It's really funny. Pov that sculpture. So I keep. It's so funny because I keep. I spent a lot of time in California, but every time I come back it seems to be on some major event to do with ilt. So one was the queen's birthday, one was the event of the Queens being the longest ever running monarch. When was the jubilee. We don't know about that at all. Those things for you is these massive events. It just means I come off the plane being in America for a while and then it's just pictures of the queen. Everyone say okay. Yeah, I'm definitely back in play tea now. Now what's going on now? And I think crazy. What's happening now. Yeah, huge news today. What? Um, well for me as a skunk, I'm Nicholas Sturgeon, the first minister of Scotland. A kind of think of Scotland to the UK is state to federal level, but it's a little bit different. Um, announced there's gonna be a second. She's planning second Scottish referendum.

Speaker 2:          02:28:23       So because the, because Britain is taking yourself out of the European Union where they expect is that announcing can meet Tuesday end of month, but it's very shortly. I'm, Scotland did not want to leave. The EU voted overwhelmingly in favor of remaining. So Scotland in general, it tends to lean a lot further left than the rest of the UK. Um, and previously had an independence referendum. It was very close, actually 52 percent, um, within favor of staying apart for the union. So the state of the Union, um, there's now going to be a second referendum. These, this is what Nicola Sturgeon is saying. Um, and because of the Brexit vote, I think it's much more likely that Scotland will say, yes, we're going to leave. And then they have the main part of the European Union where there's the last of Litton, um, will leave. And it's interesting for me because I was very kind of play with the union against independence in the previous, um, referendum now I'm not sure now, I think I probably am in it because I think that brexit was just such bad decision, um, that I kind of want them to be punished for that.

Speaker 2:          02:29:37       And well, I think there's two things. One is the, um, I think that now the case for Scotland being part of the EU but not part of Britain, the economic case can, it makes a bit more sense now than it did in the past. But then secondly, just I would kind of worry that um, Britain leaves the EU, EU, does that trigger kind of spark like, you know, a much larger movement where the just the EU as a project kind of breaks down. Um, and if it's the case like, well, UK leaves the EU, but as a result the country just falls apart.

Speaker 3:          02:30:12       I think that you wanted that to happen. You wanted England to fall apart, to be punished for leaving the

Speaker 2:          02:30:18       be like a very major signal. Like I don't think it would be. What if they prospered? They were, oh yeah. I mean then if it is, if I do got. If I was convinced that the blacks, that was the late decision that was actually best for the world and then I would change my mind.

Speaker 3:          02:30:34       I don't know enough about it, but I do have a friend who's very knowledgeable and he's from England and he. His take on it was the real issue with the EU is that you're dealing with a bunch of people that aren't even elected. They're just sort of running the European Union and he's like, and we don't have to tell you when you just look at history, what happens when people have a great amount of power and aren't even elected to their position and you're allowed to just go to any part of the European Union and move into it. He's like, that was very detrimental and very bad in terms of the way England's financial structure was set up. They were like, this could. This would be detrimental to England, but beneficial to other places and the idea was that we were supposed to accept the fact that it'd be detrimental to England and beneficial to other countries and many people in England did not want to do that. And in doing and in making that decision, they were thought to be Zena phobic. They were thought to be a nationalistic and that it was racist.

Speaker 2:          02:31:35       So I think there's, um, yeah, two things. I mean, one thing is yeah, I don't like, um, yeah, I mean, so there's kind of two things. One where the specter of their sovereignty question, um, I mean like European Union, like it has its own parliament and so on. You can vote on that. You each get number of electors and the reason in so far as it's undemocratic, it's mainly just because people don't care like the don't care democratic, but t as in voter, so turnout to have elections for members of European Parliament. The turnout is very low. I think it's like 30 percent sort of thing. Maybe it will be larger now they realize the consequences of it. Well, I mean, there's not going to be anymore because it's gonna, it's gonna leave implode. Well, Benton's leaving Britain's leaving, so you no longer voting for members of parliament.

Speaker 2:          02:32:21       Um, so that's one question and then like is this good or bad split? And um, I think like the economic case is just incredibly swung for European kind of good for the reason being just like fleet fade in general benefits both parties. You want to really maximize the amount of fleet late. Um, but then the bigger thing for me, it's just like with respect to unity between countries is like the tail risk risk of war, which we don't really think about because we haven't had a like a world war since, um, you know, the early, mid 20th century, um, but Europe had had like a long period of comparative peacefulness like before the first world war. People thought, no, it's unthinkable given the level of interconnectedness between the countries that are World War can play count and intuited. Right. Um, and so, and I think those sorts of things would be, you know, the tail outcome, it can be very bad indeed. Um, and we don't often think about it because it's just this occasional thing and so that's why in general and just always more like not all, almost always more pillow. I'm closer relations between, um, between companies

Speaker 3:          02:33:34       that makes sense to me. Um, what he said makes sense to me as well though when he was saying essentially it was like think of the United States, but now think of each state being country. You're allowed to elect a leader of that country, but you can't elect a leader for the United States. And so that's essentially how he was looking at the European Union. He was saying the European Union is, they're not elected and yet there are controlling all these other elected officials and elected state's all group together instead of thinking of them as like Germany and England, think of them as states and think of the European Union and the officials. The people that are in control of the European Union aren't even elected.

Speaker 2:          02:34:13       Yeah. So I mean, you do elect the parliament and then it's also the case,

Speaker 1:          02:34:18       the analogy, like the amount of power that Europe has over the remaining the other countries. It's like nothing like the amount of power of the federal government, the federal government has overstates like um, you know, the UK sets. So the power is the EU has one of the things that are got made lots of attention was bendy, bananas. This guy like a real focus area for people's either also and what does that mean? So according to EU regulations, so EU has a single market, so that means you have just the same standards across all countries, but then that means you just start to say have the standards of the things like bananas. And so there was one EU regulation which was that a banana couldn't be too bendy, otherwise it would count as a defective banana. And so people were like up and age about this.

Speaker 1:          02:35:11       Like how can the EU dictate to us, um, the shape of our bananas. But I think the case is like a good one. It's like, it's really not that important. It's just a banana. Why are they even going to regulate it then? Well, it's because if you want to have like a fee, like single market, you need to have common standards across. Um, and then this was just marketing standards were like the Bendy, bananas don't sell and then the straighter ones do. Yeah, I mean, I don't know more of the detail about that seems to be the time the government steps in on something as fucking ridiculous as the bend in the shape of a banana and be like, hey, fuck face. Why don't you go take care of poverty? You know, why don't you, why don't you handle something real instead of dealing with bendy bananas.

Speaker 1:          02:35:53       Look. So on the Bendy Madonna's case. Yeah. I can't off the top of my head. Think of why you'd want to not allow the sale. But that's what people worry about when they worried about bureaucracy when you worried about too much control. Yeah. So, um, that's a great example. In fact, why, why people don't want micromanaging of our culture. Yeah. But then the question is do we want to leave over bananas? And I think a lot of other factors, it's not the bananas that caused it, right. But the thing is the UK as part of the European Union has sovereignty over like what's income taxes, all of its laws as long as they don't conflict with the UN Declaration of human rights, which was first invented by the UK, has control of a, um, yeah, all of it's internal, um, legislation, it completely can go to war if, once I'm undetected. So the loss of sovereignty seems pretty mild from my perspective.

Speaker 1:          02:36:47       And I feel like I feel like they focus on these examples, which is like, okay, maybe like let's say yeah, it's okay. It's a cost we would like to be able to like maybe it'd be better if it could make decision of men as maybe the bananas was the bad coal. Well, it definitely doesn't seem like a universal reaction. I mean the, the, there's a large percentage of the people in England are very upset about brexit. No, it's a really interesting sort of a divide between people. I mean, the thing that I find fascinating is that we would make, and I think this in general, I think this the elections as well because I studied a bunch of voting theory wanting my phd and we make these momentous decisions as a country where we get everyone in the population. That's fine. Go to a specific place and then get the smallest possible information out of them that you can, which is just a single tick like yes or no.

Speaker 1:          02:37:42       Whereas there's so much more you could be doing. So in one case with a referendum, um, rather than just at a particular date where the turnout is affected by things like the weather, um, it's affected by, you know, what happened in the week before and instead you just have figured referenda and given them a mountainous momentousness of the decision, spending more money on, like actually getting the accurate views of the people, um, is super important. So instead, yeah, you have free over the period of six months and choose the best, um, you know, be best fee basically where there's, that would be like a more accurate, an accurate representation of what people think of a time. Sure. But isn't there also a gigantic issue with people not being informed about what they're voting on? You don't have to be informed about what you're voting on. You certainly don't have to be accurate about what you, you could easily be misled and the actual hard, provable facts could be completely outside of your grasp and yet you still make a big decision.

Speaker 1:          02:38:40       I wondered before about having a um, attest attest. Yeah, you go like, but like really, really basic. Um, I think it would still. There's this question of just why do we care about democracy? What's the point? Why do we seems like a really important thing? Oh yeah. Political philosophers talk about this all the time. So they kind of agreed like democracy seems goods, other forms of government that we know so far seem terrible, terrible, or worse. But why? Why is democracy good? Is it just that democracy gives us this way to boot out dictators and the risk of a single person taking power is just really, really bad and so we just need some mechanism to get rid of that. Is that it's intrinsically valuable? Is it that people just have a right to have equal representation and that's just this fundamental thing? Or is it justified on just in terms of the consequences?

Speaker 1:          02:39:38       Is it because if everybody's able to contribute then people will make better decisions? I never necessarily think it's an either or. I think there's also the people like to feel like they play a part, like they don't want to feel like they're being ruled over by some monarch. They want to feel like they have some sort of a play and the decision making. It's also what one of the gross things about trump winning in this country is how many people gloated you know, how many people gloat upon victory that their side one and then you're dealing with this whole team mentality that people adopt when it comes to any sort of an issue. Well, I mean this is cool, right? Right. Yeah, no, in general, this is one of the things I'm really worried

Speaker 2:          02:40:14       about with, um, uh, um, is increasing levels of partisanship. This is just this really robust phenomenon that we're seeing. Um, and it's really worrying because it means that we're just undermining any chance of people changing their mind. Like someone, like people say, well, it costs a commie accepted, but like the vast majority of votes were. And similarly for Hillary's votes were from people who just always voted Republican or Democrat. Well, not necessarily

Speaker 3:          02:40:40       because the trump won by so many votes that have good percentage of them had to have voted for Obama. Just statistically,

Speaker 2:          02:40:48       oh, I'm, I'm still thinking of thumps votes. What proportion of people have only ever voted Republican? It's a good question. And I would like definitely bet greater than 80 percent negative. Ninety percent. Yeah, that's what I mean. If you look at the polls, like it's always that in terms of expected number of votes, like, oh, it's only 46 percent in favor trump with his office.

Speaker 3:          02:41:13       So the issue that the independence and the swing states, whether it's Gary Johnson or whether it's Jill Stein, those independence, the amount of votes they got would have swung the other way towards Hillary. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          02:41:25       I remember looking into this for Jill Stein in particular, and actually it was the case she would have won the popular vote by even more, but in none of the swing states, did she get enough of a percentage,

Speaker 3:          02:41:36       not just Jill Stein or Gary Johnson as well?

Speaker 2:          02:41:38       Yeah, though Gary Johnson, it seemed to me was split almost evenly between trump and hillary. But this is an interesting case. So the thing that people. Yeah, I don't think about so much as like, I think the process, we all the sudden like a democracy, but like one single, I'm like check box every four years. It's like the smallest amount of information you can be getting and it's susceptible to all sorts of different things. So it's opposing. And this happens on both sides. It's opposing. Jill Stein became, you know, really, um, a really popular, took 10 percent of the vote. She would've just killed hillary like absolutely or suppose. And the Evan Mcmullin, is that his name? Yeah, he was a Publican Independent. Okay. Did well in Utah and it was supposedly a far right candidate. It does really well. Again, takes all of the votes away from, from um, the fact that that's possible. Shows that like first past the post voting system is a very bad voting system, is not accurately representing the will of the people and we could do so much better than it would mean that I'm like as a democratic process, you'd be much closer to that. Presenting what people actually believe or feel about things because right now it means that yeah, you can be influenced by stuff. Like how much support as a third party get. Well

Speaker 3:          02:43:00       System's terrible system. It lasts too long. The decisions last for four years. This person gets locked into position unless you impeach them and then remove them from office. They're stuck. It sucks. I wish I could talk about more, but I can't. I gotta

Speaker 1:          02:43:12       get the Fuck Outta here. But uh, this, that's the least interesting thing we talked about today. But the ai and all the other stuff is just fascinating stuff. If people want to know more about your, uh, effective altruism movement and more about you, where should they go? They should go to effective altruism.org. Um, that's got tons of information about effective altruism if you want to, if there's one takeaway that you literally want to do, you think, wow, actually this was kind of cool. I do want to make more of a difference. We've just launched a set of funds so it just means you can donate within one of these, cause that is a global development, animal welfare or preservation of the long run future against global catastrophic risks. You can just donate and have ensure that we'll go to the vet. He most effective nonprofits, zero percent overheads depending how you tonight. And I'm like, we don't take any money along the way and just means that, yeah, super easy to donate as effectively as possible. All right, beautiful. Thank you. Well appreciate. It was really fun. We'll be back tomorrow with Jim Norton Seal.

Speaker 5:          02:44:12       Yeah.
