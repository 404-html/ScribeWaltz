Speaker 1:          00:00:00       They give it to him? No, no. Half light cotton. The best jeans I've ever worn. I don't get paid for him. The guy just said, we live who live ladies and mother fucking gentlemen. This is a fight companion podcast. What that means is we're watching the fights. This was supposed to be the heavyweight title fight and I was supposed to be in Vegas. It's supposed to be for BC over doom versus Cain Velasquez. But Cain Velasquez got hurt. Uh, and he pulled out of the fight and then steep meo chick replaced him. And then [inaudible] said, well I'm hurt too. Fuck this. And he pulled out, cause I guess he had a couple of injuries. Smart move. I guess if you're injured, you know, he figured, fuck it. I'm just going to fight cane no matter what I guess. And then when, um, when he found out I was Mijo chickies like, listen, I'm hurt. Fuck this smart move. Yeah, because usually you do it. This is before we go ahead and have it, this, this is a fight companion podcast is not a regular podcast. So we're watching the fights. But honestly, it's almost never us watching the fights. So if you listen to this right now, you're like, I don't give a fuck about fights. Most of the time we don't either.

Speaker 1:          00:01:05       Any Bravo's here? My brother Eddie Bravo, the greatest endeavor did it. What? Holla. Brian Cowen, my dog, one of my favorite human beings on the planet as well as my brother Brendan Shop. Also one of my favorite humans on the planet. So these are my favorite podcast more than anything. I look forward to these fucking things the best. There's so much fun. The best. It's like we get to hang out and be ourselves. We get to fuck around. Just talk level dude's Oh, just talking shit. We get tell bro out. We just throw out for three hours, go out on a Pearl authentically, have some fun, watch some fights. Talk about what we, Brian is going to try on this barbell jeans. I got him some flexi jeans. It's kids funny how guys don't change my son. I went hiking with him and all he was talking about for two days is I want you to teach me how to chop down a tree.

Speaker 1:          00:01:56       He's obsessed. I'm like, all right, it was, but I need to chop a tree down and constantly go and we call it quote unquote tropic tree none. And I get him a hatchet. He hasn't put that hatchet down. You give that kid any kind of a weapon. My daughter looks at the hatchet like, what is going to, maybe I can decorate it. She wanted to know. She wanted to put sparkles on the handle. And my son was like, why? You know what's interesting? You say gay men can go one of two ways. They can go towards like girly type stuff or they can go just as manly. We talked about how to be assigned, talking about the beers. Well there's just not even know. It's like two different styles of gay men. Like I've a gay couple that lives on my street stud. Nicest fucking dudes.

Speaker 1:          00:02:35       There's so nice. And one of them is the man. Yes, he's into trucks. Yup. And, and, and it makes all the cash. You can break it down to one, one to be talked trucks. You can break it down. One Guy, one fox guys and the other doesn't, well I don't know. I don't know how that works. I don't get personal with them. They're just the coolest motherfucker. It'd be the best neighbors. I know. Come to wipe that and I get personal with them. But then there's, then there's like the twinks who are there. They're super girly. Then why would you want to just be with a girl? You know what I'm saying? Or like the lesbians. Well how come some dude's like girls? A big acid. Some, some girls, dude's like girls are really skinny. Everyone likes a girl with a big band. Like there's some guys that are into like really skinny girls, like really skinny model type girls with no acid.

Speaker 1:          00:03:24       I none of my friends, it's all over the map that it's a good way to put it. It's all over the map. He said the truck tried to talk fucking suspension shit. My heart, John, see you later. He goes, sucks days. Husband is actually in the trucks too, so it's weird. But the point being is like, they're very different personalities that are gay. Like I know gay dudes that don't seem even a little gay. And then, you know, they had eventually come out and it, you know, explain the whole thing like a, do you know why? Like this is like the fuck's his name. Like, let me think of like a good example what this just so there's a lot of, there's a lot to name him. My Buddy, my buddy Keith is, is, he's the man in the relationship and he wrestled a, you know, and, and college made millet makes millions of dollars and he was with a bunch of straight guys were all eating and stuff hanging out that frank was there.

Speaker 1:          00:04:16       And he goes, um, he just said it. So matter of fact that he goes, man, I think the only difference between me and you guys is I suck cock. You know, it's got a really deep voice differences. I'm not going to get fucked, you know, but I mean, I fuck him. You know, that's Hilarious Guy, right? Some will only fund my buddy Keith is that way. Some will only fuck some of them. Don't give blowjobs write up. Some don't get blowjobs only give blowjobs gay singles sites. I bet they have to say that at that bit. There's a name for that, like a duty doesn't Suck Dick. He's got to have a name. There's gotta be like a code while he's a think of a name. I had the weirdest conversation with a gay couple wants after a show I did in Connecticut way back in the day.

Speaker 1:          00:05:00       Man, I don't even remember what bid it was. They were upset about, but they came up to me after the show and they were saying that they just, just to let you know, most gay guys don't fuck each other in the ass. Like we're married, we're gay or there are a cop. I don't know if they were, it was legal to be married back then because you're talking about like 91 92 something like that. Yeah, and he was talking about we just blow each other when I was like, okay, I know where to go with this. Was talking to me about after a while I would, I been, I said, I would've said, I don't believe you, but no, no, no. He was, he was being honest. He was like, we're not into it. And he's like, it seems like the kind of humor like that kind of gay humor like fucking the ass humor is like, it goes over really big out here in Connecticut. Like, but we mostly we hang out in the city. Like he was one of those guys. It was like big on telling you that. I'm, I'm very sophisticated. I'm always in the city and I don't even take it in the ass. I'm just getting my dick sucked by guys. This trained just fucking conversation that guys like that, that,

Speaker 2:          00:05:58       uh, I went to him was, it was like, but you know, guys do get fucked in the ass. Yeah. What I'm talking about someone fucking some of the ass. It's not like I'm making things up now. No, I was under the impression that they all did that. They don't, they definitely don't. They definitely don't option though, right? Yeah. The first time, I don't know. I don't at least on their birthday every now and then on the birthday, boom, you got to give up. You know what I mean? I'm having him do a survey once in a while. A complaint. I bet that's the number one complaint. That's why they, they break up when that, when they stop fucking in the ass and it's just hand jobs that you know it's over. Yeah. Fuck out. Get the fuck out. This is the kind of fight shot Mike piles about the fights.

Speaker 2:          00:06:39       Sean's man. How's the kind of fight that makes me wish that TRT was legal cause pile so fucking smart and exactly. He's so fucking smart and crafty. I wish they could get that dude on TRT. You know what I'm saying? 100% needs it. Well of course you definitely need it when you hit for so long. 40 and think how long he's been fighting. He's been fighting for a long time and he's taken some, some hard shots. He's been Kod by guys like Matt Brown. Tough. He's been killed by Roy McDonald. A few other guys too. He's a tough fucking smart dude though. He's his skill levels very high, but you know there's a reality. This is a goddamn difference between a 21 year old body, a natural one and a natural 40 year old body. They're just his, his fight Iq is half the very highest, very high.

Speaker 2:          00:07:26       He's a savage man. About 10 years ago we did a movie together were extras and it will be called a the assassination of a high school principal. We play like I'm 35 years old and I'm playing a fraternity guy and it was terrible. It was terrible. So, but we're both in it and I, that guy is such a savage, I've never seen anybody. We went to a club that night. Afterwards he went into a club, grab a girl like a savage, just Tucker grabbed that bitch by the opponent down. We went back to the hotel and he handled business. I never seen, damn, we don't know what his status was that we don't know what happened between 10 and 20 years ago. He could have been a hundred years ago. Mike Pyle is, one thing I remember about Mike is he is a savage. I've never seen anybody get down like let's be real careful with those kinds of details.

Speaker 2:          00:08:17       Those can be brought up. Yeah, that's true. That's assault brother. He can't be doing that. Well he's uh, yeah. You can't say you do that anymore. It used to be that that was like an old movie trick. Do you know who's the biggest savage as far as getting chicks I've ever seen and you would never guess want to give you a hundred tries. Me and him were in Toronto. Give you a hundred tries. Jake shields, so I would imagine just Asian. So he's a handsome Asian girls. He's doing something you thought he's Tom Cruise up in that bitch. They scheels a very handsome guy. I mean he's cool, but he was like, Hey, I need you to be my wing man and help me out here. I was like, what do you mean be? Say it's cool. Like you don't think that's a good looking guys, not Luke Rockhold Oh, come

Speaker 1:          00:08:56       on. I wouldn't say, is that handsome there? I said, oh, he's not as hands on with Luke. Rockhold is ridiculous. The time piece. He's a straight coupon level, that's for sure. And your bonds a straight model. He's alive and he's talking about, those guys will tell you know the story about Alan's Siobhan had a big photo shoot in New York City like two weeks before his fight, so he had a cut weight twice. She cuts wait for his photo shoots. He gets shredded for his photo shoots. I talked to Kenny Johnson about his wrestling coach. Is Versace, right? Yeah. He's got a big fucking campaign man. He's going to make bank Dan. He's a beautiful person and not just the way he looks the most like it's a great guy, great guy. His heart. He's the sweetest guy and a young don fry. He's such a nice guy, like to train with and everything too. He's so polite. He's just a great guy. Like Alan Jaeger. Bands are salt of the earth. I agree. But anyway, it doesn't get any better looking bitch.

Speaker 1:          00:09:50       Jake shields is a mate that's strong. Yeah, he's a strong strong. Can you help me out here? I say, Oh, come on. Come on, take yourself. I'll give you a hit of weed out sambo five I'm now fears don't hell critical to help. He's a nine girls like fucked up years. Curls like the giant, like a guy who's been through some danger. They don't like a guy who was terrified of danger. It's a natural instinctive reaction. It's to protect your genetics. A guy who has never experienced danger may very well fall apart in the face of danger. So a guy who does crazy shit like does flips in bikes. Why do you think they do that? They do that because it attracts females because females are attracted to a guy who's very risky. The guy who takes chances and does nutty shit because those guys can survive pressure.

Speaker 1:          00:10:46       That makes sense. I'm just saying with all the UFC fighters, I'd give myself a five because we're all, you know, we're all [inaudible] be a solid eight. Yeah, about that. [inaudible] saw an eight maybe eight and a half, but you're better. You're, you're a notch better than Jake shields. Cause you're way bigger than them. Like I see girls look at you. It's hilarious. It's, I'm looking at in their little ovaries go hungry eyes. Oh Shit. Every parents, everything we've done, not just fighter and the kid fence. My, a friend of mine, he's never even met shop before. It was like, who is your friend? If you could tell her a little loins were tender at the comedy store, a bartender comments are accountable now till fucking bro. That's awesome. Oh my gosh. See I was already talking about her. I'm just saying general mother fucker, the waitress at the, uh, the waiters [inaudible] one of the waitresses at the cottonwood. How about nothing? I would say, what's a 10 Jovan? He's up there. Saatchi not lesson. Well, you're being kind of chops and a good looking at, he's got personality. Personality means more than two points. It does an eight. Look at that. Alan Japan. Lord, that's not even a real person. Tell me he should at least tell me. It's five [inaudible] eight tall, six feet. He just did the campaign for an equinox.

Speaker 1:          00:12:06       Alan Joe Ban Hater. You fucking hate people because he's one of the best people I've ever met. I agree. Just a great, great dude. It's fucking great guy. Can't say anything bad about them. If I look like that, I'd wake up every morning and be like, this going to be a good day. I'm telling you though. I mean he's not a pretty boy. I mean this mother fuckers and scrap some serious fights and he bites down on that mouthpiece. Very good fighter. He fought to men off man to man off is a mother fucker dude motherfucker. I just liked that match up. His efficiency and his stroke is a tough fight for anybody. Especially tough fight when you start. He cut week two weeks but no, he got knocked out in the first round. No, no, no. I'm saying not the result. I'm saying on paper. That's a tough fight to pick.

Speaker 1:          00:12:45       I wouldn't have taken it and if I, if I was in there, if I'm Joe man and I just [inaudible] I wouldn't have taken it. I wouldn't have taken it because I don't think, it's not that. I don't think he could beat that guy. I just think right now men off striking is so smooth and efficient and heavy and down the pipe string. It's also very fluid. Like he can go from throwing a jab to throw in a lead up or cut in a straight right hand and every one of them is perfect and they count, they count, they're accurate and the mechanics behind them are totally Crary. Dude. Like there's guys that probably hit harder. Like Tyron Woodley probably hits harder than anybody. Tyron Woodley like one shot for one shot. Like when when he KLJ heroin, I was like, Jesus Christ, he doesn't explode. Exploder dude, if he catches you perfectly on that explosion, he's going to put you away.

Speaker 1:          00:13:37       And it's not saying that like his efficiency is bad cause efficiencies way better even now because he's training with Duke Roufus but to Nofx doesn't have that one shot power that Woodley has, but his efficiency is perfect. Everything is perfect. You see a guy that hits hard, one of the things you see almost invariably is there. Their body positioning is always perfect. Like when when a guy's throwing like a ridiculous punch, you'll see the bend in the legs, you'll see the term body. You know when a guy's like a serious power Stryker with two Manav, everything's in place. It's all like the knees in the right spot. When the hook, when he's throwing the hook, his foot's in the right spots, waits in the right spot. There's no like, no bullshit. Then he'd come out of the Russian amateur boxing his thing. He's a master of sports and boxing.

Speaker 1:          00:14:24       They keep fucking kicked too, man. He can Kish there was amazing. Here's a program. Yeah, it's, he's unexpectedly dangerous with his kicks, but he lost his last fight. I didn't know. No, he beat a lark and that's right. But it wasn't a great course. It wasn't a great fight. I love that fight really so close because they're so dangerous. We do a fight campaigning for that. I don't think so. This was the one with Lorens. Lark was throwing those wheel kits. That's right. And Feminine Up is fucked up, but to Nauv hung in there to the

Speaker 2:          00:14:52       end and one is super close fight. I honestly thought that Larkin pulled it off, but I wasn't upset at the decisions are so close. It's so weird. Those does low. We'll kicks. He does all kinds of weird, skewed is a bad mother fucker dude. He's one of the dark horses in that division. His take down defense. I'm till I haven't seen anything like in a long time. He came up to rain to train with Munios. Pat comes and myself and his wrestling day. I was like, oh, we're just going to take this full down. Well I don't want to take it up by really large was going to have the Kiki and advantage in two minutes. It's going to have the striking advantage and that's how it turned out. But God damn was a close ass fight. Laura Larkin actually has braces and during the fight is fucking braces were sticking into his mouth.

Speaker 2:          00:15:33       Oh my God. If something went wrong with his braces, he was like trying to fix it in between rounds. Fucking Ufo with brace. He shouldn't be fighting with braces or Invisalign and he's very good looking man. He is the frank shamrock racist and needs him. The silver mouth, I don't know. I don't know. I didn't see it until a, they're talking about an in between rounds. The corner. I still feel bad about myself after seeing has got, I wonder if Bella tours getting let Benson Henderson fight with a toothpick in his mouth. Three of them do whatever the fuck he wants. He's going, Oh shit. Oh, he's covering heads up really bad. Oh, he's come on pile. Don't get too crazy. Oh, it's three Oh one right now. Three two 59 to 58 to 57 St. That shit up a Mike Pyle versus John Spencer. Is that is fighting?

Speaker 2:          00:16:21       Is that the uh, just got stocks. Spencer got rock. Is it? Oh, his name. We shouldn't say that's his name. [inaudible] oh shit. Um, Ben Henderson's fighting for already for the title shot. Right. And he fighting Brooks. Do you know that's like secretly my biggest fear is he going to fight for the title? It's next month. My biggest fear is for getting what someone's name is in the middle of the fight. We'll calling the five cat. Good thing you don't have the headroom. How you doing? Good thing dark. I have Alpha brain and notes. You got enough for preying on you right now. I could use some of that right now. Um, where's the chug? It should be a jug of it. Yeah, there it is. Good fights tonight man. The best stuff is the, the new stuff. We have an instance. The Shit I take for instance, stuff is awesome.

Speaker 2:          00:17:06       I love from happening here too, that Kyle Kingsbury on the other day, he's the best great guy. Oh my God. What a sweetheart. So fucking smart to his wife is a smoke show. 3002 she used to be UFC ring card. Yes. It's very cool chick to like real whole family. Just good people. They're, they're salted. The earth. What'd you call so cool. Salt of the earth dams. I said smoke show. Oh smoke show. Salto their smoke show. Um, mine. Mine's more old school. You're just probably better. Yeah, she's just really sweet person too. It's cool seeing them parents too. It's wild because they have to or no one, one little boy. God, he's so fucking cute. You just start smoking weed like recently, right? And kind of like a, I don't think so. No, no. He does everything. He's big in the IOWASCA.

Speaker 1:          00:17:51       Thomas was like, shit, I was under the impression. Just started. What do you mean like, or maybe it's the week before he did a bunch of uh, Wasco and then flop pat. Oh yeah. Molly walked by Pat I had is a mother corner pattern that fight pat Cummings is a motherfucker. Look how smart Mike Pilot. It's like Oh, efficient and smooth, you know, sees the shots he slips him like, and he's in real good shape. I mean don't get me wrong, but that's just a reality about what a 40 year old body can do as far as the way he pushes himself. Like that was what recovery and stuff are Nard Hopkins back. You know, like Bernard Hopkins just couldn't keep a pace with a guy like surrogate Kovalev off. Like he had to go and do like a defensive mode against him. It was tough to watch, but it was because he was 49 years old.

Speaker 1:          00:18:36       If he fought Kovalev when he was 35 Holy Shit. That would have been an amazing fight. Fight, amaze. You see Cole of less white dude. What the fuck? He's a murderer. Him and at him and Andre Ward. That's the fight. He killed the guy in the ring. Yeah, he did. And it didn't kill the guy. Yeah. It didn't affect him the way it affects most people. It's very interesting. I get it hurted Russia. Yeah. It didn't take anything off of his desire to compete does not give a fuck. He, that's a, that's one thing that happens to fight or sometimes and man, they're, they're rarely the same after someone dies. Zany. That happened. He was never really the smell Griffith. They say that, that uh, you know, Emil Griffith's they say was gay and that Benny Perez, the guy who was fighting was talking to a lot of shit about him being gay and was saying a lot of like gay slurs and Ameel Griffith beat the fuck out of that dude.

Speaker 1:          00:19:24       I mean, he died, he died him to death. They beat him to death. Yeah. I don't remember what round was. If I went, if I had a guest, I want to say it was like the 14th round, there's a documentary on boom, boom. Saying how when that guy died, he was never the same. Oh yeah, of course. He didn't want to find fighters and by I think the guy's name is bond key moon or something like that. Cool. Kim Duck who came, that's what I was packing. My boy you were close by king man is he works as the is I think it's the correct number, the UN or something. Um, he was, um, his dad was his, uh, his dad was his coach. Boom. I know. Uh Oh Jesus Christ. Summer man. Well that was another extreme. Dehydration fight. Extremely dehydrated. You get down to one 35. [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          00:20:07       shit was on national TV. He also had weigh ins the day of the fights. It's a terrible idea. They did. Somebody did something I read and I don't know if it's true, but they said that pretty sure I remember a number of people who've died in the ring had dad's for their coach, you know, don't push themselves. They're not a lot. But apparently that's, it's very common for guys to push themselves to, they get really hurt because their dad's in the corner. Well, Wonderboy Thompson is trained by his dad, isn't he? Yeah, yeah, that's right. And so sage, sage, Northcutts Dad, um, he's been Darren Cruickshank trained by his dad. You think sage is, uh, all the, all the flak he's getting on the Internet is just, what do you think about that? No, listen, I think like if you ask any fighter, hey, if Dane off do you 1440 going to take it at 19.

Speaker 1:          00:20:55       Fuck yes. It's not his fault. This whole hype machine. Well you know what man, it's uh, it was a good fight for him to experience, to learn. That's all he needs to learn some, you know, some ground defense and he needs to learn some Jujitsu, but that's to be expected. He's only fucking 19 years old Jim. All the top guys that are good at you get, I get caught. I think it was the best thing to happen to. Sky's the limit though as far as he's essential at 19 years of agency to have a very good attitude. He's a smart kid at like athletically. He's ridiculous. Fucking, if you see those flush front flips, it's crazy. Off One off the toe off one toe on the way he does it. It looks like it looks fake. It looks like he's on a stick. You're spinning.

Speaker 1:          00:21:33       I'm like one of those uh, foosball tables. Yeah. He said he was on antibiotics too in that fight cause he looked like shit. I mean we had strep. It was one of the reasons why apparently he tapped so quickly cause like when it was clamping on his throat, he was already swollen. His throat was already fucked up. He had strep. He's going to be fine. He gets a lot of, hey, it's a lot of head. Of course it's tough. Like, uh, like you see Tony Ferguson made a video videos like I tapped out like a bitch. It's tough if you're a guy like Tony Ferguson who's grinding, right, he doesn't get nowhere near as much love. Well like sage, you know, Tony Ferguson is in the PR business as well as in the fight business. That's the reality and the post McGregor error. You're in the PR business, man.

Speaker 1:          00:22:11       Look what Conor Mcgregor did. He's a, Ooh, my pile. Got a good gay teens. Got An Amo scooting in here. Look at, I'm scooting in here. Watch that. Right Butterfly. He will mount. He will fucking, aw, you missed it. Missed the mount. It was smart. Bloody wrapping it all. Yeah. He's a bad motherfucker. Mike Pyle, he fought rampage Jackson like in 2013 pro fights. It was his first pro fight was rampage Jackson in Tennessee. Rampage is way bigger than he is. Yup. Yup. I'm telling you Mike Pyle and that was one of the reasons that Matt Brown was like so respectful about him after the fight. He's like, people don't know how good Mike Pyle is. I guess in the training room too. He's even better. I guess he's up mother fucker right here. They say in the train room, he's like unstoppable telling the TRT is designed for dudes like this can't do it anymore and now they have fun.

Speaker 1:          00:23:02       They have testing rates. Yes. Yes. They have a testing HGH that gets you from 21 days out. Why tell you're really fun. It used to be like a day. How do they to be like 24 I do shit anymore. Can't do shit. Gene doping be, well, I told you Novitsky said that they've already at least theoretically have testosterone that's derived from animals instead of wild yams. So the carbon isotope tests hasn't work. Yeah, it looks like human testosterone. Wow. Dirty bird shit. Your names the dirty bird. Yeah, but it does of course Mike Pyle, Shawn Spencer throwing down man, props to Spencer for surviving that. That exchange just fights in Vegas. Yeah. This is at the

Speaker 2:          00:23:46       [inaudible] stadium. Looks empty. It's empty. But I'm sure when the main event dropped out, I'm sure a lot of people canceled their trips, do it. I'm not mad at for doom. I was gonna tell you about at the beginning. Yeah, it makes sense because since he's the heavyweight champ, the way it works out a lot of times is you get a percentage of paper views, but you have to hit a certain number. Right. It's hard to market steep a verse for Doom on two weeks. Yeah. He's not going to hit those papers. You numbers. So when he was like, oh, I'm out. I was like, that's fucking brilliant. But he's definitely hurt. I'm the word that I'm hearing from everybody said he's fucking hurt and he's out. He's been having some back problems for a while now. Apparently he was having it on one side of his back and uh, it would lock up, but he was working through it and he, Oh shit.

Speaker 2:          00:24:25       Oh Shit. He got some shit. Ow. Ow. Ow. Stop it. Oh. Oh Man. John Spencer's, who's the RAF is that you stop loving son. That's a brutal pile. Just looked at him. Stop it. [inaudible] he's not defending himself. Eve Levine let shit who Talla is, but you keep that was, that was not good. I agree. But you don't, if you've got eve Levina as your rep, you're like, oh, I'm about to get you fucked up. It's a violent sport. It is about to happen. Yeah, but we can prevent bad. He doesn't know what five of those shots and some of that pressure, dude, four or five of those shots, he's been a ref for fucking the pressures. If he would have stopped it early and everyone found no, no, no. What he gave a fuck. That guy was out. I guys in trouble rather have it go a little late then we'll know that hurts the sport.

Speaker 2:          00:25:19       My man, that's, that's a hurdle. Fucking sport. I disagree. How is that hurting the sport? Are you getting paid little violence? Yeah, but a little late is unnecessary. That wasn't that late man. That was a very entertaining, I might be one last fight on [inaudible] is what we pay for theirs. You know what? It's real subjective Eddie cause you're right in a lot of ways. But then again like there's guys that survive it like Frankie Edgar, right? If you stopped every fight with Frankie, Edgar was wobbled, you'd be in jail. I mean he would never be gray Maynard and that second fight by Kao Cause he got hurt hard in that first round and a lot of trigger happy would, would've pulled the trigger on that fight. And there's a shitload of fights like that. There was a whole list of them. But this one, this one is prolonged would, this is my problem with this.

Speaker 2:          00:25:59       He's not hitting back and he's not defending him. How's he going to win? He's not doing anything. He's just taking shots. He's not [inaudible], but those last shots, he's not moving. He's not moving at all. He's just surviving on its [inaudible]. Celebrity Rehab was definitive call. It wasn't on the fence. It's not because a little over the fence. That's why there's subjective thinking, dude, how different different points of view. But you know, I see your argument. Well, we got to realize why are we watching this? We're watching, we're watching this for brutality. Right, but you got to protect the guy when the highlights or I'll buy it from his own timeline. That's a beautiful highlight. Highlight, highlight, highlight, highlight. If you stopped it, three punches before it still highlight. Yes, I agree. I agree to take on to, but it's not the worst. That was up the worst dot.

Speaker 2:          00:26:55       Oh, not at all. Like you know what's worse? You know what was worse? Rockhold and Chris Weidman, 100% was worse. It was a site that should have been stopped 100% when they weren't. When he was on top of them. I was saying, what does Luke Rockhold have to do to get a stoppage? Cause this is a, this is terrible. Like Chris Weidman is taken damaged. It's unnecessary. I'm not just unnecessary, but most likely when you take get beaten up like that, you're not going to recover. But really there've been many, many fights where they could have easily stopped it and the guy came back to rock cars are loud. Yes, Joe. There's a lot of fights like that. You got to let it go for the fans and pisses depends. 65 fucking dollars now come on. We don't want, we'd rather have them be taken serious early, late low.

Speaker 2:          00:27:37       Early is always going to win. I think Brock Lesnar Brock Lesnar looked better versus Shane carbon didn't. Weidman did. Oh hundred percent there really wasn't any damage. Right. He's getting hit but covering up, but there's no blood. But he was, he looked like he was there. Yes, he Weidman was calling. Thumped on face was literally like someone shot him with the greatest moments and made a bunch of peanuts because of that. That's why the fuck, that's why. That's why hardly nobody's doing MMA. Cause did the brutality. That's why. That's why people are paying $65 for it. If it was all decisions, no one would pay for anything. If it was a scroll that regardless, that wasn't that bad. We don't have to argue about it. I see Eddie's point of view and I, I'm, I'm leaning more towards your side. I think maybe it could have stopped it because you're just standing there taking shots.

Speaker 2:          00:28:23       He wasn't moving. No head trauma guys just stand there taking shots and he's not moving. He's waiting for the referee stopped. He was standing fully erect. He wasn't walking stud. He's a stud. He's in excellent shape but that's how a lot of guys die. Like a lot of the guys that have died from getting beat up, they didn't go down. They got beaten down. They sank into the ropes. How many people have died in MMA? 5,000 about MMA mostly, but boxing, mostly boxing. Well you know, one of the things that MMA has going for it is that you could fucking clinch, it's the cruelest shit ever to watch. A guy like rocked in a boxing match and the referees like pulling them off and holding onto the guy.

Speaker 2:          00:29:04       The only thing that's keeping that guy, that's the only thing keeping them alive. They're like, nope, you can't hang on. They're going to break up. Break it up. You're like, oh no. If you don't let go, I'm going to disqualify you. Oh Shit. It's the worst. It's really dumb. Mike Pyle, powerful Mike Pyle is a big win for him. Congratulations to him. He's been fighting for ever man. 40 years old. I remember the first time I heard his name Ed clay fit. There's a guy from Tennessee, may, Mike Pyle, he trains at my gym. Watch out for this guy. This is 2001 or 2000 so long ago. He's 40 now. It's crazy. No taller than head. I think MMA in a way has a longer lifespan regardless of what you're taking. Even if you're taking nothing, then boxing desk cause it's not as completely dependent upon reflexes. There's so many different skills to learn.

Speaker 2:          00:29:56       Oh Man. Yeah, it's trust is brutal. See that's when he looked at the left. Wait, stop. Stop. Stop wanting to make sure it, boom. Okay, we're done. He's still on his feet. Guy Wasn't doing shit though. Shaun's was just taking it because I didn't need to take that last name. All right. Violet. Poor baby. Rip His head off. Eddie. Eddie's die. Rip His head off. It wasn't the worst, but just trying to be honest here. That's it. I'm just trying. I, I see what you're saying, but poor baby man. This guys just fought. It's harder like, hey, that's what, that's what people are paying $65 and they know the, they know the game. I don't know man. I ain't know the game. They know it's brutal. Everybody's well aware they're in a fucking cage, man. Dude, you're throwing full blown Shin kicks to your skull. No one's trying to stop that.

Speaker 2:          00:30:45       That's what hurt. They are trying to stop that. That's the whole idea behind it. What would you rather take? What he went through against the fence like that with those elbows like that and you were kind of standing or Edson Barboza just throwing a straight fucking kicking your face. That switch. That switch kicked Kira floating around on the switch. I'm talking about, I'm talking about the wheel kick with the heel. That'd be the hardest hit. It doesn't feel good to take those Mike Pyle elbow all definitely. His fucking wheel kick is perfect. His switch kick in his wheelchair collect the best I've ever seen. The fastest to eat. His leg kicks are so God damn fast and everything. Barbels is probably the fastest kicker maybe I've ever seen. I think I've ever seen anybody kick his fastest. Him Not even close to, I can't even think. A lot of fucking chaos with those wheel kicks over the last five years.

Speaker 2:          00:31:37       Look at Wonderboy Thompson common now. Do you remember we used to talk about it and I was like just people don't know how to do it. Yeah, I go, people know how to do it. It's horrific. Yup. Because of it lands. I'd never seen anybody get wheel kicked in the head by a guy who is good and not go out. Like when you get healed, when a heel hits your head, sometimes you catch guys with the toes and those guys are okay, but you got to get slapped. Yeah, but when a heel hits you in the head from a guy who really knows how you got your boot on and you've got the bulldog, Wonderboy landed. No, no, no, no, no. You had your boot on as opposed to like this. Well, the, the key is it's just like throwing a punch. The idea, like when you throw in a punches, you don't want your hand completely clinched up until you're going to make impact because then slows the punch down so you're supposed to punch and then tighten your hand up as you're about to hit.

Speaker 2:          00:32:24       It's like kind of a timing thing and a lot of ways you want to keep everything as loose as possible while exploding in the right way. It's the same thing with a kick. When you throw in that wheel kick, you want everything to be almost like ballet until like halfway there and then halfway there you're pulling your leg back and you pull it and you put in pushing your foot forward and you stick in that heel out. But it doesn't come into like there. It's like as you're in the middle of the spin, once you get like they're, that's when everything hardens up and boom, and then you come across with a heel that's of Barboza. No MMA fighters. We're working on that shit and fuck me, nobody was working on, everyone is now though did PBS to make fun of it. She brought it up, I would say, you know like once people learn how to really throw, spinning back, kick to the body, I'm like, it's like getting hit by a car.

Speaker 2:          00:33:13       It was more really when people, when the people that already know how to do it, learn how to wrestle and did you get to, so they're not afraid to throw it because everybody that was karate guys and taekwondo guys in those times, but they were told by their MMA coach, don't fucking throw that shit cause these, these guys going to take you down to choke you out. So they were limited like, okay, we're going to keep it, you know, nice and simple and we're not going to do the spin kicks that we know what to do because we suck on the ground. But once like Stephen Thompson or Wonderboy, Wonderboy Ellenberg he's good on blue motherfucker. Yeah, you guys after it, Helen Burger said that it was a waste of time to throw those things. He's like, I'm not worried about is spinning to said waste of time.

Speaker 2:          00:33:51       That's what he said. He's like that's a waste of energy in the bend of the review. Did he really? Not In the preview. So Wonderboy moves like a fucking snake. That's the future right there like that. Like Conor Mcgregor, like a Diego Brandao. Those guys that just throw every opened. That's Chris. He throws a lot of fun. It's a great striker, isn't there? I'm not going back to those to those was a lot of spinning shit you throw, they throw some wild meat compared to as Joanne in the wild. Did you ever, did you ever throw spitting shit and you know what I'm saying? Never. Never ever. Why you're super athletic. No one really taught me. I never had, I never had a kickboxing coach or taekwondo coach. No one ever said you should. Every now and then it's good to have a fucking game over game over a weapon right there at said that we'll kick man.

Speaker 2:          00:34:43       It's no one ever told you that, huh? A lot of fighters though or don't throw much. Most I would say not 80% still don't throw them right, so a lot of them can't. Totally project thing. He's had to learn a lot of time on that shit and it's not exactly if, if you're putting it in, you know what priorities put spinning wheel kick number 30 is a long term project for such a shit. That's why it helps if you have a martial arts background star with when you're a kid, you learn that shit first. It becomes normal. Like if you see a little four year olds through onside kicks and then we'll kicks. It's hilarious and it's adorable because their legs are so, they're so used to throw their legs. Yeah. You know, if they throw their legs up in the air and it's normal and then as they get older and their legs get heavy, their body's used to the dynamic. Habib number, Madoff and Tony Ferguson, Agler Hearns and chase. Thank God he's going to fight Johnson again. I was like, what the fuck is this?

Speaker 1:          00:35:38       Settle the fuck down. What are the odds that that fight is really gonna take place Xero to not hurt all the time. He's unfortunately, he's super talented, but he's hurt all the time. He's going to get hurt again. Get you could get hurt again easily. You know what? He's going to hurt the not, I'd say. Which sucks. Yeah. Look, people get hurt, so that's a, there's a 50% chance of him getting hurt or 80% let's say 60% that's a lot. That's a Fox card apparent. That's a lot on my calendar. At least that's a Fox card. I don't know if that's going to be an fs one or Fox card. I don't think it's a, I don't think it's an Aka thing. How have you guys are getting hurt? I think Khabib and cane, they just have so much experience with wrestling and doing combat sports.

Speaker 1:          00:36:24       They're just getting up there, man. They trying to train like regular dudes and they're getting hurt while the people were like, oh, that's gay. Habib's young guy. He has a ton of experience. Does wasn't, they're world champions, master of sports and it's interesting because when it, yeah, just a wrestler and he beat the brakes off though. He looks like when you, when you're watching them compete, he looks like a wrestler. His wrestling wrestling is outstanding leg lock in people. Not really smashing people on the ground. Those guys, those guys in Russia do a lot of Greco too though. When you're Samo guy, you're also doing a lot of Greco typically. Well his, his clinch is insane is a bit of ability to control from the top is insane. Well, which was, I was going to say about Rockhold the other day. It's two fights in a row. Rockhold impressed me in a huge way with his ability to control from the top we against Machida and then against Weidman cause Machida was impressive.

Speaker 1:          00:37:17       But I was like, I think he had, but she had a fucked up before they went to the grounds of the temple thing. But you don't want to the ground. He destroyed them. I think Maci was already fucked up, but Weidman wasn't like, why? Why me? He just caught a wheel kick in a fight where there was real close fight. But once he got him on the ground, man, God damn, game two, I think he's, you know, he's Wyman was walking around it in one 93 apparently. And I mean rock two weeks before the fight with two 16 technique to his technique is nasty. You can't just say size sizes, it's conditions, obviously. God, he's also training with, I don't know, Daniel Cormier and came to Alaska. I think that's a huge part of it, man. I think that's a huge part of it because like Ledcor me, he said when he fought John Jones, he didn't have cane is corners that came was all fucked up from surgery and he's like, I made a big impact on me.

Speaker 1:          00:38:00       I really felt it. Whether or not that had anything to do with him blues into Jon Jones. You making that face or fights and I want to see if any job I want to see Anthony Johnson, John Jones fight. Oh yeah. I want to see that too. That's what I want to call me a, uh, I want to see him with cane in his corner training with him, see if that has any impact. But I'd like to go going down, right canes going through surgery. Apparently it's going to have back surgery. Really? He already had it. Yeah. You already had it. He already had him. What do you think about home and tape that came back? Surgeries? Not An easy thing. Like there's not like a small deal. You're taking pieces of, your disc is out for a while at a diskectomy, right? Is that correct? What does that mean?

Speaker 1:          00:38:40       That means the, the Gel that separates your discs. He had a piece of it removed because it was pressing into his nerve. She's, it's very controversial procedure because some people feel like you don't have to do it. Like Louie Simmons, the guy from west side Barbell, they uh, wanted to take him and fuse his discs and that's why he created that machine that I have outback, the hyper, uh, the uh, back, um, the fuck's it called reverse hyper reverse. Reverse hyper. Oh, that's a big glass of wine and not mad at that. Want to try and get, I hear setting that's trying to get drums in the background. My favorite county. Right. Tomahawks brought the fire, get involved in the case. What do you do with Kane? You got to be careful. You got to rehab that back, man. I don't, I'm not necessarily a big fan of cutting your back right away.

Speaker 1:          00:39:22       I think you got to take some time off a training and really heal that bitch up correctly. I'm pretty sure you already had surgery. Here's my thoughts though. If you want to get back into it really quick, that's the way to do it. But longterm health, I'm not entirely convinced I need, Oh, obviously I'm not a doctor, but I've recovered from bulging discs. I had a bulging disc in my back that doesn't exist anymore. And a bulging disc in my neck. It doesn't exist anymore. If you look at it on the Mri, it looks different. It's from long term Rehab. I had to take a lot of time off a rolling. I had to do spinal decompression with a, I did it at a, an an office with a chiropractor at first and then I got some machines we can strap them up, some mechanical sheet.

Speaker 1:          00:40:04       You strap your door at your house. I went through Regena keen injections. I went through a lot of rolfing and uh, like breaking apart scar tissue that was pulling on everything and that everything was all fucked up and tightened up. It was just like years and years of wear and tear. But now through that and through yoga, I don't have any of those issues anymore. They're gone. So I don't know what his, how bad his was, but I know mine was, my fucking hands were numb, you know, my left hand was going down my fingers, my, my two fingers, my ring finger and my pinkie finger were going numb. So let me ask you this Joe, what do you do with the heavyweight division? You have their doom fight. A guy like Rothwell what cane should concentrate on if I was cane, I mean get your body completely fucking healthy.

Speaker 1:          00:40:48       There's a lot of people that have like severely criticized his strength and conditioning videos that are online. I don't know if he works with this guy anymore, but he was working with a guy that was like the strength and conditioning coach and he had him doing these, you haven't seen this. Oh my God. Pull up. Is He doing some bullshit? Ain't oh yeah. Pull up cane. Uh, does a 200 pound kettle bell swings. His form is according to Steve Maxwell and according to a bunch of other respected Kettlebell trainers, completely wrong, and this guy's got him lifting this insane weight and doing this completely wrong. Almost like a shrug. He's 200 pounds. Yeah, I think it's more than 200. I think it's 200 plus here is, it's two or three pounds. So this is his train and like I'm telling you the reviews on, on youtube by people that suited.

Speaker 1:          00:41:33       Know what the fuck they're talking about. Like watch this. He's training it looks like, but look at this like what he's doing. He's doing a shrug. That's not a swing. That's not as swinging on a swing. Yeah. No wonder you're back's fucked up. You sir, you can totally get fucked up doing this. The fuck is that. It's wrong. And the guy had him doing leg extensions. We'll look. The guy's obviously a big fucking guy himself and didn't mean shipping. This is better than doing nothing. Right? You disagree, but it's not optimal. It's not the best. He fighting 100% it's a big ass kettlebell. Those bouncy balls that my son has. Yeah man, he's lost human as swinging and then doing like an upright row row. Yeah, it's, well it's a shrug. It's like he swings, he swings, he gets to wear his dick is, and then he showed a shitty shrug up row.

Speaker 1:          00:42:17       It's just fucking nother kettle but not a kettle bell swing. And it's probably not good for you. It doesn't look right. And Steve Maxwell was furious when Steve Maxwell saw it. He was like that. That is, that's like, he was like almost essentially calling you. I'm like malpractice. I told them I don't have a degree in it, but that looks terrible. So around the weight room I entirely fucking terrible. You got with Cain and you've got to fucking super athlete. A guy who just do what you tell him and fucking push through everything. Yeah. And that's probably one of the reasons why he's been injured. It's cause he's pushed through some, some pain that maybe you should lay off of. And I don't know. Like what? I mean, maybe this can help me for him is perfect. Maybe it's perfect. Maybe it's a real simple thing like maybe it's only sticking out a little bit on one side.

Speaker 1:          00:42:57       If they trim it, he'll be back to training four weeks. I don't know. But I know that for a lot of people what you can, you can get like real hasty and make a decision to jump into surgery and it's not the best decision, but especially when there's a lot of money on the line. We have to fight though. That's the thing for a lot of these guys. Like they might have to fight in six months so you'd have to get the surgery because realistically with six months of therapy you might not be ready again yet. Dude, he has to fight before six months. The heavyweight belts on your wait six months. Well, if his health is on the line and going flying arm triangle, if his health is on the line, man, this guy's good man would wait. Is this, is this heavyweight two oh five this is the main card. No, May, yeah. Mischka Serp Serp. Cool. KNAUF is Russian Guy Hop Russian dud couple of one two bodies on them.

Speaker 1:          00:43:46       That was pretty brutal. Good hair. Good hair on that guy. I'm just saying, Joe, you, if he's out six months, you're gonna have to have it. Well, you don't have the title, the title, you're going to have somebody else buy a Rothwell. Yeah. He would do both of them in that time that it takes him to realistically come back. Yes. But he's got, I don't Dunno. He's got to be careful and he's just, he's still fairly young. I mean, I think Keynes like what? 34 34 is a lot of experience. You know what I'm saying? Like it catches up, but he could realistically fight at the highest level for the next three years, but these injuries, wow. Yeah. I Dunno. It's real controversial, but in my experience, talking to different doctors, there's doctors that say she gets surgery and there's doctors should say, you should absolutely not concerned scale until you've exhausted all the options.

Speaker 1:          00:44:33       Yeah. Either way. Still in the grace of all time heavyweights easily. Well, Jake shields, they were telling him he was fucked. What happened? You're telling him he couldn't, couldn't fight again. You should stop training started and he was really mad. He's like, he's fucking doctors are so negative fan because first of all they're just regular doctors. Dee Dee used to dealing with regular people. Yeah. A lot of them not you stealing with the elite athletes and guys who are willing to go through like the kind of rehab that a guy like Jake shields is willing to go through like some serious fucking pain and discomfort. But he got through it. He's fighting now. He just backed out of it. Is fighting a world series. Apparently it's a contract thing. Yep. Do you know the full details? I don't. Apparently what it is is it's, it's a title fight.

Speaker 1:          00:45:12       So if he fights for the title because Paul Harris got stripped this trip. Paul Harris after the John Fitch fight. Cause they say held it too long. Right? Was it a Fitch? Fine. I thought he know his eyes. Yeah. Stripped him after that and then, but here's the thing about that, the eye gouge. Like you either stop the fight like while it's happening. Yeah. You don't let it go. I can't see and then to to like to a strip of afterwards for I gouges. It's weird. That's super unprecedented. Well, maybe they saw tape and realized he was dragging his finger through it. He was too. He was hiding what he was doing. It was different. She'll just like, yeah, like transfer on midstream oil and it was very evident. Right. Replay through one solid. Yeah. They're just like, ah, you're good. Just keep on. Keep on. One's a cheater.

Speaker 1:          00:45:56       He was cheating. He was definitely sticking fingers in the eye. That was a real bad guy. What people got mad about was the Kimora. He held the Camorra, but I don't think that was that bad because the referee was in the wrong place. The referee, fuck, don't look at it again. He's tapping his back. You're expecting him to recognize that that's a referee. Tapping is back in the middle of a ferocious cage fight. The referee supposed to be in between the two of them. He's supposed to stop it if it was a normal guy known for it. He's done it so often. If it was a normal guy, like if it was you, if you had Mitch reone in that same position, you hit that Kamora and you held it for that long. Why the referee was tapping you. I do not think you'd get the same kind of grief.

Speaker 1:          00:46:29       I agree. I think you would say I was in the middle of the fight. I didn't even realize referees tap me. I didn't see him cause the referees in the wrong place. The referee in that position, it's supposed to get in between the fighters. He supposed to be in front so he could look him in the eye. We'll pour Horace has that Kimora he was out of place. He was over here. He's supposed to be over here. What about Paul Harris versus Gary telling him, damn, I love that. Where's that taking preschool gangsters. Gary telenet holds. Explain to Gary. Tony Blair, I hope Carrie is a Jujitsu show, the Jujitsu event held in England. It's Kinda like metamorris. They have a bunch of single matches that are submission only and I think if there's no submission it ends up being a draw 20 minutes. It's just like metamorris in that respect. I think 1520 minutes. I'm like that. And they put on great shows, great match ups and a man, Gary Tonin is taken on. I saw that. That is so fucking gangster. I agree with. I saw scared wants to, he's the only guy that's asking for Paul Horez. Nobody wants

Speaker 2:          00:47:30       Paul Harris. Just in general buddy. The last five guys that are far powers. It's because they just, they offered the fucking fight to them and had no one's going after him, you know, and then just graphical Horace. It's, you know, it's highly possible that he's going to Eleague luck Paul Harris. But it gives you an idea how good Jake shields was because he was beating Paul Harris up on the ground. He was controlling his body. He's unbelievable. Hey Jake. Jake shields is one of the past. Hey tone in though, when we saw him at your event, I was, yeah, you were talking to of mirror last time I saw something like a motherfucker. He was eating these dudes up. Well. Then leg lock came that John Danaher, her leg lock game is very high level man. Him and Eddie, Eddie Cummins, the, both of those guys are fucking wizards man.

Speaker 2:          00:48:14       And Danaher apparently is a wizard to like, I never seen Donna her role, but everybody says he's just, he's sad. He's so God damn smart and I'll start it with dean lister Douglas or went to [inaudible] in like late nineties 2000 2001 and dean lister came into the Jujitsu world already as a sambal guy. So he was always the guy, even as a white belt, as a blue belt in southern California. Dean, we grew up together, Jujitsu. He was always that leg lock dude, that Samo guy who got into Jujitsu. So that dude dean lister goes on to win Abu Dhabi, absolute leg lock and fuck and everybody that knee bar that he hits Salo Roberto with Holy Shit in 2003 watch that shit to the knee bar. He had solid Robero solar barrel was like one of the best ever, one of the greatest players ever. And doing that.

Speaker 2:          00:49:02       That knee bar that he got him with was Gary Tone and I don't want the current rank are, but as he number one, he in person, he might be the best I've ever seen real official rankings because there's a point, there's a point game and then there's a submission only game. But, but let me finish really quick. So that guy, dean lister, he goes to Hem Zos and Danaher's there Danaher's a a little prodigy and he leaves an impression with a debt. Danner, I'm sure he left. Uh, he left a couple, oh man, he's fucked is Jello. And the Danaher took what he learned from Dean lister and he just blew that shit up. And Dan is like a scientist, I think he's a physicist or something or so rock. Under Armour has her phd in philosophy and something like that. Philosophy and Houston, hence I used to give him, hence her back.

Speaker 2:          00:49:49       This is literally, I don't know, I've got 2003 or whatever. Hansa when somebody come into kind of challenge and somebody who's really good, he would kind of casually give John, he'd said, roll with John for a while and see how you do first. And John would just, you'd watch him tap these dudes like these really good Samo guys or whoever they were and he just, just like, he was moving in slow motion. He's a minimalist, right? He's just really smart ones. He was a builder or power lifter and then just ridiculous as strong and he wanted to learn martial arts to deal with, like in bouncing

Speaker 1:          00:50:28       situations, he realized I should probably have some skills. That's insane. Yeah. I had no idea. He doesn't look like it now, but he's, he's still obviously very strong. If you look at him, he's thick and fit, but apparently he used to be like really bad and my summer a UFC event, he was like at the bar afterwards and he had on a fucking rash guard and some jeans tucked in. No fucks given me. These guys have Alzheimer's wedding. That's his thing. He was dead. So gangster always salmon. Her and I, every time he wasn't stop foods. Look, he's created Eddie Cummings, Gary Tonin, because Gary Tonin went to hens, owes to train with Danner and he didn't have any leg locks. He was all rear naked choke. He had his, you know, basic. He was already a black belt. He went to Dan or that's when he started learning the leg locks from him and through Eddie Cummings.

Speaker 1:          00:51:11       They, you know, then him and Eddie come and just became like best friends and training partners. I was so impressed with Gary. I took, I took privates from John Donner. Yes, like probably five and that was, I got this new guy, Gordon Ryan who just got his black belt is fucking amazing as well as the new guy. You're going to shuck corn. She knows another leg lock master the people. Forget Dave Terrell. You remember Dave to WRAL versus Ricardo Almeida in 2003 in Abu Dhabi. Don't remember that dude. Dave Terrell had some nasty ass fucking leg locks. Dave Tarell was so explosive. I've heard legendary stories about him in the training room. He's the best ever. I saw it. I was seeing him compete like watching him and Abu Dhabi, I always expected he was going to be UFC champion because he went into MMA, starts smashing people. He knocked out Matt Lindland at first round, but Evan Tanner got him and he also had a series of catastrophic ear injuries.

Speaker 1:          00:52:05       He had to have it removed from his head. Why can't, it's like staff inside his head from his ear. His ears were just Gonzo, right? They were like these just fucking ash trays on his head. Hard as a rock, just all cauliflower. Dot. But apparently like just years and years of hard training yet he got an infection inside his ear and they had to take it on his bike, his whole fucking ear off his head, clean it all out, like try to fuse it and swap it and cauterize it. She get could get it to stop oozing, pus you in, your ear falls off and it didn't work. They had to do it again like he's got he, he went through like, and like when your ears fucked. Have you ever had an earache or can your, your equilibrium's off? You can't do shit or worse. So he's like a mythical creature and uh, nor nor cal two. And there's so many crazy stories about that guy who was Syme compete. I was like, that fucking guy moves like a ghost as fast as fuck. And his students, uh, one of them, Joe Soto, they're so good at leg lock defense. Joe Soto, when you're generally, when you game plan against Eddie Cummings, the game plan is stay away from any kind of footsie battles you don't want to battle was at. Avoid it. Avoid it. Try to do the, the, the Super Basic Jujitsu strategy. Like what? Uh, um,

Speaker 2:          00:53:26       I think it was Lucas dupree and Abu Dhabi did a Gary Tonin. It was either Lucas the pre or Leandra low. I kicked those guys mixed up all the time on, well, one of those guys that I will dobby when against Gary Tonin and he just straight knee slice, boom. Stayed tight, stayed in side control, top half tight. Never let Gary get anywhere near his legs. You know, that's the game plan against a leg lock guy like Eddie come. That's it. You try to play footsies with them, you're, you're retarded. But Joe Soto, he went in there in the finals, that Ebi three, he went in there and just said, he sat on his ass and I'm gonna play footsies with Eddie comes and it wore for a long time and everybody was just blown away. It's like, how the fuck is he leaving his legs out there for Eddie Cummins grafters legs and Joe Soto just displayed just this incredible, uh, of defense.

Speaker 2:          00:54:14       His leg lock defense. I was reffing gone. What the fuck dude? Is He really playing? Footsies with Eddie coming? He ended up getting caught. Eddie Cummins did catch him, but he showed tremendous fucking savagery for going in there and plan legs with them. And I talked to him afterwards and he said, dude, I, I roll with Dave Tarell all the Goddamn time that guys always after our legs. Are you kidding me? We're used to this shit kill or be killed if you're in a leg lock. Speaking of submissions, Cummings knees all fucked up. How about your boy Rob Barnett and Roswell? And so it'll fuck called that insane, insane. Insane. Apparently when Rothwell gets a hold of your neck, he just knows how to speak. He was showing me what he got him in. Oh, that's horrible. I don't know how his hands are though. I don't know how he's gripping his hand.

Speaker 2:          00:54:58       I don't know it is either. It's a 10 finger essentially, but the coach wanted to call it a go. Go choke hard because it, it goes against your throat. Sort of like a Google Plata or if there's no one hot on the UFC division heavyweight division right now, then no Rothwell's the police. He's the beast. You'd like being that guy right now. Their confidence. He pays the bees too though. It's like it's real close like well after Steve Bay destroyed Orlowski like that. Steve Bay's right in there. Man will face Mickey Gal. It is year apparently one earlier tonight he did and he's a, I was hearing a lot of criticisms about a face off. Cm punk walked in. It was the first prelim ever to have a face off. I just feel like, I don't know why he would want to do that. I feel like if he was smart he would just start fighting and small organizations, you know, I get that you want to get a lot of money because I'm the UFC is where it's at with money.

Speaker 2:          00:55:51       But I would think like the smart move is what he's already done training wise. Go to a real camp. He goes to Rufus, perfect roof is going to teach him how to uh, strike as good as anybody in the world. Agree. And then you got real good wrestling with Ben Aspirin. You got a real good Jujitsu, you got everything there, everything, everything there. I heard they offered him, I heard they offered him and go through the tough show and he's like, Nah man, I'm trying to write to the shell. So I think tough would have been better for them. You get ratings. We see how he does. He gets warm up and then, you know, then he goes, but for your first fight to be in that octagon, good fucking who was Mickey gauzy tough though? Well, he's a newcomer. They found them on that looking for a fight show on HBO and a small show or in a youtube rather in a small organization.

Speaker 2:          00:56:33       We are looking for it. He's a, he's a brown belt brown belt. Significant that. That's what I read earlier today after he won, he won by submission. They said he was a brown. I heard, I heard blue and purple. The UFC said brown belt, so I don't know. Okay, well we might've gone is brown right before the fight. You know a little pump me up. That's three more belts ahead of cm punk that she goes to the ground. Yes. That's a big difference. So who knows what cm punk has been able to do in the, well, he's been training for over a year. Can you imagine if cm punk goes in and she gets murked? It'd be like from the waterboy when Michigan, the water boy water boy, he certainly could write, he could turn to get Merkt. Who knows if this kid can strike, like if he can strike, if the kid has, you could use it to any good strike.

Speaker 2:          00:57:18       Good luck. Learn how striking a year she's got doesn't have any striking under him. Can you imagine? Okay, like you're going to harass signs, strike some, some dude who's got like some serious knockout power and you're going to practice for a year. That's ridiculous. I like cm punk as a person, but for the sport I think it's best if he gets murked was that fucked all the way going to make headlines. I'm happy when anybody says gets marked me too. But gets high a style like when you get stuck, I forget about rumble and Jon Jones go, you never know man. Rumble could starch him and we said starts at like, oh he could. He could a good start to anybody. Anybody in the world rumble can hit you on the temple and your shit could just go born you on your way. I think John mops the floor.

Speaker 2:          00:58:01       He has the biggest head and long steep I've ever seen. I rob could almost head is gigantic. It's a big fucking head. If he connects against Jon Jones, that's, I don't think you will though. I think John takes him down. Where's the mountain? Takes us heart. People forget the Steepbank got stopped by skyscraper. Stephan's truth come out. Yeah. Stepdad knocked knockdowns truth, man. He's had some real tough fights. There's a guy who has had some real tough fights. He's had some like brutal knockout losses to the losses and put seven foot tall basketball back in the day. The kid had some mad potential and still does because I was 26 27 right? Yes. So many fights on man. His Age is not what I count. I count. He has what? 40 fights? Some shit. He's had some ruthless knockouts inside the octagon. And when's the last time you saw seven foot tall grandpa? Anyone? They don't live long. Anybody, anybody? No, they don't know. Yeah, they all, they're all have heart conditions. They're just too big one. If they can mitigate that today, man, when, if they understand like what it is that though, like you're dying, so fuck yourself bro.

Speaker 2:          00:59:12       Betty and I both are going to be a hundred. I'll be, I'm on the back nine for sure. Well, you know what though? Honestly do you really to live past 80 fucking what kind of dog? Shit. Arthritis. Written existence is that. Oh, by former athletes, former athlete pass 80 good lord and less than 40 years from now. Who the fuck knows? Who knows? Three Daddy. What's going to happen when I'm 45 and he's yeah, asked me that for Ron. I said, Shit, you'll be a copy of all. They're going to be dead. That's what I said. I just don't want to be dead when he's going to be 45 [inaudible] 23rd sorry. I know that you got to call us. Oh, April 23rd I'm Jim. John Jones has been lifting weights. Hey, I love it. All John's lifting weights. Everyone was like, no, he's, he's a good guy now. Everything's all good. Like cause he's post pictures, lifting weights. He's a fucking monster now.

Speaker 2:          01:00:18       John John's is ridiculous. Good luck beating him. Yeah. And I don't think rumbles going to wait for a, for a title shot. Yeah. Now I said he's not going to like it. I wouldn't wait to eat if I was wrong by wood, some quick work in. And if he got busted with coke, again, blind beggar. I love the guy. We said, oh shit, that ain't snowflake. I'm a fucker. Came riding shot a low single, just stayed on it. Also hanging on to a Kamora big guy. So Hutto Johnson versus, that's the cool manner. Is that the Olympic wrestler to gold medalists? Yeah, he bites it. Those guys are super smart. I was like, Ooh, girl is division guys are quick. That's what I say. This guy's a scramble. What were we're talking about? Are we just talking about a rumble and that quick work? Ryan Bader. Oh, I keep trying to finish that.

Speaker 2:          01:01:23       Uh, Kimora like that's a hard move to pull off on a strong dude as it is. Right? A guy strong is rumble was on top and you don't even have half panic I think. But he had no control when he was holding on to it. He had to do something with his legs. He just didn't have the dexterity to get into a position, like a half guard or something and then get up to the like to the dog fight, right. Rumble said, what the fuck is thinking at empty half at one point, right? Well the problem is he's so fucking strong, explosive. The beginning of the round, he's 100% he's not even remotely tired. I jumped on your back or he's got you on your back and it's not top of you and you know one of those punches is going to change your life. One Punch. Just one. You gotta be really good on your back. That's all that is. You gotta be really fun when you take him to grant. John Jones is going to ram right there. He tried to take an ankle. No, I'm saying to John Jones, gonna take rumble down. Maybe. I promise he's going to incite

Speaker 1:          01:02:20       trip. I'm take them down my, he's going to break them and the TKL they might not. Man, you're so confident. How could you say that? You're so calm. Fucking, I was just going to happen. Dan was getting better and better and now they're just trying to, when Neil Ballantyne, he's getting his grappling in order. I hear you Joe. It's all, yeah, I agree. He's a monster. Advertised. Johnson was Johnson at Juco champion. He asked. He might, he might, he has the skills to starch. Anyone in the words of Joe Rogan. But yeah, he's got the skills to stiffen them all up. It's mother whether or not he can apply it against the very best of the best, but he's at this edge like I don't think he's done improving. So he's had this edge right now. We're only a guy like core me. Aa Can beat him cause everybody else, Jimmy Manawan, everybody gets the fuck beat out of him.

Speaker 1:          01:03:03       Gustafson gets the fuck beat. David. I think it's five and five. We'll take a flight has been a rumble. Johnson's good fight match up. Got this and got headbutted. Actually they had one fight and he starts, he smashed him. Yeah, I know. I'm saying that doesn't happen every time. I don't know when they don't know what happens every time you got a good point, no one goes, it might not happen every time, but with the data that we have currently available, [inaudible] scary guy who knocks everybody dead. He knocked him dead. And so you've got to think, okay, first of all, the kind of beating that Gustafson took in that fight. You don't want to take it again. I agree that that was a bad beat about the data when going to see Anthony Johnson Bracey break. He broke him. He definitely broke guy break John Jones, who's broken?

Speaker 1:          01:03:56       Everybody including DC DC. That's not good. Let's look at the data we have here according to the data. Right, but that we're not talking about him. We were talking about Gustafson. I know you're talking about, I'm saying, but you got Jamie pull up that got, but that was a monster fucking fight. But definitely looks like watch this and everybody can get broken. Everybody. If a guy says, break you, really multiple guy, great ones don't get broke because they're not, they don't fight anybody that much better than them at Lombardi said. Vince Lombardi said, fatigue makes cowards of us all. And that's a great shirt. Look, I'll look up fatigue. John was against mess of men, right? Yeah. Yeah. I've thought of that all the time. Yeah, it makes me a pussy. Ah, retired. I turned to such. Everyone does cardio shaves motherfucker, but you know what man, I've been getting into this straight cardio over the last few months.

Speaker 1:          01:04:56       I've been doing like these hardcore cardio workouts just because I hate them. What are you talking about? Like what kind of ridiculous sprints? Like not like a Tabata protocol, but I do a 32nd on 32nd off on an elliptical machine. I I adjusted from 16 which is pretty hard. Pretty stiff to 20 which is like you're wrestling this fucking thing and I'll do these death sprints. 30 and 30 that's good. Does it for how many 30 offhand? It depends on, it depends on what I'm trying to do, but I do, I do a 45 minute workout and what I'm doing the 45 minute workout, the first 15 minutes, I'm just getting everything ramped up. So the first 15 minutes was no sprints. The first 15 minutes just keep it on 16 and going out at a very fast pace. Then once I get to the first 15 minutes and I'm sweating, then it's death runs.

Speaker 1:          01:05:42       I go on these 30 segment death runs it for a whole 30 minutes depending upon how much, how long I can last, how many death runs I can do. Cause sometimes I can't do the death runs. I just have to just pace myself at 16 but then when I feel like I've got my heart rate down, cause my, my elliptical things got a little heart rate thing. Kind of just want to go. Do you have that heart rate monitor? Beast of a workout? You just got to, oh they're all, they all can. Everybody uses elliptical machines. They just kind of go steady. But if you go on a death run, you got to go on a save your life, save your loved one, save your mom from fucking I do it. I just do it. No, but I mean like what makes you a spread?

Speaker 1:          01:06:20       My inner insecurity. Like think you're sprinting, but you're like during the sprint time you're like, you know, man, I'm fucking proud as fast as I can, whatever. There's a number of revolutions per minute and I want to keep it above a certain number. I don't remember. I don't remember what it is at at one 80 or at um, at 20 but at somewhere where you want your heart rate to be somewhere around one 80 and the, I forget what the revolutions are because there are different on the one that I use at the gym versus the one that I use at home. But you could have a number where you could keep it at that number. So it's at like one 47 I think. So when you hit one 47 and you just got to fucking keep it there for 30 seconds and it's big, deep Wim Hoff breaths the whole time and just wrestle this thing for 30 seconds. Do you know it's a nightmare and relax. Yeah. You know, it's a nightmare. He's setting just a little something. Set the treadmill at 15 incline and it put it at four miles an hour and walk, walk for for 15 minutes. Try to try to stay small pace towards their kill. You did. I have, I have. I talked about what the cardio I did from Metamora sprinting in the pool. Yeah. Yeah. That's awesome. Well, Tim Ferriss runs death runs in recovery. That's what it's all about. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          01:07:32       Think about the pool thing though, is the way I did it was there's a giant clock and every time it hits 12, you sprint across the pool. So when you get to the end of the pool, whatever's left in that minute, you get to rest. Right? Yeah. So when you're, when you're doing that, no one has to tell you bust ass, you're busting ass to rest. Yeah. Cause you know, after the first, uh, maybe six laps or easy, soon as the clock hits 12, you bust ass across the pool. Your sprint, you get past and it's like you got 35 seconds to rest and then you rest and you do it back. As soon as it hits the 12 boom after like 12 dad in the pool. And no matter how chaotic it doesn't take long breathing is you got

Speaker 2:          01:08:16       it. No matter how tired you are, you got to keep your breathing on point because to swim your shit. So you got, you're like dying. But at the same time, there's something in your mind and you're on dude, survival mode, you're dying, but you're breathing's gotta be perfectly, you're going to swallow water, you're going to swallow water and use. That to me was super fucking crucial in the grappling. Yeah, exactly. Wrestling with no matter what you're breathing, no matter how chaotic your situation is, it, it, it, it, uh, you practice breathing and chaotic situations. Cause if you, if you a hiccup at all, you swallow water. This is a good fight. Allows that Makowski and Joseph Benavidez this is a very good fight. I've been looking forward to this. Benevidez get another title shot. You think maybe he's down at muscle farm and he's a training with bang again, doing all his training with bang.

Speaker 2:          01:09:05       Uh, I don't know what's going on with those guys in Sacramento. What's happening? Like how many, how often they're, him and Lance Palmer had been bouncing all over. I don't mean to cut you off. Joe Jimenez Palmer had been bouncing all over though to Jackson's and went to muscle farm and a must for me. No, it's t they got a hell of a team down there. Tj, Lance Palmer. Benevidez Neil magni batch will benefit. Has got to do what he's gotta do. I mean, he doesn't have any meat in many years left. I think he's in his thirties as well. And especially, I think he's 34 but at one oh boy. Wow. What's he do if he loses 25 well, we wouldn't be loses to McCroskey tonight and Makowski beats this guy, but maybe just took them down. I agree. Let's say he fights Dj for a third time. He loses.

Speaker 2:          01:09:45       Hey man, we can't do four. I'm sorry. I can't do it for, we got to move on. Well, what does he do then? It's a real question. Opens a gym. Did you see, did you see Justin Scoggins today? Yes. Jesus Christ Jesus. He looked fantastic and fucking Scoggins. Holy Shit. Holy Shit. God Damn Dude. Yes. That karate style shit about him, dude. I'm, I'm not like you guys. I'm not like an encyclopedia right now. There's too many UFC. He's like, I can barely keep up. I didn't know what the fuck he was, but I saw him for the first time today, the prelim and I, I was thinking, Holy Shit, I guess Ray Borg, because before, before the fight started, they had mentioned they got Scroggins thinks he has the best movement in MMA. And I'm like, oh my motherfucking God, how retarded can this guy be the best fucking retard. And then after one round I'm like, okay, he might have here, can you, can you keep the pace?

Speaker 2:          01:10:46       And then he was, he looked really good on the corner is grounded cause he rests, his wrestling was very good and it's striking. Was this like coming from also, he left and he's fighting right at it. He's thrown every kick and spinning everything like Holy Shit. He's one of the best guys at standing in that sideways karate style stance and using their front leg too. He Front Lake side kicks your Thigh Front Lake sidekicks. I Dunno if brainless does that mother fucker. I'm correct. Or, but he was talking about how, and I don't know, like I said, I don't know anything about Scroggins, but Brian, Stan was saying that when he fights a southpaw, he fights more karate. And when he fights ride that, you know, Orthodox, he's fighting more and more. We tire or something like that. Like we fighting right hand the style and it's finally left hand this style.

Speaker 2:          01:11:30       I'm like, Holy Shit, how cool is that style? But he changes it up. Like right here. I feel good when we tie right here. I'm a karate guy. You know why be fucked? It's amazing. His, his sideways stance allows them to use that front leg. So if you're finding a guy that doesn't know like that style, you can get away with a lot of shit. Like if you're used to a guy who's fighting Moy Thai style, would that light front leg and the more of a, like a closed off stance, you can get away with that with a Moy Thai guy, but with a karate guy, he'll stand sideways. Like what standards. Dot. Yeah. He'll stay on sideways and throw those fucking front leg sidekicks. And you don't know what to do. Like he throws him from way outside. He's like a lot of these Moyie Thai style guys.

Speaker 2:          01:12:12       They're standing right in front of each other for Zach. What's north? South? He's all over the place. It's still trained. Anybody describe a fighter like that? Have you ever heard of that before? No. Goggins probably told him that, you know, he probably had a conversation with them about the different then before. Have you heard? I've never heard that before, but it makes sense if you see how good he is. Birthday switch. They're playing the same shit. When the mayor, there's like, Holy Shit. Well you know who else is like super versatile and uh, being able to uh, switch back and forth. Connor's a wizard with some good uh, former Strikeforce champion. Just fought welterweight. Uh, dammit. Saturday. Yes. Terex affidavit. It's fucking hair happening as a wizard and going back karate style. He had Dutch kickboxer. What does he, um, no, not Dutch. He is from Germany.

Speaker 2:          01:13:09       He's a German kickbox no, Turkish targeting is Turkish. No, I want to say Belgium from Belgium. That's Chris from Brussels. He's from where, uh, vandamme his muscles from. Well, there you go. There you go. I love me man. He's the reason I thought, man, I want to meet him a couple of times. Damn movie. I've seen him a couple times in and he's got tight jeans on. Always have beautiful bug kind of Fan Paul ass and a fanny pack bubble. But with a fanny pack. He still has one. I just do rocks when he lives in Marina del Rey. I live in Marina del Rey. I see him all the time driving. I don't want a super, he meet. We should have them on. Ah. Oh my God. He's a great guy.

He existed back in the day where people bought DVDs. Oh Shit. This is a good fight. Makowski on top. He existed back in the day of blockbuster. Back in the day where people would buy movies. You get a percentage of that. You get a percentage of it when they sell it to showtime, Hbo, Cinemax, Tvs, all that shit. He got to pretend you have all of that. I use ball to you. He was producing, he was a part of the ownership of those films. He might have made an ungodly amount of money. Yeah.

He's paying them to show up a fight, but they choreograph press conferences. He would fuck up everyone in this room. Maybe he's thought about actually fighting about three or four times, but most of the time what it is is just getting together and saying that you're thinking about fighting and to schedule a it, but I have movies tend to, he blinded somebody in one of his movies with that wheel kick and he had to do a deposition at his, at a trial about how, look at him. Look at him. He's a brilliant, hey, who's better looking at Denver, Joe Real. Oh, he's definitely not as good looking as Alan. Now back in the day time in the day, it was really close to him all day.

Speaker 4:          01:18:58       There's no one better looking than Allen Joe ban that just different. You don't get better looking. That's a good cost is not going to be, this is back. Oh Shit. Look at this. Meanwhile we don't have any idea who won and if any of you fuckers try to say Benevidez get robbed. I was watching it, I think is head comes out. We would do a worse job than you know. Name your least favorite judge. I got benefit as the head cause he's been fucked. Turned to the screen. Get tired. I can feel it. I could feel it. Do you put the jeans on man, right? No sweats off. Put those genes out right now. Brian cal and a pair of the barbell jeans. So props to barbell jeans. Eddie Bravo, which just took the second large glass of Vino low. If you were in a fine restaurant, it's a double son. Come on most. Of course he pours a slight sipping thing. It's a, this is a delicious

Speaker 1:          01:20:08       wine by the way. Let me tell you something about Cowan. This mother fucker knows his one. I've got a dinner with him and he gets in a conversation with this shit more. Yay. The bed says, what do you have in a burgundy from 97 d? And the guy goes, oh shit, this mother fucker's for real cow. Start talking about different comp, different grapes that are grown on different hillsides, and he'll explain, he'll explain some shit. We were at this restaurant and the small we AA was like, yes, correct. That's correct. Correct. Who started, he started talking about, oh my God, I got to work on your technique. Inside Kik is you gotta pick your knee up. I think John Claude van Damme. Where's those two though? For sure. Stretch. That's why you have to put your knee up higher. They look good and there's nothing that has nothing to do with stretching. It's just you just haven't thrown a sidekick in a while. It's a little rusty. You can do it. You gotta put your socks on before he came back and people ask him, why do you want to put your socks on? Does that help your kicking? You want to put a shoe on? Oh, you like to kick with shoes on?

Speaker 1:          01:21:15       Do you still wear those shiny shoes so that you could throw a roundhouse kicks quicker cause he pivots. If you have a shiny sol like that's terrible. You got to pick your knee up. You have no, see it's not bad, but you have a inherent flaw in your technique that probably was never, never explained to you for 49 million. Ain't bad. It's pretty good. Not Right. I wouldn't want to get hit by that. Get hit hidden. Riding your shower. That's where you would get hit. Oh Shit. I washed my hands still spinning kicks. Right dude, it's wrong though. Sounds those genes or Helen.

Speaker 1:          01:22:02       I used to being serious there. Are you being serious? Show me what? Show me a real front lake side for real. All Bullshit. All Bullshit. Well, just this from here and just throw it. Let me see the spinning one. Show him spinning. One kick. Yeah, that's my favorite that he does. It's my favorite two old tear you. You just all you have to do different. The all you're doing wrong. You're coming up. You're foot is going up from the ground like an almost like a half moon, right? Yeah. You want to get your knee up higher. That's one of the cool things about those jeans. Way Higher than that. You cool things about those June. Yeah. There's genes. These genes that were wearing, they're like sweat pants, man. You she just had no, no, no. Don't throw the kick until your knee is up. Get your knee up first and then throw the kick. The problem is you're doing both at the same time. No, no, no. Don't throw the kick into your knees up hot. Lift your knee up way high past your waist and then throw the kick. Yes, me up first and then don't look over your stomach. Look over your shoulder. Yeah, but knee first here. Hold on. This fucking hysterical.

Speaker 2:          01:23:07       This is ridiculous. That's why I'm drunk. I can't watch. Watch Joe is going to go off. Dude. Genes on genes, on genes here, up here, up. So flexible pipe companion from here. Turn your shoulder to the right turn. You shown to the right to right now. Extent extension and extension straight. Don't look over your stomach. Look over your shoulder like this. Like that. That's how you look. I know that's not yet. That's the flexible. You're fine left right from here. Watch. Oh sons. Damn fucking blush. You lift your knee and then kick. I still think John Claude van Damme beats the fuck out of both of you. Then kick watch one too. Okay. Ready? I'm not mad at Joe's format. All know no one and then two one up. All right, and he can do play by play. Shit. Don't look on your stomach. I don't know what the fuck.

Speaker 2:          01:24:12       Well, I know John Claude van Damme would be proud. Are you calling your shoulder? Look, I'm throwing it up here. I'm like this. I'm never like this. Look at Joe's ass. When he throws the kick, it's just looking at it. Don't look, don't look at the foot. He has a set of [inaudible]. Look at the foot honeydews on them, right into the glutes. Looking deeply into them. Dude, I'd love to see our actual taekwondo match. Shrink, Callen and relevant. I would just stare at their asses to my barbell fucking monster. They're awesome. Right? Yeah, we, you see my cakes, you see mine? Just fundamentally a little off a little bit. He's been here. So you get there, but that dose does, that span. Here is, everybody fucks that up. Everybody fucks that up. It's a number one thing about the side kick that people get wrong and it changes everything. If you learn to do it right, you learned to get that knee up high. The power differences fucking substantial. No, no. You just gotta do it right with Rogan's help. You could be the best kick yourself.

Speaker 2:          01:25:23       Dear diary today. Here's a two bro. Here's the thing. You don't just throw it, you have to throw it right or don't throw it right. You can't be happy with the scoop and the scoop doesn't exist. Right? You can't do it. Fuck your shit. Kick like that. I'd be sick for a year. Just run through a bad time. But it's not, it's not a bad sidekick. It's just you need to learn how to do it right. You need a knee has to come up high and then you can do it right. Like once, once I showed you how to do it, you were doing it way better. I'll tell you right. Last one was the best one. I'll tell you right now. You feel that sidekick with John Claude van Damme in here. He's gonna throw up. He's never coming back. No Dude, can we get better? I'm Dallas to Kim's dangerous.

Speaker 2:          01:26:08       It's real simple. You either do it right or you don't do it and that's the only way to be a good test is 5:00 AM all ready for my, my, my last cell. You will get quicker. You'll feel it. I'll put a pad you up like Justin. I put Justin my Laos and pads. Well I pay him. Well that's why I hit him on heavy bags cause you'd be like Freddie Roach about three years. Leg Pads on him. I have leg one guy body pat on him. I don't kick them in the body though. I only kicked him in the tie pads but I fucked him up with body shots like body shots, flexeril. It's so fun. It gets to the point where here like paying like dudes to not wear pads. Let me fuck you up. Don't think someone's done that and you're just bringing them in. You just come in and you take a beating and it'll give you fucking thousand dollars time for the kid and he can't. You know too much about brain damage.

Speaker 2:          01:27:07       Who knows what's going on with your [inaudible] going on with your liver. When you get fucking like they'll sign Joe's kick cowboy and the body in that need of the body. Hi. Did you show him those spinning heel kicks and so his body to listen, man. People get launched across the fucking the floor from attorney side kick to the body. They get launched back kicks. How many, well, there's a video of me on youtube kicking the guard and he soars. Yeah, he sources the video of me doing that and they took it down because it's too dense. Too dangerous. Makes Sense. I slew him. I said, yeah, I told you guys, I called it a love that guy. Oh Shit. He was right. I was playing a lot of games week in this corner. A kick to the body is always painful because your leg is strong.

Speaker 2:          01:27:59       Even if you have a half ass kick, he throws a kick to the body. It's usually stronger than most people's punches unless you're like some tune off type care. So your shoulders should take to kick around. But when you learn how to kick and you kick, good kick to the body is horrific. It's horrific. I save your shoulders account. You should work on your body. Stop, dedicate your life. All I'm doing, I cannot do the pocket. Dedicate your life to kicking. I think you can afford to pay. Have to fucking, hey, it's not going to kill him.

Speaker 2:          01:28:28       Kill him, kill him. Dude's will only be able to last like 90 seconds tops with Joe. Joe's going to, he kicks hard, dude, he's going to need eight guys at 49 he kicks his heart as anybody have a few months. That's $10,000 you do the kick harder. I've been around kicking for a long time. You kick harder the name. Well, I learned it. I just said I've been around kicking Toronto. Good. That'll feel dated. Do that. If he kicks hard back in the day and I, and I was right next to him. Who I watched boss Rutan. Hi. Come on. Oh my gosh. How did it sound like I sound like somebody shooting a shotgun. Sean's I've ever heard kick a bag, Pedro. Yup. Pedro has those leg kicks. They scared me more than anything I've ever seen in my life to wide his hips I've ever seen.

Speaker 2:          01:29:16       When I saw him kick the bag of Beverly Hills Jujitsu. Oh, all I thought of is, is just would take one and I'd be over. There's no way I would survive if he kicked me once in the leg. My Shit would just give up. Had the hardest cake I've ever seen. Who? Shane Carlin was a gorilla. He, but he never threw every easily is too tempted to throw him. He wasn't tempt to throw them in the fight because they thought to heavy weights get counter. He fucked up so many guys legs in the gym. They banned them from kicking. Oh, how am I gonna stop kicking? Well, that's terrible idea. Why didn't they fucking pay people? The money does go down. Just like car would like, didn't Trevor Whitman train him? Why didn't Trevor have him throwing kicks? Because Trevor's a wicked kicks kicks all the time, but then you want to be stowed in sparring and do it in fights.

Speaker 2:          01:29:59       Man, that's too bad. It's like to a show heavy, like fuck up your ACRM win a fucking freak specimen. As far as like his skeletal muscular structure every day for how many years? I can't even imagine. How would you, I don't know how you get out of the car today. I'm going to sh chat stuck in Denver. Not much to do. Do they got to start wrapping or play basketball or class? Spark car. Would you wear a football helmet or something? I would never Helma wouldn't help. Bigger thing for him to hit. Oh Dude. I was living in boulder and I was training in a mall Easton's and this guy walked in and I was, we were in the middle of the class, right? We're going over drills and I saw this guy walk in. I'm like, that's not even a real person. Can be a real person.

Speaker 2:          01:30:41       Then I realized it was car when he had his tee shirt on that looked like it probably was made for me. Dude, his fucking arms were my thighs essentially. He looks like juggernaut from x men. He was at the time, I mean he wasn't making, he had to make to 65 so it car when he's cutting weight. Yeah. He's caught in a little bit of weight. He was so big. You'll quick me. She takes the hottest MMA, so I a one two biddies on it. The booty is just out of control and all. She's just a nice person. She's sweet by far. The hottest girl. I think she's also just, yeah, she's awesome. There's some fucking pretty decently hot, hotter. Some girl that just started fighting and Bella toward it looks really hot. Really? Yeah. It was pictures of her tiff time. Balmain. I would've kicked her out of bed frame and crackers and kicking me in the face. Roses, roses, hottest shit. Paige vanzants hot. Yeah, I know he pays. Got Her ass whooped like that. I'm like, I'm off that train now. No page. I'm a page fan. Don't get me twisted. I'm a page fit, but still Misha Tate pound for Michelle Waterman is sick. She has married, what the fuck know? Agent's Voice of morality. Oh really? That's all I don't

Speaker 4:          01:32:00       like seeing him around. They get punchline that, well, enjoy this kick then. So Shit, they try everything in their power not to show that. No, they don't. They show that fucker all the time. That's in the loop. Now. You know the loop, that knockout loop to plays to Baba O'reilly, the WHO Song, they put Ryan on the, Oh shit. Of course he does. He, he's a part of it. You fucked up. You fucked up light. Dana's going to listen to this and that shit's going to be marked out. They listen. Holly Holm is a fucking legit champion. He doesn't play favorites that much. He might have a love for Rhonda like as a person, but the bottom line is business. Business is business, and Holly is the fucking champions. And with a spectacular result, you couldn't remove that spectacular because that was the most spectacular result in the history of women's MMA in the UFC, right?

Speaker 4:          01:32:55       100% yes. I saw Holly on a private jet, which is what we're seeing now. Holly's having her first FiveStars trouble, so it was this mother fucker say before the podcast started [inaudible] he got, we're talking about this for me. I sucked you in. Fuck you bro. I can't handle this on my local kitchen. About to go into Ketosis, emotion, emotional cutoff, I think. I think it's really easy. Meet Misha and Holly. I think if if Nisha keys, it took Holly down. If Meesha can't take Holly down, Holly's going to win. She's easily going to precision or she can be shamed if she could take her down. If she could take her down. I don't think, I don't think Holly's Jujitsu is anywhere near me shows and she's going to write her up. Hey, Misha went three rounds. Hit the brakes. Let's not say she's going to do this because we really don't know.

Speaker 4:          01:33:59       I really have a problem when people get that he's going to lie to her. Hey, get her mind her up. I don't really think we should say that. You don't think that's a fair assessment? Just disrespectful. Disagree. This is what I think. I think honestly, I think Misha Tate is a better grappler. I think we should take dominated Sarah McMahon on the ground and flipped her over on her back and held her down, which is a giant accomplishment. Yes. How grappled her out ground around and showed some bad ass striking against Jessica [inaudible] with a Ken strife. I man also is not going to be ridiculous. She's not going to charge. She's not going to be Chin up face first Thompson out. All I'm saying is that I don't think it's disrespectful. I would never be disrespectful. However, no, no, no, no. 10 minutes ago. Hey Dash rectal junk lot for sure. No, the chitlins genes haven't been worked out yet, but those jeans are like fucking yoga pants. They need to be these fibers. The fibers is still tight. I put these on today and I from the broken man, look

Speaker 2:          01:34:57       at how flexible you are from the same pack. I'm getting turned on. I like listen, listen. They come from the same box. These are new. Those are, hold on, let me, yeah, now the, now they're broken. I said no because I still have the tag on them. I don't know about that does look very broken down. I think you're lying. I just got them now. You put them on that machine you bought, you bought it, put them on a gene machine. Just listens. I didn't buy them. They send them to me for free. I don't think it's the greatest strikers ever, ever for women in MMA. MMA you wanna you want to Emj check I signed, I would say Holly, Holly and Holly. Holly and you want to say that to say she would like anybody out for k o power but to say that Hollywood line up, anybody's not disrespectful.

Speaker 2:          01:35:44       It's a compliment to Holly. It's not a dis this till we were saying she's going to light her up. I believe that. And that's not being disrespectful or Meesha might take her to the ground to be able to dominate her from there cause I've taking her down her take down the fences. Awesome. She's never been to, she might not be able to get taken down. She's never been down before. She can, if she, if we should think DFA, I think Misha is going to, uh, if she can take her down, she's going to be all over on the ground. We don't know cause it's really a mystery. Like we haven't seen Holly on the ground except for those brief moments with Rhonda. What she got out of Ron is armbar attempt and where she took Rhonda down. All we know, it's all I know as far as you might have some inside information from gyms for people who trained with her.

Speaker 2:          01:36:26       I'd always seen, I know this, I think it's a tougher matchup stylistic wise for Holly then Rhonda. Well, what do you know? Well, um, I know that uh, she's not obsessed with Jujitsu. She's one of those and there's a lot of MMA fighters like that. I couldn't go, I could just rattle names off left and right. There's a lot of guys, they just want to stand and bang and work. The wrestling. I'll work to get up. They don't want to fucking learn Jiu Jitsu. There's so many. They're still around. They didn't want to work on their back. They just want to beat the shit out of people, take them fucking down and get on top or not even fucking take them down to stay in bang and, and work on their takedown defense. If they get taken down, work on getting back up. That's sad. That tree. That's barbarian. That's Holly.

Speaker 2:          01:37:12       Yeah. That's a lot of guys like that. And I hear Holly is one of those guys. She just wants to stay in the girl girls. She's one of those fighters. And what, what those, uh, fighters all have in common that they're generally not known to have a dangerous weapons off their back and they usually, she gives a fuck up and kitchen kicks bitches in the face, especially in women's divisions do, does she have to worry about, and the women's division, she works on takedown defense a lot and she works on getting back up a lot. That's what I hear. And that then kicking, you can get it through their lesson to be learned that MMA math

Speaker 1:          01:37:56       doesn't really work and it styles really match up. Weird sometimes. And this might be a case like the Misha Tate [inaudible], Holly Holm fight, I think a very tough fight. She's sneaky, she's sneaky and she's tired. She does a lot of good. She's got a lot of good skills. He's got good skills. She's handwriting or two fights with their fucking hands up high. She doesn't rush in and take crazy chances and she can pop. She dropped Jessica. I was super game as fuck. She ain't she, she's crying and she's great in the transition. Really good trend and like, like Holly, she's lost and been beaten up before she got beat up by cats and gone, oh she's been to the mountain. Just came back strong hundred percent that coming back stronger. It's big cause she came back and beat Jessica, I and Sarah McMahon. I thought like showing more determination show like more grit.

Speaker 1:          01:38:39       Like she was her back was against the wall after losing that fight to cat and she came back stronger. Let's see what I've seen from what I've seen with my eye, whether I'm right or not, it just looks like Holly. Holly not only is a higher level striker, I think Holly, just from what I've seen, has much more snap and speed. No question. But you know, it just so many fast. She's a 19 he shows, he shows record is way better than, but Maven, here's the thing. Yeah. But then mainly a striker and not an MMA person. Right. He sang her boxing is unquestionably better. Unquestionably. She's arguably going kicked best striking credentials ever in the history of the women's division. Sure. And kicking time, world boxing champion. The only one who comes close as you want her, cause she's six time world more touch him.

Speaker 1:          01:39:20       Right. When it comes to actual champions. But Meesha can grapple, she can clinch, she can avoid striking and she doesn't necessarily have to kickbox with her. So it becomes a very different proposition. So if they went kickboxing, kickboxing, yes. If they had an MMA kickboxing match, which is where they essentially, the Rhonda fight was except for two brief moments if they went kickboxing. Yeah. Holly's gonna fuck her up, but in MMA me Shit's fucking smart. She's, she's sneaky. She knows a lot of shit and she's been there before and she's tough and she knows she's tough. She knows she can grind it out in a grueling brawl. Yes. And she has a real shot. She's got a real shot. See, I think, I think Misha, she's never going to beat Rhonda, but Meesha can be Holly to be champion. I just think stylistic wise, it's a much better match.

Speaker 1:          01:40:08       The Holly Holly's lateral movement, we won't know a lot, but I know in mixed martial arts, I think stylistic was Misha has a way better chance beating Holly and then she does Ron. Yeah. Also there's a big difference between someone who is fighting off the back leg as a counter person, which Holly is just ridiculously good at her counters. Her timing was fucking spectacular, but Rhonda was presenting a predictable target. There was a lot of ride forward. There was a lot of aggression. It's, I'll show, you know Holly had to do so all hog it had to do was be patient, find the right foot work and catch her coming in cause she knew she was coming in. So it was an exercise and moving back in countering, she knew exactly what she was preparing for me. She's not going to do that. He'll remember. But if you remember like there was a a fighters like

Speaker 2:          01:40:54       most notably Patrick Otay that fought Anderson Silva and he didn't lead and when he didn't lead, Anderson did not look nearly as good. Horrible. He's a horrible fight because cat [inaudible] has an iron jaw, he's got knockout power and he's smart. So what does he do? He knows that Anderson is a wizard at countering, so he's not his predictable, usual aggressive. So I don't think those two girls on the same level is no, they're not on the same level. Holly is Holly's on a very high level Shaman for women. When I was at a higher level striking did an under hook and trying to find out what's the right, this is what we're going to find. What surprised me. I think Holly, I think Holly is so much stronger. I was amazed at how she looked and so much stronger than Rhonda, Rhonda strongest Shit. And it felt like Hollywood does fight.

Speaker 2:          01:41:40       Ain't got his phone around by the way. And she's gonna be stronger than me despite out of the first early phase. Xiao Casey's house looked like Doodoo. They Lee. Well, he's had some rough fights, man. Patrick Cummings really beat him down last round. That was in Brazil. That was a crazy fight, man. Oh, sees a motherfucker. He's in the first round and he's a super athlete man. And that powerful left kick sick. He's got a nasty left kick. He's a dude that just keeps getting better too. If you can get him down, if he can get him down, you can win the III trial for the NFL a bunch of times. Nope. I thought he did. Nope, he just played that, uh, you know, she had Tennessee and then went straight to, uh, he didn't, he didn't, uh, he's a serious athlete, ma'am. Maybe you went to combine or something, but yeah, not the NFL combine, but he really, no, he didn't get tryouts with the NFL when he knocked out shogun step away.

Speaker 2:          01:42:28       Left Hook. He was nasty. He let everybody know what's up. I'll do. It was a big message Jamie. While they're doing shogun. No shogun. It is. Yes. Yes, yes. Who's Liotta fighting Leona's fighters don't understand him. Nothing. That's a weird fucking for nothing on both of those. How dare you. Thanks for nothing. You wouldn't watch that. Nah. 10 years ago I would. Okay. I will absolutely watch Leo's crunk always crunk crunk photo oto fight. Cause the Oto just uh, a year and a half ago knocked out Mark Munoz with that wicked left head kick. Leo was one of my favorite people on the planet. I'm just saying and sold. Can we give them something else? Well, Dan Henderson has a bunch of fights left and his contract and I think he still thinks that he can do it. And uh, you got to let it go like that. He deserves the right. Yeah. Two unsuccessful attempts to professional football. So there it goes. You were right. Brian doesn't say NFL though, does it? Well, I would imagine on football. No, not at [inaudible] Italian. You can be CFL. AFL, really peripheral ton. Brendan Schaub, former NFL player with fucking logic. Maybe you should listen. I know for 20 years who got hurt? He kicked him and he fucked his leg up. He kicked him fucked up. Where did he kick him? I need to see him again so he can't get his legs fucked up leg,

Speaker 1:          01:43:52       but he's limping. He might hurt his knee. His training camp. His team. I have no clue. I have no idea who he's trading in his leg. His left leg is real wobbly man, man. She changed. When you went to South Park, did you see what happened at the April? This is auctioned off. Did you see what happened to me? He kicked a homeboy and hurt his leg. Kicking him. Oh, like Shinny Shin. Something happened like this back to ou stuck it again. He's not moving. I saw that was the wrong leg. He's not moving at face. Y'All just to the right leg. You're talking about the left leg and he switched us. He started out in south Pandosy. Switch cause is fucked up so he's kicking with the fucked up leg is is supporting line the leg. His right leg is super fucked up. Punched. Oh that's weird.

Speaker 1:          01:44:35       Yeah, he got his knee messed up. Isn't it weird just to try to see a guy tried to hide that shit. You know what was the best I've ever seen at it? You're right. Hall. Uriah hall had his foot fucked up so bad that it's toe was hanging off and he came back to his corner and you can see we've got a camera on it so we could get a look at it. His foot was completely fucked up like his toe. The bone was sticking out of his toe. Jon Jones, Jon Jones, that was after the fight. That was after it was over your Riaa. What I'm saying is he went back to his corner, like barely could walk and then when the round started that motherfucker completely ignored it. He was throwing kicks with it. It's fucking toe was hanging off and he's throwing wheel kicks with it.

Speaker 1:          01:45:16       Yeah. There's this total like you see how fucked up it is. It was broken off to the right and the bone was coming out. Like I could see the worst air shows. Uriah hall is a bad motherfucker. He is a bad motherfucker. He hasn't fun awhile, Huh? Well he lost a gay guard member. Beat gay guard. Then he lost two. I'm sorry dude. We lost her being very, very careful here. Huh? The fight we gay guard was spectacular victory for him. 1:00 AM I getting gate guard still ranked higher than them. That's crazy. That doesn't make any sense. Fells ladies. Right, right. Yeah. Tail slate. This and I haven't seen, and this is another one who fought very smart against Anderson Silva. He's another one that went five rounds where they're swinging, so I'm like, oh, you had him. Wow. You had him look at that look.

Speaker 1:          01:46:04       Oh Shit. It looks like he can throw some elbows from the guard and open. Same. Who's on top right now with a phage? His guard. He's got good left elbow with the card. One thing about a guy like phaseout though is it Fazio was a really good striker and really good strikers are hard to ground and pound cause they don't panic. They don't lock up, relax. They get used to getting hit. They know how to roll with things and they know what's coming. You know like their Iq as far as like striking like where the right hand's common, where the left hand is coming, what position you're in to put like real torque behind something. You rarely catch some clean like look out, see how clever he's moving when he's off his shit. Fight Anderson back in the day on and off. No he fought king mo and knocked him out and strike force to win the title. He's a bad motherfucker. Yeah but you know phase

Speaker 2:          01:46:49       Xiao. Is that a tough stint? Yeah, he's had some ups and downs. He might've took, he might've gotten the UFC like a little later in his career. You know, it'd be a little late for like him at his best effort. Should they be massaging has near right now. Do something. No, I don't know what's wrong with it. I mean, it's Ashley, could it have been a charley horse? We know that Sasha is, fuck, I push. It depended upon he's putting a skin patch. Might hurt his foot. I feel like this a bad idea. Put ice before you go out there. Yeah. Might be praying the inflammation down.

Speaker 2:          01:47:25       Oh, he might've broke his foot when he threw that leg kicks. He's, you know, he might've blew his knee out or blue. His foot out or something. Yeah. Damn man, that's too bad. Yeah. Yeah. He's having a hard time on it. See how it's kind of wobbly. Kind of get that win. But it's just interesting. You know, like little variations in someone's gait. You could see it. Oh, look at them. This is why I think I'm so excited about what's going on right now with MMA, with guys working on this crazy footwork like the Duane Ludwig like camp with the Tj Dillashaw style foot work, Dominick Cruz's footwork, Conor Mcgregor's footwork, emotion coach show all this coaches. Yeah, tape. She texted me the day goes, hey man, you have any movement coach in La? I text back. Fuck you.

Speaker 2:          01:48:15       I don't deal with that bullshit. Fuck fuck you started laughing. Do that is so funny. If you an MMA fan, you understand why that will. That is so funny because I'm guilty of it as much as anybody, but I can't shut the fuck up about moving balls deep in it balls deep. I had the move game guy. Can we keep that guy who made coach? He was great. Oh, what's your uh, background? Uh, as a kid I climbed on trees and played with rock. Oh, mark tick. Oh yeah. What's your degree? I played with Legos as a kid. Yeah. It would've been nice if he had to like a more like ready as zero. And I think he knows a lot. I mean real about it. I think he knows a lot about proprioception and some of the things he was talking about, about balance and coordination. Look like in Carlos fight. Listen man, he's always wanting to, you won that fight anyways, but I don't think he moved to, well I think he's only been working with them for a short amount of time and you know as much as I do that new things you're going to incorporate into like high level cage fighting. It takes a long time to really apply. That's not climb on logs. Maybe go to the gym and grapple.

Speaker 2:          01:49:26       I had a ponytail I'll look like just someone on the underground said that some stealing their line. They all looked like Jesus. Why don't ponytails whoever it is that did that. A tweet me so I can, there you go. What's your background Dan? He went, Nah man. I just like typed on rocks as a kid, climbed some trees. As soon as I heard mom turn this shit

Speaker 4:          01:49:48       off, why was, I was confused still even at the end like how the, how they sort of design their protocol. I mean what, what, how he designs like what they're going to do that day out of my first son. It was such bullshit, Connors, move on. Do you want? Okay. For everyone else stayed the fucking the gym and work on your sports. This if you haven't done it. I honestly belay man, unless you've done it, you wouldn't have like, okay, here's a perfect example. You're doing yoga now. Would you not fit? That shit was for housewives before you ever did it. Nah Son. I liked that shit.

Speaker 4:          01:50:26       Go to yoga to be like, listen, I'm going to beat Andre or last night. Let me go get some hot. Yo Listen, I'm not talking about why you as an experienced yoga person goes to yoga. I'm talking about your prejudice against Yoga. Before you ever did yoga, what was it? I didn't happen. I did. I'm open minded bull shit. I swear. How dare you fucking green some aligned. Show us or show us your roots. You didn't think it turned out to be way easier, way harder. Well, you didn't think your perception of it was there. It was way easier than it actually was. Hey baby is way harder. Harder, but in the middle of training camp, I'm like, thank God for Mrs. Downs in this yoga. Otherwise I wouldn't move. Is good, but there's a lot of movement in training, right? I mean jabbing your chuck full of movements that don't they have a lot of yoga movements and movements.

Speaker 4:          01:51:23       Yes. Yeah. There's definitely a lot of movement, a lot of payrolls and you to see a degree and he sees some sort of scientific, hold on a second there because there's people that don't get degrees. Like how about, how about the a a natural that Hixon Gracie tributes to a lot of its flexibility and movement like before these movement coaches. Okay. This is what people that need to understand. Back in the fucking early nineties Hickson was like a guy. You didn't want it. He was like candy man. Yeah. He didn't want to say his name three times.

Speaker 4:          01:51:53       It's true. He did. He was the motherfucker. Motherfuckers is heartbeat down, all that stuff. He was a Yogi. He's a legit Yogi and gymnastic natural. Exactly. It was both. He come, he applied, he applied fire broth. That's why he's alleging also then he did 40 years of Jujitsu it out from all the graces he stood out. Hixon Gracie. All of them would cause he did the movie. This is backwards. That's a, maybe it's the maybe had something to do with that. Yeah, but here what you're saying here too. Yes. It's not, they're not mutually exclusive. Exclusive Hex and the reason why he was the greatest ever it was because he was the perfect storm. He was the guy who was super smart. He was super tough. He was a war. He had a warrior mentality and he was intelligent enough to apply a bunch of really unconventional training modalities like some serious yoga, that fucking video of him on the bars and Santa Monica, but before he fought in Japan Valley Tudos, he's doing balance beam shit.

Speaker 4:          01:53:00       Go into a full split standing there on his fucking bar on the beach. He's doing all these real, this is, I'm not saying the movement doesn't work. It was both. It was I. Hell you say it doesn't help that he's been doing anyway. Positive Jim. I'm saying it was an MMA fighter in the UFC on my list of priorities to become a UFC champion. Hiring a movement coach who his background is climbing on rocks and climbing trees. I'm going to fuck it. I can't say it about this foretell guy he had. Now he's a god. That diary don't diss him cause I'll come out. Fuck you ain't gotta give you say only know side kick the fuck out. Don't know what his total or one the core can do. But I know he has the respect of Carlos condit so he's got my respect and I enjoy talking to them and I think he knows a lot.

Speaker 4:          01:53:47       So I disagree with you on that. But I don't know if he can do what that Edo Portel God can do. But we're talking about mindset moves like, yeah, I agree. It seems like it's not real Joe. All I'm saying is if you're going to dedicate your time to something, I don't know if that's the way to go. Here's why. I'm not sure you're right guys like Richard Martinez, we brought this up before you. He a a fantastic breakdancer and the ability to manipulate his body, standing on one hand, doing the fucking full lotus, all the crazy shit that he could do directly translated to him almost immediately being a bad mother fucker in Jujitsu directly. Ridiculously. Um, and not just athletic, but the dexterity of one language informs the other man. You're wrong. Jansen's movement wasn't wild, but this is movement. This is why I'm saying you're wrong. It's all good if it works. And how sign up for salsa classes. Dan, don't you remember what football players were taking? Balance? Yes, I did. It did you sell side. But why did it take ballet or something to do to get this ham hock and he's tied to check this out. Ladies. Wear Yoga Pants.

Speaker 4:          01:55:11       Shoes. Listen to [inaudible] valley for two years. You gotta you have time to do all these things. They enter school. Why are you not 90 theater schools? Shit, you've done for five years. I lived in the woods. Mushrooms. How big acting school. You have to take ballet acting school. You must take ballet and you have to perform. Fuck you. Okay. That's like going to painting school and learning how to like play video games but not related and the tasting right now, and I'm being dead serious. I was a beautiful dancer. I'm barefoot

Speaker 1:          01:55:44       ballet ballet's to do that video, that video you did was just hilarious of uh, not unconventional dancer. What was the name of it? Um, what the fuck was that video that you did that where I was at [inaudible]? No, you had this crazy dance video that you made. I can't remember. It. Dammit. It was hilarious. She said, oh, just did this thing. Take a look at it. And I remember I took it home with back when people that actually had DVDs. Yes, it is Brian Dancing. It wasn't unconventional cancer. It's not called word unconventional. Like in know fuck on Orthodox dancer. No, no, no, no, no inappropriate dances. I think it was great. It was a sketch that he, it was ridiculous. It was ridiculous as a guy just like, it's okay to dance on a dance floor. A great right. We all agree. Give me, as long as you step into this arena and you're on the heart, it's all to get ridiculous, but you can't do that shit when you're waiting in line to rent a car.

Speaker 1:          01:56:34       Brian said, sounds great. Thanks. I can't remember. Remember, I just remember there was some inappropriate dancing when I slapped the gambler. I slap that Bob thing and I would jump out and that sounds hilarious. I did all kinds of weird stuff like that. We were doing ballet and then about two days into it, so it was like we should probably go catch him flip balls. Yeah, no shit, no shit. And that's where all this movement dancing stuff. Why don't you think lunges are essentially in a lot of ways, especially dumbbell lunges are very much a movement exercise cause it's all about balance and rigidity and keeping your core straight. They're like, there's something about like double Dumbbell lunges, things along those lines that they were you, they help you go balls as it was no heavy stuff. Like, yeah, like if you're going to apply like an explosive movement to a martial art, there's no doubt about lifting weights.

Speaker 1:          01:57:24       Helps. Right? No doubt about it. No doubt about it. Like lifting weights. If there was no weight restrictions, you can do whatever you wanted and lift as much weight as you want it. There's a big difference from one 70 and 200 you mean there's a big difference. You get like way stronger if you get way more explosive, you get, it's beneficial in a applied situation. Right? Agreed. That's movement. Yeah. It's not much different. It's like you're talking about movement with weights or movement with Moitai like people. There's a lot of people that say training boy ties helped a Jujitsu. I believe it. It doesn't make sense, but just kind of shit. You have to do all this motions you have to do in Moy Tai. That's movement too. I would also say timings with gymnastics.

Speaker 1:          01:58:06       What leads, what leads one person, like what with Hixon would lead him into the other disciplines is that mindset that that comprehensive minded mindset constantly get better. This foundation is so fucking good insane, but also he was a student of the Great Japanese Samurai. Yes. Their philosophy. So I'm sure he read the book of five rings and one of the things about the book of five rings in and emphasize was like taking in all sorts of different, be soft, like taking calligraphy, do painting because the flexible and the reason for that, if you look at any great innovator, they started with one discipline, they started with one discipline and then they, when they studied other disciplines, they were able to appropriate those disciplines and come up with a new style. They really will revolutionize a new style by studying that style. You branch out a young Hixon might be, might be Alan Jobe in a young, oh yeah, Hanson is shot.

Speaker 1:          01:58:58       Good shot. So he's from the long goal essentially. He's, you know, from South America twist head plus to have a real problem. The real problem with that Pussy Hickson was getting, oh my God, please bring him up. I like to look at his, he's getting supermodels. Let's, let's look again. Let's like, let's not bring up specific instance. I think your a Jujitsu helps your music and I think your music helps you Jujitsu. And I think as your Jujitsu has gotten better, you music's gotten better and as your music's gotten better, your Jujitsu, Scott, I think it'd be a coach. I think they're all too, cause you'd be red hot too. When you get great at things like especially like you specifically, you're a guy who like one of the best things about you creating 10th plaids judges ever since I've known you, like if you have an idea in your mind, like there's a point you have to get to like okay there's a spot over there you've got to get.

Speaker 1:          01:59:53       So you have this crazy tunnel vision. Well you'll figure out unconventional paths to get to a point. Like you, you can block out a lot of like external shit that a lot of other people don't. You know, they can't block out the can't fat. They can't like tune in to the finish line the way you can. It's really interesting to see because I think that applies to your music as well. I think it applies to everything you do. And I think it comes for a lot of us. I think it comes from like some fucked up place where you didn't get enough when you were a child and then you detention or what? Anything. Love, attention, praise, [inaudible] ship, Camaraderie. Also, what's really important is like I said this to him the other day, I go, dude, you know, he says, don't spar. You know why it's parked is it terrifies me now I'm not good as far as you turn this in to you and I was talking to, I'm trying to explain to him.

Speaker 1:          02:00:38       No, no. What I'm saying is that you listen, listen, listen, son of no, this is the point I'm making. Listen, when you do something that you're afraid of or that puts you on, makes you uncomfortable. I end up writing I think. I think like when you do another discipline that maybe you're not even good at, that scares you. It'll open up channels in your original discipline. It will jumble your brain so you come at things in a different way. If you stay comfortable in and stuff, you're, you're most likely, if you're going to create a field, it's harder to branch out and become more creative. If you do things you're not that good at that maybe you're scared of. They churn that. That caused you to stretch in other areas, and this is the, this is the argument for movement coaches. When you do things you're not that good.

Speaker 1:          02:01:18       I had to put you in an in your, in your step out of your comfort zone. You'll probably get better at your original, better be good at everything else. We'll probably hire a movement coach. That's true. That's true. Being Open minded. I think four of us should get a timeshare fucking gay where just four dudes. I don't know. Let's do it. Christ, this podcast every day. Listen, after all of our checks get sick about bullshit. Let's just get a fat house in the hills and the movement coach every day. We have a big house with four branches where you know, we don't have to necessarily hear each other. We just meet in the kitchen. You know what I'm saying? And just live like men don't live like these bitches that we've become trapped in this world. This world of this is when we get to be free. We could be free like this all the time. Yeah.

Speaker 6:          02:02:02       Oh,

Speaker 1:          02:02:03       gives it at the end of Braveheart.

Speaker 6:          02:02:05       Oh, that's

Speaker 1:          02:02:06       what I'm saying. Open. Say Pew, Pew, Pew with a broke foot whips and the actual injury was p baby. I just a sprain. He looks like the rocking. Okay. Yeah, it looks like he's walking. Okay. It's a tough line on this. And Susan Silva, what do you think is, I forgot this. Shaye Anderson. Um, it's a very good fight at this time and both of their careers, it becomes interesting, whereas like Anderson, when he was dominating, when he was like, like right after he smashed jail son in, in the second fight, you would think like, Whoa, that's a, that's a tough fight for Bisping. The Andersons just in the matrix. But Anderson comes off of, you know, like psychologically there's two v brutal losses in a row. One a loss for sure. What a catastrophic injury. Then he just fell off. Yeah. And then he gets by Nick Diaz, but he gets humiliated.

Speaker 1:          02:02:54       Like Nick Diaz lies on his back and puts his hands on his head and mocks him. He's talking to him. He's calling him a bitch. Dude. Nick Diaz was super respectful right up until the moment they got in that cage. And then he was Nick Diaz. Yes. It was all gone. He's never fucking, it's like that old fable about the Scorpion and the frog. The frog wants to get across the pond and the Scorpion says, or the Scorpion wants get across the frog, the pond and the frog, uh, is in the water and his corporate says, let me ride on your back. And uh, the frog says, I won't do that if I do that, you'll sting me. He goes, well, if I did that, we would both die. I'm not stupid. So the Scorpion rides on the frog's back and halfway across the water, he stings him and the frogs like what the fuck? And the Scorpion is like, sorry. It's in my nature. Yeah. Damn dog. What kind of childhood stories that you haven't heard? The famous story. They also use it. They'll use it. They'll see is in connection with that 20 stings. Him and a guy. What's that?

Speaker 1:          02:03:50       I don't know the score. That's a great, that's a great allegory. Well, the Blue Red Riding Hood, once upon a time that your children in the words and you legitimately had to worry about them get eaten by wolves. Yeah. Moral these motherfucking and story is this. It's vegans are retarded. That's, that's the story of these motherfuckers [inaudible] everywhere because stay the fuck out of the woods. Stay out of the woods. The words, there's a fucking wolf. Yes. And then don't trust strangers actually. Yeah. Well also number Numero Uno mentally for sure, because the person inside the house and pretended to be his grandmother, but the reason why they were always wolves where there's little red riding hood of three little pigs. It was always wolves. Wolves legitimately ate a lot of fucking people and people seem to have forgot about that. Now we're all these assholes. We need to bring back the wolf.

Speaker 1:          02:04:38       We need to make sure the Walter like wolves will kill everyone. You know, they don't eat a lot of, they eat some of what they killed. Oh my God, wolves are so prey driven that they will kill whole herds of elk and not eat half the meat. I'll slap the fuck doing about German German fairytales like Hansel and Gretel. What happens? A lady and old lady takes him and she's a witch. She puts them in a cage and starts feeding them too. What? Plump them up so she can eat them more or less stories don't trust even old ladies. Germans are like, you're a stranger. Sorry. Also, let's be honest about like a long time ago, a thousand years ago in rural areas where food was scarce and people had suffered through a lifetime, you weren't going to survive the winter and chaos and seeing murders and seeing assault and rape and constant, just the programming of person.

Speaker 1:          02:05:34       How much cannibalism was going on back then? A lot according to Steven Rinella, like in this country. I mean Steve, we were talking about the other day with the native Americans and Nez Perce. Steve or Noah has the best native American stories. He's like, he does, he's a legit scholar almost. I mean, I don't think he would call himself that, but he's incredibly knowledgeable on American history and like what the Nez Perce Indians did in the, in the, in the, like the Great Lakes area. They would eat a lot of cannibalism, man, a lot and filed the teeth down. That was a crazy guy, right in the history of the missionaries. There's a lot of documented evidence. What that all was like, yeah, we got this from an Indian. They were cannibals. We have to kill them all because there are cannibals won't, by the way, any problem might be honest.

Speaker 1:          02:06:19       Sometimes stories. The ETJ they're going to eat. We love that. All the native Americans, the hippies, they were human beings. Just like all of us. Like all of us weren't any more noble. They were no more noble than anybody else. They were good people and bad people. They were just as violent as, hey, the most violent people arguably could be, could be white people. Like what the Germans did. It didn't. White people, man. Well, I think also like when you're dealing with people in the Great Lake States, the lights and fucking wipe it. That's a horrific knockout mice, the Roy Nelson Minataro knockout. But um, you know those people were living in a horrible, horrible climate like the, the Great Lakes before the invention of heat and it must have been so fun. Yeah. Yeah. I mean people got desperado like, you know, we know about the Donner Party in Colorado. They get trapped in the mountains.

Speaker 1:          02:07:05       They had to eat each other. That shit probably happened all the time. And the Great Lakes, they just didn't talk about it. You're talking about 15 below zero recently, right? I wonder what part you eat first. The legs just go right to the asshole. That's the worst part first for you. I take the chest, I hit your chest. Say Listen, worst case scenario meeting someone's asshole. I'm a scoop it out with a sharp, that's the last thing. You Ain't a file a spoon with a, with a fucking, I'm not even going to pass on the shit. You don't even want to like the shit you have to hold on to, you know, I need to eat their shit. I would eat their bowls in there. Dick. You know, why take first testosterone? Because that's what the raccoons and the squirrels go after first. There's a reason. Think about that.

Speaker 1:          02:07:43       Now the ball, that's how wolves determine who's the alpha. The alpha gets to eat the liver. That's why there was a, yeah, there was a guy who did a, a a whole, um, this whole, like he's a documentary where he lived with wolves and he, he lived amongst them and he had to fake it. Kill. He would have a kill there and he would pack a liver inside of it and he would pull the liver out. He didn't in front of them and he had to eat it in front of them and then we let them eat. But he's like, no, no, no, no. This fucking van. It's terrifying. Yeah, it's fucking terrifying. Cause then here's, here's the thing, what happened? He had a farm nearby that was having problems with wolves and he, this guy was a wolf scientist. And so he would uh, go there with these big gigantic speakers that play wolf sounds.

Speaker 1:          02:08:26       Cause he had a scare off this one pack of wolves with a new pack of wolves that invade us instead of make it, he had to make it scary enough. So these worlds backed off. It's all on video. The scary thing is when the Alpha, when there's a thing, he came back, the guy came back after a month and the, there was a new wolf had taken over and so the new wolf wanted to kill him. So he had a whimper. She had a whimper in front of this wall. So he was recognized as the, the old alpha and to avoid being killed, which is standard. It's normal. Like a wolf would challenge and they would fight to the death and the new alpha would kill the or try to kill the old alpha. He came back close to die because he was in his face growl.

Speaker 1:          02:09:04       Human involved in all that fucking shit. The off the wall. Oh yeah. Oh yeah. There's a whole documentary on it. It's called living with wolves. I think. Here's the thing about it, man, they don't understand that he's an unusual, because they'd been with him since he was, they were a baby. See the whole, I go the way that works. He didn't just walk in. It's a gigantic wildlife preserve and this guy lives in the wildlife preserve these Wolfe's. Yes. He knows for their whole life. So they've been with him since he was, you know, like four or five years ago. But they're fucking grown. Dangerous has wolves now. Shit. It's amazing. You have to find it. Jamie isn't home living with wolves. I've met. It's probably on that. I watched him with wolves. I think I rushed it. Some guy came in and said, check this out. I'm on a fixed, his wolf problem.

Speaker 1:          02:09:55       Opry mentioned to me some dude who was living with the grizzly bears. Oh yeah. That's crazy, man. He died, got fucked up by the bears. So they ate them. One of the best, uh, like, uh, what am I confusing? Grizzly man. Best best documentaries ever. It's a Werner Herzog documentary, unintentional. Coming up talking about that guy. Oh, there's another guy that lives it bears. Yeah, man. He was like the real aggressive today and then the thing he ate his asshole that like the next day. Well there was one bear that they used on a movie. They used the like some football. I'm talking about bark the Brit. Yeah, that guy on 12th legs. Yeah. No shit reason. No Shit. The guy was just standing there doing like they were doing some sort of drill together and the bear just decided terrorists throw to pull it off. Course Beers are going to bear shit.

Speaker 1:          02:10:42       I of course agree with you. What did you think was, so I talked to a trainer. I talked to this training with Perez. He said, well, bears a worn yet about three minutes before they're, if they're having a bad day, you got to step up and go. What do they do? They good day. He goes, they start clicking their jaw Wunderbar starts winning. Grizzlies starts clicking his jaws time. If you just stop training, alright. And he's trans big cats. They will warn you. What is this? Is this the same guy? Dude? Those are wild. None on this isn't the same Guy Jamie. Now, this isn't the scientists. The scientists was a younger guy. Well, this is another guy. Just does the same. Yeah. I think that guys living with wild wolves, that guys, yeah, Werner Herzog, Werner Herzog. It's like chills with them. No, it's not. Werner Herzog, Werner Herzog's grids, grizzly man, this guy's name is Werner fruit or something like that. Um, it was a different guy and uh, it was a really pretty positive. It was a younger guy. Oh Shit. I'm going to get all into this now, man. It's amazing. It's amazing. You know what? I, they have a really sophisticated social system. I don't know why.

Speaker 3:          02:11:42       You know what I paid her into lately? Big Time. Like I said. Yeah, they do. Anyway, keep calling quite by making a murderer and all that. I still haven't seen it yet. I'm a rebel bro. Shit's me. I'll fucking walk wolves and bears balls. Deep Harden with that man. I'm obsessed with wildlife. Absolutely fucking obsessed. I'm obsessed. I'm obsessed with rolling Netflix documentary about the India and the Ganges River. No, what's it called, dude? It's called like wild and India, but it's on Netflix. Wild Ganges River. Why was insane. Very dirty. It comes from no, listen, it's not that they're, this is the crazy part about it is all that that river comes from the Himalayas, all the ice and the glaciers or something like that on Netflix about India, but the part about the Ganges River, it's a magical fucking river. They sh they put debt, they burn dead bodies in there.

Speaker 3:          02:12:38       They throw trash, sewage, everything. But there's something they did. It's called the wildest. Wildest. Yes. Yes. There's something about that. Water has so much mineral, it's a composition that it, it's like an antibacterial water. It kills all the bacteria and the pathogens. They've, according to this documentary that could be full of shit on Netflix. It's print. They're saying that it's so, there's so much sewage goes into there, but it cleanses itself. You can still drink it. You can be down in the river. People still drink, cause my friend was a jumped in and had an earache for two years. Okay. [inaudible] white crime. Right.

Speaker 1:          02:13:23       A bit about the sooner bands going to be fast. It sounded bands is no joke. I remember that. I used to have Eddie about the guy who's the, they got killed in a boat. There was a boat. There was food diet with the Tigers. Yeah. They swam out to the boat and killed these guys individually one by one and dragged him back to the shore. The tiger swam out to the boat. I remember that you told me that this documentary we talked about that they couldn't. That's the only spot on the world and where tigers actively hunt human. They love the taste of humans. Slobber off while they say, is that apple? Had you ever go to India? Oh, I ain't gone, but they got great documentaries about it. Yeah, I'll watch that show. They've killed literally hundreds of thousands of people over the last hundred years. Over the last hundred years. Tigers.

Speaker 1:          02:14:05       Yeah. They have some, some nutty number. Let's not the best way to go over the last 200 years. I think the number's like 300,000 I quoted the number like honestly and realistically in my comedy special that was talking, talking monkey's in space. They fucking killed the killed this guy dragged him to shore and then jump back in the water killed another guy, dragged them in, short, jumped back in the water, killed another guy, the frown. They couldn't swim away. These things are so fast, they can swim faster than five guys can row a boat at full speeds there anything. He's a great book. Great book called the managers have, come on, read the medics, tie Jason, Jason, dude, the crocodiles. Don't fuck with them. Crocodiles and fuck with Rochelle to run it from Roy Nelson like he was a tiger. Right? Well, Roy Nelson is a dangerous dude. Nelson throws fucking hammers. You want to talk about a guy who was always been known as a Jujitsu? He thought it was fucking fired. Eddie and I knew Roy Nelson back when he was just big country. Everybody called him big country and he's a Jujitsu guy.

Speaker 1:          02:15:06       Oh that fucking haymaker the mark layman days. Yeah. Are these guys are going to get a Versace had contract. He should. Well, if Versace was fucking smart, I they would try to get it on their chubby man dollars for real. Is that Denmark? Why? Why? Why does everybody have to be beautiful? Roy Nelson in a fucking fat suit with a cigar in his hand, sick and this man haters. What's on my arm hanging out this and people love that guy. I really believe absolutely 100% that he's like under marketed by a lot of companies. Like companies should scoop that guy up. Schlitz Schlitz malt liquor. She not even as a joke like that, but just like he's a man. First of all, fucking man. He has the most knockout bonuses in UFC history for heavyweight. Yeah. He's a fucking man. It's in the animal. It's an animal. We get real shot. He has a grown man running from him. Yeah, I mean this motherfucker throws hammers. Do you remember when he knocked out Mitre on Jesus Christ? Dude cameras. He knocked out Nogueira like he was a fucking paper cutout. Is he the hardest guy that's ever hit you?

Speaker 7:          02:16:17       Yes.

Speaker 1:          02:16:19       Jesus Christ. He was hot. Damn. Like Rochelle Rochelle, Rochelle can take it. He's like, fuck you bitch. Rochelle was about to get knocked down. The grow shock isn't wrestler. Yeah. Was One

Speaker 2:          02:16:30       mistake. Okay. National Champ, heavyweight heavyweight match jam. It's similar as sumo wrestling. He can be shitty about it. It really is really, really until Brock Lesnar's in your division brought, that was 20 years ago now, but the whites that, what's the difference between now and then like a Brock Lesnar was around today. Is He rebelling? There's no proxies out there and I don't know what's the exact college wrestling? I watched the finals freak. He's a silver, a blonde silver back. Is it evolution? Are we seeing the last of the Viking DNA? Cause he is a regular sized wife. Guys are growing straight. Emo Now. Yeah, probably he has a regular size wife. I'm sure his children would be fucking gigantic. But while Amy was a pro wrestler, right, she was a, he's wife. She was a, she was stable. She was saying was sable and Jude was fucking fine.

Speaker 2:          02:17:23       Beautiful. He did well. He did well for himself. [inaudible] to jack off to middle school. How dare you say that? No, it's a good thing you don't do shit. You fake fighting. Oh, how dare you. It's true too. Boy, if you met him in an alley, he's like one of the worst people you could run into it for him. He would rate me a brief exchange. Let's be real. He raped me and I have to do something. I have to jump on his back. Don't pry. I'd have to pull them aside and say, listen, his kids are going to be freaks. Kids will probably stole it from us. So when his kids grow to be about 18 years old, we'll start getting nervous again, but until there's no price out, she's beautiful. I'm looking at, well, who is that dude that just fought that kickboxer dude.

Speaker 2:          02:18:09       Um, uh, black gentlemen from an, from, was it from Africa in the UFC? Yeah. You're talking about the dude from France. From France. That's right. He was like a shittier looking check. Congo dreads. Asti power. Yes. To power. Sure. Take him down. Yeah. Well he got taken down the first round. Who was that? What was tray Bree sable though was the hotness? I haven't, I haven't talked about her forever. Sable. Okay. If you can get like Gabby Garcia and Shane car went to have a kid cause lawdy Miss Kalata. What would we have? What will we have? Shane Carwyn and Gabby Garcia. Oh Shit. Oh Shit. You got a woman who's six foot four. You periscoping you fuck no. Was he doing periscope is no idea. Shane car went and Gabby Garcia have a baby. You think that's the ultimate super athletes, bro. Fuck that shit. No, no. Shane Carwyn and Serena Williams. Oh, you're right. You're right. In a racial as well. Yes. Yeah, yeah. There's just a lot of emotional power to both sides combining together in one furious in that kid to the lettuces. Just send it to the loan only. Don't make him rich and happy. You send them just, they might not make it out of there though. Nah, they'll figure it out. I don't know. That's a rescue

Speaker 2:          02:19:30       you have to make more than one. Do we get on this book is your baby has this ridiculous, what was that movie? The guy who was born with a deformity. You're talking about the launch with share. We share. That's mask

Speaker 1:          02:19:50       fair guy. The Bear Guy Meets Sulu the bear man. Oh, okay. It's a new bear guy and his face got ripped off too. Did he get killed? Oh boy. Do you know Jamie are yet? You guessing they kind of deserve it though? Yeah. Find out if he got killed. So it looks like the bearing number B watermelon, Huh? Well, here's the thing about bears, man. Bears can be a lot like dogs if they're like really taken care of. If you feed them and loved them, like people have lived with bears where they like swim with bears, would you gotta be with them for the time they were a baby? They can never be, never be feral. And you, you gotta be able to raise them and give them love. So they, they sort of have to identify with you. They have to give a precise date, but the imprint on you, but they're like a dog.

Speaker 1:          02:20:32       And a lot of ways, I agree with you, it's always a risk because you're dealing with something that like one generation removed was completely wild. Like you could easily have a grizzly bear where you are. You're the mother. Grizzly bear had a fight for its life against a mountain lion that was trying to kill this baby. You know, that's totally possible. And then here it is, like one generation later you got the pop and it's living in your house. Tell you write this cup. I'd rather chill with those grizzly bears than the sum of those chimpanzees and Shit in my house. That's good. Call chimpanzees might decide to fuck you.

Speaker 2:          02:21:06       These are beers. Just gonna rip my throat out. Fucking shit wants to bust that. None of my ass. He's going to do it. You know, it's on the verge of suicide. If you want to commit suicide, then that might be a good idea. You know what? Since you're going to kill herself, why not go fucking live with lions saying that he, you know what I mean? See what happens. And then if they kill you, whatever you were going to kill yourself. Anyways. Guy In South Africa lives at 21 lions and wrestles getting of mine as well. Turn out great. Yeah, that works out. Are you suicidal? Call this number now guys. Guys to do is we'll do whatever they can to separate themselves from the pack to scientists that are like, they want to gain data that like you gotta you gotta be suicidal to go into those motherfucking dens. Did Rochelle Catch Roy? Is that what you meant when he fell he slept. I slept. I'm surprised and I try and do that all the time and I get embarrassed when I like I'll go, oh, and some won't land and I'm my own professional. Like I'm at the fights calling the fight and someone throws a head kick and it doesn't land, but it like, looks like it's going to land

Speaker 1:          02:22:07       last minute. It gets to, I'm like, oh my God, but it's genuine. I swear to God

Speaker 2:          02:22:11       folks got to slip when I talking to when I yell out. Like I don't, I don't do that accidentally.

Speaker 1:          02:22:17       I mean, I don't do that. Uh, artificially. This looks like it

Speaker 2:          02:22:21       guys look like they're completely related. Yeah, definitely.

Speaker 4:          02:22:28       Same species, exact same speech. This isn't confusing at all. You know, good thing he has a beard because I wouldn't remember. I wouldn't. I'd be like, Huh? I remember when Keith Hackney fought a manual. Yarbrough, you'll do whatever you like. Okay, what's going on here? These things, these things are so not similar in their size. These two individuals that both it, he's doing no show. We'll show it looks like a supermodel version of the mask. Right? [inaudible] sacred here. How is that talking shit? I said you look like a supermom from the sheer shoes is my favorite show. Yes. Yes.

Speaker 4:          02:23:18       Devin. Eddie, look, look, that's terrible. That's probably the [inaudible] per bottle is better. I'm going a joke and say that I'm doing my, like I said, you better say something, man. You're joking. Social Berg, it's going to cost Roy Nelson this fight. The Karma of your joke is so it's a compliment. It might've caught over Wales. Here's a trivia question. Who is the accurate? He's a real dude. Come on, man. That's not makeup. That's a real dance. No, I thought that was a no, no, no. It's Eric Stoltz. No, no, that's Eric Stoltz. Yeah, sure. Got Derek Brennan. How bad that make you feel? I was like, oh no, no. I knew it was never installed. Here's a, here's a little Jiu Jitsu trivia powder. Remember that dude, Sean Patrick Jujitsu. Legit blackout under Shawn Williams. Yeah, Sean Williams. Henzel Gracie black belt after powder. Well, here's the deal. The Guy who, the guy who directed powder was a guy who is like, there was some controversy about some alleged child molestation charges, which made powder or really weird movie was powder was kind of like, uh, like a nambla love story to a lot of people.

Speaker 4:          02:24:40       There was a hole about like that guy he got in trouble. The guy who direct like not, it wasn't a little thing like he got in like real criminal trouble. I do not remember we shit. I do not remember the specifics I'm going to watch. I don't think there is, but there's no fight out. Jamie flipping here. Hold on a sec. Here we go. Barry Crimmins was when the talking about it, I believe they're on the case of Netflix. Barry Crimmins, was he talking about that? He was talking about AOL. Barry Crimmins was talking about AOL, how child molesters were selling things to AOL, but Barry Crimmins did comment about that guy on a, was it on a podcast? Was It on Twitter? I thought that's how I heard about it. Maybe you might be right. You might be right. I had known about it before that I'd read a are there was a big article

Speaker 2:          02:25:24       that was about it, I want to say like two years ago, but uh, yeah. Barry, of course, if you don't know Barry Crimmins is, he's a Boston comedy legend and he had a Bobcat Goldthwait documentary called call me lucky and it's about his, he'd getting molested when he was a kid. It's horrific, man. He was two years old. He was four years old and it's babysitters. Boyfriend would fuck him. God Damn. Why didn't you bring the podcast? Dude? You got to see it. I'm fine to me. Call me Lucky's and amazing dot. Here's the guy. Look at this. Victor Salvo loves terrorizing. Semi-Naked use. That's a scary, no shit. [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          02:26:03       that's from 2012 from vice. Take her shirt off. Ready? What do you mean terrorizing bottoms on tops off. Exactly. Take a pair of pants up. Move around. I might kick you. I don't know. I might Damn Royce go for the shake. Kill now. Three for three year before it was cool. He's a hipster for a take down. Did not get it. Roy Roy's wrestling's underrated Liquidia to Barnett that he has a loss on his record. That I think is one of the most unfair standups I lost against our Lawsky side control working on a Kamora. He has a full double wrist lock. He has the double Russell. He doesn't have the lock right cause he has to get it locked. Turned behind the back on a song guy. It's a Camorra's an interesting move because Marcello Garcia doesn't like to do it because he thinks it's a strong man move.

Speaker 2:          02:26:53       He doesn't, he doesn't incorporate it. He's all about chokes. He's all about whatever he does has to work on everybody. When we wrote that, nothing wrong with that at all. Weird way to, there's a he, he, you know, he doesn't believe in any kind of chokes with our men like triangles or Darcy has happened is that guy, but I understand. I understand. Really, totally understand that a a shit. If he only focus you take that time. Everybody has the same amount of time to drill. Everyone has the same time. Everyone has 24 hours in a day. Everyone has a life. Everyone did that. Everyone has the same on the fucking time. Generally, what are you going to do with that block every day when you break it all down, what are you going to do with that block? If you say, why don't you save all that time for shit that works on the big guys?

Speaker 2:          02:27:40       If it works on the big guys, it's going to work on the small guys, so let's just work on that. There's nothing wrong with that at motherfucking all. That's really it. That's genius. Me Personally, I like working on everything that works on guys that have like 15 pounds on you. You know what I mean? Because you're going to be rolling out a lot with guys that are your uh, your size and maybe as long as it works on guys that have a little weight on you, I'm into those most. To me that's a legit move. If that works on a guy that's around your size at a high level, I want that in my character actually just talking about that. He would work on chokes. He said Tokes always work, whereas other stuff, but there's a difference between, there's a difference between a arm in chokes, like Darcy is Japanese like tires arm and give teens and then straight net trucks like Marcella teens and all these weird little fucking things like Rothwell on, on Barnett.

Speaker 2:          02:28:32       There's all these Ninja chokes and shit. There's about 23 motherfucking ways to squeeze the neck to make a motherfucker tat, you know what I mean? So all those take special time to get good at. Just because you're good at one of the 23 makes it has nothing to do with are you good at this one or are you going to that one? You got to spend the same amount of time on that shit. It might give you a little boost. If you're really good this one then you'll really, you'll get really good at this one quicker than a guy who's not good at that one. But generally you've got to spend time and all these chokes to master any, let me ask this for, I forget who was that. There was one choke that I saw only once in the UFC. It was a choke like Gogo Plata by a kid who was a tiger showmen student.

Speaker 2:          02:29:18       Nick Nick something or another it the UFC. Yes. He had some crazy choke and he said that he invented it while it was going on. He's like, I'm venting it in the fight. Um, I have no idea what that is. Do you know what I'm talking about? I know what I'm talking about but I don't remember. I couldn't show you. I showed him techniques all the Goddamn time. None of my shit. I should have videotaped that cause that shit gone take new shit. Nick Pace. Yes. He did some crazy. See if you can find a submission because there was some weird legs and Michigan Trump, I can show you. Well I remember it was something to zoo with a Shin across the neck by the guests. It was a joke. It was some weird choke that had to do with some weird like Alma Plata type set up and he wound up in some position with his Shin underneath this guy's choke and underneath this guy's neck in an unconventional way that I don't necessarily remember.

Speaker 2:          02:30:14       I'd have to see it again. But I remember saying if you done that before and he said that was the first time he did it, ever did it. Is there, is there a huge difference between guys? Crazy. Is there a huge difference? Really good guys now and 10 years ago. Oh, Jujitsu wise, like all different techniques. That's like saying is there a difference in standup comedy now in general as in the 80s come on in the 80s of his co there's really got them right. You know what I mean? Same Day, same look up behind you. That's the choke nick pace going to show us to it. Why is it looks so crappy, Jamie? See you look at this. He grabs it like this. He throws the leg over the neck, shoots under like this and he grabs his ankle gun show control. That's called gun, but he chokes him from here.

Speaker 2:          02:30:59       Yup. Yup. I got a guy, Ben Eddy who does this ship. So all the time Dan came up with this on the fly in the UFC dam and um, how many, you know, he calls it the pace choke. I don't, I hair is great. I do want to do that. Eve Joe's cow. Now check out. He always has really legit whose style is based off. That said it looks nice, but I'm going to show control. Spend a lot of times. That's a, that's an atomic green. Those guys taught Tiger Schulman for a lot of children. Those guys were

Speaker 1:          02:31:34       giant karate chain in um, the east coast in New York all the time. Like you both vehicles. They didn't think of him as legit, like necessarily because they thought, well, most giant karate schools aren't legit. Yeah. However, they are legit. Me Think Uriah Hall, this fucking kid, nick pace came from there. I'm that guy who won last, Frankie Rivera, the guy who won last week against a Uri Alcantara. He's from there. Jimmy Rivera. James Rivera. There's a lot of fucking really high level guys from Tiger Shellmans. Tiger shot with Uriah Hall is look, his kickboxers standup is ridiculous. It gets karate skills. Fucking ridiculous that that spinning back kick to the face that he called gay guard with. He's nasty. That's all tiger showmen man. It's amazing. And this nick paste kid, it's like they were one of the few like big name schools. That was a whole chain that became like a real legit gym. That's cool. Karate chain number one karate chain. Maybe there's others that did it. I'm sure there are. But Tiger shellmans was a straight dominant karate chain and when they saw the unfold, they were like, okay, we adopt, we need some of that. We need someone that's a tiger. Schellman is uh, openminded modern.

Speaker 2:          02:32:51       Another way to look at it. Do you want me to look at as you have it that big of school and they're always going to be some superstars who are going to come through. No, no, no. It's, their training is really good. It's not just that would most other marsh martial arts, most of the traditional martial arts associations didn't evolve. Tiger shellmans was all about evolution. Most, most Roy one traditional martial arts associations are not into evolving because the people at the top, they're fucking lazy and cause they would have to learn all this new shit. You don't want to do it. Who does this? Who gets on top of a top rope, pulls his shirt up and rubs his, the homer Simpson tough after a decision. Steep Amy. Oh, choose the bay. Got that new girl. Hey, easy dude. Got, damn it. It's the wine. He's a handsome guy. I got Steve Bay is a very handsome man. [inaudible] minutes on Allen Gabon. And you're going to talk about Steve as a handsome, handsome. Let's be honest. And this is, uh, this is one of the least heavy fight companions ever after. We've barely pay attention as I tried to play bigger than does this the gayest one? Never Brian's here. It gets somewhat, I can't help it. The dream about your boyfriend can hear that it was that the only job? He's the only one so

Speaker 1:          02:34:18       far. The only dream. I can't wait for Connor dos. Anjos what do you think God is bigger than dos? Anjos how about that? How about percents? What's up with that? They say that. Oh, he didn't. No we didn't. Okay. Cause that's what it says time. I have a hard time. I think he, what he said was, I have a hard time seeing Connor win this fight. I'm paraphrasing. He's like, he's being honest. He's being honored. It's called honey. What did I say? It's called honey. Listen man. You cannot neglect the skills of dos. Anjos yeah, it's a tough fight. I, when I look at dose on Joe's, I look at a fucking beast, man. The way he put away Benson Henderson, the way he put away Donaldson Roney the way he beat the fuck out of Sergio Pettis or excuse me, Anthony Pettis. He's something special, man. Dude, I can't think of a worst matchup for comment, but comments.

Speaker 1:          02:35:06       We've talked to colors. He thinks that it's a legit, he goes, ah, he's just like Josie Aldo, but shittier version. Do you think he's really trying to start his own promotion? Do you think that's legit? That's, that's bullshit. Get restless real. I think so. Here's the power. He's actually saying, did he actually say he's going to start its own promotion? Listen, man, if I was Conor Mcgregor, why would I work for the UFC? After awhile I would go, I'm just going to do the Conor McGregor show. Take that shit in the road with all the best comments. Real, real. I wouldn't guys know. I don't know. I would imagine if Conor McGregor has a contract that would allow him at a certain time to no longer be with the UFC, he could do whatever the fuck he can take the spar with him, but here's the question. Why would he, why would, there you go.

Speaker 1:          02:35:50       It's those last two fights on that main event. Ghost him. What would you say that command Nunez is? No girl. Let's not talk about that right now. Let's let's what? What I'm saying about Connor is that Connor is a fucking legit superstar, but the UFC made him a superstar. Like the UFC is the perfect vehicle. They've got everything down. The promotion, the management, the way it's all set up. The way the fuck the marketing is on point. It's on another level. If you go to some other organization, good luck running a smooth ship. What happened to affliction? What happened to elite x, Z, what happened and strife for bottom line. The bottom line is Grier calm. Conor McGregor would be unknown to the world and Ireland training in a boxing gym. If it wasn't for the u s 100% of remember that she ever sent, he's got the UFC made him famous.

Speaker 1:          02:36:39       Oh, green [inaudible] deserves the money. It was a cooperative venture. There's no either or. They're not mutually exclusive in their, their, their amount of success. That was dependent upon their actions. They both benefit from no, no, but no. Make no mistake about it. The UFC, would it always be big? Yes, but always be big. If there was never a Connor, the UFC would be just as been, but never as big as with a guy like that. If you want to be as big as what that guy is, you need econom McGregor. So the only way it happened, no doubt about it. Or Rodney? Always. Always. Yeah. I've always been fascinated with Connor. Maybe GSP today, maybe GSP today.

Speaker 2:          02:37:16       Why would he says I think the UFC today is bigger than it's ever been. I think she has a young GSP today. If he was a champion, goddammit, girls would be there. They're fucking damp panties would be filling up 100,000 seat arenas. Yeah, he's a stud. He's CSP was in his prime, like when he was like when he beat Bj Penn for defending his title when he was in his prime. If Bj, if the UFC was, I think the UFC is probably, I mean I don't know how many more people watch it now than then, but as far as like being well known, it's way more well known. I agree way more. What about Bj Penn coming back? What the fuck? Amazing. That's crazy. Right? Part of me. He went to fucking Greg Jackson. God, he thought about it. He's sitting there and fucking on Hilo chill on the volcanoes outside the fucking window.

Speaker 2:          02:38:06       He thought about it and he knew it. He came back. What did he fucking do? He goes to Greg Jackson. I mean, he did the best fucking thing possible. I mean, he could have went to Aka can. I went to trial. Tracy has a fight attention, but he decided to go to the one of the top fucking schools. But Jackson is not a bad goddamn choice. The best choice. Well, it's one of like five best choices. Eric Holt, Delfi Arrow down in the lions. That's a best choice you've got for Rasa Hobby, who is probably my first choice, or one of them would be my number one him or least her bowling as a striking coach. You mean everything coach or a mastermind mastermind though I think. I think that working number one mighty mouse is coach, so you're right. I'm mad human. For us, a hobby to me are commensurate.

Speaker 2:          02:38:56       I think they're exactly the same level. They're both wizards. I was talking about those guys. They're masters. Matt Hume had more MMA fights I think for us. Had some, a lot of kickboxing fights. But for us it's like nasty on the ground and he's a super genius when it comes to like his analytical mind, the way it breaks down fights. He breaks down street fights cause youtube videos where he breaks down. Yeah, it breaks down how this guy came out of guy and he got cracked. This guy with a left hook and he explains the footwork, draws it in a diagram. He's also a young smart as fuck. He's younger and he's been through it. Like he came up with everyone. It was the coolest fucking thing he did. He just put out a video or he's testing guard work and ground and pound on guards.

Speaker 2:          02:39:35       What guard works best for granted. He did this shit. He put it on Youtube, he put it up. So he had him, him, Gary Tilden and I think Gordon Ryan, they had like some dude jumped with, with boxing gloves, jump in the Gar and start pounding them. And, uh, and in the video, the guys on the bottom, whether it was for Gary telling him or I think it was Gordon, I don't fucking know that third guy was, uh, but they were just wrecking the guy on top of leg locks. Uh, a bunch of different things. It was like a revolutionary experimentation. Uh, one of the smartest things you could ever do.

Speaker 3:          02:40:14       The only thing I think version two, he needs to, I think we should add, uh, there's different scenarios and ground and pound, it's not always, it's not always the same ground and pound. Sometimes the guys on top, he doesn't want even be on the ground. So if you're not holding him on the ground, he's going to stand up and back out. You have to have that, that scenario to what happens. And that's what God is best for. A guy that's on top. And your guard, you must have pulled guard because he didn't try to take you down. He wants to stay on to sleep. So as soon as you open your guard, he's going to back out and he's gone. So what guard is best for that scenario? And there's another scenario also, you have the scenario where the guy is getting beat. Your opponent is getting beat up on his feet. So he's taking you down at will and you have to deal with the guy who's trying not to let you stand up. So I think a version two of those ground and pound experimentation to figure out what's the best guard. I think that's my 2 cents. But what the fuck do I know? I don't know. But the fact that for Ross actually did that it he's already experimenting on what is the best guard for ground and pound. That's brilliant. I love it

Speaker 1:          02:41:25       for m and an MMA that says Nma, he makes his UFC debut, but I could've sworn and he's trying to bet on this main event. Son. I'm trying to, I'm trying to, uh, you want to break down the garden? You make a good point, Eddie. And you know one another good point. Ryan Callahan talked about for Breeshia over dooms guard and he was like none of our ground and pound worked on them with King Mo, who's a nasty wrestler king most like world class. We need more of those films that we need honestly on a consistent basis. Here's the thing though, Eddie, I think there's only like five guys who can do that. I mean that's one of, that's how high in regard I hold for us to hobby ridiculous. He's just a real martial arts wizard. Super Smart Guy. You're talked to him and have conversations with them.

Speaker 1:          02:42:13       Tell me what that slide. It's a, he honestly set the blueprint for everyone in Denver. Like Shane Carwyn, myself, Nate Marquardt in the blueprint for GSP. He had them do an all this different stuff. A lot of genius. Like what kind of Shit? Like walking on logs. No. Does he know that shit playing when I was a kid, you know, aligning with rocks. A lot of the drilling a lot. He would have George drill a ton more than we would drill instead of just sparring. No drilling a on the pads and shit to movement started. Worst case scenario where we weren't doing that, he's a legit genius. I think that's one of the biggest mistakes that people make is too much sparring. Even in Jujitsu, I was talking to a buddy of mine who's a purple belt about this and he's like, he hurt his hip and he had to get a hip replacement surgery and uh, you know, he's like rh, he's like in his late forties and he, and he's a very successful businessman and he went from there to going back to training again.

Speaker 1:          02:43:07       But once he healed up, he's doing like drills and he's like, man, I'm telling you, you just from doing all these drills, my Jujitsu has gotten much, much better because now he's constantly, constantly improving upon his data patterns pattern. Yes. Yes. Really the only pattern chunking you were talking about Henner like a good Henner Gracie is like pattern chunking this whole life. He just understands that way. Pal boxing the patterns and mixing them all up and it shows taekwondo. So get John Hendricks body, he looks fit now. Johnny Annex beat Tyron Woodley. What do you say? NCAA. How's he look? Johnny Hendricks looks amazing. It looks slim, right? Yes. He doesn't look a at all like he hadn't any sort of a weight problem is underweight this morning. Or when they weighed in, he was underweight the morning. That's the French guy. This motherfucker, Woo. What's his name? Francis spins make that larger and go, no, no man.

Speaker 1:          02:44:00       He's a beast. He's got some serious power. Yeah. And a good defense on the ground too. When he got taken down, the dude didn't do shit to them. You may be friends, but he's west African sir. Oh, for Shoah. He's gigantic to stop doing that. And I was, I was interviewed. I'm like, hi, can I interview over here? Like he, I went to interview him and he decided he wanted to walk away and go, uh, see how the guys feeling after he beat the fuck out of him. Come like, I'm okay. I'll just be over here. You do your thing buddy. What a man. He fucked that dude up. I don't know who the fuck you. Fuck. I got a tiny time. I don't know if the guy had fought and I felt like the look at Joe Silva book where he comes up to these guys.

Speaker 1:          02:44:42       Oh my Lord. But he holds their faith. Listen, he holds there. Joe Silva, he's a great guy. Just needs mushrooms in a fucking reality check by shrubs. Are you reality check Brendan? I think an ass whooping. I'm kind of saying, oh, how dare you. It was an I like Joe Silva. I have never had any ill dealings with Joe Sova. He is my friend. I enjoy him as a human being. I do not know what the fuck went down with you and Joe Silva, me, any fighter. You bitches need to work that shit out on your own bad. No, I'm good. Now. Up In another dimension. You decide to come back and get a fucking do it and you got to come back one more time. You're going to make a comeback. What camp do you join and what is your strategy? It's hard to turn down muscle farm with least her bowling right now, but I'd probably go tristar.

Speaker 1:          02:45:32       I like muscle farm for a couple of reasons. One. It's a big new facility. Everything's super state of the art and it's got some momentum. A lot of dudes are gravitating towards their leaster Elliot Marshall, you know, Duane Ludwig is in cahoots. You know, there's a lot of other really good striking coaches. You've got Brandon Thatch, you've got his click way to there now and the way it's happening, it's happening right? The guy who's running it now, he's a student of mine and he, he always wanted to, uh, he was very successful in the supplement industry, very, very successful and his passion was to build an

Speaker 4:          02:46:10       MMA two years ago, years ago. Here you go. Here we go. We got involved. We had a fight with Danny Sanchez and quite who ate it was the craziest part of her plan. Drinks, Hendricks and Thompson is about to start and we got to pay attention to this shit. This should support first of all, Hendricks. You're right. Any predictions? Hendricks was fantastic. I don't know how if one of always got to solve that wrestling, but he never looked like that. He looks so fit. He's got to solve that wrestling. Well, he fucked up in the Tyron Woodley fight. He didn't make weight. Look at this fucking side stance. Stance show unusual. So epic, and here's the thing about Stephen Thompson is that he's been training a lot. Wrestling has gotten a lot better and he's not worried about being taken down. He'll get taken down by Johnny Brian Hall. He might get taken down, but they might not with the right hand caught Ncaa Chana.

Speaker 4:          02:47:00       It's hard to deal with it. You're right. It is hard to deal with. You know what else had to deal with 57 and o and kickboxing. It's super hard to deal with. Dude, see, I tried to Johnny's wrestling. I tried hard Johnny's wrestling. So tough watching it. Let's just watch it. We were, I know what the fuck is going to happen. Talk. You might be right, but you're, you're, you're saying what's definitely going to happen while it's happening. That seems really ridiculous. Same probability. The rest. That's how I sound. I sound like a wizard. I'm a little psychic dude. I see things. I see things. Exactly. One second before that happened. This is the worst kind of commentary everyone was saying. Imagine if we did commentary like this sale. Worse going to have different shit is happening. Yeah, you got no dick tell he's not even taking them down to tempted him right now. Cool. Countering countering counter counter. A lot like mine, like mine. [inaudible]

Speaker 4:          02:47:56       to the face to telling you. There's very few guys that could avoid the take down like him and have these kinds of skills. It's a completely different kind of leg dexterity. Nasty dude. He used to fight in that Chuck Norris. Oh, Johnny Hendricks is in a world. He's getting lit up. He's getting lit up like Thomas Tryna do some shit that Hendricks has not seen before. It's hard to get a sprite. It's hard to get a sparring partner. I'm going to find a guy like him now. He is one of the elites in American kickboxing freak. Look at him, man. He fights like a snake. Oh sure. To deal with so much taller, tall. It's not looking so much taller. It depends on who you're looking for. If you look at for Thompson, it's looking excellent. Yeah. It's looking great. Hundreds is isn't a bad situation. Just trying to throw that kick and he's getting caught.

Speaker 4:          02:48:48       He's getting timed. He's in a terrible situation. He says, Rhonda Rousey Hall. Look at the switch, kick jumping, switch, kick jumps with the left and kicks with the right, right hand on the chin. God Dog to lighten them up and no, no relented. How tough is Johnny Hendricks? Doesn't even look like he's getting hurt. He just keeps coming forward. Look, one wonder boy comes out to do this to everybody. How about that? I've said that for a long time. I think he beats Robbie Lawler. I'll call it now. He's learning how to fucking fight MMA the same at the same level that he learned to be this elite kickboxer. Did I wash them in that Chuck Norris thing? Remember the World Combat League with graphite and that bowl? He was honest, tough. He thought I was a fan of that. Chuck Norris kickbox. He was the champion guys. Hey. Oh my God. It's one of the best guys in it. Johnny's covering. Well, damn, I didn't know that. Caught with two zero zero crushing the head. He's talking to him saying, Oh God, God, God, God, title shot saying it. Oh, look at this. He can't even walk. Oh no, he's doing the karate kid who he's married to. We try to kid.

Speaker 4:          02:50:16       Oh my God. He double got me. Thought it was her. Oh Shit Dude. He fuck. Fuck it. Hey, condom crown. Here's his movement. His karate, he has minimal footwork. Movement is just like doing all those movements. Drills with karate and you see the way he does hips. I guarantee McGregor. We'll never say the 70 pound belt. This is looking good to me. I'll never say that. You don't want to fight this guy being precision. Oh Man. Appreciation though. The precision knew it. Bam, Bam, Bam or Johnny Man, this the difference in the giant. He nodded at him, look at it. It's no. He nods at them. He's like, Yup, you got blue dude. He got lit up or take him down. He couldn't get taken. This is the former champion who's gone through the best camp of his life. He's in the best shape he's ever been. He comes in, they're motivated and he gets torn apart.

Speaker 4:          02:51:17       Title shot apart by a gene has to be a title shot. We were witnessing this, those separately. Fuck of evolution. First of us, I'm a cheetah, but we needed another one. We needed another one. Machida was like, okay, it's a special one. It's still not karate now we see it for sure. The way, listen guys, this is one round. You can do Woodley in him for the fucking title. Hip Robbie Lawler. A little bit of a break man through a war with Carlos candidate karate. Karate is are those toxin Tom Lawler come on. So on. Wouldn't you want to see him? I think that's what I'm saying. It's hard to take Woodley's title shot away. It's very hard. Yossi roles. I do, but I'm saying six in a row in a sense of fairness.

Speaker 1:          02:52:06       If we want to get a sense of fairness, it's a very difficult, he's going to out strike everybody, but how would you, how much would you like to see him versus Damien?

Speaker 4:          02:52:12       My, Oh, he's going to strike everybody. I'd like to see him fight. Can't take him down. I wonder if he kicks Damien. My conduit would be fine.

Speaker 1:          02:52:28       No, I've been predicting the rise, the Wonderboy for awhile. Karate had won that fight. That's all one bad fight. We, he's over two years ago he was overtrained against Matt Brown Brown and since then he's been dominant and getting better every time. And he was smart. He's a one second that he goes and trains the 185 pound champion is one of the grittiest fucking wrestlers in the game. He goes for Weidman's camp. Weidman's a bigger guy and he learns how to survive. Well, people, a lot of people don't know Stephen Wonderboy Thompson got his start from GSP. GSP was fighting. Carlos condit brought, want to bully in, I don't know how they met, brought him in and then uh, he sent him to Denver to train with Nate, myself, all the guys. And he was just fucking everybody up. Meanwhile, how about this speed? This guy, one of the most marketable guys ever. The nicest guy. So like legitimately the nicest friendliest guy you'd ever want to meet. Clean cut doesn't look like some murder. I hope you have your book shot here. Like, look at him. He's going to thank God. Thank God.

Speaker 8:          02:53:32       Hmm.

Speaker 4:          02:53:35       Jesus Christ. His kid's good. He's religious or something. This guy came up to you, had a club and said, I used to fucking a bad ass strike. I'm going to stop. I'm going to go to church and get better at fighting.

Speaker 8:          02:53:46       We're trying to get into the cage. He's his hands to set it up for the take down.

Speaker 4:          02:53:50       This guy's a fucking listen patiently. That front leg side kick, dude. You see the extension fuck routes like mine? Yeah. Well be better if it wasn't lefthand Colby like yours. You shut the fuck up. He's a sniper or how fucking sniper. Look at that. Right uppercut. No one's ever be Johnny Hendricks like that too. Not like that. Look at that. Right kick to the body on the way out, Johnny. So fucking tough though. He's so, oh Jesus will. Come on, man. You got to give it up. He's a genius. He's amazing. Amazing. Hashtag Callen called it. That's the course. I called it too. I got my fucking barbell jeans on. I will fight. You were a genius tonight. Every climb. I was tired and I woke up. He was writing was on fire tonight. Yeah. You said he's a genius. He was right. We only have five minutes left. Oh, we did. We tell you why he put everybody on notice badly or these things timed. It was a first friends here that's here. Johnny. Johnny's a man. Let me here.

Speaker 1:          02:55:03       Turn

Speaker 7:          02:55:04       this out. We go over to my hair. It wasn't any panelist off of him very well, so that was something he did burn. Well man, hats off. He was the better man.

Speaker 1:          02:55:19       That's a man right there.

Speaker 7:          02:55:23       You didn't eat the old Morgan. I was going to say, besides, you did an awesome job.

Speaker 1:          02:55:27       [inaudible]. You know what, man? That's fine because that just shows his character. Johnny, Johnny. Johnny Hendricks is a man. Awesome. If he's a man, he's the best. He's the nicest guy on Fiverr. You had to find a fucking monster who strikes has been striking since he was three years old. Sign up. Nobody's fine. What is fighting right now? He's fighting a wonder. Boys figured out how to stay standing. Yeah. He's figured out how to do it in where he's gotten so comfortable with it. They can get loose. That was the total level higher than everybody else's. How you, this is how you'd be dramatic when you say is watch this. No. Hey, did you know what he was fighting the future and that's all you gotta say it brother. Yeah, but no one's going to give you that amount of time. The format. Why the pause for people.

Speaker 1:          02:56:14       Everyone dreamed of jumping back and shit. You don't have that type of that. I can't pause. I can't pause. How does a wolf den son turned out? I know are talking about fucking all these like details and these guys, I've never heard of it and I was like, ah, I can't find it. Oh, I was trying to keep an opening for wine. I was trying to give you prompts of your wine, but I was, I was kicking when you told me and talked about that. I mean, you know, you're just sabotage us are off the charts. Not Bad. Right? You're not mad. Oh, your wind skills are off the charts. You know as much about wine is my business manager who's got a fucking wine cellar in is high. I pay attention to those dudes. Really? I'll sit in a wine or a wine store and talked to the guy for hours.

Speaker 1:          02:56:54       I, yeah, my wife has just dragged me out. I'll call my friend Matt. I'll call him from like anywhere. I'll be like, all right dude, I'm in some cabernets right now. I'm gonna read you some shit. Yeah, this is the expensive shoes. This isn't any good. Just just tell me which of the good one. And he'll go, oh, that's a good one. [inaudible] 97 95 is a better year, but 97 is not bad to go to counseling. One tool has good one. Who? Dude from tool. Oh fuck yeah. Got good one. He definitely does. As far as if you ever had Mainers wine, it's delicious. Who's Maynard Maynard Keenan purple belt in Jujitsu, by the way, from tool. He was the one I was talking about before when I was talking about my friend who injured his hip. I just didn't want to namedrop. Oh. And he's a, he owns could do.

Speaker 1:          02:57:33       So it's really good. He does everything. If he does anything, he does it well. He does it a black belt level. Yeah. You know, you'd sooner a tool. He makes fucking fantastic back on the mat. Wow. Drilling. He's, you know, he's my age. Great music. Yes. He's a beast. Like an intellectual. A, he's a, he's a, he's a no bullshit kind of a guy. And he called me up because I had that a primal guy on Mark Sisson and uh, he got a lot of things right. But apparently when he was talking wine, uh, Maynard was like, Eh, stay in your lane son. Yeah. He's like, we don't use 87 different chemicals. He's like, you guys, we need to use some natural shit. Like yeast. Yeah. Maybe. And you know, maybe some tannins. Fine. A lot of times, Remarkably Sam, it was Christ Wonderboy is good. Good God. He's a snake. Madness. Not to be a dick. I'm just saying this from since 1986 remember back in the day way he moves to welterweight in the world. In the first round.

Speaker 1:          02:58:36       He crushed them in the first round. Two that we might be looking at the champion right there. We really must have been saying what Robbie Lawler's Goddamn ferocious. That mother fucker knocked out knocked dot Melvin malleable matchup for Robbie. You might be right, but Johnny Hodges to the worst matchup you might be right. But there are, I believe there's a difference in the amount of danger that Robbie Lawler we'll put himself in versus the amount of danger that Johnny [inaudible]. Boy, I'm just saying the amount of danger he'll put himself in trying to hit him. Robbie Lawler would take some crazy ass fucking chances and do some explosive, ridiculously aggressive shit. Luck. Even as a champion, he might not land it, but dude, he knocked Melvin man who have dead. It's crazy. He's so indestructable we're man Hook was 10 off on you. You treat them like a reaction, like a geode just kicking his leg.

Speaker 1:          02:59:26       His leg looked like it was like a like on a, on a string like war. And then he just talked to his head. I'll give Wonderboy the title shot. Well I believe so. I believe so, but I, I, I think the Tyron Woodley still has a real good argument that he deserves the title shot even though he's not as impressive as this guy because his last fight he won by injury. You know, Carlos condit kicked fucked up as me. He was, he was winning that fight though. He definitely wanted the first graph. That's a tough argument, especially as far as mark and bill saying that he was supposed to be fighting Johny Hendricks number one title shot. Johnny Hendricks had to pull out because he didn't make weight and essentially Tyron was promised the title shot. You know how the PFC rose thing? I don't think it's a bad thing if Wonderboy weights out and knock somebody else off because I'm telling you my performance like this, a performance like this is like some superstar emerging shit.

Speaker 1:          03:00:15       Dude. He looked like a genius tonight. A striking genius. Look at that spinning back kick to the arm. Like it's like getting hit by a fucking bat in your arms. He's kicking him in the arms. Johnny Hendricks was like, what the fuck? Getting hit by a machine. Oh my God, everything he's doing is perfect example. This is a direct example of what we were talking about when we were going over the technique of the kick. He throws everything, he slides into it, he turns his hip over, he turns his hip over and he throws punches. He's laser beam accurate man, like he's on a wire and sees what you're doing before you do it right. See all you're going to throw it, write it, and let me just, let me just move a little bit back. But by the way, he landed that right kick to the body. They're white kick to the body and that exchange before it was extraordinary

Speaker 3:          03:01:00       because he's, he knows he's on the way out, but he also knows where Hendricks left arm is and he sneaks that right kick right under it as he was sliding backwards, which very few people are going to be able to do crazy. You know the crazy guy took my fighting more. So what you do in martial arts, you, like I said before, we all have a certain amount of time to drill, so whatever. What ever the cold food, the karate guys, whatever they were doing during the dark ages when we thought it didn't work, whatever they were doing, they were getting really good at it, at that range and getting fucking the best at that range. Maybe they can get taken down easily. Maybe though they don't know any Jujitsu. But now we gotten to the point where they spent all that time in that range and now they added in supplement a wrestling so they can stay in that range. The range that they rule, the range that they spent all their time and the range that nobody else spent that much time on that ranch. But they got the wrestling and the surroundings, they can stay in that range that they rule in during the dark ages when everyone thought that didn't work, but hey, guess what? Now we're the fucking works. Cause I got all that shit.

Speaker 4:          03:02:05       I love heavy. We just saw karate when he talks. He talks. He's like, dude, we have to end this podcast on that. Cause we have mark, we're at the three hour mark. We, we did we go over yet? But yeah, we have swapped, slightly went over three hours. So most of this has gone good. I'd everybody good long, big kiss. Eddie, you're grabbing me ramble. No, you're great. Could you go when it gets dark.
