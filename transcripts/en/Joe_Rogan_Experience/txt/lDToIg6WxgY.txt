Speaker 1:          00:00          The joe rogan experience. I just didn't even think that was going to be a big deal. I just think that's comics. I think that I'm used to sitting around with those guys at the cellar, you know, it's, it's how we communicate. Like I can't tell you where half of these guys who were my best friends grew up, but I, I'm ready with so many insults for them. If one of the mocks back wearing a stupid jacket, I can't wait, can't wait. Norton is awesome. God, Oh, Norton has crushed me so many times. Talked about this funny story. He had a slice of pizza and Louis Ck som on the street and just slapped a slice of pizza to the ground

Speaker 2:          00:45          just for no reason. And he starts to laugh and when he's telling the story and he's like, oh, I was a juicy pizza pizza too. It was a nice one. You can do that to another person that they wouldn't appreciate it. The humor in the

Speaker 1:          01:00          appropriateness. So happy. The other night we were just playing Keith Robinson. When he got eliminated from star search, we were playing it over and over again in front of him. By the way, don't, don't think that you can come to Amy Schumer and slap her fucking pizza down. That's not what we're saying. You have to be a comedian. You can get a friend, a good friend, but that's so fun. Oftentimes the best Atell. Did you see a special road work? It's so funny. It's like you can get it, but it's still happy that he's doing well again. His show looks dope. He's fucking hilarious. Hilarious. I don't think there is a funniest guy alive, but he's one of my favorites, that's for sure. I was saying at the table with my just saying rounds of venture female comics and we were like eating dessert. It was like a really like sad moment. He just walks up. We're like, hey Dave. He's like, oh, what are you guys having? No boyfriend, Allah mode,

Speaker 2:          01:56          a vet like Tiramisu. Satis oh, that's so funny.

Speaker 1:          02:03          No boyfriend. Like, hey Dave. He didn't even see us till he turned and then just boom, fired out as a cat guy

Speaker 2:          02:12          right off the cuff. Boom. You just had tell him what Tom tell story without Kimbo slice Kimbo slice him ultimate fighter when you were guys were doing that, they don't even show this on the air. So this guy, I'm not gonna mention his name on the show, he lost and you can drink all that alcohol you want in the house and there's only at the time there's only four of us left still fighting Roy Marcus Jones, Mitch reone and uh, myself. That's the four fighting, right? So one of you guys, one of the other guys is hammered, hammered. He's lost, right. Hammered, wasted. All of a sudden this guy gets super racist in the house and there's a whole bunch of black guys in the house. Start, stop. Mountain House wife loves him because the Iroquois nation and starts throwing up racial slurs and throwing up these, you know, the hit, hey, Hitler's Heil Hitler started his name on this piece of paper for me.

Speaker 2:          03:02          All right dude. Dude, this isn't getting out though, right? I just need it, need to know for my own edification. So he starts doing all this stuff. I'm sleeping. I've the biggest fight of my life. The next day, Dana white literally stops us in the car and goes, listen, if whoever makes to the finale where we win or not, you're gonna be a superstar. It's huge, man. The biggest season we've ever had. You guys want to win this fight. Thank you. No pressure. So I'm sleeping and I'm sleeping and uh, I'm, I'm sleeping on the ground and I thought it was a dream. Kimbo slice and, uh, Marcus Jones and this and this d'amico D'amico Rogers, uh, comes in my room. They go, yo sharp. Get up, down. Get up, man. I'm like, Huh, why are there three large black? I run my bed. Kim Goes, Yo, man, this dude's down to talking about our people. We're about to jack him up. I literally, I thought I was in gym. I go, excuse me, it's talking about our people dog. Let's go eff this dude up and like, listen, uh, you guys realize, I said, I'm, I'm talking, I'm not down with the race thing. I'm totally down to fuck this dude up. But you realize I'm not black, right, Kim? He goes, you ain't no man. He goes, damn, that's crazy. Turnaround leaving. I hear. That's why I like shop. You can't tell what the hell he is.

Speaker 2:          04:25          I go, hey, Kimbo, that's racist. Dahlias, Ypo, just cause I'm athletic and can file you gotta be black. He goes, you could be. And

Speaker 3:          04:38          the other day I was, I was in Venice beach getting launched and I got a beer and a burger and enjoyed something that's known in the state of California to have medicinal benefit. And I looked up in the, uh, whenever this place was, this restaurant. And right over the door was the picture of Obama from his Hawaii days. He had the hat on and he was smoking a Doobie. And for like a half a second, I thought, that's my guy right there. That's 2008 campaign trail, Obama. And then of course, that's not what we got. We got smart Bush. Instead we got somebody who can like come onto to the tonight show or the view or something and just have the host's eating out of his hand by the end of the interview. So he's much smarter and more eloquent, but it's still doing a lot of the crazy shit that Bush was doing.

Speaker 3:          05:18          And I think that he could still, uh, kind of like, what's the word I'm looking for? Like, uh, uh, come out ahead and like still come across as a good president. If you were to legalize weed at the federal level, I think most people be like, oh, okay. He actually did something meaningful that will be around 50 years from now. And it's not just like, I'm going to tax, I'm going to find the shit out of you if you don't sign up for my healthcare website. And, uh, I've done more drone strikes than any other president in history. I've allowed NSA programs to expand and said almost nothing in response if you were even with all that shit, which I think is awful. Legalize weed at the federal level and I would rate him as a good president. Xi Are Hilarious,

Speaker 1:          05:58          first of all. I don't think that that's a joint. I think that picture is a cigarette. I've looked at it many times. I've studied it like this approved or film. Let's look at it quite closely. Have you ever noticed this when you're high? Like everything seems to be a reminder that your high, um, no because I've been getting high longer than you son. But the guys holding it, I never hold a cigarette like that. He's really enjoying it. Yeah. Let me slows that closing on that bitch. Let's get a CSI on this map. Look how many closer. Look how it's not like, like it looks squished and stuff like it's a role joint. We'll get this smoke signature and you know what? Here's a, here's another, here's another uh, point. Um, look how far down he's already smoking it. He would basically be in the filter. If it was a cigarette. You're right. 100% rolled his own cigarette. He's a cowboy. Wow. I know dudes who do that rolled menthols. Oh, how dare you. He's the commander in chief. You're a man, boy, he's the commander in chief. You son of a bitch.
