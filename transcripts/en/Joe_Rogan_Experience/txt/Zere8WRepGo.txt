Speaker 1:          00:00:01       Five, four,

Speaker 2:          00:00:04       three, two,

Speaker 1:          00:00:06       one.

Speaker 2:          00:00:07       Hello, Dr. so high, tap it and pull this sucker from your face. There you go. Yeah. Perfect. Thanks for doing this. Appreciate it. Thank you for having me. Uh, I've watched a bunch of your videos, have listened to a bunch of your talks, read a bunch of your work. Very interesting person. And this is a good time for a person like you. Things seem to be kind of scrambled a little bit. Yeah. A little topsy turvy out there these days. A little bit crazy. So you're a sex neuroscientist, is that an accurate description? I'm a former

Speaker 3:          00:00:37       academic sex researcher, uh, my Phd's in sexual neuroscience research and now I work as a science journalist and a columnist.

Speaker 2:          00:00:44       And why former

Speaker 3:          00:00:46       because the climate and academia has changed so much, like you mentioned how things are topsy turvy, but that's pretty much how you can describe academia nowadays. Even in the hard sciences.

Speaker 2:          00:00:57       Yeah. It's um, it's getting a little weird. What do you attribute it to?

Speaker 3:          00:01:03       I think it's a combination of things. I think it's a particular ideologies coming in and taking over, but they've been there for awhile, but I think it's at that they've reached the mainstream. I see it as political correctness running a mock and I see it as legitimate researchers not being able to speak out because they've got enough on their plate with their research, their teaching. They've got their students, you know, they're super busy and then on top of it they don't want to deal with the mobbing that will inevitably happen if they do speak out. So things are kind of in favor right now of the craziness.

Speaker 2:          00:01:35       But it's fascinating though as an outsider to watch the craziness. I bet. I mean I'm glad I don't have to be in school right now and deal with it, but to watch it from the outside, it's just so interesting. Interesting. In what way though? Well, because it's almost like there's a sort of a delusional aspect to it, like a, a, an agreed upon delusional aspect. It's like, like the gender one in particular, that gender is very strange right now. Like, um, there's a, there's first of all the Lbgtq. I a what else? Et cetera. Is there, and they're adding more to it. They keep adding more yet to be more inclusive. Okay. Jamie, something going on.

Speaker 1:          00:02:21       Focus is fucked up. Oh, what's going on? I got it. All right.

Speaker 2:          00:02:25       I thought maybe we were down again. Um, yeah, it just. But gender in particular. One of the things I said about one of the more bizarre things about today's political climate is that people selectively agree with science. It's like when it comes to client climate change, like everybody is like pro science, like science all the way. Look at the studies. Even when they don't even understand the studies. Like there's a famous and you know, I get in trouble when you bring up Tucker Carlson because people go, oh, you're a target Carlson fan. I'm

Speaker 4:          00:03:00       just as a human being, I'm not going to make. He made some very good points with Bill Nye. He had bill Nye on. They were talking about science and he said, okay, if human beings are responsible for climate change, what percentage? What are the numbers like? Bill Nye really isn't a scientist. He's a science. You know? What would your personality, those immediate personality, he's a guy who's a, you know, he's a promoter of science, but not really necessarily scientist, so he's. He doesn't, he doesn't have long term study and research to climate change. He's just sort of on there in a slightly arrogant way saying things that I agree with. What I agree with is that human beings are responsible, at least in part with climate change. This is what all the research points to, but when Tucker Carlson was pressing him on it, he really didn't have any answers for it, so it's one of those things where like people on the left will blindly support science in one way. Is that you or me? Dang it. If it's me, I'm going to be very upset with myself. I don't think it's me, but then when it comes to gender, you watch his show. He's got this wacky show on Netflix where they're. They're singing songs about gender can be fluid and gender could be. This is more than two. Yeah. There's more than two genders, which he didn't use to say. If you go back to one of his old.

Speaker 3:          00:04:19       I did see that there was another episode where they clearly say that gender is binary.

Speaker 4:          00:04:24       Yeah. This was like way back before all this nuttiness staff, so it's influencing people who are in the people are deciding instead of supporting science and supporting the research on actual human beings as a biological organism. Instead we're going with this bizarre politically correct climate which inclines people to this weird delusional thinking and as an outsider, that's what's interesting to me to watch all this scrambling, look at this weirdness. You know,

Speaker 3:          00:04:56       it's hypocritical. It definitely is. And it's interesting to see. I mean say the March for Science, I attended that not this past year but the year before. So people are there. They're super excited about science, pro science. I think science is great. All this money should go into science and you ask them, okay, so you're. So you're down for climate change being real, but what about science? Now by the left and I asked so many people this while I was there because I was reporting on it for playboy.com and it's amazing. People get very uncomfortable. They don't want to. They don't want to say anything about I would consider myself to be a liberal, but definitely liberals don't want to think about themselves being science deniers and when you look at how people talk about gender now and biological sex differences in the brain, even biology more generally, people get very defensive. They get angry almost, and if they find it threatening for some reason, which I don't understand, and that's a big part of my work is to say, I think we can acknowledge that these facts exist and that biological sciences legitimate. That doesn't mean that sexism is okay. We're not saying that women are inferior or anything like that.

Speaker 4:          00:05:56       Exactly. That's the big point about all this, right, is that we're not saying that anyone's inferior, but we're just not the same thing. This is what the big problem is to try to say, uh, I mean, I, I certainly think we should all have equal rights, but we're not equal in terms of what we are. We're a different we're. And it's not that we're not equal, like one's better. It's just like saying a wolf is not equal to achieve their fucking different things and males and females are different things and this is, this is clear when you study us as an organism, you know, I had a really bizarre conversation once with a guy who's a professor or a former professor and he was trying to deny that there there's a difference between men and women and one of the things I said, I said, okay, you get a dog.

Speaker 4:          00:06:44       Do you ask, is this a boy dog or a girl dog? And then he got real weird, but this is really no answer to that. Like it's a fucking boy dog. You want a boy dog, right? Is it a nonbinary dog? Like what is your dog? It might change. It's fine to Milo your dog gender fluid. Like what is gender fluid? Well, it's this idea that you can be one gender one day and another gentleman the other day or it might cycle through the day or doesn't your mix of both. That seems like if it was anything else, you would have to be fucking crazy. Right? It was. Anything else you feel like if you decided, well today I'm African, tomorrow I'm Chinese, you know, oh, today I'm tall tomorrow. I'm short today. I'm a Pixie tomorrow, but what else like that? I think everybody is.

Speaker 4:          00:07:28       We don't have to call it something like gender fluid. Everyone is a mix of male and female. Have people that are maybe more typically masculine and feminine, but even still there, I don't think there are many people that are 100 percent one way or the other not. Well, what does that even mean? I mean, people are clearly more masculine than other people, but does that mean that the people like, you know, let's pick a person, Bill Nye. Does that mean he's not a man? He's clearly a man. He's clearly a man. He's not a Lebron James, but he's a man. You know, there's, there's, there's obviously a spectrum, but I almost feel like that way of thinking is more old fashioned because this is all about being progressive and open minded, but I think if someone is a man, but it's maybe more female typical to say that this person has a different category of gender or that they're not mail, to me that's more stereotypical.

Speaker 4:          00:08:17       You know what I mean? I think it's not progressive to say if you're a mix of both, you must be something different. Well, you're not necessarily a mix of both, right? You just have a different hormonal profile are different. It's a different body types. Different. I mean people vary so much that. I mean I think having some sort of categories to say, oh, this is a male and this is a female. It seems like pretty beneficial. I mean although we vary so widely inside those categories to pretend that those categories don't exist just seems so weird. We would never do that with any other organism and it's a lot work to. You see

Speaker 3:          00:08:56       these companies going in, they're trying to be more and with the times I guess are there. Everything is gender neutral now and I'm thinking all of that money and time is being wasted when I don't think that does anything for, for women or sexism. If you changed instead of addressing someone by ladies and gentlemen, you say people. Is that really gonna stop sexism. It just makes people mad because then they have to change the way they talk.

Speaker 2:          00:09:18       I put a story on twitter the other day about people that are raising their kids with them.

Speaker 3:          00:09:24       I saw that. Yeah, calling them babies instead of babies. Oftentimes. What the fuck is that like her? Just. I think it's coming from. For some parents that's coming from a good place, like they obviously want the best for their kids and they don't want to limit the kid in terms of what they might be interested and I think because the media is telling them if you let girls play with dolls, that's terrible and they're going to end up, you know, not having any sort of prospects when they grow up in terms of their jobs or I don't know, it's such a terrible thing to be female. Typical nowadays, but I mean like you mentioned is biology. That's going to dictate what your kids play with. And then in other cases I think it's parents that want to be special.

Speaker 2:          00:10:01       Well, it's also weird because if your son is trans, it's totally fine for him to be female. Typical like it's celebrated. Like if you have a trans son and he likes wearing lipstick and short skirts and prints and around then he's fabulous. Like there was a boy in New York and there was this whole thing about he's the youngest ever drag queen and and everybody's going crazy and people were angry about it, you know? Yeah. Some people were angry and saying he was being exploited by his parents and some people thought it was wonderful that this kid was so expressive when he's so young, and then other people say, I had a good point. They said, well, it's very sexualized. Like how is this any different than someone who's in a beauty pageant like Jon Benet Ramsey type situation when were really young.

Speaker 3:          00:10:47       If it was a little girl, people would be up in arms sexist and that it's the patriarchy, but that little boy, so I don't know that he's trans. I believe that he just likes to like, like a man who's a drag queen is just a man. It's usually gay men who likes to, you know, like an extreme form of femininity. I love drag Queens, but I think that little boy is likely going to grow up to be a gay boy. If you have a little boy who says he's a girl and you see a lot of these trans girls, if they were left alone and they didn't transition, they would likely research shows they would grow up to be gay men is.

Speaker 2:          00:11:21       Yeah. I mean, I'm 100 percent for freedom, right, so I'm 100 percent for you being able to do whatever you want to do. The real question becomes when people are Trans and young, it's a how much, how much of this is going to pass and how much of this are you going to stop from ever passing because you're going to inject your body filled with hormones, like are you giving yourself the opportunity just to decide to become a gay man versus become a woman? Would you be happier either or.

Speaker 4:          00:11:54       It's very, very tricky,

Speaker 3:          00:11:55       but you can't even have that conversation because that's considered transphobic. What it is is homophobic though that you can consider that some of these kids just might be gay children. Yeah,

Speaker 4:          00:12:06       but then the. The gender fluid one. I was reading this article about this guy who varies by the day and like in the day like he'll have periods of stress will switch over to a woman. There was actually a radiolab podcast where they interviewed a person that has the same issue and the person was clearly abnormal in the way they communicated and the way they thought. It wasn't like you were dealing with some guy that you would trust with your taxes. You know what I mean? It was like the dude was wacky and then now he's a check and now he's back to being a guy and so he actually transitioned in mid conversation, like physically I didn't see it because it's just listening. Okay, okay. But he's like, well, now I'm Peter again. Oh, I see what you mean. Not Wendy. Hi Wendy. Well, it's. I don't know how much of that is indulgent.

Speaker 4:          00:12:58       I mean, I don't want. I don't want to say I know how you feel, but I do want to say, hey, are you fucking crazy? Is this, are we just. Are we just indulging crazy people and how to be. I do believe there are people that are trans. I absolutely believe that there are women that really are wired the wrong way and they should be men and there's men that are wired the wrong. It only makes sense. It only makes sense. Yeah, but I do also think there's people that are crazy. There's people that have legit mental illness, they're delusional and they're also very susceptible to influence and very susceptible to, you know, someone persuading them that they are one thing or another thing. Look, it's those like heaven's gate cult people who cut their balls off and wore the Nike's and decided to kill themselves when the comment was near number that yeah, that's not normal.

Speaker 4:          00:13:54       It's not normal for someone to be able to talk to you any cutting your balls off or putting on the purple sneakers or killing yourself when the comments close because there's a spaceship waiting. It's going to take you to Xenu or wherever the fuck you going. Right. That's not normal either. So we know that people are subject to very irrational behavior under the influence of other people's suggestions or other people's, you know, persuasion. Yeah, definitely. And this is a thing today where you have to wonder like how many of these people are legitimately trans, how many of these people are legitimately dealing with like a real mental issue that's causing them to shift from male to female and back again? And why is it that we can't ask these questions because why is it that even this question right now, I could be accused of being transphobic for asking how many of these people are ill?

Speaker 3:          00:14:43       Yeah. Well both of us were going to be accused of transphobia after this. Yeah, I mean, I would agree with that. I do think that gender dysphoria is a phenomenon and I do have a lot of empathy for people who are suffering. And I think for adults, they should be allowed to transition if that's what they decide to do, if that's something that will help them feel better. My issues with the kids, uh, it's, I don't think it's appropriate for children to be transitioning. And I can talk a bit more about why, but I think in terms of the pathology aspect, I think for, because gender is so trendy right now, and in the past you might have seen this kind of pathology manifests in a different way, but now because everyone is saying is the way to express, you know, I think people also see a fever problem in your life. They think it's gender related, so say with some of the personality disorder and people like a lot of attention, they like to, um, it's always about them and their identity and their identity shifts a lot. So this could very well be what it is and now they're being basically rewarded for that.

Speaker 2:          00:15:39       Yeah, that's the issue, right? That you're dealing with incredibly indulgent people which do exist and they then they find this pathway to massive amounts of attention. You know what I mean? This is, I, I had to construct a bit to mock Caitlyn Jenner, but it was a very complicated bit like I had to figure out how to do this. I was like, obviously this is nonsense and foolish, but I don't want to appear cruel, so what is the way to do this? So my way was to mock myself mercilessly and which is kind of true. Like I really do have three daughters and I really do get brutalized in my house. Like I really do think they chip away at my note. It's kind of a joke, but I mean it really is. It's all girly in my house. My fucking house is so girly. Everyone's girly.

Speaker 2:          00:16:23       They're always talking about girly shit. It's kind of hilarious. But the joke was that if my manhood was a mountain of marbles, every day they take two marbles, they just take one like you don't even need these, these, what do you care? God. And then that I'm not going to go out like Bruce Jenner, that one the one day that they. So I had to concoct this whole thing that they were demons, which is how they conjured up all that money. Like how else would they have hundreds of millions of dollars through no discernible reason. There's no, there's no way you could like explain to someone how they made so much money if they didn't understand our culture. It's totally irrational. Right? So the idea was that that they did this, but why did it was I wanted to sort of mock this thing that was happening where you've got a male Kardashians.

Speaker 2:          00:17:11       That's what he does. And who doesn't believe in gay marriage? Who decides he's a woman, which I firmly believe he's trans. I'm not denying that at all, but our obsession with it and rewarding him with ungodly amounts of attention. This motherfucker won the gold medal in the decathlon. Was it? The calphalon was right? Yeah. I mean he was on the cover wheaties. I mean he was a fucking us superstar athlete and then no attention after that, he was the whipping boy of the Kardashians on their TV show. They mocked him. It was like, here's this one with fucking talent. Your don't. They mock rob a bit fat, but then they go right to that. He becomes a woman and now he is the toast of the town. He wins woman of the fucking year. He's a woman for six months and he wins woman of the year. He Wins Espn athlete of the year.

Speaker 2:          00:18:08       He has been an athlete in fucking decades since Nixon was president, right? Or Carter, who was it? Either way, this is madness. This is where we're not treating this in a balanced way where we are rewarding people that instead of like, because people are so, they're, they're, they're, they're so ready to proclaim the progressiveness and so excited about it that they instead of like, instead of treating them as an equal, they go completely the other way. So there are definitely not prejudice. They're definitely not discriminating against them, but they're absolutely inflating what this person is and, and they're making it a big giant deal that they're trans. Like it's great to support people. I would like to live in a world where there's no racism at all, so you could mock everyone equally. Like, this is my big problem with real racism. There's a lot of dummies in every race, but you gotta be real careful picking on some dummies, like specially if you're a white male, straight, white male oppressor. You guys are the devil nowadays, especially if you look like me. I mean I looked like the devil, so this is a. This is a real problem with like looking at things in a balanced perspective because you're not allowed to not allowed. Like even what you said earlier, you said gender dysphoria, you know, that's considered transphobic.

Speaker 3:          00:19:40       Yeah. You can't even say that anymore even though that is a legitimate medical condition because some people see it as you pathologizing being the way someone feels, I guess, but in my mind I don't think the issue is pathology. The pathology, I think it's fine to acknowledge there are certain things like any, any medical condition that causes you distress and impairment. That's the definition of a psychiatric diagnosis, so you should be able to recognize that it's not a bad thing. I think the bad thing is the stigma that comes along with having a mental disorder, so that's what should be fought. It's the stigma aspect, not calling something a mental disorder. If someone's. If someone's really suffering, that's not a good thing.

Speaker 2:          00:20:18       No, no. It's not a good thing. And also the denial of these conditions and the denial of the science behind these conditions. This is the issue with progressive people today is that there's certain things where they embrace science and certain things where they deny it and in gender, gender in particular seems to be so hotly contested and I don't know when this happened, it seems to have happened right in front of our face. Like it, it just came out of the ground, like a plant that was growing in the crack

Speaker 5:          00:20:46       now to let try to stomp it out and it won't go away. I'm wondering, I'm wondering where the shit. Like I didn't see this coming and it's, it's fascinating to see. I think feminism is part of it. The mainstream aspect of this really far left feminism. I used to call myself a feminist. I don't anymore just because the things that people used to say feminism stood for like hating men being a. I don't know, just don't say that. Well, some of them do. They say they hate men. Oh yeah. I have friends who say my male friends who say to me, you know, my female friends said the men are trash. Is that normal? Well, there's a woman that I know that's a feminist that has on her, uh, her twitter account. It says, trust. No Man, like just openly proclaiming that if you're straight, good luck.

Speaker 5:          00:21:36       Good luck with your life. You're saying trust. No Man. But imagine if you said about women, you know, terrible thing. Yeah, that would be, that'd be awful as well. But it's acceptable to hate on men now. Well, nobody criticizes misandry, you know, it's just, it's not something that is, that gets brought up. I don't even, I've never even said that worked before. I've only written it and set it or written it and heard it. I mean, I get it. I do. I think feminism at the core had some good aspects in the beginning, but it's just gone off the rails more recently. Equality has great aspects, but I think the problem with any like white power is obviously awful. You say white power. Well you're, you're. What you mean is your racist against other races. You're into white people, but brown powers. Okay. Brown prides.

Speaker 5:          00:22:24       Okay. Right. Nowadays they see it that way. Yeah. Male pride is not okay. Not Okay, but girl pride is fine. Girl power is okay. Yeah. It's fucking weird because you're. You're, you're generalizing. You're lumping yourself into a group of people just because you all have vaginas and we don't all think the same, but the minute you as a woman say something that goes against girl power, they will descend on you. Yes. I've seen that too. Well, it's like you're threatening the collective agreed upon narrative and you are. It's like you like the way girls treat sluts. Girls get very mad if a girl just decides to have sex as many people as she wants because then you're fucking up this whole economy of controlling the narrative of when women decide to or not. Sex goes down that way too. Which is why prostitution's illegal. I see both sides.

Speaker 5:          00:23:22       I see some women, which I. which I find interesting because I think it's confusing for young women now who are starting to date and they think I don't really want to have casual sex, but I'm being told that's what I should do. Is that what they're being told? I think so. I think by whom? By the media more like it's empowering to go out and sleep with as many people as you want and to be like a man, like if you look at college campuses and how there's quite a bit of casual sex going on and I don't think that's

Speaker 2:          00:23:46       for everyone. I think from an evolutionary perspective to women don't like that as much. I was talking to a friend of mine today about this, uh, who's in the military and he was saying what's crazy about certain branches of the military is you have like 100 men to one women to one woman and one woman, especially if they're deployed and this, they have the pick of the litter and they'll just fuck her gang of dudes. Same time I would never talked about. I've never thought about it that way before, but he was like, you know, well everybody just sort of agrees that nobody has this one girl that nobody is going to own her and that she can have sex with as many guys as she wants to. Like the, what he was saying is like, at least in his experience that the whole dynamic of male female relationships shift and these girls can basically date as many of these guys that she wants.

Speaker 2:          00:24:41       It was kind of interesting and they don't shame her for that. Well, they can't because there's only one. It's like they don't want her to get angry at them too. It's like I didn't talk to them about it a lot. We always spoke about it for like 10 minutes, but it was like this. That's kind of crazy. I never even thought about that dynamic like that. That sort of a scenario where there's 100 men in one chick. That's a lot of men. That's a lot of men. Good luck with all that. You can get sore and you'd be like annoyed, like really cute. Let me alone and you're going to sleep. How much time does she have? You know? How much time does she have? Yeah, especially if you're in the military, you've got tasks, things you need to do. Yeah, but it's the dynamics shift according to like what is available and who's there and what kind of a culture you live in.

Speaker 2:          00:25:29       People adapt are very malleable to different climates and different cultures and the way people treat sex and don't treat sex and this is when I think what happens is people tend to react very aggressively or very strongly when someone is doing something that is different than the way they're doing things because this would possibly indicate that there's another way or maybe their was wrong or maybe it's just. And especially when it comes to sex, people get very strange. They do like when people find out that people are in open relationships. I have a good friend of mine who's in an open relationship and it's so fascinating to watch all the people. You have guys fuck your girlfriend, Bro. And he asked to sort of discuss it and the gas. This is, it's not comfortable for me. I wish I enjoyed it. I enjoy it. So why do they have an open relationship? I don't know. I mean they have to talk to them about it. I mean he's got bunch of different answers. I think the main answer is he wants to fuck other people and she wants to fuck other people and so they just decided to do it that way and they were together in a monogamous relationship for for awhile, but I think I am correct. I think they've been in an open relationship longer than they were in a monogamous relationship with a for. I would have to ask him I think

Speaker 5:          00:26:44       more than a year, maybe two years or something like that. And then it's been like four years of open. Open relationships are actually pretty common. Consensual nonmonogamous. There's one study that showed one in five Americans have actually tried it, so it's pretty common. Me Personally, I'm monogamous, but I think people should do what they want to do. If it's consensual. I think obviously having been a sex researcher and now someone who writes about sex research for a living, I'm very sex positive and I think a lot of the problems that we see in a lot of the suffering and distress and issues that people have in their lives could be solved. If our world was more sex positive, we could just talk about sex like anything else, right? The shame of it is the real problem and this is what I'm saying with that people when you're living a life that's different than the way they're living their life, they.

Speaker 5:          00:27:31       People get very aggressive about it. Same Way. I mean sober. People tend to get aggressive about people enjoy drinking or people enjoy smoking pot or taking mushrooms or something. They get very shitty about it sometimes and it's because it's very polar, very, very opposite of the way they're living their life and they don't want to see anybody living their life in a very different way, but also being happy. They think, well, this is not how I do it and this is contrary to my values, so you must be doing something wrong or you need alcohol to get by. Is that what you need? You need to like, oh, you don't need that drink. I don't want it. I just have it. If I have a glass of wine, I get happy. Who's getting hurt here and what? You're going to start doing heroin. Then you're going to wind up in the gutter.

Speaker 5:          00:28:14       I've never have never been on heroin, never been in the gutter, been alive for a while. Nothing's happened. Can be a bit of projection too. For sure. Someone who's dealt with substance issues that the fear that you know, it's very easy for someone else to fall down the same hole. Right, but it's this thing that people living a different way is somehow or another threatening, unacceptable and threatening to their perceptions of what, what you should be doing with your life. Yeah. Yeah, and I think, I mean this is very unrelated to the hole, but it's not. It's what, when it comes to gender, I think there's just this thing that people, people want things to be more easily explained than they are. That's true. I could see that because it takes a lot of work to actually go. So people who say that gender is a social construct, that's a good one.

Speaker 5:          00:29:08       Sounds very nice. I love saying that. It's not saying that, but it's infuriating because it's everywhere now. Like this is what children are being taught in school up in Canada. That's what they're being taught in their curriculum. And there's absolutely no truth to it at all. But I mean if you read the scientific studies, you cannot come away from them saying gender's a social construct. There's the argument for it if you were arguing for it that uh, I guess the, the idea is that women should be equal. And obviously as a woman, I believe that. And so

Speaker 3:          00:29:42       any sort of subjugation of women must somehow be imposed by society because if we acknowledged that women are different biologically in any way that's going to be used as justification why they don't deserve to be treated the same as men or they're not as capable as men, but yes,

Speaker 4:          00:29:56       different subjugation and why is different incapable? Why is different

Speaker 3:          00:29:59       in fairness? Because there has been a history of there being sexism and say. So with the whole Google memo thing and this idea that women are biologically, we are different. Not to say we're not as capable, but if there are any sort of biological correlates to what women find interesting, could that be extrapolated to capability extrapolated to women should go back to the kitchen. The women aren't good at math, things like that. I mean I get why people don't like biological explanations for things I didn't. Like you said, I think it's just a lot easier and it's a lazy way to just dismiss the whole thing and say, you know, we don't need to think about it. Nothing to see here.

Speaker 4:          00:30:36       Yeah. Nothing to see here. But it just, it's clearly not true in terms of the scientific research, so there has to be some cognitive dissonance in order to accept that and to preach it and to say it and everybody has to agree upon it, which is one of the reasons why I think any, any statements contrary to that get aggressively attack. And this is part of the reason why these ideas are so supercharged. It's that there's, there's a, there's an understanding that it's horseshit. And so when someone challenges it and says it's Horseshit, you've been living your whole life with this horseshit. It's almost like a religious thing.

Speaker 3:          00:31:17       Yeah. Well, okay. I think some people know what the truth is and they actively lie because they think they're doing something good for women. So they'll say gender is a social construct even though they know it's biological. And I think people who are younger may be going through school. Now we're being taught there's actually don't know the difference and actually believe it,

Speaker 4:          00:31:34       but why would they aggressively attack the scientific research that's contrary to that claim? Then?

Speaker 3:          00:31:43       You mean the people who don't know any better? They actually believe that gender is a social construct and these scientists are just sexist and misogynistic. Want to keep women down,

Speaker 4:          00:31:50       but I. I can get that if you didn't research it, if you didn't look into it, but once you start looking into it, you go, oh, well this is weird, but there's clearly.

Speaker 3:          00:31:59       Do you think people actually look into it though? I don't think they do. The sense I get is they. They find someone or some journalists who has had some sort of decent sounding criticism of the literature and they just pair it that I don't think they actually go and look at the studies.

Speaker 4:          00:32:14       Well, I think there's part of. There's definitely something to that and I think there's something to this problem that human beings have where they. They have an idea and that idea becomes a part of their identity and then they start arguing for that idea and any argument against that idea is an argument against them as a person because they're trying to win. They're not necessarily looking at things in an objective way where they're detached

Speaker 2:          00:32:40       from the idea and studying it as a thing. Instead they're arguing to try to win. I think that is a giant problem with ideas and in yes, and it becomes even more of a problem when it gets tribal. When these ideas are attached, like climate change, clearly attached in denial to the right in support to the left. It's this very strange tribal thing and that also happens with gender and it also like if you are in support of of women's rights and you are in support of trans rights and Lbgtq and all that jazz, you're almost 100 percent going to be on the left. It's just one of those tribal things. If you're pro choice, you're almost always going to be on the left. If you're not, you find yourself in that. Which one was. It was a Tammy Lauren. I get her confused with that.

Speaker 2:          00:33:31       Lauren southern girls. Those girls are interchangeable in some strange way. Those the, the hot Republicans and Tomi Lahren, Tomi Lahren, she's pro choice. She got attacked. Can Be can be. You want to be on this team, you want to be on the main white girl team. You can't be project you gotTa, you gotta be prolife. What about life? What about the baby's support debate? We, you know what I'm saying was like some ideas get locked into ideologies. They get locked into these tribal ideologies and gender is most certainly one of those because people don't want to be without a political home. Right? That's a very good way of putting it because if you do say, say someone like Tommy Tommy who is, why do I call it Tammy? Because I'm an asshole. She in trouble. Tomi Lahren will star in pro life film after the break. The blaze fired her for being pro choice. What if you're a pro choice conservative or if you're a pro biology liberal, you know, you kind of find yourself in a weird. In between. So she's just fucking going the other way. She's going the other way. She's gonna start a film. What's a pro life film? So ABC after school special. Don't have an abortion. Have your baby.

Speaker 2:          00:34:47       Yeah, it's weird. Well, she's got to get our ground back to kicked off the team a little bit. It's a bio pic on the Roe vs Wade case starting Stacey Dash. Oh, so, so maybe she's playing a bad person in that movie. Made it even more interesting. Strange. I wonder how many of those things are just distractions. You know, it's so weird. People are so weird with their, their, their tribal identities. You know, I, I just, and I love when they go back and forth and shift from one side or the other. I'd love it when like, wow, I'm a former conservative scene. The light or you know, I used to be a liberal to the party. Lost me. I love that. And then they go hardcore on the other side is weird because it's ever. Then everything is not just a couple of views. It's everything in alignment with the other side to join a church.

Speaker 2:          00:35:43       Stopped doing drugs. Yeah, it's fascinating. It's fascinating. Um, as a neuroscientist when something like the Google memo comes out, you are also a woman and you are also a woman who lost a person of color, sort of. Are you as I work, you're lighter than me? Well, you're a different color. Am My a person of color telling then I have the bolt. You can be an honorary person of color, I'll give you that bad. But I'm Sicilian so there's somebody. My background got fucked by somebody who was darker for sure, but I don't know how that works because if I was Cuban I would look exactly the same and I definitely could be a person of color I think is ridiculous. I can't stand that term for the record person of color because those of us who are not white, we don't all think the same, but we all get lumped in as having some sort of a wider conversation with a friend of mine about that who was Mexican and he was talking about Latinos and I go, well you do know that Italian was one of the original Latin languages, like I am Latino.

Speaker 2:          00:36:50       If you look at it that way, like what is Latino? Like you just thinking it was only Spanish. That's not really the technical definition of it isn't Latinos? I mean am I correct about that? I mean, it doesn't emanate from a Latin language think so I think so too, but it's just like Italians had been so ingrained in our culture. They came over so long ago that like, you know, my grandparents came here in the twenties so that that's a hundred years ago almost, so it doesn't count. It doesn't count anymore. You're not really discriminated against anymore. It's like Jews used to be. It's what's interesting is if you follow boxing history, and I know you're a martial artist, you follow boxing history, the oppressed early immigrants are almost always the best boxers at the time and for awhile it was a lot of Jewish boxers, a lot of Italian boxers.

Speaker 2:          00:37:36       Of course, you know, rocky Graziano and rocky Marciano and all these towns, and then it became a Cubans and Puerto Ricans and then it became, well there was always blacks as well, but this like immigrants in particular, Irish, a lot of Irish immigrants that early on they were thought of as being some of the lowliest of the low and now Irish people are 100 percent white, like no one even thinks about it. Of course they're white, but I mean they're, they're just American Asian. Soon we're going to be a hundred percent white basically. Well, not of Harvard has anything to do with. They're trying to kick you guys out. What is it about not trying to kick you guys out, but that is one of the weirder discriminations that is somehow or another slipped under the radar that they're making it more difficult for Asians to get into Ivy League universities because you guys do so well. I mean, it, it, it's racism, racism, racism, and I think some of these people who are getting pats on the back for being progressive about being diverse, I think they just don't

Speaker 3:          00:38:36       like us and now they have a politically acceptable way to do it. But why is that? Why would they not like Asians? Know some people just don't. Some people are racist, but is it that or is it that you guys do too? Well? Well, that's the thing. I mean, we throw that whole narrative into question, this idea that if you're not white, you must, uh, you, you can't be doing well in life. You can't pull yourself up and get on with things.

Speaker 4:          00:38:59       Yeah. Well that was the argument against the Charles Murray Book. What was that book? The bell curve? Yes. One of the problems with that book is people were showing the differences in ICU, um, by, you know, as it varies across different geographical segments and across races and if anything, that book is really a testament to the master race of Asians, but for real, right? Like Asians, we do okay. But genetically like Asian people seem to be superior when it comes to Iq according to that book.

Speaker 3:          00:39:36       I think we just work really hard in our culture. Puts a lot of emphasis on education.

Speaker 4:          00:39:42       Did you read the talent code? Really interesting book. I'm finishing it up right now, but one of the things about it is it's sort of dismisses the idea of talent and it shows. It goes into depth about all the D, not dismisses it, but shows that it's not. Some magic gift is bestowed upon people, but what it is is it shows all the pathways that lead to the skill developments that we considered talent and discipline and hard work in particular discipline being a culturally inforce thing, which it is with many Asians. I often talk about my friend junk sick who when I was doing taekwondo, he was on the US team while he was also in his residency in medical school. Sky was I fucking animal. I'd, I never met anybody in my life who worked as hard as him. He always looked exhausted. This is face all the time.

Speaker 4:          00:40:34       I just was always tired, but then would go to work like a fucking savage was inbetween studying for his do you know, in the middle of a medical school and he would put his backpack on, filled with books and run the stairs at, at the university. He's fucking crazy, but it's. This is. And I would, I would talk to them about it, you know, because my parents were not like that and his parents were like, my parents were hippies and they were like, do whatever the fuck you want. We don't care, and his parents were like, you must be a doctor, and he was like telling me about the kind of discipline that he grew up with and that culturally enforced discipline leads, many, many, many, many, many people to succeed. Whereas, you know, the sort of latch key kids that I grew up with, there was no. There was no culturally enforced discipline. You either developed it on your own, you pursued something that you enjoyed and figured out how to become discipline or you just weren't you. But this thing that's in Asian cultures is what's propelling them forward. If you subscribe to all the different things that are being brought up in this book, the talent code and it makes sense. It only makes sense.

Speaker 3:          00:41:48       I think it should be seen as a positive thing that you know, everyone is capable. It's not just a particular race or a particular group of people that can be successful. I mean, my issue with the whole thing with the Harvard law students that why are Asians being punished for doing well, essentially explained the lawsuit for people that don't. So it turns out that for decades now, Harvard has been discriminating against Asians and requiring them to have higher sat scores than people of other ethnic backgrounds in order to get the same chance of admission. And then more recently it's been shown that, okay, so Asians do well with sat scores. They do all the extra curricular activities. So the only way that admissions committees can actually penalize them is through writing their personality. So seeing them as less likable, things like that because they're subjective and uh, you know, I find it amazing that very few liberal outlets I've covered this. Um, the New York Times has been one, but outside of that it's been very few and it's really disappointing and no one has. I mean I wrote about this for the Globe and Mail and I was amazed. No one had heard about this story at all.

Speaker 4:          00:42:51       Well, not only that, even when I was covering the New York Times or burglar. Okay. Yeah. Let's go on with our day dawn. Like in and out. Yeah. Whereas if it was in about any other subject or any other race or gender, there's being discriminated against. I mean if it was discrimination against black people in the same systematic way or systemic way, it would be outrageous. People go crazy. Yeah, and even more insane that you're doing it to the most successful people. The most successful in terms of academics because that's the problem,

Speaker 3:          00:43:26       right? The problem is helping society either. I mean if if I were not Asian, I would be saying the same thing. I don't think it makes sense to take people who are doing well and hold them back. If you, if you want your society to do well, I think the solution would be to help people. We're not doing as well. Don't penalize the people who are doing well.

Speaker 4:          00:43:42       Well, I think there's a fear of Asians. I'm not bullshitting and one of the. I've been obsessed with this company walway recently and what I got obsessed with them for two reasons. One, because I read an article about the superiority of the cell phones that they're producing that are not being accepted in America, and so then I started doing. I'm kind of a Dork when it comes to like cell phones and technology. I'm very fascinated by them, so I read a lot of articles about walway phones and they have these fucking insane Leica cameras, a 40 megapixel lenses, three lenses on the front and 20 plus Megapixel selfie cameras and like really intense technology. Much more, much higher. Like I think they have 500 gigabyte storage capacity. Four thousand milliamp batteries. Like they're superior battery. It's a superior phone and I'm looking at. I'm like, wow, this is kind of crazy.

Speaker 4:          00:44:44       And then it turns out you can't sell them in the United States and the federal government's blocked these carriers from having them and they're saying it's because the Chinese government is involved in stealing information and hacking and all this different stuff. I'm like, okay, all right. Maybe but, but, but it's kind of fucking weird that you can't figure out whether or not a phone is being used to like, how are these hackers, how these super genius people who program phones, you can't look at one of those phones and and figure out what it's doing because he's doing some magic or, or another. It's stealing people's information and there's no mechanism that you can detect. What do you think? There's another reason why they are not letting them know. What I'm worried about is that they're scared that these companies which are fanatical, maniacal in a aggressive pursuit of dominance in the cell phone markets and technology in general are going to take over and they're going to squash all these American companies.

Speaker 4:          00:45:43       And I was like, how much. I mean, this is my own personal speculation, but I'm looking at this. I'm like, how much? How much legitimacy. Isn't that because they're right now worldwide. I believe that the number three cell phone manufacturer, I think it's Samsung, apple, and then walk away, but you can't buy Huawei phones in America and I'm wondering. Yeah, we're scared of the Chinese taking over. Are you going to try and get one of these phones anyway? I did try to get one, but what I've found out is they're not, um, they're not set up for the US market. The GSM phones and I'm on a CDMA network, but the GSM phones, they using different bands. They're not using all the same bands. Like when you buy a phone from China, even if it's for the UK, they don't use. So if you, there's some places we would sacrifice coverage. Say if you bought a and if you are a cell phone genius out there and you'll listen to me butcher this. I'm so sorry, but this is all I got. What's up?

Speaker 2:          00:46:42       Could you just use it with Wifi only and not connected to the fuck would you do that because you're in the Wifi. Almost ended up talking about as a phone. I know, but where's Wifi? You driving your phone, your Wifi when you're driving your car. How are you doing that? Time Warner has wifi all over la if they have wifi problem with tracking you. But yeah, definitely 100 percent. Okay. So if you're driving in your car, you could be on Wifi and have your cell phone service shut off. Cars also now have them built into their thing too. There's those are cellular. Your cellular logic. It was just a question, couldn't you also. But that's a cellular Wifi. So you'd have to have a cellular account. So like who would be your cellular provider? Then you're just connecting your phone to a Wifi thing and you're right, that's a different thing.

Speaker 2:          00:47:19       BMW or Mercedes, right? So whatever that is would be a local thing. You'd have to be right next to your fucking car. You use your phone. That's stupid. What I'm saying is the problem with the. This is what our article that I read does explaining the problem from. I think it was one of those tech sites, but it was saying that in certain places with limited coverage, you probably would have no coverage with one of these phones. Whereas it would work. Okay, if you were in New York or in Los Angeles or Chicago or something like that, but if you went to the boonies where you might get, if you have verizon, you probably could be able to text your friends or get a phone call out, but you wouldn't be able to do that would be a lot harder. Yeah. It's just not optimized for our networks. Well, hopefully it'll change or not. We're not just keeps quashing them, but I wonder did the problem is I believe they think walway is connected with the communist government. Yeah. Yeah. They're completely integrated, so it's. I mean, the separation of business and government over there is. It's very sketchy, right? Yeah. The fuck do I know? I'm just. I just wonder if there's a fear of Asian success. Yeah, I mean how could that be though? The Samsung. Samsung is everywhere.

Speaker 5:          00:48:34       They're, I mean, they're going to come for everybody, so they're coming for us right now. It's only a matter of time. You know, who's they? The people who want equality of outcome for everyone. Oh, who are those people? The people who are really into identity politics. Do you think, wow, I didn't really think that's what was holding back Walway I thought it was the government, the government was worried about them getting too much money and power, but I guess if you're asking me in terms of my, my view on things and in my experience, that's where I would take it. So the equality of outcome people,

Speaker 2:          00:49:05       the reason why they're trying to keep Asians or at least limit the number of Asians in. But does that have the opposite effect? Doesn't that make Asians work even harder? And I mean if you keep them out of Harvard, they're just going to go to Yale,

Speaker 5:          00:49:22       keep Medicare doesn't have numbers like that. So at Caltech, there're a lot of Asians there because they don't, uh, they don't discriminate so they just dominate. So you use Caltech as a petri dish? It can be like a controlled. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:49:35       Hmm. But what's wrong with that? It's like, but no, no, no. The other thing, like what's wrong with certain cultures dominating?

Speaker 5:          00:49:46       I don't think there's anything wrong with that. I think, well, I mean if you're asking me in terms of what people see as a problem, I think because it looks as though other groups are not getting a fair chance. It doesn't make. It doesn't make people feel good, right? Because it means that you're acknowledging at some level that some people are doing better than other people and that makes some people uncomfortable. Right? It's the participation trophy world, the equality of outcome world. Yeah. That's exactly what it is. Right? But it's gone to a place where it becomes indefensible, so instead of raise trying to raise up people whose scores are lower and them any an equal

Speaker 2:          00:50:28       opportunity or take people from impoverished areas with poor education and give them more of a chance, which is what affirmative action was supposed to be about. Yeah. Instead of that, you're doing it from the top down. You're going to many of these people that are doing good, we've got to squash it, will limit their ability, but how could they do that in good conscience? That's what's crazy, but did doing it from that perspective, doing it like looking at a race that's super successful, that is also a minority and saying too many of them.

Speaker 5:          00:51:01       Well that's the thing. I mean I think these people do think they're doing something good. They're doing it for the better of society and for these other groups. I like to see it too. Have you ever talked to someone about it? That's pro discrimination against Asians? I have, after I wrote that column for the Globe and Mail and number of people came out of the woodwork to tell me how wrong I was and there was some white, some Asians do well to say don't let yourself be used by the far right to justify, you know, taking down other groups. Oh, that's an interesting way of looking at it. Yeah. So that. I mean that's one way that you could look at it, but

Speaker 2:          00:51:36       was that way possible to look at it? That doesn't even make any sense. You. How would the far. Right, so the fire, Rachel hold of the superiority of Asians in academics

Speaker 5:          00:51:49       because there are other racial groups that they don't like or I guess they disliked more than they dislike Asians, so they'll use Asians as a way to justify discrimination against those other groups. I don't. I don't really buy that, but that's an argument I've heard the arguments sucks. I'd like to sit down with someone with that argument. That's a stupid argument. That argument doesn't work. It doesn't work. What I find the most sad is there are Asians who are totally fine and they say, I'm willing to give up my spot for someone else because I think diversity is important and I think that someone who needs friends, you need friends so bad you willing to say that, but that's a virtue signaling thing. That's one of those. I hope so. I hope it's purchasing the. It's not someone who actually thinks that way.

Speaker 2:          00:52:30       They could actually think that way, but the people cut their balls off and killed themselves because they thought the comment was coming in the spaceship is behind it. They thought that too. People think all kinds of things. They think all kinds of things. Yeah, and that is one of the main reasons why I wanted to talk to you is that people do think all kinds of things I want to, I want, you know, I want to talk to neuroscientists, figure out what's happening.

Speaker 5:          00:52:54       What is it? Yeah. Let's, you were saying something about the Google memo earlier though. Yeah, yes.

Speaker 2:          00:52:59       Yeah. That's A. I mean, I had james on and you know, he's kind of fucked now. He doesn't really have a home. He doesn't have a place to go. And I mean in terms of like, like politically, politically or in terms of having a job. I mean he's like almost hireable. I mean, uh, I don't know if he's employed now, but he was in this lawsuit with Google and scientifically he has every point in the. I just don't know

Speaker 4:          00:53:26       if it's ever going to hold up in this climate.

Speaker 3:          00:53:28       Yeah. So I actually got a chance to talk to james as part of. So there's a podcast wrong speak that I host with Jonathan Kay and our first episode was actually about James to and his saga and basically how, what I took away from that whole thing, I mean it's been almost a year now. It's amazing how the media could not get it right and I feel that they intentionally smeared him. It wasn't that people didn't understand the science so that they very intentionally said we don't like this. We want to get clicks or we want to basically sacrifices man for our agenda.

Speaker 4:          00:54:01       I agree with you and I don't think it's just the media. I think it was the CEO of. Was it youtube that was saying that it was promoting harmful gender stereotypes? Vp of Google put that statement out there. Other people. Yeah, but one of the, one of the women that ran youtube was talking about a two and the way she was describing it was as if he was talking about women being inferior and that's not what he said or somebody said, and not only that they neglected to to promote the fact that it was at least a page and a half of that memo was about how to encourage women to be more active in tech. Yeah. This was not an anti woman scream.

Speaker 3:          00:54:39       No, no, and I mean if you hear what he had to save when I spoke with him, he very much was for equality and very much it was for men and women being working together, you know, and it's not a misogynist. I think it's crazy that that's the narrative that continues to go on now.

Speaker 4:          00:54:55       Well, the problem is he actually started. He actually cited the studies that showed why people choose different professions, why people gravitate towards different activities in different professions based on gender. And these are actual studies. So in inciting those studies, he cited something that's contrary to this promoted narrative and that's where he was shot down. Hence the title of your podcast. He did wrong. Speak, right?

Speaker 3:          00:55:27       Yeah. And the thing is, the most important aspect of the podcast is that the things that people are saying, there's some truth to it. It's not just crazy loopy ideas, right? There's, there's truth to it. But for some reason we still can't say it. And why is that?

Speaker 4:          00:55:42       I don't know why that is. But the problem with denial of any facts is that the people that are opposing you now have evidence that you're alone, right? Like one of the problems with the left and this really radical progressive behavior that's in denial of science is now the right gets to look at the lab and go, look, these people are their fucking mind. Why do you trust him about abortion? Why do you trust him about this? Why do you trust them about climate change? Clearly there loons and this, this is mean. This is just weird toxic tribal behavior.

Speaker 3:          00:56:20       Yeah, because I mean, how can you legitimately denied, like you're saying, men and women are different when you say that people stop listening, they do think you're a crazy person and they miss the larger point because there are some people who will look at that and say, okay, men and women are different. That must mean women are not competent. So instead of having this more nuanced argument or discussion about we can be different, but that doesn't mean women are in competent. They just simply say, you want to say that men and women are the same, so we, you know, we're not even speaking at the same level and in that case,

Speaker 4:          00:56:49       well it's so foolish and we are, there's clearly differences between men and women and there's clearly differences inside genders. I mean there's human beings very widely and wildly and it's one of the more interesting things about us. I mean, it's a good thing. It's a fascinating thing because it's, the whole thing has got to go like this. It's got to move around. And the only way it moves around as if everybody's different. If everybody just a block, it's the same shape, the same density, the same size, like what is that? That's. Well, it's not just boring. You're not going to have a competence society. It's not going to work like you need soft and hard. You need both. You need something in between. You need far extreme right to polarize and activate the far extreme left. I mean I really think you need a guy like trump to get people to be more politically active and more socially active.

Speaker 4:          00:57:46       I think in many ways he does the left of service by providing this like ridiculous figurehead of what's possible with ego and greed and and and right wing gone a muck Steve Bannon's and the breitbarts and all that. Stuff like that. Stuff empowers the other side and the good thing about it is somewhere in the middle is like a balanced healthy society and hopefully we'll be able to achieve that someday. But I mean this is the argument always is that you cannot have light without dark and have good without evil and the pendulum is gonna Swing back, hopefully just waiting for that to happen. It always does, it seems to always do that. I just would hope that with the amount of information that's available today that we can look at the actual studies that are being done on gender, on sex, on biology, and don't look at it in terms of don't quantify it in terms of the this side's better.

Speaker 4:          00:58:40       That's it's better. Just look at it. What fascinating differences. This is amazing and it's interesting and there's a lot of dummies that are men and there's a lot of dummies that are women. They're just dummies and it doesn't have anything to do with one gender being superior or one gender being inferior. It's just human beings have a lot of variability and there's a lot of different things that a lot of inputs and you developing and becoming a 30 year old person that happens to be talking to this other 30 year old person. Your path to get to wherever you are. There's so much going on. There's influences in terms of your environment, your education, your, your life, your family, your loved ones, your. There's so much that leads to you being who you are today and it's really fascinating to study that, but only if you're allowed to actually look at it

Speaker 3:          00:59:35       and be honest with you because there's no point otherwise if you're just going to keep pumping out, like from a research perspective, you, if you go in, the only scientists are going to look at this stuff now. The people who know what they're going to find in advance, they're not going to publish anything that's gonna upset the public. So in my mind there was no point to even do that kind of research because that's not actually science what you're doing.

Speaker 4:          00:59:54       Yeah, that's really crazy, right? That's where it gets really crazy or you're not even allowed to do certain kinds of research or if you are doing it, you're going to be categorized, oh, he's all right. Or your, you know, you're conservative or you're a whatever. Whenever you are, you're bad. You're wrong. Speak.

Speaker 3:          01:00:15       Yeah. Yeah, exactly. And why did you decide to call your podcast that? I mean, it's, it's a throwback to Orwell, obviously in 1984, and this idea that by controlling language we can control the government, can control how people think and what reality is. And what I find interesting is with the topics we covered. So first episode we talked to James Damore, second episode we talked to Lindsay Shepherd and looked at the whole what happened at Wilfrid laurier university. Um, and then the third one is rapid onset gender dysphoria. So looking at this trend and adolescent girls who come out as transgender even though they've had no previous signs of gender dysphoria. And so with all of them, these, these issues are all super taboo and all these people have been mobbed. And in the case of rapid onset gender dysphoria, you see the parents who are being called Trans phobic for questioning is my daughter really trends, you know, we're just trying to get at the truth. Really. We're trying to understand, you know, why is it we can't talk about these things? Why is it we're in such a situation now that the, the response to any sort of, um, unpopular idea is to be mobbed into attack people and intimidate them and shut the conversation down. Like how do we stop that from happening?

Speaker 4:          01:01:24       Explained rapid onset gender dysphoria because I'm not really aware of that.

Speaker 3:          01:01:28       So it's this phenomenon that's been growing more recently. How recently, I'd probably say in the last 10 years there's been a switch though before, a referrals to gender clinics have kids who are feeling that they are born the opposite. Sex was predominantly boys. And then suddenly there's been this explosion of girls. And so when you talk to the parents, um, and it's interesting when, when you listened to the episode that we did, their stories are so similar. They're literally identical. They, their daughters have always been gender typical. So they're always very girly girls. They've never been gender dysphoric. They go through puberty, they develop, you know, there's no problem there. Then usually what happens is there's some sort of Dunno educational session at school or one of these girls, their friends come out as trans. And then the daughter says, oh, I want to be a boy.

Speaker 3:          01:02:14       And so if you take that child to a professional like therapist, the therapist has to affirm, the therapist can question that. And so you have these girls, a lot of them have autism or they have other mental health issues. They're not getting treated for those issues. Instead they're being told, okay, if you want to transition will help you. And like I said, I'm not against adults transitioning. I don't think it's anyone's place to tell an adult what to do. And I think transitioning can be beneficial, but you want this. If someone transitions, you want it to actually help them feel better. And for these girls, if the issue is not even about gender, it doesn't make sense for them to transition

Speaker 4:          01:02:50       mother's rapid onset gender dysphoria. Is this typically females? Yeah,

Speaker 3:          01:02:54       almost all females. What would, what is the cause of that? I think it's social contagion. I think part of it is for some of these girls they are a bit socially awkward and so when they come out as transgender, suddenly everybody loves them and wants to support them. And I think as people should for trans people, because obviously it's a difficult thing to go through, but I think there's an aspect of it that people aren't talking about that kids are coming out as transgender just because it gives them acceptance,

Speaker 4:          01:03:19       an extra reward. There's a reward in terms of the attention. Right?

Speaker 3:          01:03:23       Yeah. And also I think for girls, I mean puberty is not a fun time. Puberty's not a fun time for anybody, but for God, you didn't go through puberty. Okay.

Speaker 4:          01:03:33       Okay. I did. But I mean, you know, for like I love when people say, well, it's harder for guys. Who the fuck would, you know, he never been a girl. It's hard for everybody. Everyone is kind of awkward and Lanky. You know, life is hard. Life is weird. You being a person being a finite organism, cleaning to a ball, it's spinning a thousand miles an hour hurling through infinity. That's weird. Life's weird. And then the fact that your biology changes and you get inundated with hormones, it's uh, just the, the life that we live and then adapting to culture and trying to figure out how to be accepted. And I think that that certainly plays a part, this rapid onset gender dysphoria. How is this being treated like in terms of like how's this being accepted in academia? How's it being discussed in the literature and what are the recommendations for what to do about it or to descriptions of what it is.

Speaker 3:          01:04:27       Well, there's only been one study so far that's been published because it is such a new phenomenon and because it is so hard to do this work because, I mean people call it a myth pretty much anything that counters the transgender narrative is considered hate speech. So as a researcher, if you try to do any research on this issue that goes against what trans activists say is acceptable, you know, you're going to get into trouble. So no one wants to touch it. So there's been one study that did show, you know, with girls especially, it's very much about being influenced by friends within a peer group. I think there's some crazy high number in terms of the number of girls that will come out as transgender one after the other, so it's real. But I, I mean I get why people find it, some people find it threatening because it suggests that maybe trans people aren't really transgender, you know, maybe the way they feel isn't legitimate, but in terms of the way to treat there are these parents are at our last. I mean the, the, these girls are not getting treated for the underlying condition. There was one parent we spoke to, he saw nine mental health professionals. Every single one said that your daughter's not transgender, but they couldn't go on the record as saying. So I think only one went on the record of saying so because they're terrified.

Speaker 4:          01:05:35       They're terrified of losing their job. They're terrified of being attack. Yeah. Yeah, definitely. It's so interesting where you watched the similarities between any group that like is that feels that they're being maligned or that are being very defensive about their position and trying to hold strong and aggressively attacking people that are against it. It in many ways this sort of behavior is mirrored in the second amendment. People like the people that are pro gun, like if you tried any gun restrictions or any gun legislation or any changes in the laws of gun control, they aggressively go after it. They, they, they do whatever they can to keep things the way they are now and show how much positive benefits guns have and how, how many people are saved by guns. But it's this thing besides the gun, take the gun out of it and it's this.

Speaker 4:          01:06:33       It's the defense of the idea. It's like very committed. Yeah, they are. They identify with being a person who's a gun nut or a gun supporter of Second Amendment, you know, freedom loving and I got a fucking eagle on my back. You know, that kind of shit. And it's like. And this the same thing with trans people. Like anything against anything, what you're saying, this is impossible. This thing that you're talking about, this rapid onset gender dysphoria being autistic people that is transphobic and the and they get super hyper aggressive about it. Instead of saying, Oh, well, whoever this person is, if they're a trans person, so saying, well, I am legitimately trans, but his entire po entirely possible that there's a broad spectrum of human behavior and human thought and that some of these people have a real issue and I could see the reward, especially in today's climate. When you look at today's climate was that would be an interesting study, right? If you look at the climate of today and the support of trans people and the attacking of people that are transphobic and the the overwhelming social benefit of supporting trans people and then you look at the rapid onset gender dysphoria and see if they match up what you were saying. Actually I. The

Speaker 3:          01:07:47       majority of Trans People are not on board with this whole across the board. Everyone should just transition, but I think it's. It's another case of the vocal minority saying shutting down. Anyone who dares to disagree,

Speaker 4:          01:08:00       well, some trans people get very upset if non trans people talk about Trans people were just hilarious. Like what are we supposed to do? Supposed to just shut our mouths and let you just run things like shit, I don't know what to do. Like the Scarlett Johannsen things fascinating. She was going to play a trans woman in a movie and people freaked out. Trans Man, sorry, a trans man in a movie and people freaked out that she is not trans and she's. She has this part, you know, that was the same thing that happened with Jeffrey tambor. Jeffrey tambor was accused of sexual harassment by people in the set who are trans, who were also very upset that he was the star of a television show that was about trans people and he's not trans and they were trans. I get where people are coming from. I do because you know, they.

Speaker 4:          01:08:47       I think representation is important to some extent and so I can understand if you are of a group that isn't being represented in the media, how you would want that to change. Yeah. But you also looking at an alias actress who would bring an incredible amount of attention to your progressive project and you know, it may very well change the tone of the way people accept trans people. Like if it's portrayed in a positive light, it's entirely possible that it would open up. Like, especially if people that are on the fence, it might open up their heart and they make them look at things differently and say, oh, okay, I see where this woman wanted, you know, she, she wanted to transition to be a man because she was wired incorrectly or wired to be a man. I shouldn't even say it incorrectly. Like maybe you could see her as a person now instead of just as a subject for debate or as a career I would have, is not with your appointment with my point with the tokenization of people.

Speaker 4:          01:09:49       So to say, okay, if this is a trans role, we need to find a trans person. Right. You know, same as with racial tokenization. Like we need to have a certain quota so we need to have this many number of people that fit this. That's my only issue because then people look at it and say, you only pick this person because of their identity, not because of what they brought to the table. True. But I could argue against that. If you go back and look and like John Wayne when he played gingiss con, like what in the fuck was that? Well, there's a bunch of those really goofy ones like Charlie Chan. Do you ever see the old school Charlie Chan movies? I think so. I think we can find Charlie Chan. It's fucking ridiculous. I mean, couldn't even get an Asian guy to play Charlie Chan, but the fuck is this.

Speaker 4:          01:10:30       Or maybe they didn't even. They didn't even try to make John Wayne look like he was Chinese. You know? I mean there was a lot of that going on. You do you ever see that ad where you see the native American? Yeah, there's, there's the guy who played the. Kathleen did that motherfucker doesn't even look a little Chinese and he talked like a real stereotypical, like shitty Chinese accent. It's a bit offensive. Super Offensive. Right? But that was the sign of the Times. And so what trans people would say, it was like, look, this is the same goddamn thing. This is just you're looking at in terms of Chinese people were looking at in terms of our people and you know, we're not being represented

Speaker 2:          01:11:14       and you have someone playing us. Do you remember that native American ad? There was an ad where someone would throw litter out of the car window and the native American guy had a tear running down his cheek. I do remember that. Yeah. The Guy was Italian. He wasn't even a little bit of American. Will they do now? Anybody listening? Some people know because I didn't like, I'm not a researcher. I didn't. I didn't go deep and investigate. I would just read it. I was like, that's hilarious. Yeah. I mean, I think for a lot of these issues at the core, there's something valuable there. I do get the concern and I am empathic for that, but it's to the point now where it's like every little thing. Yeah. Well people, this is the outrage culture. People were like super pumped to find something that's outrageous and then point fingers and attack and they love it when people back down.

Speaker 2:          01:12:02       Oh, they're so excited. So like when scarlet Johannson backed out of that movie, everybody got so excited. We did it. Girls, we've fucking got her, you know, and, but when people don't back down, they get, they just give up or they get confused. They don't know what to do, but that's the thing I find when you don't back down, they go and they find someone else, they'll leave you alone. Do you see what happened to Anthony Jeselnik? No, I didn't. They're attacking Anthony Jeselnik. They're attacking a bunch of people for tweet jokes. After James Gunn got fired. You Know James Gunn is, he's the guy who was the director of Guardians of the galaxy. Uh, he had some really questionable tweets that were jokes. They're just, he wrote some jokey joke things, but it's like about pedophilia. Like there was like a huge screen of them copied and pasted. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          01:12:52       Yeah. They're fucking terrible. The problem is they're not funny in the end, their jokes and they're really gross, but should he be fired for that? No, he's just a shitty joke teller. If you find out he's actually a pedophile, that's one thing, but it's Disney in this. Today's climate, so then they find that Anthony Jeselnik, the standup comedian has a bunch of also offensive jokes and some of them about pedophiles and so they go and try to attack him and Anthony Jeselnik rights. Looking through my twitter timeline. Something along. He said, looking is like looking for a needle in a needle store on customer appreciation day. So true waist, his whole fucking thing is his character. Like Anthony Jeselnik in particular, I'm friends with him. His whole thing is being ruthless and super offensive. Like he had a show called the Jeselnik offensive. I mean that's what he does. He set his character is he's an awful person. That's the character and so they just gave up. It's totally lost on people now, right? You can't. You just can't say things, period. Well, they're looking for people to back down and they're looking for people to get scared and then, I mean, this is fun. It's fun to find a target and find a, let's get him fired, get her fired kicker tagger off that movie.

Speaker 4:          01:14:12       It's fun for them because as you know, Hashtag air quotes activist. What they're doing is they're just attacking and there's probably some good out of it, but look, there's gotta be some good for sure. Out of real monsters getting arrested, right? There's, there's some good out of like the Harvey Weinsteins and the bill cosby's the world getting arrested and getting busted and shutting down and we would hope that other monsters in waiting would not act out on their instincts because of the fact they're worried about the repercussions that you're clearly seeing and that we would hope that people that are behavior as a culture shifts one way or another and then it's gonna move as far away from massage and he is possible and it's whether it's through the threat of incarceration or shame or whatever it is that causes it to go the other way. It's probably for the best as long as it doesn't go as far as all men are pigs, all men are creeps. All men are trash and that's what we were talking about earlier. Like when it gets to that place, you got to go, well this is not. This is not a good place to be.

Speaker 6:          01:15:23       Well also if there is an allegation that that's taken at face value right away, because we do see unfortunately that some of these allegations are false.

Speaker 4:          01:15:32       Well, it has to be this whole idea of believe women. Well, okay, but that was okay. Does that mean don't believe men because some women lie and some men lives. What about individuals? What about human beings? So if we're going to be. It's what we were talking about earlier, like white power, black power, Brown power. Well let's fucking human beings. As soon as we stopped looking at human beings as individuals and we just agree that one group is good and one group is bad. You've got some real discrimination problems. Yeah.

Speaker 6:          01:16:05       Well you can't win in that way either because you can't look whether you side with believe all victims are. I believe, what is it? I believe women or something like that, if there's a Hashtag, believe women believe so I believe survivors or something like that, right, and then or if you say you want due process and women lie and you know that side of the equation, I think even both sides are equally bad because you're not getting at the truth

Speaker 4:          01:16:27       or also in this weird slippery thing when it comes to human beings and truth because it's so hard to tell who's telling the truth. If two people see something or you see a car accident and one person says, well, this lady ran the red light and slammed into the car, and then the person right next to it says, no, she didn't. This other guy ran the red light and she hit him and this.

Speaker 6:          01:16:50       There's a lot of subjectivity in terms of like interpersonal relationships.

Speaker 4:          01:16:55       Well, there's also a problem with just describing things and language. In reality. It's hot. I don't know if you're telling the truth. I don't know mean especially if it's just like, you know, I, I leave, I go to the bathroom, I come back and Jamie says she, she just call me a piece of shit and you're like, no, I didn't like, okay, well who's right? I don't know. I don't, I literally don't have a mechanism to detect who said what it is not possible. Yeah. So am I just going to believe women or am I going to believe the individual or am I going to try to like figure this out? Am I going to do my detective work? Fuck. It's very tricky. So when you're dealing with some certain accusations when it comes to human beings like this, Chris hardwick things, a perfect example of that.

Speaker 4:          01:17:39       I mean he was just reinstated yesterday by AMC and um, yeah, that's a weird one because she wrote the, it was an ex girlfriend that wrote something about him. Yeah. I read that most clearly didn't tell the truth about some aspects of their relationship. She cheated on him and that's why he got rid of her or broke up with her and then he or she also said he was just terrible boyfriend and he did, but then there's videos of her talking about what an amazing boyfriend he was while they were together, about how we stayed with her in the hospital and slept by her bed and it's like, and she's also. She had a bunch of host of mental illnesses that she described in their video about like not being able to drive down the street with the windows open because she was worried that germs are going to get in her car and some of those she recovered from and some of them she didn't like. It's an. There's another problem with people when it comes to when they're talking about things, they might not even be lying. They just might be. They just might have a distorted perception of reality. That is another problem with human beings when it comes to any sort of interaction between two people, especially after

Speaker 3:          01:18:44       breakup. I think the way that a person can view the time they spent with someone can very much change based on their current situation or how that breakup.

Speaker 4:          01:18:51       One hundred percent. Yeah, but on both sides. The real problem though is what we were saying is that human beings, it's very difficult. I can't read minds. You can't read minds. You can't look into memories. So we're relying on a person's description and then we have to rely on what we know about them, what, how, how, what, what, what we know about their ability to describe things accurately, what we know about their perceptions of reality are delusions there, there, there, there, there. Clarity. So fucking super tricky.

Speaker 3:          01:19:26       Yeah. I mean, my rule of thumb, what I would say to people is, unless you know the two people, I don't think you can ever really know what happened. So in that case of say you leave and Jamie tells you, I said something about you, you're probably going to go with Jamie, right? Because you know him.

Speaker 4:          01:19:40       Sam is a little crazy. I might. I might go. Yeah, I mean it's for sure if I didn't know you and Jamie told me you did something fucked up, I would side with Jane, but even that's weird if I'm not there or if I don't know. If you say I didn't do anything, I'm like, well maybe one day you'll be my best friend and maybe one day Jamie turned out to be a fucking psycho. I was like, remember when we used to think was okay, he's crazy, but

Speaker 3:          01:20:08       that's the thing too. I think sometimes with. I do empathize with some women who say if this happens to the men and people say, well that's a nice guy. I know that guy. That's my buddy. I've known him forever, but you didn't date him, so how do you know?

Speaker 4:          01:20:19       You don't know, right? Yeah. You don't know. God Damn it. It's fucking tricky. You know, if you ever seen that episode of black, do you ever watch Black Mirror

Speaker 3:          01:20:29       one episode? So everyone tells me how amazing this show is and I think it is amazing. But I saw one episode that really freaked me out. So. No, it was the one about. It was actually about a boy who was a pedophile and then he was being watched and blackmailed creeped me out.

Speaker 4:          01:20:45       I didn't watch that one, but there's one called crocodile. Okay. And it is easily the most disturbing episode of a television show I've ever watched in my life and it, it has to do with technology that allows people to read memories. Okay. And I'll leave it at that. So no spoiler alerts here, but until it is fucking dark stays with you after this one. Does this one's dark. I mean, I mean I can't, I can't, I will give too much away if I talk about it. But the concept is that you can, they have a machine and they set this machine up and through this machine they can literally read your memories until that happens. We really don't know. And you know, there's been things in my life where I looked back on it and I had a perception and then I went to the place where I grew up and I was like, I don't remember it looking like this.

Speaker 4:          01:21:39       I don't remember this being so close. Oh, the streets right here, this is where the house is. Oh, and then you have to kind of like remap your memory. So like, okay, we got to clean these memories up and try to figure out what's accurate and what's not. But then this, this, I'm just talking about like this, the neighborhood where I grew up in, but what about your adding in emotions? Then you add again, painful emotions because breakups and perhaps suicidal thoughts and time going by also time. Sure. I mean it's been absolutely proven that eye witness testimony is the least accurate piece of evidence that any investigator can ever use in terms of like trying to figure out what happened at the scene of a crime or anything involving any sort of trauma. It's fucking hard with people's minds.

Speaker 3:          01:22:26       Yeah, and I mean when we look at say the issue with me too in the sexual assault, sexual harassment, that I think also some people see this and they think I want to help this person so they might reinterpret their situation a way to say, you know, I also want to help this person. Well, I think

Speaker 4:          01:22:42       there's clearly without doubt, been a lot of unchecked sexual harassment in the workplace. Just I, I've always said this and this is not to say that men and women shouldn't work together. Now I'm not saying that any stretch, I just want to get that of way really quick, but when men and women do work together, they're around each other all day and people are sexually attracted to each other and

Speaker 2:          01:23:06       men are gross and it's just like this guy that I was having this conversation with today, we're talking about that. I was like, could you imagine being a girl and working in an office and God's trying to fuck you all the time and there was saying stupid shit to you when you try and get coffee and like we were talking about gay guys and he was saying like, do you ever. When he was in the military, would you have a problem with gay people? And it was really funny. He goes, he goes, I would want to see if I was working with a gay guy, I'd want them to like me because that way he tried to impress me and he'd do his job better and he'd be real nice to me and we were laughing about it, but it was like, okay, that's true, but if you run a gay guy that was always trying to fuck you and like maybe touched your ass when you bent over to pick up some paper or something like that, like that would get real annoying and if your job relied on this guy liking you and approving you, which a lot of women's jobs rely on, creeps liking them and approving it gets fucking disgusting.

Speaker 2:          01:24:01       That's the reality that many women have lived with for decades. I know that. Yeah, this is. This is going to shift. I'm hoping. I'm hoping that the. Even with the, the, the far reaching aspects of it were all men are trash. I'm hoping it's the Ty's gonna just sort of settle back in and it's going to, instead of being over this way, it's going to come back over this way and just balance out in the middle of a little bit and we'll get a better understanding of each other.

Speaker 6:          01:24:28       Yeah, that's my hope too, and I mean I, I hope that there's not so much damage done that's, you know, fixable at that point because of damage. Well, that you will see. I feel men nowadays are terrified interact with women, especially in the workplace.

Speaker 2:          01:24:44       I think you should be careful anyway. I think we're all way too casual about getting intimate with people and I've been guilty of it myself and my life at many times, but I think you should get to know people a little bit better. The promise people are horny and they're like, ah, I get it. I get you. Oh you gave me, hey, let's do this. You know, and that's, that's a real problem. And then you hook up with crazy people or you have to keep working with them after. Yeah. That's even worse. People that have inter office relationships, I know, I know people who work in offices where it's tricky, forbidden, like you're not allowed, and then and then I'm like, well, okay, but what if you fall in love with someone in the office or if they're the perfect person for you got to quit your job. Yeah.

Speaker 6:          01:25:22       I don't like businesses imposing that. I think people should be able to make those decisions be tricky. Decision never date anybody at work and I say that well, but I don't know. Married? No, not married. Okay.

Speaker 2:          01:25:35       You have a boyfriend and no. Okay. What if you met a guy that you worked with and he was fucking amazing and he was single and you're single and you guys just got along great and he was respectful and he's intelligent. He's funny and he's interesting and you liked doing things with them.

Speaker 6:          01:25:55       There are lots of men in this world. Who the fuck out of here? This is not. That's not true. There are so many men in this world. Why is it this one person work with is the only one who's going to be a match for me. He's the only one you've ever met. It's like that. I don't think so. I mean, but the thing is I'm very career oriented, so that could be part of why in my mind. Well that's Joel. That's a racist. It's racist to say that Asians are determined, but in, in that way, I guess I'm a little bit more risk averse. I'm not gonna jeopardize potentially jeopardize my career over a person that I meet that I like.

Speaker 2:          01:26:27       What if he was wanting to quit his job? Well

Speaker 6:          01:26:31       then he just did what we could talk, but we, I'd be like, you're gonna you're gonna quit your job for a woman. I don't know. You fucking loser. What are you gonna do if we have kids? Yeah,

Speaker 2:          01:26:40       yeah. Um, I see both sides, but then I see, okay, now imagine being a woman who works in the office with this guy who's in love with this woman. And then they have a relationship and then all of a sudden her career starts doing a little bit better.

Speaker 6:          01:26:54       That's the thing. I know other women will. Women like me say, well wait, we're not sleeping with people to get to the top. Is that fair?

Speaker 2:          01:27:01       Well, that is the world of the actress. It is and that is the world of the casting couch and this is the seat. This is the not so secret aspect of the casting couch that many, many, many people are aware of is that these women, fuck some of these men and we're not talking about rape. We're talking about women who chose to engage in willing full sex with people who were fractional. Yes, transactional stuff. Great. Great way to put it. There's a lot of women who I know who are actresses who were approached for by some certain types of men who were producers or executives in certain ways and they've said no, and then girls that they know said yes and their careers advanced. Yeah, and this was a thing where people were aware of it. It's, there's a power dynamic that exists when there's a boss and then there's an underling is a person who's working for that boss and whether it's a a producer and an actress or whether it's a CEO and an employee, when they engage in some sort of a transactional sexual relationship that makes everyone fucking uncomfortable. Yeah,

Speaker 6:          01:28:13       but how do you stop that you think? Do you think it's the industry's job or where do you weed that out?

Speaker 2:          01:28:19       I think corporations pretty much across the board now, just fire people when they do that. There was a recent CEO of some large high profile company who had a step down because he was involved in a consensual sexual relationship with somebody. Do you remember who that was? It was real big. Something super recent, but it was. There was no crime, but it was consensual sexual relationship with someone who worked for him. Was it Intel? Intel's. Yeah, that people. They're around each other all day long. I like you. Think about it. If you go home, say if you work eight hours a day and it takes you an hour to drive to work an hour, drive home, that's fucking 10 hours and nobody eight hours a day. If you really want to make it right, you were nine and 10, so it's like half the day's gone. You get home, you're exhausted, you know your husband's exhausts, you're staring each other, you're together like three or four hours.

Speaker 2:          01:29:13       You have a meal, you go to sleep, you get up in the morning, you'd go do it again. You're with those people at work more than you're even with the people that you live with, you know that's really, and that's your waking hours. By the time you get home, you fucking tired and if you go to the gym afterwards, we'll. There's an hour and a half gone there. You might see each other for an hour a night now, and especially if people are single, I mean obviously it's a little bit easier for that to happen as well. Yeah. It becomes a big part of your social interaction mean how many people there. Their social circle is primarily the people that they work with. Real common, right? So, I mean, I think if it's a consensual relationship, there shouldn't be anything wrong there, but I can see how in this climate there are all these other ways of looking at it being imposed on it.

Speaker 2:          01:30:01       So is that really consensual? If it's someone who is your boss, but then imagine say if you and Jamie work together. Okay. And you guys had a consensual sexual relationship and you both were on the same level. You both in does not. It's not like anybody has any power, but then you break up, you know, and then Jamie comes over to me, he's like a fucking asshole connection and then you come to me and you know, like Jamie though he looks like a good guy, but when you start dating him, he's a fucking selfish prick. And then leave that at home. Dad. Well it's definitely becomes a problem in the workforce when you, you're, you're not just friends. Friends is fine, but when you start having sex with each other, that's when things get crazy. You know? Very few people are able to separate sex and emotions with friendship.

Speaker 2:          01:30:50       Very, very few people. That's probably. That's one of the things that's admirable, but these people that are willing to have these open relationships, it's like, whoa. Like you can. I know guys like hang out with other guys who fuck their girlfriend. I'm like, Jesus, you're a better man than me. Well, some of them like that though. Like if they're masochistic, they liked the idea of they're a woman being having sex with another guy. What you didn't want to use the word Cook. I like how you went with masochistic. I guess that's a technical term. Two, we can call them cooks. Cook is compromised word though, isn't it? There's a whole other stuff that comes with that. Yeah, it gets squirrely. I thought it always meant that it. It always meant cuckold like you want to watch men have sex with your wife, but then it got to where. What is it? What is what? The. What is the Beta male? The Beta male, but there's so many different versions of it now. It's become really freely tossed around like a beach ball at a concert is throwing cukor around these days. That's fine if that's what you're into. No judgment there.

Speaker 2:          01:32:00       Yeah. It's into being cuckolded yeah. If that's what you're into. Good luck with that. Okay. Cook a man who is desperate for acceptance, approval, and affection from women.

Speaker 1:          01:32:14       Oh, now it's different.

Speaker 2:          01:32:17       This desperation has lead to the compromise of his beliefs and values to desecration of his dignity and self worth and this inability to stand up for himself. This four Chan, right? This and what he deserves as a human being. Example, loyalty, fidelity, and honesty in a romantic relationship. Okay. Okay. Look at it. Look at the example they gave. Hold on a second. I know John's always wanted a girlfriend, but since him and Mary started dating, he's become a cook. She spends all of his money and flirts openly without openly with other men. I can tell it bothers him, but he's so afraid of losing her that he doesn't say anything.

Speaker 1:          01:33:00       That's a cook.

Speaker 2:          01:33:02       Sounds like a male feminist also. I can't believe you went there. I don't. Yeah. That male feminist thing. I've, I've known a few that were real creeps that were fake creeps, you know, they're like on the side, they, they, what they were doing was there

Speaker 1:          01:33:22       there

Speaker 2:          01:33:23       posturing as an alternative to these men who don't want monogamous relationships or would break the woman's heart or not willing to compromise and bend to the will of the woman and that they put these women on a platform and worship these women and I am the alternative and I'm the powerful alternative and these men are assholes, and then they try to shit on those men and take the, but all it does is make those men appear even more attractive to these women. Secretly. These men, these feminists men and these women have these weird relationships where it doesn't work and they're never sexual or sexual. The women aren't really sexually attracted to them, so they withhold sex and it just. It gets super weird. Obviously. I just generalized a lot about a giant group of people's relationships, but what I've seen, it's just

Speaker 1:          01:34:15       it's they,

Speaker 2:          01:34:17       they don't run fast. They can't pick things up. They're not attractive, so they tried it. They're a little weasels. They're trying to find another way in.

Speaker 3:          01:34:23       Yeah, I mean, I think men who, not all men who call themselves feminists are male feminists, so in that I think men who ascribed to women being equal at, that's a good thing and I think a lot of guys will say, yeah, I'm feminists because they think that's the right thing to do. That's the socially acceptable thing and that's the way we should be. But then the ones who run around and say, you know, really, really push it and make that their identity and really sell themselves as male feminists. Those were the guys I have an issue with because like you said, they're sneaky and they know what they're doing. They're not being honest.

Speaker 2:          01:34:58       Well, you can almost always tell you, you see them, you know, there they're a type, you know, they're just, they're an unattractive type. They're not attractive to women. And to try to figure out a way like, how am I going to do this? What's it going to be the way you've got to figure out a way to stand out. This is the way I'm going to just what? What are these women want to hear? They want to hear that. I'm going to say that egalitarian. Great. You know, someone who believes in equality is great, but as soon as you establish your proclaiming yourself to be more interested in the opposite gender and more supportive of them, then males and even though you are a male, hm. That should be a red flag. That's a giant red flag. You should be into humans. I like people.

Speaker 2:          01:35:47       I like people I like. I'm gay. Like I'm straight. I like people. I like when they're Nice, nice to me. I'm nice to you. That's what I like. I don't want you to get discriminated against in any way, shape or form, but I don't want to pretend that one group is better than other groups except Asians when it comes to Harvard. The crazy thing is with these guys though, you see there's been a trend where they actually have a lot to hide and they usually are misogynistic and they usually do abuse. Women was the scary thing. I think what happens is there's a certain amount of resentment that from living this fake life and having these fake beliefs and doing so just to get through the approval of women, you know, and then when it doesn't work out, there's anger, resentment, and this is just.

Speaker 2:          01:36:32       I think some guys put it on because it's a way of overcompensating for their own guilt. Yeah, that's true too. Probably. Yeah. There's probably a lot of different reasons why men become feminists and very few of them are good unless they're just. Their idea of what it means is different than my idea what it means. My idea. It means a little bit, that little sneaky fuck. That's my idea. You know when I. Because I've just seen so many of them, it's like, look, I'm sure some bank robbers are really romantic, interesting poets who just decide this is a great way to make money. There's got to be one, you know, but most of them are fucking criminals. Right. And this is like how I feel about male feminists. Like I'm sure there's a bunch of them out there that are really good guys and maybe through the influence of the people that have been around, they've chosen to identify as a male feminist and this seems to be a good way to show that they support women and even if they have to support women over men, look at women have been fucked over for so long.

Speaker 2:          01:37:30       I'm more than willing to do that and they do it with good intentions. That's entirely possible, but a lot of it are creepy little dudes that are trying to get laid and they they're not attractive to women, so they try to figure out a way to become attractive to women and they don't have the confidence to just go, well, aren't we all equal? Aren't we all just all humans are. We're all different. We're working on yourself to make yourself more attractive to it instead of deceiving them. One of my all time favorite tweets that I read was the guy saying, I'm not going to describe myself as a feminist until women tell me that I'm doing feminism correctly. He's like more feminist than regular feminists. He's like, so feminist, you can't be a feminist to women. Tell me I'm a feminist mistress, Mr [inaudible], please tell me. He's. That dude has got a ball gag on right now. He's like tightening a down.

Speaker 2:          01:38:21       He's putting himself in the shack also, but then there's women like that too. There's women that pretend to be one of the guys like that girl is always the one of the guy's girl it though other guys can tell when a male, when a guy's not sincere about being a male feminist and the same with girls can tell. Oh yeah, you know the big red flag with girls, girls who don't have girlfriends, they're just friends with guys. I get along with guys better. Yeah, but you do. I had a friend of mine who's, who's dating a girl like that and she. All she had was male friends. I was like, dude, I'm like, get out now. Like this is not gonna work. So tell me what does that mean? Girls don't like? Her girls don't trust or you can't find any girls. Yeah, that's crazy.

Speaker 2:          01:39:17       That is crazy. I'm not saying you shouldn't have some guy friends, but all your friends are guys. Yeah, that's a red flag. No, I would agree with that. And any guy, you have a straight guy and all his friends are girls know a fuck is happening. Right? We just don't get along with guys. Guys are assholes. I don't like the where they talk about women. Oh, okay. All of them. All of them do. Come on. Where are you hanging out dude? You don't like any guys. Seems Weird. So what did your friend do? Oh, he got fucked around on. Yeah, she was fucking all those guys. I was going to say, of course mean the writing's on the wall. Yeah. It was ugly to the way it went down. It's like woo. But that's how it is. People. People are always trying to find their way in like, what's what's, what's my way to get the most acceptance, my way to get the most happiness my way.

Speaker 2:          01:40:17       And I mean, it's fairly unrelated, but not necessarily to what we're talking about, about gender dysphoria, about some people choosing that as a path to get a lot of attention. I mean, I think there's many things that people do to get a lot of attention. There's things that people do to stand out as typically unique, right? Like dye their hair pink or purple or blue or wear certain things or do certain piercings and just things that people do to like get attention and fit in and find their niche and just do something where it makes them feel like they have some clout in this community

Speaker 4:          01:40:54       of humans.

Speaker 6:          01:40:55       Yeah. It helps them find other people too who are like them. Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          01:40:58       And also like, it's, they're signaling to each other, we're all equal. We're, or we're all similar. We're all, we're all in this kind of clan. We're outsiders,

Speaker 6:          01:41:07       you know, it's fascinating. And I'm all for that. I'm all for people finding each other and self expression. It's only when it is having negative implications for other people, that's when it's a problem. Oh, for sure. Yeah. Yeah. That's,

Speaker 4:          01:41:21       yeah. When, when it's not just a bunch of people finding each other, but a bunch of people looking at the other people and attacking them for not being similar, but that's one of the things people do to sort of affirm their identity, right? You attack the people that oppose that identity or

Speaker 6:          01:41:39       people that are different to people need to do that though. I wish they didn't, but they do so often

Speaker 4:          01:41:45       wonder like objectively, if you were from another planet and you were watching these patterns take place. Here you go, wow. This creepy little organism like this weird thing that it does.

Speaker 6:          01:41:54       Yeah. Going back to the transgender, uh, bullying. I guess my issue with, uh, with all of that intimidation is the fact that these kids are not getting the help that they need. And so if we look at something like I was saying earlier about if it's a little boy who says he's a girl, he's likely going to grow up to be a gay man. You can't say that now. And so all of the scientific research suggests that all the studies ever done suggest that. But you can't say that because it really upsets transgender activists and so you have all these children now are transitioning who I think in five, 10 years are going to regret it. Isn't this sort of similar to what we're talking about earlier is that historically

Speaker 4:          01:42:35       trans people have been so discriminated against that it shifted so hard the other way that it's gone the other way, like just when we were talking about in terms of sexism and harassment in the workplace and sexual harassment and rape, so was so one sided that now it's pushing the opposite way. Like I read a tweet once by this woman had said, here's an unpopular opinion, and she was an editor of a magazine. Sure. Here's an unpopular opinion. I'm not even remotely concerned with men being falsely accused of sexual harassment or assault and she was attacked. Bret Weinstein retweeted it and pointed out how wrong this idea was and how crazy it is to to take allies who are falsely accused of sexual harassment or assault and not being concerned about that. Like you're, you're only concerned with your own gender and this is a. This is a perfect example of an intelligent person that's thinking in this really crazy, discriminatory way because in her mind, her team had been fucked over so many times that it's time to fuck over that other team. If we lose a couple of people, hey, we shoot some drones into some apartment buildings and a few civilians die. At least we got the terrorists.

Speaker 6:          01:43:50       Yeah, and I mean I understand

Speaker 3:          01:43:52       that like the anger that comes with that. I think for the people who were the most militant, so not to say that have this particular person, but I think of women in particular who are the most militant about this movement. I think they really just have been hurt badly by men and it's a way for them to express that,

Speaker 4:          01:44:06       but you can't say that no. These women that are angry about men, that they've been hurt by men, so now they discriminate against large groups of men because of that pain. If you do that, like you're. You're a self hate or your.

Speaker 3:          01:44:22       Yeah, internalized misogyny, which is sad. I mean, but you can't actually argue with it.

Speaker 4:          01:44:30       Where does this balance out though? Does it balance out to a point in our children's future, our children's Children's future where this is no longer a concern, like cannibalism is no longer a concern or a very, very slight concern where it's an aberration, where it's a very, very rare thing. I mean is that's the ultimate goal, right? Is that we reach a point in our society where we do not care if someone's gay, we got care. If you're a girl, we do not care if you're a boy and we're not mad if you're not attracted to us or I mean that would be a wonderful thing, right? If we get to a point where people are just comfortable in their own skin,

Speaker 3:          01:45:12       you mean this craziness, like where is it eventually going to leave?

Speaker 4:          01:45:15       Yes. I mean culturally across the board, whether it's male versus female, whether it's transverse a straight, all of this gay versus straight. Whether it's progressive versus conservative. I would love it if we got to this point with all this chaos and calamity and arguing back and forth. It would be fantastic if we can get to a balance point.

Speaker 3:          01:45:37       Yeah. No, I agree and I do think we're coming up to that point because more and more I see people are saying that they're not okay with this in terms of the things I write about. People reach out to me and say, you know what? I'm so glad you said that. I agree with you. Even the response to wrong speak. I really thought that people were going to lose their minds in terms of the things that we said, but you know, it's been very positive feedback. So I think more people then you might think are actually on board with, you know, wanting to come to a middle ground and they're not okay with this. The extreme craziness that we're seeing. So I think that's a good sign. It's just a matter of waiting it out.

Speaker 4:          01:46:15       I hope you're right. And I hope that we understand why things get extreme and that as human beings we can look at it with compassion and say like you were saying like women that are so angry against men, it's not just because for no reason something had to happen to them. Like I had a friend and who's not an attractive man, and over the time that I knew him, he became more and more resentful to women to the point where he would just openly say fucked up misogynistic

Speaker 2:          01:46:50       things about women. And it was weird to watch, but it was, it was one of those things where I was like, oh, I see he associates women with paint in. He associates them with just wanting his money or trying to fuck him over and this is his perception. This is how he looks at women. Like, oh, okay, I get it. Which is sad, you know? And in that case, women obviously not all women are like that. Just like not all men are the men that these women have encountered in life. And you can't generalize from one person to everybody. No, you can't. But when we look at it with compassion, I mean the hopefully the healthy people, the people that aren't in that state of anger and resentment, that they look at it with compassion. They go, oh, okay, I see why this woman would write that tweet. She's met a bunch of fucked up shitty dudes, probably male feminists, right?

Speaker 5:          01:47:45       Yeah. And that she doesn't need to be mobbed over her tweet either

Speaker 2:          01:47:47       trust. No men. Yeah, or man. Yeah. That kind of shit. It's like, okay, I get, I get where that's from. I just think there's entirely too much conflict out there, but

Speaker 5:          01:48:00       you know, I think our society almost thrives on it. I would say the media definitely thrives on it because if you're not angry and upset about something, what are people going to do mean? Look at twitter, social media to facebook's the best because facebook, those assholes are allowed to write fucking forever wraps, paragraphs of bullshit, like swear. Do they have jobs? Some of these people I click on, the more you click on the more thing and then there's way more, way too much. I think there's just going to be a two lines, but it's like six pages. Yeah. I think that, that,

Speaker 2:          01:48:33       that is a real problem and I think one of the more unique things about twitter is that it limited you to 140 characters and then people complained. So they gave you to 80.

Speaker 5:          01:48:42       No, that's too much. Sometimes I can't read all that. Sorry. It was. Well, as a comic,

Speaker 2:          01:48:48       1:40 was great because it made you really, um, it made you really invest in the economy of words. You really had to make sure that you got your point out as quickly as possible. It's great for joke writing because you can just set a Duh Duh Duh Duh Duh Duh Duh Duh Duh Duh. It's the, it's a good way to like really trim down the fat and your jokes, but it's not a good way to express ideas. And that's one of the good things about twitter is they have this thing where you can reply to your tweet and then reply to that, reply to that thread. And they all fit in together. I liked that, but I don't like it sometimes because sometimes people just fucking drone on.

Speaker 5:          01:49:26       Um, and on and on. And this, you know, this is a first draft to edit this shit. Bitch is too much nonsense in there. You don't get that with your dms to that. People just send you a massive block of. I don't read them. I've, I've, I barely skim through my day. I can't. I follow too many people. One of the good is I get a

Speaker 2:          01:49:47       lot of interesting things in my feed. One of the bad things. I'll get 500 dms a day. I can't do that.

Speaker 6:          01:49:54       I saw someone wrote a tweet that said if, if my, if you don't like write two sentences for the DM, I'm not going to read it. And that was their pin tweet.

Speaker 2:          01:50:02       Wow. That's aggressive. I read as many as I can. I just can't read them all. There's no way. Yeah. It just, it's like you can't reply to everybody either. Like people say, welcome your reply to my app mentions I can't.

Speaker 6:          01:50:14       Yeah. And you can't like, like all of their stuff either.

Speaker 2:          01:50:17       No, it's too many. It's too many boss. I don't want to read people's stuff. It's just I don't have. You don't have the time. And also if you're running the risk of encountering too much negativity and and then also things that you disagree with that you want to like, oh, I should say that's bullshit. That's not true. I'm going to tell this guy. This is what actually happened. Yeah. You don't even know history. I don't want to do that. I don't want to argue with people about random facts or science or anything. I'll look at it and I'm like, okay, this is.

Speaker 6:          01:50:48       But you've. Have you been mobbed before? You have what's been the worst?

Speaker 2:          01:50:52       Oh, one of the big ones was a about a trans fighter. I remember that. Yeah, that was a hilarious one because I'm like, you guys can kiss my fucking ass. You're out of your mind. You guys are out of your mind. If you think that a man who has been a man for 30 years and has taken female hormones for two is the same. You put Brock Lesnar, chop his dick off and put them in a dress. That guy's gonna Maul through the women's heavyweight division like nothing you've ever seen in your life because we're built different and it's just a fact and then they want to tries to argue that it's crazy and there are. There's certainly standouts in terms of women who are a much more muscular, higher bone density, particularly African American women have very high bone density, but there's a different shape to their hips.

Speaker 2:          01:51:40       There's A. There's the size of the hands, the size of the shoulders. Things are different. That also the imprinting of years and years of testosterone. It's just. There was a great article by this. I'm board certified endocrinologist who went over all of the, all the things that separate men from women which should exclude them from competing in combat sports against women and this woman was called a transphobic and she's a fucking endocrinologists idiot. She's talking about the science and she's also talking about the science of. One of the things they talk about is how women, you know, or a trans woman. Once they transitioned to being a woman there basically biologically almost exactly the same as woman. She was like, no, not only that, but the bone density is retained by taking estrogen, which is what the problem with women when they have osteoporosis, they they lose. They're losing estrogen, they lose bone mass. Well, the estrogen actually helps you retain bone mass, so when a man transitions to a woman and then starts

Speaker 4:          01:52:46       taking estrogen, it's actually helping retain the bone mass that he would have lost by not having testosterone, and then on top of that reaction times that Rita reaction times are several tenths of a second faster in general for women than they are for you or for men rather than they are for even professional athlete. Women saw these. All these variables that need to be taken into consideration when you're allowing someone to do a sport and that we're not just talking about bike racing, we're not talking about something where someone noncontact. We're talking about the most contact. We're talking about fucking fighting. There's there's benefits that certain people have. There's, there's physical attributes that pe, there's variables inside the genders right there. There's some men that have gigantic physical advantages over other men and all of those are taking into you, you, you, there's no, like even playing field when it comes to even enter gender competition or, or you know, male versus male competition.

Speaker 4:          01:53:47       There's no real level playing field. So the best we can do is say, okay, well you guys got to be the same weight. You know what, let's just make that, make it the same weight and that's as close as you can get. But, but even in that, there's people that are just physically, they're just, they're just going to be better. There's no, there's no getting around it. There's going to be better athletes. There's, they're going to have better genetics. You know, there's nothing you do about that. But one thing we can do is we can keep women from getting beaten up by men and, and men who transitioned to being women. And if you think that's fair, you're fucking crazy and it's just not. It just doesn't make any sense. And the arguments for it are so shitty. And so there are so riddled with progressive speak that they're trying to pretend that this is a woman.

Speaker 4:          01:54:32       Now, this is not a woman. This is a trans woman, this is a male. She has a y chromosome. She transitioned to being a female. Now she's a trans woman, and if you choose to fight her and you're a woman and you know that she's a trans woman, I'm totally fine with that. But that was not what was going on here. What was going on here was this woman who used to be a man for 32 years, transitioned to being a woman and it didn't tell anybody and thought to different women who thought they were fighting a woman and got fucking smashed watching it. It was like watching a man fight a woman. That's what I was watching. I was like, this isn't like particularly. She wasn't particularly skillful. It wasn't like she had some unbelievable background in judo, like Rhonda Rousey or something like that.

Speaker 4:          01:55:18       It wasn't that he would just literally watching a former man beat up women who never had the the benefit of 30 years plus of testosterone in their body. What do you think the solution should be then? I don't know, but I was fascinated by watching the mob come after me for that one. I was like, this is adorable. What was fascinating about it was, here's something I. I mean, I'm not a physio. I'm not a real expert in physiology or endocrinology, but I'm a martial arts expert and I've been doing it my whole life. Like I know the difference I've. I've trained with women world champions and watch them get mauled by men who are not very good. It's just a fact, especially when it comes to striking, you know, there's more of a gap in Jujitsu or the gap rather closes in Jujitsu because skill and technique take precedent over physical strength, but God dammit when it comes to striking, you could get a man who's been doing it for six months but just happens to have a lot of fast twitch muscle fiber and it just knows how to hit things hard and he he'll fuck a woman up.

Speaker 4:          01:56:31       It's not good, especially when it comes to kickboxing and kicking and punching. There's so. There's so many advantages and to to say that those advantages are immediately cut out of the picture. As soon as you transitioned to being a woman and within two years he should be able to fight women in a cage and not tell them, you're a woman. I was like, this is insanity. Yeah, so that was the. That was the big mob that came after me. I think it's interesting that in this, because it is pitting people who would call themselves feminist against transgender activists. Basically women are being lost in the mix, so you can't say certain things like on what planet would it be okay for someone who is born male to fight a woman, but in this case, because this person who was born male identifies as female, you can't call that into question it and it also, there was a real problem in Texas, the other way where they're there, what they were doing as being prejudice against trans people to the point where they wouldn't let a girl transitioning to being a boy wrestle with boys.

Speaker 4:          01:57:32       They made her wrestle with girls while she was taking testosterone. Like, you guys are out of your fucking mind like you. You're not even recognizing that she wants to compete with boys, which is a disadvantage for her or him. Now let him compete with boys because this is a different thing, but then even then a lot of boys are saying, well look, I'm not taking testosterone. I just have testosterone. Would have her testosterone is higher than my testosterone because she's taking exogenous testosterone. This is kind of crazy. Like, yeah, it's. There's a lot of new ground that's going on here. My concern as a martial arts expert is when you are using ideology to push this, this progressive notion that, you know, a trans woman is exactly the same as a woman and you're getting women beat the fuck up because of it and this is what I felt and this is what I saw and they wouldn't have to be hard for like a year or two, but then it all went away.

Speaker 4:          01:58:35       What's the worst thing they said about you? I didn't read it. I didn't read it. I read a little bit of it and then I was like, oh, I really didn't even hurt my feelings because it was like, this is so stupid. It's like, do you know a woman who's got a hand that looks like that? Find one, find one. Because if I took estrogen, I'd still have these and that's not fair. It's just not. I don't care. I don't care what anybody says. It's just not. I mean, even a woman with big hands, they're not that big. They're not like brock Lesnar's hands is that there's a difference. There's a fucking difference. There's a difference in the shape of the jaw, the difference in. So there's so many differences in men to women and there's so many women that used to be men that transition to being women that are now dominating these sports.

Speaker 4:          01:59:19       Are these women feel like they're being fucked over like weightlifting. There was this Australian weightlifter who is a trans woman who's competing as a woman and his fucking breaking records left and right. And everybody's like, this is crazy. She's an inspiration. Yeah. No, she's a guy. She used to be a guy and now she's breaking these women's records. Like, what are we doing? This is crazy. Yeah. But to play devil's advocate, please do fox get beaten by Ashley Smith because she sucks. That's really what it is. Ashley. Evan Smith is good. She's so good. She listened. There's a lot of women that would be a lot of men and women who are not taking anything, who would beat a lot of men. And it's happened. I'm a Germane to random me who, uh, was a super high level. Women's MMA fighter is a 145 pound world title beat.

Speaker 4:          02:00:20       Holly Holm. She fought a man and a kickboxing bout, knocked him out. It's because she's a fucking beast. She's really good and really technical, super strong and just much better than a guy who wasn't on her level, but she's just super exceptional. But there's also women who fought men who were world champions who got knocked down, who there was a woman from. God Damn it, she was a female boxer from Holland. Her name escapes me right now. Um, she was, she was a woman that they were always trying to match her up with Christy Martin back when Christy Martin, the coal miner's daughter was a famous, God dammit. Why can't I remember her name? But she was an elite female boxer and she got knocked out by a man. It was ugly. And the guy, she knocked out, the guy who knocked her out really wasn't very good.

Speaker 4:          02:01:13       He just climbed her on the John and killed her. But it was disturbing to watch, but somehow wasn't disturbing with Jermaine to random. He knocked out the guy. Then it was like, yeah, girl, I'm the, you can't, you're always going to have people that are higher level skill and Ashley Evan Smith, who's competed successfully in the UFC, she's very tough and she beat Fox and that this, you know, I'm not against fallon, Fox fighting women that want to fight her. I'm not against that. If they want. I'm not against women fighting men to want to do. I'm not a man. I'm not against people riding bulls. I'm not against people bungee jumping. I should be able to do whatever fuck you want, but don't pretend that you're exactly the same as a biological woman. Well, why the fuck do we have tests? Then what? Why? What is it?

Speaker 4:          02:02:04       What is a chromosome? What our genetics, what are, what is it? Is it all? We're just going to give it all away for ideology. And what about women? Like what is this idea of being completely progressive and and looking at things and promoting equality. That's wonderful. But are you promoting equality for women? Like what about the women? What about a woman like you? What about a woman who's a slight thin? What do, what are you supposed to do? How much do you weigh? I'm not going to tell you. You're very sad. Let's pretend you're in the hundred and five pound weight class. Do you feel like you can compete with 100, five pound man and. No, that seems. That seems ridiculous, right? Well, it seems to me that we have to accept the fact that there's some physical differences when the consequences are being gravely injured and this is what martial arts are all about.

Speaker 4:          02:02:55       I'm trying to hurt you and I shouldn't have natural physical advantages that come from having a y chromosome and 30 plus years of testosterone in my body. That just seems to be obvious to me and I didn't understand why, but that was a hill that I was ready to die on. I was like, you guys can fuck off. Good for you for that, but you see that they've kind of left you alone now, right? Because I do this because I [inaudible] I can say things like this about it and I think because it makes sense because when other people hear about it that are rational people, they go, what? What's happening? Wait a minute, that's a guy. She was a guy for 30 years. Like, that's not right. And the vast majority of people who even support trans rights, including friends of mine who are trans or with me on this, they're like, yeah, that's crazy. Have you heard the term turf? Uh, my surf and turf

Speaker 6:          02:03:47       terp no. Turf is in t e R, F is trans. Exclusionary. Radical feminist. So this is a new slur that's being used against women who will say trans women or not women because they were not born women,

Speaker 4:          02:04:02       trans exclusionary, radical feminist

Speaker 6:          02:04:04       kind of be a turf in this situation because you are advocating for women and the safety of women and saying that people who are born male but identify as female are not the same as people who are born female.

Speaker 4:          02:04:16       Yes. But that doesn't mean that I'm discriminatory. No, it's a word that they use to try and discredit you. Good luck, have fun with that. I don't care see this problem, but the thing about this is I don't care because I really don't have any hate in my heart and I don't have any discrimination in my heart like I don't think most of us do. Well, I speak for everybody.

Speaker 6:          02:04:38       Some do, but

Speaker 4:          02:04:39       some do. I'm sure. I'm sure if you were Tryna look, if you have a thousand people and 100 of those people are a fucking asshole to you. It's gonna feel like a lot of people. Right? So if you're a trans person and you're, you're. I mean, I've seen horrific things written to trans people online. I've seen it, I've seen, I understand that it's real discrimination, but I understand that you have to understand, you have to appreciate who your actual allies and people who are rational people who actually care about you and who disagree with you. On one very particular thing, and this is the only place where I disagree, it's combat sports and it's because it's my area of expertise. I've been doing it since I was a kid. Like you can't tell me that there. There's not differences. I've watched men and women fight my whole life. I know there's a difference and I know that from talking to endocrinologist and people who are experts in the human anatomy, that there's just physiological differences that are insurmountable. You just are. I've seen men and women hit the bag. It's a very different thing.

Speaker 6:          02:05:42       Yeah, I mean I get where people are coming from, the people who are upset by this because I think by acknowledging someone that someone was not born the sex that they identify as. It's almost like saying, pointing out to them that they're different, but they are different. They are different. But I can see how that can be upsetting for someone who identifies as the opposite sex.

Speaker 4:          02:06:04       Yeah. You know what? I can see how it's upsetting. If you're short and you want to identify as being tall. You know what? If I wanted to pretend that I was seven feet tall and you'd be like, Joe, your five eight, like, are you an asshole? Why are you saying I'm a five eight? But you are. So if I say you're a trans woman, which means you're a born a man, you have a y chromosome, like where's you're a piece of Shit, how you point that out, but that's what you are. It's not that you're negative or you are people who are dwarves are is that. Is it evil to say that a dwarf is a dwarf or a little person and whatever, whatever phrase you want to use, are we supposed to acknowledge that there is an issue, like if someone is born with a handicap, are you supposed to.

Speaker 4:          02:06:47       Is that a fact? Are you allowed to discuss it as a fact if you have autism, my allowed to bring up the fact that you are on the spectrum or am I supposed to ignore it? Yeah. Is it discrimination? If you talk about reality, if someone has a deformity, are you allowed to discuss it or is it discrimination to discuss reality because what are we doing with our language? What are we doing with the way we describe the actual things that are that exist in the world and if we're not describing them in accurate terms because we're trying to somehow another stop people from getting hurt feelings, what are these feelings based on these delusional perceptions of reality and why are we reinforcing these delusional perceptions of reality? Because it seems to me that this kind of language in this kind of exclusionary th, th, the, the, the inability

Speaker 2:          02:07:36       to use certain words and the inability to describe things accurately, correctly, and in many cases scientifically it hurts everybody.

Speaker 6:          02:07:45       Yeah, I agree with that. I don't think facts themselves are hateful. I think people who use facts to justify discrimination, that's where the problem is and that's where the efforts should be going because when you start to deny facts, where does that leave you? Where do you draw the line in that case?

Speaker 2:          02:08:00       Absolutely, but I think it's, there's something that's kind of cool about it, that there are trans people and what's cool about it is that the world is weird. You know, and I'm, I'm not happy that they get a lot of hate, but I'm kinda happy that they exist. I wish they could just be women. I wish you could just hit a switch and you really wish you were born a woman. Bam, you're a woman. But I suspect that even if you could do that, some people would rather just be trans. Some people would look like there's a lot of people that I know that are trans and also have Dick's. Yeah. And they want to keep the deck. Yeah. And they're like, okay, like what's going on here? And you, you know, that you're transphobic if you're a straight heterosexual male and you're not willing to date a trans woman with a Dick,

Speaker 6:          02:08:48       but you know what it is, it's actually a sexual preference for four men who will date trans women who were. It's retaining their penis. That's what it's called, the literature. They decide not to get surgery. It's actually a particular sexual preference for the people that are attracted to that particular trans guy or morph affilia.

Speaker 2:          02:09:05       Whoa. Someone told Jim Norton. I'm nothing wrong with that either. No, nothing, nothing what either do what you do, but this is the thing, the difference between a man and a woman, a trans man, a trans woman, and then someone who could actually be a woman who transitions. I think we're going to get to a point within whether it's 100 years or 500 years where we can use things like the future version of crispr or whatever comes down the line next. Some scientific innovation that's going to allow people to literally transition. Yeah, I think it's gonna happen and when that happens, I suspect they're going to say that word again. What was the one guy named Andrew? More fulfilling? It's going to be a bunch of those. It's going to be a bunch of people like, man, I'd rather just stay at chick with a Dick.

Speaker 6:          02:09:56       I'll take it. Yeah. Well, again, Andrew more fulfilling is the preference for male to female people who have retained their penis. Fucking go for it. Yeah. Nothing wrong. It's all good. It's all good. It's only when you tell other men that you have to conform to this. I think that's where the problem is. I think people should be allowed to be into what they're into.

Speaker 2:          02:10:14       Yes, and the idea that you're transphobic, and I've seen this, I've seen articles written where they're shitting on men that are not willing to date women with penises. They call it the.

Speaker 6:          02:10:26       No, sorry, the cotton. The cotton ceiling is the other way around. When it's a male to female person and women don't want to date them. Lesbians

Speaker 5:          02:10:34       don't want to date them because they have a penis. What do they call it? The cotton ceiling because it's like the glass ceiling. Acceptance has to do with underwear. She's Christ. So lesbians who don't want to date trans women because penises. Yeah. What a wonderful world we live in. I like it. I liked it. This world is weird. I do. So this is where

Speaker 4:          02:10:57       I think I get why people would see what I've said and think that it's transphobic. I get like who I am. I get that, that it's a problem. I get just looking at me as a problem. I mean I'm, I'm, I'm a cage fighting commentator, you know, I'm a dirty standup comedian. This, I mean, I've seen like I would be your enemy,

Speaker 5:          02:11:25       but people shouldn't assume, right? Like you're your own person so you might look a certain way.

Speaker 4:          02:11:30       It's just what people do. It's the same way a guy looks at a chick with a Dick and goes, yikes, what do we got going on here? Let me just. I just think as me, as an individual, as a human being, one thing I like about it is I like things that are weird. I like things that defy the standard definition.

Speaker 5:          02:11:52       I'm the same. Think it's more interesting. It's far more interesting. Yeah. It's interesting when you talked to neuroscientists, whereas a playboy tee shirt, right? You're a Weirdo. Yeah. Do you like it? Yeah, it's cool. It's a cool, clever. You are a Weirdo. I am aware though for sure. And that relates to your sense of humor too though, because my sense of humor is really dry and I feel that's part of the way I look at the world and why I appreciate the world the way. Oh yeah. Oh, for sure. I embrace the weird.

Speaker 4:          02:12:20       Yes, I really do. I'd love it. I'd love that. Things are strange. I do. I think it's interesting. I really do. I think so. I think everything's interesting. I mean, I, I, and I try to cultivate that. I really do. I go out of my way to try to look at things with fresh eyes and especially because I smoke a lot of pot and so whenever I do that I kind of always have a new way of looking at it. Like, oh, I never even thought about it that way, but that's one of the things that are really like about marijuana. And I tried. I've tried to explain that to people that don't smoke pot. I got a conversation with Ted nugent about that and one of the things, because he had this perception that people smoke pot or lazy and Ne'er do wells. I'm like, dude, I can't have enough jobs. I have so many. I do do so many fucking super high functioning. I'm always doing something. I'm not lazy, but I get the benefit that I get out of it as a benefit. That is not often.

Speaker 4:          02:13:21       It's not, uh, it's not often promoted. And that benefit is there's something good about being nervous, there's something good about what people call paranoia is something good about heightened perspective that is brought upon by psychedelics or buy marijuana where you are forced to reexamine what you've taken for granted. And that's what I like about it. And so what I like about one of the things that I like about smoking pot, besides the fact that I believe it makes me more compassionate, it makes it instills a better sense of community. It makes me more friendly and more loving and it definitely does that, but it also makes me look at things with fresh eyes and appreciate the weirdness, the weird. Like I genuinely love it when I see like some girl. Do you know Bailey? Jay is a trans woman with a giant Dick. She got pictures of her Dick.

Speaker 4:          02:14:20       Is Jamie going to pull it up right now and think you can. We'll get kicked off of youtube. But I love it. I like the fact that it's real. It doesn't bother me. Happy. I think it's fun. Are you going to enjoy a more fulfilled? No, no I'm not. But I, I like the fact that they exist, I do acceptance and I like the fact that people liked them and I liked the fact that it makes certain people happy if it makes them happy or people that are attracted to them happy. I really do like it. I don't, uh, don't like definitions I don't like. I don't like restrictions, you know, so where people would get an incorrect assumption is my radical stance against this trans woman fighting other women because I recognize that as being unfair and not well because there's suppression of the debate as well.

Speaker 4:          02:15:13       Yeah. It's one thing if you could talk about it openly. Well, it's also something that I'm an expert in, so I'm like, stop, don't, don't, don't try to compare this to fucking tennis because even in tennis it wasn't fair, but this is a different thing. It just, it's a radically different thing. It's interesting because I heard you talk about this, I don't know if it was your interview with Josh Barnett, but when you first get into the cage, you don't know what the other person is going to be like until you start fighting. Just imagine, you know, if you go in and you don't know that someone was born male, how that's very big disadvantage. I think there's a propensity for violence that exists in the mind of a man that I just don't know if it's the same in most women. I just think, I don't know how much of that.

Speaker 4:          02:16:01       Like I don't know if you turn me into a woman, how much of that you would squeeze out? I don't know, but I know there's a switch that men have because I've seen it go off. I've seen, I've seen, I've probably seen more people get fucked up in real life than 99 point nine percent of people that have ever lived other than like, you know, people lived in Roman times and we get chopped up by swords, but people in modern time, I can targe fisticuffs people getting head kicked and beaten down with elbows. I've probably seen more of that than almost anyone that's ever lived is sort of probably a small group of people. I got thousand people on the planet that seen as many people get fucked up personally is I have, so I did you. Did you date at chunk you? You get a sense of what you're seeing.

Speaker 4:          02:16:55       You get a sense of and you, you understand there's a, there's a, there's, there's a technical violence that women are capable of. For sure. I mean especially like extreme examples like cris cyborg is like super violent or when Holly Holm head kicked Ronda Rousey and then hammer fists at her while she was unconscious. Super violent, but also very technical violence. And then there's an extreme over the top masculine violence that I've seen that's even more ferocious. There's, there's something to it that is another level this in. And this is not saying that men are better than women. This is not. This is just I'm saying there's a thing that men do. There's a reason why men cause all wars. Men Cause all wars. Women are fucking suit up and going into battle and, and, and trying to conquer as a giant, you know, million strong group of women, soldiers invading a foreign army.

Speaker 4:          02:17:55       No, this is not happening. This is a male behavior. Testosterone. It is. And it, it's also. There's something about males. This, this switch, this violent switch that exists. It exists in a very dark way. Women are capable of shooting people, stabbing people and doing all these things. Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying that, but it does not happen in the same numbers that it happens with men. It just doesn't. And I think that this is something that also has to be taken into consideration when you talk to you about men versus women. Like it's a, it's a different thing and people don't think it's a different thing have probably never been punched in the face by a guy you know, or seeing guys punch guys in the face or been around it enough where you realize like it's a different thing. You know, I've seen some awesome women fights, awesome women fights amazing, super technical, even very violent, but God damn it, there's a different. There's a difference. It's just not the same thing. Yeah, no, I would definitely agree with that and most people would. But if in today's climate, in certain circles that would be considered transphobic or maybe even sexist,

Speaker 6:          02:19:03       well, there's also this narrative that women, because they need to be like men and some level women have to be as strong as men and I've seen this where they will put like published piece of saying women are as strong as men physically strong and that's not even true. It's not true.

Speaker 4:          02:19:18       Only there's a not true. It's you can demonstrate it like scientifically it's not true. You look at the data in terms of what men have, what, what they can do. Like this is this guy, this woman who used to be a man who is now competing in weightlifting and Australia, like everybody's going crazy over this one who is fucking crazy. It doesn't make any sense that they're allowing this. If this is so nonsensical, if you want to have trans transgender Olympics, go for it. Do that, but to try to pretend until we come up with some sort of a way like with crispr or whatever we talked about before, where you can actually turn a man into a woman, turn a woman into a man until it's real clean. We look at it and go, Yup, we just did the chromosome test. You've got a y chromosome now and you've erased 30 years of testosterone and you know a man now is built like you.

Speaker 4:          02:20:12       Right? Then we're good. We're good now. It's an actual woman. Yeah. Until then, man, you're dealing with some hardcore variables and to not to be in denial of those variables is silly and I'm gonna I'm going to stand against it every time because I think it's. I see what it is. I mean, this is like a religious ideology, you're, you're, you're purposely ignoring facts. Do you feel like most people in the industry. I agree with you or how did they feel it? Yeah. Oh fuck. Yeah. Oh yeah. The people who don't is a minor group and they're all like super progressive, left wing, left leaning and some of them were scared to talk about it because other people aren't as vocal. Well, they just didn't want to get the blowback. It's all it is. But in terms of like fighters, it was like a hundred percent mean Ashley.

Speaker 4:          02:21:08       Evan Smith is a fucking beast for taking that fight and even tougher for winning. But then again, she went into the UFC. She, she's in a UFC level fighter, which is, there's a big difference, you know, and what she was kicking me. If you look at like the caliber of competition that she's fought, guys like Raquel Pennington or girls, excuse me, like Raquel Pennington, sorry, Raquel. And look at who found foxes fighting when she was fighting, you know, lower level competitions. That's a giant leap between Raquel Pennington and someone who is on these amateur circuits and Raquel Pennington beat Ashley Evan Smith. Crazy fight was submitted with a bulldog choke with like one second ago. We're screaming. It was nuts. Covered in blood. It's fucking chaos. Right? But this is like super elite world championship level fighting. That's the difference, right? Yeah. It's just fucking different, you know? Yeah. So there was a lot of people that supported me, but I knew I was right. You know, I was like, no, that other people are secretly agreeing with you. I will not even secretly, they just didn't want to talk about it publicly. It wasn't that. It was a secret, you know, there was no people that were coming up to me disagreeing with me. Trans people were agreeing with me, trans people that I'm friends with,

Speaker 2:          02:22:26       like, that shit is crazy. That bitch is out of her fucking mind. It was funny and also in the long run over many, many conversations about it, people realize, okay, I see your perspective. Like you're not discriminatory. No, it's just about combat sports and even about weightlifting, it's like, come on man, imagine if you a woman and all your life, you've been fucking power cleaning through the force of will and determination and your focus and discipline, and then some trans woman comes in and just his bitches lifting 100 pounds more than you're ever going to live and you're like, well, what the fuck? This isn't fair that those poor girls in Texas that had a wrestle that girl because they're discriminatory in the opposite way and they won't recognize that this trans girls, a boy or this trans boy is a boy get injured too. Fuck yeah, yeah, mean literally you're allowing someone. You're allowing girls to take steroids. That's what you're doing. You're saying one girl can take steroids because she thinks she's a boy. We don't think she's a boy, so we'll let her take steroids. It's like, why are you letting her take steroids? This? Why are you late or take testosterone? Do you know how old that girl was or that we've seven chance, boy, okay, one states two years in a row. Wow. Shocker.

Speaker 6:          02:23:45       But you know, by taking those, by taking testosterone too, he is sterilizing himself. Yeah. Which is crazy at that age. Yeah. I want to say specifically of that person, but just in general.

Speaker 2:          02:23:58       Well, as a neuroscientist in your understanding of the frontal lobe and the development of human, because you realize like your decision making capabilities not fully formed,

Speaker 6:          02:24:07       not till you're almost 30. So I just want people should vote. That's when they, that's when they should make any sort of important decision. But it's crazy because you think a 17 year old or even like A. I don't even 21 year old can decide if they want to be sterile for life.

Speaker 2:          02:24:22       No, no. If you gave me a chance at 17 to get a vasectomy, I might've done it. You know, now I'm happy I have kids, but it's um, it's an irreversible decision, which is why it gets weird. Right. It's like if you decide to sterilize yourself at testosterone, is there any. Coming back from that, have you started taking estrogen again? Where your, where your cycle kicked back in?

Speaker 6:          02:24:44       No. Well, once you start taking cross sex hormones. No, no, no, and it's amazing because parents are saying, well, you know, if that's the decision they want to make, then they should make that decision and they're okay with it.

Speaker 2:          02:24:56       What's interesting too is the language that we use and that people use in the media now. If there was a story about a woman who just gave birth. Oh,

Speaker 6:          02:25:05       tell me more actually, because I thought I thought I was thinking of something, but I think it's something else.

Speaker 2:          02:25:09       She used to be a woman. She'd be, she was transitioning to being a man and she got pregnant. Okay. But became a full man. Oh, after she gave birth, had her breast removed the deal. Right. Celebrated, celebrated as this men give birth. But it was, well, not only that, she, I don't think she breastfed was, shouldn't be celebrated. Like, like there's massive amounts of evidence that breastfeeding is super positive because that look at that full beard holding a baby. So clearly taking the testosterone again, if not taking it while the baby's in the womb. And uh, I'm sure five years after having a child as a woman, what transgender man gives birth to baby five years after having a child as a woman. Okay. So she had a child as a woman and then she got pregnant again as a man. That's what they're saying. Okay. What does that mean? What's going on there? Magic. You are an alien.

Speaker 6:          02:26:17       So I guess it isn't impossible to get pregnant. But if you're straight from pubertal blockers, straight onto cross sex hormones, you know, your body hasn't even really developed. So in that case, so as a grown up,

Speaker 2:          02:26:31       it's less likely that you will become sterile. Is that the case?

Speaker 6:          02:26:34       I think it depends on how. I'm not an endocrinologist, but I think it has to do with how long you've been on the hormones and probably how old you were when you started.

Speaker 2:          02:26:44       Right?

Speaker 6:          02:26:45       But in this case, I mean I've, I've seen cases too where trans women will breastfeed but there and the doctors say this is an amazing thing, but they're taking hormone. So basically those hormones are going to the baby when they're

Speaker 2:          02:26:59       breastfeeding the boy.

Speaker 6:          02:27:03       I feel, I mean I even feel bad saying child in danger mode. I know I feel bad saying this right now, but why I feel it feels like I'm placing judgment I guess

Speaker 2:          02:27:12       shouldn't be placing judgment. While we were talking about something that's publicly projected, something that's in the news, they chose to make this. They chose to be there with their cameras were taking pictures of them. They're proclaiming this,

Speaker 6:          02:27:25       that the other side isn't being presented to. I think that's part of the problem is the other side of the things that we're saying.

Speaker 2:          02:27:31       Yes. Well this is what. So what are the other thoughts? What is the other side?

Speaker 6:          02:27:35       Well, the one side of being that is progressive and if you identify as a woman and you have a child, then you should raise that child as if that's no different from any other woman, but she doesn't identify as a woman. She identifies as a man or not this person, the person I was talking about who is breastfeeding

Speaker 2:          02:27:50       male-to-female, you can breastfeed male to female. Oh, oh, wait a minute for that. It's not his kid, her kid. Oh boy, we worth this is why those gender pronouns, Jordan Peterson was wrong. This is why we need all these separate gender pronouns. All 72 of them. Well, here's the other thing, this male transgender male obviously still likes dudes. The one we just saw because she got pregnant by a guy. Yep. So stay at check, Bro. I don't know as just telling you to do whatever you want to do, but you know, we should probably take into consideration the idea that maybe this isn't the best thing for that child to be subjected to hormones.

Speaker 6:          02:28:43       No, that's, that's the bottom line. I think whether a parent is trans or not have a bearing on their ability to parent.

Speaker 2:          02:28:49       So while that trans man was pregnant, did he continue his testosterone therapy? Is the question, right? That's the question. Hold this one says no. That's how will they get pregnant? Oh, so they backed off to have a baby on purpose. They were, they took, they got off the testosterone for health reasons and then got pregnant. That's this particular case. Health reasons. Yeah. But I thought it was natural and awesome. It's good for you. That's the other thing too, right? If it is natural, why do you have to have synthetic hormones injected into your body that are not endogenous like they did not even supposed to be in your body? This is so crazy. We live in such a bizarro world. Seeing a guy with a beard who was fully pregnant with a hairy chest is so fucking odd. I'd assume me as a hairy chest.

Speaker 6:          02:29:37       It's also, I mean, it goes against people who say that gender is a social construct. Why do you need to take testosterone then to meet the opposite sex?

Speaker 2:          02:29:44       Well, this is one of the weirdest things that the argument that I had, um, about one person online where they said about Fallon Fox, they said she's always been a woman. And I said even when she was having sex with a woman and got her pregnant and she said yes. Even then I'm like, we're done. We're done here. We were in make believe land now. But what does that mean? Your role? You were a woman when you were having sex with a woman. So why not just stay that woman who has sex with women?

Speaker 6:          02:30:13       I think it's because people want to have sympathy. Right? And so it's kind of like, that's a nice story to tell. Yes, but it's not, it's not true,

Speaker 2:          02:30:21       but that's the problem is that you're not dealing with reality. You're, you're, you're, you're into this weird fantasy land that opens you up to massive amounts of criticism from people that might be discriminatory instead of saying, yeah, this is problematic and weird and strange, and the whole thing is weird. Instead of saying that saying, no, she's always been a woman. Well the fuck does that mean it's such a blanket statement to write, but it's a wonderful thing to do to shut down all rational critique of this situation. It's a wonderful way to do it. She's always been a woman. Like, really?

Speaker 6:          02:30:54       That's the only way they can win too though. Because if you actually enter into a conversation, you have to actually think about your position right now. Actually think of ways to argue with the other person. And that takes effort. Yes. So it's a lot easier just to simply say they were wrong and you can't argue with someone's lived experience. It doesn't just take effort. It's

Speaker 2:          02:31:10       also an acknowledgement of the oddity of the situation. Like there's you have to take into account, like if you're, if you're not committed to one side or the and you're looking at it for what it really is, you really have to go, wow. It's so strange. Like be open minded, be accepting, be completely embracing of all oddities, strange, different variables of the, the, the broad spectrum of human sexuality. Be Open to all of it, but also be aware of how fucking weird it is because it is weird. It's not. You don't have to have hate in your heart to recognize that. It's strange to see a guy with a beard breastfeeding, right? Yeah. You know, or fully pregnant. It's fucking strange. I mean it just is.

Speaker 3:          02:32:01       Then I think if you're a curious person too, you know, you want to learn more and you want to ask questions, but like in the climate now you can't even do that even if your heart isn't a good place.

Speaker 2:          02:32:09       Yeah. But it's hard for people to know that your heart is in a good place. It's just part of the problem when you know you don't fall in line with the accepted narrative. People think, well, oh, it must be because you're conservative or you're transphobic or homophobic or something wrong where you're not on board with the way people are thinking today. You're stuck in the past and that it's on the wrong side of history. That's a good one. But it's just, you know, it's hard to fully express your feelings on nuanced tissues.

Speaker 3:          02:32:44       Yeah. Well, it takes effort, right? It takes time and you have to actually think about what is your position and you actually have to look at the facts and then have a nuance position. Because I don't think most of these issues, you can't just simply go with one side or the other across the board or simply go with what sounds nice. There's usually a lot of other stuff underlying that that needs to kind of be hashed out.

Speaker 2:          02:33:04       What is your transition into academia from academia to the, you know, doing what you do now. Being able to write things and do podcasts and be free of that sort of create what has that been like,

Speaker 3:          02:33:18       the process or what? What led me to do it

Speaker 2:          02:33:20       both the process. What law you will, you were described what led you to do it?

Speaker 3:          02:33:23       Okay. So I just finished my phd last year and the last two years I realized that academia changed a lot. So when I first two years and I would say in the four years I did my phd, it changed a lot. So when I started there are certain topics that were in little taboo but you could still ask questions and I had planned to stay in academia and continue being a sex researcher. I love sex research, but I realized as time went on that you can ask important questions anymore and especially when it comes to gender, sex differences and gender dysphoria. So at the time, um, with regards to the debate on kids with gender dysphoria there, every single mainstream news piece in left leaning outlets was saying young kids should transition. That's the best thing for them. And so you'd see all this coverage of young kids who had transitioned to the opposite sex and their parents were elated, the kids were doing so well.

Speaker 3:          02:34:17       Uh, but from a scientific perspective, that's not what the research shows. As I said, most kids will grow their feelings, so it's best to just wait and see. And so I wrote an op ed about that and at the time I wrote it and I sat on it for probably about six months trying to decide whether I should really try and get it published because I knew that people were gonna be really upset even though I was just talking about the scientific literature. And I asked my colleagues, what do you think? And they said to me, I said, should I wait until I have tenure to publish this? And they said, even if you have tenure, it's not going to protect you nowadays. So, uh, you know, I was lucky. My mentors have always been very supportive of looking at facts and looking at the truth and don't worry about whether it's politically incorrect or not.

Speaker 3:          02:35:00       Just say you do a study, just present what you found, don't worry about how people are going to take it, but not everyone is like that and especially even in the hard sciences now if you publish the, I mean it won't even get published now if you find things that are controversial because journals don't want to have to deal with that. The institutions don't want have to deal with that, so I made the decision to publish that op Ed and then from there I said, well, I'm going to see what this journalism thing can take me, and so now I say whatever I want.

Speaker 4:          02:35:27       Well that sort of behavior and that thought process is such on their side is such a weakening or the foundation of critical thinking and the. It also comes at the same time as these platforms like podcasting and youtube that allows a person like you or like Jordan Peterson to now disconnect and have a far larger audience. Although it is scary. There was quite a bit of censorship going on with some of those platforms. With Youtube. Yeah. Youtube blogs to they they. They have the cute thing they do. They demonetize things. I'd probably do you monetize this podcast? For sure. They even let you upload it after. Although let us upload. Okay. But the demonetization, especially since we're criticized youtube, as soon as you criticize you, that's like one of the best ways to get demonetized from one of their videos is to criticize them. Yeah, it's fucking squirrely.

Speaker 3:          02:36:23       It's also make people like if you're subscribed, they don't tell people when videos get posted, something like that. Right.

Speaker 4:          02:36:30       They do some weird shit. I don't pay attention, just upload it and keep moving, but I have friends who were there. It's their main source of income was youtube and videos and advertising for them was a disaster. Like people that were making a lot of money and then all sudden that money was cut down to 30 percent of what it used to be and with no, no clear guidelines. The problem with the guidelines is even if like say if we have a video and they just decide that they don't like the video, you can't really protest it. You can protest it and. But then they review it and then they uphold their initial ruling and they don't tell you why. There's no. They don't say, well, hey, you called someone a queer or you did this or no, no.

Speaker 2:          02:37:16       They just say, yeah, this is how it is. And it's subjective. Yeah, well it's a problem with being a monopoly and they're not a monopoly in the fact that there's not other video platforms, but there are certainly the largest by far in terms of like user uploaded video platforms. There's not even a close second, which is kinda weird. It's amazing that they've done it, you know, I mean, there's nothing remotely like it. I know a bunch of people thought about building one and I've been contacted by people that are starting up a new one. They want me to join that and like, good luck, good luck. I mean, youtube is so far ahead. It's like, how do you catch up to them? And I don't think they're evil by any stretch of the imagination. And uh, I had a conversation with someone about it pretty recently where she was describing that they're really, they're, they're using crude tools and this is part of the problem with what, what is being deemed as censorship is really they're trying to root out hate speech and they're doing so with crude tools that will eventually through ai get better and better.

Speaker 3:          02:38:22       Is that it though, or is it that they're trying to shut down any sort of dissenting points of view?

Speaker 2:          02:38:27       I don't know. You know, I think they definitely lean hard left. They definitely do. So does google. They lean hard left. That was proven by the paper and the, you know, how it was received, the memo

Speaker 3:          02:38:41       actually, you know what, because I was doing youtube for a bit and then I stopped just because I unfortunately didn't have time because my writing is like my number one thing. But I had one video that minute it went up. I was talking about science on gender dysphoria. Got Demonetized literally like 20 minutes. And I thought, Oh, you know, I know what my intentions are. And it's really unsettling when that happens.

Speaker 2:          02:39:01       It will, it should be because you're not doing anything hateful know, and what they're doing is they're trying to make subjects much less attractive to discuss [inaudible] and who's doing it. I mean is it doing it through crude tools or someone looking at it and flagging it and deciding that this is not something they want to be involved with advertising and in their defense, a lot of this got started off by people that were really doing fucked up things on youtube and they had to respond and they had to figure out a way to eliminate that stuff in their platform and I think once you start censoring, the tendency is to continue to expand. This tendency is not to back off of that center ship. Like you know, we're just gonna allow Holocaust deniers and racists and make your videos. His Youtube is a wild west baby aren't going to do that because they have advertisers and there's a significant amount of revenue that they get from that,

Speaker 3:          02:39:59       but they don't actually end the conversation though. People just get upset and they take the car. They might not be on youtube, but that people are still talking about these things, but they're not youtube

Speaker 2:          02:40:06       as long as they're not on youtube, they don't give a shit like, yeah, you're not on youtube. Good luck with that conversation on Vimeo or wherever you're going to go. It's, um, it's, it's odd. But it's also, I've, I love it. I love that there's these disco. I love the law part of me even likes the fact that things are being censored. I really do. I find it fascinating. I feel like the argument is fascinating because I think first of all, I think censorship clearly causes that. I think when you push against something, there's a natural reaction. That reaction is to bolster your defenses and fire back up. And, uh, I think there's certainly some of that going on. You can't really quiet ideas entirely, but you do, you do expose your intentions and you expose these blind spots that are what we've been discussing all day. There's this political ideology, a blind spots that people have these ideological holes that they have and the way they look at things.

Speaker 3:          02:41:17       Question is, do you want to solve the problem or are you trying to just be successful as a business if you want to solve the problem? I don't think suppressing speech and shutting down people who are genuinely just trying to ask questions and have conversations. I don't think that's going to solve things.

Speaker 2:          02:41:34       I don't think they're trying to solve any problems. I think they're trying to make a ton of money and they're also very liberal and they think the right thing to do is to suppress certain ideology. They deemed harmful or hate speech. You know, I had a conversation with a woman as a youtube exec. She was telling me that Douglas Murray and Sam Harris, they there this podcast that they did online and uh, some guy put it up in his playlist and he got a community guideline strike for having it in this playlist. And I said, how is that? And she said, it's hate speech. I said, it's his speech speech. I heard that podcast. And not only is it not hate speech, you didn't watch it. She didn't listen to it like she had no idea what the fuck it was, but she just like confidently said it to me like I was going to just shut up.

Speaker 2:          02:42:20       Like you're out of your fucking mind. You don't even know what you're talking about. This is hilarious, but it was a person out of pretty high level over there. So it's interesting to see that like, okay, well this is the kind of a lack of critical thinking that we're discussing. This is the kind of blind spot that we're discussing that you feel like you could just say that instead of appreciate that this is to intellectuals discussing something that's very complex and that is, it was about immigration and about Islam and those are two things that people don't want to hear. You know, they just like go. Those two things are off limits. Unless you're a pro Islam or pro immigration, you better shut the fuck up or we're going to demonetize you and that, that kind of censorship is fascinating to me because it's not effective. It's, it just, it just makes people go, hey, and you know, and then it, it makes the people on the youtube side get defensive and it makes them double down and you know, and you're seeing, you see that now. I mean, you see it with many people. It's, it's a weird time for ideas. Yeah. How do you feel about being part of the Idw, the international dark web?

Speaker 2:          02:43:38       Um, I'm the least mentioned, happily the least mentioned person in that group. I'm very happy about that. I don't like being in any groups. Would a, Groucho Marx once a, uh, I don't want to be a part of any club that would have me look. I'm very happy to be able to have a platform where I can have people like you on or any of those people, whether it's Bret Weinstein or Eric Weinstein Stein, sorry guys. Bret Weinstein era after harvey. Everybody got real. He's really sweet. He's great. And his wife Heather is amazing as well. He'll be on actually the next season of wrong speak. Oh cool. Heather hiding his wife is amazing too. And they were on together and Sam Harris is a good friend and I love that guy. He's a fascinating person. And as, as Jordan and a look, I don't agree with a lot of what Ben Shapiro says. He's a super nice guy and I really like them, you know?

Speaker 2:          02:44:36       And that's, that's. You saw that thing that happened with that actor. Mark was the same mark duplass. Is that a same, got in trouble for tweeting that? A very nice and reasonable person. Yeah. Yeah. It's a fun time. Ben Is really nice too. He's a really nice guy, you know, I liked them a lot. This internet, whatever it is, the dark web thing, that's all eric. Eric Weinstein's idea was to name this and label. He loves all that Shit. He loves all that cloak and dagger stuff. He gets kicked out of it, but he makes some very good points and he's a brilliant, brilliant guy. And um, this idea that we're all joined together. I mean we all went, uh, we had a big dinner together, like a bunch of dorks and we all got together and were like this little club. And that's kind of fun and we're going to do it again and we're bringing more people into bringing more people into the dark web.

Speaker 2:          02:45:34       Some people are resentful that they're not a part of the dark web and I'll tell you some names afterwards, but some people like contacted Barry Weiss and were upset that they weren't included in the dark web. I loved berries column. It was interesting. It's the whole but the label of it all. I mean it's. What's interesting is it, it starts this conversation, right? So why is it even necessary to have this dark web and what's the function of this dark web? What is this? What is the dark web doing really like what is, you know, and there was an article today where someone was calling it problematic and saying that it's mostly right people, which is

Speaker 4:          02:46:10       absolutely not true. Sam Harris very left Bret Weinstein, fiercely progressive. Eric very left. I'm way more left than I am, right to the very few right wing ideas that I hold onto the very small. It was very. The vast majority of my positions on things side with, with people on the left, vast majority, I'm Ben Shapiro, was very right, but he's reasonable, you know, and he's also a young guy, you know, conservative religious. It's, but he's also extremely intelligent and reasonable. Talked to him and he has himself disavowed some of the things that he said and he's, he's himself criticized his own words. He wrote a whole column. Here's a list of all the stupid things I've ever said online because he's, he's, you know, he's a very aware guy, very self aware. I think, um, I think it's important to have discussions and I think it's important that when people feel like those discussions are being suppressed, that they talk about that. And I think that's what this whole thing is. And I think you're a part of that as well.

Speaker 2:          02:47:27       I was in the column. Yeah, we could use you in the dark web, a woman of color that you guys aren't all racist much white people. God Damn it. I took a 23 and me and I'm hoping I've got some black and Korean. I'm hoping for you to give me some. Give me more than five percent. What is it that you have to have? I think you only have to have like one slash 16th native American to catch a check and some places. I'm not sure what it is in Canada, but something like that. Yeah. Yeah. Like if you go fishing in, in Canada and you're a first nation, if you have an a what the number is, but you could bring as many fish as you want, but like if you like I was fishing in Canada in a place where I could only get one Walleye a day. You only get one, but there was some dude next to me was first nations. Homeboy was just pulling them in. Dr Wright and sticking them in a bucket. Clean it up. So you better be hoping on that test then. I'm hoping. I'm hoping I'm praying. I just want to be discriminated against.

Speaker 2:          02:48:31       One 16th is one great great grandparents. Oh, that's all you need. That's all I need. Somebody come on chimp in your family too. For sure. Somebody fucked a champ. This is what I think. I think if people evolved from lower hominids, right, that's what happened. That if you believe all that evolution nonsense, nonsense, no one believes that anymore. It's pseudoscience. Yeah. It's a bunch of pseudo science, but I think that somewhere in my ancestry, somebody went back in for one more shot chimp when they probably shouldn't have somebody said I was going to know. They probably got drunk. No judgment, no judgment. And clearly evolution is not. It's not a fucking straight flat plane. Right. It varies. Yeah.

Speaker 6:          02:49:17       You can't deny the influence of it,

Speaker 2:          02:49:20       you know, that's some people do. Yeah. Well, I dunno. What do you think about all this dark web stuff?

Speaker 6:          02:49:29       Um, I, I felt, I mean, the fact that the New York Times covered it give me a sense of relief because sometimes the things I write, I don't feel like the things I write are that controversial or that offensive. But the response I get sometimes, I'm surprised

Speaker 2:          02:49:46       you said this as, as a journalist, as a journalist, as intellectual, as a person who actually understands what you're talking.

Speaker 6:          02:49:53       Yeah. Especially someone who has studied, especially these certain topics within research, I think I know what I'm talking about, and so when people get really mad it makes you question where are we going? So the fact that, you know, Barry covered this and I'm that the response was so positive. I mean, people got mad too. Oh, people got mad at her. She's taken a lot of heat. Yeah. Yeah, definitely a lot. Yeah. But I feel a little bit more optimistic because it, it tells me that people get it, that we have conversations like this and people don't think that we're bigoted or that were coming from. We have a nefarious agenda, right? We just want to have conversations and talk about things that aren't being discussed in the mainstream.

Speaker 2:          02:50:36       Yeah. That's where censorship becomes very dangerous if you do silence a lot of these conversations and right now they're not being silenced even though they're, they're being democratized to a certain extent. That is a problem, but the conversation still exists and as long as they do still existent, the vast majority exist in audio form anyway. And podcasting is the vast majority of the volume of people that are downloading these kinds of conversations. I think it's an incredibly unique time for the distribution of ideas. I don't think there's ever any ever been anything remotely like this in human history. There's never been a time where someone like me can just do something, uh, just on a laptop with a Webcam and then nine years later it's this, you know, we're just fucking nuts and I don't even. I'm aware of it, but I don't even think about it that much honestly. I just do it. I'm, I was excited to talk to you today. I was looking forward to it. I was excited to too. But I don't, I don't give it much consideration as far as the impact because I think as soon as you do that, it'll slip through your fingers. Like if you think too much about it. Yeah. Well, I definitely wouldn't say half the Shit I've already said today. Right. That's, that's appeal

Speaker 4:          02:52:06       though. The appeal is that you and I, I really believe this. If there was no microphone, we probably would never have this conversation because it's too difficult to sit. It would be too weird like you and I was just going to sit down and just talk to each other. Was came in and met you and we sat down. Would be weird, like you almost have to have this where people could see it to do it because otherwise you'd check your phone. I check my phone, get up, go to the bathroom. It's like it would be a normal thing to do, but by putting these headphones on and by having this microphone in front of our face, we lock in and know that how many million people are going to be watching fuck load. It's more every week. It's growing in a weird way like a fucking mold.

Speaker 4:          02:52:49       It's amazing. Strange, but this is the only way we would have this conversation and it's made me far better at talking to people and understanding conversations and understanding what they are and also examining my own speech patterns and the way I communicate and getting better at it. I like how you said you started it just because you wanted to talk to people. Like I think that's what it should be. It should just be that interest in having a conversation. Well, I used to like doing radio when I was a guest, you know, uncertain radio shows, you know, like you do. Like if I was going to go to phoenix or something like that, I would go do stand up there. I would have to promote it on the radio and the old days and I would get there and I would get there early and you know, smoke a joint beforehand, drink a cup of coffee and get in and start talking shit and having a good time and laughing and be like, oh, that'd be fun to have a radio show man, you know, just go in there and just talk and have fun.

Speaker 4:          02:53:45       But the problem was to me it was like always the censorship. I was like, Oh, you got to censor yourself. Then I started doing the open anthony show and opie and anthony had a show on, you know as first if it was Xm, then it became serious and and then they split up, but when I would do that it was opie and Anthony and Jim Norton and I was like, this is the best, this is so fun and the way they did it, credit to them, the way they did it was different than any radio show at ever been a part of because it was no structure at all. They would just bring comics in. It would just be me and Ari should fear and bill burr and Joey Diaz and all these guys. They would just come in and hang out and talk shit. There was no structure at all.

Speaker 4:          02:54:29       It was just. Anthony is such a smart and funny guide. Opie would sort of run the thing and and Jim was there and they would just let everybody talk and I'd be like, this would be amazing. You could just come in and hang out and have fun and then I'm done. I started doing a podcast after that, but it was because of that and then anthony did a thing called live from the compound. He calls his house the compound and he did like this thing in his basement. We had a green screen and he did his own show and he did Karaoke while he's holding a machine gun. He's fucking crazy. Anthony is like a legit gun nut, but he had a studio that he built in his basement with like legitimate equipment and I went, oh, and that inspired me and that, that is literally what started me off to do a podcast. The scene that he had set this up in his basement and I was like, don't just fucking just start doing it. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          02:55:22       Wow. Yeah.

Speaker 6:          02:55:24       I was going to say the same thing. I feel the wrong speed. The fact that I can see people being mommed and I can think, okay, I wonder what they're like and I can just ask them like, is that what it's like for you? You see someone you think, I just want to talk to them?

Speaker 4:          02:55:38       Oh yeah, yeah. Especially someone in a controversial position like Jordan, like when I first met Jordan, it's like when he was just starting to get some attention online and I wanted to talk to them, I was like, well, what is going on here and why? Why is everybody be up so upset at you? And I've never met anyone in in all my life who is so purposely misrepresented by other people than Jordan. Yeah, I've never seen it before. It's, it's amazing to see intelligent, articulate people clearly lying about his positions, about how and not and not even understanding that by doing that they're strengthening him and they're strengthening their. You're not going to lie to the point where people are going to really

Speaker 4:          02:56:31       think that your position is correct and all these things that Jordan has said that somehow or another you misheard them or the whole world ms dot heard them. Oh, you're misrepresenting his positions and that just makes all the people that are siding with him realize he's right. Yeah. It strengthened Sam. They literally don't understand that they are his publicists. They are helping. They are proving his point and to the point where he's selling out. He sold out gigantic 5,000 seat theaters. Yeah. He's selling them out all over the world just talking. It's crazy. He's making millions of dollars because of them being stupid. It's fucking amazing. It's really amazing and all of it came out of him putting his foot down in opposition to the very same things that you experienced that forced you to leave academia is misrepresenting of reality. That seems to be going in and I think it's fueling the. It's certainly fueling the dark web, but on top of that,

Speaker 6:          02:57:43       these people are seeing that they can't trust what they're being told. Yeah,

Speaker 1:          02:57:48       they are.

Speaker 4:          02:57:50       They can't trust what they're being told and they. They understand that there's other conversation to be had out there. There was an article that I tweeted today that was really interesting. I was like, wow, this is crazy. It was talking about long form podcasts and the ability that longform podcast have to allow people to have rational civil discourse instead of just like getting on these fucking CNN shows and yelling at each other for three minutes, which is sometimes you get a panel. Everyone just agrees with each other. Yes. Yeah. Or the panels are crazy too. How the fuck you going to have nine people talking at the same time that it's crazy. It's hard to do. When I do podcasts with two other people, it's hard. Well, it's entertainment, but it's not a good way to discuss topics, you know, long form conversations are really the only way where you can get a good sense of where someone stands on a position and how they think, you know, like I get a chance to see like you like and a lot of people are going to get a chance to see you today.

Speaker 4:          02:58:58       How you think about things, what, what your thought process is, and if there's holes in that thought process, they get exposed. And that's I think also with issues that are more complex. You can talk about all the different nuances to that issue because if you just simply have your talking points and you sort of. If you do like a standard interview that's say seven minutes long, it's going to be very, very sparse in terms of what you're saying. Yeah. I mean there's not a single thing we discussed today that wasn't 15 minutes long at least. Right? Yeah, and you can't really condense that and mean you could condense it down, but you lose a lot of the information and also you feel like you didn't do it justice. Like I can't do those panel shows because I feel like there's no way I'm going to be able to do anything justice.

Speaker 4:          02:59:45       I just as not snow room. Especially now when people play it up to they know that they're there for the entertainment value, so it's more about being upset at what someone's saying. Some real under having some real understanding. Right. It's also about barking out your talking points in this like ferocious a manner as you can so that it can appear that you're winning. Yeah. You're a nice guy too though. You know you're not going to come and attack somebody. I definitely don't want to do that. The the what? I have people on our. Even someone that I think I'm going to disagree with, I just want. I wanted to see how they think I want. Even some people get mad. They go, oh dude, you know, you more for your opinions based on whoever's on the show. That's not what I do, but what I do do is I let people talk and I try to see their point of view and I try to expand their point of view. So if they say something, they're also. So what it is is that this, and I want them to keep going. I want, I want to. I want to see the whole landscape or their thought process. I don't want to want to see a tiny garden. I don't want to see a little potted plant. I want to see the whole thing. I want to get a sense of why do I disagree with them? What am I fucked up? Maybe it's me. Maybe it's maybe it's them should be too. I

Speaker 6:          03:01:00       don't think people should be stuck in their opinion of even no matter how right you think you are, I think you should always be open to changing your mind.

Speaker 2:          03:01:07       I think so too, but I think that's one of the rarest qualities when it comes to discourse is the ability that people have to abandon ideas that they've supported in the past because

Speaker 6:          03:01:18       what does that mean then? If you're on one side and everyone in your life thinks this way, what does it mean if you don't think that way?

Speaker 2:          03:01:24       Yeah. Well, what is. What are the. Are Are the ideas you or you, you and the ideas are just things that you're. You're examining. Yeah, that's what it should be, but for most people, including me, most of my life, that was not the case. If I had an idea and I, if I supported that idea that I'll fucking fight you. This is this arm, right, and you're wrong, and what change? Then doing this, doing this podcast changed the way I talk to people. Change the way I look at life. I've talked to so many smart people. I mean, I've had a thousand 100, 1200, 1200 podcasts plus all the mma ones. Um, there's so many conversations. So in, through those conversations I've gotten at least not a formal education, but an understanding of things that I never had before

Speaker 6:          03:02:19       across a lot of subject.

Speaker 2:          03:02:20       Yeah. Yeah. And through that I think of understand, I've come to understand not just how I think about things, but why, why, uh, I've had road blocks and conversations before and speed bumps and, and I've learned, you know, I think if you examine your own yourself and your own thoughts, you're sure to learn hopefully.

Speaker 6:          03:02:46       Yeah. And I think it also can help if you look at the other side, it can help you figure out why you believe what you believe too, because you can look at them and say, okay, I still don't agree with you and this is why I think if people aren't even willing to look at the other side and consider why they might be wrong, how do you really know?

Speaker 2:          03:03:04       Yeah. And then you also run into some people that they don't really have opinions. They have these things that they've adopted, like slogans. Yeah, they, they've, they've gotten these things, they've decided this is what my side support, so I'm going to just spout this out and this makes me seem like I'm a good team player. And, and then the thing about podcast though, when you sit down for three hours, you go, why do you think that? Like what's going on there? And then they start talking about why they think that and then know it all falls apart and then you realize that they don't even know why they think that. Yeah. And they probably never even thought about it before they just been saying what they've been saying for so long. Right. Because it sounds nice. Yeah. Yeah. People love to do that. They love it.

Speaker 2:          03:03:49       It's a sport. I mean there's idea sports, you know, an idea. Sports or arguments, arguments are so oftentimes idea sports. Yeah. Politics too. To some degree I think. Oh yeah, for sure. But the politics are just so flavored by money. The problem with that, you know, that version of idea sport is lobbyists and special interest groups and different people that are pushing you to get in the office cause you're going to change laws and force things through and that's the trickiest of all idea sports and also the most shallow. I mean just think about presidential debates and speeches and those are the most shallow discussions in terms of the actual reality of. Yeah, and who that person is. Who is that person? Imagine if you were dating someone and every time you went on a date with them it was like a presidential speech. People like, what the fuck are you?

Speaker 2:          03:04:42       I don't even know you are. You don't display any humanity. Kind of interesting though. Yeah, for sure. Write a book about that. But that's what we want in leaders, right? We want someone who's full of Shit, who, who like makes us feel better. Like they. Yeah. That they're speaking like a leader. You know? It's weird. It's weird that we liked these patterns. So you know, the, the, the presidential speaking pattern is of a very, very strange one. Yeah. It's soothing though. Yeah, I guess in a way, right? Yeah. In a way it's soothing because we want a big daddy, big daddy to take care of us, you know, tell us everything will be okay. But as you get older that makes less and less sense. Like I'm 50 and so if a new president was 45, I'd be like, that bitch don't know shit. He know have only been living in 45 years.

Speaker 2:          03:05:38       Shit, you know, but like when you're 30 and the president's 70 like, well you make sense he's an established person, he's a man of reason. But is it at the age difference or is it your own maturity? Well, there's a lot of old dummies for sure. There's a lot of dummies who just survived because we nerfed up the world for them. Yeah, it's your own maturity. It's also the amount of time that you have to examine ideas. See, if I worked in a coal mine, I probably would not have the time to sit around all day and think shit through. There's a a great luxury that you have when you're, when you do this for a living, that you get a chance to communicate with people over and over and over again, and there'll be another podcast. Tomorrow's another podcast next day. Every day I'm looking at a new person and talking to a new brain and trying to see how it goes on in there.

Speaker 2:          03:06:30       What's behind the eyes figured out? Is that why you like it this length? You know what? Everybody told me not to do this. This is where the Arusha fear. It's famously told me to go to your podcast. I go, why? No one's going to listen to it for that long so they don't listen and don't give a fuck. Like I'm just going to do this. He's like, you should. Or like, why? Well, this parts that are not good. I go, yeah, those parts you're going to have to either skip over or just not. Not downloaded. I don't give a shit.

Speaker 6:          03:07:02       The nice thing about long form though too, if people know it's not edited, they trusted a bit more.

Speaker 2:          03:07:07       Yes, yes. Yeah, there's definitely that. Yeah. The, the, the, the like that, but the, the, the, the, the, the, yeah, all that. That's in there. Character. That's who you are. That's who you are and you know, there's no way you could free ball an entire three hours and will Sam Harris can do it. He's pretty good at it. Yeah. Super articulate guy with practice while you've been doing this a long time. You're good. Well thank you. You're good at it too. Thank you. Um, which did three hours. Is there anything you would like to, uh, to say or Zany thing you didn't? Don't think we covered.

Speaker 6:          03:07:44       Mm, I guess the only thing I'd say we just launched our first season of wrong speak. The second season will be starting in the fall. Now. How are you doing when you're saying seasons? So we did three for the first and we're going to do another cluster of three or four for the next.

Speaker 2:          03:07:56       But why are you calling them a season? Because it's one group and one particular subjects.

Speaker 6:          03:08:02       No. So then, so next season we're going to do one on political correctness. In comedy. There's going to be one on academic mobbing and then there's gonna be another one that's going to be surprised.

Speaker 2:          03:08:12       Oh, so you plan them out way in advance? Yeah.

Speaker 6:          03:08:15       Well we do a bit more of a. it's kind of more of a structure, like a story. It's not a long form

Speaker 2:          03:08:20       thing. It's more of a more production in there. I've mostly heard you do other people's stuff. Yeah, probably. So you're doing a lot of. How did you. How did you do a lot? Well, I'm not sure how I found out about you, man. I'm sure I found out about you online, but I don't know what it was that, that led me to one of your interviews.

Speaker 6:          03:08:41       Probably the Google memo. I think when I wrote that column defending Jameson Moore's memo because I think that's when we first started being in contact. Yeah. Yeah. But yeah, I do a lot of stuff. I'd so I have a week of convert playboy.com monthly column for the Globe and Mail, which is Canada's national newspaper cohost on wrong speak, the podcast and I'll be doing hopefully lots and lots of more stuff going forward and hopefully we'll do this again. I hope so. This has been so much fun. I'm totally fangirl now until you have been watching you as an mma color commentator forever. So this has been so cool.

Speaker 2:          03:09:15       Well, I thought it was really cool too. I really enjoyed talking to tell people how they can find your social media and all that jazz.

Speaker 6:          03:09:22       Uh, I met Dr Deborah, so on twitter and facebook, Dr Deborah W, so on instagram and then you can check out wrong, speak at wrong speak and all major podcasting platforms, itunes play. We did a deborah. Thank you. Thank you so much. Bye everybody.

Speaker 7:          03:09:46       Mm.
