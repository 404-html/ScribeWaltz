Speaker 1:          00:00          Hello Freak bitches, that fucking story that you're telling on stage now, the story that you told about the prostitute situation when you encouraged me to do it. So funny crying. I'll, I'll tell. I'll tell a, your our listeners now, they're our listeners because everybody, the Joe and Ron show. Thank you. I'll be here every Thursday at 1:30. But it was true. It's a lot of lost my virginity when I was 18 years old to a girl, a prostitute and a in Tijuana, Mexico who was overweight and her teeth had no general direction or color, but she was well within my budget but I got stationed at Pearl and if I found that after a while when she'd been on a one part of Awahoo wasn't hotel st these really cute girls jumping your car and blow you for $5. And it was like the best deal I've ever even heard of. I mean, I was like, they're twice a day, you know. And uh, I was there for eight months and then six months ago I was watching this documentary on transvestites and they started talking about the transvestite scene on hotel street on a wall who had been there for 55 years. I'm like, no, I let a hundred 50 dudes suck my dick.

Speaker 1:          01:19          What's the record? What's the record before you find out? Right when I went to record is that, I don't know, but God, I have to be close. You know, I've dodged that bullet, but I've come close a gang of time. I think I've dodged a bullet. Yeah. If, if I had to dodge the bullet, Kudos. Whenever thing pretended to be her, apparently it tongue is a tongue and the tooth is the tooth because you can't tell man, man from woman mouth. Now, if it would have been a hand job, I'd been going, hey, you're a plumber dude. That hand on my cock thick gorilla head. Jesus, what do you think I am? Yeah. And I would imagine that somebody who has a Dick probably knows how to work it. I guess I'll tell you what, these girls had made quick work at me twice a day.

Speaker 1:          02:02          Forty five seconds. I was in my little dots and headed back to the ship. Do you say girls with air quotes? With air quotes girls? Yeah. Well I still don't like to think of them as dude, you know, in my mind that I don't let myself go there. They're still hot little girls, not little girls. These were fully developed men with Ted's Dad tits. They did. And I was always wondering what, let me play with her pose, you know, they let you get some teddy, but you started going down there where the junk is and they were like swat and your hand away and I'm like, now that should have been, you know, my flag. I don't know. Yeah, well now you know. Yeah. Right. So what were you were in the navy? Is that what you're doing? How long? I wasn't in real long.

I didn't, you know, it just did a lot of drugs and you know, I just, it was horrible out and then they discharged me with an honorable discharge under medical conditions from the Naval Drug Rehabilitation Center in Miramar, California. Oh Wow. So what did, what did you have to get rehabilitated for? Well, I'd actually never seen drugs till I got to the Naval Drug Rehabilitation Center in Miramar, California. I mean everybody had drugs, you know, I was positive for heroin on a WESTPAC, but, so we're eight other people on the ship and, and uh, and uh, then when we ate a ton of acid and you know, it was 75 and that was 18 years old and that was off the hook. Wild. And uh, and you know, they just started actually in my, in my hearing to get me out the, the, the commander of our base called me a hole in our national land of defense. I'm like, God, that's horrible. But what's worse than that? I wonder
