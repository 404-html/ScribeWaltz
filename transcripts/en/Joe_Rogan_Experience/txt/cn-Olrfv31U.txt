Speaker 1:          00:00:01       I think what you said is dead on that you got to go straight. He's got to go straight African-american because white people are just not heavy and we're live. This is what I think we need to recognize the return of Dr Cosby and uh, send a shout out to him and all the folks.

Speaker 2:          00:00:15       So the barbershops, I'm triggered. I'm triggered.

Speaker 1:          00:00:20       You were saying before the show, like what do you do if you're at a comedy club and bill cosby walks? Cause apparently bill cosby's doing standup again. They're like what do you do?

Speaker 2:          00:00:31       Why isn't he in jail? I'm not even sure. I'm like, I'm not sure to be funny. Why guy in jail?

Speaker 1:          00:00:36       Cause the first first trial was, was it a mistrial? Yeah. Yeah, there was a mistrial. Um, they couldn't agree, which is hilarious. Like I mean how many people have to say that guy fucking drug me and rape me. How many people? Like is there some sort of, could you imagine there's like 80 people that are telling the same story of you drugging them and raping them and people like that.

Speaker 2:          00:01:01       So on the Logan, here's what I'll say. Like the soccer up two years. No, I'm sorry. Sorry. I just, I don't want anything black a little bit right now. We're talking about bill cosby. This is too soon for this. I guess I just, you know, and it's interesting that this happened after this weekend was the women's March and I know like a lot of people want to roll their eyes and I was getting a lot of shit on instagram for like the women's March. You guys have it. This is exactly the kind of thing that I'm terrified of is that this guy is now not in jail and he's just like back to doing standup. Yeah. Because I don't know if we've got desensitized or if we just forgot about him or we just got sick of talking about it. Like how, I just don't understand how people in that plumbing,

Speaker 1:          00:01:38       I think he's the, first of all, he has an enormous ego and he's a psychopath and I think that he is, he's just, he has enough fans in, enough people in his community still love him or he can go places and small places and they accept him. And then he's, he's uh, he's advertising it.

Speaker 2:          00:01:57       And what is twitter people that except him with this? Is it people who have their own skeletons in the closet and they see him coming back? It's like they get redemption in some way or maybe it makes them not be incorrigible people or is it like a herd mentality or is it just star fucking like how do you rationalize that in your head? A little bit of Star fucking okay. A little bit of dumb. The fact that he's famous eclipse is the fact that he is,

Speaker 1:          00:02:18       yeah, psychopathic. But then there's also, do you remember how it was right after Oj got innocent? There was a guy, and I want to say his name because I respect him. He's a comic and he went on stage. He said, no, he's a black guy. He goes, my blackness will not allow me to think that Oj did it. And I, uh, I was interesting. It was like, what now? What the fuck did I just hear like that? It's insane. Like, okay, all black people are innocent. What does a black person comes in and kills your family? Will your blackness exonerate that person? Like how, how are you going to handle it then?

Speaker 2:          00:02:54       And I don't know what the demo, I mean, what were, do you know who was in that job? Was it all black people? I know. Anything.

Speaker 3:          00:03:00       I can't read it. Like I'm just, I'm sick to my stomach. You're going to be, no. If it's a, I don't know if it's a blown bit when rape culture on stage performing and there's not like a complete melee of disapproval. That's really scary to me. It is scary. It's scary. But I think that, uh, there's a certain amount of people that get overwhelmed by celebrity, so he shows up. Like, I can't believe he's here. They don't want to say Manson goes up at a jazz club. It's like he's a celebrity, but he's also a Charles Manson. Less of a monster. Here's why. I'll throw this at you. He never killed anybody. Charles Manson actually told people to kill people and they did. And it's terrible that they did it. Like Tex Watson did all the crimes and um, uh, what was her name? Squeaky fromme. She was wanting to try to kill Gerald Ford.

Speaker 3:          00:03:47       They, they're the one who did the crimes. He was just this crazy fuck who talked these people into these things. It's kind of the puppet master. Yeah. But that really scares me. Raped, who knows how many women and allegedly it's also, yeah, it's also, um, it just, it scares me and shakes me to my core, you know, not that a psychopath does psychopathic things, but the people who permit it and who are permissive and are okay with it and don't resist, like the fact that a bunch of people in that club were just like, okay, we're good. Okay. We're all, we don't really know what happened. We just know that he was there and we know that he's going to do another show. And then he announced that he was going to do some show at a jazz club. It's like today, I think, is it today or tomorrow?

Speaker 3:          00:04:28       And is this jazz club? I mean, I don't know who owns it. I don't know enough about it. Probably tonight. And I'm like frozen with disgust. It's like, that's the other thing is that yesterday, so it's already over. It's as promised, he performed at a jazz club today, but this article is yesterday. Wow. That's promise. Like, oh, he's a man of his word. He might be a rapist. He does not lie. And he was wearing that hello friends sweater that he always wears a fucking night and he's got that um, Bobby Brown thing on, I don't know what that is. The microphone or the microphone headpiece thing. And I mean, I don't know. It's just so tricky because it's like, I was getting all these nasty comments on instagram this weekend. Like, why are you getting nasty comments for what I think with what's going on, why, why the guy was posting photos from the women's March, which was the march was about a lot of things.

Speaker 3:          00:05:17       And I think just in the last month or so, there's been a little bit of eye roll of like, oh, this is still going on. You know, like there's a lot of, I think guys and women also who are a little bit exhausted or I had one guy I talked to a couple of weeks ago, a friend of mine who was like, I'm done with this. What do you mean you're done with that? It's like, um, we're done with, uh, sexual predators being, um, getting in trouble and getting fired her and, and getting cleansed from our society and hustled please, you know, stopping from assaulting people in the future. And they were just to go, just do feel like this has gotten ridiculous. You know, there's, I think a lot of people think it's like a hysteria or it's like women

Speaker 2:          00:05:57       being dramatic, um, or something like that. And then something like this happens and I'm like, oh, are we not being dramatic enough because this is crazy that he's just going on stage and performing. Like as if everything's just kind of fine again.

Speaker 1:          00:06:10       Well, I think he's a bad example because I think he's nuts and I don't think it makes any sense.

Speaker 2:          00:06:14       I think anyone who rapes is treating people is not, I think all of these people are not, I think we're more nuts for just being like, okay, I guess he's doing comedy, but I don't think we are. I think most people were like, what in the far outraged, I sent it to Tom Segura and that was his, his immediate reaction was like what? He give me like a bunch of people who are in that jazz club and the guy that owns that jazz club. Fuck you guys. Um, yeah, we don't know. I mean we don't know who these people are. If I'm in a comedy club in bill cosby gets on stage and I'm like, I got to hear what the fuck this bitch has to say. Like that's what I'm thinking. I'm not being like awesome bill cosby's here. So maybe I should give them the benefit of the doubt and assume that they think they're seeing some kind of circus show.

Speaker 1:          00:06:53       I don't think I would say anything. I don't think, I mean I don't think it helps. Like I don't think it was yellow. I don't think I would do that. But I definitely think I would sit there and watch and like study him like some weird fucking creature, which is what he is. He's, he's an aberration in, in humanity. Like, uh, first of all, he's an aberration a couple of ways. Right, right. He's an outlier in terms of the, the, the, the popularity he reached, he reached us insane level of popular and he did in the 60s and the 70s when the world was a different place. Right. And I really, we've talked about this a bunch of times as podcast. I think a lot of people drug people back then, I think it was normal. I think that dropping a mickey and someone's drinks,

Speaker 2:          00:07:35       it was common. Maybe not normal. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:07:37       That's a better way to put it. I think a lot of people did it and I think a lot of people, they will still do it. Yeah. Well, but I think a lot of famous people did it back then. I think they were giving out pills. And I don't think, I think culturally we've evolved way more than we are aware of. I think we think of ourselves as being very similar to people from the 1960s I don't think we are. I think we're way, I think if you go from like 1810 to 1870 I bet people are pretty goddamn similar.

Speaker 2:          00:08:10       Interesting. Yes. Okay. Good point. Yeah. I think technology's moving so fast and adapting to that and the fact that we have alarm systems

Speaker 1:          00:08:16       got a 1960 to 2018 way different. Yeah. Fucking way different. What's acceptable? How people think of things, what we've w just as how people, I think one of the things that's happening and one of the reasons why guys are eyebrow and about the women's march is, is that it's a new thing and this is an overwhelming amount of energy that's headed towards this thing. And but what it represents is years, decades of frustration, women that had to work with guys that were grabbing their ass. I ain't trying to fuck them.

Speaker 2:          00:08:49       Pendulum swung hard. It's like it snapped fast and, and there's also, we always talk about that. And I'm obsessed with epigenetic imprinting. It's not just us, it's our moms and our grandmothers. This happened to, and we carry that pain and that, yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:09:01       suffering with us. There's a lot of guys that say, Hey, I didn't do anything. I shouldn't have to feel this, but this is the thing, these guys saying like, I'm done with this. You're not even a part of this. Like, how are you done with, why is,

Speaker 2:          00:09:13       how is this inconveniencing you? So like, I don't understand how the stuck in traffic. Well, I guess that's it. I mean, that's exactly right. So it's like a couple of, I mean, you're in La, you're always sitting in women's march draft it. And I feel that we have who actually better, yeah, the marathon and the gay pride parade and the whatever. So it's like, I'm so sorry you're going to have to like sit in traffic for an extra 20 minutes, but like, you know, get your Amazon drone. Why are you driving on a Saturday anyway?

Speaker 1:          00:09:38       I get it. I mean, it makes sense. If I just, I guess I don't an office, I fucking hate it.

Speaker 2:          00:09:44       I guess I just don't understand why this is such a hassle for men. I don't understand why it's such an, unless you were raping people, assaulting people, hurting people, nothing's being taken away from you. And I feel like a lot of men thinks something's being taken away from them. And I don't know what that is. You know, and I'm just a little bit confused if it's unfollow me. I don't know. Unfollowed if it's blowing up your twitter feed and your instagram. I just, I can't wrap my head around why this is such an inconvenience for guys. So threatening

Speaker 1:          00:10:15       I don't think was that many guys that are saying this. Most men I think are recognizing that if you look at the stories like the Harvey Weinstein one is the worst and most egregious example, right? I mean, he's a guy that did it for decades. They even enabled him to bill cosby's worse, right? Because cosby was like, Harvey Weinstein was an obvious Predator. It's like, Hey, don't, don't go in the chicken coop with the wool.

Speaker 2:          00:10:41       And here's something interesting. I was also getting shit about this, about, um, a lot of people were like, well, if you knew about Harvey, why didn't you say something? And it's just, it's such a testament to how, um, who's someone said that. Yeah. Like I just got some comments that were like, well, you knew about Harvey, why didn't you say something? You know, when you knew about it 10 years ago or whatever it, you know, but I, I had heard like, Oh, he likes sleeps with actresses and he like makes them fuck them. But I wasn't really in that world, so I knew about it. But what was I going to call it? The New York Times, you'd be like, Hey, I was on comedy central for 10 minutes. I have an idea. Right. You know, like who was going to let you know? And it's also, it's like the kind of thing where we didn't even know what we were allowed to say and we didn't even know that there was a possibility for change or that there was a possibility that anything would be done about it. Like that's how I'm ingrained in our psyche. It was. And how we just didn't know there was anything. We just thought that's how it was.

Speaker 1:          00:11:31       Well, first of all, you didn't know him. You didn't work under him.

Speaker 2:          00:11:34       He did come to the comedy store ones. I think you were gone. And this isn't like my Harvey Weinstein story, like it's not close to how awful most of the women's stories are, but it is, I think more like kind of funny. He came to the comedy store and, uh, I, I went on stage to the main room and then I left. And then Tommy called me and he was like, oh, Tara Harvey Weinstein came to see you. Um, he's here, you need to come back and talk to him. And I was like, I was like already at the Improv are already like, whatever. And I was like, I don't want to go. And then the only reason I did not go back at first, I was like, fuck him for just like summoning me to come back. I'm making $22 at the comedy store. Like, I don't, you know, and uh, I'd already took me 40 minutes to get out of the comedy store parking lot.

Speaker 2:          00:12:14       I can't go back in there. And, uh, I remember literally just being like the lighting in there as bad. I don't want him to see me. The lighting on stage is great. Like he saw me at my best and I really don't want to go back and like talk to him. I don't like know how to do small talk with the producers. I'm not, you know, me, I'm like a neurotic mess. Like I'm not good at like charming and whatever. Um, but yeah, that's a crazy way to think of things. There was perfect. Yeah, that's a disaster. Like you saw me at my best, like, let me just get the fuck outta here. But like, I didn't know how bad it was, but I, you know, it's like the kind of thing that it's like we didn't know what we didn't know.

Speaker 1:          00:12:53       Feel a little guilty though. Like what you're saying, what I'm getting is that you've people saying that to you, that you feel like, ah, I didn't do it. I didn't, I'm not

Speaker 2:          00:13:01       totally, I think that there's a lot of women that kind of have done nothing wrong, but we're consumed with guilt and shame. Like, Oh yeah, I, I'm so glad to hear you say that cause I'm just not hearing a lot of that. I'm not hearing a lot of empathy and maybe I'm just like zoning in on negative comments.

Speaker 1:          00:13:14       Never had a female employee and I'd never worked in an office. But even though you hear all this sexual harassment shit and any ego, did I do anything? Yeah, you gotta you gotta check. It seems like everybody did something,

Speaker 2:          00:13:26       but it's like, but we were the same way. It's like, I mean I remember working on a talk show and everyone's like, oh well does that count? That's not as bad as like getting granular about it. Like I remember I worked on a, um, a talk show, late night talk show and a guy came up to me in front of like a couple of the writers and he took his hand and like put it between my butt cheeks and just went like swiped. And he was, looks like a credit card machine and like everybody started laughing. And of course I started laughing cause I didn't like froze and I was embarrassed. No, he was like my coworker, like, you know, and it was just kind of a Dick comedy writer and I was like, what do I do? What am I going to do? I mean at the time I had no concept that it was offensive. I was emotionally so naaman unconscious in my twenties like I didn't even think to do anything about it. But looking back, I'm like, that was fucked up. But what was I going to call human resources and say that it just, there's all these little tiny things that aren't enough to be assault but are too much to be appropriate. And it's just like a gray area that I don't, you know, it's, it's hard for us to, to delineate what makes sense of it.

Speaker 1:          00:14:27       Well it's funny how cautious you are now. I mean we're good friends, but we're joking around when we had these uh, hoverboards and we're rolling around these and you would not have caught me cause you didn't want to touch me. That's my fear. But which you said was hilarious. You, you were under to say something about, but you weren't sure if you could talk about it because you were worried that you bringing up the porn.

Speaker 3:          00:14:52       Yeah, but somehow or another be sexually harassing and I had to say like, Hey, that doesn't work. You can't do that to matt. Like you say, whatever the fuck you want. I ever give you license right now publicly say whatever the fuck you want. Forever. Can't sexually harass me. I didn't feel it too. Like, you know, I don't want to, you don't feel like, I don't want to be a hypocrite. You know? I've been coming back to the comedy store a lot and I hadn't been there in the last like six months. I've been working on something and I noticed when I used to go to the comedy store, I used to feel like pray or any company club. It was like, you know, people would hug you too long and you know, you were just waiting to kind of like have something inappropriate happened.

Speaker 3:          00:15:29       I went in the other night, not one man hugged me. Coloma lady like bowing at me. No one would come near me like I was a fucking leper. Donnell Rawlings came up to me and gave me a hug and halfway through he was like, Oh God, I'm so sorry. Am I allowed to do that? And it was just like, oh Whoa, like this is, this is fucking crazy. The tables have turned because it used to be women who are terrified of men and now men are kind of terrified or you're afraid of being called out. There's a lot of that. And a lot of guys going over the grade. If you don't have skeletons in your closet though, if you're afraid, if you don't, if you don't, are you afraid? Because you know you have some shit. Well, here's the thing, you don't have to have skeletons in your closet.

Speaker 3:          00:16:09       Sure. You can just have a bad relationship where someone's mad at you. Like, this is these and sorry thing, it's very bizarre. Like this seems like he went on a bad date and they took turns eating each other out and blown each other and then she didn't like it and she said that there was like, I don't know what the fuck happened cause I wasn't there. But there's a lot of people that are picking sides on this and here's, and I'm not accusing or supporting either side cause I don't think there's enough information yet. And it all seems very like he had one experience, she had one experience and if they're both telling the truth, you know, who fucking knows. But here's what I'll say, just about my experience in my twenties as a woman is I was not fully formed yet at 22 years old.

Speaker 3:          00:16:49       I didn't know. I had literally no sex. I wanted to have in my twenties I didn't want to have you understand that now that the frontal lobe is not really fully formed and human being cracked, cracked. So Hey guys in your thirties and forties stopped dating 20 year olds. Just in general. It's just a bad idea. You know, and I think that a really big part of the conversation that for me a blind spot is, um, sexual abuse victims. So the statistics are a little foggy, but like one out of six women are sexually assaulted as children and those are only the people that come forward is that real one on a six one out of six is, is, is the statistic for people that come forward that's not even including the people that don't come forward, which is a lot, which, um, and not to get too serious, but she didn't fucking Olympia, I'm sorry to interrupt you, but you see that Olympic thing makes me, it makes me crazy. The Olympic thing is insane. The Olympic gymnastics coach or doctor rather that was molesting all those girls, it makes me homicidal. And when they're doing the testimony, the girls that he's saying that this is too uncomfortable for him to listen to these girls

Speaker 2:          00:17:50       saw that guy on the street. I think I'd kill him, but my hands, I'd have to, I would go, I would go batshit crazy. So, um, I don't talk about this publicly because I'm too embarrassed. That's the other thing about this, I think that guys, some guys have this idea that us being sexually harassed is like fun for us and we like want to come forward and there's some glory in it. It's embarrassing and it's awful. And I don't talk about my sexual assault, um, publicly cause I just like freeze up. Can

Speaker 1:          00:18:15       you're very self aware there are people that take some sort of glory in being victimized.

Speaker 2:          00:18:21       Maybe I can't, I can't speak to that.

Speaker 1:          00:18:23       But I mean by that is to the point where they will exaggerate any sort of interaction with someone. So there's people but men and women,

Speaker 2:          00:18:33       I, so here's what I'll say, that that could be true. I don't know enough about the science of that. Um, and I'm not a psychiatrist, but my experience was the opposite. I minimize mine. I didn't how most people do. I didn't come to terms. The fact that I was sexual assault until I was 32, I'm 35. Like I just kind of figured this shit out. And there's a lot of stuff that is still blind spots that I don't want to deal with. And, uh, and I was only able to write about in my book because I just, I can't talk about it publicly. Like I freeze up, I get weird and scared and one of the trauma responses of if you've been sexually assaulted as a child is that when the man moves towards you or you have any kind of sexual, see, I'm like getting all nervous. When you have a sexual interaction, you freeze up because when you were sexually assaulted as a child, it didn't serve you to fight back and you had to kind of disassociate.

Speaker 1:          00:19:18       That's why people get confused with it. Fight or flight. It's not just fight or flight free trees.

Speaker 2:          00:19:23       One, I have a freeze response or I'm sorry,

Speaker 1:          00:19:25       clear about what I'm saying. So nobody misconstrues this what I'm saying? I'm not talking about real victimization. I'm talking about people that love to play the victim. Sure. There are a lot of people that, I don't know. I'm talking about real vic. When I say that is people take glory and victimization. I don't mean someone who's actually been sexually assaulted. I mean, someone who may have had a weird interaction with a person when they said something. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:19:47       And by the way, I've done that, like, um, you know, I get bumped at the comedy store and I'm like, can you fucking believe I got bumped? It's like I just am getting adrenaline and, and dopamine from like being self righteous or having been wrong or something. I, I know what you mean from that perspective, but I think when it's something real, yeah. My reaction is to complete as he is a big one. Yeah. So it's like

Speaker 1:          00:20:09       so big one with a salt. If people get, not just sexual things, but physical assault, a lot of, one of the things that happens to be when they're confronted by someone in a dangerous situations that panic and they freeze, they don't do anything. They don't, they can't, they literally can't move.

Speaker 2:          00:20:24       So if at least 20% of women have that, who knows what the fuck is going on in some of these interactions. So for me, like in my twenties when a guy came towards me, I would freak out. And people go, why didn't they say no? Why didn't they leave? Cause I'm fucking frozen and I don't know what to do. So

Speaker 1:          00:20:37       is that has never been involved in any sort of real altercation when they were in danger? Anyone? He says, why didn't you just, well you don't know why you didn't do things. But there's times my life when I look back, I'm like, why didn't I fucking say something? Yeah, but why? Why didn't I tell that guy to fuck off or what? You don't know what to do sometimes.

Speaker 2:          00:20:54       I mean that was me and my whole twenties. Why didn't I tell him? No, why didn't I leave? Why didn't I tell him to stop? Like you know, so, so a lot of it I didn't even understand cause I was too young too. And I also, I didn't, it took me 58 years of a 12 step program and therapy and Emdr to even be able to save Emdr, eye movement, reprogramming and desensitization. How the fuck would you expect anyone to know what that means, where you could just use your fans are so fucking smart and like there's such neurology nerds. Yeah, but that's off the deep end. You will, I need in my life it's uh, uh, post traumatic stress disorder or a therapy. Uh, it was started for um, uh, Vietnam vets and it helps you to sort of deactivate traumatic experiences. Have you ever done ecstasy? No. Yeah, it'll be,

Speaker 1:          00:21:41       therapy is supposed to be amazing for people that have gone through trauma or been told about this. Yeah. I'm going to go to Coachella next year and try that. I don't know if that's the place, but it's supposed to be amazing for people that have gone through real traumatic experiences that are so ingrained in their mind. Like the memories of those experiences are ingrained with trauma and horrible feelings and somehow or another MDM may therapy allows people to separate from that and, and lose the trigger and like lose, lose this, this right.

Speaker 2:          00:22:09       Sounds like a way more fun way to do it because Emdr is like you sort of have to relive the memory and then other shit gets on earth and things start clicking into focus.

Speaker 1:          00:22:19       Well, the reason why they call it ecstasies cause that's literally what you feel. You feel so much love and what, what his brain with dopamine. Yes. And I only did it once, but the thing that stunned me was how comparatively insecure I am in regular life.

Speaker 2:          00:22:35       Comparatively insecure. Can you say that again?

Speaker 1:          00:22:37       Comparatively insecure compared to when you're on ecstasy. Oh No. Inhibition. Zero. You're so friendly and so warm and so I try to be, yeah. Yeah. But when your, when you're on ecstasy you really realize like all the hitches in your personality or things that are holding you back. It made me, I only did it once, but it made me completely aware of insecurity that I didn't even know existed. Fascinating. Yeah, let's do that. Yeah, you do it. You'd trip out. It's very interesting. Super

Speaker 2:          00:23:05       into it. I had another friend, um, recommend that and I'd be down because it's also like, you know, and something else I'll say not to speak for all women, like I'm not the face of all women, but like with this administration, if you're a sexual trauma survivors seeing this fucking guy on the news every day can be really triggering post about the women's march is twitter literally can't read the news anymore because I'm too activated and I'm just, I'm, I'm, I'm going crazy. I'm way to activate it. Like seeing a sexual Predator or someone I deemed to be a sexual Predator with all the women that have come forward in the news every day is activating my trauma response of, I think he's a predator. I don't think it's just sexual. I think he's a Predator

Speaker 4:          00:23:46       and our business, I think he's a Predator politics. I think he's, I mean if you look at the way he campaigned, you know, like about the Hillary Clinton, lock her up, lock her up. This is predatory fines. Yeah. Well he, he's a, he's a fucking winner. I hate to say it that way. And I was, do you remember? Um, I think it was, I don't know if this was the primaries or it was like when Ben Carson was still in the mix and they were all lined up and I remember seeing, and this was when we all thought it was like a joke and he called all of them out. He was like, you've asked me for money and you've asked me for money and you've asked me for money. And I was like, that's fucking hot. Like this. The reptilian brain was like, oh shit. Like that guy's a fucking winner and he's not scared of anything.

Speaker 4:          00:24:28       And with the sound off, I'm like, that's the alpha. If Shit hits the fan, I'm following that guy's old. He's lived a long life. He's on speed. He's a malignant narcissist. The money. And there's all these reports that he's on diet pills. Do you believe that syphilis, Siri, I don't know that when you have, can you look this up as if you haven't already today though? No. Is that like caffeine or is it like he's on some sort of amphetamines? Apparently according to several sources. One of them that tracked his prescription from drain read pharmacy in New York from a few years back that he was on this one type of amphetamine for like eight years to take drug tests. If you're the president, and I don't even know, wow, this is amazing. You have to take a drug test. You work for ups, you don't have to take a breath test if you have the fucking nuclear football.

Speaker 4:          00:25:18       How is that not? Well, I dunno. It doesn't mean while Jeff sessions is fucking trying to take pot away from everybody and Donald Trump's popping pills, I don't know if he's really popping pills. I should say this, but what I've read is that what he's taking, what they believe he's taking his, do you remember phen phen phen phen was some shit that went, went on in the 90s it was a diet pill that they had to stop taking because it was a super effective for people, but it was essentially speed. They lost her appetite and he stepped back and everybody lost weight. Do you remember that Diet pill? I took that like when I was in high school and had an eating disorder that's similar. There's all these things are similar because they're amphetamines, they're speed, they're all, they're all, they're all stimulants and there's one of the ingredients in phen phen when the two of them are combined together.

Speaker 4:          00:26:05       Phen phen is two different things and see if he could find that story about what they think that he's on. It gives you delusions of glory of grand jury. That's the thing, like literally one of the symptoms. First of all, think about the amount of energy this guy had running for president giving these longs teachers never seem tired. Yeah. Dot. Rumer Donald doctor prescribed Donald Trump. Cheap speed. Fucking fixer. That bitch. She's amazing. Who made that picture? Who's Jim? Jim Cook. Jim Cook. You're a fucking wizard. Whoever you are, his neck looks like a fucking elephant. Applause. That made me laugh hard. The orange is perfect. It's like such an exact, but just

Speaker 1:          00:26:44       exaggerate. Just enough the eyes. Okay, you're enjoying this. He looks like your rock salt lamp. Got to be able to laugh while this is going on and you can't, you can't freak out. Okay. Rumors of trump's a predilection. I love that word. Predilection for stimulants first started really popping up in 1992 in spy magazine road. You ever wonder why Donald Trump has acted so radically at times full of energy of manic energy, paranoia and, wow, what does that word Garul lists careless. Darryl, you ever use that Word Darryl? This is like, I thought like cheerful, like garrulous. Hmm. Well your speed it up. Well, he was a patient of Dr. Joseph Greenberg's from 1982 to 1985 at the time, Doctor Greenberg was notorious for allegedly dolling out prescription stimulants to anyone who would pay blah, blah, blah, blah, blah diet drugs, which trump took a pill form and try it drugs and also be fat because he's eating a lot of terrible things. Oh, okay. This is the stuff. Okay. Okay. Fen Phen, it's called fin turn. Rameen first gain notoriety in the U s under the name phen phen a miracle combination of phentermine and fenfluramine another establish anti obesity drugs. The two of them together. The only problem was with the patients taking the drug began reporting damage to their hearts and lungs. Apparently the combination destroy the patient's bodies, so he's not taking both of them. He's taking one phentermine mean on its own. However, it's still prescribed.

Speaker 3:          00:28:08       Trouble with thinking, speaking or walking, decreased stability at exercise, false or unusual sense of wellbeing, insomnia, nervousness. And this is my suicide note. Increase in sexual ability, desire drive, not true confusion. Sure. I mean, so this is, this is doctor prescribed?

Speaker 1:          00:28:26       Yes. This is what I think. Why wouldn't you just take out all, well that's a good one. Yeah, but it's the same thing we bought adderalls syphilis theory. Trump adderall is essentially like incredibly similar. There it is a medical fear. Many mental health professionals believe the president is ill, but one of the causes and untreated std,

Speaker 3:          00:28:46       apparently syphilis untreated creates like, like reddening of the face, manic behavior, uh, the greater, but I can't read this. This face is Pale. It's orange skin color. Oh, is that self tanner? Yeah. If you look at his eyes, syphilis, why his eyes are white like all around his eyes, like a raccoon. There were white care. Okay. It's characterized by the development of an ulcer. Usually genital a few weeks in a few months after sexual contact with an infected person. If the is not, notice, not a secondary stage of the disease is seen in some patients weeks or months later. These patients may develop variety. Thank you. Have you, you're leaning. You're so upset cause I can't see rajshree right. I want to get to the um,

Speaker 1:          00:29:31       right behind you too. Oh.

Speaker 3:          00:29:32       Can't swivel. I hurt my back. I told you that I hurt my back on your fucking segue. Shine. Impress you. I'm suing you. Did following you. We have video cameras everywhere in this place. Do you know how to use a bow and Arrow? I'm not suing you.

Speaker 1:          00:29:48       Psychiatric disorder. Neurosyphilis symptoms or neurosyphilis or proteus. Proteus changing. Varying widely from one individual to another. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:29:57       Irritability, loss of ability to concentrate. Delusional thinking and grandiosity. Memory. Insight and judgment can become impaired and he's got everything in there duking it out inside of [inaudible] in the fucking eighties, from stormy Brown or whatever. And now he's fucking got delusional thinking and grandiosity. It's stormy brown hair loss. And then it also makes your hair like fluffy and just exactly what you said, fucking 90 years old, you're going to lose your hair. Uh, there's like a history of Israel and all those girls, females. Um, anyway, so I mean you can see why we're all a little triggered.

Speaker 1:          00:30:39       Yeah. But I don't think, I think that people are reaching for straws. I mean he just got, that was interesting. The doctor that examined him, examined him and said that he probably, if he had a good diet, he lived to be like 200 years old. These couches, great genes. That doctor that examined him, I was like, this is this doctor's doctor. The guy that killed Michael Jackson is his doctor. But here's the thing. After he did that, then Sanjay Gupta examine the actual results and Sanjay Gupta said, well, no, there's actually an issue here. And the issue is something to do with arteries and something to do with the potential for a future stroke or heart attack and he was going on. He was basing it on actual test results and obviously I don't know Jack Shit about medicine, but see if you could find out what he said. He's a common form of heart disease. Yeah. See a scroll up and see if you could find what it said there.

Speaker 1:          00:31:33       Yeah. Here it is. This is what it is. Doctor Ronnie Jackson disclosed trump's basic lab measurements, physical exam, and the conclusion of a cognitive exam known as the Montreal cognitive assessment. Additionally, the president had an echo cardiogram of his heart as well as the stress test. Both scrubs is normal, although is not a part of the official medical records that were released yesterday. After further questioning, Jackson also reveal the trump underwent coronary calcium ct scan. Now this is it. His score was one 33 in anything over a hundred indicates plaque is present at the patient has heart disease. According to trump's official records in 2009 his coronary calcium score was 34.

Speaker 3:          00:32:13       Does the president have an obligation to be in shape? I mean, wasn't Robert Taft like notoriously obese? Like do you have to be in shape to be the president? I don't know the answer. That's a good question. Like, do you, are there certain boxes you have to check? Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:32:27       What I'm getting out of this is it's Sanjay Gupta who is an unconnected third party who's unbiased, is going basically just offered these coronary calcium ct. And

Speaker 5:          00:32:40       what he's showing is the difference between how it was in 2009 which was 34 2013 which is 98 and then 2018 which is one 33. You're saying it's increased? Yes. Basically doubled every, it's bad. Couple of years is bad. Everything over 100 indicates heart disease. I'm not going to say anything else bad. I'm worried I'll get death threats. We worry that you want him to get this. No, I just, I, I just, you know, no one's on millions of fucking people. Um, you know, but I think that's the other thing. I think we're all sort of just, just especially angry. Like when you were talking about the pendulum swinging so hard of of women. It's like having to see this constantly, everyday in the news. This guy is, it's, it's hard. It's really hard and depressing trying to be objective. This is what I find fascinating about it is that obviously this is an aberration. Like no one's ever seen something like this before. No one's ever seen a president. There's a video that was on go to the typical liberal instagram page. There's a video of him saying no one is better at blank than him. And it's like a video that was actually put together by people to mock him. But the trump supporters actually love it. Yeah. Play this because 24 things, nobody is better at than trump.

Speaker 6:          00:33:58       Nobody can do it like me, nobody. Nobody can do it. Like nobody's stronger than me. Nobody has better choice than I do better at the military than I ain't. Nobody loves the Bible more than I do. Nobody builds walls better than me. Nobody's better to people with disabilities than man. Nobody's fighting for the veterans like I'm fighting for them.

Speaker 5:          00:34:18       Nobody that's done so much for equality.

Speaker 6:          00:34:21       There's nobody more pro Israel than I am. Nobody more conservative than me. There's nobody that respects women more than I would be tougher on Isis than Donald Trump. Nobody's ever had crowds like trump is crowds of people and they couldn't corroborate it. I know what it means. Nobody knows more about trade than me in the history of this country. Has ever known so much about infrastructure has Donald Trump? Nobody can do it like me. Nobody do.

Speaker 5:          00:35:02       You know, shed do the opposite. They're like, look, I'm not a scientist. I don't know that much about this. Like are more humble about it. I wish he wasn't president because I love him. I love what a character he is. He's entertaining. He's fascinating. That's fascinating. He has powers the problem. That's the problem. He's doing horrible to character and as the host of a reality show, he's a gem. I mean, it's such a free to be on a reality show. Great. Sign me up, but to be running the most powerful country in the world, I don't know, maybe China is now is it's really, really scary. Well, it's just fascinating, the supporters

Speaker 1:          00:35:38       too. Like I love reading his support his, cause I'm always trying to figure out which ones are Russians. Okay. How many of these are Russian? Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:35:44       A lot of them are women. There's a few that are women. Yeah. But what are those women voted for him? What's the deal with those girls? Um, you know, I, here's what I'll say, and I have some family who voted for him who are in, um, you know, exile, just working class. And their whole thing is like, we don't, we don't care. All we care about is the bottom line. Our jobs. It's actually kind of a luxury. Um, and that's, I think a fair flaw with what's happening with this. You know, women's movement conversation is right now, the people getting the most visibility or fucking millionaires, you know, that's sort of the, for the most part, who's speaking up right now. And like, you know, that's what time's up is for to enfranchise people who don't have the kind of resources to just be like, you know what, you're mistreating me.

Speaker 2:          00:36:28       I'm going to quit my job. You know, a lot of people can't quit their job and they have to tolerate sexual harassment and, and whatever. And they don't really have a choice in the matter of they have to stay in bad relationships because they can't afford to get their own place or whatever. But, um, but all they heard was jobs. Their thing is like, we don't care anything about his character. We think all politicians are assholes. We just want jobs. And that's what he said. He was gonna promise and he lied. You know, I'm, so, they were just like sort of played well,

Speaker 1:          00:36:52       isn't there more jobs now than ever before? And isn't the unemployment as low as it's ever been?

Speaker 2:          00:36:57       But he was, but he was promised, I mean, health insurance, I think they don't, they also thought that they were gonna get this like magical health insurance reform, which they didn't get, but there was also, um, he was promising like coal mine jobs, which is so crazy. My family members, like we're going to work in coal mines. I'm like, really? So that's 50,000 jobs, right? And there it starting to become obsolete. So he promised kind of jobs that I think the pipeline and shit like that. So I think that, you know, and they just watch Fox News and they believe everything that's been, they think like liberal news is a lie, you know? So I think it's like the kind of jobs that they promised. And I know, and I think that you're exactly right. It's like, um, their whole thing is unemployment going up is what helps women because more women can get John.

Speaker 1:          00:37:35       But isn't it a case where, when, when you see like unemployment and how more people were, uh, doing better than before and the economy is doing better than it's ever been before. Hey, isn't this like a natural cycle to like wasn't it already charting in that direction when Obama was leaving?

Speaker 2:          00:37:50       I was going to say, I think it's the president that's like four years prior. That usually is what causes it because you can't just like become president and all of a sudden there's more jobs. That's something that has to start a little bit earlier. I'm not saying Obama, I don't know. That's about it.

Speaker 1:          00:38:01       When Obama got into office, everybody was blaming him like right away,

Speaker 2:          00:38:05       even though that's probably what the president before him. Sure, sure. Here it goes. So let me

Speaker 1:          00:38:09       gain a net. Well, 11.5 million jobs, the unemployment rate dropped below the historical norm. Okay. 4% average weekly earnings for all workers were up 4.1% after inflation. The gain was 3.7% or just production and nonsupervisory employees after tax corporate profits also set records as the stock profits. S and p 500 index rose 166%. There was some story about how the tax break that we got here because of trump that people got, um, that California was going to somehow or another impart some sort of a 10% surcharge to counterbalance that. But, and I was like flat, but then that they said it was all going to like, uh, social programs. I'm like, well, that's a good thing. I'm all for paying more taxes if those taxes can go to poor communities. That's what I feel like. I feel like if there's one thing that we need to concentrate in this country is people that are disenfranchised and live in poor communities that don't feel like there's any hope. And then setting up community centers, setting up some, some education programs, setting up but safe places where kids can go and they don't have to worry about gang violence and shit and just making it safer for people and giving them more opportunities to possibly get out of that fucking horrible cycle of unemployment and, and, and fucking welfare and crime.

Speaker 2:          00:39:30       And if so many people are stuck, and I completely agree. And when I think about that, I'm like, oh you know, and this is just my point of view because of what I come from and maybe it's being a woman, a female brain, whatever. But like when I hear that I'm like the thing that perpetuates that cycle is having kids too soon and having a lack of access to birth control and education and this administration is a huge threat to that. An enemy to that. So I'm like what brain live? Why? What depletes you faster than a kid? Was that just a straight up Republican and pull this thing? I'm so sorry. I always have this problem. We don't have it like I always do this. Why? What does it say about me? Let me get like a fist. Do any of your other guests have this problem? Okay. Okay good. Okay. I used to do it before I did a podcast or radio shows. It always yell at me cause I wasn't in the mic. But why is it thing,

Speaker 1:          00:40:15       it's always a republican thing to try to deny women birth control to try to restrict abortion. This is always right

Speaker 2:          00:40:21       cause I think it probably boils down to religion and I don't know, I still can't understand why religion is the reason that people think women have to be cows. And if I could have ever for religious, this is what's so crazy. Yeah. Well he used to, I mean I think a lot of it's kind of like, keeps conveniently now super pro life or something. Nobody likes the Bible more than I do. Nobody hates abortion more than me. I wish I could do, I can't do an impression. I was just thinking. You don't, you don't, it's chilling. I don't, I don't, I don't want to hear it. Last thing we need is more fucking trump impressions at the comedy store. I'm good. Um, but uh, the burn has a really good one. Really? It's really, it's really good. I would not have seen that coming. I didn't see it coming either.

Speaker 2:          00:41:00       He did it the other night and went, Woo. He nails it. That's kind of amazing. And he nails it. Yeah. I have to process that later as the finger thing. That's great. I mean, Alec Baldwin's is like fucking just, yeah. But um, but yeah, I think it's religiously sort of based and uh, and Hubris based. I mean just the idea that women shouldn't have control over their own bodies. It's just like, why do you want me to have kids that I'm not ready for it? What seats are, um, economic system. It means everyone else has to pay more taxes. It puts more people on welfare. All the things that Republicans hate

Speaker 1:          00:41:30       did. It's a vulnerability thing. They like women to be vulnerable maybe. Hmm. Maybe. And what they want control, right.

Speaker 2:          00:41:36       Control over it. Yet we have complete control over people they'd never met. Why do you want to control the uterus of a woman that lives 10 states down from you? How does that

Speaker 1:          00:41:42       benefit? There's a sick thing that people have where they want to control people in a lot of ways. I think that's a lot of, when you see people that are trying to control people's language, when you see people are trying to restrict, don't say this, say this, we're don't say this isn't a weird instinct that we need to address. When you are outside of ideology, outside of you know, political lines that you cross. There's a weird instinct that people have to try to control people.

Speaker 2:          00:42:07       It's just a fear based sale

Speaker 1:          00:42:09       I habits or thing that people do, they don't have much control of themselves and they want to control their people. And I think this is where bullying comes from and I think this is where a lot of what sexual harassment and just the entitled meant the, the way bosses behave when they're employed. Like this is one of the things about Harvey Weinstein and I've found found fascinating is that he would bark it as employees and it would run and they were terrified and ice date a girl. And she was a, when I first came to La, wonderful woman, beautiful, perfect personality, terrified of her boss. She worked as an agent's assistant and she couldn't have been an actual person. Yeah. And this girl would wake up in the middle of the night, terrified. Sure. That her agent that she was working for needed her to do something. She would freak out. Sure. She was like constantly worried. And this guy, I mean, she made terrible money. It was constant stress and she'd work insane hours. I mean they would make, she would make like $400 a week and she was working fucking insane. This is before they had the rules of, yeah. You know, you don't know what she really made. I'm just guessing. But she was always broke.

Speaker 2:          00:43:14       And then my questions for you or that it's in Stockholm Syndrome, super rail saying yes. And then what was her relationship with her dad where she recreated her childhood circumstances? It wasn't done. That wasn't good. Yeah. The relationship and then the epigenetic imprinting. It's, it's only till very, very recently that we were not completely dependent on men for our survival and that you guys weren't killing us in the street. I'm like, it's so recent in terms of human evolution and um, you know, I did this movie with Neal Brennan and uh, we wrote a song called again called the female brain. And it's about all the shit cause I'm obsessed with figuring out and you're so good at delineating what's nature and what's nurture, what's a choice and what's not. With biologically neurologically driven and what's socially constructed. I'm, that's my fascination in life. And like when all this stuff happens, I'm always trying to figure out this kind of behavioral stuff.

Speaker 2:          00:43:59       And then that we had talked a lot about epigenetic imprinting. So it's like even if your girlfriend at the time had not gone through some sort of trauma with a man, her mom certainly dead. And then her mom's mom certainly dead and she carries that with her. So all of a sudden you're in 2016 and a man is yelling at you and it's like flash back to 1850 when like one of your ancestors was being fucking murdered by a guy. You know, like we just don't think about that kind of stuff. But what I meant to say is, um, Neil had, we used to have the storyline that was about sexual harassment. We ended up kind of changing it. It's successfully strong and Blake Griffin a storyline about her. Um, because women are generally for consensus, we get dopamine from consensus, right? Because we are physically weaker.

Speaker 2:          00:44:35       I know nobody wants to talk about it. And when you mean by consensus, what do you mean? In terms of like if you guys are arguing about something, I mean, we're on a show that kind of encourages, you know, healthy discourse and I know you guys a little bit and I feel safe here, but in general, in a work environment, I'm going to try to get everyone to agree because 2000 years ago, getting everyone to agree made my life safer. If I'm eight months pregnant, I need protection from the whole tribe and I want everyone to agree. I'm going to pretend I agree with things that maybe I actually don't, don't make sense. We get dopamine from harmony because I'm less able to defend myself, especially with men. I need you to like me because I need your protection. Right? We're not that different. I mean, 200 years ago I needed your protection. Like my brain has not caught up to the fact that like it's illegal for you to attack me and break me now. You don't need anything though. I think it means something to our reptilian brains.

Speaker 4:          00:45:25       You know? Legal part doesn't mean anything. That's true. No one, no one's going to save you.

Speaker 2:          00:45:30       Totally correct. That's correct. You could kill me or whenever you wanted, but 200 years ago it was like, you know what w w there was no phones to even call it a report anyway. It was just much more common. Yeah,

Speaker 4:          00:45:40       I get what I'm saying today that like on anyone saying that that fears alleviated because there's laws against it as crazy. Totally. Those fears are always there.

Speaker 2:          00:45:49       Completely. Yeah. My reptile brain, just in my conscious brain, I'm sort of like, okay, it's less likely that this is going to happen because we all have this illusion of being civilized. You know?

Speaker 4:          00:45:57       That's all horse shit. I get nervous when I interview Francis and Gando after a fight, like when I got, when I had to interview him Saturday night, cause he's 265 pounds and six foot four and he smashes people's heads and for living and I stand next to him and I feel like a little tiny person. There's just no getting around that. And here's the thing and that's why it's like that. He likes me. I know he's not going to do anything to me.

Speaker 2:          00:46:16       I see what you're saying to me right now is what I'm trying to explain to people that are like, I'm nursing the Fuckin Women's moon. Why are you guys freaking out in the office? It's not like we're talking to those people. It's, it's like, what are we going to rape you? It's like,

Speaker 4:          00:46:26       yeah, maybe I don't get an elevator's with guys. I just wait for the next one. I'm scared. We have tribal thinking. It's in. This is right now there's a tribal boundaries that are being established on the male and female side and people are picking sides and there's a bunch of men that are annoyed that people are talking too much about women. Yeah, and there's a bunch of women that are saying, now it's my time to be a fucking crazy bitch and go crazy and attack all these men and take dad tried to go at all, but there are some, but there are so I know what I'm saying is see, see you saying that right there. Yeah. We are not trying to do this. Yeah. That's a crazy thing to say because you're not all women. It's all in together. I'm not all men. That's crazy.

Speaker 4:          00:47:03       Don't know anybody like that. I do. I don't who were on instagram. People crazy. Yeah. I follow a lot of really insane people on instagram. There's a lot of, like, there was a woman that was, she's like an editor for vogue or something like that that said, here's an unpopular opinion. I am not at all concerned with men being falsely accused of sexual harassment or sexual assault. That's irresponsible. But they exist. Those people exist. There's the burn it all down people. Yeah. That fuck them or burn it all down. Yeah. It doesn't matter. It doesn't matter. It's inherently tribal. Sure. This is a tribal thing. Yeah, and it's not, there's no nuance to that. There's no consideration of all the different kinds of men. I, there was a lot of men that are considerate and friendly and nice and they don't, and they're, they're concentrating on themselves and they don't want anything bad to happen to anybody else.

Speaker 4:          00:47:53       But then there's men who like, fuck these bitches. Yeah. Fuck all women. All. They're all whores bitch and they listen to rap music like, yeah. I've been listening to a lot of like really bad rap music lately. Dennis, one of the rare places where you could still just be a straight up massage. And then do you think, and I'm always, and I don't know the answer to this, do you think, cause I think porn definitely affects our psyche and how we view w dehumanize women just just right. Especially young people watching it. Do you think that a rap song going destroy that Shit, murder that shit, beat that pussy up. Do you think that that affects the way men view women on like a cellular level? It's, it's impossible that it doesn't, it's impossible. When you have something that's incredibly popular and you're repeating the words to it over and over again, I don't know what percent of an effect it has on a 20 year old brain. Right. Whether it has a 5% effect, you know over your parenting and what your life experience is a bit. Yeah. All the various different variables that come into your, your psyche. Like what? What? What makes you a human being? I don't know, but that's a factor. It's a factor

Speaker 3:          00:49:01       and is in what is in what happens when you hear beat that pussy. Like is that, why? Do guys cheer for that? Like aren't we also kind of on some level wire to protect? Why isn't it like I'm not, I'm swearing too. Is that a Tampon? Tattoos. What is that? Oh it's a safety pen. Oh yeah. I'm trying to figure out what the fuck that I do is on your wrist. What kind of monster do you think I am? What kind of monster would get a slow burn it all down like a, it's like a, it's like a personal thing. Okay. It's too, it's too much of a mom or you don't want me to tell you. Most of my tattoos are white. I have white ones everywhere you are fucking crazy. Here's what I will say is that burn it all down. We'll talk that doctors or why I wanted the payment. I didn't want anybody fucking 5,000 tattoos. You're covered. Why am I crazy? Cause you can't see mine to say saying I'm not crazy. I'm crazy. I'm probably pretty crazy. Yeah. You hide it very well. You channel it, you manage it in healthy ways. Yeah. You get it out. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          00:50:01       Oh, if I didn't matter, if you didn't work out every day, would you just be monitoring and keeping you in the streets? Probably been to jail a long time ago. You wouldn't be like breaking apes out of zoos and fighting them. I don't think that, but I think I would have done something really stupid a long time ago. Yeah. Yeah. I, but I think that there's a lot of men that have terrible, uh, genetics and instincts and environments that they grow up in and there's a lot of violence in your life and you

Speaker 5:          00:50:28       will either find a way through that or, yeah. For me, the, the way through it was martial arts. If I didn't find martial arts, who knows. Yeah. And I think that is one of the best ways for men to not be pieces of shit to know. Cause I think a lot of the way people behave is to insecurity. I think a lot of pride in other things so that you have watch a San Duexis is it give you dental help too, but give you some security and give you an outlet for your aggression and give you some humility. Like in martial arts you get humility, you get strangled all the time. You, you learn humility.

Speaker 5:          00:51:02       You can't have any ego will you do it to them? They do it to you are, but he does it and you hug and there's like real genuine love and affection between the guys that I do Jujitsu with. It's very, it's, it's, it's very intense. It's as real as it gets. And here's something, sorry, I just wanted to go back to that vogue woman for a second or whoever that was because it's like, I think what I'm trying to do is understand like what a man acts in a way that's violent or whatever. I'm like, what's the root of that? What's going on? What happened in his childhood? Like what's going on biologically are genetically, or like what has he been taught? Like he was failed somehow. If a guy feels the need to like rape a woman, someone failed him or he's a sociopath and just should be locked up or as mentally ill, but like he saw it from his dad, he learned it hurt people hurt people.

Speaker 5:          00:51:44       So it's like when a women says like all men should, I don't care if they're felt like, I'm like what happened to her that made her think that that's an okay. That's her paradigm. I probably met a bunch of fucking assholes that something went wrong. Yeah, it was probably guys that she grew up with, guys that were in her life. The sexual traumas. Totally. There's a lot of variables and I guess I'm just trying to start a conversation. It's like let's explore what happened back then and how do we sort of stop that shit from going on. Whether it's like sexual abuse, physical abuse, whether it's like the messages we get growing up of like, and I don't know how you parent your kids, but the idea of like all I heard growing up as calm down, relax, it's fine. Be Seen that like the messages that we give kids, calm down, relax before about what?

Speaker 5:          00:52:29       Anything. Anytime I cried or I was injured or whatever, it was, calm down. You're overreacting. That's what I heard as a kid growing up. I think it did because overreacting, it caused me to, I mean, I was a kid. I don't know when we, when kids, kids should be assured like it's okay. It's just a small booboo and you're going to be fine. Normally what kids do when they're crying, it's they're just testing to see how available you are to them. Right? So when you go calm down, everything's fine. Let me teach. I don't know enough kids. They do that. But then they also recognize that it's a way that they can get attention. So they will overreact on purpose about them. Yes, they will have fits if they don't go to the movie. They like to see, like if my two daughters want to go see a movie and one of them wins and the other one starts throwing a temper Tantrum, you gotta go, look, we're going to go see a fun movie. Right? Like you can't get pissed off next time you'll get to choose. Yeah. This is crazy. You can't stomp your feet and cry, but she's seven. Yeah, totally. This is like, I have a chance explain

Speaker 4:          00:53:26       to her that he, these feelings are natural light. Yeah. You're gonna win some, you're gonna lose some, but you can't hold on to that. You've got to let it go and realize, oh, we're still going to go to go to see a fun movie. Right. It's just not going to be this one. It's going to be that one. Right. And you know what, for whatever reason we made a decision. Sure. You know, and we try to be as fair as possible, but you can't have fucking temper tantrums over and all the time, oh, we're going to the wrong restaurant that, you know, kids do that. Sure. That's because they're little kids. They're recognizing that there some influence that they have some power over you.

Speaker 2:          00:53:56       And then I'm going to see how much power I can get. Yeah. And how much attention I can get and how much I can play you. So you just have to figure out the difference. I think for me, I learned to invalidate my own reality and stuff. My field I ever met. I remember a specific moment where I was like, you can't rely on adults. They won't help you figure it out yourself or don't have those feelings are and validate those feelings, you know? And I think there's probably a that it's bad parenting. You know what your kid did go like if I'm hurt, don't tell anyone because parenting is

Speaker 4:          00:54:21       fucking confusing cause you try to figure out what, what bad parenting you received. I was lucky in that my parents were very busy so I didn't get a lot of parenting. Yeah, me too. Same Way. So it wasn't, it wasn't like I got bad parenting. I didn't get back there. Yeah. Don't let anybody who is mean to me. Yeah. I just got, yeah, it was alone a lot. But then I found things to occupy my time. So that literally became like those obsessions that I, that I developed when I was young with various things, whether it was art or martial arts or whatever. Those things became my vehicles for developing my human potential. And that, do you think you got a lot of eye contact as a kid? I never thought about that until just now

Speaker 2:          00:55:05       fairly. That's a big one. Eye contact, eye contact and physical touch in the first couple of years

Speaker 4:          00:55:09       we're affectionate. My family's always been affectionate. It's always been huggy. Yeah. You know, and I'm real hug you with my family too. I think and I'm hugging with my friends too. I think that's super important and I think it's also a very important to tow your friends. Like I tell everybody I love them.

Speaker 2:          00:55:24       Yeah, that's awesome. I mean I know I got really into John Bowlby, Siri of attachment because I couldn't make eye contact until like two years ago. Like I would always kind of look here. Yeah. This is how I used to always look at people and then I just recently started making I and make, it still makes me a little bit uncomfortable. It's like a muscle, but I had something called infant maternal disruption, which is basically you just didn't get enough eye contact. So apparently the amount of eye contact and doesn't know this because I'm, cause I can't make it now.

Speaker 4:          00:55:50       But isn't that just an insecure guy? I used to get real insecure. I've talked about this before or talking to a bank teller. I'd freak out why? I get nervous. I was nervous, but only bank tellers or just anywhere. I remember being in the bank getting ready to deposit a check and in line, just two people ahead of me was the times of the comedy story. You didn't know if it will go through. That was before the way before then. It was before I did comedy.

Speaker 2:          00:56:14       Was it, did it, did it had anything to do with a man or a woman?

Speaker 4:          00:56:16       No. No, it didn't matter. It's just, I just was nervous talking to people.

Speaker 2:          00:56:20       That's so interesting. I like that too. Like the couple of minutes you talked to me all the time. I get a little shade, like I'm socially awkward in the beginning and then I sort of settle in. But I, I do get a little shaky when I first talked to people even now.

Speaker 4:          00:56:31       Well, I feel that with you. I feel like I have to say we're friends, we love you. We're friends, we're friends, right? Yes, we're friends right away with the porn and the hoverboards you like this is really shouldn't bring this up. Like what are you talking get whatever the fuck you want to say.

Speaker 2:          00:56:48       Um, you know, and I, and I also have this condition called codependence. I'm working on it. Um, but I'm fucking dealing with it. It's expensive to handle. It's very time consuming to rewire your brain around it. But when I first meet someone, it's like a, it's like a chameleon response where it's like, um, when you grow up in an alcoholic home or if you have codependence the first thing you do is you meet someone and you kind of try to figure out what they want and then you morphed to become what makes them comfortable. So I still have to fight that response sometimes, especially with, especially with men and then with women because though we didn't do that for sure. Like are you in a football are going to be like who is this guy and how am I going to make him like me? That's kind of what codependence

Speaker 4:          00:57:28       well men do that with other men but they also do that with women. They'll become like what the woman wants. Like women will. I see it a lot of times my friends with the way they dress like the woman who come along. Yeah. Well also the women are mold men. Like women will get men in shape. Like you should just lose someone

Speaker 2:          00:57:43       like in a relationship. I just mean like when I first meet someone my instinct is kind of like how do I make an a specialty with it? It has taken me so long to not be funny when I'm not doing stand up. Cause like the for my first instinct is makes this person laugh, make them like you and I kind of have to like manually be like turn that shit off. You're not five and you're not trying to get the approval of your dad. Like not your dad

Speaker 4:          00:58:03       turn it off. But what if you just see something funny, you're still free enough to just be funny.

Speaker 2:          00:58:08       Can do that. But it's like, my motive is not, I'm trying to make this person told me my

Speaker 4:          00:58:12       all the time. You know the people who are on all the time, just say his name, his name, genuinely. Brian isn't trying to get anyone to know he's not getting it, but he's just really funny and he loves being that Brian is at its best. And I've said this before, there's an innocence to it. He's at his best in a group of people. Correct. Not on stage. He's out of around 20 people. If you've got 20 people and they're going somewhere, Brian's on guys. Guys, guys just want to show you something. He'll just, he'll just be this. He's fucking, I've never met anybody that makes me laugh harder just in groups of people other than Joe Diaz kills me. But Joey Diaz is the opposite. Joey Diaz is not trying to do,

Speaker 2:          00:58:57       he's just naturally, it's not a performance. I just wonder Brian callen knows the difference anymore. Like is there a certain point where you don't even, you can't even tell when you're performing and when you're not. It's like just tease, morphed, doesn't matter. He doesn't care. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          00:59:08       He has a bizarre ability to not fair. If people were upset at him, it's like he's got this weird almost Peter Pan, like way of moving through life.

Speaker 2:          00:59:18       It's cracked. I am, I am in therapy and a 12 program to get the inner monologue of Brian Callan. If I could just have an iota of the self esteem that he has. Do you do meditate? I do. I lost my dad last year and meditate like suddenly and my meditation, I started getting too sad. Like I couldn't close my eyes for 20 minutes, so I've stopped for the past like six months. But I'm trying because I need to build those neural pathways.

Speaker 1:          00:59:42       Well, I feel like you're always, do you know that feeling when you're running down a hill or it's super hard to stop this momentum? It's like, Whoa, Whoa, whoa, Whoa, whoa. You're still up. But it's fucking, it's tricky. That's how I feel. You are like you're running on a slight angle, you know, you're not flat.

Speaker 2:          01:00:00       Yeah, it's not, you're, you're always like a little, ah, I'm fucking, I am sometimes. Um, I think in the last, yeah, I agree. I'm trying to answer in a way that, uh, makes you seem wrong, but I realize you're, you're pretty right. And I think that also in the last couple of years that we've gotten to know each other I hadn't been doing is not as much stand up. And when I don't do standup, I get a little manic. I think that standup serves a really important like release and Catharsis purpose where I'm much more calm when I'm not performing. When I do stand up right here,

Speaker 1:          01:00:32       get it out right. You get out those thoughts, these, these antagonistic protagonistic thoughts, all these deer weird little ideas that are wrestling in your head. Like you can put them into a comedy form and then deliver that. I'm on stage. It's a very cathartic way of releasing ideas sometimes. And then when the audience laughs, you know, and you're like, ah, I nailed this. I'm on to something here. I got it.

Speaker 2:          01:00:55       And there's just, I think that, you know, again, not to beat the, I come from a, we as we all do tricky home and I think that my brain seeks a con control or even a false sense of control. Soothes it. And when I do standup, you kind of get to have control for at least the 20 minutes or an hour that you're on stage and everything feels like it's an order. I know my place. You know your place. It is a very clearly defined rules. I'm talking, you're laughing, I'm talking, you're laughing. And that makes me feel really calm. Whereas going through the world with like, I don't know who you are, you're dangerous. I don't, you know, like I have a hyperactive Amygdala, so it's like during the day I'm just very dysregulated and doing standup is just, I don't know, I just feel very like, I know where everybody's places and I feel safe for that amount of time.

Speaker 2:          01:01:36       Do you get calmed down by working out a little bit? Because my motive for working out is so fucked up. It's not like, you know, I'm working more on like working out to get strong and to get healthy. But for the longest time it was like to get skinny and to look fuckable, you know? So working out was like, I was kind of hate fucking it. I wasn't like doing it because I enjoyed it or wanting to be doing it. So I'm trying to sort of find a new motive. Um, we'll kind of exercise. Do you do, I get bored and I used to work with a trainer and I stopped and so I started just started doing it myself, like lifting and I've just want to have a big butt. That's all I really care about. I'm just won an ass. So I'm like, used that machine. Is it called the Jimmy John Vinci? I don't know

Speaker 5:          01:02:20       the one that likes Jimmy Dean each immedion sausage to make my ass bigger than, do you know what I'm talking about? It's a, it's a squat machine, but it has like a little helper has little claws. What does that, this machine is the, uh, the, the rack where the squat goes up and down. It's just taught, turn it forward to catch it. Why don't you add to that? Yeah, that's a good machine to do. It's good. It's good to do on your own. That's actually just, Oh yeah, that's a Smith machine. Yeah. That's what I do at the gym. Cause those are good. And then I do a lot of people don't like those because you don't have to balance them. No. The idea is that there's, there's a benefit to all the stabilizing muscles. Like if you have a real, uh, a real bar, I'm sure you do to add.

Speaker 5:          01:03:05       If I do that when I'm afraid I'll hurt myself. The Jimmy John Helps me to not, I'm not like a professional athlete. I'm just like, should get a hug in pill form, take it five times day, whatever. He just getting, everything's going to be in here, get a pill form. But uh, I was doing like soul cycle. I was doing like spinning for a while just because whatever, there's a great episode of the unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt, man. You ever watch that show? No. It's funny though. I've seen a couple episodes. Hilarious. Gray went down for like two episodes and I almost abandoned it. Tell you folks if you're watching it now, because I've talked a lot of people in to watching it. When you get to like episode six of season one, don't panic. It's sucks for two episodes and then it bounces back wrong. It's hilarious. And they made fun of spinning.

Speaker 5:          01:03:54       Oh there's one with a nick kroll and he's, he's the spinach truck and I don't want to give it up to any of that but, but it's like, it's a cult, these fucking soul cycle. Cycle and cry. I'm not fucking kidding. They'll play like sheryl crow or like pain. Like Neil, Brendan always says that I have the musical taste of a 45 year old divorcee. I love an inspirational Kelly Clarkson time. I swear to fucking God. Sheryl crow, Alana's Morissette. I will just get in there and you just start crying because you were in a lot of pain and you're working really hard and you're just vulnerable and we feel like it's okay to cry cause you're sweating and it's like no one's going to know sweater tears. It's me and a bunch of book publicists crying, but Jim Publicist, cause it's $35 a fucking class. It's crazy. You know that much. I mean if you buy like a hundred packages, it ends up being like 28 I have a thing called a Peloton bike. Oh that's the, no, no, I tried it. It's supposed to be amazing. I tried somebody else's do a live spin class with people. We have it here. So do you just spin it and you like it? No, they give it to me. I use it, but I have one here.

Speaker 5:          01:05:05       I can get in a groove and I can check out and think about other things and it's like a moving meditation for me. That's how I feel about regular running. When I run the hills I love running, but now I'm running with my dog. It's a different because I always have

Speaker 4:          01:05:18       to keep an eye on him, but he's pretty good. He waits and waits for me and then I run and he's so much different than any dog. She's just following now. He's just running amazing. Yeah, he's great. He's great, but he's not at all. My other dogs have been psycho so I've had to have them on leashes cause they would attack their dog dug holes. I had a bunch of pit bulls so I'd run with them and you know, and my masters, I just never ran with him. He's too fucking big. This thing is bad for, it's hard on their bones. He's limping a little bit too. He runs around too much in the yard. He loves. Yeah, he's huge. They're too big. There was sort of meant to just hang out and I'm running really steep inclines. Golden retriever. Yeah. That's great. That dog is, that's great for them.

Speaker 4:          01:06:00       Running with animals, the best feeling. But me and him have this crazy bond that's like when we stop, I'll stop on a run the hills. I'll pause cause it's like, you know, I'm running this big sprint up to the up the hill and then he'll, he'll sit and wait with me and then he just like, I love you when they like jump up and kiss me. And I'm like, I love you too buddy. Like calm down. But it's like he's so excited that I do this with them. He loves it. We have grateful, oh yeah. This crazy bond thing going on. Yeah. That makes me so happy. It's really intense. But yeah, I've always been like, he's a sweet dog. I bonded with them from the moment we got him. Yeah. But we have this extra bond now that we run three or four times a week. Oh yeah, totally. We'll you're a pack. Yeah. A pack together. And then if you're running, you guys have a date. He found some shit. I don't know if it was his shit cause usually shits in this area and he just laid down on it, started rubbing on it,

Speaker 2:          01:06:48       dog to hike and he came back. He lie, like let him go. I was like, all right, let's see how this goes. Let's see if this is going to end the lawsuit for me. And uh, so I let him go. He comes back, he's covered in like, he smells like, like wharf. I can't even explain the rancid smell. I was just like, what is that? And he's covered in like, he's got like stringy licks. I'm like, I said Spaghetti and then I keep walking. There's a dead deer. He had rolled in a dead deer carcass. Oh, so you get all the water was just covered in worms and guts and eyeball. And I was like, Oh fuck now I, I'm, you're up for adoption. Weird dogs like they like smell because don't they do it? Cause my dogs, um, when a po, coyotes, coyotes. Um, when coyotes, ah, shit in my yard, my girl roles in it. Cause don't you do it so that the coyotes think you're on the pack so they don't kill you. Ooh, I think that's what you do at wow. Fire up that Google and make sure I'm not wrong. Yeah, they roll in the shit so that the coyote doesn't kill them.

Speaker 4:          01:07:46       There's a guy I follow on instagram that has a pet coyote and he hunts coyotes and he uses this pet coyote help them hunt coyotes. I know like this person dogs and they hunt. Cut. Well, hunting coyote is important in areas where coyotes attack deer. Fawns and coyotes. Is this in California? No, no, he's, he's a hunter. I mean the guys that just a hunter period. One of the things that he's done, he found a puppy, a coyote puppy that had been abandoned

Speaker 5:          01:08:16       and so he adopted it and she lives with them. It's really weird. Coyotes can attuned to human faces. Like they're basically sociopathic. They, they're not like dogs. You can't domesticate them. Yeah, maybe not true because this dog seems to be very playful with him and like cause biting his hand and I looked at and then, but not hurting him and these, he's petting it and the dogs, it's playing with other dogs, you know, but you can raise, cause it's like it's a baby and work with these, this place wolf connection. And essentially it's like, I'm always like, well which one's the most wolf? Which one is the highest content of Wolf? Wolfen it like with the blood and they're like, it doesn't really matter. It's back to the nature nurture thing. It's that there are some wolves that were raised by dogs that have more doglike qualities and some dogs are raise like waltz and have more wolf light qualities.

Speaker 5:          01:08:59       It's like the nature and nurture thing. Yeah, that makes sense. This Chi, this is what does it got rolling and feces. They're really common and possibly dogs, ancient instinct to mask his sent, which then able to animal to sneak up on their prey without detection. Ah, so you might keep her. So all I guess dogs do it with other dog poop as well. But my dog doesn't roll in my other dog shit. Only Coyote Shit. Why does it, you know what I mean? So anything or fucking tanks, huge. They're probably not worried about a fucking coyotes hunt in fucking packs and they learn are one and they surround them. And tell you the story about the guy who worked at the pet food store. I worked at a pet food store, also worked at a veterinarian's place and they got this dog in, it was one of those giant pit bulls, one of those like hundred and 20 pounds and muscular damn pit bulls.

Speaker 5:          01:09:47       And it was covered with cuts all over its body. We're cool card, hundreds and hundreds of stitches. And so he asked the owner like, what happened was, I don't know. He goes, I came home and he had gotten out of the yard. He was covered in blood. It was all fucked up because I don't know what happened. And so, uh, they stitch the dog up and then they fall, literally follow a blood trail up into the hills where he finds nine dead coyote, his pit bull. They lured him in and then the coyotes ambushed him and he killed the mall. It's, he goes, it was like Homie, right? That exactly. It was like Vietnam, dude. He was like, just next ripped open guts, torn apart. Arm snapped off. He goes, this, this pit bull just killed the pitbull had a head like a fucking fire and their muscles are in their head.

Speaker 5:          01:10:34       Yeah. It was a monster. Don't I had my ear bitten off by one? Yeah. It happened so fucking fast. I didn't, I didn't feel anything. Then you said it didn't mean mean to do it. Just paint didn't mean it. It was like it, it does. I don't have to defend it if we talked about it on the vodcasts. Right. So it's like, but I just go fucking fast. I didn't even feel it. I felt no pain. That's how fucking precise it was. So they say about shark bites, then you don't, you don't feel the shark bite until you realize your legs missing. That girl Bethany, she said it was like an orgasm. It was like bliss cause so much dopamine rushes to the area so that you keep fighting like it actually felt good thing. I'm comfortable about a 13 year old talking about orgasms. Oh God, we're going

Speaker 4:          01:11:13       to jail. We're going to jail. Maybe I'm, maybe you're, maybe I'm putting that in there cause I want to fuck a shark. Sorry. Don't see me play. I do feel myself walking on egg shells around anything sexual all the time. Now a woman, I would say this right now, you can say whatever the fucking next, you know women are next and they shouldn't be. They should, if women are predators and using their power to coerce people, they should. If you see my Harvey Weinstein bit, you haven't seen it? No. Okay. I'll, I'll, I'll, I'll see you Wednesday. Yeah. Wednesday. Yeah, for sure. But I don't, that's, that's nonsense. Any God, well, there are, I know guys that have been victimized by women at work. It was a guy, a tj. Remember the amazing atheist was telling the story about the woman that he worked with. Zoe's always grabbing his ass and making them uncomfortable.

Speaker 4:          01:12:00       And she was like his boss. He was real socially awkward and in this fucked up situation. But that's super rare. And I think that this is a balancing thing. And then this, this, uh, you don't want to thought it was the most hilarious thing about the women's march that um, people were angry that these white women were wearing pink pussy hats because not all women have the justice because not all women have vaginas because there's trans women. No, women have that too because women of color, it's both their offensive to women of color and Trans Women. How many trans women were marching in the women's March and I didn't know they were trans based on their appearance. Calm Down Internet. I know them personally, so I knew that they would train and Bluto oh, sniff them out for this fucking dude. I'm a comedian. There was a thread on my twitter that I wasn't even involved with where these trans people and these lesbians were going at it back and forth and it was fascinating because lesbians are one of the few groups that don't feel intimidated to talk shit to trans people.

Speaker 4:          01:13:09       They're like [inaudible] against the, yeah, and they were saying that these trans people are homophobic and these trans women can't get it. It was fucking crazy. It was for days, for seven or eight days that we're going at it back and forth, but essentially the Trans Women, this is what the lesbians were saying, that the va, the violence, the intersection, no, it's not the way you know the violence between women, women on women, violence in relationships, domestic violence. The statistics were skewed because a lot of it is trans women that were attacking women that they were in relationships with because these women that are trans women, they have the same behavior that men have, which the inclination towards domestic violence check. And so they were saying that and she was citing statistics about how many of these women that were the, the, the victimizers were not, they weren't, they would not specify their gender at birth. They were talking about their current gender in, which is like a weird thing now. You don't have to like, you could arrested if you're a

Speaker 5:          01:14:12       trans woman for beating up a woman and they will say, okay, well you're a woman. And they'll say, yes, I am a woman. You're born a woman, right? It's none of your fucking business. Like, oh, okay. So there was this really deep, that's fascinating because one of these lesbians had started this with these trans women was very educated about these statistics and was, was attacking these trans women. And she was saying essentially like, don't go round and say, because you've been a woman for a fucking year and a half, they understand the struggle fuck off. Right, right. And because you were just had male privilege two years ago or whatever, and you've had it your whole life. What was that video that um, that God, that Comedians, it's so I ran into him yesterday. Kyle. Don again. Yeah. I ran into, on his twitter page. I raise a thing that he did with, uh, with, no, it was bruce. No, Caitlyn Jenner. Caitlyn Jenner. Fuck. That can change. And I'm coming in here. There's no pc shit allowed in here at all. Um, but uh, this, this is it. Hold on please. Select from the beginning and give me some volume so it will hold up before you play it. Before you play it. No, this is, um, so kyle dunning, how'd he say his name? Donald again. Dot. Kyle done again. Did a face swap with Kim Kardashians and Caitlyn Jenner. And so, uh, take it from the beginning. It's, it's a,

Speaker 7:          01:15:41       hey, how about this women's movement? Ha Hr turn now baby.

Speaker 5:          01:15:48       You lived as a man. Most of you had the bay [inaudible]

Speaker 7:          01:15:52       few sheer ish. Bruce used to make me touch his penis till he climaxed. Yeah, Time's up. Me Too. That was the you though. Oh, nice. Can blame the Becca mentioned. Nice. What's your next question? What was I wearing age? Are you weighing? It's super cat, right Dash Donna Karan. 800 bucks. That's right. Fuck yeah, it was worth it.

Speaker 5:          01:16:18       That's it. But fuck. Where did you find out his whatever. Um, no. His instagram, somebody sent it to me. I think that's his twitter, but somebody sent it to me on his instagram page. He does that. I don't know him, but he does a bunch of these in their fucking hilarious. Yeah. He wrote, he wrote an Amy Schumer's show. It's really funny. Really funny. Hey, do you remember back in the day he, that cow comfort he did that cow commercial back in the day was a chick filet or something where he was like dancing with a cow. Do you know what I'm talking about? We don't have to play that. I come up with Chuck Blakeman. Um, but I just mean like, it was something funny. He's, he's funny. He's a tricep chick filet yesterday. Why do you eat fast food occasionally on Sundays. Chicks please. Fucking delicious. But it's going to be too, but I couldn't go on Sunday. Terrible for you. Five guys. It's by, can't use on Sunday because they are open. Oh baby. Jesus. Chick-Fil-A shit is fucking super religious. I'm going to go have an abortion in the chick filet bathroom. Don't do that. Do you think that would upset any money or we, yeah, I feel like I heard we're not supposed to eat a chick flick into that you can't eat anymore.

Speaker 5:          01:17:22       I was somewhere the other the other day and I was like, oh, let's go to this restaurant. They were like, we can't. That's a Mario Batali restaurant. I was like, I'll buck and can everyone stop raping people so I can eat my favorite pasta problem? Monique telling everybody to boycott netflix crazy hard. I mean, that's insane when we getting a half a million dollars for an hour, but it's like Mo, for most people that's like good at Sane fucking amount. I mean that's an insane amount of money as her comparing herself to Chris Rock's not relatable, she's not as famous. There's a scale and pay disparity stuff is tricky because if you get paid based on the value that you bring, you know else was going on that Kathy Griffin, Kathy Griffin was saying something about Ib. She did 23 standup shows, 23 standing ovations, do a special, she would be willing to do a special bunch, wants to make sure she gets equal pay for equal pay for women and she was making it a part of that like say no and go somewhere else.

Speaker 5:          01:18:18       You know, there's so many outlets now. There's Apps, there's fucking hoot. There's so many places. Just say no. Here's the thing. They pay you what they think. It's worth it based on how popular you are and based on how popular your standup is based on what they think they can get out. Yeah. I mean, that's why Dave Chappelle gets the most, that's why Amy Schumer got a lot. She was selling out arenas. Monique's not doing that. So for her to compare herself to those two people, it's fucking crazy angry and she's basing it on her tickets, like are their box office for movies that she was in like, Whoa, Whoa, whoa. It's like you're not just getting paid that amount. You're getting paid when the special areas that tickets are going to sell because that's special. It's streaming so crazy when they start to boycott, you need to book, we need to boycott.

Speaker 5:          01:19:03       Netflix. Could the head of Netflix who openly lynch someone and not one person would stop watching that? They were in trouble though with the Kevin Spacey thing. They had to do something about that and they did and they did. They lost a lot of money on it. Yeah. They lost 39 million bucks. Yeah. Between that, the Kevin Spacey thing, they rebel. Yeah, I saw them when we were, when we were there. Yeah. Well, that was where Gore vidal used to go to bank dudes. But I feel like that it had to get this bad for people to be like, you know what, we're not going to hire these people because it's going to, it has to be like a bottom line issue. Like I'm not going to hire a rapist because it's too expensive. Have you ever seen the Gore Vidal William F. Buckley documentary? We're a details. No, no.

Speaker 5:          01:19:48       The opposite. They hated each other. William F. Buckley was, he was a British conservative guy who was very popular during the day and this is from the 1960s on television. And they were debating back and forth. Gore Vidal and William F. Buckley, liberal versus conservative, but like on national television. And it was like these really contentious highly charged debates and it kind of sunk William f Buckley's career. Cause at one time Gore Vidal called him a Nazi. You called them a neo Nazi or something. Something along those lines. And then go William F. Buckley said something called him a fucking queer and I'll, I'll punch your face up, a sock you in your nose. And you'll stay plastered, like lost his cool on television called them a queer on television and it was like this whoa moment and William f Buckley's career, you get to see who really is. Yeah. You pressured like I love thinking about what in 30 years or when we look back and be like, Yo, I can't believe we used just fucking say that.

Speaker 5:          01:20:48       You know like retard. We used to just say retard, but only the retards but not just the human who does the word is not the word is retarded means like to slow the growth of something. Retarded ideas, you know like or like like okay, like denying someone birth control. That is retarded. Retarded. It's like socially retarded. Tiding, slowing progress. Yes. I don't think that's a bad word. Yeah. What I think is a bad thing is to mock someone who has a disability, but I don't think that you're always talking about that when you're saying that word. I think we have a real problem with language policing. I think we have a real problem with denying the use of sounds there. So this is what a word supposed to be. It's like you make a noise. So I understand what you're saying. I understand. Like there's, there has to be context.

Speaker 5:          01:21:40       Like I understand I have to, it's supposed to be a sound that you make so I can understand what you're trying to convey and that's retarded. And I go, you mean, you know, that's missing a chromosome, you know, like, it's like, well, that would be me saying that's down syndrome though. Oh, that's true. You know what I'm saying? Yeah. I think it's figuring out what the ideology is. The word I did not know this happened recently. Someone said in a writer's room, um, she's uppity. I did not know that that was a slave term. We all learned very quickly that that was a term, that's what it means. Yes. The ideology of it was to describe a slave that was acting out and we learn, oh wow. I always thought up, but he was someone who is like a high Falutin like, uh, you know, some rich person.

Speaker 5:          01:22:24       I thought it was just someone who is um, or council Trent and would not participate or who is resisting, but it's actually has origins in it. Same with like patty wagon is like offensive to Irish people cause it used to describe drunk Irish people. Irish people don't care. Trust me in one quarter of course it's like non Irish people are the ones who were offended and funny that one quarter Irish, I can't really say I'm Irish, but if I was one quarter black I'd be, you would be forever fucking Afro. I would be a part of the community. And then what's the other one? There was another one under your thumb. If you have someone under your thumb. It's a rolling stones song. But it was, it used to be that was the thickness of a switch that you could hit your wife with. It had to be, it couldn't thicker than your thumb.

Speaker 4:          01:23:06       Yeah. Like there's the, like the, is it ediology or etymology? Etymology of, um, those words, which I just did. No. Um, do you know the term faggot where that came from? Uh, cigarettes? No, that's, oh, that's right. And do you know, why did it turn into gay slur? This is, this will piss me off on Louis ck show. They use this urban myth that what it meant was that a bundle of sticks was a faggot. And so I'm a gay man was a faggot cause they were a bundle of sticks and you would burn them in a fire. That's not true at all. Did he know that? I don't know. It's convenient to ignore. Oh you got to do is research. It's not hard. What a bundle of sticks was referred to was a burden. Some woman they would call a burdensome woman, a faggot because she was like a bundle of sticks.

Speaker 4:          01:23:58       Very difficult to carry around. It'd be awkward. So a man who act like a woman was a fac. Whoa. That's what the term meant. That's where it came from. That's the no idea. That's the absolute origins of that term. So when people say there was a gay guy and Louis ck show that was saying that, and I was, it was him and Nick Depalo and Louie were all playing cards together and someone said some faggot. And you realize why that's so offensive is because, you know, they used to burn people. There's no fucking history of gay people being burned like witches. You, by the way, even the Salem witch trials, they didn't burn witches. They drown them. They drowned them and dogs. This is how fucking insane the hysteria around the dogs. Two dogs in the Salem witch trials, there were dogs were witches live is mass hysteria.

Speaker 4:          01:24:44       Do you know why they think they did that? Why they think what, why? The whole witch trial thing happened. Um, uh, religious fanaticism or got there was a late frost and this has been proven by core samples of the ground. They had a late frost. And when you have a late frost on wheat, one of the things that happens is bacterial growth on the wheat. It re, it essentially, Ergo is very similar to lysergic acid, very similar to lsd and cows were dying and shit. Right? And they thought it was like witchcraft. Well, yeah, there's a little bit of that, but that could have been another symbol. I'll just diseases hepatitis back. But ergo is a psychedelic. And so these people were literally on acid and they were freaking the fuck out thinking they were being heckled by witches and they're paranoid was in their mind.

Speaker 4:          01:25:37       Women, why didn't they think men were being witches as well? I guess a couple of men, men did die but and babies, they kill a couple of babies. She's just cries, lost their fucking minds while they were on acid. But I think, you know, given the situation when men are in a position of power, which they almost always wore back then and then something's happening to them, they would go for the weakest thing, which is probably a woman or a single woman or a woman is weird in any way. And just like that bitch. I mean it's also just

Speaker 2:          01:26:04       that sort of annoying that now people look, this is a witch hunt, this is a witch hunt. Like, without even knowing that that word is actually something to describe when men use to hunt women and now they're using it as a way cause it's like, I mean, you know, men thinking that we're like hunting them or it's some kind of like mccarthy

Speaker 4:          01:26:18       I'm or something. Yeah. We'll witch hunt. The idea is that you're looking for something that's not really their exactly. Yeah, exactly. Yeah. You know, and I guess I just don't know a lot of people who are doing then. Yeah, I think there's a real problem we have, like we said earlier about tribalism, about being on trial, naming. It's a mass shaming. When did you say there's definitely that going on for sure. But I'm saying what I'm saying is that people identifying with all women or men identifying with all men. Yeah. Like especially man, I did it like I had this bit that I was doing for awhile about um, a bumper sticker that I saw in a car. It said girls kick ass. No, it was like, I hate that shit. Some of them, I, some of them are lazy and even, I mean, we're getting into this too. Have you seen the bit, I do point. The point is you can never have that about men. Like a guy have a bumper sticker that said boys kick ass and be like, pull the fuck over. Yeah. What are you doing? Yeah. What's in your car?

Speaker 2:          01:27:11       So yes, I do have a lot of girlfriends who are conflating, you know, empowerment with entitlement. Hmm. I it totally get it. And I have a lot of girlfriends who think they're feminists and they're actually just assholes. Like I have that, I talk about this a little bit. It's real right on stage. If a couple of girlfriends who are like, I need a man of respect me. And in many respect me, I'm like, bitch, you need to get those photos of you and tank tops that say Rosie all day off your fucking instagram before we have this conversation. Or not recognize who you are or, but like I, you know, you then earn my respect. You know, you don't automatically get respect just because you're a woman. That's entitlement. You know, you still have to like watch a fucking Ted talk and read a book every now and then. Like you still have to like be cool and know what you're talking about. So it's like, you know, I, I, there's definitely some duds.

Speaker 4:          01:27:57       Well, there's people that are, you know, they're now on the team that's attacking and there's a tribal like, yeah, this is no different than someone like the Patriots were fucking kicking ass. Yeah, that's, that's tribal too. It's the same thing. It's a natural inclination that people have,

Speaker 2:          01:28:13       but it's also at the same time, like, you know, I think a lot of guys I've heard, we look will, you guys hate all men and you think all men are assholes. It's like, for me it's actually the opposite. I know a lot of really amazing men that have cell phones stolen, rich restraint that I'm comparing the shitheads too. You know, like in your, does

Speaker 4:          01:28:27       it say that though, just or just what? They're scared. They're guilty. They're saying that you hate all men. No, I get the people who are like, you, are you bitter? You know, feminists that hate men, like you can't even say that they're tribal. Yeah. You want to stand up for tribe. Male. Yeah. Instead of just objectively looking at this and well, what's going on? Well, imagine being a woman, man. Imagine being a woman who's been working in an office. Yeah. And dealing with this shit all of your life. Imagine being a woman who's been raped. Imagine being a woman who's been, you know, how to walk down the street past a bunch of guys and they grabbed her ass and harassed or learn about the neurological of that, that

Speaker 3:          01:29:02       go on. I, he likes sometimes we can't speak out. Sometimes we freeze like you said. Um, you know, and I think it's just like nobody wants to look into that research.

Speaker 1:          01:29:09       There are some women, very few, but there are some women that hate men. There are some men, I want to say,

Speaker 3:          01:29:15       so don't pull gender is a trauma response. Yeah. That is a one person hurt me or a couple people hurt me and I need to generalize about all of them to give myself a false sense of safety. I have friends that have been divorced a couple times and those are the trickiest ones. Cause those guys, like they literally like they have this idea that there's like a, that the, the women at the enemy and they take your money and they, they some new pretend they pretend they like you and then eventually they turn it on you and they get their lawyers and they take your money and then I go, what's going on with you that you keep gravitating that woman. Yeah. That's my thing. It's like what's going on with you that you like you had no idea what people are very different in the beginning of your relationship with money is you people have real personal sovereignty in the beginning of a relationship. I like interesting beginning of relationship

Speaker 1:          01:30:00       you lock on like is this going to be the person that makes me feel better about life is just going to be the person that brings me joy and this is going to be the person that brings me lust and sex and fun. And then afterwards you get bored with each other and then people get resentful and Yup. Yup. And this is the thing about men with money. I've always said like when a man with money as dating a woman who doesn't have money, then there's this weird dynamic like the woman like it at first or some guys, let me get it first. Okay. The man, when the man with money is dating the woman that doesn't have any money, the woman is like, Oh wow, this guy's got money. This is amazing. But then when they get married, she's got money to now it's like now you're just another guy. Like I'm a rich lady now. Yeah. Like now I have money, like gone fucking divorces, dude, I'm, I'm bridge.

Speaker 3:          01:30:43       Oh, I see. So, and then there they get entitled the money. I would say I would never take money of the guy of dating.

Speaker 1:          01:30:49       Well you had married. That's different. Yeah, you're not, I mean, but that dynamic of the guy having all the money and the woman being like a waitress or something like that. But that's a normal dynamic. Yeah. When it happens, like men like it because like look at me, you know, I have, I'm so advanced in comparison to what she had financially, right where she is. I have all these things that I can offer her that she could never get on her own. We've got to fly to Paris on a private jet. I'm going to blow your mind, you know, that kind of Shit, right? Yeah. And then the woman marries his fucking ass hole and then next thing you know she is rich too. She's got Gucci bags and a big diamond and she's driving a Ferrari and she's like, you know what, I don't want to suck this guy's Dick Anymore. I'm tired. I'm tired of it. I'm tired of the whole thing. And then, you know, she's not impressed anymore because she's wealthy too. So she's not a wealthy guy anymore. He's just a guy cause she's, well

Speaker 3:          01:31:39       I see it there now equals and then he doesn't have something that I can't access on my own. I don't need him anymore. I don't, I've never, I don't, I've not had money before and um, I've been hungry and poor before. I guess I get that, but I don't know. Maybe it's just maybe things are gonna change in terms of like maybe we'll look back and 40 years and be like, remember when 40 olds you just used date broke 20

Speaker 4:          01:32:00       year olds. Like, I mean it's still going to have to fight. We're biologically wired. You guys are biologically wired to want to, you know, fuck women that are fertile. I totally get that. It might be a liability wired to want to fuck successful or men that are, that have their shit together. They're more emotionally stable. They're physically more together. Yeah. Are You my dad? Are You my dad? I've done it. But this is not even just a dad thing. It's just a, a position of power like this. Someone is like, they've accomplished something. Maybe that's looking to be the new Darwinism is this is like, I don't need to date a man who has power. I don't really need protection. Right. Cause we have alarm systems and I have a lock on my door and whatever, but we're still wired to seek men that are Alphas and then have power and that have resources even though, you know, we're not, I don't think that's going to go anytime soon unless we go full socialist.

Speaker 4:          01:32:49       Like we're not as vulnerable as we were 2000 years ago. And you know, yeah. Well we're definitely, I'm sure 2000 years ago, men and women and had a much more different dynamic than they have in 2018 yeah, it's getting better. I think overall we have less violence. We have less crime. We have less, almost everything today than we did 2000 years ago. And I think in, but I think the amount of radical change it's happening, like we were talking about before, between 1960 and today, if we go another 50 years in the future, it's gonna be even more insane. But it just might be like, like the got the people that thrive are the ones that are able to have some self control over their primordial brain. So it's like you, it's like I want a Ferrari. Like I would love to, but it just doesn't make sense.

Speaker 4:          01:33:31       You don't want to suck that Donald Sterling Guy's Dick. Do you know what I mean? Totally. It, it seem worth it. I love to eat pizza every night, but I'll fucking die. That's not hell. I'll get fat. You know, you'll, we'll just start to understand the consequences of dating the person that we are sort of primally attracted to and just go like, I know what that is. That's what I want, but I can't have everything I want because I'm a fucking human adult. I think there's also a real, the way human beings react and the way we even think and the way what we think is acceptable and isn't acceptable, changes with the culture. And I think like, it's one of the problems with going back to like 1960 and being upset at some of the way people behaved because it's like, man, that is the way people behaved back then.

Speaker 4:          01:34:12       We, we know better now, but to get mad and a man who uh, behaved a certain way, nothing. I'm not talking about like drugging and raping and stuff like that, but certain, uh, 20 years ago when it classic acceptable sexist behavior from 1960, that was just normal. Yeah. Like I think this is just a part of the culture and people thought that's how you behaved. Now people are shifting and I think we're, and also I think one of the things that's going on in this is one of the things that's empowered the women's movement in the powered a lot of other movements is access to information. It's radical. It's happening so fast and it's, it's inundating us and we have to catch up to it. It's like it's happening so goddamn quickly that we, we're just trying, okay, what does, okay now? What's not okay now what can we do? What can we not do? And access to each other. Like never before have 10

Speaker 3:          01:34:58       women all assaulted by the same man, been able to meet each other. Well, how else would we run into the grocery store? Hey, were you assaulted by that guy by any chance? Like we were able to find each other online. Jamie, where are you talking about Steve Corral and the office? Was it you that was talking about that? What about you watched the old episodes of the office, which is not that long ago. He was such a creep. You can't really do that. But he was kind of like bumbling, you know, like what was the difference? I think the percepta sewed where a girl shows up to sell purses and he's just like, makes a big to do. Just like you can have the conference room and guess what? I just got this espresso maker. Don't make me give it to you cause I won't. Oh, do you need a ride home? I'll give you a ride home. But didn't feel creepy or did the ride home thing was a very particular creepy thing based today's world. Right. And I think what I know about the English version, I don't know what the intention was for the American version. The idea was to make him kind of polarizing and it makes you uncomfortable. And He, it's crazy that it wasn't that long ago.

Speaker 3:          01:36:07       Tangible. It's hard to explain. And I think this is why a lot of guys were getting annoyed because when you get granular about it, it makes us seem like we're just being crazy. You Hug me at the comedy store and it feels different than when, let's call him Joe. Blow hugs me. There's just something creepy about Joe blow and there's something not creepy about you and I can't explain it and I can't tell you why. And I sound crazy and manic and history doesn't sound because that's the same way with gay guys. There's certain gay guys and hugged me where it's creepy. There's certain gay guys that hug me, hug me. I'm like, what's up? Get my hug. And it's all just warm and friendly and it's cool. It doesn't matter if the game, but then there's other guys that they hang onto me a little or they'll squeeze my back a little and it just gets a little, little extra.

Speaker 3:          01:36:55       Females are kind of trying to, the more granular stuff. I know it sounds like I'm being crazy, but I promise proof. And I don't know, but the crazier I sound, but it's just making me thirsty. It's like a hug that lasts a little too long. I had a guy office from a bad date. It seems like you both eight eight each other out and went down on each other. It sounds like it sucked, but then you're anonymous and then you're, you're 22 or 23 like this is like poor judgment does a lot of cruelty involved too. Like somebody described it as revenge porn for women. Yeah. Look, this is not, these are not comparable crimes and I, I can't speak to saying who's guilty and all that sort of, I don't know what happened information, but I

Speaker 2:          01:37:56       don't think that that this person is coming forward equating it to rape. I think women know that there's different echelons. There's rape, sexual assault, assault. I mean, look, I don't know enough about it and none of us were there. But like I do know in my twenties I'm not saying as he's as guilty, again, I don't know. But in my twenties I had a lot of sex that I felt I was coerced into that was transactional sex that I didn't want to have. You know, and this is something we talk about in the female brain movie, is that men are less able to read cues or emotional cues on, on faces than women are so apparent. So we have evolved to cry four times more easily because men have a harder time reading, um, emotional cues on faces. That's why women crying until we crazier because men are designed to sort of like see movement and to hunt and to, right.

Speaker 2:          01:38:43       You're not designed to sort of read like, oh, is she frustrated or angry? You know, like, have you ever been on a double date with your wife? And like, um, you think that hit her and the other, I can't imagine you on a double date. That was so weird thinking about it. I've done those things really in the very early stage. But have you ever like, yeah. And you go on a double date and like you have to fucking talk to the guy and he's asking you a million questions about hunting and you're like, just listen to my podcast. Why do I have to fucking do this for free? And then your wife is talking to the other girl and you think it's going well and the girl gets the car and you're like, oh my well, and you're like, she was such a bitch, I couldn't fucking stand her.

Speaker 2:          01:39:16       And you're like, it seems like you guys got along great, you know, like, has that ever happened to you? Okay. She's just had it. She just talks like if she, if she thought something was bad, she would let everybody know like right away while she would just, it'd be obvious or just, just sort of like, sometimes there's like, um, basically, and we talk about the movie, it's like, it's just men are not as good at reading emotions on faces. So it's like, if you were to say like, Whitney, how are you? And I was like, I'm fine. You might just be like, okay, she's fine. Let's move on. A lot of guys can't understand that there's a discrepancy between what I'm saying and how I'm saying it. And it's like about just reading, like how muscles move on on human faces. So it's like you can look up, um, sort of the difference and you know, so I'm not defending men in that area.

Speaker 2:          01:40:01       I think that that an interesting conversation that might come up at some point as people who have autism are really going to be fucked in all of this. People who can't pick up on social cues because so much of this is nonverbal. I fear that we're going to get to a place where we're going to have to like sign contracts and ship before we have sex and stuff. Because I, you know, I, I know that in my twenties and I'm freezing up just talking about it, is that when men made physical man says to me, I would be giving off these nonverbal cues. Um, and I wasn't saying no, but my body was saying no. And I'm not saying it's necessarily a guy is supposed to like be able to read my body language, but that's what was happening cause I froze up because of my trauma response and I was scared.

Speaker 2:          01:40:38       And also we are conditioned to be submissive to men. Um, I am conditioned to feel shame if I don't fuck a guy in a certain amount of time, I spent totally the opposite. I thought you would feel shame if you fucked a guy too quick about a guy on the first day and you feel shame. But if you, there's this sort of like unspoken rule that you like kind of have to fuck a guy on the third day. Wow. Yeah. Oh totally am. I do not think that Jamie's never heard of. So yeah, I feel like guilt and shame and I'm difficult and I'm a prude and I'm like, would I ever, yeah, this might just be me, but like every, I mean every girl that I know that I'm, maybe it's just my generation or something and guy out there like, oh, I gotta do is just get three dates in and we're in.

Speaker 2:          01:41:17       But think about all, think about negotiate. So just the, just the tip is like something we joke about, right? But it is based in the idea of negotiating for sex. So if someone is starting to say, just the tip, that means I've already said no, and you're like, well come on. How about just a blowjob? And then I'm like, no, just come on. Just the tip. It's like we joke about it but that means it in negotiation is going on. And then I've already said no, and then you just get worn down. And that's like transactional sex, which I think women are kind of just, I won't generalize about all women. Um, but I think some women are like sort of like, I don't want to have that kind of transactional sex anymore. And like, like I feel like I'm being used as a blow up doll.

Speaker 2:          01:41:52       And I think from what I understand, that girl fell as, she felt like she was like rush through dinner and like went back and was just sort of expected to be fucked. And I think a lot of what's happening is that men were promised something from porn and women were promised something from romantic comedies. Men were promised that women like won it all the time and women had been promised that men like want to talk to us. And I think these expectations are clashing. So I think it's a little bit of nature and a little bit of nurture.

Speaker 4:          01:42:18       So a lot of it being media misrepresentations of actual relationships and that's the models that people are acting on

Speaker 2:          01:42:26       maybe. Yeah, I think it's different for every person because every person has a different experience with sex. Everyone has a different ability to read faces, everyone has a different nature and nurture. Everyone had different fucking parenting

Speaker 4:          01:42:37       problem with like sometimes you really shouldn't be with that person and you're there and you're there and what do you do? What do you do? I mean I do,

Speaker 2:          01:42:45       I literally had sex before just to like get out of there. You're just like, Oh God, I don't want to argue with this person right now. But I feel like this first one feels entitled to my body and I feel shame and I'm embarrassed and like it's just all this stuff that's really kind of hard to explain and I think it probably is annoying to the guy and I just like, I don't want to be difficult and I've been so gas lit to believe that I'm difficult. It just gets like really messy and then by the time you figure it out you've already had sex and you're just like, okay

Speaker 4:          01:43:10       fuck, can I have my parking pass back? This isn't, this is part of just being a human and trying to navigate your way through the fucking treacherous waters of just social interactions, sexual interactions.

Speaker 2:          01:43:22       I didn't figure it out until I was 32 years old. I wasn't able to like articulate or figure out whether I actually want to be having sex or not. So like my advice to all my guy friends is do not have sex with girls and under 30 cause like I could not, I didn't have the ability to even know or say what I wanted until I was

Speaker 4:          01:43:37       for men. A lot of men feel like if you have sex with a girl who's under 30 then it's fun and you can have fun. But if you have sex with a girl who's over 30 their biological clock is ticking and the present time, I should sound nice pressuring you into this, you know, relationship very quickly. What's your intentions? Where's this going? I want to know what we, how we stand, what are we yet

Speaker 2:          01:44:00       block or find another one. There's tinder. You can find plenty of women in their thirties what have you like are you just want to calm down and you swear like a one. Let's work this out. I mean look, we're going to have to like start talking to each other I guess and like setting expectations. I know that sounds like a nightmare. It doesn't, it so much drama. Oh BC. But it's also, it's like so funny. This is totally like I, I'm probably shouldn't say this, but I was thinking someone was like, yeah. And then they had dinner and afterwards they s whatever and she wasn't into it. I was like, that is already fishing. I never want to have sex after dinner. I think it's disgusting. I'm like full of Lasagna. Like I don't want anything in my body after I've eaten. Like I need a couple, I like to have sex before I eat.

Speaker 2:          01:44:43       So He's going down. You have to Fart. Can we, if we're going to, if I'm just assume that not any sex after dinner it's not consensual. Super Normal. Yeah. I grossed out by, Oh look, if I just like eat chicken farmers, like I don't want your, you know, stick together. You know, so I, I just know that I've had a lot of sex in my twenties that I didn't want to be having that felt transactional, that just didn't feel, you know, I think that, you know, who really wins and all those prostitutes and sex robots. I think

Speaker 4:          01:45:16       prostitution was legal. See the problem we even would, prostitution being legals is still shameful. It's still looked down upon. Whereas massage keep your job, you get to keep,

Speaker 2:          01:45:26       what did you get to keep your job? I just say no. I mean like if you're afraid of sexually assaulting someone by accident or having an inter personal relationship at work and all this stuff that's going on, just like having sex with a hooker, like you're not gonna get fired, they're not going to work

Speaker 4:          01:45:40       port you. Yes. But it's very problematic in that it establishes this dynamic between a man and a woman where it's very transactional. Yeah. And uh, yeah. And then if you get accustom to transactional sex, it could make it worse when you're actually what it's like then your thought is just I just got to pay for it. Why? Why would I deal with your bullshit? I'll just be a grownup baby. I decided to get my dick sucked all

Speaker 2:          01:46:03       I just mean if like men need, cause I literally was thinking about the other day, I was like I would like someone to invent like a virtual reality game so that women can understand what sex feels like from like, it must be so amazing. I was thinking about it

Speaker 4:          01:46:16       more amazing for guy than is for a woman gets, I'm like to be willing to like throw away your career and take that big of a risk. That's not what it is. No it's this what the way I described it in one of my specials, I said being a man is like having a small 24 hours sperm factory with a very shitty agreement with the union. You got one delivery truck that's your Dick. Yup. And you've got one warehouse and packages are piling up every day

Speaker 2:          01:46:45       and you dig. It's like these fucking packages

Speaker 1:          01:46:51       and the more it stacks up, the more desperate you get, the more you're willing to negotiate. And then we do stupid things. The nature of being a human being is men are trying to get rid of calm cause we're making it all day long. All Day long we're making Kom were come factories. That's what we are. And, and when, when a man doesn't have sex for a few days, you don't like I went through a, I did an experiment on my website like a few, many years back where I didn't jerk off for a month. What happened? It was like, Holy Shit, you get so desperate. Like just touching people. Just getting a hug. Your Dick gets hard. He's like, this is bizarre. Like, cause most of the time guys handle it by just jerking off you just like, it's like a relief. You just, you're, you literally a backed up. I have pressure and you relieve it.

Speaker 1:          01:47:33       I don't know what it's like to be a woman, but one thing I do know is you're not making a thing that you have to get rid of you. Like we have the end. The difference between a guy being horny on like day one of no jerking off versus day 30 you're a totally different human being. You're a desperate, you know, and men who have had, don't ever get touched and don't ever get to have sex are extremely desperate. And then we'll do almost anything that we'll negotiate in very bizarre ways in order to be involved in relationships. That's why you see men that are quote, pussy whipped, like why are they pussy whipped and what is that? Well that's the only option they have. These are weak people and the only option they have is to acquiesce to whatever desires and needs the woman has.

Speaker 1:          01:48:16       You have to submit, you have to submit, and then she'll throw some pussy at you like a dog. It's some fucking scratch your way. That's literally what happened. And just thought of airborne posts. Teddy has all these men had no lack of putsy in their lives. These which men? Powerful men that are going down, but this is whenever they want it. Right. But there's still, there's well Harvey Weinstein thing I read, it wasn't fucking, I don't think he was a fucking addict and I think he's a power addict, sex addict and he's a fat fuck. So he's a food addict. Everything addict and power, they baby it just stuffing things in his body. I mean he's a fucking thing though. Power and fame addict. Then I'll tell you a story about bill cosby. I used to a, I did this casino once and I talked to this woman who was the one of the managers that casino.

Speaker 1:          01:49:15       She said bill cosby would make the entire staff watch him eat curry before he would perform. They would have to watch him eat. It would come into his dressing room and he wouldn't talk to them. He would watch him eat and that's what he would do when he wanted, when he was eating his food before us performance, everyone had to watch him. Then he had someone, a security guard, tuck him into bed at night. They had a tuck him in, so he laid in bed and they would talk him in and then shut the lights off and closed the door like he mental illnesses. That delusions of grand jury, a separation

Speaker 5:          01:49:48       from normal society. This thought that he is royalty, right? This is what I think. I think the same behavior that kings have. You see that with dictators. You see that with celebrities that are, especially celebrities that again became super famous 50 60 years ago, like bill cosby. You know, he was famous 60 years ago. Some people like Danny Masterson who is young, this guy's not, you know, the Danny masterson one is interesting because he's a scientology scientology. I mean, now I think he's left. I don't know if they could embrace, well this is Paul Haggis too. This is one of the things that um, they were saying about him because they think that he's being set up. I understand by right. So, yeah, I know Leah Remini I heard her saying that. She was saying these are fake. I don't know if that's true. Danny masterson didn't leave like, I don't think it was employee.

Speaker 5:          01:50:38       I've been hearing this for years. The fuck didn't you cool? Hey, tell everybody this is my phone as a phone. Still look like that. No, if this is true, but I'm going to tell you because I don't want to, you feel bad about it. 10 years from now I know. Totally. Like, you know, like I had heard creepy shit about him, but it's like why didn't the young guy like that? Who can fuck anyone whenever he wants? I have to do something like that. And it's like, I understand if you have all this, the packages and the sperm building up, but why can't you just jerk off? Why can't you just fuck someone consensually? That's a different thing though. The rape things at different things. The rape thing is dehumanizing power things. It's like you, you, you say no fuck. You don't say no to me, I'm going to fucking do this to you and you, there's a that's not sex.

Speaker 5:          01:51:20       There's something way more. Because if you can get hard when a woman is crying and wants you to stop and saying, please stop, don't rape me. You know, I don't want you to do this to me and you, you could still do that. That's like some Viking Shit. Really some because it's like, I mean there could be some sort of, obviously not to defend it, but some sort of survival instinct in being able to procreate with a women who's not interested. Like our biology has still not checked for like overpopulation and the fact that we no longer need to force ourselves upon women to proliferate the species. There's gotta be some leftover ancient, horrible rape DNA. Cause there were a lot of people that were, I mean Genghis Khan, his genes or in some ungodly. Yeah, pull this money. Oh Shit. Sorry. I keep telling that neck again.

Speaker 5:          01:52:14       I can see, I mean it's interesting like I'm just so curious how things are going to evolve. Like are the people that are going to proliferate the ones that have the most self control whereas it used to be your, your masculinity or your value is defined by how strong you are. But how powerful and maybe the new power is self control and restraint. Well I think maybe people need to start looking at each other as other human beings instead of us versus them. And I think that's part of the woman's movement. That's mission and part of the men's side of it. That's an issue I think we have to get past. Yeah, I think

Speaker 1:          01:52:46       you know, I'm Dan Harris from good morning America was on the podcast the other day and we were talking about in terms of politics, he was saying toxic tribalism. I love that term because that, that, that is, that is across the board an issue in this country, right versus left. Yeah. That's an issue in this country with basically everything. Men versus women. I think we have to just look at each other as human beings and uh, you know, I'm not, I'm not pro men. I'm not pro woman either. I'm pro human and there's a lot of really shitty men out there and there's a lot of really shitty women. Correct. And it's, it's a real problem if we lump everybody into, well, women want this and women or not women are not going to do that. Women are not going to lie about rape. Women are not going to lie. Of course, they are just like, men are going to lie about it because people are liars. Great. There's a lot of people that are just poorly formed human beings and they are now a part of a righteous tribe of people that are attacking this other tribe.

Speaker 2:          01:53:41       And it's like most people, most women didn't March. You know what I mean? Right, right. Hey, thanks. In, they did 50 million women were marching. Most women did not give a fuck. I mean, but the numbers are pretty staggering. Staggering. But there is something interesting I think about what happens when a group of women get together. Um, cause I think that has, at least in my experience, especially like in the workplace and I, and I was like trying to do some research on this. Um, and I don't know enough about it, but there's this thing called, I believe it's called favoritism bias and it's how women in a workplace actually compete with each other because they're afraid that the man is going to think that they're favoring their gender. So they're actually shitty. It's like Queen Bee Syndrome or something where it's actually, I've experienced a lot of competition with other women because there was so much scarcity for jobs.

Speaker 2:          01:54:28       It's like women just getting in the workforce like in the last 10, 20 years, this is kind of new. So it's sort of like, bitch, this is bucking my job. Oh Hell No. So I think for women actually be on the same team, not to support toxic tribalism is actually kind of a refreshing thing to just be like, like, we're not competing for a man. We're not competing for a job. We're actually going to unite. Like, I think there's just some people, there's something that kind of healing about that. At least for now. Yeah, I agree with

Speaker 1:          01:54:52       dot. I've, I've experienced women confiding in me about other women in comedy and there are so shitty and judgmental and critical. Yeah. Like I've had women say things about other women comedians. I'm like, what, wait a minute. You, you really think she's like that? Yeah. Like, yeah. Oh, she's a fucking hatch. She's fucking terrible. And this now I'm like, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute. She is funny. Like, what are you talking about? No, no. They'll get really angry about it and like, like what is it like what is that like? What is that?

Speaker 2:          01:55:21       I you complex. Like there's, there can only be one woman each show and it's fucking her or me. Or it's like, you know, and that's like a primal thing of course. Cause it's like I want protection from the man cause of whatever. There's all that sort of like old primordial shed. But competition between women like I have, this is the first time I'm kind of not feeling that and it's kind of Nice for the moment. Um, and we'll see. Cause I, I definitely know even though I think that, you know, women are, my concern, I don't remember who I was talking about this the other day is that basically people are just going to stop hiring women or stop hiring mixed, like putting, mixing people gender is up in offices because it's just too scary. I'm concerned and I'm concerned there's going to be a little bit of a backlash that guys are smoking dope. It's not worth hiring a woman because it's just going to be a nightmare. I mean, I know a lot of guys who are like, I'm not, I never hire pretty assistance or I'll never hire a pretty girl to be in my office because I'm just too scared the way men are gonna Act, which I think is a little crazy and unfortunate, but it's like, but it's true. No one wants to get sued.

Speaker 4:          01:56:18       Well it's not just, no one wants to get sued. You change the office dynamic. If you have a really hot assistant and she's walking around with all these other guys in the office and the other guys in the office like getting their cups of coffee, Matt, Sarah, her assistant and his men recognize that like when I see a god it's like skis it on a check and like Ah,

Speaker 2:          01:56:37       well if you have need an intern or something and you have two women that are equally qualified and one is overweight and 55 and one is 22 and gorgeous. I don't know how that can be equally qualified but whatever. Like who are you going higher or you kind of like, Oh, this is a liability. Those could be a problem.

Speaker 4:          01:56:53       Well, the 55 year old lady might be fucking crazy and the know how to use dropbox. She might be like really interested in, you know, some of the things that we're interested in. Make it easier to talk to her. Or it could be the opposite of the 55 year old might be wise and you know, very calm to be around it and you can't like that's a good the individual.

Speaker 2:          01:57:14       I just need to mirror visual. Oh my corporation or if your NBC or if you're Disney or something. I know there are a lot of conversation. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          01:57:20       Oh, like potential liability. If someone has a 55 year old intern, it's like, well don't you need money? Well that's a red flag in your money. Yeah, that's right. I'm just, I'm just a PA on the show that I was on wants news 39 and I was like, wait a minute, why are you, you're a PA and you're 39 and he turned out to be out fucking nuts. And he was on pills. Oh No. He was on. He was like, I'm like, do I had to tell people I go, do you see the way he's moving? Like he turns really quickly. I go, that guy's on speed. There's 100% and then you go, they were like, you sure I go watch him. I go watch him. He's, he's twitchy, swiveling around. He's always talking. He can never shut the fuck up. He interrupts conversations and he injects with these long, boring stories of his own guys on speed. 100% 39 year old intern. They fired him. They want to firing him like right after this one job that we did. But that was like, okay.

Speaker 2:          01:58:08       It was tricky though. I've just, I've talked to a bunch of people who are like bosses and they're like, fine, I'll just stop hiring women. Oh, that's crazy. And it's like, Oh God, that's cool. Other kids, they're just so afraid of getting sued and they're so afraid of interoffice relationships and that sort of shift. So it's good backfire.

Speaker 4:          01:58:21       I am too free. I'm to free to have input on this. It's, uh, it's, you know, I think there's a weird dynamic when men and women work together and you have a really hilarious bit about it. Like people working in an office together like that, they, the way they interact with each other, it's very strange. Like honey badgers in a fucking cage, which is weird. Yeah. It's like your, this is your new family. You're with

Speaker 3:          01:58:41       these people eight hours a day and the, you're only asleep for five and then you get, you know what I'm saying? How long do you see your wife every day? No. Two hours. Maybe. It's fucking weird. Then you're in traffic for three, right? So like what, what are you doing? Like your life is these people and so then your sexual situation gets weird because helping bonds with them, trauma bonds, especially people

Speaker 1:          01:59:05       that never fuck, but they want to fuck forever and they just hug each other a little and they're sweet to each other for it, but nothing ever comes of it. But they both know, they both know they really want to fuck, but they're not going to. So they kind of a little flirty and a little affectionately. Yeah, and they exchange the silly text messages and then the wife will find out this is an inappropriate emotional relationship. And you're like, well what does that mean,

Speaker 3:          01:59:28       friends? Yeah, my work husband type thing. I've had that sort of step off of that. People do have, I've had for people to openly talk about their work husband, I was like, Whoa, this is dark. I mean I remember with Chris Taleah I was doing a show that Chris, Leah and we would spend all day together every day and we were like having this relationship. I mean we're also acting his girlfriend and boyfriend and we were sort of super bonded. And then because you spend all day talking to each other, confiding in each other, sharing all these experiences, by the time you get home, do your actual boyfriend and you're like, can I? And then you and then a month later I'm like, because remember when that director yelled at me and they're like, no. And it's like, I thought I told you, you don't listen to me. You don't understand me. It's only because I've invested everything and that other person that all of a sudden it starts driving a wedge between you and your actual, so what you're supposed to do in relationships is keep everything and hold it. It's like not ejaculating basically emotionally. It's like hold, like if something crazy happens to me at work, I don't confide in someone at work. I have to wait till I get home and bore the shit out of my boyfriend.

Speaker 1:          02:00:26       I know this dude who is a very funny guy and he brings this woman on the road with them and when he brings this woman on the road with him, his wife freaks. She does like it. Yeah. He's got a woman opening act and his wife is fucking freaking.

Speaker 3:          02:00:41       Do you truly think I'm all for female opening acts? Obviously panicking. Um, do you think he has any interest in it? No, he just wants to, I mean, I support having a, she's nice. She's funny. She's a good comic. And he has her open forum. Yeah, I used to open for, yeah, I mean it's totally possible. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          02:01:03       But, uh, you know, it's that thing, you know, you're, you're experiencing this thing that she can,

Speaker 3:          02:01:08       no, she's, the wife is not a comedian. That's another thing. I think comics also have a bond that I feel like the outside person can never totally understand as well.

Speaker 1:          02:01:18       Way We joke around with each other. Like if just the things you and I have said to each other. Yeah. If we said these things in an office,

Speaker 3:          02:01:24       Holy Shit, human resources, it would both go to jail. Yeah. I think you'd go to jail more than me. I am the worst. But thank God that NBC lost it. Those friends writers made a lot of progress for us. Okay. So there's this famous lawsuit on friends. The writer's assistant sued

Speaker 2:          02:01:40       the writers in the writer's room because they were saying something about the actresses are sang like fucking them with twigs or I think something crazy. And um, they sued, uh, the writer's assistant sued the writers for sexual harassment and said I to hear all this disgusting Shit and the writers one, because they said it was part of our creative process.

Speaker 5:          02:01:59       But it is, it certainly is. And especially with Comedians, we have said ridiculous shit to each other. Yeah. I mean like, well we just like guys, first of all, I callan Adelia mean that we will said ridiculous shit. Yes. Like about each other off like like a lot. How loud? Fuck you do the weird fuck you bro. First of all, I'm a top me, I'm a top. You're just going to give in. You're just going to give in, you know, spinning your hand, rub it on your butt and we will do that to each other because it's how we make each other laugh that we need something really extreme in completely forbidden to make each other laugh. That's correct. I think that is so fascinating. I think Comedians, we just have to go off the grid a little bit every now and then. Just too much porn. Right? Which is we need gags and fucking Mascara running and fucking belt around your neck. We need the whole thing. We need gagging to record the conversation.

Speaker 2:          02:02:51       We have a certain threshold of adrenaline we need or something. Yeah. When I get around calm it take, it took

Speaker 5:          02:02:56       all long to delineate the difference between like how to act around comics and how to act around human beings. And I also think like part of the reason I'm a little manic when I first see a comic, it's like a puppy seeing its own or I'm just like, I know you just get so excited that I get to be like, ah, bitch gon fuck. Like I get to be. Um, yeah. When you get to be free and I feel like I spent all day just be more, don't say that. Don't say that. Don't say it. Yeah. What's our, our culture, the culture of, of comedy, standup comedy. It's very unusual. Yeah. There's the community. It's one of the reasons why I'm very protective of that community and it's one of the things that I've thought was the, you know, one of the things I've said about this whole Louis C k thing, I'm like, he did it to one of us.

Speaker 5:          02:03:36       You did it to us. It wasn't him. Not that he should do it to anybody that doesn't want to be a jerk off in front of them. Yup. But it's, I don't think fighters are interns on our writing staff are the same as standard too, right? Yeah. It's like standups is one thing kind of thing. You just had a thing you'd like to beat off, pick on someone your own size. You know what I mean? Come shirt off in front of me. You know what I mean? Now as a 35 year goal, I would love to see that. And apparently he did do that to some comedians and they laughed and he thought it was funny. Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker 5:          02:04:08       Well there's some women that he did that too. It didn't come out and they thought it was funny, but there's a difference between Lake, oh my God, what are you doing? And like, stop please. And I could lose my job if I challenge you, you know? Right. There'll be, nobody is doing that now. Right. No one's beaten up. Put them anybody anymore. I think that's over most likely. You still, there's still people scared to talk. Right. I guess I just am curious what the, what the neurology is of being, being able to get an erection when a girl is going stop. The worst is if he didn't

Speaker 3:          02:04:38       get an erection. It's like three quarters hard. Like that's your thing. If a woman goes like being humiliated as an aphrodisiac or shame, I think it's driven by shame. Yeah. There's a lot of weird shit to that for sure. I don't know. I don't know where to go. Like I was reading this thing about pedophiles and like I'm not supportive of pedophiles, but like if you are a pedophile and you have horrible thoughts, there's nowhere where you can go unless you can afford therapy where you can say, hey, I have some really fucked up thoughts and I want to fuck a kid. And because shame is the engine a pedophilia and you have nowhere to go. Or if you dukes go somewhere, people are going to go, Ooh, you're disgusting. And they have nowhere to quell that shame and stop the cycle. Right. And then if you act on it, then you have more shame and then it just makes it worse.

Speaker 3:          02:05:22       And most pedophiles were molested, right? So it's this just this fucked up cycle and there's no social acceptable place to go express that. The wave in Aa you can go, Hey I want a drink or I want to do drugs or whatever. There's no like place for them to go. Yeah. And it's also because it's your, your thing is victimizing children, right? Like the zero tolerance for that anywhere. And people want to kill you. They literally think you should be killed, but there shouldn't be a place like aa or somewhere where you go to go. Like how would we know if it even works? That's the problem. I know what works. Bullets smell what's in your head, what's in your head work. Correct. Someone's a kid. Fuck. How do you feel about the fact that if you are a pedophile that means someone molested you and you weren't. You were a victim at some point as victims become perpetrator. So it's like how do you break that cycle without just constantly shaming people cause then you shame them into isolation and isolation is where shame thrives. Maybe one day we'll have some sort of a form of therapy that can literally erase inclinations and that can erase surgery. That fucking takes out. Oh that's what they were trying to do right when they were like, yeah, great, bring those back.

Speaker 3:          02:06:31       Like what ever you have to do with a drill and fucking, but it's like, cause when you see, I mean I was reading about the dark web is the deep web or the dark dark. I'm a hundred years old, but like 90% of it is child pornography and you're just like, there's so many. Like what the fuck it makes me homicidal hero cop. This guy was like a hero cop got his arm blown off and it was like being, and then they just caught them child porn like Oh fuck no fucking vegas shooter apparently had a bunch of child porn. Not surprised. Yeah. You know, so it's like, but like to stop that cycle is just so it's like the same idea of like jerking off on someone and being turned on by them being scared, being sexually aroused by a woman, being scared. There's something fucking going on there. And I dunno if its nature, if it's nurture or if it's fucking viking shit. The pedophile thing is also, it's such a forbidden topic that no one even wants to express any sort of sympathy for those people at all. You don't want to be thought of as a pedophilia sympathizer. Correct? Correct. It's almost like a thing that you can't fix. Like they're the,

Speaker 4:          02:07:35       the recidivism rate is so high. If there's a way to, if it's an adult technically and addiction, I mean I think it's probably a mental illness or if some sort of trauma therapy because those people are traumatized. Right? So if you're addicted to cigarettes, yeah. And uh, you go through therapy and you kick them and then you get back on the cigarettes 10 years later, I don't care. But if you're addicted to fucking kids and then you live and then another kid gets fucked because you couldn't keep it together anymore. Yeah, I'm not, I'm not willing to take that risk and that's, that becomes a real problem. Especially someone who has young children. That freaks me the fuck out. And I like most fathers who are hearing my voice thinking about this right now, I want to murder. Yeah, I just want to take that person out of the food chain.

Speaker 4:          02:08:19       And that's, you don't want to take that risk. And I guess the one thing I would say is like, people you know have a lot of sympathy for children who are molested or victims of pedophiles until they grow up. You know, like a lot of women who are victims of that ended up manifesting as the women who can say no or the women who are like, you know, traumatized and, and freeze up and stuff like that. But those women hypersexual that's the other thing. Torn stars. A lot of women that get involved in the adult industry were molested as children. Like a giant percentage. What I say is all of them. I don't want to say it's all of them cause I know there's a lot of women that do it just because they enjoy it and that's totally cool. But there were a lot, there was, there was some survey they did once, what? Back in the day. And it was some alarming number.

Speaker 4:          02:09:05       Right. A lot of people can never come to the, to come to terms with that. I was talking to a therapist who was saying something about, um, plastics. A lot of people that get crazy plastic surgery do it because they were molested and they're trying to change their face. So when they look in the mirror, it's not the person that got molested. What they thought about Michael Jackson and really? Yeah. That was one of the big theories about Michael Jackson is his father abused him. Yeah. You know my theory about Michael Jackson telling me, don't say it again, tell me everything. I think he's a Castrato. I think he had his balls removed. I think that's why his voice was so high. That was a common thing that used to do with singers. Really? Yeah. You ever heard of [inaudible] music, but is she going to teach Whitney Cummings? They used to do that with opera singers more than I do.

Speaker 4:          02:09:50       You know a lot of shit. No, I'm not to eat cookies while we're doing it. There's no sugar in those. I'm so hungry. Yeah. There's very little, those are no cookies. They have very little sugar. The glycaemic index on those as extremely low, get hungry. I don't understand it cause my body burns fat. I eat very little carbohydrates. Like this morning I ate eggs and a fat beef. So you never have life sugar spike or sugar dips because you don't eat. You have any spikes? No, I'm eating fat most of the time. I mean he fat in meat. That's what I eat. Mostly. God, I need to just regroup here. I need to start from it's way healthier. It's way better cognitively. This is what I don't get mentally this way. I take four naps a day. I don't think any now. It was always so fucking tire.

Speaker 4:          02:10:38       Well I'm on Beta blockers to, I think that's a whole other thing. But you're on Beta blockers, Beta blockers, Beta blockers. I get really bad migraines and it's hormonal. But I think I figured that out. Uh, I lead a blockers are supposed to keep you from getting nervous. Yeah. It stops like adrenaline, I think from what I've understand, I know a lot of archers use that test for it because when you're on the like an archery competitions and the nerves will make you shaky. So I produced a lot of adrenaline and cortisol at the tiniest things cause I'm a fucking trauma surgeon. Every damn hug. Women don't want to hug you. I'm a fucking bad. And so I was getting really bad migraines because of my neuro chemical spikes. I would get too much adrenaline and too much cortisol when I get nervous. So I take two Beta blockers a day.

Speaker 4:          02:11:25       I'm a catch Jesus. You had your balls cut off today would be your place, the way you're developing. They do it to a boy when they're very young. There's actually recordings of cast Trados from like the early 19 hundreds see if you can get that. What surgeon does? Jamie got us pulled off youtube before. Oh, did it? I'll pull it from there. So, oh wait, because it's like um, child porn. No, no, no. Because it's a, because the recording, it gets flagged by Youtube as being their proprietary or their property, their property. And so anything that you use that someone else's stuff can get you pulled off of youtube. You know like there's a shit load of people out there that have like these nature videos. There's a big one we get, it gives us pulled all the time. Yeah. People that own things for it. Like the way you would license something, you would, you could do something like that or you could give them your ad revenue, but you'd have to give them like all the ad revenue from a show. Yeah, it's insane. So like if we played a clip from the office and we played it and you could see it on the show, we would totally get flagged and pull them. And if it happens more than one time, you can lose your whole channel.

Speaker 4:          02:12:34       You could argue it that it's fair use, but you don't have a license to do it. And if you're making money off of it, it might not be considered fair use. So listen to this sound with this sound is that we're hearing, and Jamie, what is the name of this? This is a young man who had his balls removed and one of the things that happens to them as they get older, they, they never really develop masculine traits. This guy got fat because he had no testosterone, no testosterone is no balls and so they have this haunting high pitched, almost female but not quite sound. And it was a preferred sound. So much so that they would take children and sell them off and they would get their balls cut off at a young age. So they would develop to be cussed. Strados can't handle things.

Speaker 4:          02:13:23       Yeah. This is my thought about Michael Jackson. I think Michael Jackson's voice was so high. It was so high pitched and like falsetto was so pure. I really, I mean no one's going to know. I mean there's no way to know, but I'm a retard and I have my own thoughts. These are, these are my thoughts. The surgeon who did that surgery after he dies, why aren't I coming forward and getting $5 million for this story? Because that surgeon's going to go to fucking jail. You do that shit in America for saint to took a kid, cut his balls off. You can't do that. It might not even be real. I might just be a stupid person. It was a dumb idea, which is more likely. No, I think it's a pretty good explanation. I mean weird, right? Children. They didn't sound anything like that. You hear Jermaine Jackson saying he sounds like a man. Michael Jackson never sounded like come down. Yeah. It was all weird. Fishy. The well, it's also the abuse that he suffered as a child and his incredible connection to children. This bizarre connections you get stunted. Yeah. What? Jamie?

Speaker 8:          02:14:23       The doctor that killed him or was in jail for killing them wrote in a book that his parents had him chemically castrated.

Speaker 4:          02:14:31       Oh, like taking those real,

Speaker 8:          02:14:33       sorry. I mean that's what he wrote in a book. I'm reading on some New Zealand new sub. I don't know how

Speaker 4:          02:14:37       I could they do that. They done that to trauma. Lester's they've do. They do that to trauma loss is to giving them the option. Oh, so that you don't know Michael Jackson chemically castrated by parents claims. Dr t this is my fucking theory. Damn, and I'm writing. I Bet I'm right. I Bet I'm right. Well, the also his children were in his children, right? He's a heterosexual man, but heinous things happen to Michael in his lifetime that actually changed or had him morph into who he thought he was. One of those things, according to Murray, was his parents are arranging for his chemical castration. His testes were never remove, but injections were given to Michael Jackson to maintain. His voice is high pitched voice of a child that went long beyond puberty. He places much of the blame for Jackson's extrordinary but difficult life at the feet of his family. I fucking knew it, so let me ask you. It was right. That stops testosterone production like what's given to kids on are transitioning and that sort of thing. You're done. That's why he was so skinny. He never, when he was a child, they did that to him as a child. Teen boys can you still go? You still grow. Women are tall. You're tall. You're taller than me.

Speaker 8:          02:15:41       Lot of Gmos.

Speaker 4:          02:15:43       That's why. No, it's just a different genes that didn't, it doesn't stop you from growing tall stops your muscles from developing. Oh, but and, and then what does that have to do with the vocal cords? Cause something about your vocal cords. Testosterone changes your voice. That's why when a woman turns into a transgender man, their voice becomes a different food. Is that legal? No, it's all legal. Chemically castrate though. It's fucking crazy because that's the, that we talked about this in Roseanne. It's doctors, right? If that doctor's right. And I bet he is right. If you wrote about this. I bet he's right. He self published it too. Just what does that mean? No one's giving them bucktail cause the fuck's gonna give it a factual book deal to the guy who killed Michael Jackson idea. Hello. No, they didn't. They took it away. Oh did they get there and he lost it.

Speaker 4:          02:16:27       He lost his book deal. When the thing came out about a Hetero, him thinking that it's okay for young boys to have sex with gay men. Not Great, not great, not a great brand. Community has a different take on that. Yeah, they have a different take on it. Then the straight community, the idea of gay, young gay boys having sex with gay men, it doesn't bother them in the same way with a lot. I'm not, obviously I'm not speaking for the community and I don't want to generalize, but the reactions that I've had from gay friends that talk about it say it's way more common. Huh? Well that was the Bryan singer thing that Brian Senior had those parties at his house. We had a whole pool full of fucking gay kid

Speaker 3:          02:17:02       and Morrissey also demanded Kevin Spacey about it and I'm like, it's a difference. Yeah, exactly. Like how like how do you know if you're 17 and like we were just talking about the power dynamic. How do you even know you're trying to figure out who you are. You're looking for a father figure or you abused yourself. It's like we just, we don't know until they grow up and figure it out in therapy. If it was really conceptual. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          02:17:22       I mean it's weird that we put this arbitrary date to like 18 arbitrary, right? Well you can go to war now you're 18 like what? I figured out it's 32 who I was when, when she should be allowed to vote. I say 50. I say

Speaker 3:          02:17:38       didn't really, um, yeah, I mean it's so it's like, I mean, you know, should you be allowed to drive? I drove like a maniac when I was young. I just never should have had a car until I was like 23 years old. When should you be able to drink? When should you be to at all, if at all? Yeah, it's a good question. It's terrifying. And once you be able to have kids, that's a good question too because you only do it for a certain amount of time and by the time you can't do it anymore, that's when you finally know what you're doing. I feel like I'm 35 years old. I finally am qualified to be a mother and this is when you stopped being physically capable than nuts. Do you have a couple more years? We can still shoot one out. I have, I have my shits on ice, so I think I might have, I might have more time, but you have to find someone that you would really raise a kid with.

Speaker 3:          02:18:21       Very different. I have to find the perfect nanny. No, I have a guy that I think is a plus and if he's not, I'll just give the child to you. You seem to maybe doing a pretty good job. Raise them, raise them in the forest. I mean, and then you said it's just like it. That's a very real fear. I'm finally for the first time like, Oh God, I have to get my shit together on that, but then I get super scared about this world. I'm like, do I want to bring kids into this world today with all the books and medicine and shit? People were shitting kitchen floors. That's why we're here to have water in 20 years. Yeah, we'll have water. Yeah, we're going to figure this out. Can you be drinking salt water,

Speaker 4:          02:19:00       panicking, freaking out. But that's also why we correct things. I think the technology ingenuity and I also think is ironically as it seems, a guy like Donald Trump as president is going to really activate people. They're going to start moving in liquid at this fucking women's March. Big Part of that is having to grab the pussy president had to get this bad in order for us to wake the fuck up because we were all zombies. Sleep walkers. He's the reason why those pussy hats

Speaker 3:          02:19:28       that by the way, whoever's making a wind fall off those goddamn puts me out. They should be thanking Dora people down there. Sally knows how to make pussy hats like me. What if he is behind the selling of that? Yeah, no, it was amazing to see all the commercialization of it and everybody capital I know

Speaker 1:          02:19:43       going to make us much more appreciative of the environmental protection agency and then the, the, all the restrictions at Obama put an offshore drilling if anything goes wrong. Yeah. Cause he's just opened up offshore drilling everywhere. You know that, right? Yeah. Do you know what he's done and what he's done? I've heard that he's done a lot of really crazy things with the environment and with state, with um, you know, uh, whether it's bureau of land management areas or um, uh, W W I don't know which, which organization. There's definitely state land that was public land that's now being diminished to state parks. They're now being diminished and they're opening them up from mining. They're opening them up for extraction of minerals and resources. Yeah. And all this is close to rivers and watersheds and all these different areas that are very important for different ECOSYS tines.

Speaker 1:          02:20:34       Terrifying, terrifying stuff. In terms of the future, Delaware, well, there's earthquakes in Oklahoma all the time now that never used to happen. And all that's directly attributed to fracking. They're drilling these giant holes in the ground and pumping all this water in there and fluids and all this shit they used for fracking. It's, it's, it's going to energize people and get people to understand that the, there's real consequences to just thinking about money and yeah. Also how ridiculous it is that a guy who has more money than he could ever fucking possibly spend is only thinking about money in his thigh is in his mind, he's thinking about America. He's thinking about people prospering and getting jobs and this not, but clearly it's not just that, it's clear it clearly there's some personal profit that's being extracted from all this. And of course, yeah.

Speaker 3:          02:21:20       Well, yeah, it's like his people, it, his hiring, you know, and look, and I love Oprah. She's a delight. But for the left to go like, let's have old purvi president and bcs twitter page. This is our president and Kendra letter. No, our president. No, no, no oprah. Let's hire another celebrity who isn't qualified to be the breath. Wasn't it oprah? I just wasn't telling anybody. Do you guys remember the secret? Remember the fucking secrets? Yeah, go back. And when oprah was telling everybody you could have anything you want, you just kind of imagine it like, well, like fuck, are we watching? He's just, it's not great to also be like, hey, let's have this other celebrity be president. Wonderful Lady in her fault. I don't have anything

Speaker 1:          02:22:00       problem with Oprah, but I just think what we should have is someone who is extremely educated, who is incredibly nuanced and well thought out opinions and things and someone who's got a really good grasp of what it takes to run it. Yeah,

Speaker 3:          02:22:15       let's stop electing rich celebrities to run our country. Tried it didn't work. It didn't work out so well. Well you know, or an oil

Speaker 1:          02:22:23       man. Yeah, maybe it worked out if in the mining industry

Speaker 5:          02:22:26       and then it's like just tricky. It's like the idea of being like, I don't think oprah should be our next president is like, well you're sexist. It's like Jesus fucking Christ. You're racist. No I'm not. It's like we should be able to say we don't think certain people are qualified. Stop yelling at me. Do you read your comments on instagram? Should I just stop and you never do so smart. Rarely. Very rarely. Sometimes they'll look in and I'll see someone that's a dick and I'll just block them. That's like what? Cause I tried to like engage and like try to like see what's going on but the kind of shit or just too insane, it's not worth that. You just put out good things. Try to be nice. And is that a crazy person or is that a person that masquerades as being sane and then behind closed doors?

Speaker 5:          02:23:02       It's crazy. It could be both. A mix of both. Could be both. Um, did you ever hear about that guy that got fired from reddit and he was saying awful shit on reddit and posting all these terrible things and they found out his personal identity and they uh, went after him and then got him fired from his job and it devastated his life. I think I was married with kids and it takes life completely fell apart. Yeah. People enjoy being a con anonymously. They enjoy it. One of the things that I found on instagram, if someone says something really particularly heinous, you'd go to, their pays are almost always private. They're almost always have like a blocked page because they're cowards. There's just a lot of like very deeply unhappy people that will lash out at anybody that's in the public spotlight like you. Especially a woman.

Speaker 5:          02:23:43       Crazy question. If a man this happened to someone I know, if a man is engaging with relationships with other women on the Internet as a character, is it cheating? No, it's just he's picked, he's having a character's. Yeah. Well who is he an artist is you're right or no, no. Didn't have, you know, just sort of pretty adrenaline free job. Yeah. He's probably fucking completely bored out of his mind and it gives them a chart. Is it like a video game? Cause I was like, this feels kind of like a video game in a little, in a little bit of a way. It is. It's role playing. You know, it's like a simulation. Right? And a little bit way it's just being deceptive. Right? Maybe it's fantasy wishes he was someone different. Yeah. Like is that if your wife has online as a different person aging with men and the pictures of her own pussy, that's when it gets weird dicey. Right. Pussy flying through the air.

Speaker 5:          02:24:44       Literally, you know who's here. This is what's going to win flashlights. I wonder if the same of flashlights, it's going to go on robots. That's what's going to win sex. Robots. Robots. Totally. They're closing in to your point about the right, do you think that that also works a muscle of to humanizing, yes. Yeah, and also changes your reward system. Like instead of like learning to be an interesting charismatic person who's caring and kind and reaping the rewards of real relationships with people that care about you and you care about them and understanding real true love instead of that you're fucking this robot I not like, is it cheating? If he fucks a robot, like I can't have that fight. I can't, can't do it. Did you fuck

Speaker 3:          02:25:23       the robot or not? I can't have that fight. I can't do this. What do you know? Did He fucked the rob telling me the truth? Look me in the eye and tell them you didn't fuck Siri. I can't. Is a robot bad but a fleshlight okay. Yeah, cause there's no head. If there's eyeballs, it gets very dicey. Fake robot. The robot is just skin here. Is She prettier than me? I just want to make sure the robots have wrinkles. A couple of crow's feet. Yes. I don't want them being to it. We got to make sure these robots, Ooh, we got it. They giggle. They laugh at your badge. You have to make sure these robots aren't too pretty. They gotta be ugly. It's not going to happen. I'm going to be hot as fuck. They're going to be perfect. I don't like this one bit.

Speaker 3:          02:26:10       You posted that thing of that robot jumping schedule. Many of them carry. Was she that episode of Black Mirror though? One metal head. The new ones I haven't seen. The new one. New Season of black mirror is amazing. Insane and one of the episodes has a row, a bunch of robots that are going after people and it's called metal head. I don't want to say anymore. It's terrifying because very realistic and t incredibly realistic and probably represents something that's going to exist in the future. Or maybe it's going with the other way. I'm to be like, baby, can you just fuck the robot tonight? Maybe I'm tired. That's when you know it's over eight, two months. Send them over to the robot that was on your side. Please don't, don't impel Milo's maybe. Maybe you'll allow him to fuck a robot, but the robot has to look exactly like you have a spare. We'd get the robot. We'd order it. It would come in and be like, is that what I look like?

Speaker 3:          02:27:06       And you'd put your hand up and just like a mirror. It would put its hand up and you'd both like move perfectly in sync. It was up to age with me though. It would have to age. It would have to get older. When I get older to have to get wrinkles and gray hairs and shit. Trying to through the dirt look worse. They're all Asian. Did you see the Woman Grace Woo at the barn? Hello? Hello? Is that a dick? I've never seen. No, I didn't see a woman at the march. What actress named Grace Woo who talked about sort of the Fed, the Fetis fetishization of Asian women. Get over a pitch. She's bragging. That's what she's doing. She's bragging. Everybody just had to fuck. I'm so tired. That's my thing of fucking free the nipple. I'm like, only girls with great tits won a free the net ball.

Speaker 3:          02:27:56       Now you're just, you're just bragging. Yeah. No, no. Women in their forties or like, let's free the nipple. It's all like hot checks, you know, see what they're doing. Yeah. I don't want to free the nipple when he comes this, wrap this up. Once you move you out. February 9th, the female brain. It's about all of this shit. Yeah. It's about all of this sort of stuff. Where would it be? A, it's going to be in movie theaters and then it's going to be on Vod. It's like, uh, got Blake Griffin will Sasso is in it. Yeah. Neal Brennan is hilarious. Hilarious. He's slick. Steals here. He has a scene with Blake Griffin where he plays his physical therapist and it's fucking hysterical. I could not cut it. Um, it's really great. What the Cummings Ladies and gentlemen, give her a big hug. Oh God.
