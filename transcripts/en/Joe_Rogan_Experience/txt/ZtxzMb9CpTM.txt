Speaker 1:          00:00:00       Alright. Oh wait, where are we going live?

Speaker 1:          00:00:10       Boom. Mic live. Mr Carroll. How are you sir? I'm very good feedback. Very good to have you back. So, uh, you have a podcast now? I do. I've joined the ranks. You've inspired me. Well, you know, it's important. We need people like you out there. You are, you have like, what, seven episodes so far? Seven episodes up a few more in the can. I'm going to try to dribble mail once a week, uh, for the first six months or so. See how it goes. Are you enjoying the process? I am mindscape by the way, is the name for those out there in podcast land? Yeah, I'm loving it. You know, the, the real, the thing that tilted me over toward doing it because like, look, it's, I have a day job, right? I can't spend too much time doing this stuff. Um, but what I realized it was an excuse, a licensed to talk to people who are not just physicists, right?

Speaker 1:          00:00:51       Because like I had the intellectual interests that go way beyond just what I do for a living. And in academia, you're not allowed to take seriously anything other than your discipline, your job, right? I'm allowed to be talking about physics, but nothing else. But so now I can talk to historians and economists and philosophers and psychologists and it's great. Well, you could've just gone to evergreen state and then you could talk about anything. Teaching a professor. You could just, if you're a professor, you could teach them dance. We have to break it out of the system. We have to do it ourselves. Yeah, man. Got To break out of that system. So your podcast, you decided that this would be a great venue for you to just to expand on subjects and just get into anything that you'd like. Well, you know, I, I have opinions about things and I've never been one who said you shouldn't talk about things unless you're a phd.

Speaker 1:          00:01:39       Credentialed expert, right? I think everyone should be talking about everything, but you should know what your level of expertise is. So if you're not an expert and you should listen to people and they should then make your own decisions. But you should first gathered the information and so I don't feel quite like I can go, I have a blog and write whatever I want on my blog, but I can't really expound on my theories of economics because what do I know about economics, but I can call up but very expert economist and chat with them when the podcast and both I will learn something and hopefully the listeners as well. So you're going to just basically talk about anything. The shtick is we sort of tried to pick an idea, right? So for the hour or whatever it is, I don't have your statement. I can't do the two and a half hour thing.

Speaker 1:          00:02:23       I know I need more. I need more nitrogen caffeine in me. But uh, yeah, for an hour, hour and a half, uh, I'll get someone who's an expert and we'll dig into an idea and try to understand what's going on, you know, in, in sort of everyday people's language and how it fits into the bigger picture and things like that. And uh, trying to mix up, you know, good old professors, which are my peer group to sort of, I got some people coming out of left field. I had a professional poker player, I have a movie director coming up, a chef and things like that. So, but basically, yeah, whatever I want to talk about. That's awesome. So is this for your own edification or are you just using it as just a platform? Like what? Yeah, I think that my, like philosophically I treat it like it's for me, right?

Speaker 1:          00:03:08       Like I'm not going to do guests or topics or not do topics because the people say so. Right, right. There's plenty of people out there who don't want me to talk about anything other than physics or at least nothing that involves politics or religion. Stay in your lane, Bro. Very much. Right. But I love talking about politics and religion. So guess what, I'm going to talk about those things. Um, and so, and then hopefully it finds an audience, right. And uh, so I'm willing to listen to suggestions, but mostly I have to treat it like it's for me. Well, I think it's absurd to ask someone to not talk about things if people love doing it. Like I especially love, you know, the commenters saying, Oh, you know, of course he's a scientist so he knows nothing about politics. I'm like, you're an anonymous youtube commentor.

Speaker 1:          00:03:54       Why should I listen to your opinions about politics? You definitely can't listen to the opinions of anybody that's willing to take the time to comment on Youtube. What? That's a problem with that whole bit about it because I was like, what kind of a person does that? Like who, who listens to a video and goes wall time that are put her in March. He takes it very rare breed. Unless they have like a real specific expertise in what's being discussed. Like maybe it's about auto repair and like that is not how you replace a transmission. Here's why. Or if you just ask him questions like I love my calendar's like mostly the comments even on my youtube, like so I send the video, I don't do video, right? I'm just doing audio podcasts. But you can put them on youtube with the static image and for some reason people like that.

Speaker 1:          00:04:40       People listen to podcasts on Youtube, right? Yeah. And uh, the comments have actually overall been surprisingly good because youtube is one of the worst, right? And overall, but you know, people say like, oh, I didn't know that or tell me more about this or this was interesting. That's great. By all means do it. But if you're like, don't talk about that, I want to hear about this, then you know, block, go away. It only takes a tiny drop of Lsd to pollute a whole bucket of water. There you can really, what the deal is with youtube comments, it's just the sheer number of people there. The problem is that youtube has a dedicated group of shitheads and trolls for whatever reason. I don't know why would that platform seems to track some of the worst in people that comment and I'm, you know, I cannot claim that I'm immune to a reading it and getting annoyed.

Speaker 1:          00:05:35       I'm like, you idiot, I know. I should just say forget it. Move on with my life. And I'm like, dammit, well it's, it's interesting in a lot of ways. I mean there's something fascinating about this new form of communication where someone can send this a very just flat text, you don't know anything about the background of the person who's sending it and there's a style of doing that that's designed to kind of mess with your head just to poke out your nerves. Right? And I look, let's let, let me just, you know, just to redress the balance here. Um, it's great that we have these new ways of talking to each other. Right? And part of glancingly mentioned the fact that academia wants you to stay in your lane very, very much. And I think that that's a shame. And so I think that part of the many hidden purposes of my podcast, one of them is to dissolve the boundary between science and the rest of our intellectual life.

Speaker 1:          00:06:34       Right? Like, I'm not going to. Sometimes they'll be talking about science, sometimes I won't. Like we, we tend to silo off science as a thing. And then like economy, economics and history and political science is another thing that is out there and relevant to the world and science is something that is sort of a form of entertainment for a lot of people and I want to mix it all up by the different people talking to each other. And so overall by all means comment on the youtube videos and you'll keep that conversation going. That's good of you. That's, that's, that's a very healthy attitude and that's kind of the attitude that you have to have if you're putting everything out there. Yeah. And just one more irony is like, I'm not a, I don't seek conflict. I'm a conflict averse person. Like I just want, I don't want to argue with people, but I do want to say things that are true and not everyone agrees about what is true.

Speaker 1:          00:07:18       So there's going to be arguments. So I put up with that, but I'm not seeking it out. So I would like this utopia of rational discourse where everyone is talking about ideas in a dispassionate way and in good faith looking toward moving toward the truth. It would be nice if we had like a system, like almost like a rating system for humans, like a yelp for commentators that people are trying, that it's not a bad idea. It really isn't. In terms of like, like people review your comments on things and enough people decide like this is just unnecessary yelp for expertise or for commentary and generally all the above. Yeah, I mean I think uh, we're probably going to move to some sort of a system like that. In fact, some people are actually advocating that for society to have some sort of a like a rating system for people and almost a new kind of currency, like a social currency.

Speaker 1:          00:08:18       They're doing it in China. Right? You've heard this scary for people though because it's China and China is a, it's a trippy place and it's very trippy in terms of. It's sort of got capitalism going, but it's also a communist dictatorship and this is big for the government in the. All the companies are also in, you know, the thing with Huawei. Am I saying it right? People are getting mad at me about that. Huawei, I think it's Walway, it's the now that number two cell phone manufacturer in the world and they're for bidden to work with us carriers. The United States does not trust this company. So they've said, you know, this company is apparently done some shading things according to them, not according to certain tech people say it's nonsense, but there so that another, keeping them from selling their cell phones with 18 t and t mobile, whatever.

Speaker 1:          00:09:12       Uh, but they're the number two manufacturer in the world now that just surpassed apple because China is just. Okay. Yeah, China's a trip. Yeah. Well it's, it's, they know very well. It's kind of remarkable to me that China has been so stable and successful because there are, you know, people who don't like it. There are people who rebel against the system, but they've been. So the government's been so enormously successful in controlling inflammation. Yeah, totally. What you learn, like you can't Google Tiananmen Square if you're trying to a, you can't get those images or anything like that. And companies want to do business there so they'll go along with it. And I'm not sure if it's stable building. Anyhow, I talked about this when I last podcast with the ultra monk. I'm not sure that democracy is stable either, so, um, when, when the technological capabilities are changing so rapidly, a huge abuses and huge changes are on the horizon.

Speaker 1:          00:10:02       Even we don't know what they're going to be. I mean, that's, that's my worry about the social credit system, right? Like, it's. So obviously abusable make the wrong people have bad credit and make the people you like. I mean, if this is run by the government, you're going to trust them to, uh, do it fairly. I, you know, I'm a little skeptical about that. Well, I think this last election and the subsequent analysis of the manipulation of the election has been very eyeopening to people. And, um, the, the Russian troll farms, have you been paying attention to that stuff? That is, that is a stunning revelation that there's 24 slash seven businesses where people are set up where they're hired to just tweet and post things and comment on things. And they're all working in some way to try to manipulate the way people look at the news.

Speaker 1:          00:10:58       Yeah, and the most interesting thing to me, I thought like if they were clever, they will do this and they do it. It's not just that they have a policy that they want to push, right? Or candidate they want to push, they want to foment disagreement. They will take the most radical views on either side and pump them up just so Americans are tearing at each other's throats. And yeah, that kind of works. Right? That's, that's pretty successful so far. There was a radiolab podcast where these people that were trump supporters detailed being contacted by these Russian troll farms where they organize these rallies and they organize these protests and they even hired a fake hillary. They fought, they hired a fake trump and they're gonna have the Hillary and a cage and they wanted everybody to yell out, lock her up and this, these Russians coordinated this whole thing. Right. And then once it starts, know, organically

Speaker 2:          00:11:54       takes over. Right? I mean, you, you probably saw just the other day this a trump rally where the CNN reporter was trying to do a seminar. I'm trying to do a camera spot and he just like got drowned out by people shouting at him and you know, shouting obscenities and I, I don't know what, that, that's bad. Right? Okay. I mean, it's bad. The media. I wouldn't want that to happen to Fox News. I wouldn't want that to happen to people that disagree with you. GotTa let the people in the media, but media, they're not the enemy of the people and what he's done is very dangerous. You know, it's, it's very, it's very sneaky and very dangerous and it's very manipulative and he's essentially, he's in survival mode and when people are in survival mode, they, he's not thinking at all about the importance of the press.

Speaker 2:          00:12:39       He's thinking about his, his situation, his stance, his position in life. Preserve that. And what's the best way to preserve that when someone's attacking me, attack the people who are attacking me. Any. Yeah. You build yourself up by creating an enemy that everyone can agree on right? One of the chilling things that you pointed out, there's really, despite the rhetoric, there's never been a successful, truly multiethnic democracy in the history of the world, like democracies that have worked, have worked because one group is the boss, right? And you know, they give rights to the rest of the people and so forth and try to be fair to some extent, but that's changing, like as the demographics of the world are changing, uh, we're, we're becoming more of the patchwork that we claimed to be years ago and people aren't quite happy with that. They're not comfortable with it.

Speaker 2:          00:13:28       And this is something that can be used to gin up emotional reactions. Yeah. There's people are terrified of change too. So is this nostalgia for the past? Yeah. And you know, the past that is not necessarily accurate that they, that they, that they envision. Um, and, and it's, and I'm sympathetic with the real problems, right? They're real problems with inequality and with healthcare and with jobs and you know, not just the number of jobs, but the jobs are changing. Not everyone is really tooled up to be a high tech, a office worker in this day and age and so I take those concerns really, really seriously, but those concerns being channeled and very unproductive ways to scapegoat people who don't deserve it. One of the things,

Speaker 3:          00:14:10       it's fascinating to me, this seems to be boiling under the surface is the possibility that we might need some sort of universal basic income to deal with what's happening with ai and automate automate station like auto automation of m cars, automation of normal jobs that put food preparation and things that people have come to. Just take for granted that a human's going to be doing that. It's entirely possible that millions and millions and millions of people are going to be out of work within a very short period of time and it seems to me that it's just. It's one of those sneaky things that might just catch us before we're ready for it.

Speaker 2:          00:14:48       Yeah. I think that if you extrapolate very far

Speaker 1:          00:14:52       ahead into the future and imagining what utopia is supposed to look like or you know the far technologically advanced civilization, why wouldn't we imagined that work is done by robots and machines and human beings are free to be creative or artistic or athletic or just sit on their butts if that's what they want to do. If you believe that that's a possible future than the way to get there is to, as robots and machines do more and more, make it more and more possible for people to live without working. I think that's a is at least I have no idea whether it works in practice. I'm not an economist. I haven't studied it, but I think it should be taken seriously as an idea. If you looked at it as a pessimist and if you looked at it with a cynical perspective, you'd say, well, people just want.

Speaker 1:          00:15:33       They don't have motivation. Then they behave like rich kids or entitled people or people who won the lottery. They blow all the money. They don't take it seriously because they didn't earn it. It goes against human nature. Yep. I get that. And maybe it does let them do it. Who, who am I to tell people that they need to be virtuous by earning a living in some job they may or may not be able to keep for very long. The people who say that usually haven't gotten fired from their jobs raise. Right? Right, right. Yeah. And I always feel like the people that are actually ambitious but the real problem, and I think we'd be growing up with that, I think if you, you've got it as an adult, you'd probably recognize it as a safety net. It is. But as if it was during your developmental process, you might rely on it as a constant.

Speaker 1:          00:16:19       Yeah. And so that might be a problem in terms of motivation. I think so, and I think that, uh, and you see it, right? I mean, I, I, I have friends at various levels of income and class that they grew up in and you can always tell people who grew up in very comfortable, uh, environments because they don't have jobs, they have projects. I'm working on a project because they're not really worried about the project failing. You know, like if you grew up without that safety net, you're more cautious. Like you have to have a fail safe, you have to have a backup plan and. But what if everyone had that backup plan? What if we could all do projects instead of work? Is that really a worse world? I didn't know any trust fund people. Oh yeah, yeah. The ones that I know all blow their money.

Speaker 1:          00:17:01       Actually I know some, I know some very wealthy people who raise their kids really well and you trust fund people. Oh yeah. As people who like never need to work a day in their lives and they all work really hard. That's so weird. It's possible. Find those people and clone them. Yeah. Find out what made them tick, what was there. So they found a passion. They found something that they're actually, that seems to be a giant issue. That's right. And your parents need to sort of encouraged that, you know, um, you know, parents matter when it comes to like, if you're, if you are very wealthy, do you feel like you deserve it or do you feel like, oh, I should give something back because I'm really, really fortunate. Well, there's cockamamie ideas that come from people that haven't earned their money to, like one guy came to him with this crazy idea for this project he's doing and wanting me to get involved in it.

Speaker 1:          00:17:46       And I was, I was going over the details of it. I was like, I don't think this is going to work. Like why? Why is this guy so enthusiastic about it? And then the more I dug into it, I'm like, oh, he got all this money from his dad. Oh, well you go, this guy is just, he just, he's got pipe dreams. Yeah, I mean, I guess I feel just to be honest about it, like I'm very lucky, uh, not because I grew up wealthy because I didn't. But because I now have a job that represents what I want to do, like what I would do with my life if I were independently wealthy. Isn't that different from what I'm doing right now? Right. That's exactly. But therefore I kind of think that I would like a world where everyone can do that. If that's what they wanted, that would be amazing.

Speaker 1:          00:18:28       Yeah. The real question is, does everybody have an actual interest? And if they don't, is it nurture or nature? And if they don't, do we force them to. Is that we want to do something you love, find something you love. The thing I, you know, I'm actually, I never tell people like, follow your passion or plain what do you love? Because look, there's a lot of people who need to earn a living, right? He's loving people who just need to do work because they need to pay the bills. That's fine. That should be respected. That in the we have right now, that's an an honorable thing to do and not everyone gets to just do what they love. That's true. There are some things though that you can do for a living. They you'll actually enjoy, like you need to make a living, but because of your temperament, because your interests, you can find a thing, whether it's carpentry or whatever it is that you find to be fascinating and fulfilling when you're actually doing.

Speaker 1:          00:19:22       You're making a living, but you're also doing something that, man, I. This is very satisfying. Maybe, maybe that's true. I mean, it's certainly true. It can be done. Can it be done for everyone in the world? I don't know. That's a good question. I don't know. Well, there's so many styles of living too. You know, when you're talking about China. Uh, I was in China recently. We spent some time in Thailand and we flew through China. And one of the things you realized about China is that just a totally different way of moving. Like people just walk right through people. Yeah. I mean they, their lines, if there's a space and align the peanut, they don't respect that space. They go right into that space right in front of you. Like, oh, there's a space there. They didn't even think of it as rude. It's not just the style, right?

Speaker 1:          00:20:05       Yeah. It's just this week we went through Southeast Asia for a few weeks and you know, visited Vietnam and Thailand and they're right next to each other, but just the behavior and the city's utterly different. Like just walking down the street. It's just a different culture. I haven't been to Vietnam. What was that like? Vietnam was my favorite. It was, yeah. Everybody says that. It's great. I mean, I don't know. I was there for a few days. Right. I'm sure that there's depths to the country that I didn't perceive. But uh, you know, it was coming to life literally the week we were, there was the first. Mcdonald's was opening in Vietnam, so, which is not good, but at least it meant it was. We were there in a pre Mcdonald's society. Right. And the, it was physically very beautiful. The food was amazing. It was all scattered, shot, like the people just go crazy on the streets in any direction they want and it was not organized or anything like that, but it was very genuine, you know, it was.

Speaker 1:          00:20:52       People were trying to be nice, people seem to be very friendly like that. We didn't speak any other language or anything like that. And uh, it was just a wonderful experience overall. Yeah. That's awesome. Yeah. A Asia is a trip. It's a really different part of the world. China is, yeah. I've been trying to, to, and it's, it's a, that's a trip for a different reason. Right. And uh, you know, I, it, I'm scared by China in the sense that I, I'm worried that they will succeed while still being repressive dictatorship. Right. Like, uh, I remember reading these memoirs from Bertrand Russell when he visited China and uh, he was rhapsodizing about this is an amazing culture, amazing people. This is great. And I'm like, does he not know it's a communist dictatorship? And then my brain kicked in. I'm like, oh no, it was 1912.

Speaker 1:          00:21:37       It was not a communist dictatorship at the time. And that there's a great tragedy in the way that China has been sort of repressed for so long. I think there's immense potential and promise there, but it's also the possibility that they just remain in this autocracy forever and some people's lives improve and a lot of people just drudgery for billions of people. Yeah. It's totally possible. It's, it's fascinating that they become this combination of things. Yeah. A combination of both capitalism and communism. Yeah. Well I think that's it. Like they found a release valve, like he couldn't, you couldn't be. The Soviet Union was going to collapse because it was, it's a terrible system, right. Then, you know, economically, politically, whatever. And China found this little bit of balance where they still have the repressive dictatorship, but they give enough freedom for people to be ambitious and try to get ahead and that improves the economy and they make some terrible mistakes.

Speaker 1:          00:22:28       Right. They're these huge cities that are built. No one lives there. And there's these spooky pictures. Right. So you've seen the recreations of other large cities like Paris. I've seen that. And sometimes like cities like Shenzhen, like right next to Hong Kong, it's a city of 5 million people. Thirty years ago it was 50,000 people, right? Like it just, they built it in a couple of years and, and other places like, oh, we'll build a shopping mall here where there's nothing. It's just instantly, it's, it looks like Detroit the next day. There's no one there knew. No one makes a, no one builds anything. No one does anything with it because it's not really capitalism. It's still a planned economy. And there's pluses and minuses with that. No doubt. One of the big fears about China is there experimentation with genetics is a, they're willing to do things ethically that scientists in America and a lot of parts of the western world are not willing to engage in yet. Yeah. Including the use of Crispr on human embryos. Yep. And I think, uh, so I have mixed feelings about that. I think it's going to happen in our culture. I think we're going to do it right. I actually had. I'm sorry I haven't released that podcast yet, but stay tuned. I have an excellent podcast coming with Carl Zimmer, who was a science writer, just wrote a long book about heredity and genetics and uh, yeah, so what they're going to be doing a with the designer

Speaker 2:          00:23:45       babies. It's not science fiction as far as I can tell it's going to happen and uh, but it's very unclear what it will mean because we're not any good right now. And figuring out how genetics turns, how your DNA turns into a person, right? Yeah. It might be like, you know, that we find something other that if you increase, if you change this particular gene, uh, sure you can live twice as long, but also you'll have Parkinson's disease when you're fortunate, right? Like we don't know what the interdependencies are and stuff like that. Uh, so, but, but it's coming. I think that the idea that we will be choosing embryos to come to term and be people on the basis of their jeans before they're, you know, a implanted in the uterus is, is 100 percent that's going to happen. And the chance that we're gonna be editing them is 99 point nine, nine percent chance.

Speaker 2:          00:24:35       And you're right, China is way more willing to do that. And again, I'm not really sure if that's good or bad, you know, I think it's going to come here. What I'm more worried about is that, you know, people figure out a system that will make a, you can have a baby who's guaranteed to be, you know, tall and beautiful and smart and live for a hundred 50 years and it'll cost you a million dollars, then that'll be a little bit unfair. Right. That'll be an issue that will come up. Yeah. But then isn't it unfair that the rock is the rock? How did he get to be the rock? It is, but I think just psychologically it's a. I think he worked hard, but he also had his giant started. Yeah, he started in the right place. You know the story of Almay, right? No. Good.

Speaker 2:          00:25:20       So yeah, being the basketball player from China, he was basically the result of a breeding program really. Like they encouraged his parents who were both really tall basketball players to have a baby and you know, it worked for him. It doesn't always work because it's a crap shoot. But uh, um, it can work. Yeah. And so, but that's normal breeding. That's like a dog. And my dog's a good looking dog. Her dog at the same breed, let's put them together. That's right. With human beings. But yes. Otherwise normal. Yes. And it, it, I think it's different. It's different psychologically because we think it's different winning the lottery than already being rich and therefore being able to afford something that changes who you are. Right. I think that, I don't know, maybe I'm wrong. Maybe people will think that that's awesome. And will these people will be celebrities and we'll follow them on instagram, but I suspect people be rubbed the wrong way at that kind of access to something that most people can't afford it most certainly will. The most certainly. Well, but I think if you look at it objectively, if you look at the interactions of the species, as you know, a completely a outside observer, you would say not only is this inevitable, but this is going to lead to some really spectacular changes in what a human being is like. Think about a big part of what we're concerned with constantly on a daily basis is healthcare, right? People were very concerned

Speaker 1:          00:26:44       with people that have to deal with debilitating diseases and if we could just eliminate all those. Yeah. Why wouldn't you want that? I think you probably will be able to, and it will probably happen. That I think is. Yeah, but then so far almost everyone agrees with that. Like it's not the controversial part, right? Like yeah, if we can eliminate, and apparently some diseases we already know like right there in your DNA, you're going to get Huntington's when you're 40 years old. Right? And so those are easy to eliminate peanut allergies or something like that to other diseases are harder. We don't know what causes them, so it'll take time, but I think that there'll be uncontroversial if you could just remove diseases from people ahead of time. It's a little bit different if you're choosing their hair color and skin color and shape of their nose and feed and whatever.

Speaker 1:          00:27:26       That gets a little squirrelly, but it's also when the idea of it being a cost prohibitive issue. Well isn't that the case with almost all technology as it emerges? It's very memorable. Plasma Tvs, we're like $20,000 for a small television. I remember I saw them. It was only like a 30 inch television or something like that was exorbitant and I was like, this is incredible. Flat hangs on the wall now. Everybody has them and they're cheap. You can get one for a few hundred bucks and it's way bigger and way better than what it was back then. Yeah, and I think they actually, that's very realistic. That maybe will be million dollars, but then 10 years later we'll be $100,000 to sort of be a million dollars first. Right. It kind of just like cell phones, like everything else, it has to be a really expensive thing and then eventually trickles down like cell phones and becomes available everywhere to everybody.

Speaker 1:          00:28:20       Like if you look at the average person's cell phone, if you buy the cheap cell phone for like 300 bucks, it is way better than an iphone from 10 years ago. Yeah. In every way. Yeah. No, I think that's probably right. And I think that it's one of the things that's happening, like we're, we're still at the beginning of technology, right? Technology's not that advanced compared to where it's going to be. Um, you know, I have another podcast guests coming up who is an expert on aging and how we can fix that by messing with jeans a little bit gray. No, no. This was a real scientist at Princeton. You know, someone who's just doing experimental scientists. Uh, well he's, I don't know him that well, so I shouldn't say, but I, I think of it as an advocate for anti aging, which is good, which is cool.

Speaker 1:          00:29:06       But, but my guest, Colleen Murphy, he's just like a biologist who was working on things and discovered something that was, she's not trying that hard, right? Uh, you knock out a certain gene in this certain worm and it lived twice as long and without any twoK , right? Like, it doesn't get old because it's fascinating. Like why do we die? Why do we grow old? It's not necessary. Like you could design an organism that doesn't get older. It would die from random bad things. You get hit on the head with a brick, but you don't need to die. The reality is that evolution programmed aging and death into us because once we have kids or once we've outlived our reproductive lifespan, we're not useful anymore. So biology is once us to die. And so that, that, in other words, it's potentially fixable. You know, it might not be easy, it might be not happened 100 years from now, but it could.

Speaker 1:          00:29:56       So I think that, you know, aging, genetic engineering, brain, computer interfaces, you know, all that stuff is going to within the next hundred years totally changed what it means to be human being and we're totally not ready for it. And so I was saying this to Carl [inaudible] Carl's like, not that Carl Zimmer was more or less sanguine about is like don't worry, just, you know, we'll put regulations on, it'll be fine. And my attitude was, no, actually we should think of the absolute craziest science fiction scenarios because I want to be prepared, right. You know, it doesn't come to pass. I want to worry about the least probable things because it might spark something that actually helps us down the road. Yeah. There was a recent discovery. They figured out a way to shut off whatever it is that causes wrinkles and reverse the process. So whatever is causing your skin to get wrinkly and sag, they're reversing that process.

Speaker 1:          00:30:45       We might be members of the last generation to die of old age. We won't be a mortal. Well then if you thought you were immortal, if you thought, well, let's say that you thought that your average lifespan was a million years, would you suddenly become way more cautious? Oh, start jumping off buildings and shit would do. Like I have a friend of mine who does the flying squirrel suit stuff. He holds the world. You don't become vulnerable. You just don't. Exactly. Flying Squirrels type is truly dangerous. Oh, it's super dangerous. Yeah. Base jump. What if they could just fix you if you like even, but that's a separate thing. Yes, that's possible. Right? Like maybe they get back to your go back, you up, you just die, but they build to your clone, put you back together. Like all these crazy science fiction series. I don't think that that's.

Speaker 1:          00:31:30       I think the backing up is way harder than people think, but I think that stopping aging is way easier than people think. But we'll see. I agree with you. Uh, I went to the 20, 45, I think they're calling it a conference in New York City a few years back ago. It's all the ray Kurzweil advocates that think you're going to download brains into computers and stuff. Not that compelling like that, that stuff. I was like, what are you going to do with what's going to happen? It seems like everybody had this idea of one day we'll be able to do this and we'll be able to take consciousness, and I'm like, yeah, it's not. I mean a, b doesn't violate the laws of physics, but it's hopelessly impractical compared to anything we can do right now. Like the human brain is just not something you can read out. My question, and this was something that really concerned me was what's to keep someone from making hundreds of thousands of versions of themselves?

Speaker 1:          00:32:22       Like what if, what to take someone from some, you know, really rich billionaire character that can afford to do this and say, I'm going to do this many, many times. Then I'm going to have my clones make clones of clones and I'm going to fill up a whole island with me. Why would you do that though? Because you're a crazy person. Okay. I mean, crazy. People are allowed to do crazy things, but imagine if you had 100 Sean Carroll's near House working on things but it, but they're not the same person. What if you found that the 30, the Sean Carroll Smoking crack and hookers drawing fast direction. Imagine. Have you realized that that like after a while there, there is a random. Sure, yeah. Is Evo Devo, right? Did you grow up in matters? That would be really fascinating if that would be an excellent episode of black mirror where someone clone themselves and found out that a certain percentage of the clowns were just fucking crazy or they were the crazy one.

Speaker 1:          00:33:20       Right? Like all the clones were very different than them and they rolled seem to each other or maybe having all those clones somehow or another set something off in them that made them crazy because they were in competition with all these other people that were exactly like them. This is golden. Yeah. We should edit this out of the podcast so we can write up this episode. There's a real concern with messing with biology in a way that's never been done before. Exactly, and I think that the extent to which it's coming is something we haven't quite faced up to you and it's really coming. It's coming fast and profoundly and we're not ready. Yeah. And the possibility of just creating a world that we're not prepared for and we're not prepared for the consequences of. Yeah, exactly.

Speaker 2:          00:34:04       All in favor of thinking crazy. Right? Like just wondering what it will be like even if the answer is no, that'll never happen. At least, you know, be prepared a little bit. Uh, you know, think of all the alarms.

Speaker 1:          00:34:14       Crazy scenarios. Yeah. Um, have you really gotten into crispr? Have you really looked into that stuff at all? Not that much, you know, a little too applied to real world for my taste, but people don't know what we're talking about. We're talking, it's a new technique for editing genes that was discovered accidentally while examining the effects of the story is it's

Speaker 2:          00:34:37       amazing. I mean there are these bacteria, you know, so we, here's the thing, we think of DNA as where our genetic information is stored, right? Like you have a little code, it's a little list of symbols, a cgt and their inner hero and that's it. That is handed down from parents to children, but the reality is way more complicated than that because different parts of the DNA do things and different ones don't. Some of them get turned on, turned off. We have mitochondrial DNA which are not our DNA. We had these little sub cells within us that get carried along for the ride and have their own DNA and so crispr is this thing that was invented by nature, right? Not by human beings. These bacteria who were trying to resist viruses. Right? So the viruses would come in and attack them and basically the de, the bacteria learned away to steel part of the DNA of the virus and keep it as like a facial recognition software.

Speaker 2:          00:35:37       It's like a template. Like, Oh, this DNA thing is approaching me that's a virus and I should attack it. Right? Like this is something that I knew. I learned how to fight off. And so to do that need to be able to snip out a little piece of DNA. And so scientists, biologists learned that they could train, this is a little bit fanciful way, putting it metaphorical, but they could train the bacteria to go in there, snip out pieces of DNA, and you can do that for any dna you want. So, but, and you can replace it with something else. Uh, it's not really very high precision right now, but that's coming. And so in principle, this is, you know, a little way to change the genetic code and then they figured out some other way that ordinarily, right, if you have two parents and you have like Brown eyes versus blue eyes and blue eyes are recessive.

Speaker 2:          00:36:27       So they both need to have the blue eye gene to give you if you want to have blue eyes. But they figured out a way that you can change the DNA and it automatically with 100 percent accuracy gets sent to all of your offspring, right? It's not 50 slash 50 chance or whatever. Uh, so then you can just say, propagate a change in the genetic code throughout the species pretty darn quickly. And your human beings take a long time to breed. But animals and plants, it's a whole nother world, right? You can design those very, very rapidly and there's already been at least one revision of the process, right? I think so, but yeah. The. I think I just told you everything I know

Speaker 3:          00:37:01       continuing to improve on the process and it's really, it's really gonna be very interesting to see where that goes as far as that advances. Yeah. I think this was a concern with places like China, right? They're already doing this. They're already manipulating genetics and trying to create super people

Speaker 2:          00:37:19       and I think that the chances that gives them a great basketball team or greater than the chances that it gave them a bunch of brilliant phd scientist.

Speaker 3:          00:37:24       Well that's where it starts, right in. A lot of it starts in competitive athletics. Have you paid attention? Did you watch the documentary? ICARUS? No, I did not. Fascinating documentary that's on Netflix right now about it's. It really is kind of a crazy set of circumstances. There's a guy named Bryan Fogel, he's the director of the producer of the movie and he was competitive bike racer and he decided to document what he wanted to do was compete in a race, a bike race, a hundred percent clean, and then get a Russian scientist to juice them up. So in the process of getting this Russian scientists to juice them up, he stumbled upon a scandal and in the middle of him making that, but it means in a crazy way because this Russian guy is the head of the Anti Doping Agency in Russia and it was just sort of informing him how you would do this.

Speaker 3:          00:38:17       So he teaches him and forms of how you can do this. While this is all going on. It turns out that the Russians had completely cheated their way through the Sochi Olympics now and it was all documented and so they were getting busted. As this is all going on and he films this Russian who's the head of it, escaping Russia, barely coming to the United States and being chased and testifying all the different strategies that the Russians used in order to completely cheat on, like at least one entire Olympic team, like every single athlete was on drugs and they had a record number of gold medals and so then he starts detailing the process and how they did it and they use forensic test, examined the urine bottles and showed that they've been opened even though they were supposedly not openable and really, really interesting stuff, but that national pride, the thing about a national pride and you know, the, the ability to win a bunch of gold medals and athletic dominance is so important for the morale of, of these countries that want to establish superiority,

Speaker 2:          00:39:27       right? Yeah. And there are some people who say, well, let's just go for it. Let's have the old dope Olympics. Right? Like people enhance themselves as much as they possibly can. And there's an ongoing debate about what about people who use prosthetics, right? Is that fair? If you lost a leg and you have a prosthetic leg, because could that potentially give you an advantage in a running event or something like that? If it were a sufficiently good prosthetic eye? I don't know the answer to any of these questions. I think it's a little bit weird because we set up these arbitrary categories for what is it, a sporting event and we invented them, right? They're not out there in the world and now we're faced with wholly different circumstances to what to do about it, but yeah, I think that, you know, there's. There's the question of what we should do, which is hard. There's the question of what's going to happen, which is it's all going to happen. All of these things are gonna happen.

Speaker 3:          00:40:15       I was talking to a guy this past weekend who's a navy seal and his friend lost his hand and they gave him a new hand and they're working on this new handout that's going to allow him to play piano. So it's a completely artificial carbon fiber hand with all these different things that attach directly to your nerves and somehow or another he can control it with

Speaker 2:          00:40:38       his arm that's going to allow him to play piano and you're going to tell me that he could never play the piano before. Right now he knows it's in the. It's in the thing. It's. Yeah. Well this is what I was saying about the brain computer interfaces. I think that's the real. That's even bigger frontier than synthetic biology or genetic engineering because computers are really useful for things. Robots are very useful for things. Human beings are just going to sort of blend in. It's not like we're gonna have ai and super healthy humans. It's, we're gonna just have everywhere on that spectrum. Yeah, that's what I'm thinking as well. There's going to be some sort of a symbiotic thing like a chip or you know, they tried it with the Google glasses. Could try to get people to wear that. But they were goofy. Yeah. I put them on. They felt too science fictiony. Just like the first portable phones were these giant things. Right? That doesn't matter. Right. That's not a longterm prognostication tool. Yeah. Lots of, uh, lots of people are working on it. Elan Musk has a little company that no one knows, uh, that

Speaker 1:          00:41:34       as they do now. Yeah. Well, people know about it if they care, but it's not like one of his famous ones, right. Um, to, to implant a neural lace or something in your body that reads your brain neuro lace. I don't like the way that sounds. Whereas if you want a more macho, wanted the back of your head to open up your schedule. But I didn't think of it as I was thinking of it as like a mesh. Yeah, that's what, that's. It just seems creepy that it's going to latch onto your nerves and improve you. Yeah. Neuro lace. You won't need your phone anymore. Wow. And where's you went to the back of your head? Everyone goes to the back of their head will always go. Well, I mean, like the Matrix. Everybody goes to the back of their head. Yeah. I mean, right now, uh, companies that want to make money in the short term are building these nonsurgical, noninvasive things we like were something on the front of your head or wear a cap or something like that, which can detect frequencies, vibrations in your brain and you can, it's very primitive, but you can move things around, you can control drones with your brain without touching anything.

Speaker 1:          00:42:41       Uh, but yeah, the, if it ever becomes practical, which is very far from certain, but the thing to imagine in the far outside fiction scenario is cracking open your skull and inserting some electrodes in their, closing it back up. And now you're part of the Super Internet without doing anything more than closing your eyes. Yeah. And there's also the possibility of enhancing various, uh, thought processes to with transdermal stimulation. Like if they could figure out, you know, they're doing that now they're, they've performed a series of tests where they have people do like certain tasks and then they put electrodes in a certain areas of the brain and put an electric charge. And that electric charge stimulates various aspects of the brain and it allows them to complete certain tasks quicker and more efficiently. You know, I think, and this is just a kind of uninformed a belief, but I suspect that the human brain is pretty optimized for what it tries to do.

Speaker 1:          00:43:39       I think that rather than improving the brainers, stimulating it the way forward is to augment it, like hook it up to calculators and Internet and whatever. You know, one thing that I don't see talked about very much but I think will be a real game changer. You know, we talked about phones as if we're carrying around phones, but we don't mostly use our phones to talk to people on the phone. Right? We check the email, check the internet and we take pictures once you really have. And again it might not be possible, but if you really had a direct connection between your brain and the Internet, your eyeballs are a video camera. Everything you see, you can record and store somewhere, right? So. And you can lend them to other people or people can subpoena them or whatever. Like there's literally no place in the world that, that human eyeballs are looking at that would not be subject to later inspection.

Speaker 1:          00:44:30       That is weird and scary and bad. Right? It is words carrying bad. And what if someone comes up with a better eyeball? Oh yeah. Scoop out your old doll eyes and put in some new awesome ones that you can record with. Yeah, absolutely. Yeah. I don't think that a nest. I think, I think I absolutely agree that enhancing it with electronics is probably the way to go and that having some sort of, some sort of symbiotic relationship with electronics. But I also think that this transdermal stimulation can enhance that process on top of it. I think there's going to be a bunch of different things going on at once. You won't even think about crispr being something where someone eventually figures out a way to design various aspects of the human brain that are more open to interface with technology, changing various receptors, make them more efficient for data to go straight to the dome.

Speaker 1:          00:45:24       Yeah. And I think that, uh, there is a short term versus long term question here, right? Like even if what I said is a longterm truth on the short term, improving our thinking skills in direct ways with stimulation or whatever sounds pretty good. But maybe you can just do that through Beta blockers. There are some drugs or something like that. Like I think that that's another thing, very plausible that will have safe superefficient drugs. Someone can take it over the next six hours, their way. Clear thinkers than they were before. Is there any concern with what's the end game like what's all this stuff? I hope so. I mean, if you're a super far advanced, the end game is you realize that life is not that interesting. Yeah. You're like, well why am I here? What am I doing with all this little challenge is helpful actually.

Speaker 1:          00:46:09       Well in particular if you develop a mortality, yeah. If there's no concern about getting injured or killed. Yeah. I think that people who envision super far ahead science fiction scenarios and especially people who envision uploading brains and consciousness underestimate the importance of our bodies to who we are as human beings, right? Not just that we're in a body, but like hunger, thirst, exhaustion, being horny, like these are motivating factors that really affect who we are and what we say and what we do and if you remove all that, if you're just a thinking processor in a computer, what's your motivation? Why are you going on? Right? Like what are you doing anything at all? Like I don't think it'll be. I don't think it will be anything like the personality, the person who you are. If your body is taken away. That's the big question about artificial life, right? Our or artificial intelligence rather like what we have very specific needs that are addressed by our ambitions, right? Biological need, the idea of transferring your genes, keeping your, your bloodline, going, all that stuff. There's all these survival instincts that we have that you necessarily wouldn't necessarily have if you are an artificial life form. Like why would you care if someone pulled the plug on you? Why would you try to

Speaker 3:          00:47:30       survive? What do you. What's your purpose here? Right. Exact same sort of futile. If you're.

Speaker 2:          00:47:34       There's a lot of talk in the Ai, a existential risk community, like worrying about artificial intelligence, about value alignment, like making sure that the ais value the same things that we do. Like our existence for example, right? Yeah, and, but I think a little bit, at least what I hear, and I'm not an expert, but I hear it seems a little bit off the mark because they're talking about what to program into the AI, but if it's in any sense really an ai, it can reprogram itself, right? You can change your mind as a human being. You can change your values. You can change your motivations. Artificial intelligence is should be able to do the same thing and in fact they better be able to do that if they're going to be truly intelligent. If they're. If we're going to mimic what a human being can do, a, it can't be something where we programmed them, just do a task because that's not intelligent. Right? So if that happens there, then you know who knows what they're going to eventually be motivated to do. If anything, like you said, like what is their motivation even to do anything at all or even to exist?

Speaker 3:          00:48:34       Well isn't. One of the big concerns is that in releasing artificial technology and giving it autonomy that we're going to do is like start a process that some sort of a perpetual exponential domino effect of technology where this new artificial life is going to create better artificial life which creates better artificial life, which expands to godlike powers within a very short period of time and decides where he's stupid and useless and just eliminates us and then it gets bored and shuts itself off. Yeah. He goes, what are we doing here? The Sun's going to burn out and these are hard

Speaker 2:          00:49:13       things to even extrapolate because they're so far beyond our experience, but I do think that we're opening up doors that we never had before. Between between a genetic modifications of human beings, artificial intelligence, brain computer interfaces, uh, we, we don't have the experience or the capacity to really even ask the right questions about these things.

Speaker 3:          00:49:34       Right? We're sort of rudimentary. Early were rudimentary idea. The idea is that we have of like what is necessary or really based on our own biological needs. We have family. We want to keep everybody healthy, we enjoy our community, we want to keep it safe. We enjoy our, our earth who want to keep it clean. We want to, we want to save things for the future generations and all these concerns that we have that are very biological, they just won't exist for artificial life.

Speaker 2:          00:50:07       That's exactly right. And I think that what we're really good at or what we're better at in terms of imagining the future is taking what already exists and just expanding it, right? Like, so when people. I think that maybe you talked about this in the last podcast, but uh, when people first started imagining mechanical devices to carry you around mechanical transportation in the late 18 hundreds, they imagined a mechanical horse cause they knew the horse has existed, right? And the car was a totally different thing and people hadn't thought of that originally. And then when people did think of cars, they thought of flying cars because they solved there were flying animals, right? And the flying cars haven't appeared because w, w we didn't what they should have been thinking about it. How are cars going to change our cities and our commutes and how we live, right? Uh, when people invented the Internet that were, they weren't sure what they were going to do with it. And I think that the same thing is true when, when, if we can imagine blending the barrier between our biological existence in some virtual existence, we don't even know what questions to ask about that.

Speaker 3:          00:51:06       Yeah. And I think we are getting close to those other things that you mentioned though. Boston dynamics is getting really close to artificial dogs and artificial horses. I mean, they have things that you can't kick, you kick them and they, they don't get knocked over and open doors. Yes. They can jump like incredible distances, incredible heights. Um, there's, there's some amazing ones that do acrobatics now. We've seen that where they're going to replace stuntman in movies that could potentially get harmed with these robots that can do crazy back flips and jump off buildings and the next big war is going to look very, very different than very weird. Right. That's, hopefully it won't happen, but if it does, yeah, it's gonna. There's a big emphasis on automated things. Not just drones, but physical things that are running around on the grass and make decisions that.

Speaker 3:          00:51:57       Give it a little bit of Ai. Then. Do you watch dark mirror? Uh, I haven't seen it, you know, does it make in my queue? There's an insane episode on. Do you remember the name of it? The one with Black Mirror, black mirror. That's a dark mirror. Black Mirror is insane episode on these little robots that are chasing metal face, metal head, something like that. Yeah, it's about a robots chasing after this lady. And it's, it literally is these little tiny Boston dynamic robots, but they can kill you and they're there on a mission and this is not outside the realm of possibility at all. Nope.

Speaker 2:          00:52:36       It really isn't. And like I said, it's, we don't even know. It's easy to extrapolate right ahead. Just ordered the Sarah differences. There it is.

Speaker 3:          00:52:45       That's from the episode. It's a fantastic episode two. There's so many good episodes of that show. Black Mirror is just amazing. Yeah. I guess start watched. Um, but that, that's a concern. I mean there's, there's a real concern. I mean we're, we're doing it right now with drones, you know, if you talk to people that are really, that have paid attention to studied drone warfare and how incredibly inhumane it is and how different it is from any other type of warfare in terms of is like the ability to rationalize targets when you're not there yet. And you're, you have, you're nowhere near and you're just pressing buttons and you decide

Speaker 1:          00:53:26       like little bell does a very good possibility. This person's in here. Fuck it. Nuke the building. Yeah. And we're, I think we're doing that. Yes, absolutely happening. But on the other hand, the drones are also delivering pizzas. Are they though? I got a pizza with a drone thing. So if you looked at the amount of people that have delivered pizzas with drones versus the amount of people that have been killed by drones, especially killing is bigger. Well, the innocence of the scariest drones are really good at killing innocent people. Not so good at killing the people that are specific target targets. But I think my, my point is just that, uh, there are going to be pluses and minuses, right? So I think that it's going to change. Like if we, if we combine this idea of, you know, interfacing with computers with this idea of drones, doing some drugs, rework with this idea of giving people a basic income.

Speaker 1:          00:54:11       Everyone is just going to sit in their rooms and then write on their. Tumblr is all day. That's gonna be the future. I don't think they're going to be writing anymore. I think this is a real possibility that we're going to create virtual reality that's indistinguishable from regular reality. And people are going to live in, they're like ready player, one will be better kind of thing. I think that the big flaw to me and things like trauma and are ready player one is that they make the virtual reality look too much like the real reality. There's no reason why virtual reality has to have gravity. There's no reason why it has to be three dimensional. There's no reason why. You know you have any limit on how strong you are, how fast you are, and if. Yeah, like there's no reason why you have to have only one body.

Speaker 1:          00:54:50       I mean there's a million different ways in which it could be very, very different. Well, it also can be implemented with something like the tank, the float tank that we were talking about earlier. I mean you could climb into that float tank with some sort of apparatus. Hook these gloves on, put this helmet over, and literally not be subject to the whims of gravity. You can't even feel it. Effects of gravity will be inconsequential because you will feel like you're floating. And then from there you'll be able to fly around. And do all sorts of, yeah, I think like this weird period between, you know, the year 1900 and 2000 or 2000, 100 or whatever it's going to be a, it'll be a weird transitional period in human history where we invented technology and not really put it to work yet and there might be some equilibrium that we reach and 100 or 200 years where the whole mode of life is utterly different than what it is now.

Speaker 1:          00:55:39       If you could put priorities in terms of like what you think people should concentrate on first when in regards to this kind of stuff, what do you think those would be like if someone said, Shawn, you're a super smart dude. Let's, uh, let's get on the ball here, figure out what direction should we take this in. I mean, what I do for living is more like foundational. What are the laws of physics kind of thing. Right? So I'm not the person to speculate on this stuff, but. Well, I think, um, this is why I said earlier like I think we should be talking to each other because nobody is, no one person is right. Like that's why we need to have people from different areas of expertise talk about each other's areas if only then to be corrected, right? But you know, to be open to that dialogue. So I think that for example,

Speaker 2:          00:56:24       an enormous amount of effort has been put into nanotechnology building tiny little machines. I suspect that mostly the real, uh, advances, they are not going to be in nanotechnology, but in synthetic biology where you take bacteria are multicellular organisms that already exists and adapt them for your purposes, make them do whatever you want. Because biology has already solved a lot of the problems that a technology is still struggling to figure out.

Speaker 3:          00:56:48       So the concept of nanotechnologies you're going to take like almost like a cell sized machine, right? And many of them going to go into your body and find areas that are damaged or whatever. Yeah,

Speaker 2:          00:57:00       there's a woman, a professor at Caltech who gave a talk a few months ago about tea builds robots out of DNA, so they're these little DNA robots can go in and right now they're at the level where what they can do is sort thing. So like if they have a molecule one and molecule to scattered across some surface, this little DNA robot will go in and we've all molecule one to the left, all of molecule due to the right and so she says that's the beginning. Like in the future you'll have your little DNA box and you'll say, you know, I'm allergic to tomatoes, and then it will invent a little machine that will run through your body and fix your allergy tomatoes. Right? You don't need that anymore with a machine with a DNA robots. So it's literally. So why DNA, because you think of DNA is carrying the genetic code, but DNA is a wonderful molecule because it is relatively stable, but it's not just a crystal, right? It's not just doing the same thing over and over again. So it contains information and it can adapt. It can. It can, you know, uh, hold on and grab onto certain things and let go and, and do things. So DNA is a wonderful testing ground for building little really, really tiny things in your body that will change who you are.

Speaker 3:          00:58:11       Here's a question that's not totally related, but you might be a good person for this. What is quantum computing now? [inaudible] I keep hearing about this. That's one of the big breakthroughs in, in computers is going to be quantum computing, right?

Speaker 2:          00:58:28       I'm almost the right guy. I'm not completed the color. I actually did teach a course at Caltech that involve quantum computing. So I'm above average, definitely the best, but yeah. So, um, so quantum mechanics, this is the book that I'm writing right now, uh, that's gonna be a year from now called something deeply hidden. It'll be about quantum mechanics and the goal of the book will be to make quantum mechanics understandable to everybody and convinced them that quantum mechanics really does imply the existence of multiple worlds where things look very much the same except for tiny differences. And one way of thinking that will quantum mechanics says is in classical mechanics, which is what came before quantum mechanics. Let's imagine you have a bit right? That is something is either zero or one right? One piece of information. In quantum mechanics, you have a quantum bit accubid as they call it, very clever.

Speaker 2:          00:59:16       So the difference is that instead of it being a zero or a one, like it would be classically quantum, mechanically, it is in some super position of zero and one and some combination of a little bit zero, a little bit one. And it's not that you don't know which one it is, it's that it really is both. It might be 90 percent zero and 10 percent one or something like that. So take that fact number one fact number two is the quantum mechanics has the thing called entanglement, which means that if you have two bits classically, so you have zero, zero, zero, one, one zero, one, one, four different possibilities. So quantum mechanics says it's not that this one bit is in a combination of zero and one, and this other bit is also in a combination of zero and one, it's that the two bit system is in a combination of zero, zero, zero, one, one zero, one one, right?

Speaker 2:          01:00:08       So it might be that it's 50 percent zero, zero and 50 percent one one. So you don't know what either bit is, but he know they're the same, right? So that's entanglement. So you take these two ideas that you have a combination of Zeros and ones rather than just one or the other and the different bits can be entangled with each other. And then you just say, well what is a computer? A computer is something that takes bits in, does manipulations, and spits out the answer, right? You solve problems, you. That's what's literally going on. And your computer as a bunch of zeroes and ones being pushed around. So a quantum computer is pushing out a bunch of cubits, right? Bunch of spinning particles or something like that. The spin of a particle that can either be spinning clockwise or counterclockwise is a cupid, and so these particles can interact with each other, they can become entangled and you invent a quantum algorithm, right?

Speaker 2:          01:00:55       Like there's algorithms for finding the area of a surface or something like that. Factoring large numbers, you know, solving the shortest distance between two different points. You can do this using the rules of quantum mechanics instead of the rules of classical mechanics and the belief which is not yet 100 percent established, but we think is true is that there are some problems that are really, really hard to solve for a classical computer, which means that you can easily make the problem long enough that it would take the lifetime of the universe to solve it on a classical computer which quantum computers can solve quite quickly and efficiently. And so it's. We're not, we haven't proven that it's not a mathematically why. Why would they think that quantum computers will be able to solve it quicker? There's more information in the quantum computer, like if you have two bits, zero, zero, zero, one, etc.

Speaker 2:          01:01:44       There's only four things that can be right if you have a quantum computer is an infinite number of things it can be because it's any combination of those four things, right? Ten percent this, 20 percent that. So There's like a continuum of possibilities. It's, it's analog rather than digital in some sense. And so what you, what you can do, you know, the, the quantum computer can just sort of take advantage of that extra power, um, to look, I mean, because of this entanglement, what this is, this is I'm going to get in trouble with my quantum computing friends because not quite fair, but roughly speaking rather than manipulating bit by bit because of the entanglement between the bits. The quantum computer can move all the bits a little bit at once. So let's say that you're, you're searching for something in the list, right? A very elementary, a computer science program is, I'm giving you a list.

Speaker 2:          01:02:33       find an element that is equal to a certain number, right? It sounds easy, but if that list is 10 trillion things long, that's hard. Right? So what the quantum computer can do is say, take every element in the list, nudge it a little bit towards zero if it's the wrong answer in towards one if it's the right answer and you don't know where it is in the list, but you can do that nudging over and over again. At the end of the day, you look for where's the one it's very easy to find so you can get the answer much quicker. It is believed. and so things like cryptography, privacy, right or dramatically changed by this because if one of the things that we think quantum computers should be able to do faster is factor large numbers, which is the, the, the difficulty in factoring large numbers is the basis for much modern cryptography, uh, but also simulating systems that were just too difficult to simulate, you know, just, just took too much computer power to do it.

Speaker 2:          01:03:26       Now maybe we can do it because nature is truly quantum mechanical. At the core, it turns out to be very hard because the problem is you have all these bits. If you touch one of them, if the outside world bumps into one of them, right, like a cosmic ray or adam hits it, the whole entanglement is ruined between everything. So it's very, very delicate and that's what the, you know right now, um, they're, they're working on systems of let's say dozens of cubits entangled at once. You would, you would like it to be way more than that because you can store an enormous amount of information in these things and uh, if it works as I think it'll be way better at computing if it works. I'm not at all sure that quantum computers will be efficient or cost effective or anything like that in the near term.

Speaker 2:          01:04:12       But you know, doing computations faster or something is a lot of people wouldn't be able to do so right now they're working with dozens of cubits and what's preventing them from expanding that or they're doing it slowly, sort of make sure that it all works correctly and get a, an accurate model. Yeah. So the problem is if you had a cubit, it can be in a combination of zero or one, right? Any combination whatsoever, but as soon as you look at it, you never see the combination. You see zero or you see one that's it and you've ruined. You've erased this preexisting combination. If you see zero, now it's in the state zero c one, it's in the state one. So if you have a group of many, many cubits, what I mean by look at is literally anything else in the world bumping into it.

Speaker 2:          01:04:56       So like if, like I said, if photons headed, if particles, uh, you know, if, if molecules of air and oxygen or nitrogen bump into the cubit, that'll count as an observation and it will collapse as we say, it collapses the wave function and then all of your quantum information is ruined. So, uh, you have to make them a sort of very cold, very isolated, very from external influences. And the more cubits you add, the harder that is to do well. Now, was there a proof of concept this? Yep. They have working quantum computers. I forget. There was a joke. Scott aaronson, who's a friend of mine who's a genius, a theoretical computer scientist. he used to joke that the quantum computers are able to say that the number 15 is equal to five times three with very high probability. That was the state of the art.

Speaker 2:          01:05:44       I think they're able to say that 21 equals three times seven with very high probability now. But, uh, what you would like to say is, you know, some hundred digit number is the product of two other numbers not able to do that right now. Now, what are they looking at with this and when they're, when they're looking at in terms of the future, this stuff, what are the, how do they want to implement this? Lots of different ways actually, like the actual physical technology that they're using. Some people are using adam's, some people are using sort of um, uh, features of condensed matter systems like two dimensional systems where electrons are moving slowly and can wind around each other and things like that. ThiS is way beyond what I actually know about, but also this sort of side light of this is that this existence of entanglement, um, it's kind of a shared information between two different things.

Speaker 2:          01:06:31       In a way that classical physics just would not allow, and that's interesting and exciting because it opens up ways, uh, for, for sharing information that other people can't get to because you have some information. Your friend has some information, but it's, it, you need both pieces of it to get to it. Right. I'm seth lloyd, who's another friend of mine at mit, professor said that he was, he tells a story where he was in a hot tub with the google guys, right with sergey and larry and you know, the heads of google, the founders, and he said, oh, I came up with this brilliant new idea where we can use quantum mechanics build a quantum computer so that a person who does a search, a google search using this quantum computer, they can do a search and they can get their answer, but it is literally impossible for anyone else to ever know what they searched for.

Speaker 2:          01:07:22       And the google guys are like very excited and they went away. The next day they came back and said, oh, we realized this is the opposite of our business model. It's really important to us that we know what he's right. That's the whole thing with them. Google ads, google ad sense. When you go to another website, it's shows you, oh, sean's been looking at, you know, lenovo laptops and they follow you around and all your other devices, your cookies. Creepy. But yeah, so In quantum in quantum computing is there's quantum money, there's quantum cryptography, there's quantum eavesdropping, things like that. So it's just, uh, it's, it's easy to speculate about. I would not say the actual technology is very far advanced right now, but I can't tell you how quickly. Why wouldn't someone like google just have to adjust? Because prior to these google ads, you'd never really knew what someone was interested in unless they took

Speaker 3:          01:08:16       surveys or unless they had purchasing history. are there had to be some way that you could now that just detecting off of searches and that's what their business model is. That doesn't mean they can't come up with a better new business model. They will have to adapt, but they are not in the business of making that happen. No stAte now. It's so effective. If they were really smart, they would have given $100,000 and they didn't tell no one about this ever again. Is that enough? Yeah. we found out what the stormy daniels case. That hundred thousand dollars doesn't buy a lot of two thirds of a stormy daniel. What do you think they'll like? What will be the first way they try to use something like this? They try to use quantum computing.

Speaker 2:          01:08:59       I don't know. I think that, um, you know, the people who are really interested in now are, uh, the nsa in the dod, right? A national security agency and the department of defense because secret messages are the most obvious thing. I'm cracking codes and things like that. That's like the killer app that we know about right now. I'm a physicist. Of course, when you use it to simulate quantum mechanical systems to learn about other behavior materials, like maybe you will build a better super conductor or something like that right away. Maybe you'll do better designing of your genetically engineered dna on a quantum computer. Right? Like there's sort of the generic thought that you'll be able to do computations faster. That's interesting. Then there's more specific things like if the system you're trying to simulate is itself quantum mechanical than simulating it on a quantum computer might be the way to go.

Speaker 3:          01:09:46       Yeah. To most people that just were woo right over their head. What is, what are these guys? The quantum is so weird. Like one of the things that you said earlier, you were, when you were talking about quantum, you were talking about worlds that are very similar but with very small differences, right? Yes. So, uh, yeah, I forget whether we talked about this last time. Um,

Speaker 2:          01:10:08       but you know, so there's this whole version of quantum. Well let me, let me back up because we. okay, right. Sure. Quantum mechanics is weird because among other things it is by far the most successful theory of physics ever invented. We've tested it to enormous precision, right? There's zero evidence. Quantum mechanics is in any way not right, but we don't understand it. We don't, we are not just people in the street like professional physicists don't know exactly what quantum mechanics says, so how do you practice it? Well, we have a recipe. We have a black box, right? The way that I, I put it in the book is imagine you had a website you could go to and you would say, you know, if I threw a ball with certain velocity in a certain direction, how far would it go? And it will give you the answer right away depending upon.

Speaker 2:          01:10:49       Does that. Yeah. Did you put all the details and it gives you the answer. Does that count as you knowing the laws of physics, you know? No. You just have a black box, right? Well that's what quantum mechanics is right now. If we set up an experiment, we can say what the probability of every answer is going to be every outcome, but if you say, well, why? What happened? We don't know, or we don't agree like different people disagree with each other and so this version of quantum, there's different that try to answer this question, what's really going on beneath the surface? Right? What's what's the deep down story of the world and one of these stories is the many worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics and it was invented by a graduate student, whoever in the 19 fifties who was instantly kicked out of physics because really?

Speaker 2:          01:11:31       Yeah. Oh yeah. That is a long unglorious history of people trying to think deeply about quantum mechanics and being shunned in the community for doing so because we've set up this weird thing where, I mean, there was literally a memo that went around the major physics journal. The United States said we will not even look at papers that try to think about the foundations of quantum mechanics. Uh, it's embarrassing. It's terrible. It's like we need to do like real work, like shut up and calculate, you know, we need to build bombs and things not think about the nature of reality, which I think is very much antithetical to what physicists should be doing. But anyway, so many world says is, well, so what we. When we do talk about quantum mechanics, but let's say we have a cube and we have a spinning particle, right? We have this combination of spinning clockwise and counterclockwise, and so we call that the wave function.

Speaker 2:          01:12:17       The wave function is just, it's 10 percent clockwise, 2090 percent counter clockwise or whatever. So to every possible measurement outcome, you give me a number and that number is basically how I figured out the probability of that measurement outcome coming true, and that's the wave function. So there for a long time people thought, well, this is just a trick. This is just like some it, it characterizes our inability to be precise, right? We have a probability of this, a probability of that, but someday they hoped. Einstein, for example, had this hope that we'll have a better theory and we'll know exactly how to predict everything with perfect precision. So whatever it says, no, no, no. It's the other way around. Um, this wave function is reality. That's the whole world, right? That's what reality is. It is a superposition. The combination of all the different possible outcomes.

Speaker 2:          01:13:06       It's not any one outcome. There's no such thing as where the electron is, it's all spread out. And the problem with that is that when you look at the electron spinning, you never see It as a combination of spinning clockwise and counterclockwise. You always see one or the other and everett says, that's because you have a wave function. You live as a superposition of different possibilities. And when you look at the electron, what happens is before there was you and there was an electron and a combination of counterclockwise and clockwise, afterward there is the electron was spinning clockwise and spinning clockwise plus that's 10 percent, the 90 percent. The electron was spinning counterclockwise and you saw that spinning counterclockwise and both possibilities are real, but they're separate. They've branched off from each other, they've gone their own ways. There's separate versions of the world, separate copies of reality. That's why it's called the many worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics. Possibilities is always a big feature. That's the thing that people are constantly discussing, right? What are the possibilities?

Speaker 3:          01:14:12       Predicting the possIbilities and when it comes to human beings, this is also randomly discussed because we, we, we talk about determinism versus freewill. We talk about what are the, what, what's created, what are the possibilities that is created as Sean Carroll and why? Why do you think the way you think and why are you going to say the next thing you're going to say and is it, how much of it is biological, how much of it is your life experience, how much of it is information that's dancing in your head? How much are you interacting with me? The last thing that I've said to you.

Speaker 2:          01:14:43       Yeah, so I had a. I was on the same harris's podcast. We had a long conversation about this because he is very anti freewill and I think that it's. I, I disagree with him but I don't care. I think kind of boring to be honest, as he was born. I think it's boring because here's what I think it's boring because there's two questions. One question is how does the world work? And the other question is what words should be attached to how the world works and the first one is interesting and the second one is kind of boring. I see what you're saying. I've seen seminar, I agree on how the world works, right? But I am what philosophers call a compatiblist when it comes to freewill, which, which is, I don't think that I have some ways of thinking my way into overcoming the laws of physics, right?

Speaker 2:          01:15:24       Like I'm made of atoms made, uh, particles that obey the laws of physics. If I talk about myself as a large collection of atoms and particles obeying the laws of physics, then clearly there's no free will. There's just the solution to the equations and sometimes the wave function branches and there's now two of me, but that's whatever it is. There's no spark of consciousness that lets me overcome what the equation site is going to happen. But guess what? That's not a fruitful way to go through your life in terms of talking about human beings. When you meet somebody for the first time and you say like, you know, what do you do? Who are you? They don't give you a list of their atoms and say what every atom is doing and say, let you let go ahead and solve for triggers equation to figure out what's going to happen next.

Speaker 2:          01:16:05       Right? You tell a story, you say like you're a person, you know you grew up in a certain place, you have a certain jobs, stuff like that. You dramatically condense the information about who you are into a few salient points and among those salient points are I am a person who thinks and makes decisions. Every person in the world, no matter how anti-free will they are talks about people as if they make decisions and the reason they do is because that's how people are. That's the best way to talk about people. It's not like just a compromise, like if you don't know the atoms and molecules and somebody's body and you're not infinitely computationally powerful, so you can predict the future, then it's correct to talk about people as agents who make decisions. We call that freewill. I call that freewill. Most philosophers call it free will. If you don't want to call it freewill, be my guest. I don't really know, it doesn't really matter to.

Speaker 3:          01:16:55       I agree with what you're saying. I think that makes a lot of sense and I think that really simplifies a very complex issue. I, when I looked at it and I have had this conversation with sam as well, uh, I totally see his point and I think he makes 100 percent sense. It's as, there's no arguing with it. I really think it's very rational that approach. But I also think that it's very much like what we were talking about earlier, that it's not necessarily just a one or a zero, but it's a combination of these things freewill. There has to, there is some mechanism that chooses to do one thing versus another. There's some computation, there's calculation, there's debate, there's discussion, there's a thing inside of you. Whatever it is, whatever that process is that's causing you to. I mean, how many times have people stayed up all night going over and over and over a certain idea of trying to find a rational conclusion.

Speaker 2:          01:17:51       Oh yeah. All right, well what is that? Is that, is that, is that, this is where the, it actually becomes interesting to talk about the vocabulary we use, right? Because it becomes very, very hard to know where to attach the word. I or you, when you're talking about this, we tend to say I made a decision. Okay, that's fine. Right? I decided to have this can have pure caffeine that you put in front of me and drink it. Um, I could have decided otherwise. So that's the question, like does it make sense to say I could have decided otherwise? And if you define yourself as the following list of atoms and particles in a certain configuration, then no. Then the laws of physics said that that was going to happen. but I don't know what all that is. That's not a useful way of talking.

Speaker 2:          01:18:38       So there's a whole nother way of talking that says I'm a person and I kind of like coffee, but I already had a cup this morning and you know, there's a chance, there's a probability, like you say that I would drink this and it probably that I would not. And those are completely compatible. Although they're different, the only way you get into trouble is if you mix up those two different ways of talking. If you say like I chose to have the coffee because my atoms were following configuration or something like that. right. That's like talking about us as humans and then switching vocabulary. He's talking about us as adams and that's where you get in trouble.

Speaker 3:          01:19:10       Yeah. It's a weird reductionist take on what it means to be a person that thinks.

Speaker 2:          01:19:14       Yeah. Yeah. I think if you say there's no free will in your adams, then I'm with you. I'm on board, but no one in the world goes through life that way for good reason and they never will. It's not going to happen.

Speaker 3:          01:19:25       Yeah. Well he and you could break that all the way down to creativity. Right? Like what? When someone sits down and writes something like where's all that coming from?

Speaker 2:          01:19:35       Yeah. So I think again, there's feminism as well. There is an interesting question about, you know, how much we will ultimately be able to unpack and understand about that. Right. Right now the brain is kind of just a mystery box to us and there's so much we don't know about how people make decisions, how they remember things, how they come up with new ideas, so, so where it matters is how we treat people, right? Like the obvious case is responsibility. Blame. Like if, if you think that a person makes choices, then you can assign responsibility to them for making the choices they made. Yes. That's what we do in the world. If someone chooses to rob a bank, we choose to put them in jail, right? And someone, someone could come along and say, no one ever does this, but someone could come along and say, well, they're just a bunch of atoms obeying laws of physics.

Speaker 2:          01:20:23       How can you blame them? Right? It will pop. That doesn't make any sense, but what if you were minority report, right? What if you could like put someone in an mri in a brain scanner and say, yeah, you know what? Tomorrow they're gonna rob a bank. Do you arrest them? Is that, is that enough? Right. The fact that their brain was hooked up to a to violate the law and the future, is that enough to sign personal responsibility to them for that or do you more do you do the opposite and say, well, it's going to happen no matter what. We can't really blame them.

Speaker 3:          01:20:53       Well, and also if you do catch this thought process is before the actual action takes place, isn't impossible to correct that thought process with education or some sort of awareness training or something where you could shift the consciousness and abruptly sort of disassembled determinism at its most problematic point.

Speaker 2:          01:21:17       Yeah, so there's a. There's a whole kind of a interesting set of ideas that are very popular among philosophers right now, which is the question of moral luck. Oh, so if you're driving down the street and you're buzzed, you're drunk, right? maybe you get home, fine. Maybe someone jumped in front of your car and you run them over because you don't have the agility or the reflexes because you're drunk. Right? So you're the same person. You went home, you're drunk and you're driving home, but depending on the outside world, you ran someone over and killed them where you didn't, but in the world we blame the person who ran somebody over. We, we punish them much more severely than the person who got home safely. Right. That's not their responsibility. They sort of got unlucky there in the world. So should we blame people who had the chance of doing it? No one knows the answer to these questions. These are, these are tricky things. Like we're not very good. We human beings at the thing about these probabilistic counterfactual questions.

Speaker 3:          01:22:17       Yeah. That's a good one. That is. Yeah. Hmm. Yeah. What, who are you then? Yeah. You lucky. Oh yeah. Right. I mean, so much of what happens to us in life we don't get responsibility for, for interfacing with random next every time we step out the door.

Speaker 2:          01:22:34       That's right. But, uh, can you treat people that way consistently? It's hard, right? It's tricky. I'm not giving the answer because I don't know. Yeah. this is, this is tricky stuff. We're certainly not like if you lived in a world where you thought that what happened in the world was preordained that there was all the great playing out as a master plan or at the very least, that there was some sort of a karmic influence that made good things happen to good people, bad things happen to bad people. Then the world makeS more sense, right? Yeah. I don't believe

Speaker 1:          01:23:05       any of that stuff, but at least then the world seems if, if there's something random, you can attach a reason why it happens. There seems to be something to karma in that when you do good things, you make people feel better, they feel about you better, and then they interface with you in a more positive way and that sort of like has this outgoing effect that's not karma. That's just a smart thing to do. Yeah. No, I think that you're right, that we, and maybe this is just sort of a western post enlightenment way of thinking, we tend to sort of think about immediate consequences for our actions for better, for worse, and in the real world sort of generally trying to be good can often pay back in good ways, but the woo woo thing is that we're putting out this good energy and good energy is coming back to us and it's a fun way to look at things.

Speaker 1:          01:23:57       Although there's no evidence that points to it. Yeah, exactly. Like if I'm in a yoga class and my yoga instructor is talking about different energy flowing through different chakras or whatever, I don't care. like it doesn't bother me as long as it makes me, you know, do that exercise. There's a players a little bit, but I'm not going to speak up, let's put it that way. Right. Of course you're not going to stop the class. You're telling bullshit. I would rather have that than you know, if people want to come up with an excuse to be a good person, that's okay. It's funny that yoga class is always the base. That's always where people go to talk about like we're, we're woo comes from. Yeah. Yeah. It's, it's there. Because I've had, you know, I mean if you've done yoga, you know, like there's a whole spectrum, right?

Speaker 1:          01:24:38       Like there's teAchers who are basically just physical therapists and there are people who are complete crazy hippies, you know, you have to think the right thoughts, you know? Yeah. But people are always searching for some understanding of really complex issues and behavior is very complex issue. Sure. Behavior and how you feel like whether you feel good, we, you feel spiritually enriched, whether you feel positive about humanity, like the, all these things are like which what was trying to manipulate these states, whether it's through meditation and mindfulness training, trying to figure out a way to positively interface, you know, it's true. And it goes back to where we started talking about youtube comments because like I said, I do react badly to bed too stupid. Youtube, well you're a human being. Well, I'm a human being, but I think, and I think that the internet does a magnifying, some of our bad tendencies, right? And I think that, you know, among these and until I totally include myself as a bad actor here in the sense that it's just so easy to be sarcastic and put people down and, you know, uh, dIsagree in sort of dismissive ways. I don't think that's good. I would like to live in a world where people, including myself, even when we disagree with people, even when we disagree with people who are stupid and we're not trying to engage them or improve

Speaker 2:          01:26:04       their lives, just, you know, get on with our own lives rather than trying to have a snarky comeback. like I get that there's a purpose to snark and sarcasm and whatever, but it weighs you down. Right? This is why people complain about twitter and social media, like it's so much psychic energy just gets sapped by reading. All oF these complaints on either side has no political bias, right? Like whatever your feelings are, someone else is making you feel down on the internet somewhere. and it does weigh on you. There's also,

Speaker 3:          01:26:32       there's weird impulse that people have with whether it's social, whether it's twitter or youtube comments. This is reductionist take on things to reduce a person down to maybe one statement or misinterpretations of one position and then have that person be dismissed.

Speaker 2:          01:26:55       Yeah. And I, I think, yeah, and it's a tough play. I have, after thinking about it a little bit, I think that it was a bad decision that james gunn got fired, for example. I don't know if you've followed that, that little thing. Guardians of the galaxy, the galaxy guy. Well those were really bad tweets. Oh yeah. They just

Speaker 3:          01:27:12       weren't funny and he wrote a bunch of them and they were a

Speaker 2:          01:27:16       lot, a lot of, a lot of about pedophilia. So I totally get it right. I'm not shocked that he got in trouble that way, but I also think that his response was immediate, incorrect, and grownup. He said he didn't say like, oh, I was young. It was a different time. He says, oh yeah, I did that. It was shitty and it was wrong. And I take responsibility. And I do think we got to let people grow, right? Like that's what most people in this sort of post mi do era have not done when they've been accused of these things. They haven't taken responsibility. They've made made excuses. And I think that a, on twitter, especially twitter, I think it's my favorite social media, but, um, it is too easy to be reductive. It's too easy to be simplistic and to respond. And you're one of, one of the things that annoys me the most about twitter is when someone tries to be good and then 20 other people say, well, you're not being good in precisely the right way.

Speaker 2:          01:28:07       I, I, even though I failed to live up to it myself, I'm trying to be better. I want to be charitable when I deal with other people. I got in trouble on twitter the other day for defending kellyanne conway a little bit. What did she do well, years ago? She did the alternative facts thing. Remember when she said when they were talking about the inauguration crowd and people pointing out like, no, that's just factually incorrect. And she says, well, there are alternative facts. So like, I don't want to defend kellyanne conway, I'm not a defender of her in general. Um, but I think that she just misspoke that one time. I think that what she was trying to say was there are additional facts that we could also look at. Right? And of course that's in a bigger context where she lies all the time and she, you know, uh, let's other people, she is an apologist for other liars.

Speaker 2:          01:28:55       But I, you know, I think that the idea that these people who I disagree with politically are so divorced from reality that they think they can just make up their own reality. No one actually thinks that way. Like the people who, you know, the people who disagree with me about politics or religion or whatever, it's comforting for me to think that they are, you know, just cheerfully making up facts and reality by them selves. They don't think of themselves that way. They think that they're being truthful. They think of they're being rational, incorrect. And so I should at least grant them that that's what they think in their own right.

Speaker 3:          01:29:31       Well, I'm going to disagree with you on that because I don't think that, first of all, I don't think that she's granted any sort of autonomous decision making capabilities. And I think this is probably something that was sat down that they sat down with a team of experts or you know, air quote experts, team of people that were in that, in that you know, room, whether it's press, people are spin doctors where they're trying to figure out a best way to get out of this. And one of the best ways was this concept of alternative facts. Very similar to the. One of the ways where trump was in that meeting with putin at very famous awful meeting that happened recently where he said, I don't see any reason why it would be Russia that's interfering. And then he said afterwards, obviously I misspoke. I thought it was clear what I meant to say.

Speaker 3:          01:30:25       I didn't see any reason why wouldn't be. I shouldn't say. But it's clear if you watch him say it. Yeah. That's not what he sells. Entirely bullshit, entirely bullshit, dangerous bullshit, but I think gary bullshit in my opinion. Yes, it's, it's such a lie. Right? In, in context, the way he's expressing himself and it's clearly he's dismissing it. Like why would it be, why would it be Russia? He's not saying why wouldn't it be Russia because he's standing right next to putin and he would be saying that in a much more measured and you would be. It would be accusing.

Speaker 2:          01:31:03       Yeah. That was clearly a case where he did something really bad and he came home and all of his advisors said that we have to fix this little bit and they came up with a really clumsy, you know, incredibly. That's all they had. That's all they had. Right. Because it's so blatant, right? Alternative facts is also all that. I don't. Well, I. You might be right. Actually, you know what? I didn't really study it very carefully. I think that it was just a spontaneous blurting out a be my favorite too, because here's why. I think that that's probably right because I don't think I was trying to say before, I don't think that's their self-conception. Like people often think that the people that they disagree with a think false things, that's very natural, but they also also like uncharitable he say they know their thinking false things and they're, you know, they're, they're happily making up their own version of reality.

Speaker 2:          01:31:53       And I think that's very rare. I think that happens, like if you're just a con man or whatever, but I think that more often than we wanted to admit people are sincere in their very false beliefs. Right. So I, so I just find it implausible that, uh, I mean kellyanne conway again lies all the time. That is not my defense for my defense of hers. It was just that she would not go out there and say, oh yes, but we're making up new facts. That's just not the kind of thing. Something, it's. She didn't say it that way

Speaker 3:          01:32:21       where she said, there are all turned art. There are alternative facts. Now you got to think that he's playing to the dumbest people in the room all the time and fortunately for him that's a big number. Yeah, and there's a recent thing where he was defending his behavior saying that anyone can act presidential and he stood on stage and he did this sort of like robotic, boring walk back and forth, and then he started talking in a boring way and mocking it. And what's interesting about the video is not just him doing this, which is very silly, but it's also the people behind him thinking it's hilarious. These nazi this. Yeah. See if he could find it. There's a video of him saying that he, uh, anyone can act presidential. This is very, very recently and a lot of people were watching this going what? But he alSo thinks you need id to buy groceries. Yeah, there's a lot of that. There's. well, he also thinks that stealth bombers are invisible. Yeah, I see that. I can't see them. You're right behind it, asshole. You can look at it.

Speaker 2:          01:33:33       Do you follow a kellyanne conway's husband on twitter? Do you know who he is? George conway. He's a lawyer and he's like, like very vocally anti-trump. It's hilarious. He's constantly subtweeting and like, you know, making fun of trump. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          01:33:49       Interesting. That's going to be fun. Fun household, but what's. This is what gets me go full screen in this gulf. You can't. What's interesting is these dummies behind him. Yeah. Like while this is happening, one of the interesting things about this to me is that his back is to all these people, which is a very odd. Right? So they're all

Speaker 2:          01:34:13       behind him instead of having a static backdrop. You, you're getting to a part of the thing is the other people. It's not just him, it's their reactions. Yeah. It's, it's a sense of belonging to a weird group. Yeah. And everyone has that, like leftist and rightness and whatever. All have this weird belonging. But when it's. Again, it goes back to the China thing, right? Well, we have fox news. We have a way of giving people information that if you follow. I follow fox news on twitter because I want to see what they're telling people. It's a weird thing because it's not like it's all lies, right? There's, there's often lies, they're there, but it's like a very different mixture of things than you would get from

Speaker 1:          01:34:58       the rest of the media and a lot of it is, it's very clear if you, if you follow fox news, like they're, they're targeting an older white, a rural suburban audience. Right. So there's a lot of like weird human interest stories about an alligator popping out of the sewer and things like that, like things that are not there. They have no political agenda, but they're just trying to get those old white people to pay attention. Yeah. Well they're sending a message that the world is kinda scary and weird and you know, we need to protect ourselves and then later on the golf course, they really. Yeah, like they love those stories, right. The alligator, the golf courses is my favorite. It's just local news at 10:00, local news put, you know, a nationwide and edit in there with some cheerleading for this bizarrely dysfunctional administration.

Speaker 1:          01:35:43       Well isn't sean hannity now the number one watch cable news program or something like that? Yeah, I don't know the number. I think it's number one and it's fucking off. They just, they just, there was just a poll. This goes back to the social credit thing. They did a poll. What is the most trusted news source? Um, and fox news gave me number two. What's number one? Bbc. That makes sense. We'll cnn. It's just taken a giant hit because of his constant, constant berating of them. And then you see jim acosta, you know, the whole, these, all these pro wrestling fans like giving them the finger and screaming at him. And it's what I do worry that this is a hard thing to come back from because you know, once you know, one another thing that trump said was that, you know, don't believe anything you're told, right?

Speaker 1:          01:36:34       Unless you hear it from me. And he says the same thing now. Sorry, tucker carlson said the same thing, right? He say that to tucker carlson said like any other shows in this one, don't believe it. Yeah. Look at this. Fuck the media he has on women for trump. It's just. And then after listening to this radio lab podcast about these russian troll farms and about how they implement these things, you got to think, is all of this organic is how many of how much of this is orchestrated? How much of this attacking cnn is orchestrated? It's part of it is part of it is just it builds on itself. All you need is just a little bit of a push. Just talking to someone who is a who is boasting about how hard to Donald Trump works that like compared to previous presidents, he's really just putting in the hours that you could think of that he wakes up, lady watches eight hours of tv every day.

Speaker 1:          01:37:33       He spends all the time at his own resorts, like of all the fantasies you could invent. That's a very weird one. Well, people just love to find narratives of fit. What would be acceptable for their opinions. So this side that they've taken. Exactly right. Yeah. And so he's, you know, he give him credit, he gives people a narrative that works for them. Well, cnn does it too because cnn, they, they spent so little time, uh, going over donner, brazil's book about how the dnc had been corrupted and about how they had rigged the primaries for hillary and really screwed bernie sanders over. This is not a narrative that they dwelled on. They didn't dwell on the fact that she illegally deleted 30 plus thousand emails and said they were about yoga classes. Like that shit is just as preposterous. It's just as. It's just as damning against cnn as some of the nonsense that fox news does.

Speaker 1:          01:38:27       There's no one pure organization of news that's holy object. It's not just as I. I think that fox news is a special, especially damning. I think it talks, I mean fox news was founded by a guy who was a political operative for the republican party, right? Like there might, like individual reporters for most news organizations tend to be liberal, but they also sometimes tend to overcorrect for that. Like to try to bend over backwards to be fair, like way more republicans are quoted in New York times and democrats ever. And I think that there are certainly biases and certainly I'm a misrepresentation of reality from all of these different outlets, but I think fox news is special among the major ones. I would, I would concede that. But I also think that one example of the New York times is different because the New York times, I feel like because of the fact that it's actually writers and it's in text, you're not dealing with people that have to be comfortable performing in front of a camera, which eliminates a large swath of intellectuals.

Speaker 1:          01:39:27       Right. It's a very different medium. It's definitely they fact check and a carnival corrections in a way that the. The tv does not yet. Yeah, it's theater. It's a different thing. And the people like sean hannity that if you read his written word, I don't think he would stand out. No. And I. And again, like I said this before, I worry about what happens next because I don't think that trump will win again. I think you will. All right. I don't think it's entirely possible he'll win again. Yeah, it would be. But again, I didn't think he was going to win the first one she was going to say, don't listen to me. Like before Donald Trump, I was really good at predicting who's going to win elections and I have no ability once he's in the game. So. But I, I worry that the people who sort of are on his side are going to feel even more disenfranchised, disenchanted and angry after he loses again than they do now.

Speaker 1:          01:40:18       And that's, that's gonna be a problem. I think that's a real fear. And I think that one of the reasons why I said it's entirely possible and I don't know if he will win again, but I don't even know if I believe he'll do it again. But I think it's a possibility. And I think that one of the reasons why I think that is I don't see who's the big candidate on the other side. It's opposing him. That stands out right now. Yeah, that's a problem. I think there's a real issue with people not wanting the job. it's a really scary job. You know it, it sucks you dry like a vampire that's hooked up to the back of your neck is just so even with him with his unique ability to sociopathically sort of navigate the waters of accusations and guilt, he still looks beaten down by this job.

Speaker 1:          01:41:07       Yeah, but people want it. Maybe not the people we want to want it. Right. Who sit on the democrat side, who wants it on the left? That stands out. I mean, I think I'm not excited by any of the people right now, but the whole one is. I bet there's going to be 10 people running at least. I mean, I think the biden is at least a 50 percent chance to run. Elizabeth warren's definitely going to run a with warren though. She's got that real problem with the whole pocahontas thing. Well the whole indian thing, that narrative and then what are you going to win? Right. But that, that is a giant problem. The thing that she may have faked whether or not she has native american heritage and she's not willing to take a dna test and there's this native american heritage she claimed is how she got into harvard and she.

Speaker 1:          01:41:52       She used that in order to get special status and that's a problem. You know, whether or not you should forgive someone for something they did a long, long time ago, which I think you probably should. The problem is it's sort of in some ways negates a lot of the good work and things that she said because people say, I can't trust her. She lied about her actual ethnicity. Yeah, it's. But what is hard for me to do is to predict how much it will matter. Right. Like in 2008, we had a race between Vietnam war hero and a black guy. He was middle name was hussein. Right. If you had told me that a few years earlier, who's going to win? I would have gotten that one. We also had sarah pailin, I think. Exactly. This is what we don't know had taken a better running mate. It's entirely possible.

Speaker 1:          01:42:38       Mccain would've been president, I think that people were really tired of george w and I think that um, mccain was just not a good candidate. I think he was gonna lose no matter what. But I think also obama was so charismatic and so uniquely intelligent and smooth and relaxed and statesmen like, I think he, he fit the bill and remember on a depressed, worried about like he went to jeremiah rights church and things like that, right. Stuff that didn't like at the time it was a big deal and you know, who cares eight years later. So I don't know about the pocahontas stuff. That's not, that's a big one though. The pocahontas stuff is a big one because it's a personal lie. I don't know. But again, I mean I think cory booker is going to run camela harris might run, who knows? There's a bunch of people.

Speaker 1:          01:43:22       I would not be at all surprised that joe biden didn't run and I kind of don't think that he should, but he's getting up there and he's in Washington insider, which is not really what the country wants. Right. In 1988 in boston, we used to have joe biden night at the comedy clubs and joe biden night was a night where we would do other people's material because this is when joe biden busted. Yeah, with kennedy's speeches. Yeah. Well, and neil connect the british politician and was when he was running for president in [inaudible] 88. Right. And so we've never done very well running for president. He's won several times. It's so I'm, I think that he was a good vice president to people like him for that and they might not want them to do more than the vice president is a great job. She want no one to pay attention to you.

Speaker 1:          01:44:07       YeAh, exactly. It's like being the, the, you know, the costar and a buddy cop movie with a huge super theory responsibilities. Go to some funerals. Yeah. Easy. Yeah. Unless you're mike pence where you're trying to make it the handmaid's tale behind the scenes. He seems like he's kind of laying back though, like especially over the last few months like that. Trump is so insane that you see very little mike. I don't think you see very little of him, but I think that he's trying his best to put in policies behind the scenes. Well, um, what is this new thing that jeff sessions is trying to push? Religious freedom. Yes. which means you have to obey whatever the fundamentalist christians want to do. Yeah. Well, this is what, you know, michael mouse was tweeting about this the other day when, when he, he, he tweeted this, he said, when I said that aversion of sharia law could very well be coming out of this administration. This is what I'm talking about. Yeah. Yeah. It's a, it's a weird backward thing where you define religious freedom to be let fundamentalist christians do whatever they want. Right? And do it by law.

Speaker 2:          01:45:13       Yeah. Yeah. I mean, and it's, it's tricky because, uh, yeah. I don't know. I mean if someone wants. A part of me is a little bit libertarian when it comes to personal action, like if someone doesn't want to deal with you, that's their right. But when whole groups are being subject systematically to discrimination, like gays are, then the government steps in to protect them a little bit and I think that's okay. And a lot of this is, you know, doctors don't want to do abortions or you know, health care providers, insurance providers don't want to pay for things because of their religious beliefs or, or catholic universities don't want to do certain things. And I think that, uh, these are legitimate questions and we're not really having a grown up intellectual conversation about them. We're just throwing feces at each other. You know, in this particular arena.

Speaker 1:          01:45:59       Well, it's also strange when someone comes up with some sort of a new idea like that, that goes against the separation of church and state and it's being promoted by a guy who's openly religious and says about a bunch of really preposterous things. And you know, generally someone who's not a very trustworthy source of, of intellectual discourse.

Speaker 2:          01:46:23       That's right. And there's this, there's this vaccinating question about why a white depth angelicals or trump's biggest support group like huge track, despite the fact that he is not religious himself, that he's the biggest sinner ever to be in the oval office. Uh, but they love hIm and it's, it's a weird thing. I think a lot of it comes well. So there's, there's sort of the strategic questions. A lot of it comes down to abortion, right? They want supreme court justices will overturn roe v dot wade, that then whoever, however they're going to get that is good for them. But then there's a whole much more elaborate apologetics about how god is using Donald Trump as his instrument to make the country better. Even if he himself is a flawed vessel. Sometimes god works through flAwed vessels.

Speaker 3:          01:47:10       Well, if you position yourself as an ally, even if you have previously send. The beautiful thing about christianity is all you have to do is say, that's not me anymore. I found jesus and I saw a pastor on television going on about that and about even when you're talking about trump, you're talking about the trump before he found jesus and he's like, I don't have a past, and he was like, I am born again. I do not have a past due you, and he was going on about this whole thing about this concept of trump is now an agent of god,

Speaker 2:          01:47:44       but I don't necessarily even think it's christianity. I think that religion can be infinitely malleable to the purposes of the moment. He wouldn't have said that about obama or whoever. Right. You know, you pick and choose when you apply your criteria. Like I, I did this once as an exercise for myself. There's certain phrases in the bible or certain passages in the bible which are sort of unapologetically left wing and socialist, right? Just like there are others that are unapologetically right wing and authoritarian. It's a big book full of different things. So I wondered like how. What did they tell themselves? What do the people who don't fall in that side of the spectrum tell themselves about these passages in the bible? So there's one famous, very famous passage about how it is easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of heaven.

Speaker 2:          01:48:33       Right? Clearly, I think that anyone who reads this says this is an anti rich person statement so you can google it. Like so what do people say about this? So my favorite explanation was that sure, it's impossible for camels to pass through the eyes of a needle, except if jesus helps them or if you grind the camel down to dust and they interpreted this as jesus said, that only through jesus we get into heaven. That's really the only lesson they get. Oh, okay. So that's nothing to do with rick. all you have to do is find jesus. And if you're rich, you're good. Well, this is my time. This is why I can't. Even though I'm an atheist, I'm, I'm, I'm very happy to explain why I don't think that god exists, but I don't blame religion most of the time for people's bad actions because I think that religion is just sort of a catalyst lets people find excuses for their bad actions, but it's usually the bad actions, the desire to do bad actions that comes first.

Speaker 3:          01:49:32       Do you ever look at religion as a potential almost evolutionary software program that's allowed people to sort of adopt morality and impose certain standards of behavior that are conducive to.

Speaker 2:          01:49:48       So people talk about that. And again, I'm not an expert there. I a little skeptical because it sounds like too much of a story to tell after the fact. Right? I think that we are a little bit quick to attribute ideas and cultural concepts to evolution. Um, but certainly, you know, religion was not like just science done badly back in the day, right? Like what religion was, was something much more expansive inter, inter leafed with your life overall. So it was not just how the world was created and whether god exists. It was how to be a good person, how to live in your community, things like that. And you know, disentangling these things is one of the reasons why religion is still hanging around, right? Like even after the kind of underpinnings of the religion in terms of understanding how the world works had been removed by science.

Speaker 2:          01:50:40       The other functions are still there and I, I'm a big critic of my fellow naturalists who have not put enough effort into replacing the other functions of religion. Now that the, uh, the, the claims about the world are no longer viable. That's a great way to present it. Yeah. And it's, it's really a problem when there's so many versions. Yeah. So, I mean, one of the many, many reasons why I think that it's not really credible to be religious intellectually is because if in the classic traditional western religious sense where there's a god and he cares about us, right? So there's all sorts of questions about where we define the boundary of religion, whether buddhism is a religion or something like that. But in the usual sense that we, that we grew up with in this country, I'm surely if that were true, god would have done a much better job of explaining himself to us.

Speaker 2:          01:51:37       Right? Like why would god give us his message through a bunch of people in a tiny country who didn't write? You know, like the new testament wasn't written down until decades after the event. None of the people who wrote it down were eye witnesses. Why is it only shared there? I mean, god, it's god is god. Right? Like he could easily have showed up. Everybody in the world talk to them and explain how things were going and let them make their own choices. That would have been a much more efficient way of getting the message out. And so it's just not really sensible to think that. So if god didn't exist, then what you would imagine is that in different countries, in different parts of the world, in different periods in history, people would tell their own stories and they'd all be a little bit different and they'd be adaptive there, local circumstances, and they'd be utterly incompatible with each other.

Speaker 2:          01:52:20       And that's exactly what you find. Do you speculate as to what the origins of the concept of god are since so many different groups of people all over the world have a very similar idea, at least that there's some omnipotent superpower that's controlling the destiny of everything? Yeah. So number one, I think that the idea of omnipotence was actually somewhat late coming onto the scene, right? Like if you dig into, uh, what was happening before 2000 years ago, um, you know, the hebrew god was not omnipotent at the beginning, right? I mean, the hebrews came out of a polytheistic society where there were lots of different gods around and you can trace how their god evolved over time and first, you know, became their god, right? Like there was one god that the, that the hebrews were, uh, you know, a worshiping and the egyptians and the babylonians and worship other gods.

Speaker 2:          01:53:14       Then they started saying, well, our god is better than all the other ones. And then they started saying, well, the other ones don't even exist. Right? And it was an evolution over time and omnipotence came late, like you would talk about the gods quarreling if you were a polytheistic pagan culture. It's actually makes more like a lot of the world makes more sense if you believe there's a whole bunch of gods out there who disagree with each other, right? Suddenly lots of aspects of realities come into focus. But the idea, there's supernatural, very powerful influences in the. I mean, that's just an obvious idea. I think like we're human beings, we tend to, as our first guest and understanding the world, treat the world as, you know, humanists, like we're, we're, we're anthropomorphic, right? Like, if something exists, it must have been designed. There must be a reason, there must be a purpose.

Speaker 2:          01:54:02       Uh, things work in a certain way because someone made them that way and that we don't see that person hanging around, so it must be, you know, up there in the sky or something. I don't think it's that hard to imagine that all sorts of different cultures would evolve. Do you think it's also a function of us growing up with mentors and father figures and leaders and chieftains and there's always someone who is the big, the big kahuna. So this is the sky daddy. Yeah. Sky daddy overlooks the big picture. I think there's that. And also the idea of your ancestors and ancestor worship or veneration. Right. Which is also very almost universal, you know, in, in primitive cultures, I'm like, you don't want to admit you died. Right. That's a sad thing to sit through. So I don't know. I'm sure they're real experts who know a lot about the actual origins of these things, but, but my point is just that I don't take the commonalities between different sets of religious beliefs as evidence for anything other than there's a very human thing to invent.

Speaker 2:          01:55:00       People search for meaning and they take meaning from what or whatever religion or ideology that they subscribe to and they use it as a sort of a reason why they're living. It gives them hope. It gives them, gives them something. Yeah. It's a very common theme among religious thinkers that if it weren't for the existence of god or whatever, there'd be no reason to live. There'd be no reason to be a good person and so forth. And you know, I think it's a, it goes back to the motivation we have as having bodies versus being in a computer. Like there's plenty of reasons to do different things. Like in, in the big picture. My last book, I talk a lot about, um, you know, we, we, it's okay to admit that we as human beings have desires that we, there are things we care about, that we want to be true.

Speaker 2:          01:55:53       And you can talk about why that's true from evolution, from biology and whatever, but it doesn't matter why in some sense we have goals. We are not completely aimless. Like we want to survive. We want to flourish. We want to be friends with people, we want to have families or whatever it is we want to do all that we put together in terms of morality and ethics and meaning and purpose comes out of thinking hard and carefully, hopefully about, uh, how to systematize and grow those existing desires that we have into a way of living in the world. We don't need anything external to make that happen. We just need to sort of think about where we are already and try to make it better.

Speaker 3:          01:56:33       But you as an intelligent person who's also an atheist who thinks very deeply about things, what do you cling to as a purpose for life? Do you have one to have like, uh, when you sit and think like, what's the point of all this? Do you, do you.

Speaker 2:          01:56:53       I don't have a single one. I don't have a monolithic purpose. I have plenty of intermediate sized purposes, right? Um, otherwise, you know, why continue living? I think that, uh, there's plenty of things I want to do to achieve, to experience, to share, to give to the world, right? That's big

Speaker 3:          01:57:09       feature, right? They give to the world that you're your inner ear, the way you interact with other human beings and your effect on other human beings gives you a, gives you purpose.

Speaker 2:          01:57:19       Yeah. And even if I think that when I die, I will no longer exist in my feelings, won't matter. I have feelings right now about what the world would be like even after I'm not here anymore. Right. So I can still be motivated to make the world a better place in ways that will outlive me. Even if I think that when I die, it's really the end for me.

Speaker 3:          01:57:37       Hm. And do you get down sometimes? Do you ever do, do you get like these periods of like, you're like, what is the purpose of all this? Especially if you see some ridiculous thing in the news or some horrific tragedy. And I'm

Speaker 2:          01:57:55       pretty, I mean, so for horrific tragedies. No, I'm, I'm, I'm just, you know, fortunate enough to be a pretty even keeled when it comes to that stuff I don't have, I don't struggle with depression or despair or existential anxiety or anything like that. Uh, when I was a kid, when I was first starting thinking about the universe and science and things like that, I would start wondering about, well, what if the universe hadn't existed at all? What if I weren't, wasn't here, uh, and that may be loose sleep that night. And I think like many people there, there was a very definite moment when I realized that I and everyone I knew would die, right? and that, so I woke up crying and my mom had to, you know, a comfort me because like, I was like, you know, grand mom's gonna die and you're going to die and I'm going to die.

Speaker 2:          01:58:42       And you know, yeah. But, you know, as a grownup, no, I think that, uh, you know, I'm more or less. So once again, one of the future podcast guests that, uh, I'll be a next week's podcast will be by a woman who was part of the death positive movement. Have you heard about this? Yeah, this is real stuff. What, who, so don't distinguish, don't, don't confuse it. There is a whole movement, like an anti natal this movie or something like that. Forget what they call themselves, but there's a whole movement that wants human beings not to exist. That's crazy, but there are people who like that the death positive movement is the following, like we're going to die. We should face up to it, we should accept it and we should deal with it in a personally and culturally positive way. So for example, like right now, especially in the United States, even compared to europe or other countries, we're terrible at dealing with death.

Speaker 2:          01:59:36       We put people in hospitals, we take them away from their families, away from their homes. We refuse to admit that they're going to die. So we treat it as if the whole purpose of the game is to squeeze out as many more hours of life as possible, no matter what, the quality of that life is, um, and all that is just rubbish. And we should be much more grown up about it. We should plan ahead. You know, when, uh, obama suggested that in the healthcare system, there should be some planning for what happens when you die. Sarah pailin came along with death panels and that was a very effective rhetorical strategy. We don't want to think about the fact that we're going to die. We don't want to plan for it. If we did plan for it, it could be better. We could die at home, we could die with less pain, we might not live as long as we don't like do every single medical intervention possible just to squeeze out a few more breaths. But it could be a much more life affirming experience to die because the people around us who, who are there, uh, come across with an acceptance of what's going on rather than the feeling that we should just do everything we can to prevent.

Speaker 3:          02:00:44       I had a similar situation happened recently with a dog of mine who was a massive, reached 13 years old and from massive. So it's very old and we had to put him down because he couldn't walk anymore. And uh, he was, it was brutally painful to watch him try to get up and fall down and, you know, um, but one of the things I was thinking was that if this is my grandfather and not my dog, I would have to watch him suffer until the bitter end. Yeah. I knew this dog wasn't going to go backwards in time and become a puppy again. Right. And knew his days were numbered. He couldn't do anything. Most days he just slept all day until it was time to eat. But it was getting to the point where I had to carry him to his food. Yeah. And I knew that

Speaker 2:          02:01:34       there's no quality of life, right? No quality of life. ANd it's, in some sense it's even harder with the dog because you can't talk them. Right. You can't explain to them what's going on. They can't explain to you what their wishes are. So you have to be the responsible one. But yeah. So everything legally and culturally in the United States is we're not allowed to relieve that pain or that, that despair that you have in the end of your life. Some states, including California, are passing death with dignity laws where basically it's what used to be called assisted suicide, but we don't call it that anymore. I'm a you. A doctor is allowed to give you the means to end your own life when you're. When you're near, you have to be near a point of no return, but still clearly thinking enough to be able to make that decision

Speaker 3:          02:02:15       for yourself and there's also an issue with our real concern is their fear and their this, this experience being this terrifying sort of step into the great beyond and there's a tool to mitigate that and the tool that has been shown to mitigate that as psychedelics. One of the big ones being psilocybin. Psilocybin has a remarkable effect on people that are going through stage four cancer and a johns hopkins is studied it. There's, there's, there's quite a few studies that have shown that people, when you give them psilocybin, they they're much more relaxed and much more comfortable with this idea of ending this life of this life. You know, it's gone through its course and get this. It's an inevitable thing and it's really our biological limitations that are terrified and sparking up all of these intense primal fears of the end.

Speaker 2:          02:03:20       YeAh. I'm actually a 100 percent in agreement there. My wife jennifer will lead to is a science writer, wrote a book called me and myself and why searching for the science of self and uh, one of our friends said, oh, if you're gonna write a book about the self, you got to do lsd. And so we did and she researched it. And uh, it's a fascinating history, right? And, uh, eldest huxley, I don't know if you know about how this whole story and he took lsd to do exactly this. He had throat cancer and it completely helped you. It's never fun to die, right? But it absolutely helped ease that journey in a very simple way, but just as we are a sort of immature society that doesn't want to face up to the reality of our eventual deaths were also very culturally conservative and squeamish about drugs. Right. And so were. We don't even let people do research on some of these drugs. and so I think that, yeah, we have a lot of growing up to do when it comes to, uh, not just living a good life, but also having a good death and also so

Speaker 3:          02:04:20       paying attention to actual scientists who have studied these compounds and really understand what the effects of them are and have researched them deeply and have personal experiences with them and they're saying these, the, these things have been demonized and there are tools that we can use

Speaker 1:          02:04:38       to sort of mitigate a lot of the real issues that we have, whether it's culturally or personally with these transitionary times, like death is inevitable. So now that we know it's inevitable, you tell me what the main problem would be with someone taking psilocybin before they die and letting them ease their way through this. But you know, it's the same reaction that doesn't want people to have a basic income, right? There is a sort of moral feeling that you're weak. You don't struggle against dad everything. And it's silly, right? It's no sense, but it's very, very common. It's so weird that, that, that the universal basic income topic is one of those knee jerk reaction or topics that I, myself, my friend eddie wong, have introduced it to me for the first time and I, my initial knee jerk reaction was, ah, you can't do that to people.

Speaker 1:          02:05:29       Human nature, people are going to get lazy. And then the more I thought about it, I was like, well, if you just cover their food and their rent, are they really going to get, is it really going to kill their ambition? Like why would that kill it? Is our own ambition, our ambition uniquely tied to just survival. That doesn't make sense. Well, and it's a weird. It's the same weird thing that people use against, you know, having a progressive tax system. Like if we have, we tax people's money, they won't want to work anymore, but you know, if you know, you still want more money, we don't them so much that you have less money to work. That's not how it works. And I think like what, so but, but also for the, for the universal basic income stuff, I think people have to reconcile themselves.

Speaker 1:          02:06:11       So what if someone wants to just sit around and play video games all day, brian, is that the worst thing in the world? Like, I mean, I think that there will be people like that. There will still be other people who want to write poetry and build sailboats and you know, build a spacecraft, et cetera, or build artificial intelligence. And you wouldn't. What if everyone could do whatever they want when they were kids when they're 10 years old, they were, they were taught a good programming language and could, you know, make up whatever apps and programs they wanted. Like there'll be a whole different world than what we live in right now. And it might be very exciting. Well, creatively it could possibly expand a lot of people's potentials, right? Where they no longer have to have a job. So they could do whatever this one thing is that they're thinking about doing.

Speaker 1:          02:06:55       Write a book or a screenplay, develop something in the short term. I don't know if a basic income work sort of economically, but I think that if we believe that there's more and more stuff that can be done by computers, by robots or whatever automation, then it's absolutely something that should be taken seriously. Yeah. So I think that this is the whole thing, and this is great because we've been talking a lot of different angles about the fact that the shape of the world is changing in a way that makes what it means to be human changing and, uh, facing up to what those changes are, the fact that we died, in fact, we make up purpose and meaning for ourselves and in our lives and the fact that what we are physically in terms

Speaker 2:          02:07:36       of bodies and, and machines and so forth is Also changing. So in this part of the theme of my podcast, I hope is that, uh, to think through some of these issues to sort of. I don't know the answers, but I want to ask the questions about, you know, who we are, what we're living, what should we be doing about it? Because god's not going to give us the answer. Well, I think

Speaker 3:          02:07:54       podcasts like yours and I mean any podcasts where people are really carefully considering issues there, I think what's important about them that really didn't exist before is that someone can sort of digest these very complex subjects through to people having a conversation about it that perhaps are more informed and have more data and have more experience and have more thought about these particular issues. So what you can do and what sam harris can do in a lot of people can do that are creating these podcasts about these really complex issues, is you start that conversation and this seed gets planted into someone's head and maybe they carry with them at work. They carry with them, carry it with them when they're on the subway or during the commute home, and then they become a part of the broader conversation that we have as a couple.

Speaker 2:          02:08:48       Exactly. Yeah, and that'S why I sort of want to not draw a distinction between science and other ways of thinking deeply about the world. Because I want people to. You know, I. I've often said this as a joke, I want to live in a world where people work hard in the factory and they go out for a drink afterwards and talk about their favorite interpretation of quantum mechanics. Right. I want that to be the kind of thing people are bullshitting about, you know, over beer. That'd be a world I want to live in is that. Have you ever run into a quantum mechanics conversation at a bar? There are far too many people who think they understand something about quantum mechanics and are going to explain it to me. So I'm at the existing conversations to be a little bit more informed. Yeah. Well it's. There's a few people online.

Speaker 3:          02:09:31       Someone has. You got to get this guy on and then I've listened to them talk and I'm like, I'm pretty sure

Speaker 2:          02:09:37       that that guy's full of shit, but I can't really point out how I know that a lot of crack, but feel free to email me. I will help you out if a. Well, I don't want to bring this one guy up on, but I'll talk to you about it the year. Yeah, there's a lot of woo out there, but also it's quantum mechanics, a lot of very respectable people who sound crazy if you don't know too deeply what they're, what they're saying. So that is the fineman quote, right? If you think, you know quantum mechanics, you definitely don't know quantum mechanics exactly. Which is the whole point of my book is to overcome that feeling because I think what happened is, you know, it's true that we don't agree. We physicists don't agree in what quantum mechanics says, but we now fetishize the fact that we don't understand it.

Speaker 2:          02:10:16       Like it's good that we don't understand it. Like if you try to understand it too hard, you're wasting your time. And I, I so disagree with that view. So I think the quantum mechanics is and should be understandable by everybody. What a squirrely concept. It's, it's. Yeah. Yeah. It's weird and that's why I'm a lot of people. There's a lot of people who I know who friends of mine who are professors in philosophy departments because they got a phd in physics and they realized what they really wanted to do was to think about quantum mechanics in a deep way and they would never get a job in a physics department doing that to put philosophy would let them do it. Oh wow. Yeah. Interesting. And what they're really doing is physics, but they're doing it in a way that philosophers are happy with and physicists.

Speaker 2:          02:11:00       And what year did the concept of quantum mechanics become invented? Invented in test. And it started in 1900. Exactly, but they sort of perfected the modern version around 19, 27. What was the original thought process, do you know? Yeah, it's a. It was the. The history is amazing and a messy because they didn't have so much weirdness going on. It was max plunk plunk radiation if you ever heard of that. No, I'm a german physicist. So black body radiation, something glows when you heat it up. Right? So basically what happens when you heat something up is all the atoms and molecules start vibrating. There's a lot of charged particles. A charged particle has an electric field around it, and if you vibrate it, the electric field starts vibrating. We call that light or radiation, right? Gravity. Electromagnetic waves are being admitted. So you could in the year 1900, you could sit down and do a calculation.

Speaker 2:          02:12:00       What should that look like? You know, if you heed everything up, how much radiation should it give off? And there the problem was it should give off an infant amount of radiation at very long wavelength, which is obviously false, right? Because obviously not how things really work. So there was this blatant disagreement between everything we thought we knew. And then in the late 19th century, in the 18 hundreds, people really thought in physics that they were close to the answer, right? They had a picture where there were particles like electrons and protons. And then there were fields like the electromagnetic field and the gravitational field. And the particles were matter and the fields push them together. They interacted, they, you know, they were the forces, right. And this picture was so good and so compelling that people were basically like, we're almost done with physics, right?

Speaker 2:          02:12:47       We almost have it all figured out. And then there were a couple of little things like the black body radiation that you made a prediction. It was wildly off. And so they're like, well, what's going to happen? So plonk says, well maybe when this electromagnetic radiation is admitted, it's not just a continual stream of radiation. Maybe if like individual little packets of energy, he had no reason to say that. Like it's just out of the blue is just pulled out of his butt. Right. So he was just sitting there with a pad. Yeah, just contemplate and think what if. And he goes, what if he gets exactly the right answer? Right? The data. Right. And he said, there it is. And he's like, he public and he, he himself wasn't sure what to make of this. He's like, I got this idea. It gives the right answer.

Speaker 2:          02:13:30       Who knows? That is crazy. And it was five years later, young man named albert einstein said, well, I know what's going on. Those little packets of energy or themselves, particles, that light is not a wave. There's particles that are being given off photons, would they relate, are called right? And that's what he won the nobel prize for it. I just, I never won a nobel prize for relativity. He won the nobel prize for inventing photons basically. And then, uh, so there was that. So that was, there were two tracks going on. Remember I just said in the 19th century, it was the world's made of particles and fields. So the first thing that happened is people started thinking about these fields, electromagnetic field. And einstein saYs, well, there's something a little bit particle like about it, right? Is not a hardened from distinction. Then separately, they looked at adam's right?

Speaker 2:          02:14:17       So you have a electron orbiting and adam orbiting the nucleus of an atom. You have this picture that everyone has seen the cartoon of an atom, right? with the electron orbiting around. Again, you can make a prediction. That electron moving around the nucleus of anatomies should be giving off light. It's a moving electron when you, when you accelerate and electronic gives off light, so it should lose energy and spiral into the middle. It should not just stay in the same orbit. It should be losing energy by radiating energy away. You can. You can calculate for a typical adam, how long should it take before the adam shrinks to zero size and the answer is like a hundred billion to of a second. So all the atoms that you and I are made of should just go right away. Rapper that break, give off light and squint. Scrunch down to zero size.

Speaker 2:          02:15:01       That's a problem, right? That's, that's not compatible with the data. So niels bohr in 1913 ish comes along and says, I have an idea. What if the electrons don't do that? Because they can't. What if there's certain orbits that they're allowed to have and they're not allowed to have any other ones? Again, just pulled out of nowhere for no good reason, but he says, if that's true, I predict the following, you know, spectrum of radiation from hydrogen. You know, look it up, it's exactly right, fits the data, perfect jesus and people like what the hell is going on? and then it was. So that took like another 10, 15 years before people like heisenberg and schrodinger built that up into saying it's not just that waves of light have a certain particle illness. It's also that particles like electrons have a certain waviness and there's a wave function and they're getting in quantum mechanics and we're still arguing about it to this day.

Speaker 2:          02:15:54       Well, it's such a difficult concept to wrap your head around that. It's been distorted, right? It's like, especially in the womb merchants. I have a, a fun part of my book. I list like 20 titles that came up in amazon. When you type the word quantum in quantum love, quantum power, quantum yoga, quantum healing, quantum politics, quantum theology, you know, it's used for every crazy bit of nonsense that you've ever heard of. How do you mitigate that? Write more books, have more podcasts, keep talking, right? Like you know, you'll never get rid of it entirely there. As you may have heard, there are people who still believe the earth is flat. Oh, I haven't heard, so you're never going to completely get rid of the wrong ideas, but you can get the right ideas out there more effectively.

Speaker 3:          02:16:40       Yeah. Do you think that it's possible that. I mean this concept was created and invented somewhere around the 19 hundreds. Is it possible that another theory that's just as revolutionary is being developed right now and through things like the large hadron collider and search for understanding the elementary particles of the universe, is it possible that we could develop a new theory and are there any that are being contemplated right now,

Speaker 2:          02:17:11       so it's absolutely possible that what einstein and tried his best to do right? He thought that he could do better than quantum mechanics and he did not succeed. The big difference is that when real quantum mechanics was developed between 1,990, 27 at every step, it was because there was some dramatic disagreement between the theory and the data and right now our theories are good enough that they fit the data really, really well. So we're trying to make, I'm, I and others are proposIng new ideas to try to understand, you know, how spacetime emerges in quantum mechanics and things like that and you can try to do better than quantum mechanics, but it's all just on pure principle, right on pure, like coherence and beauty and elegance because we have a theory that fits the data fine. And it's so much harder to make progress when you're trying to do it in your brain rather than doing it by data.

Speaker 3:          02:18:04       Hmm. So as for right now, there's nothing else being contemplated that.

Speaker 2:          02:18:10       No, that's pretty unique. Is being contemplated. Nothing promising. Nothing. Nothing, nothing emergent. Like there are people who think they can do better. There is no one who agrees that someone else is doing better right now. Right. Are there any standout theories that people have sort of, I think replacing quantum mechanics or even improving quantum mechanics is because there's no guidance whatsoever from experiments. Um, there's not even a sort of leading thing. In fact, I don't think it's the right way to go. I think that given right now, given the fact that we have quantum mechanics and yet don't quite understand it, our job should be to understand what we got,

Speaker 3:          02:18:48       what, what, what has come out of the large hadron collider. I know that they, there was some discussion as to whether or not they found the higgs boson or boston. I say bows on, but pose on was with a z. It's pronounced with [inaudible], but it's spelled with a dance boo son. Oh, it is. It's pronounced [inaudible]. I only read it. I never had a physicist a bose on, on. Yep. Okay. So the higgs boson there, there was some discussion that they had absolutely proven its existence, but then there was also some debate about that. So it's actually a very bittersweet. The large hadron

Speaker 2:          02:19:28       collider. Bittersweet. Well, yeah. Life doesn't promise you a rose garden. Uh, we found the higgs boson fairly quickly after getting the large hadron collider up to speed. We founded in 2012. You can read that in my other book, the particle at the end of the universe. Um, but we didn't find anything else. So did we find the higgs boson? Yes, it is crystal clear that we found a particle and that particle is exactly what we predicted 40 years before that the higgs boson would look like it talks to the other particles in the same way it has the right mass and has the same lifetime and all those things. But there is a puzzle. So this is what we have. We don't have blatant disagreement between theory and experiment. Well, we have our puzzles, right? Well, we have our mismatches between our informal expectation and what reality is doing.

Speaker 2:          02:20:16       So in one way, uh, so there's a number which is the mass of the higgs bozon. We measured it. Okay. One hundred and 30 some times the mass of a proton. But there's a guess as to what the mass should have been if, if nature. We're natural nature is natural, but if our notion of nature have worked out the way it was, what should the mass of the higgs bows on? B. And it's literally a quadrillion times bigger than what it actually does. What's a quadrillion tended to 15. Oh, okay. Yeah. That's what I'm not making this up. You can google this. Uh, the mass of the higgs boson should be enormously bigger by sort of what our intuitive feelings about quantum mechanics and quantum field theory say. So there's a known problem, has been known for a long time called the hierarchy problem. And so even before we discovered the higgs, we knew it wasn't that heavy.

Speaker 2:          02:21:04       We knew as much, much lighter than what it should be. So the hierarchy problem was a known thing and people said, how could it be true? Well, you have to change the theory a little bit. You have to like add some new particles or predict some new features, a physics going on. And many, many people, myself included, we're very optimistic that the large hadron collider would find evidence for what was going on, would find more particles than just the higgs bozon. It's found nothing else maybe would find supersymmetry or extra dimensions or strings or some new kinds of combinations of old particles. It's found nothing else. So now we have a puzzle and no answers. Right. And that's, that's the most frustrating thing because they're the. I mean, people don't want to say this out loud, but here we go. Since no one's listening to this, right, um, the last time particle physicists were surprised by an experimental result from a particle accelerator was in the 19 seventies.

Speaker 2:          02:22:00       Since then we found new particles, but they were already predicted and expected to be there. We've never found a particle since the seventies that no one had anticipated finding long before. Well, just the idea of a particle collider as a lay person, as a person just looking on the outside, like you got to create crashes. Yet like that's the only way to find out what's going on with the, the basic building blocks of the universe. You have to rush things and knew each other. I know. Yeah. Well, so the secret to that is that really the world is not made of particles. It's really made a fields, right? That's quantum field theories. The laBel given to this. So for the electromagnetic field, for the light coming out of the light bulbs, that makes sense. We figured out the fields first and I'll leave down the particles later.

Speaker 2:          02:22:44       But it's also true, as we were just talking about, for the particles like electrons, protons, quirks, neutrinos. These are all vibrations and fields. So what do you should think about when you think of colliding particles? It's not little pea shaped things that are bumping into each other and smushing, right? It's really like a little vibration into fields that are coming into the same place and overlapping and all the particles that could potentially exist are fields that are out there in the world and usually they're just quietly sitting there not doing anything. But when these particles that you made in the large hadron collider hitting each other, that sets up vibrations in every field in the universe, like very faint little jiggles up and down, and then you look and you see in quantum mechanics says there's a probability will look one way versus another. So the way you make it how in the world you make a higgs boson by colliding protons, even though the higgs boson is over a hundred times heavier than a proton, right?

Speaker 2:          02:23:38       The answer is really. You're setting up vibrations and the higgs field, which was always there all along, and then you very quickly actually you can't. The higgs, the higgs boson disappears so quickly. You'll never see it. You see what it decays into, you see what it converts into. The vibrations and the higgs field get transferred to vibrations and other things and that's what we observe in our detector. So if you, if you are able to do this sort of conceptual switched from particles to fields than the reason why we need an accelerator and a collider to make new particles begins to make a bit more sense, doesn't it? Don't you? Oh, I get it now. There was something that I had read. I'm trying one more thing. like if you're in a room with two pianos and you play one piano, the piano will start vibrating along with it a little bit.

Speaker 2:          02:24:24       Ah, that's an interesting way to look at it. That's the one field, the quarks and gluons and the proton start the higgs field vibrating a little bit and that's what we eventually see. I'm glad you mentioned glue on's. Um, that's one of the things that I had read about that they did, they had either discovered or were able to observe with the large hadron collider was a believer. It's called quark glue on plasma. Right. You got it right. Thank you. Um, which is an immensely dense thing that the, the way they described it was something like something that was a fraction of the size of a sugar cube would weigh as much as the earth itself. Yeah, that's right. So usually what you try to do with particle accelerators is discovered new particles. Right? So to do that, why haven't you discovered them already? Usually it's because they're too heavy.

Speaker 2:          02:25:13       It takes energy to make them equals mc squared. If their mass is big and a lot of energy in as smallest possible region. That's how you make new particles. So to do that, you take some particles that are pretty small, like protons and you smash them together. And that's how we discovered the higgs and we're looking for other things. But maybe your goal in life is not to discover new particles, but to understand the particles that we already know about, right? In that case, maybe you want to see what happens when you get, like you say, a huge number of particles together in the same place with a lot of energy and see how they interact with each other and make a plasma. Plasma is like what's at the center of the sun, right? But instead of electrons and photons, we're going to make it a quarks and gluons.

Speaker 2:          02:25:55       So instead of smashing together protons approach on has three corks each, right? we smashed together the nucleus of a heavy adam like an iron or lead adam, right? Which has, you know, dozens of, of protons and neutrons in it. So we get as many particles as we can squeeze together in the same place. So the energy is a bit more diffuse, but we get to study how they interact with each other because that's what conditions were like near the big bang. Lots of particles going on. It wasn't just two particles smacking into each other. So we're learning a lot about what conditions were like in the very, very early universe. What is the mass of this stuff? This core gluon plasma, like there's some insane number that uh, I remember reading, yes. But by neural implant is failing me, so it's not remember the number right now, but we could google it.

Speaker 2:          02:26:43       It's very dense, gigantic, massive. If it's a bit of a cheat, right? Like, you know, so I always, I get laughed when I give talks on the higgs boson because uh, I mentioned that the hate, the lifetime of the higgs bozon already said it disappears very quickly. Right. So I say it's one zeptosecond, which is true. That's just like, you know, you when I say quadrillion, you're like, what does that number? And I said 10 and 15, but who cares? What's the point of a zeptosecond really short. So I say it's a zeptosecond, which is a really short period of time and everyone laughs it's 10 to the minus 21 seconds. But who cares if I said 10 to the minus 28, would that have changed your opinion at the expose on, in any way? Like it's a really short period of time, right? Like five quadrillion.

Speaker 2:          02:27:25       Is that more than a trillion? Yeah. It doesn't really affect your life in any meaningful way. What is going on right now with, with science that is particularly compelling to you? Other than things we've already discussed? You know, I'm very interested in entropy and complexity, complex systems. Um, there's a wonderful place in New Mexico in santa fe just called the santa fe institute, which is devoted to the study of complex systems. Physicists are really, really good at studying simple systems, a couple of articles at a time, right? And there's certain techniques they have this, this is why we have theories that explain all the data because we're asking questions about the simplest possible things that we can. Once you have a bacterium or a, an elephant or an economic system or an internet, these are very, very complex systems with many moving parts, interact with each other and complicated ways.

Speaker 2:          02:28:20       And so you can start asking yourself questions about are there laws that govern the behavior of these complex systems that we wouldn't have noticed if we just studied them piece by piece? And the answer is a little bit yes, he to keep advertising my podcast. But we had Jeffrey West on the podcast. Who is hate it. I, yeah, I shouldn't hate it. That's the whole reason. Like I'm not actually telling you the truth, but saw through me there. I love advertising my podcast. I had Jeffrey West who's a brilliant physicist who actually started as a particle physicist and then when we were going to have, you remember, we were going to build the superconducting super collider in the United States. This was going to be our version of the lhc large hadron collider. But the ssc would have been both sooner and better. It would have been higher energy administration, correct?

Speaker 2:          02:29:09       That's right. And uh, well it started during the reagan administration and then clinton let it be killed by congress. Uh, so Jeffrey West, who was a particle physics at the time said like, it's my life's work. I was hoping for this to come online and I'm not going to see what, what else can I do? And he, he found that in biology there are what is known as scaling laws. So if you look at different organisms like mammals or whatever, right, you can plot different quantities like their mass and their metabolism or their lifespan and things like that. And it turns out that they are related to each other. It's not, you know, if you know how heavy a mammal is, you know how long it's going to live, you can figure that out. Um, and in fact it's related to the metabolism also. So there's a wonderful. So basically the bigger you are, the longer you live. also, the bigger you are, the slower your heartbeats and they exactly cancel out so that every mammal lives for about one and a half billion heartbeats on.

Speaker 3:          02:30:07       I've read that and I relayed that to my friends that are runners and I was like, you gotta think if you're an ultra marathon runner, look, my friend cameron hanes, he runs these 240 mile runs this. He just did that in death valleY and the bad. What I keep saying that ass, but it's like the bed. Water. Yeah. Thirty five mileS. These are crazy. So you gotta think like exertion over long periods. You tell them you're juicing up your battery. You don't get a finite number, a fixed number of heartbeats to begin with, but you know what they do do though? It lowers their resting heart rate, which is fascinating. That's right. So all this extreme exercise, oh, you're wasting heartbeats, but also your heartbeat is probably like 78. Whereas there's this 34, now they're winning overall it totally compensates weird, right? It's a weird sort of intuitive thing. It's

Speaker 2:          02:31:02       100 billion and a half is just an average. But the point is, so Jeffrey West and his collaborator. So why? Why is it that you know, you can't make an animal that's twice as big and lives the same blank. Yeah. What? What's, what's going on? So they actually came up with a theory based on the fact that our bodies are right, our circulatory system or respiratory system, our nervous system, and they all have the same structure like trees, right? Like fractals and, and they were able to show that if, if our, if the resources that our biology uses travel through these fractal networks in a three dimensional space, right? The weird three dimensional beings, then you get these scaling laws, you get the this universal behavior and fits the data and now you know, you can extend it to the behavior of things like cities and corporations and stuff like that.

Speaker 2:          02:31:52       So when you get people in a city, they walk faster, right? Like people in little small towns mosey down the street and everyone in the big city walks faster. And why is that? Like, what's going on? And there's, you, you would not be surprised to learn that there are more patents, uh, that are generated in a big city than this small town. But there are even more patents per person in a big city. Like living in that dense environment changes the rate of innovation and things like that. So they're studying how we can try to extract these, not quite as precise as particle physics, but still very general robust relationships between these large systems and learn from that, how to make things more sustainable, more creative, more innovative, more livable and things like that. So I think all this stuff is very fast.

Speaker 3:          02:32:45       They've actually done studies where they've put cameras up on streets and they watch people walk by and the amount of footsteps they take per minute, they can accurately depict or they can accurately predict how many people live in that city. I believe that. That's cool. Yeah. Just based on how and also how fast you talk.

Speaker 2:          02:33:06       Yep. How fast you talk. Um, uh, how fast the line moves in the dmv office in, I think it's dublin. I'm not exactly sure but, but Jeffrey West has this picture of dublin. There's this tourist area. And so it's both a big city where a lot of people live, but it's also a famous tourist destination. We're foreigners come in and wander around. Right. And the locals who live in a big city and want to get where they want to go became so frustrated with all these moseying tourists. They literally made walking lanes for the locals where you have to walk
