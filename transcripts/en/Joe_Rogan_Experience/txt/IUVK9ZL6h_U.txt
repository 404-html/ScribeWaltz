Speaker 1:          00:00:00       It's, I don't know, we're not really on youtube, but we're on ustream right now. Bitches are we on? We're on right now. The Joe Rogan experience podcast is brought to you by the fleshlight. If you go to Joe Rogan.net and click on the link for the flashlight, you get 15 percent of the number one sex toy for men. Also want to thank Joel servers, jolt servers of the ones who are hosting us. That's Jason's company. And uh, he's a cool motherfucker. Got a good friend of mine and uh, also on it.com. Makers of Alpha brain. And uh, if you go to Joe Rogan.net, or if you go to Alpha brain, whatever, if you go to [inaudible] dot com as we gotta do. Oh and it o n n I t put in my name Joe Rogan or grow. Just put. Rogan says, listen to this dude, I don't really know what the fuck I'm saying. You forgot to take Alpha brain today. Didn't you know the three of them right before the show? They just haven't kicked in yet. I wonder now, we just, we just smoked way too much weed. Here we go. The Joe Rogan experience.

Speaker 1:          00:01:07       We just mixed a bunch of Shit, man. We mixed some shit called moon rocks and with some other stuff. Was Moon rock sativa or was that also. There's an Oji indigo Jesus. A deep couch lock weed. And then we mixed it in with that other stuff. No, no. Susko Hannah today. You brought up the big. I had to get around. We didn't bring out that orange where that blueberry orange from 2005 and not fucking right. I got it right away. It was the best shit back in 2005. It was, it was before train wreck when I first started buying weed before we had a, um, before we had licenses, I would always buy mass quantities because I didn't want to have to deal with those dudes, but I always had just laying around. Dude, it was incredible. It's a funny subject. This marijuana and there's a lot of controversy behind it and I'm not given in.

Speaker 1:          00:02:02       I'm tired of it. It's a stupid topic. It's a bunch of people. For whatever reason, care about what other people are doing and is always the same tired ass fucking argument about what about children. You're setting an example to the children to what? To what? To eventually be a person who's an adult who enjoys marijuana. That's life. That is real life. Like why are we have to pretend that that's that to hide that and you, you parent your fucking kids and don't let them do anything until they're in their twenties. I don't think kids should be getting drunk. I think you barely can keep your fucking shit together as a teenager, as it is emotionally, psychologically to get drunk on top of that. I mean, I did it. I know you did it, but it's a terrible idea. If I was going to be honest with my kids, I would say don't get drunk, don't get high, don't do shit while you're developing. Beat. Become uh, a man first. You know, I, people ask me why I'm so vocal about it and the reason I'm about it is

Speaker 2:          00:03:00       because I can get thrown in jail for it. So I'm going to be vocal about it until there's absolutely no possibility that I can get thrown in jail. And this is for the kids too. I'm fucking making a stand here. You are making a stand here in the future. By the time the kids are 18, 19, 20. Hopefully it will be legal. So we're doing this for the kids. But you know, I'm a big fan of Coca Cola. I love coke, but I never talk about it. But if it was illegal it was illegal to drink soda and you can get thrown in jail for it. I'd be talking about it every goddamned. I'm like, I'm drinking this fucking soda. I'd be videotaping me drinking soda. It's okay. Why are we being thrown in jail? Look, I'm a productive guy drinking coke. But you know what? It's legal. I'm not talking about it. And when weed is legal 100 percent all the way through, I'm gonna. Shut the fuck up about it. Watch.

Speaker 3:          00:03:50       I'm not going to shut up about it. I, I. It's a positive thing and that's what people aren't willing to accept. So many people want to think that it's a negative, it just shows a negative image or it sends a negative message that you need something to get through your life with, and that's not what anybody is saying. You don't need it. You don't need it, but it's good. It's that sense.

Speaker 2:          00:04:10       It's the wonder drug for me, like instead of taking tylenol off, smoke some weed, instead of doing this weed is so safe that if you smoke too much, you might call the cops on yourself. You're not going to call the cops on yourself. If you do a lot of heroin or you get too drunk, imagine getting too drunk and you're calling the cops on yourself on weed. You'll call the cops on yourself sometimes, you know?

Speaker 3:          00:04:31       Yeah. Weed is the safest of all of them and it's the most introspective evolve them. You know, alcohol doesn't make an introspective. It makes you an asshole, but weed makes you like sensitive about the things that you're saying. It makes you more aware of when you're being socially awkward. You know, you feel the sting of, you know, weird shit coming out of your mouth. Whereas when you're drunk, you don't give a fuck, it just comes back. It just pours out. You know? It's, it's an amazing thing that so many people believe different and yeah, it could fuck up your life. There's people that didn't smoke pot and become losers, but guess what? They would have been losers anyway. That's really what it is. And it's like what you're saying is the lazy people with no ambition who aren't that bright pop gets a hold of them.

Speaker 3:          00:05:15       It's gonna make it's gonna fuck up their life. Well guess what? Their life has already fucked up. If you let you know you, you come to certain roadblocks or certain things in your life where you have to sort of make decisions about your behavior, where you sort of have to reassess yourself. And if you can't get through the weed hurdle, really how the fuck are you going to deal with the real world if you can't get through the hurdle of weed? Because weed to me is the truth. That's what it is when I smoke pot. Yeah, I can say a lot of silly shit and I know you get weird and started talking about the universe, but what it is to me is the truth. Anything that's bullshit, anything that's a lie. Anything that's blatantly misleading when you're high

Speaker 4:          00:05:58       is just glaring, like acting is glaring. If you go to see a movie high and they're bad actors, it's gold layering. If you watch a political speech when you're high, it's glaring. You feel the bullshit where you like, what the fuck am I listening to? It's offensive to you. People have the wrong impression, man, and it's. It's a shame. It really is a shame. It's not that everyone should do it. You don't have to do it, but you shouldn't be upset if someone's telling you an honest interpretation of the positive experiences they have on it and people will go, well, you know, what do you always have to talk about? It's fucking annoying. Oh, you guys ever fucking talk about his week because there's still people out there that are arguing against it. There's still people out there that don't get it. It's a personal choice issue. You're a human being and it's the most Republican of all ideas. Stay the fuck out of my private life. Stay the fuck out of my personal life. Don't get, let government get too big. Well, this is exactly what this is. This is only something that's being pushed into illegality by gigantic corporations is the only way in this day and age that it would still be illegal. There's, there's resistance because people are making money with it being illegal. It's that simple.

Speaker 2:          00:07:19       And when you look, you look at the, like the movie reefer madness. It was made back in the thirties. It was produced by the government. And if you look at that and you see where it all came from and all came, that was the beginning

Speaker 4:          00:07:32       was actually made by alcohol companies in the beginning, in the beginning.

Speaker 2:          00:07:37       Um, they, they, they try to scare everybody by saying that we'd major kill and major crazy. You'll jump out of windows. You'll kill people. They made lots of movies. They made a whole bunch of them in the thirties. That was the reefer madness propaganda. It worked. Any negative negative thought you have about weed, it stems from that propaganda from the thirties. There's, it's not a conspiracy theory. There's many movies out there that you could watch. You could watch them on youtube. That's where it started. The reason why they don't say that, you know, you go crazy and you jump out of windows and you kill people and all that shit anymore is because people got hip to it. They believed in the thirties and the forties. But then, you know, people were, were smoking weed in the fifties and sixties. They were like, it's not making me crazy.

Speaker 2:          00:08:23       This is actually pretty cool. So they had to change their stance slowly. It evolved from weed kills you to weed makes you worthless, you know, that's, that's all because you know, they have a lot of examples because there are a lot of potheads who are worthless, but they're just worthless people. You know what I mean? So they just focus on that. Any negative thought you have for weed and marijuana? It's because you. We've all been brainwashed. I used to be the biggest weed hater ever until I was 28 my whole life. I couldn't stand potheads. They made me sick. I was just like, all those guys on the underground were writing all that shit. I would have been doing that. I would have been doing the same fucking thing. I was annoyed. Every band I was in had one or two potheads they fuck up on stage or they fuck up rehearsing.

Speaker 2:          00:09:09       I would blame the wheat. I go, dude, you gotTa fucking high. You fucking smoking weed. You can't play bass and smoke weed. I was so clueless. I didn't have any idea because every now and then I get talked into smoking weed in high. There was an high school moment. There was a moment and when I was 23, 24, that where I freaked the fuck out. I got all paranoid and I freaked out and I hated it. And Weed. What happens when you're high is it's like a roaring river of information. It just flooded into your brain. Some people don't want to ride those wild rapids. They're like, fuck that. I'll stay in the tent. Some people like it's wide, ride that wild, rapid and just absorb that energy and use it to benefit yourself. Some people, you know, when you get paranoid, I still get paranoid every now and then.

Speaker 2:          00:09:52       Every now and then that fucking roaring river. I don't want to do that. You know what I mean? I just, I just want to. I'm not into it. So it's all like the paranoia and you know, feeling Irie two opposite ends of the spectrum. It's all up to you with the weed. If you smoke weed, if you can get paranoid. If you can't handle all that information, you want to suppress a lot of that shit. Don't get high. You're. If you've got a lot of crazy stressful things on your mind, things that are making you nervous. You got to talk to some people but you don't know how to say you might get fired from your job or your, your wife's, you know, might be cheating on your whatever you're thinking about all that shit. If you smoke weed, you're gonna. Focus on that. You know?

Speaker 2:          00:10:30       So I, I recommend that you start smoking weed around 28, 30. I never recommend we do kids. I never do. I think it's best if you're fully developed, you know who you are, you know what kind of person you are. Especially if you're an artist, you have a lifetime of art. And then at 28 you see how your art changes every whatever art you do, it'll change. So you'll appreciate it. The later you wait. I would say wait till 30. Jack Herrera, the greatest hip activists out there, started smoking weed when he was 35. He was totally anti. We'd just like me, just like Joe. Joe Hated potheads. We were all just like you all those guys that think that are fucking throwing up in their mouth right now and they're sick of me and joe talking all that. All those guys, we were just like, you smart motherfuckers, you guys are smart.

Speaker 2:          00:11:16       But that we were brainwashed by the motherfucking government. We were brainwashed. It's really simple. So you should be happy that we're trying to tell you the truth. Don't deny the truth. We're telling you the truth man. And it's not some crazy alien conspiracy. This is some real shit. And by the way, it's only our subjective truth. If your truth is different than my truth of you do part and you don't like it, like Stan hopes, townhome just doesn't like wait. He doesn't like it. He doesn't like the feeling, which is fine, you know, no one's forcing you to do it. You know, the real problem is when people were upset at other people doing something that doesn't affect them, but they get upset at it, they, they, they see that

Speaker 3:          00:11:54       possible potential weakness in themselves. And so they lash out at it when they see it in someone else. I really think that's what it is. You know, they're, they're scared themselves that it's a, it's their future that they could get. They get hooked on a drug too. And that's how I look at it.

Speaker 5:          00:12:09       It's kind of cool it at talking about mushrooms. Mushrooms was on a cartoon the other day on a, a family guy like Sunday, 9:00, 8:30, they add, Brian found a bag of mushrooms and they showed the mushrooms that looked like the mushrooms and any aid, um, and went onto this huge mushroom trip and the whole episode was about Brian, like showrooming, like the majority of it. And it was kind of interesting to see that, that actually they had that on, on a regular show on TV. That was that the first time that, that may maybe like a primetime show actually dealt with mushrooms as well.

Speaker 3:          00:12:43       Simpsons the homer Simpson went into a chili cook off and eat.

Speaker 5:          00:12:48       So that was always kind of like, that was always kind of like, yeah, this is like mushrooms, you know, it wasn't like him eating a mushroom.

Speaker 3:          00:12:53       No. Was it, it was some sort of psychedelic pepper member. And the, the pepper is made him have these crazy trips. It was the most awesome Simpson's ever. Yeah. So they've done that before.

Speaker 5:          00:13:04       You would love this. I mean, it doesn't really look, make mushrooms look great. Like, this is not what I see when I, when I share my, my Sherman's, but it's definitely fun to watch. While showrooming, I think

Speaker 3:          00:13:13       there's a new study on mushrooms that magic mushrooms make you a better person and it stays with you for awhile. Like shrugging. So the thing is John Hopkins, yeah, researchers led by [inaudible] mccleon, a postdoctoral student at John Hopkins University analyzed personality data on 52 participants, average age of 46 years old who had participated in the groups earlier research on the drug. These volunteers took siliciden during to five two to five sessions at various doses under highly controlled conditions at the hospital. They were also given personality tests before the taking psilocybin and again, a couple months after each drug session and then again about a year later. And so what they're saying is that all these people have all said that it, it turns you into a better person that's there. It had a positive effect on their personality. Think about, think about some people went unchanged. It said, uh, um, think about

Speaker 2:          00:14:15       the fact that, you know, a lot of people are saying, Oh, you guys are just using the medical thing. Just isn't as an excuse to smoke pot. Oh, you guys are, you know, faking your ailments just to get a medical marijuana card. Yes, we are dumb dumb. We are. We have to go through the medical thing. This is the process of making it legal. Ultimately there won't be a medical marijuana, marijuana. Just going to be really faking it though I'm not faking it. I smoke weed for exactly what I tell a lot of things. I'm not saying you, I'm saying there are a lot of people would say that would just fake or whatever. I'm not saying who, but I'm just saying yes, we have get through the medical. It's a baby steps. Ultimately it won't be medical marijuana. It's just going to be adult use because now it's not.

Speaker 2:          00:14:58       It's not just, it's not just a neutral. It's actually, it's not like a vitamin. It's better than a vitamin. It actually cures diseases. It's better than just a vitamin or a protein. I mean, it, it, it, it's, it relieves glaucoma for instance, and now they're finding so many, there's so many studies of, of, uh, you know, reducing cancerous tumors and all that shit. Vitamins don't do this. This is a magic herb with no side effects. There's no side effects. No one's ever died from it. Why are you so worried about your kids doing it? Don't worry about it. I'm not, I'm not, I'm, I have a son coming and I'm going to tell them the truth. I'm not going to lie to Mama. Tell him the truth about weed and I'm going to tell him that he should not smoke until he's 28 to 30.

Speaker 5:          00:15:45       Why would you, why would you want him to wait so long now so that he could appreciate it more? There's a lot of young until I was 15 and I appreciate the fuck out of every time I smoke it. Not everybody, but there are some people, and I've mentioned the best examples. Well, I would think like the older you get, I, I, when I get older, I've noticed I'm more concerned about my health because your health starts to go when you're. You're getting old. I think if I were to start smoking weed when I was 30, I would even be more freaked out. You say this, but yet how do you smoke weed and smoke cigarettes at the same time? Because I got to think that if you don't do it on the same time, I had one in each hand and I just go from back and forth.

Speaker 5:          00:16:17       I would think that if I was smoking weed and I was also smoking cigarettes, the fact that I was smoking cigarettes would start to freak me out so bad that I would quit. I would realize how ridiculous it is and how crazy and terrible. We all know it's ridiculous and terrible and horrible for your body, but we're also addicted to it. It's like any other. Why don't you just carry around a packet, joints and just smoked joints all day? Because I don't. I don't. I'm not like Joey Diaz style. I like to smoke one or two hits and they go do something and then later I'll take one or two hits. I'm not like I am as well and this whole fucking joint. If you raise your tolerance, a panel wants to, you can get to the habit. I don't like being in a cloud. We'd instead of. I don't like being. I don't like being in a cloud. We'd cloud you mean? Yeah. Yeah. You can get definitely getting a weed cloud, especially if you're one of those wakened biggers, you know, he can.

Speaker 2:          00:17:03       My best of your health's not good. My Point Brian was, and I wasn't, I was saying some people that have been smoking since they were like 11 or 12 or whatever. I know some serious artists are super creative and uh, they, they tell me, I think you're giving them too much credit. I mean, we just chills me out. They smoke weed all day every day. Amazing artists like will, they just chills me out. I go, Dude, look at your gallery, dude. You're the one of the most creative molly's doing sculptures and you don't think the weed has. And it was hard for him to see it because he was always artistic and he always smoked weed so he couldn't see the difference if he weren't a smoked weed and did all this artistic stuff, you will still been a great artist I'm sure. But that would have been a difference in the art if you would have been an artist until he was 28 and then started is art would have definitely changed.

Speaker 2:          00:17:52       And what I'm saying is I would be way more concerned about my kid being an alcoholic or you know, getting addicted to coke or something. Shit. The people die from, you know, again, I don't want my kids smoking weed at 13 or 14, but worst case scenario he does. He does start smoking weed. It's not going to be the worst thing. I'm not going to trip out on it. I'm like, all right, fuck dude, you're smoking weed. How long have you been smoking? I go, you know, I really think you should fucking cool it or whatever. But you know, when he's an adult will be smoking weed together. Watch, watch.

Speaker 1:          00:18:28       Are you? Are we got. We got, we got, we got someone on the line know who's on the line.

Speaker 6:          00:18:34       Somebody on the line. You're going to live. What's up out there? Why you call him? I just think to not speak to any problem.

Speaker 1:          00:18:44       No one knows. What the fuck are you doing here? Are you going to get an iphone? Are you going to get the new one? Dude? No one knows what the fuck we're doing this like half a million people and maybe 10,000. How do you feel about weed

Speaker 6:          00:18:56       and I, I know I've talked to you. You're live on the air. Why? Why, why? Why I'm talking to you. I'm not joking here. You chose right here Eddie. I don't want to. Do you want to just be the podcast? I even tried to talk some sense for Joe Hogan. He's at least I can drop the bad guy.

Speaker 2:          00:19:20       Alright. Alright. We're going to have to. We're going to have to cut you off man. Joe Doesn't want to talk to you.

Speaker 6:          00:19:25       You don't want to talk. You know

Speaker 1:          00:19:30       I'm going to just turn it. That is the most inside of inside jokes. That 99 percent of the people listening to podcasts will not have any idea what the fuck that is. So

Speaker 5:          00:19:38       apple releases the iphone four s today and it's not the five, whichever one's thinking, but remember the three gs when the three g went to the three gs and that whisk. That was a real iphone and I think that's what they're doing here. Like I think there's going to be a five maybe around June or so, but this s isn't that bad. The cameras, you're just taking a wild guess. Well yeah and that's definitely a guest, but I mean they did it before, you know, like the three gs was not. It was a mild upgrade. That's why they never caught it. The Ford, the three gs added. What was it? I don't even remember like a better camera. So many rumors about this. It's, it's, it's. I always feel so. But then again, my life revolves around fucking being really into the next phone that comes out.

Speaker 5:          00:20:18       Right? What? That new Siri. There's a new intelligent assistant that helps you out and they, they, they did a demo today, which is a thing that you push and you pretty much ask it any question you want, you can be like, schedule me an appointment at 5:00 PM on Friday and then we'll go open up your calendar and go, do you want me to schedule this? And just say yes and then we'll schedule it. Or you can go, what's the weather like in New York? And be like the weather, the weather's this and it's like they showed a bunch of examples and you can see examples on apple.com or any of the websites that can gadget Gizmodo, but it seems legit. You can even say like call Joe, like the android stuff too. It's called Siri S. I don't know if that's how it's spelled. It's like an assist.

Speaker 5:          00:20:57       Yeah. Yeah. And it's pretty much the first step into having no interaction with having to touch your phone. So this looks like maybe in five years you're going to be texting by voice. You're going to be calling, you know, you're not going to. I would say this is a pretty good step. I wouldn't say it's 100 percent there right now. Like I don't think you're, you're still gonna. Use your google voice, the Google Google for you, uh, use your voice and you say, you know, 10th Planet Jiu Jitsu. You just use that as a surge boom. And it instantly pulls up all. I mean it's really accurate, like the way it picks up the things that you're saying, it's super. The thing that they showed today looks even more amazing that. And they also announced something that we talked about earlier about an idea I've had since I was a kid and now they have it as a feature on the phone and I'm like, Shit, should I, it's they call it, I forget what it's called, but mine was called snail mail where it was, where, I don't know if you remember, you would write an email to this company and the company would write it out and hand form and then send it to somebody.

Speaker 5:          00:21:55       And I originally said I thought of the idea because I wanted when my grandmother was still alive, I wanted to be able to email my grandmother, but then have somebody hand write it and then send it to my grandmother. Well now they just announced it on this new iphone that it's a feature and I forget what they call it, but that's one of the new features. Now it's like it's a real person hand writes it. I think it's either a handwriting. I don't know if they do it by person. I bet it's a printer that looks like handwriting. That's probably what they do. But that's what the whole thing is. It's two $99 per letter. But that's kind of funny that, that, you know, I should have fucking copyrighted that alongside Chinese people. That's all I'm thinking. I'm thinking the shops sweatshops people copying people's signatures.

Speaker 5:          00:22:35       Yeah. That shit would be horrendous if you found out that that was true. I can't imagine that there's really a business for that. But yeah, you did come up with that a long time. A long time ago and the camera looks awesome. Now they're using a whole new lens system, which is making an eight megapixel and hd is 10. 80 p I believe is what they should phone the same phone. You got to get a new phone, you got to get a new phone for the opera, for ss, a new phone. It's got. It's also got a dual processor now they switched to. They're a five chip, so now it's supposed supposed to be really fast. So yeah, it is a slight upgrade in some ways like the screens nine, any difference, but there is a lot of stuff under the hood. Did they improve upon going from apps back to your texting and sometimes you're just looking at a white screen for 20 seconds on your phone? No, no, no. Have you, have you cracked your friend before? I got a new phone. I kept dropping on, going from, going from like twitter to my texting, going back to the texting. You just got to sit there and it takes forever to cancel out the running programs. Do you know how to do that? No. Oh, that's the problem. Yeah. You got to cancel out. You're running programs, it's like a computer, it's really stupid, it's a stupid

Speaker 3:          00:23:46       fucking design, but if you press that home button, the button on your screen, you've got to press it twice and when it does that, a bunch of icons show up in the bottom of the screen and you've got to manually go through press one of them, you hold it and it gives you the option to delete it and then you go through all of them, deleting all of them and all you're doing is shutting them off. It's the stupidest thing ever. Is one of apple's dumbest clumsy as fuck.

Speaker 5:          00:24:08       Well, I don't think you're gonna have to worry about it too much anymore because this process is two times faster now in the graphics are seven times, but still the fact that all these applications stay open and running in the background is only running the first four. They might show all of it running, but the supposedly none of those other programs are running except the first four and then that even that, the cameras, the camera though, 33 percent more light. Like why isn't it when you shut it off, it's off because it's, it's called multitasking so you can go through it back and forth it and now it's, it's, it's so it keeps a program running, but only supposedly I thought only kept the first for it might show all the other programs, but it's only actually using the first Ford. That's cool though because I have

Speaker 3:          00:24:50       had to tweet something and somebody sent me a text and then a copy and the text and then go right back to tweet and it's wearing the same page. That's exactly where it was. Which wouldn't be if I had to close it and open it.

Speaker 5:          00:25:01       Yeah, that's huge. That's huge. Yeah, that's pretty good. The problem is going back like you're gonna have to before you go to texting, you gonna have to shut off everything off. That's probably even slower than just hitting the Teks and waiting for like 20 seconds. Right? I mean they need to work on that because that's a big fucking way. What would she say? What did you say? What was that again? So you got to turn off these programs so that you don't get that delay going back to the text. No, no, no, no, no, no. That's, that's, that's the process or a thing for the most part. I mean you can be running for intensive programs. Like if you had something crazy on like ustream broadcaster, I don't even know if that's an intense program or a video game that might slow it down a lot, but this is two times faster now, so you probably won't be having that problem if that is the case of those four programs. Very interesting.

Speaker 3:          00:25:45       New phones supposedly has, it has two antennas, one antenna that sends one antenna that receives instead of it both happening at the same time. So like it's supposed to double. I might not be interpreting it exactly correctly, but it's supposed to be able to double the downloads.

Speaker 5:          00:26:04       Yeah. I don't know about the intensity. I do know that it uses the verizon antenna, but I didn't see. I'm looking for that right now. What you're talking about. That would make sense. That'd be awesome. If it had a, an intended for both.

Speaker 3:          00:26:13       I read about it, I don't know which one of the websites or read about it, but they said they had basically they had duplicated four g speeds with a three g device or what? Some people consider four g speeds, you know, because there's some bunk ass four g right? If you get that verizon four g, that's bad ass man. I got up one of those. A laptop cards, man at the airport. If you're in a place where it's four G, it's. It's amazing. It's like Wifi. It's like the best Wifi. It's really good.

Speaker 5:          00:26:40       What I want to know though is is this new version and it sounds like what you're talking about, this would make sense. Is this new version for verizon? Are you going to be able to talk and do data at the same time? Now the four lte network. You can do that. Okay. But this isn't. But this isn't. The Lte network is a four g anything that's forward. Right. So this isn't for GE. That was one of the big things that that I think because the network's not ready for iphone. I think you're right.

Speaker 2:          00:27:03       You know, one, one thing that I think they need to improve upon. I think if they put like a, like a headphone ear piece on each side where you can like click it off and it's wireless and you can put it on your, you know what, I'm going to click advanced headphones with you because so many times I like, I forget to bring my fucking headphones on. You know how many times I buy headphones at the God damn airport if they just had one to like clicked on, like the corners you can pop it off and there's. And then you lose it and then your iphone is everyone's gonna love lost that like the first week or whatever, but some or you know, you know where you could pull it out and then there's a wire even though, because you know what I mean. And then you pop it back in. Are you talking about headphones for listening to the things or talking on the phone? Headphones for listening to shit videos. You're not talking about photography. Well then it would work for that too. Why not? But I mean, I never used a headphone and talk on the phone. I always hold the phone up to my. Yeah,

Speaker 5:          00:27:53       but the more I'm reading about radiation, the more reading about cell phone radiation, the more it really has to be thinking. I'm really starting to think is there really something to that? Because the, the what they accept, like they say what the acceptable range of radiation you're allowed to have this whole time. The wizards were right talking on speakerphone outside is the way to go there. They're concerned about their brother,

Speaker 2:          00:28:16       their radiation product, lizards. Oh, that's hilarious.

Speaker 5:          00:28:21       With black dudes who are really aggressive, who talk on the speakerphone on their cell phone wizard wizards, smart wizards, because they're not getting radiation in their head. What is wrong? That's what if those all those people that use speakerphone. I'm not saying, but I'm talking about everybody on my ex girlfriend does it to all those people that use the speakerphone is that they're probably thinking of it that maybe maybe you know when you get to this four g shit too, now you've got some super potent flying through the air. What is all this shit flying through the air man? Where's that? How's it

Speaker 2:          00:28:50       going? I mean, how, how does that interact with ourselves? The fact that all these different Wifi signals and we could put on a like one of those infrared goggles, but you could see everything. Like you can see the cell phone signal and the information coming through if you could just be everything. You know what I mean? We're in a sea of like frequencies. Who the fuck knows what that actually looks like. Someone knows how it works. Like who the fuck figured out how that cell phone works. You know what I mean? Now we're sending video through the air. Someone figured out that there was like some tracks that we can put information on an Ra and Jesus is magic and when you're in a place that has nothing, there's a certain sound to the silence like of the mountains. There's a certain sound where it's almost like all us isn't

Speaker 1:          00:29:42       really a sound, but it just a very low frequency that we can't tune into. Imagine if it just affects your everyday consciousness. You just don't realize it. If your everyday consciousness just slightly pressured by all of these vibrations that are around you all the time, all these cell phones, signals and fucking Wifi signals and satellite signals and radio signals and fuck. Imagine if that is really fucking with our personalities. Imagine if you'd be a different person or at least add. Feel different. Yeah. Add. Who knows, who knows how many different things. Who knows? Oh, I wonder what all this shit is doing to us. It's only been around for a few. You know, how long it started with TV signals and radio signals or radio furs than TV and then. And it mean, but within the last couple decades, the amount of infiltration in our lives by frequencies and

Speaker 2:          00:30:35       walkie talkies. Man, how the fuck did they forgot walkie talkies? You know what I mean? That's amazing. A walkie talkies fucking crazy.

Speaker 1:          00:30:45       Well, they use to be able to send things and they weren't encoded either. You'd have to have to manually encode their information because they didn't want people that were. The enemy was tuning into their shit too. So everybody had to talk in code. Wrap your head around that like not only is there no email but you when you, when you send some signal out, anybody can get that signal. So you're in the bottom of the summary.

Speaker 2:          00:31:06       De de, De, De, De, De, de, De, de.

Speaker 1:          00:31:08       The Japanese are listening. They hear your fucking signal. You can't, you can't just send it just to you.

Speaker 2:          00:31:13       It's crazy like that. As technology just snowballs. It's the more access we have that instant information, infinite information. The more, the more free we feel, the more we can get. Keep track of, you know, like the government get they get when you want to. CSI Shit. Every move you make they could just break it down from your cell phones. They know what cell phone tower you hit, they know exactly where you were from, the cell phone towers. They can go back and all the deleted messages that you all shit you deleted. They can go back and retrieve them like there's some kind of imprint of this shit somewhere like, holy fuck. We think like, oh, we're more powerful, more connected. We're more under control that more than anything. You know, every little move we make, they, they know exactly. If they needed a pinpoint somebody how easy it is to fucking find somebody. You're going to live off the grid. How long is that going to last? You better go to the Amazon jungle. You know what I mean? That's the only place you're going to survive. They'll find you.

Speaker 1:          00:32:08       Well, it certainly, it's the connections. Much more immersive than it's ever been before. There's never been any at any point in time where people are so easy to get in contact with other people. Yeah, I know. Did you, did you hear about that guy that are around your neighborhood? Uh, he flew off the, a side of a cliff and there wasn't cell phone service there, so we couldn't use a cell phone and he, him and he got in a car accident with another person or something like that. And then both of their cars are down there. The other guy died. And so his body was like everywhere and broke,

Speaker 5:          00:32:40       like every single bone in his body was still alive and he tried to crawl out, but he couldn't move because everything was broken. And for 10 days he sat down there with his dead guy living off of grass and bugs and creek. There was like a little creek water, I guess he would, he would drink, but for 10 days he lived there. And then one day his love his son or something like that was going down the road, like looking, there's still kind of looking for them and stuff. And he hurt his dad's help yell for help. And they found his body, but he didn't have cell phone service there. And if he would have had been able to. He said he, the whole time was just searching his cell phone, his cell phone died and stuff. But can you imagine 10 days on the bottom of a creek and there's not cell phone service and it was just all fucked up. So we couldn't walk out of there. Yeah. But he's alive now and he's, uh, he's doing, he's recovering and everything. But imagine being 10 days at Brown and dead person too. It's also just think of

Speaker 4:          00:33:30       a how vulnerable your body is. And if you body breaks, you're just stuck. You can't move, you know? I don't think most of us don't wrap our heads around that. Your body breaks, then you can't move. And then being out in the woods so you get to things that scare the fuck out of people being alone out in the uncharted wilderness. Hearing cars drive

Speaker 5:          00:33:51       you above you. Everyday it's on be is just a side of the roads, you know, in some area that's, you know, people drive by every day. That might as well be uncharted wilderness. Nobody goes. Yeah, they said, they said that people fly off of those clips all the time and never get found because it's just like, who goes down there? No one goes down there. Nobody goes looking to find cars down there all the time. Yeah, that's just, that's a scary thing, man. That's the cliff driving ever do the Pacific coast, Pacific coast all the way up to Monterrey and all the way that.

Speaker 4:          00:34:20       Ooh, that's scary. It's beautiful. Fuck the first time I did it, I was 28 years old and I never took that drug. I was like, I live in California, and I never knew that. It was one of the most beautiful states ever. Incredible scenery. It's so cliffs in the rocks. It's so hard to even wrap your head around. It's magnificent. I kept pulling over the girl I was with. We took a little trip for a couple of days. He kept. I kept pulling over just videotaping. I couldn't believe this was California. I'm like, Holy Shit. I've never been up to northern California before on the east coast. There's a lot of parts of that fucking drive. Were you just counting on the other asshole on the other side to just be cool? He'd been together. Stay in your lane. Don't be texting. Isn't it crazy how they put a big halt to that satellite phone? Remember it was big like six, seven years ago. It was like the future, like, and the commercial was dude was in the wilderness on a mountain and he was making a call like, this is the best shit, and then boom, they just shut it all down. No, they have satellite phones. They still don't. How come it didn't blow up? Oh No, it's not that efficient. Yeah. It wasn't a world phone now, didn't they have, didn't they? Didn't, they shut down the satellite phones because of the whole terrorism thing.

Speaker 5:          00:35:29       I think they briefly shut them down around that time period, but I don't think. I think they still have, um, somebody had a satellite phone the other day or a.

Speaker 1:          00:35:38       Oh wait, that was last. Nevermind. I think they, I think they use them on a sort of fear factor. If we used to use them all the time. We used to have to use satellite phones. There were certain sets that we'd beyond, but there was nothing. There was nothing. You didn't think of it. That would be huge. I thought I thought they got shut down a expensive. I don't think the sound quality's that good either. I think that's a big delay is a little more, I shouldn't say a big delay. It's fucking amazing. It goes up to the sky and then back down and that's what reporters should have phones that like regular phones with like fucking nine g you got the satellite. If you need it, you just click on the little thing just in case like these stories flag off cliffs and shed get lost in the woods.

Speaker 1:          00:36:18       You know how many movies have like someone getting chased and their cell phone signal, so now it's a good idea because now there's the t the chips are slowly shrinking to the point where you could get all that in in one phone, but if you ever look at the satellite phones, there's a reason where there's big giant bricks. I mean the receiver has to be completely different than a little tiny one. Internal. I'm going to be the new pimp floss. Then it's also nowadays cars. Cars have it built in like my car has a feature in it that you can turn on that if I can in a car accident and automatically texts my gps and sends it and calls nine. One one. Yeah, for does that right? Saying somebody told me this and I don't know if it's true. So twitter people fucking informed me.

Speaker 1:          00:36:57       Tell me if this is true. Somebody said that the dude bought a corvette and it had that. What is the thing? The onstar system on star guy was going down the highway going 148 miles an hour or something crazy like that. Onstar shut off his car now called the police. Now that's not true. You sure that's not true? One hundred percent and that's not true. No way that the onstar even is monitoring how fast or driving or do anything. I thought it saves information. If you're in a wreck they can find out that your data might save it. But there's so many cars. I have onstar and the fact that they actually have people sitting there will go in. All right, he's going 120 over here. You know there's no one monitoring that. That'd be unless you get in a car accident, maybe it's the program itself.

Speaker 1:          00:37:35       Maybe onstar itself when it recognizes that you hit a certain amount of miles per hour, they shut your car off if you don't think that's possible. I know it's possible that they could shut it off if someone's driving it. Right? Can't they shut her off? What's that called, Jack Something Jack? I think I've done that. The crux of them, they'd done that to people before. Shut their cars off while they're driving. It seems like they have. I don't know, maybe I'm making this up. It seems like a car. That was that one reality show where people steal cars. That's what I'm thinking. Like you know the way things are going to kill switches, it looks like, you know, I don't know. I could be wrong, but it looks like in the future, like it's just going to be mandatory. It's going to be a law that the CHP or the police department or whatever the fuck they call the forest back then has gps on your shit and like the DMV and they just monitor every mile you drive, so anytime you fuck up they just send you tickets. They go, we have your gps fingerprint. You manage your gps record. Can you imagine that shit? Fuck them cameras. Like in England they got cameras, they got better. You know that. They take pictures, but they're not going to need that. The DMV just gonna Monitor your driving every day you'll have a sheet. Oh, he broke. You know there's a ticket. Here's a ticket. Boom. No more hiding. No more speeding.

Speaker 1:          00:38:52       You have to go to a track if you want to go fast than spots like that and we can't. Sometimes speed limits. Ridiculous. For the most part, it's speed limits. Probably pretty smart to have a, a decent number set and a lot of places, but there's a lot of places where it's silly like the highway, the fuck out of here. Will you see 55 miles an hour, get the fuck outta here. That's stupid. That's a stupid way to move. Fifty five miles an hour. How? What kind of car do you have? Maybe if you're a fucking old jalopy back when they instituted that speed limit and it made sense because if you're going more than 55 miles an hour and old fucking Chevy Nova, one of those six cylinder shit boxes, you know those break suck dude. You know if you're actually going fast and one of those cars.

Speaker 1:          00:39:37       I mean they're awesome cars when people rebuild them, don't get me wrong, but I mean in compared to today's technology, the technology, those cars, they couldn't handle well and they couldn't break well. I haven't had that much where you're breaking the car, slamming on the brakes. That's scary. That's a common. That's why. That's why we need to move to Texas. I heard that they now have their voting to get the speed limit. Moved to 90 I think is what they were saying. Maybe it was 80, but there's a lot of parts of Texas I fucking love. Oh, speaking of which, I'm in Texas this weekend. Powerful Verizon Center this Friday night, and you haven't been to Houston so long, you still use the own Houston every time you went into town you would sell me. No, I know, but you would sell out every single show. That was the biggest market and then they closed the comedy club that we love to go to.

Speaker 1:          00:40:21       I went to the second member of boy in Houston, I'd want to say his name, but I remember a boy in Houston. He came out on the road with us. Um, red devil when he was in red. Classic. He never came on the road with us. We were always going on the subject and no one's going to know what the fuck I'm talking about. Yeah, that's why you explain it. There's a mic. We got three hours but you otherwise. But this place just about Toyota Toyota Center or Verizon Center. I can't remember where the standup is. Yeah, yeah. You were on a radio station there the other day and he said that radio was pretty ridiculous. Like, yeah, they were nice. They were cool. They played that a supernanny song. They play your song all the time. Yeah. He was just quoting a bet that I did. I was like, what are you talking about?

Speaker 1:          00:41:10       I don't even know that bit, but now after I got off the phone with them I was like, damn, I think he was right. I think that is a line in one of my old bits that I forgot because he was talking something about toe ring. I'm like, have a jug about a toe ring. And he goes, you could do. And I'm like, are you high or drunk? I don't remember a joke about a tour. I think it's like a line in one of my old old jokes, you know, if you play like I've played back my shit from like 1999 and it almost as if like it's someone else's

Speaker 4:          00:41:34       material. I don't even know it anymore, you know? I mean I remember it. Yeah. That was one of my jokes, but I don't even know them anymore. So if like somebody quotes like a little piece of it, I might not even know what the fuck they're talking about. It seems so weird for something that for years you're so intimately connected to, but when you have material and then you abandoned it and start on some new material, you fucking forget every did when you started smoking weed was at 30 to 30, 31 and 30. He went from like pure Dick Jokes and relationship jokes and chick jokes and cock blocking jokes and then right into your pyramid bit. You started smoking. When did the paramed bid people? Dumb people. People out. Fucking smart people and a staggering pace. Why doritos are so funny and wacky. Yeah, it changed my comedy for sure.

Speaker 4:          00:42:20       We'd made a complete turn in my comedy. You know, it's like I just Kinda, I learned to see things differently. You know, you got some good classics before we'd done for sure fucking time. Nicole Smith the tiger. But how many times have I been on the road and I just wanted to hear the title. I've heard a thousand times. I'm always like, you know, like shut up motherfucker. That was one of those bits. It was so hard to let go. I love tiger with the ultimate bit. Now I'll never get tired of that one. I had to let it go though. Whenever you have a, you know, you got new material. You can't keep remembering the old material. I really don't remember exactly how can I get a tiger sound just to give me a little fucking so real roar. That was on the fair. I can't remember.

Speaker 4:          00:43:14       You had a better job too. What was that? Remember when the bear attack, the karate trainer. There was a. That was the guy who was a trainer and he's dressed in a karate outfit and he had a lady come onstage to them and the lady sat in the chair and the bear turned and looked at the lady and just started fucking her up. Just started fucking her up, but it was just like the bear just woke up and realized I'm a fucking bear and then it just starts wailing like out of nowhere to dude that a karate outfit. He was trying to protect the guy on youtube. That was way before you go debt. No, no, no, no. That's the story. Actual store video. Yeah. I bet that. I bet somebody put it online down. I would like to see because I heard so much youtube.

Speaker 4:          00:43:53       I heard that joke so much is crazy. Never actually seen the real footage of air. Just turns this lady and starts fucking her up for no reason. She sat down. That's the weirdest thing about animals, man. Sometimes you don't realize, but like, like trained animals, like sometimes they're just tweaked like they're tired of this. They don't want to do this anymore. This is stupid. I don't want to be led around why you fucking with me? What's going on here? And then it looks normal because they do it every day and they don't know how to communicate, but they're a little tweet and so they sit down and the fucking lady sits right now next to him and he just decided to fuck her up out of nowhere. And it looks like it's out of nowhere, but it's been built up all day because you got this fucking stupid bear doing somersaults.

Speaker 4:          00:44:35       You know, you've got this bear, you know, instead of killing deers in eat and berries and shit, this bears running around on chairs. You know, playing musical chairs are porter, what the fuck are you doing, man? That's a. that's a big, crazy unpredictable animal. There's a video of a dude who is training a bear and he was training with, I believe it was his brother or his cousin, someone who is a close family member, I think it was his brother, and the bear just turns on the guy for no reason and rips his throat out. It happens in 30, not even 30 seconds, 10 seconds, maybe a maximum for no reason. They're all had this bear in this room. The bed just turns on. The guy goes right at his neck and rips it out and the guy bled out and died right there. Isn't it crazy that some when when these trained animals, a lot of them, when they attack, they don't kill him because it's like they give them another chance.

Speaker 4:          00:45:29       They might like the killer whale. Didn't they get that killer whale like band this bear? They didn't kill this bear. It's a why. It just seems like it's costs more money to retrain another bear than to pay the insurance policy on. You know what I mean? It's gotTa. It's gotta be what it is. I don't get it. You know, I don't get it. I don't get it. I don't understand how anybody can convince anybody that had a bear that wants, that has already killed a person who offered no threat whatsoever. That thing, if a person did that, you would kill them. You give them the death penalty in a right society. If you saw someone run up to someone for no reason to rip your throat out, you would kill them. Why the fuck would you give a bear more rights and you'd give up maybe not killed a bear because I don't blame the bear for doing that.

Speaker 4:          00:46:12       But like, you know, throwing, you know, uh, it, lock them away somewhere or something. You know what I mean? Don't continue to use them as a buffoon. I was going to attack again. Lock in a bear away would be cruel and unusual punishment. I'd say just put one in his fucking dome and at them in the wild. Fuck it. Give him a chance. He, they, that you take and you train and you do all that within it turns and eats your brother's fucking throat in front of you. You're supposed to kill that thing like crazy wild thing that you thought you were in control of. The fuck is wrong. If it was up to me, I would take them up to the mountains and give him a check and now you probably had another lose. No survival skills or anything good luck, but at least you give them a chance.

Speaker 4:          00:46:49       Who knows? Maybe they could make it maybe, but they're probably not. That's terrible idea because then you set an animal loose that's used to being in contact with human beings and you set them out in the woods and he will find human beings and it poses a direct threat to those people. They're really dangerous. Once you have habitualized a bear to people, they have to lock them up. They have to put them in cages in zoos. The zoos we went to in Colorado, I learned that there because they had these bears and these bears had gotten their big ass grizzlies man, big ass brown bears and they um, they were getting into people's garbage and once they find this is where the people keep the food, it's a source of food. They won't go away. You can't scare them, you know, at a certain point in time, they just get used to you and they just fuck you. So unless

Speaker 3:          00:47:29       you shoot them, they have to have someone come and capture them and they leave and they take them away.

Speaker 7:          00:47:34       You can't just let that bear, I lose lose. You'd find people in that. One time I did, I did five grams of mushrooms and I went to the zoo. I thought it'd be a great idea and by the time I got to the zoo, that's when it started kicking in. I blew up at the zoo. That freaked me out. I'm like, fuck, these animals are fucking sad as hell. They're all captured there in prison. I ran out of that. Got Em zoo. That's how those people are jumping into the polar bear bear cages. I bet they're always on shrooms or bear. The polar bear was there's like, it's like a little fucking old school little auditorium theater thing that you got for this polar bear and there's a door and I backstage and it just kept walking through that door and then walk away from the door like a couple of yards and walking back waiting for someone to open that door and it was just pacing back and forth nonstop. This polar bear like, wow, I freaked the fuck out. I was just hoping

Speaker 3:          00:48:29       some asshole comes and opens the door and he can bite them and drag them and finish him off. You know? That's what they're doing. They're just dying for someone to go in there so they could track them. Great. That's why they you. You ever seen the video? The lady getting her leg broken. He. He bites down on her leg and he's pulling her leg through the fucking bars. It's polar bears are motherfuckers, man. They're real motherfuckers and you don't ever really tame those things. Those things are. They're the craziest bears of all because they're the straight carnivore bears. All the other bears eat fruits and berries. It's no fucking fruits and berries with the polar bear lives. Just Coca Cola, just just seals and people and whatever the fuck else he can eat whales, the whales, they find a hole where a whale got stuck under a giant sheet of ice. The whale can't go anywhere, so every time the whale comes up to get some air, boom, polar bear. Jackson takes a bite out of them. So these whales, like you see him and after a while they're the top of their back. It's just destroyed. Whoa. From polar bears, just biting them over and over and over and over again, and then eventually they kill it. So small whale or something like that. It gets stuck in their pilot whale. They just slowly bite them to death.

Speaker 7:          00:49:41       That's incredible. Did you see the video that Mary Archie Band playing a song music for? I think it was a. What are the snow lions or something like that? Snow leopards snow. There's big things as big blobby. They almost like hippos. Like what's the ones that are all seals and sea lions? Maybe that, but it was so cool. They were the. It looked like it was having a fun time watching, like it was going back and forth. It's explaining what you saw. Okay. Here I'll show it to you. It's a, I think it's on Google. Mariachi band, Mariachi band. A Sea lion. So they're playing the music and the sea lions dancing along with it. Is that what you're saying? Yeah, it's, it's amazing. And like, uh, when the trumpet players

Speaker 1:          00:50:28       would like to do in, like tilt his head up and down and then would head up and down and it just looked like it was having the time of its life. It's one of the coolest videos I've seen. I'll find it right now for the wonder. I always wonder like what music, what kind of an effect music would have on animals because you know, in the animal kingdom it's actually a Beluga whale occasion at all. But why wouldn't music impact them the same way it impacts us? Why wouldn't it be exciting and interesting to them?

Speaker 8:          00:50:54       It's actually a Beluga whale and if you look at it, it's a on [inaudible] dot com. It's Mariachi Band serenades, that Beluga whale and it's just going back and forth.

Speaker 1:          00:51:06       Well that makes sense as well as a way smarter than you realize.

Speaker 8:          00:51:10       And they started. It is. I didn't, I didn't, I couldn't remember what it was.

Speaker 1:          00:51:21       They start playing more and more and it starts really like nodding its head and you know, you know what's interesting about this, that we're, we're amazed that this is intelligent because if that was a person and if you like, look at my boy, I took my boy to see the Mariachi band. Look how my boy nods. Nods. He acknowledges them, they acknowledged him back. My Boys. Brilliant. So far is not really doing anything but what I'm saying to get better. The only reason why this is interesting is because it's not a human. If it's a person that's a drooling idiot listening to bad music.

Speaker 8:          00:51:59       Okay, wait, let me see. I'm like, get to the good part

Speaker 1:          00:52:05       right now. He's just going, what the fuck are those hats? Or before they hear the nodding with the, with the music and stuff like that. I mean it's kind of cute. I'm not saying it's like a breakthrough in science or anything. It's just a cool video to watch. I think you were saying it was a breakthrough in science. I think that's. I think that dolphins like you guys got fish or something. What's going on? Yeah. I think he's bored as fuck. Trapped in snack time. What's going on? People are filming him. I chose assholes. Make weird music. Yeah. Poor thing. See in jail. Things in jail. No wonder he fucking stare at you when it comes to the glass. Yeah. Wow. Amazing. I'm going to let me go. Did a Freedom Day. That's the thing that we have to be the most concerned about with aliens, man, because of the disrespect that we have for everything even remotely dumber than us.

Speaker 1:          00:52:52       Even whales, killer whales, orcas, dolphins. Those are thought to be really intelligent animals. We don't totally understand their, their languages. We know that they have, like some of them have dialects and she'll like. There's. They're really complicated. Both killer whales and dolphins. They're like cousins of each other, but we don't understand what they say, so we were like, mm, I don't give a fuck getting the tank, and we just forced them into prison for us. We and we all go watch them perform and fly through the air and splash as everybody claps. We're watching slaves were watching babies that stolen from

Speaker 3:          00:53:26       their mothers, from intelligent animals that miss them and we don't care because we don't understand what they're saying. La, la, la. I'm not listening. What's the latest on deciphering the Dolphin or whale language? I mean because we're trying to teach them our words like jump. That's the tricky thing. They, you know, they can recognize many, many human words, but we can't understand a single thing they're saying there's got to be someone on the case trying to decipher that shit will be. Leary was not timothy leary rather. I'm the guy who created, created the isolation tank. Goddammit. Is there some new shit with the isolation tank where they're sending radio waves through it now? Is there. So is that the latest thing or is that still you laying in water at a certain temperature or is there some electromagnetic shit going on now? Will they do have a John Lilly do?

Speaker 3:          00:54:06       They do have some where they, um, they play sound float lab has got some crazy new video screen that they're developing where it's, it sits right in front of you and has the lowest possible emission of light so that you don't see the machinery at all. All you see is the image that's being played on this DVD because you're in total complete darkness in there. And the speakers are these, these sort of underwater waterproof speakers that are beside each year. They're fixed, fixed in place. So you set yourself in between these two speakers and then this video plays. And in the sensory deprivation environment, when you're in there, you are weightless and body list and you don't feel shit. You feel like you're flying through the universe and then all of a sudden this image appears right before you. And the sound of it. It sounds pretty dope.

Speaker 3:          00:54:51       I haven't tried it though. Well, I like going in there and just, I don't want to, I don't, I'm not looking to add anything. I'm looking to figure out what the fuck is out there. You know, when I go into the tank, I'm never thinking, oh, how dope would this if I played a whole lot of love while while I was in there. Let's get. I'm gonna get high as fuck. And then um, uh, you know, it would be cool to do, but to me, my time in there, what I, what I'm, what I gravitate towards is doing it with nothing. I'm, I like, I like, I like silence and I like seeing where the fuck my crazy imagination takes me or where, where, where the muse takes me, wherever, whatever happens.

Speaker 7:          00:55:29       Now imagine recording of it. Did you see that thing where scientists can now record, and this is scary. This is a thing they have on Gizmodo, but where they had somebody watch a bunch of videos and, and then they recorded the brain's activity and they, they show on this video. It compares what they actually saw and what the brain sees the cats. I've seen that they've recorded, so can you, can you imagine now that that like 10 years from now they're going to be able to like record everything that you see. You're not going to be able to lie anymore. You're not going to be able to do anything where it's headed. Ultimately they'll. There'll be waterproof iphones that you could swim with and that translates what you're saying to dolphin language so that you can just communicate with dolphins. I mean, it's getting crazy, right? I don't think they're ever going to be able to figure out the dolphin thing. They're so far off. Dolphin APP never say never. Humans, humans communicating with humans is going to get real weird man. You know, can figure that dolphin

Speaker 4:          00:56:24       boy, they're not close. They're not even close. I don't know what the fuck the dolphins are saying. You don't know what. They can't talk the dolphins. They can't send out a message to the dolphins. Hello Dolphin world. We are friendly, but what if they created some instrument where they decide for some sounds and they go, let's see what this sound. You know, dissect the sounds, edit them, put them together and then plan for the Dolphin and maybe the dog because that doesn't make any sense, but that was kind of weird, right? They may slowly put words together like, oh, we got eat. We got the one for. Even if they had like rewords down, you know what I mean? Then they go, I mean maybe we should research where the, the, the Dolphin communication world is that right now I want to know. I want to.

Speaker 4:          00:57:01       I know that a mentoree John Lilly, that was one of the reasons why I created a what, what would he rather uses that he used the tank for? He used to put a tank on isolation tank right next to the dolphin tank and he would drop acid and get into the tank and communicate with the dolphins and he's like this pioneer and interspecies communication and because of that, but what does that mean? I mean, how much have they figured out? As far as I know, they have figured out very little and I think we're the whole dolphin language is a mystery, but we do know that they have dialects. We know that different dolphin pods have like a, like if they're from a different place, I'll have like a different twice. If they know that they can tell that the different dialect, they can decipher one little sound like maybe, maybe something in the.

Speaker 4:          00:57:44       I think it's a matter of context. If you lived in a world, see we have. We live in a material world as as the ocean oceans and material world, but it's in a material world where you're not stuck to the ground. You're going all over the place, your world, your you've are flying through your world. Everyone is flying through the world of the ocean. It's a completely different experience to not be able to alter your environment, to develop some sort of intelligence to the level that dolphins have and, and orcas have to the point where they'll help people. They recognize when people are in trouble and they help them. Like killer whales will like help people get to boats. I want to see, I want to read something on that twitter people I want some like documented that's happened where and exactly what's happened. Like how the hell bent more than one instance of guys capsizing boats and Orcas helping them help them back into the boat to amazing how they don't attack humans.

Speaker 4:          00:58:39       They don't. People swim with like a pod of Orca where they go, they. Yeah. I don't know if they will let you do that man. I don't know if they have children. That doesn't seem to be a good idea. I know you know people have been bitten or nudged or bumped and shit before, but I think they're pretty fucking easy going with people. There was something I read online a long time ago, but it turned out to be horseshit. It was that people used to get killed by killer whales all the time until a fighter pilots in world war two started using orchids for target practice, you know, and they don't do shit like that. I mean they would use like killer whales or sharks or something like that for target practice when they're dry fly. And I heard that, and then all of a sudden killer whales stop killing people. They had like some kind of committee and says, you know

Speaker 2:          00:59:22       what, it's a. it's a good idea for the, for the existence of our species. Don't fuck with these humans. These pink monkeys with their bang sticks. You don't want to be fucking with them. They can do some damage. They can get out in our world that we can't go to their world. So they just get in big wooden boats and go out to our world. And as long as the boat's big enough, you get in one of those giant ocean liner type things. What the fuck's killer? We're going to do that. You can just go around and jacking up left and right. It was terrible environment they live in. It's crazy how the dolphins and the Caribbean or in the Gulf of Mexico or the Bahamas, not area, the ones they study, they did a documentary on it and it's a trip. How they capture females, they capture them either to males.

Speaker 2:          01:00:05       It's either two males and they captured one female at a time for like a month and then they jacker or it's a big group of males like 15 to 20 and they capture a bunch of females and make sure they don't swim off the pot and they're just taking turns on them and it's funny is the girls want to leave. They want to take off. They don't want to be captured, not because they don't want to have sex, but because they want to have sex with as many males in that region, so when they have their baby, if they. It's like a. A woman female dolphin had sex with a hundred male dolphins when she gives birth and she asked to watch over her child for the first three or four years. If she runs into and she's by herself with her child, they're just swimming around when they run into males.

Speaker 2:          01:00:48       If those males have had sex with her, they'll leave her alone. If those males that run into a didn't have sex with her, they will kill that baby and then capture her and bring her into their little Harem. They will kill the baby boy, that's not that, but if they run into them, so that's so the female has to have as much sex as possible. She's down with the sexual, but she wants to leave and go find some more guys before the baby hatches. It's crazy, right? It's insane. It's insane. But it's the same because people think of dolphins as being these fun, loving, whimsical fairies of the sea. There are cousins that are fairies in the sea. They're all loving because you know they're, they're cool as fuck to us. You know, if you ever in a boat and you're swimming by some dolphins are robots, dolphins, they'll jump up and play with you.

Speaker 2:          01:01:34       You know, it's interesting, but in the dolphin world, when things get hard, shit gets crazy. Yeah, I know when it's a big group of males and they run into a couple of dudes who have captured a check, they will jack those dudes. And steel is steel there, girl like that. This is our girl now. Crazy evil bitches. So dolphins are just like people a lot of ways. Everything intelligent. This is what I was saying, things in that region. Not all dolphins, I don't think all Davao, they all have their own special, but every mating rituals. Well, you know, killer whales killed dolphins all the time and not only that, killer whales got their name not from being killers, but from killing whales. That's what they, that's where they came up with the name of killer whales, killer whales. Fuck whales up. There's some horrible videos of killer whales

Speaker 1:          01:02:19       biting a whale's face off like a blue whale or something. Yeah, like a big, big ass whale and just jack and his face and the wheels trying to swim away and they're just fucking this whale up and it's like, it makes you really like, think like, wow. Like what we think of is like some cute thing that does tricks at the zoo. That's a murdering monster that lives in the ocean and they're smart and think about what we do to them. It's just we don't give a fuck. We can't understand them. So we just put them in the cage. Get in there, bitch. I don't know what you're saying.

Speaker 7:          01:02:50       They're going,

Speaker 9:          01:02:51       my mother. My father, Ms Dot my family. What are you doing? Um, I was born to swim the open seas.

Speaker 7:          01:02:57       All we hear is what if they have the answers to the universe? They know all the answers where we came from, they know everything they, they've been trying to tell us, but they just can't communicate when we don't listen, logged in. They're just, they know all about the Galactic Federation. They know what's going on and go, dude, a comment's going to jack you in three years. You better get on. Father was like ones and Zeros. It was all like modem sounds and we just haven't been able to. People are so. Yeah, right?

Speaker 9:          01:03:29       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:03:30       People are so fucking toxic. We don't just ruin our world. We ruined the ocean world too. We pollute the ocean world and we eat everything that's in there. I mean if you think about the two worlds that exist right next to each other. Okay. There's the world of land and in this world of the ocean, in the world of land, you don't get to fly, but unless you get in tubes and metal and shit like that, but you do get to manipulate matter. You get to use your thumbs and make things and create things. The world of the ocean, you can fly all over the place, but you can't manipulate matter. Well, what happens? Well, the ones who get manipulate matter to figure out a way to make tools and make a vehicles to fly over to where you live and fuck you up. You know what we're doing, we don't think about we are at war with the ocean and we're.

Speaker 1:          01:04:16       We're in a, in an ocean of oxygen. We're just like crabs. We just can't sweat around. We're just the bottom feeders. You know? There's a lot of motherfuckers flying around birds and shit. It's an ocean of oxygen that we're walking around and yeah, but in the, in the ocean, yeah, that's very true. Right? And we are the, the crabs of the outer world, right? Because there are animals. It's not like the water. There's water and then there's oxygen. It's just crap. That's a good point because cramps can't fucking swim. They just stuck there. They're down there to clean things. Hate those fuckers. Cleanup. Stupid. Yeah. That's the when sharks run around Jack and people and a foot falls to the ground. So the crabs, crabs go at it. That football? Yeah, and crabs. Always known for the term crabs in a bucket. Whenever you. You're around people and they're fucking holding each other down. Do people still get cramps but people still getting cramps? That's not still around 70, 79. I don't know. I heard of crabs in years, but I'm sure it's out there. You just gotTa look for it. And then high school they used to say that, dude, I got the crabs. Crabs like the wrong dirty, dirty, dirty bitch. Yeah, hippies.

Speaker 1:          01:05:32       Hippies really can. You have crabs if you shaved your pussy and they've really hard. It's harder. That's probably why girls started shaving their policies. It was always the form checks, right? They gotta do we gotTa fucking shave. So it's like a chemo thing, you know, at first. But then it became cool. Well, you know, there was like a, a run of people who thought it was offensive to ask women to shave their pussies. There was like a big, you know, back in the day when women had bushes. I remember like the debates when it was like porn was starting to alter people's perceptions of what sexual organs could, should look like. And I've read some, some thing about this where they were discussing how, you know, women are upset that their husbands want them to shave their pussies and make it look like the porn girls.

Speaker 1:          01:06:13       You know, that it's offensive and it's objectifying. But now everyone shapes. The only thing about a hairy pussy is, is I used to like, I used to prefer hairy pussies in my early twenties, believe it or not because girls had shaved sometimes if they didn't shave and they have that, that, that roughness. It's like you're fucking sandpaper sometimes, but if they're, if they have like a bush, it's all mushy gushy and machines soft. Right. I wonder why it's there specifically. Do you think that's what it is? It's an eyelash there because people usually fuck missionary and it's to protect that area. No, it's a hair is a good way to send off your sense. Does the hair and then wind blows on the hair and then. Oh, so that's why it's around your asshole. Yep. So you can send out the asshole Sunday up. Apparently farts are aphrodisiacs or when we were cavemen whites.

Speaker 1:          01:07:04       Yep. Because it was awesome that this guy got some food. I like foreign. That motherfucker just ate an elk. A Saber. Tooth tiger. God dammit. Figured out. I take that brontosaurus down. Now he's in my face. Have you heard of Americans? Americans are. Yeah. It's like a fake pube yeah. Yeah. There's a fig pubic hair you can buy like a lot of girls like to do the laser now down there and get all their pubic hair taken away and then they buy Merkins if they ever want pubic hair once. That's crazy. They were like a pubic hair. Tupac. Tupac fashion ones that they use. Who would, who? Japanese. That's my gosh. I have no idea. Oh, it is. No, no, that's what I would say that people at burning man, they like the craziest shit. You know Japanese can't. You're not allowed to show pubic hair. Right? Right. Yeah. Something. They don't shave their fucking pews. How weird is that? I think you're not need the Japanese if you're listening out there, you guys shaved that thing, man. God Damn it. No one likes that. But he would sell so much more porn. Relatively unherald compared to a lot of girls. Very Japanese are hairless, but fuck, all of a sudden it all, you know what it all takes place in the pussy. They don't have enough hair to

Speaker 2:          01:08:16       go around for the legs and the arms and shit. It all. Dude. You haven't seen Japanese porn? I have seen a very little shit. Do you think the Japanese girls are hypersexual?

Speaker 5:          01:08:25       Can I, you know, I think redheads are in. Here's, here's why I've been doing some research. Redheads have thinner skin. They also are very, a lot more sensitive to a lot of things like when you get put out as a ginger, like you have to have more a shit to put you out. Like they, they actually have different. When you go outside you need sunscreen, what you're saying would they have thinner skin and they have a few things that are different than normal people and so they're like overly sensitive, like they bruise easier. They the sunlight shit, but there's also like when they're, when they're in hospitals they have to use more medicine to knock them out too. And it's, it's weird. I don't know a bunch of it like, so you think there are separate species? I think they, they're, they're the closest to being different than, than like Asian people.

Speaker 5:          01:09:12       Really. You think that the Asian Asian people don't have thinner skin than us? They don't have. They're not more sensitive to skin and light. They also like, there's a lot of like if you look at red heads and that true ginger's compared to just a regular white person, there's a lot of differences that you would never even think of for some reason. Really. Yeah. What else? Their eyes are usually more prone to. They have to wear sunglasses. Like it hurts their eyes more than where they supposed to be from or they like northern people don't know. I have no idea.

Speaker 2:          01:09:42       You know what's crazy about Japan? I went there about a year ago, a year and a half ago this last time, but they, they're so down like they're number one obsession as far as girls go. Our school girls in the school, girl outfits, you know this. That's number one, but everybody knows that's crazy. But number two is school girls in French maid outfits, so it's school girl and then French made. They have a bar out. There were 15 year old, 14 year old girls dress up like friends, like they're in the laundry and they're serving ice cream. Like it's totally okay in Japan. It's insane. Those guys are not. I'm serious. It's crazy. They're obsessed with school girls and little girls and French maid outfits and just those two. There's not even a third. It's just, are you fucking backstreet boys? Are you in sync? You got to choose sides, you know,

Speaker 5:          01:10:35       and you have to have tentacles coming out of you. What's all that about? They got some crazy animals. I think it's a loophole to go and get around there. There are laws of insertion of canvases and stuff. Crazy cartoons. Is that pipe before back in the day, Roger. Rabbit kidding me. Come on. Japanese penis porn. That's crazy shit dude. It's like giant digs going through a cig and outer mouth and she's gagging and slavery is everywhere. There's dicks in her hands in each hand. There's loads going all over the place. It's some of the weirdest freaky shit you've ever seen. You can understand girls getting off to it because I knew a girl once who loved

Speaker 2:          01:11:14       it, but I just like cartoons. See real shop, two pluses with all dicks and they're just fucking these crazy school girl looking character. You know, like the final fantasy and you know, find a fancy. It's at CGI. Where they're trying to make it look real. What's the best they've done it with in porn like that? What's the. Is there anything? Yeah, like it'd be too expensive for porn, but initiative used special effects for like those themed ones. Like they had an Avatar theme porn. I'm sure they must have used some sort of special effects. The only ones I've seen are like, they look totally fake, but are there any that look almost real time.

Speaker 4:          01:11:51       This is a waste of money, man. Who the hell is and you don't really need to. I mean, unless there's someone out there that you remember Salami. So we had that movie.

Speaker 2:          01:12:00       No. Yeah, that's right. Okay. Forgot an inside story will be Salami from A. From a Jersey guy. Yeah. Yeah. Bobby up Salami. We call them Salami, but not to be confused with the other Salami. Oh No, no, no, no, no. This is Bobby Salami. He was a pizza maker. Peach mango. Great Guy. People who,

Speaker 4:          01:12:20       well make porn. You know, they, there's, there's that wish that they were legitimate know I'm in. I remember talking to Ron Jeremy a bunch of times at the comedy store and Robinson was telling me, yeah, I got a part in this thing and I'm really excited. I'm trying to go mainstream. And I was like, you're trying to go mainstream mainstream show God damn. And I'm like, Dude, you're Ron fucking Jeremy Man. You're Ron Jeremy. Like not a lot of dudes get to be Ron Jeremy, your ranch. You're a bad motherfucker and you want to be like one of these regular guys on TV. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          01:12:51       Scan. And I was right there when you said that it was in the parking lot at Hollywood and highland. And I was uh, I just wasn't thinking and remember the Dickish. I mean that was the biggest douche. Like when he started saying that it was funny to me. I'm like, and I looked at Joe and I'm like, can you imagine if it actually works? And we see like Ron Jeremy doing like diehard five and he's in a, he's in a wife beater with a gun. Someone's breaking in the house. And I go, whew. Imagine drawn chairman was right there and I started fucking laughing, jealous, like do, don't laugh. I looked at Ron Jeremy, he's not laughing and I'm like, Oh shit. I just talked to mad shit right in front of them. I was, I felt like shit.

Speaker 4:          01:13:27       Didn't realize it. You thought that he would ever sense of humor and that he'd be joking around about it. Like. Because if you said that about Brian or if he said that about joey or send above anybody else. So we know you said that about Ari. Ari would joke around and pretend to be a fucking action hero, but when you say it about a guy who really wants a legitimate career in movies, you know, he was doing something with Roger. Avery's like knocking on the door. Roger Ray. We had some sort of a TV show and he was involved in it right before Roger Avery got arrested for drunk driving. So he was like in with like, he wanted to be a movie star. What if Ron, Jeremy just says, fuck it, you know what? I'm almost 50,

Speaker 2:          01:14:04       whatever the fuck it or whatever. And then he gets into fucking beasel shape if he got

Speaker 4:          01:14:12       into diesel shape, like you just said, fuck it. That would ruin his whole appeal. The whole appeal. Ron. Jeremy, is it Ron Jeremy's and he's just banging the hottest bitches and he'll tell. He'll tell Ya. Know Viagra. I don't use Viagra. I don't believe in it. He will. He won't. He doesn't believe in it. Yeah, he's a savage. The steroids have the porn world. Like everyone denial. They're all in denial, but everybody's doing. And do you know that the NFL is trying to test for human growth hormone now? There was a big thing. I was watching the. I never watched sports shows, but they were talking to the head guy, whoever the fucking head guy the NFL is. And he's like, yeah, well we had. That was a part of the bargaining that we're going to test for human growth hormone, but the players representatives, there's still a.

Speaker 4:          01:14:50       they're still debating the science, the science of testing for human growth hormone. We believe the science is there. And like what? What are you talking about? What are you going to have regular sized people playing football? Can you imagine it works and they totally get steroids out of NFL. It'd be so. So you could be a 190 pounds and fucking play defensive Lineman, Rocky Marciano roll in his grave, 189 pound heavyweight champion of the world. That'd be hope for Mexicans and football. Right now we have one Mexican. That'd be a lot of Mexicans, man. Well, you know, look at Mexican, like Cain Velasquez. He's a rare dude. You know, one of the 240 pounds ultra athlete who moves fast. He fucking moves fast and doubles fastest. Fuck. What if he went to boxing and became the world heavyweight champion in boxing? There's nobody out there. Oh, I bet he could do it.

Speaker 4:          01:15:37       Well, I don't know man, if he'd have to deal with the Klitschkos, you know, but I think he's one of those guys that there's a few guys with their. Their mind is so fucking strong. Their work ethic is so strong and their ability to pull shit off like Cain has got this fucking wicked belief in himself. Man, you could see it in that dude's eyes before he goes out there and fights and he's got that big ink and head, you know what I mean? And he's a fucking super athlete, man. You know, he, he doesn't look like, you know, your standard super athlete. He doesn't have like super low body fat. He doesn't have like a ridiculous six pack and veins everywhere. He doesn't look like a Kevin Randleman. But that's also one of the reasons why the motherfucker never gets tired. That guy never gets tired.

Speaker 4:          01:16:14       He, no one's got conditioning like Cain Velasquez, you know, I think that God could do anything he wants. I think we're, we're, we're lucky to have him as a UFC heavyweight champion, but he would be whatever the fuck you wanted to be. If he wanted to play football, he'd be playing football. If you wanted to play, if you want it to be a heavyweight boxer, he'd be a bad ass fucking heavyweight boxer. That guy's just, he's just a killer. There's certain dudes that are just killer. He should do like the cover of espn, like in a chill outfit. It's just rare that Mexicans are taking this ride with it, go with it. With that, with a baseball cap, with the front flipped all the way up like a suicidal tendency. Dude, you. What do you think about junior dos Santos and Cain Velasquez? First of all, I think how amazing it stop for a second and think of how many Mexicans are fucking bad ass fighters besides me are counting everybody.

Speaker 4:          01:17:00       Youtube along with you, but let's include like the boxers, like Julio Cesar Chavez mean what? That dude epitomized what like a bad ass Mexican boxer was. He would come out to the fucking Mariachi music and he had the flag on his fucking head and he would just Jack People. You know the days of Julio Cesar Chavez? Man, think about all the bad. I mean, it's amazing how many this Victoria t's kid thinking about how many people who are bad ass fires or of Mexican descent, some amazing numbers. Man. I think it's, it's Sarah, the closest third world, Latin country to Vegas. You know, it's the closest one. You know what I mean? You know, because really Mexicans, Guatemalans, El Salvadorians, Colombians felt the same shit. Come on, it's all there. Just closest. They're just the closest one in Las Vegas and La. But you know, I'd love Mexico. I'm Mexican in case you guys were all pissed off, but you know, there's those borders out there.

Speaker 4:          01:18:01       It's all the same shit come on. It is. But the Mexicans figured out, especially in boxing a way to be super fucking successful, you know, I mean, you, you, you can't discount, you know, just say it's just all, it's all the same shit because Mexicans in particular have been really successful at boxing. You know, they, they've, they've brought up some incredible boxers out of Mexico and they have the most loyal fans. The Mexican fans are fucking not nuts. Erik Morales. And when that dude was on top, God damn they go for the most Mexican tick is when Julio Cesar Chavez was at his prime when he fought Oscar de la Hoya. Well, he was actually falling off as a little bit and Oscar Delgado is rising. You had to choose a side you want. They all went with the most Mexican and the Mexican Julio, Cesar Chavez. He couldn't even speak a word of English.

Speaker 4:          01:18:47       He was a beast. Yeah, he was a fucking beast. He would just body punch the fucking shit out of you who just stay on top of you until you eventually just broke you. I was a giant boxing fan before the UFC. I was like, I was just a fanatic with boxing because I was for mma and UFC and I loved them both. I saw Oscar de la Hoya, his first pro fight at the La Forum. I was a huge fan, but I had to make a choice. Fuck, I chose. I chose Julio. Cesar Chavez. I went to see a Berrera fight live. I saw him fight live. It was in la somewhere. I want to say it's a stable center, but it might've been before the staples center even existed. I don't know where the fuck I saw him, but uh, I saw him fight some other dudes, some black dude that was pretty good.

Speaker 4:          01:19:26       But Berrera beat his ass and he, we were all hanging out with Mexicans. It's me and my friend Terry clay bond as a boxing coach and we're all watching this date. They were going fucking bananas when Barrera was going off. They were going fucking bananas. It's boxing is. That's when the racism just fucking comes out and it's okay. It's okay to be racist if there's boxing going on because when I met anytime of Mexican fought, anybody else I was. I always went for the Mexican. Even if it wasn't Mexican, if he was Honduran and he was fighting a white guy, I'm going with a Latin guy. That's the closest thing to Mexico. I was. It was okay with my best friend growing up. James. He was black. We were both into boxing. He always went for the black guy. I always went for the Mexican guy, always.

Speaker 4:          01:20:07       He never went for the Mexican guy and I went for the black guy that would and it was okay. It was, but NMA job. Totally different. I can in MMA, I can care less if the guys Mexican, what I like. Style style is way thicker than blood. I'm a Jujitsu guy. I'm always going. I'm always pulling for the Jujitsu guys, always. I don't care if it's a black Jujitsu guy against a kick boxer from Mexico from where my mom was born. Like, fuck you, I'm going for the Black Jujitsu guy. It's always Jujitsu style. You have to think that your Jujitsu instructor, it's styles way thicker than blood, but boxing shit is. A lot of people think that I pulled for Jujitsu guys, man, but most of my favorite fighters are strikers. You know, I pull for a pool for extra extraordinary talent. That's what I pulled for.

Speaker 4:          01:20:56       I don't pull for like individuals, you know, I pull, I want to. I want to see some crazy shit. You know? Even if it's a guy who I thought was really good before, then all of a sudden they pull something off. It's amazing. It makes you look at them differently. That's what my, that's my favorite shit. I like watching two guys push it off. I just watched like watching guys improve. Guys that are really good. You know, I like just the best submission guys. Those are always my friend Aoki. He's always like that too. But I still like watching Anderson man. I like watching it. You can't deny that. I definitely. I love knockouts. Who Doesn't love a great knockout. I love that shit too. But I'm always pulling for cool new submissions because there's so much room for improvement and Jitsu and mma. There's so much room.

Speaker 4:          01:21:39       It's still at its infancy. You know, there's something special to me. I mean it's sounds kind of fucked up, but there's something special to me when a guy has reached the extraordinary heights that like Anderson Silva has that word and he's standing right in front of you. Chanel calming, standing right in front of him with his hands down, his fist balled up, and you just realize like, this poor fucking mouse is in a box with a Cobra and it's going to get jacked up. It's going to get jacked. You realize that you was trapped in there with Anderson Silva. It wasn't. He was no longer competitive. There was a moment after he had kicked him at the end of the first round, he fucking blasting and with a headache. And from that moment on you, she was not competitive. He was, Anderson knew it too. There's no way you take one of those head kicks and be okay.

Speaker 4:          01:22:22       I mean you might look okay, you fall down, you get back up, you look okay, but your shit is done. You know, Anderson just got in front of them and started moving around on him and it was just when you watch someone have that skill level, man, I don't care what they're doing, if they're doing boxing, if they're doing Jujitsu, if they're just kickboxing. I just, that's what I like. I like watching someone is just hitting those rare heights. How about t j grant pulling guard with a good team. Dude pops his head out and switches to that beautiful and oh, it was amazing. Even though there's controversy, you know, that he, you know, he didn't tap it all that. There's some controversy there though. But the fact that tj grant was so confident in his guard that he pulled guard with a good team because a lot of guys don't like pulling guard with a good thing because if, if the guy pops his

Speaker 2:          01:23:06       head out and, and, and he gets out of the good, oh you're on your back and he's on top. But when clearly did it in a sequence, the guy was defending with his left arm and he knew he was going to get that arm. He knew it. And as the guys defending shit, it lets it go and goes to the arm bar. He was so confident of. So few fighters are. They're just not confident I'll fighting off their backs. You know, there's so many Brazilian black belts out there moon our champion too. They just refused to pull guard. They don't, they don't feel like, you know, I don't know what they're thinking, but to me it just seems like they don't have enough confidence in the guard had been doing Jujitsu for a long time. And it's refreshing to see someone like Tj grants. Like, you know what?

Speaker 2:          01:23:44       I'm having trouble taking this guy down. Let me just pull guard and attack off my back. Well, he almost got him with an arm bar and the, uh, the first round he had locked up an arm bar and went belly down at the very last second. So the first roundup, he's a beast man at one thing that kids a killer t j grant. I knew he was talented when I first used fought real tony and his UFC debut. That's a tough fight for UFC debut. Anyone want a decision? I'm like, this fucking kids. How about Paul Sas? He hasn't fought in like a year and he's like, the first I've ever heard of Paul Sassy was finding on the undercard in an England show over a year ago. And it was a headline on the underground and said the headline was I'd like to fall up, fight off my back. I'm like, you never have seen that as a headline for a fighter in some interview.

Speaker 2:          01:24:29       I liked to fight off. My back is so dangerous. Offers back. And then I'm like, wow, let me watch this guy. I go, this guy pulls guard. So his in the fight a year and a half ago in England, he pulled, he shoots, pulls, guard, attacks off his back. The guy stands up, pulls away, runs away. They stand up again still first round, he shoots deep, makes the guy sprawl, pulls guard, attack some. The guy pulls out of Inova bladder or triangle. They go again. Third time he shoots, pulls, guard, goes after like a leg lock. He just misses it. Bam. Or something like that. Instill in the first round. He shot again for a fourth time shot the dude sprawled. He pulled guard and then he got them. He got them like there's a guy out there named Paul Sas who so confident on fighting his back and he's people don't want anything to do with his guard.

Speaker 2:          01:25:17       He sits on his ass and says, come on, get on top. I'm spotting you. I'm good. I'm spotting. You guys will refuse to get in his guard. You would think. They're like, damn, this guy is going to go on his back. I'm just gonna. Go on top and just mash them. I can't believe he's just submitting and just going on his back. His guard is so dangerous guys. The hard part is getting guys to agree to get into his guard. That's unique. That's fascinating to me. I love seeing that. Paul says, Tj Grant, man, I'm huge fans of those guys. Well, what what it is is that people are realizing that there's a level that's possible to achieve that hasn't been demonstrated yet and there's a lot of those people in straight Jujitsu and there's a lot of those people in the street submission grappling, but in an mma when you add in all the other things, we haven't seen anybody pull it off.

Speaker 4:          01:26:04       We haven't ever ever seen like the way Marcello Garcia went through all those competitors in Abu Dhabi in 2003 when we first saw Marcello in person. I'll be like, this guy is like a speed demon. The way he was going through people like the banality to his technique was so clean. Yeah, but that's. You know, it's a different world when you add in wrestling and when you add in punching and you had a nice and kicks and this is a different world. We haven't quite seen someone hit those heights of submission. We're starting to see it though. There are. There are a handful of fighters that have zero problem pulling guard and Vinny Maga classes. One he used to fight in the UFC. He wasn't one of the seasons of tough. He pulls guard like he doesn't mind. His guard is so dangerous that he will pull garden and attack you and you know that again, there's Paul Sassy.

Speaker 4:          01:26:51       Paul South fought last week. He did the exact same thing. He pulled guard guy pulled out of an arm bar or a triangle and then you switch it to a leg lock. It was a beautiful leg lock. So um, and then like Aoki will pull guard anytime. But you see Matt Wyman and Mac Dancer. That was amazing. I had, why am I got Mac dancing and a fucking serious arm bar. He didn't tap him, but I'm like whoa. That was quick. He had hit a nice arm bar for his back. If Mac Danzig didn't have such good defense, he woulda got that. We're starting to see more and more fighters beat active once they get put on their back, like if they got put on their back and they didn't want to be there. Like Miguel Torres, if he gets put on his back, he will attack. You just not going to sit there.

Speaker 4:          01:27:30       Havi Vasquez. He's just not going to sit there. He says he's going to attack you. And then the, you know, and then you got guys like, uh, you know, rumble Johnson who wants to be on top of rumble. Johnson had a guard to rumbled, Johnson's frightening. And you see that fight with Charlie Brennan. He's terrifying. His eyes look orange. I wonder if he's wearing contacts. He's had surgery on his eyes. Is that what it is? Poked. He got poked really bad by Kevin Burns. Remember Kevin Burns could not close his lefthand. Kevin Burns broke his left hand so many times that he literally couldn't close it. So he would like Paul with his left and then throw his right and he poked the fucking shit out of his eyes. Anthony Johnson's a Jesus. He's scary. He's a, he's a true super athlete. You know, he's a, first of all the idea that that guy can get the 70.

Speaker 4:          01:28:17       It's like it defies logic defies. It defies reason. You know, you look at them and you go, you see them in between fights. Like that's a heavyweight, that's a goddamn heavyweight. And then somehow or another it makes one 70 and he looks fucking great the day of whatever he's doing and he's doing it right. You know, I just wonder if it takes so much out of him that it would. I mean, I think what he does at one 70, he could probably do it one 85 to. I think he might even feel better if it was doing it at 1:35, you might feel healthier. You know, I, I don't know. I mean I'm only just taking wild stabs at it. [inaudible] I don't think it's so good to cut that much weight for so long. I think it's terrible for your body, but whatever the fuck he's doing, man, when he gets in there, man, very few guys move as quick as that guy does.

Speaker 4:          01:28:58       Very few guys, when he's like, when we were siting Charlie Brennan, you know, he didn't respect Brennaman standup that much. She was worried about his wrestling, but he knew that he had a big standup advantage. You could tell he was in the confidence that he had when he moved forward and I was watching. I was like, that is terrifying. That guy, when he's confident, when he's confident and he's. He's real, real short is going to tag you. Like he was the finals of tough when he fought that Tommy spirits kid, when he's real confident that his standup is way better than you. He's so dangerous. He's one of the scariest guys at one 70. Even scarier than Tiago thiago. Alves is probably the best technical striker, but Anthony Johnson, when he gets you hurt, he's the scariest guy. He's a scariest. He's, I think he's got like a gnarly potential.

Speaker 4:          01:29:39       You know, I think what you've seen now, it's like, that guy's going to get better. He's getting better already. He's just, he's just a freak, fucking awesome athlete. You know, that's racialist. No, that's just reality, man. If he was white, I'd say the same goddamn thing. Whatever he's doing, he's doing awesome. I mean there's, you know, it's hard work and discipline for sure. Go into all any recipe for success. But that guy is a, he's a special athlete. He's, he's built the fuck people up. You know, this is a good sport for him. You know, there's certain guys like John Jones always says that he can't fucking throw a football. He's not, he's not good at basketball. You can't dunk, but Goddamn as he designed perfect for mma, you know, Jon Jones has the literally the perfect frame. You know, that that's the. If you look at all the people that are fighting right now and all the different equations, you know, how would you get to this guy?

Speaker 4:          01:30:29       How would you beat that guy? What are you going to do? You get to John Jones, you go, damn, good luck. And I love the fact that the navy, and I'm not a striker, like I said, I'm a fan of striking. It was a big boxing fan. I love that. More and more fighters are starting to implement taekwondo and Kung Fu kinks. I love that. You know, and guys like John Jones and Anderson Silva, they're doing Kung Fu there. They're throwing wing Chung kicks, that taekwondo kicks and that one got 45 does it. Dustin Dennis, the guy was just an awesome kicker. Dustin Dennis Doonas, I'm sure. Yeah, he's at 45. He fought hoodie fine. He Find Florian. Kenny Florian. Oh, Diego Nunez. Diego knew he's a sales guy. Watch him over one young guy. Yeah. That guy can kick. He's got great kick Nova and Y'all guys married. A lot of those guys are wicked kickers.

Speaker 4:          01:31:28       I would say a good 80 percent, 85 percent of of MMA fighters today are just throwing the basic, you know, tight leg kick and then a head kick. Occasionally. Maybe a spinning back kick or something. I love guys to just throw it all, throw it all. Well, usually those guys have a taekwondo or karate background because in in, in normal mma training, man, it's way harder to teach someone how to throw a sidekick then as how to teach them and throw a round kick. Yeah. I could teach you to throw a low kick and throw it correctly in a couple of and in any normal athlete football player, a baseball player, any normal athlete can perform that, but if I say or I do a, we'll kick. I want you to do a. we'll kick with power like Jesus Christ. That takes a long time to learn it. If you're.

Speaker 4:          01:32:12       Even. If you're a super athlete, it's going to take a while to pick up. Let Jon Jones is throwing it. Well, of course with John Jones, he's training for quite awhile now. What I'm saying is it's like it's not easy to pick up those certain techniques like sidekicks. That's the. John's got a wicked sidekick now too, man. It's got a front leg. Scientificky hops forward to he. He was throwing, Spinning back X. He. He threw a hopping sidekick against the cage and they'll just a warm up. Like I was using warming up and I'm like, Whoa, he's doing it perfectly. Knee up high, turning the hip. [inaudible] pretty much proved that you know, all of those Kung Fu kicks or to work Connolly's got the best threesixty turning side kick in the game, you know, and that's one of his sidekicks or one of the things that makes his fight with vandelay so interesting because when American kickboxer started fighting tie fighters, they found two things out.

Speaker 4:          01:33:02       The one they found out how difficult it is to deal with leg kicks. They were getting fucked up by leg kicks, but guys like Don Wilson, who was a he, he learned leg kicks early on and he fought a lot of leg kick fights. He realized how good the front leg side kick was. The front leg roundhouse kick it kicks it. The ties weren't that good at ties would throw the team, but they would get close enough to each other. Jack each other's legs. And when you fight that style, where you kick the legs, you don't necessarily develop the techniques like the karate techniques, because the chronic techniques, a lot of them, when you're coming up through the ranks, they kind of get shut down. But you know by a lot of the Thai techniques. But if you learn karate before you learn more tie, then you have all that crazy dexterity for acs kicks, we'll kicks and all that shit.

Speaker 4:          01:33:46       That may be one work as well. If guys were kicking your legs so you might have a more conservative game. You know, some guys that come up through the taekwondo ranks, those are the ones who do wild, crazy shit because you can't get punched in the face and taekwondo tournament. So those guys, when those guys get into Moitai, that's Diego Nunez. That's Anderson Silva. That's also Edson Barboza. They got all that shit in their back pocket. Yeah, that Edson Barboza Guy. So you would say you would say that it's for kids. They're dreaming about being UFC champions to do some taekwondo for a few years just to get, get all that. The crazy kicks down. And stay balanced and maybe not even do taekwondo by itself, but incorporate a couple of days of taekwondo training into your training, like say if you were a new kid and you were trying to become an mma fighter, what you should do is at least one day a week work on kicks because one of the things you could do by working on these wild kicks is forget about the sparring, forget whatever. Then you just want to work on a technique and a kick and learn how to kick things. Learn how to stretch out that front leg side kick learned to wheelchair, learn the ax kick. Once you do it, if you do it with someone who's really good at it, you see like the high level techniques you see when someone and then that's what you mirror and your mind and that's what you try to recreate

Speaker 3:          01:34:58       and that's how you get really good at those things. When you add in kicks, a lot of those techniques go out the window. When you add in punches, a lot of those leg kicks, excuse me, allows techniques go out the window. You add in punches, a lot of those techniques go out the window. You had to take downs. A lot of those techniques go go out the window in less, you know how to check kicks, block takedowns, and you have good boxing, so you have to have all those other things. Then you can use the taekwondo again because then you have all these other techniques. Then it's just another tool for the arsenal, but unless you have a fully rounded game, those tools become problems like the kicks. You rely on them too much and you drop your hands. You get punched in the face because you're not used to being punched in the face, so you have to develop good, good timing and distance for punches as well as kicks.

Speaker 3:          01:35:43       You have to change your game, but once you do change your game, so that's the beauty of adding it in as like one day a week or two days a week where you just constantly work on only those techniques. Then you're doing all that other stuff too, so you might actually be able to pull them off. I think eventually what we're going to have to have is there's going to be like a system, you know, when they train football players, you know, and they, they, they don't just just take a lucky guess like, today we're going to do this, you know, well, I don't know that it's going to help you, but today I want you to chop wood with an ax. You know, today, maybe it'll help if you pick up bags of sand, you know, that. No, they don't do that. They, they know what the fuck they're doing when they're training football players, they know what they're doing when they're preparing plays, they know what they're doing.

Speaker 3:          01:36:24       You know when, when guys are, you know, they're monitoring guys performances and measuring their time, their distance, you know, when they're running the 40 are running 100. They were there trying to figure out what is the, what's the best way to optimize athleticism. The eventually that's going to happen and it's going to be a scientific approach to mma training. And there's gonna be a bunch of different approaches. You know, everyone's gonna have their own little style to do it, but there's gonna. It's going to get to a point where we know exactly how many hours you're supposed to train in a day before. It's detrimental. We know that even though you can do it, you know, five hours a day, you shouldn't do it five hours a day. It fucks you up. We know what's the right amount, what is the exact program you should be on as far as striking, what does he, what are the exact lessons you should be learning every day because that's how it should be treated.

Speaker 3:          01:37:07       It should be treated as something you're trying to develop like a project you're developing and it should be micromanage. You should manage every single aspect of it. You should manage all the hold. You should objective, analyze all the different techniques, all your vulnerabilities and sparring. Would body types, give you problems, all that shit. It has to be treated like a science in order to really truly optimize it. Then you add in creativity and you know the ability to improvise, improvise, and the ability to fight hard and the ability to be disciplined and get in shape, but eventually we're going to get to that point where people are getting so good like these rory Mcdonald's of the world, these young kids that are coming up, they're so fucking good. You see them improving every time you see them, they're way better. You're like, wow. Eventually it's going to be. It's going to have to be down to a science because you're going to deal with the. The abilities that people are going to have are going to be so fucking high

Speaker 4:          01:37:56       level. You know at the very top we're going to see guys that we can't even imagine because we haven't seen them yet. We haven't. We're going to look back on even like Vito Belfort or guys of this era that are devastating. We're going to look back on them and say, boy, but if they fought the guise of 2030, they'd probably get fucked up. You know the same way people look at Rocky Marciano and go, what the fuck is Rocky Marciano? And you're going to do the Vitaly Klitschko fatality Klitschko seven feet fucking tall is he's got a telephone pole for a job and it would just blast that poor little dude in the head all day until he fell unconscious. No, and that's what we're going to look back on. Now. We're going to look back on it. The greats like GSP. We're going to look back on him. Now, one day, you know in the future where there's going to be some super fucking freak athlete who you think would probably beat GSP fairly easily.

Speaker 4:          01:38:43       It's gonna Happen, man. It's going to happen in all the way classes were in the middle of the fucking stream right now. We haven't even come close to the dam. We're not even close to the full limits of human potential. You think about the kind of freak athletes that they have in basketball. We wait until those all guys, those all start fighting MMA fights. Think about some of the amazing specimens that choose to play baseball because they're good sprinters and they could run around, uh, the, uh, the, uh, the, the basis real quickly, what if those guys decided to start fighting, you know, those are the, those are the real freak athletes. Like I was telling you. I mean, I've been doing Jujitsu a long time and, and when you trained, you get to even a couple of years, you know, if you're going against a wrestler, you know, you role with someone, you're like, damn, did you wrestle, you know, they feel like a whole different person.

Speaker 4:          01:39:29       And you know, after awhile after doing it for 10, 15 years, you get really, really good at gauging someone's strength and you know, kind of guessing what kind of athletic background they had or if they, you know, I brought with soccer players due to the dudes that played soccer their whole life. And I'm like, wow, they got some strong passing strong hips, you know. And a year ago I opened 10 planet Vista and that's, that's, uh, that's in San Diego County. And inside a 10th planet. This, that they have a dance studio too. It's like, you know, in my studio we have pole dancers. Every, every academy has their own little flavor down at Vista they have a break dancing. It's like a new eclectic breakdancing, the combines, Kung Fu, break dancing, yoga, double load of stuff, and it's all based on getting into double load is, it's, it's a trip.

Speaker 4:          01:40:19       So it's like rubber guard, breakdancing. Well there's a group out there, they've been dead for people that don't know Double Lotus for the folks who don't know is like a yoga position where you have one foot and then you wrap the other foot over onto the other needs. Very difficult to get into for the average unflexible person. It's like a super flexible Indian style type thing. Yes, that's good way of putting it. And uh, you know, the school opened and right away other breakdancer started taking Jujitsu and there's one lead. Breakdancers name is Gio. He calls himself freak show and after two months of training he, he goes onto himself freak show that the whole,

Speaker 2:          01:40:53       the whole thing's a freak show. It's like a, it's like a bad name. They're a group freak show. When you roll with them, you're going to feel a little freak show. It's incredibly. It's 145 pounds and after training two months he did the gracie nationals and it looked like, you know, he did beginners division, but it looked like he was sandbag and he was just gone right through. Dude there was incredible and I thought, wow, what's this guy gonna look like in a couple of years? Well, a year, a year later, Sean ballinger is one of my black belt. He is the one who certified that school. He gave him a purple belt after one year. And I'm like, wow, I mean, how good is this guy getting now? So I invited him in all his breakdancers over to headquarters, my school here in La and they, you know, he had a year experience and was already a purple belt.

Speaker 2:          01:41:40       And I'm like, hmm, this guy is like a really is a frequent. Let me see what he feels like. So I rolled with them and it was incredible. I'd never felt, you know, if a guy told me, he wrestled his whole life and he's been doing Jujitsu a year, I would have a way easier time with that guy than I did, especially when he weighs 140, 100, 45 pounds. It was incredible. I've never felt anything like this and even the guys that were on a squad that were training eight months, 10 months size turbo and ozone, that I'd never felt anything like this. It was incredible. It would you say turbo and ozone. So what that mean? That's from the movie breaking. Those were two.

Speaker 2:          01:42:17       So these, these exercises that they do, it's like at all, they're doing one handed handstands getting into flying, double loaded. They're balancing on their head without spinning. You know, the old school break dancers would spin and then they would balance like a top. They just get on their head and their balance is so extraordinary. It's unbelievable. They do like cirque Cirque du Solei stuff. Cirque du Solei is the only time that I can ever remember as a man feeling low. I went with a chick and as I was in the audience watching and I felt inadequate, I felt like I can't do that. These guys like, you know, I, I think of myself as being a guy who was in good shape. I'm fit. I work out all the time and I'm watching these guys move around. I'm like, Whoa, that guy just is doing a one handed handstand.

Speaker 2:          01:43:01       His legs are going that way and he's holding another man up in the air above him. Yeah. Huggies is fucking. It was the craziest thing ever. Like the idea that someone can be that physically strong, they're doing one hand in hand stands and I got this on video, video taped everything, all those guys. It was unbelievable that they get on one hand, handstands, get into flying, double load is and start jumping and hopping. On one hand. It's incredible when you feel like how strong they are and I'm convinced that come, you know, a lot of people separate balance exercises and then core exercises. I think there's something about combining core extreme core training, like they're doing all these handstands and balancing and then combining extreme balance. You put them together. I think that really does create a whole new animal because I've never felt anything like this.

Speaker 2:          01:43:46       It's combining core exercises and extreme balance. At the same time turns your body into something different. It totally makes sense. Something about it, you know, the ability to manipulate your body at an extreme in an extreme way. Yoga alone makes you better at everything you do athletically. It gives you much more control and much more. You know, uh, just you have, you have a finer degree of movement where you can, you can balance yourself better. You have more, but that's way harder than yoga. Yeah, it's, it's incredible. It's extreme yoga because there's a lot of yoga. There's their style is, is a combination of everything they're doing. They're bringing Kung Fu and they're bringing break dance and they're bringing yoga, putting it all together, and like Cirque du Solei. It's incredible. These guys, these guys are incredible. I have seen some break dancers do some wild ass fucking Kung Fu kicks.

Speaker 2:          01:44:45       They call themselves the freak show, man. I've seen breakdancers do those flying flip kicks where they flipped through the air and throw kicks at the same time. Obviously the way I look at is you need a lot more bass in wrestling than you do in Jujitsu and Jujitsu's. The level of basis that's required is not nearly as much as wrestling. Wrestling is all about getting that top position. It's all about balance. It's all about base, but this style of breakdancing requires like 10 times more base than a rustler to do all these crazy things. The base and the balances it's required. It's crazy. So when they come back down and do Jujitsu, like the hardest part in Jujitsu is getting the base and the balance. The movies are actually fairly easy to learn. You could show a nine year old girl a rear naked choke and they could learn it in like five minutes or less.

Speaker 2:          01:45:30       It's the balance and putting it all together and the coordination and the dexterity and man, when they come down. And did you get so once they learned that the basic object of the game and a couple passes, it's extraordinary. It really is. That's amazing. What W, what does that turns out to be the the workout, extreme gymnastics or stream breakdancing. I'm infusing that they're going to be so entertaining. You know what I mean? It's going to be like choreographed. This is the beginning of. This is the beginning of the infusion of this style of exercise into the 10th planet system. I'm definitely. I'm sold. I'm like, I'm at the gym weightlifting. I've been doing Jujitsu for 17 years and I'm doing squats and doing weightlifting. Yes, I'm, I'm. I'm stronger than if I wasn't doing it. But when you roll with a guy that's been doing Jujitsu a year and he just feels any, and I got 20 pounds on him, it's pretty extraordinary.

Speaker 2:          01:46:19       Everybody like respond first told me. He goes, he went down there and did a seminar. He goes, dude, if he rolled that Geo kid yet and I go, no dude, I couldn't get that guy. That guy's watch way to. Well with them. It's incredible and it's not just him. Like I said, the other guys, there were small dudes too that we're been doing Jujitsu eight months, 10 months and yeah, I was getting them, but dude, I was going 100 percent. It should have been really, really easy. It wasn't really easy. That's amazing. It's incredible, man. So I'm. I'm starting already. I'm like, my balance is terrible. I can't do handstands, but I'm practicing

Speaker 3:          01:46:50       against walls. I'm going to slowly infuse that into the system. I'm going to make that my workout. You don't also heard is really good too, is polities. I think someone has a police for grapplers who doesn't want to loiter ones? Dude, dudes have a place for grapplers DVD out or something like that. Hmm. I don't know, but I read something about plays online. There's some athlete. It was looking to do something relaxing in between seasons. He started doing pilates and who's talking about how ridiculously hard it is and people think it's easy because chicks are doing it but polite, especially for a man to carry, you know, carrying a different amount of weight. You know, Palantir is supposed to be super awesome for you. There's a lot of different things you can do. It's amazing how like pliable and developable, developable engineerable the body is. Hey, you can force it to do certain things like, think of like, look, I'm a perfect example, like growing up doing taekwondo and my body's still can do all that crazy shit. You know, even if I took years off, you got to pee.

Speaker 1:          01:47:54       Your body adapts, your body adapting. It fits into a couch perfectly when you talk about, um, about being worried about your health as you get older. Man, why don't you stop smoking cigarettes? Because it's awesome. I love it. It was really that good. So great. Why don't you try cigars that's worse for you? That's like, I don't think seeing all the fucking cancer into your mouth and throat and gums. I don't think it is. I think, um, I think it gives you a little nicotine fix. That's all. Phil Hartman quit. Quit smoking cigarettes or smoking cigars and I go to Jeff's smoke all day. He goes, no, I smoked one or two a day at the most. He just, uh, he just gives you a little fix and then you can slowly wean yourself off of it because what you're really hooked on, according to people online, I don't know if it's true, what you're really hooked on is not just the tobacco, but the 599 additives that the way they've got it engineered.

Speaker 1:          01:48:48       If you can still get tobacco into your system and nicotine into your system, you can slip away from the grips of addiction slowly. They say it takes 10 years off your life though, and it's like, Ah, who cares? Who wants to live the extra 10 years of your life? That's not what it is. It makes, makes. When you're 50, you feel like you're 60, you're 60, you feel like you're 70. It doesn't just take 10 years off your life. It makes you feel really old, shitty. You're, you're, you're cooking your body. Enjoy it. If you like it, you say you love it, enjoy it. Do you take vitamins and try to counteract the cigarettes? Uh, I've been juicing and I've been doing the juice thing. Wake up and do how many cigarettes a day? Pack a whole pack now. God Damn Son, you were only about 10 cigarettes a day for a while, but that was right after I quit when I started back up again. Because when you start back up, you don't go right to the full pack. He slowly go, I'm only smoking 10 a day and then next thing I know you're smoking, you should go and do that Ibogaine Shit. I began for treatment. Does that work for from supposed

Speaker 2:          01:49:47       to be amazing for any addictions? Not all of them. Does their certain pills that have done like it doesn't work on Benzos. Really? Yeah. There's certain things like I for some reason it has something to do with alcohol. Like in Brazil, the people that are part of the IOWASCA religions, they give their kids at 14 Iowasca to prevent them from being an alcoholic. So that's real shit. So would that make sense?

Speaker 3:          01:50:12       Well, I think that's because it's insightful because it lets you see. It lets you experience a deep spiritual connection with the mother earth and then you don't. You don't want to be a fucking loser, you know when you, when you're in the presence of some form of divinity, whatever the fuck the spirit of the Iowa is, whatever it is that when you have that like crazy experience, whatever the fuck you're in, the presence of you, that that presence affects you forever. I mean that's essentially what these people are saying that as John Hopkins University study, it changes their personality. It makes them money.

Speaker 2:          01:50:41       And when you had. I heard that Graham Hancock podcast and when you guys were talking about Iowasca, you guys were talking about how the spirit of Iowasca or whatever it is, is female and you guys were into the, the, whatever you call it, the spirit world or, or whatever that Iowasca dimension is. What do you think that is? Thank

Speaker 3:          01:51:09       you know when you were talking about there's information around us all the time and if we could have goggles that could see all the fucking ones and zero's flying through the air and all the cellular signals and all the Wifi and I think it's very likely that we are just at a stop on the dial and that the reality of infinity is that there is a unlimited number of frequencies to tune into and it's not as simple as you know, we live in one. I mean we know according to quantum physicists and I don't understand it, but I'll repeat what they say is that there are 11 dimensions, 11 known dimensions, provable somehow or another by some mathematics that I'll never understand. So if that's the case, what does that mean? If we know that we have time and space and we know that the basic dimensions that we're comfortable with, what the fuck are these other ones?

Speaker 3:          01:51:57       What the fuck is what? What is, what are those and how do we know that this is just one sort of discovery on the way to discovering that, oh no, this is a part of another fractal and there are infinite numbers of different dimensions because that to me seems just as likely as it's more than one. I have a feeling that there's just an unlimited number of them, but we exist in one dimension. We don't understand the other ones. We can't tune into them and part of our brain can and part of our brain, Ken, when we sleep and part of our brain can and we think of we think of traveling as a physical act of moving your tissue and your cells and your bones from one space to another space, but that's silly. What the fuck is imagination? What are thoughts? What are ideas?

Speaker 3:          01:52:42       What are language? These are all things that are in the air. These are all things that travel from people to people in the air, but they create things and things become of them and in empires get built because of using words and all this stuff comes from the human imagination and the human imagination is what tunes in when you're sleeping and it's where all these psychedelic compounds that are all created by your own body. They'd all interacts with all that shit and that's how things get done and that is why there is creativity that that is the source of all of it. The human imagination, the human mind is the source of all this craziness that we say good and bad

Speaker 2:          01:53:19       based on all that, like all that craziness. What do you think? What would you guess? Like, I think it's another. When you die, what do you think happened? I think you'd go right to that DMT world, man. You think your soul is eternal triggered guessing, but if you. If you had to, if you had to guess, you would think the soul is eternal. This is what I think

Speaker 3:          01:53:36       the idea of you dis. It just stops, stops it ends. I think the only reason why you and I or I and all of us, anybody listening, the only reason why we think of ourselves as one is because of our ego and it's because of our desire to protect our biology and to breed. We are. We are programmed to seek out a breeding partner and reproduce. It's all natural and it's all chemical and then there's all sorts of roles that we play in society to ensure that the best genetics and the ones that are moving forward the most are the ones that get to breed the most and it's all like simple and scientific and it all seems to me to be a part of some sort of an engineered system, an engineered system that's guaranteed to produce certain certain

Speaker 2:          01:54:20       results. You know, bacteria, they have their job in. You know, every cell has its job, but they don't really. They're not really. You wouldn't think the bacteria is conscious of what it's doing to our bodies. It's very important. Do you think like in this dimension, we're going around with their own lives, watching tv, doing our own thing, but on the other side, in another dimension, what we're doing, our our energy, our frequency is important to what is going on the other side.

Speaker 3:          01:54:50       We might be a cold, we might be a cold for another dimension. Yeah, that's what we might be. We might be the negative energy that creeps through the cracks and Fox with their world because we're polluting our.

Speaker 2:          01:55:02       That's. It just sounds like super old drug. Crazy sophisticated and complicated and so complex. Well organized, you know, it's just like. It's sounds very intelligent, doesn't it? Well, I don't. I wouldn't say intelligent, but I would definitely say it follows a very specific direction, you know? I mean whether or not it's aware of that direction is another question entirely and I think that that's really debatable. I think that I don't think fucking caterpillars aware that it's going to become a butterfly and I don't think a human being isn't necessarily aware of why the fuck all what all we're doing is we're moving towards a certain direction knowing we're not knowing it, so I wouldn't say it's intelligent. I would say it's a direction. It's a very specific direction. The only time

Speaker 3:          01:55:44       I feel like a contact with intelligence, like real divine intelligence is psychedelic experiences. Those are the only time I feel humbled by something. What however the fuck it is way smarter than me, even if it's just some sort of a chemical reaction in my mind. Boy, the ultimate wisdom displayed by that chemical reaction is not just tangible, but it it. You carry it with you the rest of your life. You carry those thoughts and what you've learned from those experiences the rest of your life, and that's what they found is John Hopkins study on Siliciden mushrooms and that's what you've experienced in your life. That's what I've experienced in my life. You can't tell me it's not happening that way. You, you're, you're tuning into some other. In incredible intelligence. And you're going, oh, okay. Like I was taking myself seriously. I was being ridiculous. I was thinking that was important. I was thinking I was special. I was thinking I was, you know, I was right. And everyone's wrong. Like Whoa, you don't know Jack Shit and you have a few of those and you feel that I had this crazy dream a couple of weeks ago.

Speaker 2:          01:56:37       Uh, I, I was, me and my girlfriend were at the house I grew up in and she's in the back yard screaming. It's nighttime. It's, it's late at night. She's screaming, come back here, come back here. And I felt like something was wrong with the baby or something. So I run out in the, in the, in the backyard and she's looking up at the sky and then I look up in the sky and then you see all these intelligent shooting stars like, like it was full disclosure. It's like all these low beams of light, like with Algorithms and equations and chem trails in this fancy hand writing and chem trails in like hieroglyphics and all the answers. And we're just standing there going, shit, all the equations, it just came out like, what, what, what the hell on what were you on? I was dreaming. But what?

Speaker 2:          01:57:25       Did you take anything before you went to bed? No, not. I mean I smoked weed but I didn't take Alpha brain. Eddie will give you a crazy lucid dream alpha brain commercial right there. And Alpha brain gives you crazy lucid cut that shit. And Howard, will you take an Alpha brand when you have that? No, I've been taking. I want you to have an extra bottle of wine. I want. I want your honest, unbiased opinion about. Definitely. Definitely. Definitely. So what, what would fucking happen if like there was just full disclosure, like you just hear like aliens from the next star system just said, okay, this is what's going down. You've been part of this, you know, breeding or, or whatever. You're part of this galactic federation. It's 2012, this is what's going on. And the whole history of us was just thrust upon us. Well imagine if our entire civilization was just the interstellar version of seaworld were seaworld for aliens. Exactly, so you find this out and they tell you, they tell you, I'm not only want to get into it because it's just you don't want to get into it. What do you mean? No, it's just I don't want to get into it, but it just, man, what? What's going to happen will happen eventually. You said you don't want to get into it. That's

Speaker 4:          01:58:42       a long story. This guy came in the room and he started taking off his clothes and I started slowly. Secondly, how would people react if, because if the entire truth, what if it wasn't even aliens? What if like our government said, okay, this is what's going on. This is the history of the solar system is the history of the Galactic Federation. We're actually part of this giant federation. We were just left alone for a few hundred thousand years to get to a certain point. Now we're part of this. Now we need to move everybody to another planet because asteroids coming, so we need to get on some fucking God damn ships and you know what I mean? Like, could you imagine if [inaudible] actually came from the ocean? What if they all come from the ocean? What if we don't know it? Use teligent. There's an intelligent species that is like way older than us that figured out the best way to exist is to dig trenches deep into the ocean.

Speaker 4:          01:59:33       They have these deep underwater civilization so they're completely cut off from all the rest of the fish and all the wildlife, so they got completely removed from the food chain, much like we did by not living in the jungles and we moved in the cities. They just built these fucking things down under ground and they became super sophisticated and they control their environment like no other animal in the ocean and they built fucking ships and shoot those ships out. Another actually octopus and all the octopus that we see, the ones that got away with spongebob. If something came from another planet, if something was so smart that it came from another planet, you would think that it would be able to hide itself. You would think we're going to figure that out before we figure out interplanetary travel. We're going to figure out cloaking because if you pay attention, they're pretty close to clogging.

Speaker 4:          02:00:17       They figured out a way to make a tank that the broadcast something, it projects it on the side of the tank so it looks like the walls behind it. It's fucking crazy shit. It's crazy shit. So they're. They're pretty close to figuring out how to do that and make it look really good because if you think about the first one megapixel camera, I had one dude, it was a brick, was a one megapixel digital camera and it was a brick and now your phone has an eight megapixel camera or more about when they master your thoughts and your dreams and you could sell your dreams and like bad ass dudes that are lucid, lucid dreamers and they create amazing. It's like fuck watching movies like movies or from moving. It's like watching a martial arts movie like you want to mma now. Why are we going to watch Jeff Speakman?

Speaker 4:          02:00:59       Why are we going to watch Steven Seagal? We got the real shit. And then when you start watching real dreams, like you just download them, boom. Here's my shifts, that movie that Juliette Lewis would, if it was a dude was completely crazy and you run, you run the risk of becoming crazy by following his dreams. Like what? There's a few dudes who are just fucking. Their dreams are so awesome. You like, I'll fucking risk it and you want to ride dragons through the fucking cosmos and share. This guy has these ridiculous vivid multicolor sorcerer. When that, when that technology has changed as the Australian shades, it's similar to that. When you got that technology like mastering your thoughts and your dreams into DVD

Speaker 1:          02:01:40       combined with virtual reality technology, we're now you could get inside someone else's dream and then they'll do real time like, like Web Cam Dreams, like you go into their dreams as they're dreaming. Whether I should on that. I was talking about from Gizmodo where they recorded the dreams. That's very close to that. Well, you know it's going to be. They've already done it. When they have. I want to see what the fuck that looks like. What about when they figured out a way to actually force you to dream? What if they figured out a way to trigger dreaming or if they figure out a way to somehow or another they activate something in your mind and whatever chemicals that are released in whatever situation becomes artificial, like instantaneous, you know, they can make you dream. See, this video is showing what they recorded from some from brain activity on the right side while they're watching it.

Speaker 1:          02:02:31       Well, the image of the fucking guy on the right side is what the brain is seeing on the left side is what the person's watch and that. That's incredible. It's insane. It's on Gizmodo. It's under A. There's a lot of people that are worried about this. Gizmodo, scientists reconstruct brains visions into digital video and that's a lot of people are worried about this, worried about this ultimate conversion of people in machine and then it's happening way quicker than we think it is. You know when, when when you look up and you realize that stuff like that has taken place right under your nose and you didn't know about it. They're like, oh my God, like what is next? What is next? Somehow or another we're going to be able to read each other's minds. We're going to go right into each other's brains and we're all going to become one organism.

Speaker 1:          02:03:17       We're going to really recognize ourselves as one and talking is going to be fucking for, for idiots. Just going to be telepathy, telepathy, one-on-one. They're going to run into people that still talk. We're going to be like Shannon ahead of them living in the bush. In Australia, we like talking my and that all people, but without any facial expressions, you just laughing your head and that's the time we could talk to the dolphins and the animals. I be Dr doolittle. Do you think that's what aliens stand for? The archetype of the alien with the big giant head and the big eyes and the the, the emotionless face, all that emotion outside is all just necessarily only because we're shitty at communicating and once we were able to communicate completely through the mind will need anything anymore out there. So what do you think that represents? It represents are inevitable.

Speaker 1:          02:04:01       Future are encoded end. It's gotta be. I wonder if that's just the way it goes. Technology marches on and it makes staggering pace if you look at us compared to champs, right? I mean, we're not done. This is very, it's very clear that human beings are some sort of a work in progress. And if you look at us compared to chimps, the big mystery in, in the fossil record is the doubling of the human brain size that it doubled over a period of 2 million years. And they don't know why. They didn't know what it was. But beyond that, the old days, no, they were, they wouldn't tell I'm. It was too. So they, um, if you

Speaker 4:          02:04:38       think about what, what we became from the monkey origin, the original, you know, lower prime, what we became with our bigger head, well if it's going to keep moving in that same direction were going to have big giant heads. And if you look at the muscles that are on champs and then you look at a scrawny ass average American male who doesn't exercise and just works on a fucking in a cubicle all day, they're there. They're scrawny body is very much like the scrawny body of an alien, so if you keep going in that direction, that's exactly what they come out like. You come out like some fucking giant brainiac with little twig limbs that can't get anything done, no Jujitsu at all, no everything you've ever happened you can get with without a facial expression and let that a sound without a peep. You can get all that.

Speaker 4:          02:05:21       You have so much fun just in your head. You just go into other people's head and you just like, you know going to go into a trance and you just get all this information and go through all their memories. You look at someone else and go through their child and go, man, I love hanging out with you, but in telepathy, just going through everyone's life window. If that's darkness, you learn to block your thought. It'd be like the best restoration site to Eddie's and just wonder if that's what aliens on a wonder. If aliens have figured out what they are as real things that we're never going to have real evidence about because they don't exist in this dimension and they interdimensional travel, they just figured out how to tune into different dimensions so they can come here, hang for a little while and fucking Vamos, but they do it in a way that almost as undetectable or that our our, our instruments can't really pick up because they're not even from here, so they'll show up as ghosts of disks flying through the sky and we, we barely registered because we're, we're, we're getting is like static.

Speaker 4:          02:06:18       It's like we're watching one station on TV and it's not quite tuned in and another one comes in and it's in Mexican. That's what we're getting. We're getting like some, some, some bleed over from another dimension and that's what Ufo is our. Does Bob have a twitter? Wouldn't that be cool to have one of your shows? I think he's full of Shit. He might be. He knows a lot. He knows a lot. He's fascinating, but I almost wonder if that guy's working for the government, if he's disinflation agent because he, um, he lied about going to mit. He lied to that shit that's like really traceable, you know, but then he says that, uh, the government, his records, but that's not true because they found school books from people who went to school with him supposedly that were in those classes and there's no bibles are because there's old versions of the mean the west.

Speaker 4:          02:07:02       They went back in time and altered, you know, every single one of the areas that the government is not going to do, that they would get hot. So he didn't say anything like that. Crazy. He said he was like, he said he saw like that could have easily. We already know that there's like German Ufo is, there's probably some American one that he saw, you know, and it doesn't mean that it was alien as kids. We'd like some of US Air Force Ufo. That's not what he's saying though. What he's saying. This is absolutely alien. And the way when they were, they were hired, they were hired to back engineer it. His whole story is, if you don't know who Robert is, Robert was our, is a guy, claimed to have worked

Speaker 3:          02:07:36       for area 51. His story is he had this job there. I became fascinated. He was a scientist and they started helping him. He started helping them work with their. They're they're aliens. They had these or these alien spacecraft that they had and they were trying to reconstruct them, but while this all was going on, what they have to know everything you're doing. So they monitor all your phone calls and they found out that his wife was cheating on him and so they like, oh, this motherfucker is going to be emotionally unstable. We've got to kick them out of the program because he's got turmoil in his life. So they fired him abruptly. He didn't understand why they wouldn't explain to him why they fired him. And so the guy started bringing his friends around to watch the UFOS get launched and that's when he got arrested.

Speaker 3:          02:08:14       And that's when he started telling a story. He started telling a story about how he worked there and they hired him to baggage. It sounds awesome when you listen to them talk and when he does, when he breaks down science and all these equations and using it. I mean, man, he's an amazing liar. If he doesn't know what the fuck he's talking about, but he's gone off with it. He sends some incredible shit about antigravity and all this crazy shit. It almost makes me think that he's a plant and that he's hired to do this because it makes us look silly because when you look into the guy and he says all these fantastic things and then you find out that he actually never really went to mit and he lied about his past and they can't find any record of him anywhere and maybe he worked at Los Alamos for, you know, who the fuck knows what he did there, but he wasn't involved in any area.

Speaker 3:          02:08:57       50 one bullshit. You know, this is of course obviously what the government says with it, but it, it makes him look ridiculous. It makes them look silly. If he lied about where he went to school and so maybe if you wanted to end speculation about, you know, at any particular area whether or not Ufos were there, you have some guy tell some crazy story about it and then make sure that he's full of shit. Make sure he's full of shit about other things. So the people investigate when a fantastical story they have to investigate, you know, and they investigate and they find out that he's full of shit and it makes the whole thing seemed silly, but we know for a fact they, they, they definitely test weapons there and there's videos that people have shot back before they, they, they extended the range of where it's, you're prohibited to travel.

Speaker 3:          02:09:39       They used to be able to get much closer to area 51, but people would go to the certain Ridge and they would film all these different things flying through the air, like the fucking crazy things taken. All these right angle turns in the middle of the sky. And what most people think is that that's where they were initially practicing with drones and that those things that were glowing in the sky, the reason why they look like Ufo shows is like this is the reason why they moved so haphazardly, threw this guy, these roll radio controlled and they really hadn't, didn't have it down yet. And we know now they have drones down to a science, you know. And now the drone technology has gotten to the point. Yeah, they killed that guy, that American born a couple of them I guess lot drones move like they like those lights did a that they captured. I don't know. They seem to think so. They seem to be just like model airplanes.

Speaker 3:          02:10:31       Well let's think about what these drones are for these drones carrying missiles. They will just the weight alone, if you have something that it's, you know, like say if you have something and it's, you're, you're flying around some magnetic device, some new next level antigravity fucking ball of steel. And we figured out how to pilot this thing, but it's not that accurate. It works on magnetic waves when it's all fucking nutty, but it glows and it flies all around. There's no one in it. So can take crazy g force turns in the sky. It's very possible that that's a completely different thing, but that they learn from that and they, they apply specific, you know, things that they learned from that into these other drones to make. But the other drones that they make are often, they're just based on, you know, uh, artificially powered planes, which they've had forever.

Speaker 3:          02:11:17       They've had. And that was the part of operation northwoods. They were going to blow up a drone plane. They already had the ability to launch a fucking plane into the sky just using a remote control. So I think that, uh, it's, it's, it's, it's entirely possible that all that shit that people saw around Nevada, that's like things that the government experiment not, and that you have a guy like Robert Lozar who comes in and says all this crazy shit about Ufo goes and turns out he's a liar. And then it makes the whole idea of Ufo is being there to be nonsense. And then people just want to leave it on.

Speaker 7:          02:11:46       I think it's more of a place where they are. They keep seeds, keep certain. Like animals. Almost like a. yeah, like a civilization. Why do you think that they have to do that the government has to do now? I mean don't you think they have like they've already bought like seeds. Why's that government has already bought like almost every single possible, you know. And that's to keep it, isn't it, to keep it like pure to like always have heard this. Were you getting this information? I don't know. I saw something online about how the government bought all the, all the seeds. So I'll have huge companies. Noah's Ark situation or one company bought all these seeds and they got billions of seeds that they got stored. Yeah, that's like a news they got got Norway to seed storage giant. So they preparing for the end of the. Yeah, I think that's probably what it is. You know, it's like just to be in the middle of the United States currently, Norway has the biggest underground bunkers to over 33 square miles. That's the rumor. Norway's the biggest ticket. How's the rumor? I can house a million. A million for two years. Really? Yep.

Speaker 3:          02:12:55       Well I know there's some place in the palm springs desert. There's some guy, they had them on TV and he was talking about and they've set up apartments there and people buy them a quarter million bucks. And you own an apartment under ground.

Speaker 7:          02:13:06       Oh yeah, they have that. You can find that shit on the Internet. Did abandoned missile silos that they're making like communities and shit and they won't let just anybody. I have a friend who actually looked into it and wants to spend the money. The problem is is you get there how you going to get there when like a fucking tidal wave comes or even if you. Even if you could get there like you bought. There's like the communities that they're building

Speaker 4:          02:13:32       and do you have to have some kind of skill to have to even buy one? Like how are you going to contribute to this community? So you've got to pass all these tests and these interviews. Yeah. And then they take like 50 grand or whatever. Like when Shit goes down and I'm at the front door, are you going to open the Goddamn door for me? You know what I mean? How do I. The only way that would work is if everyone had their own private entrance and you add your own key to it, you know what I mean? But fuck, you open up the door and then the horde of zombies came in behind you and killed everybody in the. Yeah. Yeah. I could totally seem like don't fucking open the door for nobody. Shit went down. Complex is. Remember when you lived. If you ever Linda apartment complex, someone leaves the door open and people get in and break into people's houses and that's what happens.

Speaker 4:          02:14:12       Yeah. Yeah. Like that wouldn't trust that they'll take your money. Now that seems too sketchy. Unless you live in it. Last year a compound guy, like you got a house, like do you remember? Um, I don't know if you heard about this. There was a house in Italy and they suspected this guy of having some sort of an underground military bunker because he had moved a bunch of dirt out of there and it had been years and years of construction and so the Italian government threatened him. They're like, dude, we're going to burn your fucking house down and kill you. Like tell us what the fuck is going on in your basement. Like they were threatened by this guy. Well, they went into his basement and he had this incredible artistically designed temple. There's all different styles of art. When I say artistically designed, it was. It wasn't like by happenstance, they.

Speaker 4:          02:14:52       It was like engineered and plan this huge caverns like thousands and thousands and thousands of square feet and it's like one rooms and Egyptian theme and the other room is in this incredible other beautiful theme. Was he preparing for the end of the world? I don't know what he built this fucking thing under his house. Like he built a whole different world under his house. It's amazing. It's amazing. You know, people are always trying to build things and hide from people because they're worried about the inevitable collapse. Just get a nice spot down in the middle of the earth. Air is pumped up through a straw. It definitely building bigger and bigger bunkers and they're turning into cities. That's just natural. If I had all the, if I was the ruler of the world, I would just have people on the case nonstop. Keep building that shit deeper and deeper and deeper.

Speaker 4:          02:15:35       Keep building it. You know what I mean? Because if you're running shit and you have the power and unlimited resource to build some safety, of course it's natural human behavior. It's the human condition to dig underground and be safe. If you could, if you could have had all the money shit, just literally, if you're doing that though, you literally might be some of the last people on Earth. What a crazy responsibility that would feel if you knew that the whole world got wiped out, but you were inside some fucking thing. And uh, there was a, you know, you, you had a 90 percent chance and once you got out, the radiation had died down enough so that you can survive. You just got it. We got to survive two years under there. If you, if the government came up to and said, Joe, we need you to keep your mouth shut. You and your family can all come back to you. You got to pass. We got the asteroid, the asteroid gets comment, but you just gotTa shut up about it. It's can we just can't see it? Everybody. We can't fit everybody in. You and your family just just

Speaker 7:          02:16:30       pipe down. I never thought of it that way. Like if you just do it, if you were creating wonder who you want to live with, if you were creating a union family,

Speaker 3:          02:16:36       it might be better to just die. It might be better to find out where the asteroid's gonna hit and drive. There

Speaker 7:          02:16:43       might be the movement living underground with a bunch of fucking other second. Naturally where we have that drive we want to live. I hope we're always reaching out no matter what. We're trying to learn responsibility to keep this race going. I never thought about it like involving, if you're creating a noah's Ark, what animals you would eat because you wouldn't do every single animal. You would keep the ones that were the most important, like chickens do nothing but buttons and just ran. It'd be chickens, cows.

Speaker 3:          02:17:09       The idea of being able to actually hold all the animals in one place is ridiculous. However, the idea of being able to hold the genetic information for all the animals in one place is absolutely doable. And so that's what if there was ever a noah's Ark and the real life past of humanity, what it is, probably a DNA bank and that at one point in time, you know, there was a high level of intelligence. That was when the Graham Hancock was on. It was talking about, uh, intelligence, uh, the must have reached very high levels and then got wiped out by some huge natural disaster. And then people were sort of left to fend for themselves and kind of refigure things out. Some things never get figured out again, man. Some people reached a certain direction, a certain level and they reached it in Egypt and you know, and 3000 BC and we still haven't hit that yet. Yeah, that makes sense to me that, that, that makes a lot of sense to me. You know, I don't know that. I mean I know that my genes would want to keep going. I would want to keep going. I wouldn't want to put man. What kind of a life with that being the post apocalyptic life that would suck up. I would definitely do it. I would want to. I would try to live. Yeah, I think I would too. I would to, but fuck it would suck.

Speaker 7:          02:18:18       God Damn. You were just supposed to try to make as many babies as possible. So you just had to find any girl. You candidates come in and just like that. That'd be awesome.

Speaker 3:          02:18:27       Isn't it amazing that our terror terrified world. What's the terror of the terrified world is that we would lose all of this. We lose everything that we can bang on. We could lose a houses and we'd be stuck with just needing to forage for food. He can't go to stores. We don't have trucks and start over. Everything. Start over, start over. We're terrified of starting over. Every other animal starts over every fucking day of the week. We're terrified of it. We, we, we are so connected to devices and inventions and technology that the idea of being alone in nature forever is fucking horrific. That's horrific. That's jail. He'd rather go to jail and get fed four square meals a day and at least if your bunkie he's a good guy, you know, he can play chess together. You know

Speaker 7:          02:19:10       what, if you were allowed, like if the government said, okay, we got one year, this motherfucker is going to hit us. Everybody build your own bunker in the backyard and just everyone just started building. I'll go, you know how you know how rich Mexicans would be? That'd be charged in a lot of money, man. Why?

Speaker 4:          02:19:28       Because that would be the ones doing it. They'd be the ones that'd be charging 150 an hour. They'd want their own bunker man. They'd be like, fuck you, money doesn't mean anything with an asteroid's coming, and they tell you how deep it's gotta be. It's gotta be, you know, they already have their tunnels 30 yards deep. No, it's common. You got one year. Everybody would be digging, man. They'd have instructions. Everyone has their instructions from the government. Build your own shit. You have a year. Could you imagine if you were underground and everyone's locked down and you're all waiting as a countdown and you know that it's supposed to happen within the minute video, cameras, video, cameras. You're in a bunker and underground. You just bump. You're waiting for the impact of the earth.

Speaker 4:          02:20:12       Just feel the whole thing. Could you imagine what you say that the one that killed the dinosaurs, when it hit the earth, it was five miles deep in the first, second and a half, the first, second and a half and went five miles deep into the earth, and these are the same people that measured the brain from that long, from the caveman timer. No regular done. Those totally different types of science. You fuckhead they just talk about how, what an impact that must have been like, you know, and if you were right there, you're fucked. But if you will on the other side and your three mile deep bunker, five miles deep, Yo, you know, I do. How much oxygen would you need for the, you, you'd have to have plants, but would that even work? Could you like have an environment underground where you had plants and you generated electricity so that you could give the light sun, artificial sunlight to the plants and the plants cleaned up the carbon dioxide that you breathed out and gave you oxygen.

Speaker 4:          02:21:11       Would that be possible? Could you develop an environment like that? I don't know. I wonder if they could do that. If they could figure out a way, if there was a, uh, some method of power that they could harness, like say if they had some sort of an underground reactor. So they got this underground reactor and they got this up for the fact that will work for x amount of years and blah, blah blah. And they have a whole artificial world down there. And this reactor runs these lights and it, it, they make it rain on these plants and the plants breathe in, breathe out oxygen, and we breathe out carbon dioxide and they live off that chapter one. Everyone makes their own underground bunker and we've figured out a way like, you know, like we have a power source. It's gonna last for, for two years or whatever. We could communicate with other people on like these walkie talkies and shared. And then you start digging to them and you make like little tunnels to them and shit. Other people try to Jackie with their time. I was like, dude, I don't want you in my life. Do just go back. Boom. Yeah. What happens when they get like rabbits, Jack and tunnels when people's towels cross. Put Gates on your toes.

Speaker 4:          02:22:13       Where does all the poop go? People just show up and tell him, no, dude, I live in a totally gay bars and these guard gated tunnel. That could be crazy. Right? Well, it's possible. It's underground man for breaking into your shit all the time from underneath. Terrible. If the power goes out under there. Oh, what a horrible way to die, you know, you wouldn't have. I wouldn't have a surrender is ready to go for everyone in my family. I'll have a syringe if some shit goes down to shoot that motherfucker, you know, just go to sleep and just fuck it. And on that note, thanks Eddie. We didn't even say your name. Eddie Bravo. We just started talking. I want to be in Montreal in October, late October. I'm going to be a 10th planet Vista. Go to Nibiru, the Nibiru Forum at Tenth Planet J. J Dot Com. All my seminar information's there and thank you very much.

Speaker 4:          02:23:04       What was that? I had a special effect on the song from Montreal coming. You're so silly this Friday. Houston, Texas. The verizon wireless theater. But Brendan Walsh and Joey Diaz were coming. Correct? We're slinging Dick and passing out bubble gum as Joey Diaz would say. Nice. She got to walk on ice. You might as well dance on St Louis in November. Um, Australia. Melbourne in December. I'm going to do with your website. They're not gonna. Remember this? Where's your website? Tenth Planet j Dot j Dot Com. Shizam go to the forum and those if you looking for a place to train legends and Hollywood is where it all goes down. Come to California. Where? Where's the. What's the address? Fifty one 76 Santa Monica Boulevard. It's on the east side of Hollywood. Big Ass gym. We got x poll there. We got pulled dances, we got a Jujitsu. I teach you to Jitsu there. That's 10 planet headquarters.

Speaker 4:          02:23:54       We've got an excellent kickboxing gym. We've got an awesome NMA team. Chris Riley is the MMA coach. He's the head coach for the legends MMA team. It's even has creepy coed locker rooms. Yeah, so one of the real estate. Yeah, it's the weirdest shit of all time and strippers or training, training with the animals. It's done on purpose. The dudes are taken gnarly shit and they get out and girls are waiting to get in there. I have more than one time taking a gnarly shit and then you get out in some poor girls waiting to get in there and the bathroom like. All right, good luck with that. Good luck. We had. We actually, I didn't know this until recently, but we actually have the biggest strip pole class, like we have the longest poles. That's what he said. And uh, I didn't know that. I didn't know we had the most ultimate goal dancing school ensured to the gills from chicks falling on their heads prize.

Speaker 4:          02:24:45       It doesn't happen, but that Anderson Cooper thing, Anderson Cooper's got a new daytime talk show and he had some kid doing some skateboard stunt.
