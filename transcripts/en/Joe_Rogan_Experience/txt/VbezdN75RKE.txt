Speaker 1:          00:00:02       Yes, Gary Clark Jr welcome to the show. Thank you. How are you? I'm great man. I'm great. I owe a Ari Shaffir to connect me to you. He's the one that connected me. Yeah, he, he uh, he goes, check this out. He played a num for me. I go, who is this motherfucker? Yeah. And then from there on, I've been a Gary Clark Jr respect to our, I appreciate it. Yeah, man. What's going on man? Oh Man. Just trying to figure out la I came out here in July and just kind of figuring it out man is not Austin. Not at all. No, not at all. But I'm starting to get a little bit, you know, familiar in Austin's a couple of hours away on an airplane so I can figure it out. Um, but yeah, man, I'm, I'm glad you, you hit me up. Uh, the um, uh, honey honey crew.

Speaker 1:          00:00:51       Yeah, that's the one I like pop that off. So yeah. Yeah. Suzanne connected us. Awesome. They're great. They're good people, man. I love those guys. Yeah. I ran into them at, um, uh, bridge school benefit, uh, Neil young thing. And so it's good to reconnect. First Time I came out here, we did a Gig with them. Oh really? Yeah. So what made you move from Austin, which is like one of the best spots in the world. If you could pull it off to California, which is still one of the best spots in the world if you can pull it off, but so much more complex, much more bullshit. So much marty ego. So much more traffic. So much more actors. Right. That's true, man. That's very true. But um, I spent some time in New York City. I spent my whole life in Austin, always wanting to come out west and we figured out what it's like, you know?

Speaker 1:          00:01:42       And um, so I got the opportunity to do it. So I'm just how you're checking it out being in a few months. Oh, so he's, there was no like specific like pulling reason. You said let me just try La. No, me and my girl just decided we spend some time out here. I like it. I like moves like that, man. I think about doing those all the time. But my wife is so not into that because I moved that bitch at the top of my mountain at one time and she almost fell off the club. Oh, for real drive of the snow dog got killed by a mountain lion. It was a punch of shit happened. Yeah. Be My, I was in heaven. Loved it. Damn. Eh.

Speaker 1:          00:02:19       Speaking of mountain lions, I heard they're like creeping around over here. There's quite a few of them. Yeah. There you can't hunt them in California. So they have no natural predators other than cars. Right. And there's people that think that's a good idea because they keep the deer population in check. There's a good argument for that cause we don't have lyme disease. It's very little lyme disease in California. And one of the reasons for that is, is that not that many deer, especially around here, whereas if you're on the east coast, the east coast right now has a real lyme disease epidemic because these deer overpopulated and overpopulated dear means you don't get enough food and they're more susceptible to disease. And fucking lyme disease is the big one. Ticks these ticks with lyme disease. I know a bunch of people from the east coast that have got lyme disease.

Speaker 1:          00:03:06       It's fucking bad. It's big down in Texas too. There's deer everywhere. Yeah, I guess that's a good thing. But I'd be freaked out if I walked out. You know, most of the time, don't have to worry. Most of the time they're going after cats and dogs and shit like that. They killed a lot of rabbits and small animals and deer. They've decimated the deer population. They kill most of the deer, either coyotes get them or mountain lions get, I'm like, when I see deer in my neighborhood, it's pretty unusual. Whereas if I go back east, like, uh, you know, like I have a buddy lives on a farm in, um, well he owns a farm in Wisconsin, this fucking deer everywhere there. So that's the type of place where you got to worry about ticks. Fuck that. You worried about mountain lines?

Speaker 2:          00:03:47       I mean, uh, anything that could like take a chunk.

Speaker 1:          00:03:51       Yeah. Let me, I'm a little bit worried about what do you live? Uh, I won't say Pacif specifically. Yeah. And live somewhere hilly? No, no, no. Okay. I'll, I'll give you an a flat lands where the people are all, they did kill one in someone's backyard and Santa Monica two years ago. Yeah. Fucking Santa Monica. Do you remember that? It was a big one too. It was like 150 pound cat and some dude's yard just chilling, sleeping in his yard. I can't do that.

Speaker 3:          00:04:20       Talking about something, I was like, I freaked out. I just don't, I just don't fuck with nature of that.

Speaker 1:          00:04:28       You know what I mean? I'm not a, you know, I love that. You know, I, I don't, it's, I respect it, you know, me too. So,

Speaker 2:          00:04:37       um, and you know, I'm not really into getting eaten,

Speaker 3:          00:04:43       but just that phrase, I don't fuck with nature. We have a picture you with a guitar point to get the cabbage and says, I don't fuck with nature. Yeah. Right.

Speaker 1:          00:04:56       Oh Man, I didn't, you know what I mean? I know exactly what you mean. Yeah. It's dangerous man out there in the wilderness and you know, this is a big, cities are great. You don't. People think that somehow or another if you love nature that you don't love cities. I love everything. Cities is this beauty and everything. You can't be close minded. Yeah, I agree.

Speaker 2:          00:05:15       I mean coming from where I'm from, the Austin, this city and in this nice land around it, so I'd like to jump back and forth and be involved in both, but I will not fuck with mountain.

Speaker 3:          00:05:30       I don't mess with sharks.

Speaker 1:          00:05:33       Yeah, I'm down with that. My kids are going to start taking surfing lessons because little five and seven they want to take surfing lesson. I'm like, that's like a bite like one bite. Like you don't even survive if you get bitten by a shark. If you're five you serve. No, I don't fuck with sharks either. That's it. I would share. I would serve the would figure out some sort of bite proof suit for sure. You know, that's what's holding me back. Yeah, that's definitely what's holding me back. I would have a bite proof suit and then I would want a big ass knife strapped to my thigh. So for shark did bite me and it didn't get through. I just fucking fighting as well. The fucker take that. Take it bitch. Yeah. Yeah, I hear Ya. Well there's a lot of them over here too.

Speaker 1:          00:06:19       There's more sharks for sure. Then there are mountain lions, I think. What did I say? For sure if I think, but when you fly over California, like there's a lot of like helicopters that fly over like the Malibu coast. They take video footage of pig has great white sharks all the time that are just a couple of hundred yards away from people surfing. Yeah, no thanks. Thanks. That's a lot of helicopters out here in la in general. Yeah. Wow. Well, because it's a big flat area and there's a lot of criminals. It's a good way to catch people put spot. It's weird when you watch it, you know, they call them ghetto birds. It's weird when you watch him in, the helicopters are flying over and they had a spotlight on somebody. You start feeling guilty. You haven't even done shit. And uh, you know, know I'm particularly sensitive, I would imagine. Yeah. Especially, it wasn't a matter of town what it today. Damn it. How long have you been doing music, man,

Speaker 2:          00:07:13       man? Um, I've been playing guitar since 96. Uh, I always kind of wanted one and my folks were, I had a habit of quitting what I started, you know, like I played baseball for a little bit. I tried to do martial arts for a little bit. I try to do, um, basketball, football and none of it kind of stuck. How would always kind of go back to music. So finally in [inaudible] 96, I just, I got in and quit caring about anything. You know, I got a guitar discovered urban, I was like,

Speaker 1:          00:07:52       and that was about it. Did you take lessons or did you self taught?

Speaker 2:          00:07:57       Um, I didn't take lessons formerly. Like I didn't pay anybody for lessons. My probably should at this point. When my friend of mine, he [inaudible] say she had a guitar and she had a band and she earned, her band would practice all the time. So I would hear him. So I would go over there and check it out and I'll take my guitar and she would show me, you know, like a 12 bar blues, kind of like a Jimmy Reed shuffle type thing or like a power chord, rock and roll thing, whatever. And um, so that was kind of how I first started. And I rented books. I went to the school library and my middle school library and just rented like how to play guitar. Wow. Watch this TV show, Austin city limits that came on, I know Saturday. So I used to just sit there and figure it out, you know, why record the tapes and go back and figure it out.

Speaker 1:          00:08:49       So it was essentially like the first thing that you really connected to that you stuck with. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:08:57       What was it about playing guitar? Uh, I think the thing for me was

Speaker 4:          00:09:05       mmm,

Speaker 2:          00:09:08       I mean I love music and I mean the guitar for me was the instrument that could, it could paint so many different colors. It was very versatile, you know, it can be loud, aggressive. Okay. Be Sweet. Beautiful. Um, and, uh, I just thought if I could get my hands on one of those, I would, you know, try and push it to the limit and, you know, and I really figured it out.

Speaker 4:          00:09:40       MMM.

Speaker 2:          00:09:42       You just play with like the full spectrum. It's different than playing an electric guitar. For me it seemed more there was more options than like a playing drums or playing the trumpet or something. What I mean with toys and you know, yeah. Things like that. So that was it. I don't know, I'm still trying to figure it out. I'm as interested in it, you know, 20 years later as I was, you know, then that means you got the right thing. Yeah, I definitely found it so fortunately that way. That's one of the hardest things for kids, right. When you're a young kid and you don't really know what you want to do with your life and your, your whole future just looks like just confusing sometimes. The hardest thing is finding something that really rings your bell. Finding something. So for you it seems like there was a bunch of different other options. It didn't get groups, didn't really click. And then the guitar just that was it. Yeah. Well, I mean, baseball was a terrible hitter. I was pretty fast. Basketball was tall, but I was stan, so, you know, put me in a post and I would get pushed out by these huge guys and I got tired of my coach going, Goddamn a junior when he got to quit being a bitch.

Speaker 2:          00:10:58       So, uh, you know, it was just just with music, it would just, it just kinda clicked. It was something for me. What martial law should you do? A, I tried to Quanta. Um, yeah. Perfect bill for that. Yeah, I just didn't have the patients at the time. I really didn't. I wish I stuck with it, you know? Um, but I, yeah, I, I didn't have the patience or the discipline. I didn't want to, you know, be focused and I wanted to, you know, there's something out the window, I want to go run and jump out the window, go ride bikes or whatever it was. No, they call that add. But I call that just being a fucking person and curious. Like there's a lot of shit that doesn't occupy your attention and you're supposed to make it occupy your attention. Right. You know? Well you keep yourself pretty busy. Yeah. But like, like guitar obviously occupied your attention.

Speaker 5:          00:11:55       You know what I'm saying? It's like I don't believe in add in a lot of senses and a lot of ways. I think there's obviously some people that have like a mental issue, but I think for most people what they're calling add is being bored. You just bored like school. How fucking boring in school school's terribly boring.

Speaker 2:          00:12:13       Yeah. I was terrible. I was terrible too. I spent a lot of my time. Yeah,

Speaker 5:          00:12:22       you should stay in school kids. A lot of time showing up to that

Speaker 2:          00:12:27       building and then immediately turning back around and going and doing what interested me.

Speaker 5:          00:12:32       Yeah, and look at you now, mother fucker. I'm doing all right. But it's finding that thing and then going after it. That's what it is. And what school does is teaches you that the future is bleak in a lot of ways. Obviously it educates you and obviously for people that that go on to choose some sort of an academic career, it's imperative. Right? But for a lot of people that pushing you to pay attention to shit you don't want to pay attention to, it stifles creativity. It's just not the best way for people to learn. It gives you like this horrible feeling about the future. Like you feel like an outsider.

Speaker 2:          00:13:10       Yeah, I didn't feel comfortable at all. I mean I was constantly trying to figure out what, what, why, why am I spending so much time every day doing this, you know, and uh, I just had other interests. I mean, I, I believe that it does work for some people and, and people need it, but just for me, the type of person that I, that I am, I was just like already know what I want to be doing. I wish I could spend my time doing all the things. Alternative schooling wasn't really an option for me or anything at that point. So, um,

Speaker 5:          00:13:45       is this an Austin you were growing up? I grew up at us in the school system there. It's pretty bad ass. Yeah. It was good. But I felt like I could,

Speaker 2:          00:13:53       you know, I would much rather have four hours in music class and right. Doing something else. So I'm not really knocking the system. It was just mine, my interest, you know, and uh,

Speaker 5:          00:14:06       I think it's almost impossible to find a style of teaching or a, a course of study that's going to be really interesting and fascinating to every kid. Right. It's the problem I think is shoving kids in classes and trying to educate them like they're a product like a factory, you know? I just don't think, I don't think the way we do it as the best way to do it. I don't have a better solution, so I have to shut the fuck up. Yeah. I don't either. Yeah. I don't either.

Speaker 2:          00:14:34       Um, yeah, we had to read that book. Brave new world kind of Ooh, trip me out. Yeah. Uh, I know if I'm ready for that, but yeah,

Speaker 5:          00:14:47       dude, you don't have a solution either of them. There's a cadillac that have in one of your videos.

Speaker 1:          00:14:52       Is that your car? I know God. No. See the hate when that shit happens. When those stylists, they hook you up with a car that I'm like, Damn, Gary Clark Jr drives a dope ass old cadillac. Nah, I drove a, I drive a 94 Cadillac that I think is pretty dope with the director of the video is like no, it's a piece of shit. He got this, you got this girl, um, uh, to bring her a ride. And um, what year was that one? I think it was like a 66. Who was so slick. It was like if Gary Clark Jr really drives that Cadillac. There it is. Look at that mother fucker. Yeah man. Dude, you look like you just stepped off the set of superfly. I know, I know. And you know, and then I got back to my house and then like got in my car to go to do whatever I had to do and I was like, man, this is not the same shit but fucking car is sick. Yeah, it was amazing. How did you get to drive it? I'm not like a hungry, no, no, no. I drove it up and down that street like I like seven times. It's so depressing what they do, man. They've, but they nailed it. They found the perfect car for your music. Yeah, I know. Like that's a soulful car. That car has soul to it. It's got like a, it's a piece of a history. It's a, it's a piece of art, you know? Yeah. Know you're making me feel really terrible.

Speaker 1:          00:16:28       But you're a success with musician, man. Everybody knows who you are. Go out and get it suite six to six. Yeah. Cause I don't drive that much anymore. I spend so much time on the road man. Right. So, you know, uh, someday I have a nice little collection someday, someday in the, in the mind you got, so you drive, you drive a cadillac though. Yeah. Escalate or something. No, no, no. I got one. Yeah, I got this, this 94 Cadillac Deville when I was 19 I still got it. Really? Yeah, man. Even cooler because that one's kind of a poser car and a lot of ways his car in the photo, like you know the beautiful 66 you can't really take that thing anywhere. Look at that. What are you gonna take it? You got to park it there. Some asshole with Volvo. Volvo's going to open up the car door on you, you know?

Speaker 1:          00:17:14       Yeah. I would struggle to parallel park. That thing you're going to get looks from those shitheads and Prius's the self righteous moral high ground people. They're going to look at you. Do you have any idea? Is it worth it? Is it really worth it? You're killing seals. He's going to look at your shitty. Yeah, so look at the fucking hubcaps or the rims on that. It must be in rhythm. So those aren't hubcaps that some aftermarket shit and those beautiful white wall tires. But a lot of ways like your car is actually cooler because your car is like a car that no one, no one gets. No one wants to try it. I they don't get it to try to like look cool. Like that car is such a, I'm getting it to look cool car that it's not even yours. And they used it for you in a music video to make you look bad ass. Right. Right. But your car is actually more badass because it's your first car from the time when you're 19 you still have it right and you drive it. But that's pretty cool though. Fuck yeah, that's cool. One day. Thanks for making me feel better though. Well, you're more, you're more authentic. See like if you were like going way out of your way to own that car, but it was breaking down all the time and it was fucking up and that will be kind of silly. That was your only car,

Speaker 2:          00:18:28       right? Yeah. Yeah. But I'm thinking about my car breaking down on

Speaker 1:          00:18:34       does. It does. Yeah, it did. Well, you got to get one of them new ones. Those new cadillacs at fucking space ships. I saw some new thing though. We're working on. Yeah, they have a bunch of new ones now. Cadillacs, got some incredible cars. Now they're finally, they like something happened in like the late nineties, early two thousands. They started turning around and now they have pretty amazing cars. Hello. Well, I know you need like a CTSV one. Those I've been in, I've been in a bubble and musical bubble in a musical bubble and then, uh, uh, baby bubble, double bubble. Yeah. So I'm two babies, like being, I'm getting out, I'm here. I am. So yeah, that's like a two baby bubble, right? Because music is kind of like you're giving birth to an album.

Speaker 2:          00:19:25       Does that make sense? Yeah, definitely. That's how I feel about it. Uh, yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:19:30       Do you knew one that you came out with in September? It sounds different than the other ones, but cool. But in they're like, it's almost like you were, you know, I'm like, you're taking different chances or you're, you're experimenting with like different sounds.

Speaker 2:          00:19:44       Hmm. Well, yeah, I was telling Jamie when I came in here and I was like, uh, before I recorded, uh, my first album on a major black and blue, I was living in Texas and I had a live room where I had drums, keys, bass rig, guitar, all set up. And then another room I had my turntables, drum machines, uh, keyboards all like put it like I'm going to this pro tools session. So I was just making demos and sampling records and just kind of doing whatever I wanted to, wanted to do. And, um, so for this, yeah, for this latest record, I just kind of wanting to get back into that space and experiment and vibe and challenge myself musically. You know, it's like just playing out on the road every, every night or whatever for a few years, kind of playing the same songs and, you know, trying to, uh, bring new life of those in a certain way was different than, um, I felt like I was kind of stagnant.

Speaker 2:          00:20:52       Like I wasn't playing drums like I was every day. I wasn't playing bass like I was. And I, you know, I want to be a musician, I want to be all around musician and push it to the limit. So for this latest record, I just was able to do that and spend a lot of time and uh, so yeah, it does sound different. It's all me playing, you know, most of the instruments as opposed to the last one was a band. Oh Wow. How many, how many different instruments you play? Um, I guess I wouldn't say I play them. I mess around and some of it works. But I played drums, I played bass keys. Um, harmonica, percussion. Yeah, just kind of the foundation.

Speaker 5:          00:21:38       And did you take lessons for any of these, but formal lessons? Like once you started rolling and you started becoming a musician?

Speaker 2:          00:21:45       No, no, no. I was, I was a choir boy in middle school. Well, yeah. Yeah, I got a hard time for the basketball team. Just man, they used to give me a hard time. So that was the formal training that I had. I learned, you know, scales and notes like that, but so you can read music, not really.

Speaker 5:          00:22:06       You put, you can put it, you can put a chart

Speaker 2:          00:22:08       in front of me and I'll, okay, no idea.

Speaker 5:          00:22:15       I have no idea. That's so crazy. Yeah. Musician, like you're, you're a real musician. You have like records you with a record label. I see your shit and I saw you shared at the airport once a music video that was playing on a television. They're like, you're a professional musician, but I don't read music. No, but it's like me being a comedian. That doesn't, right? No, it's worse. It's like me being an author who doesn't read

Speaker 2:          00:22:42       books, who can't read books. Does that make sense? No, no.

Speaker 5:          00:22:47       Jamie says no guy behind me. He didn't play with Hendrix. You Dj. I got to take that picture down and put a real one up. Unfortunately, that's not his real a mugshot photo. It's a real photo obviously, but that's not the actual four. They fucked me, man. I bought this shit. That's Rosa parks. Real mugshot photo though. The Elvis one is real, but it's not really a mugshot. It was when he went to visit Nixon in the White House or took a photo of him for goof. But that's just a classic picture of Hendrix. And then they put his actual mugshot photo, uh, underneath it. He's real photo was him with like shorter hair. It looked more like a classic Afro. That's like Jimi Hendrix experience when they had those white dudes behind him with the big Afros as well. Yeah. That's his real photo. Yes. See, you see the, um, the image is correct for the Mugshot, like for his name, but that's the wrong photo.

Speaker 2:          00:23:43       They fucked me.

Speaker 1:          00:23:45       Somebody had to tell me thank you ever told me some, some dude online. Let me know. Hey Dude, that ain't the real one. Fuck, fuck right assholes. They just got a good one. I mean, that looks like the perfect arrest photo of Jimmy Hendrix. And he also has this looking at his face. Like, I can't believe these motherfuckers who arrested me. Where's the other one? He, he's got the look like, Oh shit, I just got fucking arrested for heroin. That's a different look. You know, that's, that's the, ah, fuck. I can't let, God dammit I get tea. I take the picture man. Shit, Shit. I'm a obviously a huge Hendrix fan and I can't bring myself to read. He had a former bodyguard that wrote some book that claims that his ex manager had him killed. That Hendricks manager not only had him killed but even had him kidnapped at one point in time just so he could rescue him cause hendricks is going to leave his manager.

Speaker 1:          00:24:45       They also, this guy also alleges that hendricks manager killed hendricks girlfriend who was with him at the time that he died. Like she jumped off a building in Soho, I believe. Um, and they, they think that they threw her off that building because she knew that this guy had killed Hendrix. I Dunno. I Dunno. Either. You, so you did read the no, no, I can't bring myself to it. I can't either because I don't want to get down some rabbit hole that I can't prove. But this guy who was a, he was a musician himself, he was with the animals, I believe. You know, um, what was the one hit song they had? Um, I forget the song, but he was a, he was actually a musician himself and it didn't work out for him. And he started working as a bodyguard for, um, for Hendricks and working with this manager character who was apparently like universally known as like a really bad guy, like real shady. Like back in the day of music, you were dealing with a lot of mob characters, right? A lot of organized crime characters. A lot of creepy, like a lot of dangerous people like Phil Spector. That crazy. Fuck. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:25:59       Yep. I mean, it doesn't get any crazier than that guy. And if you don't know who Phil Spector is, you'll google him and you go, well, how come his hair looks like this in one picture? And it has hair. Like he wore a bunch of crazy wigs when he got arrested for shooting a woman in the mouth just a few years ago and a killer, he picked up some woman at a bar on sunset, took it back to his mansion and shot her in the mouth. Yeah, he was crazy. But that guy was famous for like putting guns in people's mouths. He was a famous for pulling guns on people and apparently it was just a big part of the music business back then. It was organized crime and just dangerous people with ties to organized crime. And this guy who managed Hendrix, Hendrix apparently wanted to leave him and as he was on his way

Speaker 5:          00:26:43       out, that's when this guy had the Hendrix kidnapped. This is what they are alleging in the book and I believe it's been confirmed that Hendricks was kidnapped and this guy did, um, get him rescued the idea. He had him kidnapped so he could rescue them. So He'd say, Look Dude, you need me. I just fucking saved your life.

Speaker 2:          00:27:04       That's crazy. Fucking up shit. Crazy fucked up shit. Yeah. I don't know if I could dig

Speaker 5:          00:27:12       deep and read. Yeah, exactly. They don't want to go. There I go. I would like to know the truth, but I don't, I almost don't want to go down the rabbit hole.

Speaker 2:          00:27:19       His name was Mike Jeffrey and apparently he was also a demolition expert and assassin for the British. Am I six before he was a manager. Whoa. Jesus. Yeah. Whoa.

Speaker 5:          00:27:35       Okay. I got it. It sounds fascinating now. I got some shit to read this weekend. Definitely. I don't know why I haven't come across anything like that. Music business you get kind of compared to him now in a lot of ways. Why is that? Is it just because you're a handsome young black man was very good at the guitar? I think it's cause I'm handsome. What is it? What are we, I think that's what it is, but that's what it is. But you do have like, um, like in num num is a perfect example of that. You have, that's a, it's an unusual sound. You know those guitar riffs that you have in that and it's uh, I can't like that. There's certain sounds so you go, oh, like that's a carry karch sound like that sounds like, like Hendrix, there was a bunch of Hendrix songs where you can hear like Voodoo child, a Nigga. Okay, well that's fucking Hendrix. You know, like people can, they can catch that sort of unique sound in a world of people riffing in a world of people making these amazing sounds with guitars. Occasionally someone can isolate like particular sounds like of course ac DC. Right, right, right. You know, you listen to ACDC, it's like almost immediately, you know, it's an ACDC song, but you've got your own thing going on.

Speaker 2:          00:28:56       Uh, yeah, I think so. Um, but I, I can understand that Hendrick's comparisons, I mean fuzzy guitars over heavy riffs, black guy doing it, you know, um, yeah, I get it. It used to bother me, but I'm not mad at it. I mean, it's like he's great. Yeah. I want to be great, you know? And if people have thrown your name and the same sentences greats in a positive way, I'll take it and just keep practicing.

Speaker 5:          00:29:29       Perfect attitude, man. You know what I mean? Yeah. That's perfect. Yeah. What kind of music are you into?

Speaker 2:          00:29:35       Um, what am I into? Uh, uh, at the, I'm into like, uh, s southern hip hop. Really? Yeah. Like, uh, speaking at cadillacs and stuff. I used to drive around and I don't know if y'all got like the chopped and screwed the stuff, but like I used to listen to Dj screw and, um, what's the chop to unscrewed stuff? What's your house? It's like, it's like, it's like the music. It's like, it's just slowed down and kind of, you know, like they'll take a lyric and like on a turntable and chop it up and like repeat something or whatever. And it's really kind of a headache, trippy stuff. So I used to, you know, I listened to that all the time and uh, so I just recently kind of got back into listening to, um, you know, things like that. Like I got Paul Walls record slim thug, loosen the big credit. Um, so just like Texas southern,

Speaker 1:          00:30:42       I don't know if it was me, what to do with braces, right? He's got a grill, the grill, sorry, I get confused.

Speaker 1:          00:30:52       Oh Shit. That's a little bit different. But yeah, so I've been, I've been listening, I don't know if it's like Texas always has braces, braces, and so what does it, how does he eat corn on the cob? That's my question. I don't know. I think those come out. I think you take him out. Yeah. Yeah. That's like some shitty wears like a dental dam or no, that's when you eat some dangerous, that's a dental dance floor, right? It's for eating dangerous pussy. That is a, which by the way, if you use that, kill yourself. If you're even thinking about going down on a girl and you have to throw a fucking tarp over at first, he really, you've made some terrible choices and you probably never going to recover this stop.

Speaker 3:          00:31:35       Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:31:37       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:31:41       Oh Man. All right. Come on. That's where it's at. Will you kiss her? But you won't eat her pussy. Stop. Yeah. He uses chaos. Gone too far. Did you live in your life completely wrong. You need an intervention, psychedelics or something? Psychedelics?

Speaker 2:          00:31:59       Um, yeah. It's been a long time for me on that. Oh, really? We can, we can help you. Jamie can, he knows people, right? No,

Speaker 1:          00:32:09       passing off on him. He kept to the case. The cops are listening. Listening. Yeah. Right. Well, it's getting closer and closer to being legal, man. I mean, they just, uh, they just released some new, uh, new financial stats on the amount of money that they're making off medical marijuana once, if they can, if they can really establish that this is like a nationwide way that people can make a ton of money off taxes and turn economies around it. They haven't Denver, I mean, they turn the economy in Denver around. Do you perform there a lot?

Speaker 2:          00:32:37       Um, I'm not a lot.

Speaker 5:          00:32:40       I'm trying to get there more. Yeah. But uh, yeah, it doesn't belly up a couple of times and done some, uh, did red rocks out there? Oh Man. Yeah, a couple of times. A lot of beautiful venue. That is, Huh? Yeah, it's great. But I mean, the vibe is killed. It's a great experience as far as every, all that, well, the Denver vibe is like, it's like some new American Amsterdam type shit or something. It's crazy. It's this amazing city now. I mean, it went from being this cowboy city that was filled with really cool people to somewhere, I think in the early two thousands, I don't remember what the year it was. They decriminalized marijuana in the city of Denver. They just went, fuck it. We're just not arresting anybody for it. It's a stupid, they like you. You could have all your state laws you can have on your national laws.

Speaker 5:          00:33:26       We're just not going to arrest people for it. Okay, we're done. And so they would tell us that when we're working. They're like, what? I'm like, yeah, they don't care. You could smoke pot. And I'm like, really? Like yeah, they won't arrest you. They publicly said they won't arrest you. So there was, that was the first stepping point. And then when it became legal and now they make more money from it than they do from alcohol, which is incredible. They make more money in tax because the taxes are very high. Like it's 39% taxes for recreational marijuana. But nobody gives a fuck because it's still way cheaper than alcohol. Like you could get $10 for the weed and be fucked up for the entire day. That's true. You know, I mean, you take one $5 pot candy, so what? It's 39% taxes. What does that, so that makes it, what, eight bucks?

Speaker 5:          00:34:13       So then you, then you take that one pot candy and your barbecued, right? That's one jamison. Yeah, exactly. It's one drink. It's like not even close. So like economically it's a great thing for the city. And once, once that sort of sets in that we've been lied to about that. And then all these new studies are coming out, um, about the, the benefits of a different psychedelics for ptsd. A John Hopkins did a longterm study on silicide been, they're doing new studies on psilocybin with people that are terminally ill and uh, people that are, uh, they're getting towards the end of life, you know, older folks and it's just a alleviated tension and worry and fear of death and in a beautiful way. And then they'll realize like, hey, you know, we can profit off this shit. Like this is, this is more money that can be generated to help the school systems, the fix the roads to hire new cops to, to change the way, you know, we, we, uh, address and interface with these things and stop, stop criminalizing them. Right. Yeah, I totally agree. I'm not as educated on all that as I would like to be, but I feel like, um, you know, once that door gets opened up, yeah, it'd be a lot more beneficial than it is. Uh, he said to be, you know, hurting. Yeah. Well, we're just stuck in the momentum of an ignorant past. It's what it is. You know what I'm saying? What, what kind of psychedelics have you experimented

Speaker 2:          00:35:38       with Gary Clark, Jr I spent,

Speaker 1:          00:35:42       are you looking at, I just started sweating. I looked at it. It could be a cop.

Speaker 2:          00:35:50       Yeah. I was like, oh man. I was like, man, when I walk into, hold on a minute. Yeah. I spend a little time, I love a psychedelic mushrooms. It's been a long time, but, um, I, I definitely have a experiment. I feel like I've gained some things from those experiences. Uh, that's about it does, that's a good one though. Mushrooms and weed. Yeah, both. Excellent combination. I love it. Well, keep, Texas is a great place for it too because Texas, there's a lot of mushrooms that grow wild out there. Yeah. W Yeah, we, um, we kind of have parties where we would run around and go pick them and yeah. Did you really? Yeah. It's kind of gross.

Speaker 1:          00:36:35       Pick them off couch. Yeah. It's disgusting. But how did you know they were the right ones?

Speaker 2:          00:36:39       Oh, uh, I is the group of people.

Speaker 1:          00:36:42       Well, I surrounding myself, ah, people that my mom said you should stay away from them. Those mycologists.

Speaker 2:          00:36:51       Yeah. Um, so it was just kinda like, uh, uh, I was hanging with the right crowd. Right crowd. The right crowd. Yeah. It definitely, it turns out to be the right crowd, right.

Speaker 1:          00:37:04       The right crowd. You know, the ones that your mom probably told you should hang out with, they're on fucking antidepressants right now. Freaking out, hitting Midlife, wondering what the fuck they're doing with themselves. Having children being, being trapped in some job where there, you know, most likely with the people that go the way that everybody wanted us to go. Like whether it's a lawyer or successful businessman, they're stressed the fuck out working long crazy hours.

Speaker 2:          00:37:28       Right? Yeah. Yeah. I totally agree. I mean, I feel like regardless of, or despite the, uh, the tension that I had, I mean, I grew up constantly very strict, very, um, you know, I was raised baptist, you know, very straight, very strict family, military. So any of that was completely taboo and I would, that would be my ass if they found out anything about it. But for some reason I felt like I wanted to break out and, and discover on my own, you know what I mean? And not kind of not be locked into what was just laid out for me, you know? Yeah. And, um, so yeah, you're right. It turned out being the right crowd,

Speaker 1:          00:38:16       not doing great. That's just seems to be a common theme. Suppression leads to, you know, trying to alleviate that suppression by this not listening well by you just going crazy by your exploring, taking chances. Oftentimes like the most strict upbringings, but deliver a child is like more prone to rebellion and I just, kids don't like to be told what the fuck to do. Yeah. Yeah. You're there. It's normal. Tell me what to do exactly what I'm zack opposite. Yeah. And I'm sure you're probably going to impart that into your own children too, because you kind of remember, I mean, I certainly do with my children. I remember being told what to do and just you strapped me fucking crazy. People don't like it. They, they, they, they don't mind rules. If the rules make sense. Like, Hey, don't stick a fork into electric socket cause he could fucking die.

Speaker 1:          00:39:12       Oh, okay. That's a big one at my house right now. How old your kid just turned one. Oh yeah. Figured out how to open the door and walk like it within two days. Boy. Girl, boy. Yeah, they're mobile man. It was like, yeah, Jesus. Yeah. He started checking pumps. They wake up, they don't say Shit and you might be sleeping and then like, let me just fucking check out what's going on in this house. What is that Chord puck stuck in the wall. Hmm. There's some holes in there, you know, some other shit would fit in there like coins and then they start sticking things in there. Blowing my mind right now anyway. Yeah, they're, they're uh, they're fascinating. They're little people.

Speaker 2:          00:39:49       You know, but yeah, I'm trying to, you know, definitely be conscious of, of, of that, you know, as, as he grows and, and, and uh, I wouldn't mind questioning why. Yeah. There's the whole, because, right. Because I said, Eh, yeah, yeah. I can't, can't do that. Yeah. I can't do that to this. It drives me fucking nuts.

Speaker 1:          00:40:17       Of course. Well, I have a theory on all that stuff. I think that every generation gathers up the information of how the previous generation fucked up. And as long as there's no cataclysmic disasters and we're not living in Mad Max Times where it's like desperado days and everyone's fending for themselves and it's just about survival, then things just keep getting better. Right. Well now you can pull out your mobile though,

Speaker 2:          00:40:43       vice and you know, figure out what's really happening, you know? Yeah. And, and uh, that's kind of a trip. Oh yeah. I mean, to kind of grow up in and just not really, no, not have access. Like we have access now. I mean, it still blows my mind like that. I forget sometimes that if I want to know something I can just google. Yeah, instant. I mean it's, it's amazing. Yeah. Yeah. So I saw something you were talking about these google glasses and like, you know, these whole being, these, I don't know what it is, it's a my buddy Chris was trying to tell me about it as well.

Speaker 1:          00:41:29       Well there's a bunch of different kinds. There's the regular google glasses, which a lot of people have, which is a very small

Speaker 5:          00:41:34       lens. It sits on like a mock frames. It looks like a glass frame without any glasses in it. And then there's one small window but that didn't really catch on. So what they're working on now is a contact lenses that do the same thing. And, but the Google, the glass thing, you had like a little swipe thing and you could like swipe left and right and move it around. Like so he could go, like I could say, I could Google Gary Clark images and I would see in that little tiny window images of you and I could just swipe through them. You could say navigate to the Hollywood bowl. And it would take, it would show you google maps, how to get to the Hollywood bowl and he would talk to you in your ear. But people didn't like it cause it looked goofy and, and when people were wearing them, other people got pissed off.

Speaker 5:          00:42:20       Like are you filming me? Like what are you doing? Cause you could fill them with them too. So now they're, they've moved to contact lenses, which they haven't really released yet but they're working on them. And then there's another one that's way crazier, which is like goggles and these are like ski goggles and when you put these motherfuckers on, you're going to be able to play video games in three d space. You're going to have like three dimensional holograms around you. That's the thing. That's the thing I was wondering about. So called magic leap or now magically visit one magic leap in the Hollow Lens by Microsoft. That's the one with the goggles, right? The Hollow Lens. But yeah. What are you thinking about that? It's crazy. This is just step one. I've actually been talking about this onstage recently because I'm actually kind of freaked out about it, that we're going to enter a world within the next hundred years where artificial reality is indistinguishable from regular reality.

Speaker 5:          00:43:11       It's the matrix. It's 100% going to happen if we don't blow ourselves up and we don't die from disease. If we don't get hit by an asteroid, we're going to be able to figure out a way to trick the mind into thinking. It's experiencing things that it's not experiencing. Whether how long it takes is just subjective, but whatever the amount of time it is in the history of the universe or the history of this planet, it's a blink and in one blank, you're not going to be able to tell where the reality is real or not. You're going to be able to plug into something and you're going to be able to have artificial experiences. So like we could do this like, hey, yeah, we might be doing it right now. That's what's fucked up about it. When, when scientists study artificial reality and they study what they call computer simulation theory, they're the real mind fuck is. It's hard to tell whether or not this is a simulation and that it's very likely that it could be that our entire universe could be some sort of a massive simulation that we're experiencing and might not even be like a computer simulation. It might be some sort of a simulation that's going on, like at a cellular level, like some sort of a mass hallucination.

Speaker 5:          00:44:25       Wow. Yeah. It's emily isn't enough. It was not my theories, but I think about that. These are not my ideas. Oh yeah. I don't even know what to say about that. Think about what you said right about Google Ryan, about being able to go to your phone and have it all the answers when you were a kid. That was magic. That was magic, right? The idea behind that was insane. Just 20 years ago, 1996 the idea of being able to do that was insane. Everybody be like, what in the fuck are you talking about? You're going to be to reach a new phone. You've gotta be able to touch a piece of glass. You can not, you didn't have to touch it. You press a button and you talk to it and it'll tell you anything you need to know. Like what? How the fuck is that possible? You're going to go watch videos on it. Shut the fuck up. You're going to watch movies on it. You're gonna be able to play hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of hours of music on it. It'll sound beautiful and it all be a thing that's so slim and sleek. It fits right in your pocket. Like we're already living in some crazy movie that they didn't even predict. And Star track a sidetrack. They had walkie talkies number.

Speaker 2:          00:45:32       That's crazy. It is crazy. I'm just getting old. What does this Jamie, Microsoft added a new update to what hollow lens is going to look like. This is what they think is watching. Sports will be like in the future kind of says like what? Watching football. A football game, right?

Speaker 1:          00:45:51       Oh you be able to watch it in front of you. All sorts of players. You can have players in stats pop up and you're like living room and get extra. It looks really, so everyone's just going to sit down and put these goggles on instead of having a television or with the television. So you'll have access to TV. Look at this. I could only imagine what like a UFC event watching that would be like, you know what I mean? To get extra stats on the players will be really cool. Also, probably we'll put a big camera on the referee so you'd be inside of it are watching me watching from their view, you know what I mean? Watching from any players view if you choose to, if they can pull that off with, well they probably could do that with players. It wouldn't be able to do it with fighters. But with the pride, they used to have a camera, but they would put on the referees. It was this crazy dorky thing.

Speaker 5:          00:46:41       It was like real big and clunky. It was like a camera that's sat next to their head and they would, uh, they would wear that thing and it was kind of cool to see it from their perspective, but that was fairly rudimentary considering it was like early two thousands, like what this is going to be is going to be bananas, but then you got to hang out with goggles on,

Speaker 2:          00:47:01       you know, friends have to have goggles. Oh Man. Yeah, I dunno. I guess it's, it's kind of like the silent disco thing. What's the silent disco thing? A silent disco is like where people, like a whole bunch of people hang out in a room or a club and they have headphones on and there's like, there's Djs and you can decide if you want to go with Dj, a Dj be. And so it was a bunch of people like dancing in a silent room with headphones on. Really like having a great time. And then it's like, do you want to drink? What?

Speaker 1:          00:47:41       Oh, is this it right here? You show me this Jamie. So this is people the dancing around and they just have different wireless headsets on. Yeah. Oh, okay. Oh this is crazy.

Speaker 6:          00:47:58       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:47:59       Everyone's just listening to the same thing. There's just no out like no one outside can hear you. Well that's good to your neighbors. That's awesome. In that way it's great for your neighbors. Yeah. You don't have to be rude because it's like that one asshole on your block who has a party but his music tastes sox. There was this part of that they had near my neighborhood about 10 years ago and it was the most fucking depressing, like trapped in the, it was like, Oh let me try to remember what kind of music there. But it was like the captain and to kneel or some shit. It was so bad. It was just like, like how would they cranking this? Like what the fuck are they doing? You want to show up at their house with like some wine? That's a bad example. I can't remember what it was cause I blocked it out.

Speaker 1:          00:48:42       Like childhood molestation. It was so bad. They were, they were playing this fucking terrible, but it was like this asshole was playing it loud like he, it wasn't, you couldn't even enjoy, it was so loud. There's no way he was enjoying it. He was enjoying showing off that he was having a party with this shitty music that him and his dying friends were playing. What do you listen to? I listened to a lot of classic rock a lot. Like as I get older it just seems like I'm becoming that old dude that listens to classic rock. Like I listen to a lot of Leonard Skinner, a lot of Hendrix. I've been listening to a lot of, um, boy, just almost anything from the 60s and the early seventies is what a lot of, a lot of what I listened to. Listen, a lot of credence lately. Craziness. Yeah,

Speaker 2:          00:49:30       that's good. I uh, fuck with his voice used to kind of mess me up, but I've come to like, except appreciate the tone and like the, you know, comes from a heartfelt place. When I was younger I couldn't, what's he saying? Yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:49:47       you got to, there's certain music that you got to revisit as you hit different stages in life. I think there's certain music that I wasn't into and then I'll go back now and now I can get into it. Credence is one of those. Yeah. Like my friends in high school or in the credence and no one was

Speaker 2:          00:50:03       yeah. In high school people were listening to.

Speaker 6:          00:50:09       Hm.

Speaker 2:          00:50:09       Uh, the Houston like Swisher House, Paul Wall. Um,

Speaker 1:          00:50:14       that's all it. Cough Syrup. Music, right? Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:50:19       It's like, so it was a dat ugk outcast lot of Dave Matthews.

Speaker 4:          00:50:29       Okay.

Speaker 3:          00:50:29       A lot. Dave Matthews I went to, I went to like this, I went to the school board. Dangerous shut this podcast off. Right. That's it. That's done there. But it was different. Cory, moral Robert or

Speaker 2:          00:50:42       gain like a lot of it was different. Like, um, and some of it I've come to appreciate and some of it I've just kinda left behind. I like outcast, outcast. They do a lot of experimental shit. Yeah, they're great. They do a lot of interest. It didn't, didn't want to do from outkast. Was any supposed to play Jimmy Hendrix? He did. Yeah, he did that movie. I never heard of it. No, never, never heard a thing about it. They just came and went. Did you see it? Yeah, I saw it out here. How was it? Uh, it was good as far as the story. I mean it was, I felt like I, uh, Andre Played Hendrix. Great.

Speaker 4:          00:51:25       Uh,

Speaker 2:          00:51:27       there was a lot of the stuff that I didn't know that where they had to do different music cause they couldn't use the Hendrix music. So that, that for me was kind of fucked me up a little bit, a little bit because it was, it was recreated and then being a guitar player

Speaker 3:          00:51:47       was it quiet? Like it really Kinda mess me up. But I mean the story was,

Speaker 2:          00:51:54       was great and I think Andre did a great job in the casita great job considering what they, you know, we're working with, but there was no Hendrickson music. How could they should scrap the project or paid up, paid the family. You got to pay the family if you want to make a fucking documentary or a bio pic. About arguably the greatest guitarist that's ever lived. You gotta use this fucking music and got to give his parents the money or whoever, whoever's alive, give him the money and if you gotta pay him, that's the only way you're going to do it. Right. Otherwise you're going to get a movie like that where we don't talk about it just goes in and out. Yeah. The guitar thing must drive you crazy though when you know he's not really playing that I couldn't handle it

Speaker 5:          00:52:35       cause me on a much lesser scale. I'm not a professional pool player, but when I watched someone in a movie and I know they can't really play pool, it's very obvious. You see the way a guy's holding a stick, the way the stick moves in their arm. It's like, have you ever seen someone hold a cigarette that doesn't really smoke and you could tell like a smoker can tell like almost immediately when someone doesn't actually smoke or at least someone who is not aware of how people smoke smoke. I'm sure an actor can figure out how to smoke like a smoker, a lot easier than someone could figure out how to play guitar and Mimic it. Right. Because when I see someone who can't play pool and a movie and you're like, you know, pool hall junkies or something like that, my shit get that fucking thing off to tell. It just drives me crazy. I that guy can't play, he can't play. There's no, he's doing it all wrong. I know. He's really good. His bridge, look at the way he's holding it. This is bullshit. And that's something real similar. I mean he real simple

Speaker 1:          00:53:26       rather, it's just uh, the movement of an arm. And I could tell, but for fingers and keys and the way a guy's sounding, I mean, they must be bananas to you. Yeah, I uh, yeah, it drove me nuts. I mean, I don't know what to say. I was like, fuck, somebody picks it. But yeah. What the fuck man? How do they not have like a coordinator? I Dunno. I Dunno. I Dunno. But you know, unless your bullshit and unless it's like a crazy Kung fu movie, like obviously I have a connection to martial arts where if I know someone's doing something that's not really gonna work, it'll drive me crazy. But if he's like, wow, like fucking pulling people's hearts out and flying through the air and throwing side kicks through buildings, I'm willing to suspend disbelief, you know? But you can't do that for Jimi Hendrix in a fucking biopic.

Speaker 1:          00:54:16       Yeah, that's true. I've got a question for you. One of my favorite shows growing up was Kung Fu with David carradine. Yeah. How did you feel about it? Oh, bullshit. Yeah. Yeah. I loved it. It when I was a kid though. Right. But you watch it now and you're like, what? But it was basically fighting. People didn't know how to fight. Think there was no one he fought. Like some dude came out and was a legit, and Moy Thai fighters started kicking his legs. Right. The carotene wrote out and killed him. It was awesome. Drunk guy with the beer mug. Yeah, exactly. I don't think he really learned Kung Fu for that show. I don't know, but it didn't seem like he did. It seemed like he had very little, that seemed like a real martial arts move. Yeah. I don't, I, I recently went back a couple of years ago, bought the series and watched the whole thing cause as a kid I loved it. It was, yeah, my dad, we'll put it on here you go son, learn something, you know, lessons about how not to be an asshole. Yeah. And uh, so yeah, but I watched it recently and I was wearing, I was like, what are these guys? So, you know, cause he was like, really know what's up. How do you feel about this? Because I don't know. You know what I mean? Right. So yeah, no one respects it. Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:55:36       But it was a good show in terms of interesting, like if you take out the martial arts element of it, it's an interesting show. You got this guy who was raised in a, like a monastery and then he's wandering to the old west. It's kind of a cool premise. The premise behind it is really interesting, you know? And he was like this real calm, peaceful guy who wasn't an asshole at all. I could not have been nicer. And that was a unique character because there's really never been anybody on television. It was like that. Just like there's an enlightened, peaceful guy, you know, he had long hair and shit. He's just kind of a hippie and it's wandering through life and people keep fucking with them. Keep fucking with them. All right. You know, it was interesting in that way. Like it made a lot of people want to pretend they're that guy. I'm sure.

Speaker 3:          00:56:25       Definitely. Yeah. Like house out. How so? Yeah. How are you one of them?

Speaker 2:          00:56:32       I mean, uh, just, just the attitude, just the, you know, uh, I would, I was waiting for a moment, you know, I wish somebody would so I could quite Chang Caine.

Speaker 3:          00:56:46       That's the opposite though. He wished somebody would be peaceful. I mean, I was a kid so I can all right. You know,

Speaker 2:          00:56:54       of course. I love that. Speaking of being an inspired man, you know, one of my favorite things that I love to do, which I haven't done in awhile. It was, it was um, you know, catch up and watch the UFC, you know, and get into that. And um, I was sitting around and starting to kind of feel like a piece of shit, drinking too much and whatever. And so it was, you know, looking at these guys, you know, training and doing what they do. So I kinda inspired me to get on my bike and he'd get the heavy bag and get on the weights and do my thing. And uh, it was really into it. I haven't been been keeping up for awhile and kind of got the guts to show it and I'm working on them. I need to get back on my game is what I'm saying.

Speaker 1:          00:57:38       Do you want to train while you were in la? Is that what you're saying? I would love to find you need to, I need to do. So we'll talk off the air and uh, I'll, I'll get you to know like are you interested in taking Jujitsu or what are you interested in doing?

Speaker 2:          00:57:49       Well, whatever it was was kind of right for, for me and my build and, well I don't have a whole lot of time but I'm definitely interested in and getting back into it and get my mind focused.

Speaker 1:          00:58:00       The real reality is there's different styles of Jujitsu that are great for every build. And when I say different styles, I mean different approaches to Jujitsu is so broad. There's so many different techniques and there's so many different strategies and so many different moves and countermoves that your build is perfect for Jujitsu. You along and tall, you have long arms and long legs and you can catch people in chokes that a stubby little dude like me can't cause I have short arms, short legs, you know, it's different, but different builds like mine are better for certain positions like this, this guy who some are Paul Harris who's, he's like me but more exaggerated. He's way thicker and more muscular and he just tears people's legs apart. He's a leg lock specialist and there's a lot of other guys that are smaller that is like really fast and they're good at taking people's backs like Marcella Garcia.

Speaker 1:          00:58:47       But um, there's a lot of tall guys and Jujitsu. It's, there's definitely an advantage. It's an advantage of leverage. I'm like just mechanical leverage from having long limbs. It's good for striking to them, man. It's good for learning, not striking arts. Like if I, if I had to say like, if there's one bill that has like the most definitive advantages, I would say tall and long because it's harder to hit you because you're further away from me. Uh, you get hit me in a place where I can hit you. Like how tall are you? Six, four, six, four. I'm five. Eight. So you're dealing with all that. You're dealing with eight extra inches. So eight extra inches between, uh, your head in my head, which may or may not translate as far as like, uh, how long your arms are, how long your legs are.

Speaker 1:          00:59:31       But definitely there's a at least a few inches of advantage, which means like if we're both throwing punches at the same time, you had hit me before I would hit you and I probably would never hit you because of that because he would hit me like as I was throwing up punch and I'd get fucked up like that. That's a big advantage. Like John Jones, the UFC, a former light heavyweight champion. He's like the best at you cause he's a big tall dude and he's the best at like using that advantage. It's one of the best advantages of being long and tall. Right? Yeah. I'm ready. You Ready? I need to do checking, moving your jacket. I was like balling up my fists way. You're talking to like, yes, do this. Well that's a great way to blow off energy and stress. I need that as well. Definitely people get addicted to it.

Speaker 1:          01:00:12       Like we was talking about bordain um, he didn't even start doing it until he was 58 and 57 58 and now he does it every day. He does Jiu Jitsu every day. He loves it. He's obsessed with it. Yeah. A lot of musicians get into it. Um, I know a lot of musicians that are in a Jiu Jitsu, they, because it becomes like a martial arts really are an art form. It doesn't seem an art form to the outsider because people, they say, oh, it's just fighting. It's just brutality. But the reality is there's way, way, way more people who are into martial arts who never get into a fight ever then, then people who use it either in competition or use it for self defense. It's uh, it's, it's a form of art. It's an expression. And you, when you watch someone pull off a move, it's beautiful.

Speaker 1:          01:00:56       It's just, it's one of those things that seems to be only beautiful for people who understand it, but for people to understand that it's amazing. Yeah. No, I mean, I can respect it. I, I kind of understand what's going on. I can appreciate it. Like, you know, someone playing a nice solo or something and executing it well yeah, I can kind of get that, you know, the, the art, the what it takes to pay attention to and be in that moment and, and you know, uh, execute. It's a bunch. It's that, it's a bunch of other factors too. It's setting up an attack that either the person couldn't anticipate or couldn't figure out what to do in time and then it locks in and then once it locks in and be like, Oh shit, it's beautiful. It's like, it's like a painting or a work of art or masterful guitar solo or any of those things.

Speaker 1:          01:01:47       Art Is your, your dedication and your focus and then the expression and the results of that dedication and focus in a way where like if I'll watch someone pull off a move that I don't know how to do, it's particularly beautiful to me because I'm like, Oh shit, look what he did that like there's certain moves that I'll have to replay like over and over and over again. Like, I'll watch certain setups like over and over and over again until I get it into my head and, and I didn't this so many different ways to move the body that there's a lot of like I've been doing Jujitsu since 1996

Speaker 5:          01:02:20       and there's still a bunch of moves that I don't know, I don't understand and I have to go, oh, how did he do that? How did he do that? But today, like we're talking about like with Google, we're so lucky that we could just go to youtube videos. And one of the beautiful things about Jujitsu is it used to be that martial arts where like a secret, this is the secret death touch. And nobody would tell you that secret death touch, right? It didn't exist. It was bullshit. The reality of Jujitsu is almost every move people are dying to explain to people because people love learning new shit. People that are Jujitsu artists love learning new stuff. So people that are Jujutsu artists that have a new move, love to put that move online. It's a big part of the community. A huge part of the community is sharing and openness.

Speaker 5:          01:03:05       So like everybody does seminars and everybody teaches everybody everything. But in the early days it wasn't like that. Even the early days of Jujitsu when what happened was in 1993 when the UFC was created, people first started to see Jujitsu and they were like, what the fuck? But there was a lot of moves like triangles or things like along those lines where I had friends that would take classes at certain schools and they would say, hey, you know, hoists gracie tapped out Dan Saffron with a triangle, how do I do that? And the teacher like, you're not ready for that yet. Like I can't teach you that yet, but that's, that's a black belt technique or that's a purple belt technique or whatever. And they just, and people are turned off to it. And then they found other more unconventional openminded schools that immediately taught everybody everything. And those are the schools that became prosperous.

Speaker 5:          01:03:50       Those schools were really successful. And the schools that held people back, they never produce champions, they never produced any like real notable Jujitsu players. And the open minded like experimental schools, those are the ones that blew up. It's really interesting in that way, like the free exchange of information overwhelmingly won out in the world of Jujitsu. That makes sense to me. It does, right? Yeah. So how does it like, um, like I, I have a same kind of appreciation for like, like the art, martial arts, comedy, music, um, you know, anything like that. Like, I can appreciate the hard work and everything that goes back into, so you feel the same way about martial arts is like comedy or do you approach it the same way or? Well, um, in some ways, yeah, in some ways it's, it's about practice, dedication, application and reality. Like if something's not funny, it's just not funny.

Speaker 5:          01:04:50       If people don't laugh, they just don't laugh. And if a technique doesn't work, it just doesn't work. You know, if you can't pull it off, if somebody chokes you, they just choked you. You know, you could be a 20 year black belt, right. And some dude catches you in a guillotine. He's only been doing Jujitsu for six months, but someone teaches him how to do this. Grab your arm like that. Polar, any someone's neck, wrap your legs around him at squeeze and you can't get out. Well, he tapped you. Even if he's only been doing Jujitsu for six months and you've been doing Jujitsu for 30 years, it's stays. It's still real for guy taps you, they tap you just, there's no, if it's like, it's one of the things I love about pool. The ball either goes in the hole or it doesn't go in the hole.

Speaker 5:          01:05:29       It doesn't matter if either knock it in the hole or you don't. There's no almost made that shot. That doesn't mean Jack Shit, you know, it doesn't mean anything. I'm that asshole who says that. Well, we all say it, but you know the reality of the actual winning of the game, right? It's a personality thing. Like, sometimes people can get really far on a bullshit personality and a lot of bravado and a lot of bragging and a lot of false stories and, and, and then the actual application life is, they've sort of skirted through with all the dance moves and all the personality, but they don't have any real substance to it. That doesn't work in Jujitsu. Just like, it doesn't really work in comedy, comedy, like personality accounts for certain amount of the audience accepting you. But ultimately if the concepts aren't there and if you don't have like a good setup, if you don't know how to deliver it in a way that people are gonna, like it's going to easily enter into their mind and they're going to like carry along, then it either works or it doesn't. And there's, there's, there's some parallel truths in that in martial arts and in comedy in that way.

Speaker 5:          01:06:36       Yeah. Um, yeah, I'm, I'm, I'm very intrigued by all of it, so that's why I'm asking some very curious. I want to get in there. Well, all complex systems, whether it's music or writing, I'm creating a movie. Anything complex things are fascinating to me too cause I just like, I've never made a movie, but I want to see like CGI animators. I go watch this. Uh, this um, documentary on a guy's making a animated scenes for films like special effects scenes. And I think to myself, wow, that is fascinating that they're creating an artificial world and inside that artificial world, they have these creatures moving and they have these people they'd have to put on these motion capture suits and go through the motions, pretending they're interacting with these things that aren't even there. And then someone has to peace. It's amazing to me. It's amazing to me, but I'm not going to do it. I don't have any time.

Speaker 5:          01:07:34       But I look at that the same way I kind of look at music or the same way I look at writing or comedy or anything. So it's fascinating to me watching someone go after something and put it together and make something that is almost unfathomable take place. Whether it's a creation of an album, whether it's a, you know, a comedy special, whether it's someone writes an amazing book. I love when people get shit done. Yeah, I do too. It's a beautiful thing. Yeah. Right. Yeah. Well as artists, right? Like, does that, like, as as an artist, does that inspire you when you see, like if you go to see a great movie or read a great book or something like that, does that inspire you to want to

Speaker 1:          01:08:15       create?

Speaker 2:          01:08:18       Yeah. It doesn't inspire me to create a write a book. Right, right, right. But, um, I think I kind of know what my lane is right.

Speaker 1:          01:08:26       This point. Yeah. I try and stay in it. Yeah. Um, but yeah, I mean, I definitely go see you,

Speaker 2:          01:08:32       uh, uh, a movie or, or, or read, uh, you know, and, and it, it'll get my creative juices flowing and, you know, inspired me to be just be better and try and contribute, you know what I mean? Contributes something good or be positive and make, make myself feel something to make somebody else feel something. I Dunno. It, it does something to me. Definitely. It's hard to describe. I was still can't describe what it is that makes this creative thing, um, click or explain how I do what I do. But you definitely see in movies or hearing, you know, here and um, you know, like great musicians, great guitar players, you know, the freak me out. Oh Shit,

Speaker 1:          01:09:27       don't get too involved a little bit, you know what I mean? And I'm like, just hold the hunger, but yeah, no, it's like,

Speaker 2:          01:09:33       okay, I respect that. Let me go get on my game and do my thing. There was this, uh, ah, man, there was this a guitar player, um, down in Austin, Texas who I haven't seen in awhile. And uh, his name is Derek O'brian is one of the greatest blues guitar players in the world. Played backed up muddy waters. Um, Albert Collins, Albert can't, everybody's like in the house band at Anton says this club. Um, I hadn't seen him in awhile. And so I go back home and I got my little reputation and you know, people are like, ah, you know this by that, that, you know, I'm like, all right, I know my strengths and weaknesses, but I was feeling good about myself and then I got up on stage and let this, you know, this guy was just ripping it and I just, in that moment I was like,

Speaker 1:          01:10:33       I ain't got shit on this guy. You know what that's like. It was, it was a nice reality check. So I immediately went back and started shedding and I've been kind of doing it since. Yeah, that's a beautiful thing about being around inspiring artists. It's one of the cool things about being in a place like an la or Nashville or if you're a musician, if that's your style, I'm music or Austin or anywhere where there's a good group of people that are also doing the same thing. So you use those people and they use you and everybody's like fuel for each other. Yeah,

Speaker 2:          01:11:05       yeah, definitely. That's, um, I'm starting to kind of figure out the scenes here and in La a little bit more as well. You know, I went out the other night and had like this sitting in a jazz musicians and you know, really like the best of the best people are on top of their game. Folks who can read charts.

Speaker 5:          01:11:26       Yeah. When you do you practice, like do you go to like are there certain clubs that I'm a musician, like you can go and just fuck around with new stuff. Like for standups, we'll go to the comedy store and we'll practice or we'll go to the Improv and we'll practice. Like if I have some new bits and I'm working on right, I will go there and I'll air them out.

Speaker 2:          01:11:50       Right. Um, yeah. In, in Austin, well, from, there's this spa, every Sunday I'll have a blues jam, you know? And uh, so yeah. Yeah. You would either go sit in with people that you don't know I haven't played with before or whatever and, you know, try out some new chords. Maybe you learned something fancy that could, you know, transition chord, you know, to go from the one to five on a turnaround in this little blue is whatever, and the key to see whatever, you know. So you'd go work that out and um, or you bring your squad. I mean, me and my buddies, a potter when he plays in my band, we would go up sometimes and no, a drummer that kind of knew how we floated and the Bass player who could pick up on something like, and we got this new track, we're about to fuck people up.

Speaker 5:          01:12:44       This either would work or it wasn't. But yeah,

Speaker 2:          01:12:47       those places. And um, yeah, that's the kind of the fuel, you know, to be in those spots and be around other players and get up and do that thing. Um, yeah, that's, it was nothing like that. Yeah.

Speaker 5:          01:13:02       So for you, when you create music, is it, um, like do you just get an idea, like how did, what does the creation process from, is it, does it vary or is there a specific creation process from the moment you get an idea to putting it to paper or to remembering it and making a song and putting the beat to it and pin it, putting the sounds to it?

Speaker 2:          01:13:24       Um, it's kind of an unorganized mess. I said I haven't figured out a process and um, I don't think it's a mess. I think it just comes naturally. Like I'll have a guitar and I might, you know, have a chord progression and it'll just kind of stick and then I'll put a melody over it. I'll be singing something around the house and grabbed the guitar and put that together. Or um, you know, technology. I love being able to travel and you know, I travel a lot, so on airplane or on the bus I'll pull out the NPC or something and kind of put in drum tracks and build from there, whatever. So it all just kind of depends on where I am. And what I have access to and um,

Speaker 4:          01:14:12       uh,

Speaker 2:          01:14:13       but now having a little one being at home, I was like, gotta like take advantage of my time. It's like all you have an hour here, go try and make something happen. Right. So it's ever, ever changing it, but it just, whatever feels right. You know, I don't think if, if it becomes too much of a formula, then I think it will lose its,

Speaker 4:          01:14:34       uh, it's

Speaker 2:          01:14:37       raw, organic

Speaker 4:          01:14:40       kind of

Speaker 2:          01:14:42       what I got into it for, which is kind of not knowing and not not having any rules. Uh, you know, so yeah, it, it just

Speaker 5:          01:14:52       pins. That's a real common thing that you said that a lot of people say that once they had a kid, they realized that their free time is actually precious. So because kids demands so much time, babies demands so much time and you just really don't have much to, you start going, okay, the kid's asleep. Let's get to work, you know, and you actually get more done because you have children than you did when you were free.

Speaker 2:          01:15:16       Oh Man. I would sit around and eat us single living by myself, be working on the software, eight hours, I'd have it loop playing, you know, and just, uh, let me go get some food. I'll come back to that and maybe some awesome. Maybe I'll get like the genius idea or whatever. And um, yeah, I spent two months working on one song and you know, I don't, you don't have that much time anymore, so it's blessing, you know, kind of like get your shit together, you're going to do it or you're not. Yeah.

Speaker 5:          01:15:50       Louis C ck was the first person to tell me that and it didn't, it was so counter intuitive. I was like, really? He's like, yeah, I actually, I get a lot more done now that I have children than I did when I was free to do whatever I wanted. He was like, now I'm just under the gun all the time. So that's how I get things done.

Speaker 2:          01:16:05       Yeah. Well creatively, I guess for me, I mean we spend so much time out on the road, like we're gone a lot, so it's a kind of need, my quiet time. And there's not really a lot of quiet time with a bunch of dudes hanging around, smelled like ass. Yeah. Um, yeah. It's just, it's, it's a lot and I can't really function that way, so I kind of have to be home in order to be creative and do that.

Speaker 5:          01:16:39       When you go on the road, do you do like long stretches like you on the road for like two months at a time and have a bunch of dates laid out for you?

Speaker 2:          01:16:45       Yeah, we, I mean, we take off here next week and we're pretty much gone, um, until

Speaker 2:          01:16:57       maybe August or something. Whoa. I mean, we will have a few days here and there. I'll come back home and uh, you know, we'll be in when you bring your family. Yeah. Yeah. They'll come with me sometimes and um, yeah, like we just, they just came with us. We were in Australia and you know, just did the whole trip, you know, on the planes, everything. Woo. That flight. Yeah. That fight racks you, it's not my favorite. It's not my favorite either. I kind of hate it. Yeah. Somebody just offered me a trip to New Zealand, a vacation trip to New Zealand. I was like, bitch, that's not a vacation work. 16 hours of the fucking plane or whatever the hell it is. Like, come on. It doesn't, there's nothing vacation. He about that, Eh, I, it's beautiful over there, you know? But by the time he can get over that you're tired, you just want to go back home.

Speaker 2:          01:17:49       I would think that it would be a vacation for someone who didn't travel all the time. But for someone like you or someone like me who's always traveling, it's like, what? Yeah. Yeah. I kinda like to be at home. Yeah. Kind of boring that way. It's like I could be at my house for like three days straight. Yeah. But that's also because you travel so much. It's in direct contrast to that. So it's a welcome change. Right. But I got guys on my crew who get right off tour and just go hit it. Yeah. Yeah. Single guys though. No. Really? Yeah. Like, get off the plane, uh, you know, from the tour. And then just like boss up, my boy went to Cuba. Well, like going on tour for, for it seemed like what forever. And then he's like chilling and Cuba, but like why? And that seems exhausting.

Speaker 2:          01:18:38       But Cuba is one of those places though. I think I need to go to, I think I need to go do it before it changes. It's, yeah. So soon. Yeah. Cause right now there's no internet. They don't have any internet. Right. You can't keep track your emails. There's like a couple spots we need to get like three g my boy Chris Christian and found them. Yeah. How he found them. He found them. He was like, I love it. What's up Chris? He goes, he goes, I'm going down to queue. I'm not going to be able to, I'm not going to be able to uh, get in touch with you. Um, and I was like, all right man, you know, I get it. Cool, have fun. And then I get this call from this weird number. He's like, Yo, he fell in the one spot and I was like, man, why don't you just enjoy, you know, chill out.

Speaker 2:          01:19:21       Just be off the for a minute. Yeah. Sorry. It's one of the things I like most about a hunting trips. Like a lot of them, you're in places where you don't have a choice. You're in the middle of a mountain. Nothing up here, dude. Nothing. You might be able to get to the top of a mountain, send someone a text message. They might not be able to reply and they might not even get it. I might just get lost in the air somewhere. That's kind of where I need to go to the go. I'm write my songs, get out. So hunting trips, dude, I saw this thing. You, it's like this big ass all. Is it like a moose? Oh, Moose leg. Yeah. It's like walking through that airport, walking through somewhere and I was like, what the fuck? I felt

Speaker 5:          01:20:08       like this small of a, like a man. I was like, dude, this guy is beast mode. Right? Well, um, that was, uh, intentionally they wanted to make something that was like as in your face about the realities of meat as possible. Right. You know, I got into it with some people on twitter the other day cause I like, I like to troll vegans occasionally. I see you cause someone was making, there were some making some stupid shit saying that saturated fats are terrible for you. Like they're the another not, they're not there. Scientific studies that show saturated fats are actually healthy for you and important for you. But people think that if you hunt or if you're involved somehow in animals that year sometime sometimes eating animals that you're a cruel person, that you, you want to hurt animals. You want to cause pain and suffering.

Speaker 5:          01:20:55       The, no, I don't, I don't want to have anything to do with factory farming because I don't want to be involved in that. But the animals that I'm out hunting, like if I don't get them a wolf's get them or a coyote getting him or her mountain lions getting, I'm like, they're not living forever. They have a very short window of time. Whether they're alive, they're, if they're, if they make it, if a deere makes it a six years old that is a really old deer and most of them they die. Long before that when I'm doing is I'm stumped dipping my feet into that wild world and I'm pulling something out of it and that's where I get all my protein from or all my animal protein. I don't, I love animals. I think they're amazing. I have cats at home. I have dogs.

Speaker 5:          01:21:36       It's not a cruelty to animals thing and this is something that I used to think of when I thought of hunters. Like I saw some telephone shores. Hunter had a dog and he's petting his dog. I was like, how's this motherfucker differentiate between this dog and some deer? He's gonna like, shoot, it's the lungs out. Like how that's Kinda fucked up. It's kind of weird. But then I got it. Like the dog is a killer too, man. Everything life eats life and it's not a matter of being cruel. It's a matter of sustainability and being alive. Then there's the reality of hunting. Then not everybody can hunt. Not Everybody has the time. Not everybody wants to, especially in the world that we're, we've grown up in with the cities and it's something that took me several years to sort of get into it and really understand what it's all about and educate myself.

Speaker 5:          01:22:25       And then once I did educate myself, one of the most compelling things was how ignorant most people are about the facts of hunting, about the facts of wildlife, about wildlife management, and about just where their food comes from. And even about how many animals die making grain. How many of my people say, you know, I only eat, I only keen and fucking Alfalfa and guess what? That shit's getting chopped up in a combine. And it's chewing up bunnies and fawns and rats and mice and sparrows and ground nesting birds and, and you're removing the habitat when you growing food like that for a lot of different wildlife, wildlife gets displaced and the displaced wildlife wind getting preyed on this. It's like there's a lot of factors involved in gathering food and when we're living in cities, we're living in this bizarre natural environment. And when I say cities are a natural environment, they are a natural environment because they're there.

Speaker 5:          01:23:20       They're everywhere. They're a natural environment for people. Like anybody says the cities aren't natural man. Well, how come there's so many of them? Like what is nature? What does a beehive, is it a beehive nature? A beehive is nature, right? Well, that's a fucking be city. Okay? They've created a city. They know how to do it. They do it everywhere. That's the same goddamn thing people do. We create these super complicated beehives are call them cities and we create them all over the world, right? It's not like this one city. And we're like, what the fuck is that? The cities are everywhere. They are people. And when people figure shit out and they have electricity and they have agriculture, then they have surplus and then they, they put up fucking walls and make buildings and then boom, we got a city and they're everywhere. You look, I think, I think there's, there's just some strange detachment from where our food comes from when it's shipped in and trucks all the time.

Speaker 5:          01:24:09       So my, uh, education into the world of hunting, a big part of it was like to try to figure out, like, I try to figure out bizarre things, like things that don't make sense to me. I try to figure out, I tried to figure out, uh, all sorts of weird misconceptions and misunderstandings. I this what fascinates me about people that are involved in cults. So it fascinates me, but people that have bad conceptions or bad thoughts about psychedelics that are untrue, like people would think that, you know, certain things or make it to make you go crazy and lose your mind. What, well, why is that? What makes people, oh, well there's propaganda films for the 1930s. Well, what started that while it was a guy named William Randolph hearst, I'll actually profited from marijuana being illegal. Like, oh, okay. And he get, I'm fascinated by shit like that.

Speaker 5:          01:24:55       So the food thing was always fascinating to me. Like how was actually just go to a store and you get a piece of meat and we have no idea where the fuck this meat came from. We'd literally just, we don't even care. We throw it in the supermarket, you know, throw it in the cart, go through supermarket, give that guy a piece of plastic. He runs it through the machine and you're out the door. It's strange. It's very odd when that's a piece of life. Yeah, I think about that too, but I don't hunt, but do you eat me? I do, but it's not guilty. It's normal. Deep meet everybody like 90% this is the fact of the world eats meat. He right 90 95 depending on who you ask, but it's at least 90 of the world eats meat. Even Vegetarians, most vegetarian, some asshole said to me the other day, hilarious. He goes, I'm 90% vegetarian and I think, oh, shut the fuck up. Does you can't say that? How do you do that with how? That's not 90% vegetarian. That's not real. There's no such thing as 90% vegetarian. You are 100% not vegetarian. If you eat meat, that's not 90% vegetarian. He's an asshole. He's a convenient moral ground asshole who's just trying to let everybody know he's better than you because most of the time he doesn't eat meat. Just fuck you. Yeah, I'll just go ahead and shut the fuck up.

Speaker 5:          01:26:15       Well, he was just trying to be, make an argument against hunting and a about about people who do it. You know, it's just, he's a fool, but it's convenient for people because they're completely detached on, on a daily basis. If you go to your office every day, you wake up in the morning, you have your breakfast, you drive to work, you go to work. At the end of the day, you go to the gym, you go home, you watch a little television, you crash, you get up in the morning, you do that again and you do it five days a week. You're left with two fucking days, two days, Saturday and Sunday. If you're lucky. And if you have family, those days are spoken for. If you have friends, those days are spoken for. If you have hobbies, so where's your gathering food come from? Like you, you have to make a concerted effort.

Speaker 5:          01:26:54       If you really want to be a part of this, if you really want to deeply understand where your food comes from, you have to make a concerted effort to either grow it or acquire it. Like somehow or another you have to go to a farm and talk to the people that are growing the food and buy it from them. Go to a farmer's market. You can meet them like, I go to farmer's markets. It's kind of cool. I like meeting the people that work on the farms. I asked them to talk to them about it. But the meat thing is the big detachment. Everybody kind of understands. You plant a seed, you water it, tomato comes out, they kind of get that. But the animal part, the vast majority of people who eat meat just do not understand the whole process. They don't, they don't want to know.

Speaker 5:          01:27:36       They, they just buy a burger. Yeah. Uh, I'm starting to know a little bit more and it freaks me out of it. It's a freak out, but you know, it's a freak out. I haven't quite switched over to veganism or going out and hunting. Yeah, well, my thought was I was going to do one or two things. I was either going to become a Vegan, I was going to become a hunter. And I became a hunter. And one of the reasons why I became a hunter is, first of all, the food's delicious. It's good for you. And those animals aren't, they're not living forever. And I becoming fairies and curing cancer, if you don't shoot them and they're getting eaten by all kinds of shit around them, you're, you're just, you're just eating them as well. It's, um, it's a, it's a weird disconnect that we have about where food comes from.

Speaker 5:          01:28:25       And life itself, like live is not permanent. It's temporary. It's, it's here and it's gone. It's fleeting. It should be respected, you know, it should be. And I think one of the best ways to respect these animals in the sounds like total, totally counter intuitive, but as to cut them and eat them, they become a part of your life. They sustain you. They, you know, you, you have a deep appreciation for them because they literally sustain you there. Part of what makes you live. Yeah, that's, that's a real, yeah. We live in Texas, a lot of hunting and in Austin

Speaker 2:          01:29:02       when you were living there. And a lot of my friends, you know, they hunt and so you know that they're big on it. Um, did you ever want to go with them? I, I did, but I had a, I had a couple of experiences with guns when I was younger. That kind of freaked me out from, from that, one of them was me being a kid and I was like a play gun and I kind of colored the red, uh, like kids say she thing, you know, I, me and my buddies, so he had this like daisy rifle. I had this little lake, I don't remember what it was, but so we'd just like, we're just messing around, you know, actually my kids. And then this guy comes driving and we, it's the point that gun at him and this guy swerved off the road, hit some mailbox, like crashes his car.

Speaker 2:          01:29:59       He gets out, he's like, what the fuck are you guys doing? You know, I'm nine. He's like, what the fuck are you doing? You could have killed somebody. What the fuck? Why want to just like toys and you know what I mean? And, and his mom comes out freaking out and they didn't know that we did it. And My pops was something, you know, you've got to understand this, you know, life that here this is serious. You got to understand this guy didn't know that you, you're playing web. So it kind of freaked me out. And then, um, I went on one hunting trip and I had 22 and he kicked me in the shoulder. Pretty good. 22 kicks you and I'm not a 2012 gates. 12 beds. Yeah. Yeah. So yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:30:34       No, it was like, what? That's like saying, man, I shot this slingshot one time. I broke my hand up. No. Yes.

Speaker 2:          01:30:46       12 gauge shotgun and it kicked me pretty hard. And so I just kind of lost interest. But you know, that was, it was a long ass time ago. Suzanne from honey, honey and wants to go pig hunting. Yeah. So down she keeps bringing it up. She's like, why don't we go with Joe Rogan when we go on pig hunting? Yeah, she's totally down to do it. Definitely. You know, and my boy Mike, where he, that's what he does all the time. It was outside of, um, a little

Speaker 1:          01:31:10       outside of Austin. He's always gone sending me photos, sending me videos and, well, in Austin, like outside of Texas, they have a giant problem with pigs. They have to hunt them. You can, you can go to town on them. They're everywhere. Yeah. They have no limits. You can do it. They do it from helicopters. I mean, they have, they have a whole business called Hella hunting where they take people up in, in helicopters and they're shooting pigs because it's the only way to eradicate them from farms because there's so many of them and they do billions of dollars worth of damage just in Texas in crop destruction every year there are wild. I mean, there's not, there's not enough mountain mines and there's no wolves to kill them and realize there were so dangerous to, oh, they're very dangerous. The big ones especially, they'll fuck you up. That's what I heard. That's why I said, why I don't go out there. They'll fuck you up. They Killed The dad and game of, right.

Speaker 5:          01:32:00       The first king, the original king, the one who, uh, her husband, the chick who was fucking her brother and the game of thrones, the hot blonde lady. Her husband died because, uh, he got killed by a, by a pig. Wait, is this in the show? I don't know the shell game of throne. Not Real life. You didn't, I mean in the movie he died from a wild boar, but they get fucking big too. I mean, a 400 pound wild heart is not uncommon. That's real. I never seen with them in real life. They're crazy. Look and they're all black and they have long snouts in their tusks come out. They have these white tusks. Like when you see when it real life, you're like, oh, you hear him in real life. First time I ever went pig hunting, I was with my friend Steve Rinella and we're on this farm or this a ranch.

Speaker 5:          01:32:49       It's not far away from here. It's huge. Biggest ranch in California, 270,000 acres. It's called the home ranch. And um, we were walking down this road and we heard some snaps and some noises in the bushes, like it's really thick brush. And then we heard these pigs fighting with each other and they were like Damon's mass eye and they're like no more than 30 yards, 20 yards away from us. They're like right there and they're duking it out in the, and like these are monsters man. They sound like monsters. It freaked me out more than honey bears more than hunting elk but not more than elk. Elk is probably the biggest freak out cause they scream, they day bugle and they like a thousand pounds and they look majestically they have trees growing out of their head. These giant antlers. And then did you see the antlers that are in the front there over by the front door is locked in.

Speaker 5:          01:33:37       That's elk, those, those, that's like a thousand pound animal with these gigantic, I mean there they're immense, immense majestic animals. Those are the biggest freak outs. Just cause you feel like you're, you're hunting some mystical creature. Where do you find those? Those were into home ranch two. One of them was one of those was from to hone ranch. One of them was from Colorado, you know, rising. But the pig thing is, uh, it's actually look at that fucking thing, the size of that thing. 11 year old hunter bags, a 1050 pound wild boar. What the fuck? What the fuck? First of all with a pistol, this is a perspective shot, which is actually kind of important because like that boy is way behind that thing. He's not like right next to it. So if he's behind it by just, you know, six or seven feet and the camera's on the ground, they're shooting at an eye level.

Speaker 5:          01:34:31       It makes it look a lot bigger than it really is. That's how they do it. Um, so, but a thousand pounds is a fucking thousand pounds. That's a giant ass pig. If you ever seen Hogzilla have I seen it? If you've seen the images of Hogzilla, have you heard of this? This is like one of the biggest wild pigs who was ever killed. It was a, I believe it was in Georgia. Yeah. Is that, did they have a photo of Hogzilla check? There's one. It's hanging there. That one right there, Jeremy. Look at the size of the one that's hanging next to this guy. Look at the fucking size. That thing. So that's not a perspective shot. That guy standing right next to that thing. What? Yeah. What first of all are those his balls up a top. Cause if that's his balls. Respect. That's a crazy sack. That's like a couple of watermelons and an old ladies. Pantyhose. What? It's a giant fucking giant balls. How big was it? Over a thousand pounds?

Speaker 2:          01:35:34       Yeah. No, I know.

Speaker 5:          01:35:37       Wildly considered widely. Originally it was widely considered a hoax. Hmm. Well they, what happens is they take domestic pigs are one of the few animals that morph automatically when they get out into the wild. Like if you have a pig and he's your buddy and you let them loose out in the forest, they change physically. Their nose gets longer, their hair gets shaggier and their teeth grow along or their tusks grow and their behavior changes. They go feral and they go feral really quickly. I think within like a couple of months they start physical transformation. I didn't know that. Yeah, they're weird animal like wild boars and wild pigs. Like do you see a wild boar? Like dark hair, thick scrubby and then you see a pig like at a farm. Same species. Same animal, which is fucking nuts there that it's all one genus. It's called [inaudible]. That's the type of animal it is and they can interbreed with each other.

Speaker 5:          01:36:34       They're the same thing and that's why when you go see wild pigs like domestic pigs that get loose and they become feral and then they start breeding in the wild. They the, they're black, they're black. They have a thick, thick coat on the, around where their neck area is because they fight and they tear each other apart. So all around like from their face down to like a, where their heart is on their chest is super thick, thick, hide like the thickest fuck like a shoe, like the bottom of a shoe. It's incredible how thick it is. So um, people that hunt them, you have to be careful like with bows and arrows that you don't hit them in that area. Cause like if you have a weak bow know, pulling back a lot of weight with a really sharp Arrow, he won't even go through them.

Speaker 2:          01:37:16       Do you use a bow? Sometimes? Yeah, man, I had no idea is there's this girl, she works with this hat shop and uh, I walked in and she's got this pet fucking pigs. I could just imagine that thing like getting loose for a couple of months. Like have you seen my, was it a potbelly pig? One of those little ones? Uh, yeah. Is that the same deal? No, I don't think so. I think at potbelly pigs or like a, like a Chore Chihuahua,

Speaker 5:          01:37:47       the Chihuahua, the reality of domestic dogs is that domestic dogs all share, uh, genetics with a, which means somehow or another, we don't exactly know how they did it, but through selective breeding, a wolf became a Chihuahua.

Speaker 5:          01:38:06       Yeah. Well, you know, I was having this conversation with a buddy of mine in Australia of about how a Chihuahua became a Chihuahua. And what did he say we could, we didn't know. Oh, we were just like, that's how fucking crazy is that. Well, there's no clear map. It's not like, you know, like a lagger, you know, to lager is like a line mates with a tiger. It makes a logger. Just bad ass. Yeah. Pretty bad as well. They're also, they're so big because they want, it's either a, I think it's a male lion and a female tiger and, or maybe a male tigers and female line, but it has to be that specific combination. And what happens is when that combination takes place, they don't receive the gene that regulates size. So they keep growing.

Speaker 6:          01:38:57       Yeah.

Speaker 5:          01:38:58       They're sort of, they're enormous. They're way bigger than a lion and way bigger than a tiger. Like laggers are enormous. They, they don't even seem real. That's why they were in Napoleon dynamite's favorite animal. Yeah. Classic. A classic by the way. But see, that makes sense. Right? Align mates with a tiger, you can see that they have similarities in their features. Gotcha. But, um, chihuahuas and all domestic dogs, we don't really know. We, there's a lot of speculation and they believe that wolves became friendly with people because we're feeding them and then they become more docile. I, there was a radio lab podcast that talked about breeding foxes and within a decade they had killed, they were breeding foxes and they would kill any fox that showed any sort of aggression or any and that there was trying to be dominant with a growl at people that any, any, uh, any unfavorable characteristics, they killed them.

Speaker 5:          01:39:51       And within 10 years, the genes change to the point where all the foxes had droopy ears. Their jaws became less masculine, they became smaller, their behavior completely changed. They all became like a domestic pet. Within 10 years, they'd literally became a different thing. And so the thought is that this is what happened with wolves and that wolves being around campfires with people like primitive printer of people tens and 20,000, 40,000 years ago, that we slowly but surely started having relationships with these animals where they would protect us from the other wolves because we would feed them. And so they would become more docile and more, um, more dependent upon us. So they would, uh, they would be, they would give in, you know, they would, they would be submissive to us and so their ears started to flop like a dog's ear and you know, they became less aggressive.

Speaker 5:          01:40:45       They would respond to people, you could train them and teach them to hunt with you cause they got a reward out of being a part of the community of people. And then you would raise him from the time they're puppies and they'd be even more inclined to go like that. So someone find wolf puppies and raise them so they would imprint on people and be even more likely to exhibit those behaviors. Kind of heat for you hanging out with, to become a Chihuahua gay folk? Mostly some Mexicans. Um, I think, I think chihuahuas are just, it's just like thousands of years of that shit, you know, only selecting the smaller ones, only selecting the most docile, the most diminutive features. It's a good question now. Yeah. You know, when you get freaky with it, the real argument is that, um, it's very similar in fact to human beings. Human beings are the only animals that vary as much in their appearance as dogs. Like you had Shaquille o'neal and you've got bridget the midget. Those are both humans, right? How is bridget the midget or any or Brad Williams, how anybody who's got dwarfism, how are they different than an English bulldog?

Speaker 5:          01:42:02       Right? Yeah. In a way. I mean, it's some sort of a strange change in the body. And I don't mean this in any disrespectful way, I'm just trying to be completely objective about the physical form of these people. You know, I'm not saying that people purposely make dwarfs, but I'm saying that the physical characteristics that differences in, uh, an English bulldog and a wolf, and that's very like the difference in Karl Malone and Brad Williams. I mean there, those are both humans and they both could pregnant in pregnant, the same woman, like if a woman had a baby with Karl Malone and then a woman had a baby with a dwarf, like right afterwards, she still mean she can get pregnant from both of them and have a baby from both of them. And potentially the same genetic characteristics could be passed down live. The less likely with the dwarf.

Speaker 5:          01:42:49       But I mean, this is incredible when you think about the variation of human beings. We can get a little, a tiny, like a 90 pound Asian lady, and then you can have Sabrina Williams, this super athlete with giant muscles and just ridiculous explosive ability. Well, they're both female humans. You know, it's sort of like a, like a golden lab and a rottweiler. There's a both dogs, but they're massively different characteristics. Right? And that's why like really nutty conspiracy people believe that human beings are created by aliens and that much in the same way that human beings, uh, engineered dogs and change the shape and selectively bred them to the point where they became these little chihuahuas. That's what aliens did with human beings. They came down, they found some chimpanzees and some lower hominids and started injecting their DNA into him. And slowly but surely created a series of different styles of, of human being. I've heard this before, but with the vote with the, but with the dog

Speaker 1:          01:43:52       comparison. Yeah. Yeah. I don't know man. I don't know either. And I'm not, I don't, I don't buy the, uh, alien thing. I think it's much more likely it was just different climates and different parts of the world. There were isolated from each other. And so I think you think he's like, you know, built bread, adapt to your situation. Yeah, sure. Yeah, no doubt. You know, I mean, there's, there's characteristics that animals exhibit that similar animals and other, uh, other climates don't like African elephants for example. They have enormous ears because it displaces heat. Large surface areas displace heat better. It's also why a lot of African men are very tall, very tall and long because it's, it's easier displace heat over large surface area, right? Yeah. So like Asian elephants of different ears than African elephants do. Right. Wooly mammoths of much smaller ears because they were dealing with cold, cold climates.

Speaker 1:          01:44:54       Whereas elephants, you know, in Africa when they're in the hot savannah's they have these giant ass fucking he hears. That makes sense. I mean, speaking from my thoughts and my personal experience, I'm definitely much better off in warmer climates than I am in cold mountains. Are you it feel it can't do it, man. Can't do it. Can't do it. Don't you get used to it though? I mean, no, no, no, no, no. I just feel it in your bones. Yeah. I don't like it. Like, I don't like this. I need to get over away from this. You know, like if it's hot, I'm like, okay, guy's cool, but not cold is like, Eh, Eh, Eh, Eh, eh. Yeah. Get away. We'll also growing up in Austin work, it's hot as fuck. Yeah, definitely. So yeah, I did the New York thing couldn't deal with winters. No Dude, no, cause I'm thinking about, I'm thinking about all the times where I busted ass and you know, so it's like walking across the street and I stepped in and what I think is snow and it's like underneath is like a foot of water and you know, I'm just walking around and you know, I've got one wet foot and I'm supposed to be going to some fucking event or something and I go to dinner or do whatever.

Speaker 1:          01:46:15       I just, I can't, I can't do it. I mean I can, you know, I don't want to sound like a pussy or anything, but I can't do it. Well you can, but you don't want to. There it is. I don't want to, I fucking don't want to. Why should you have to? I don't. That's why I'm [inaudible] options. Exactly. Like if the whole world was New York City, you could do it. You could do it. It's definitely better than not living. No, that's true. That's very true. I could do it, but you know that there's a better spot. Right. I could adapt if I didn't know any better. I get it down, but here you are in the best spot. Exactly. When comes to weather, nobody can fuck with La. That's true. That's very true. That's why so many of us, it's what Jamie's here. Look at him.

Speaker 1:          01:46:57       He's like, he's from Columbus, Ohio. Really? Yeah. Columbus, Ohio gives New York City that eight out in the breaks. As far as, that's a pool term, like it's a spot. It's a spot of your plane. 10 Ball. He gives some of the eight out in the breaks. That means if they spot, if they win, they can win. If they make the eight ball, the nine ball or the 10 ball and they could break every touching, that's eight out in the breaks. That's a considerable, considerable handicap. Gotcha. I would say pull a little bit, but I don't. Columbia, I've been to Columbus before. We've got this cool little venue. I played that. Columbus is great. Yeah, it's nice. It's a great town. They're cool people. They're man. It's a fun, it's a fun town. I liked Columbus a lot and haven't spent a lot of times now about, he definitely had a good time. I haven't been there since. I shot my special there in 2009 that's what Dick I am. Where was that in one southern theater. Once that the uh, oh that's right. That's right. That's right. Jamie knows my schedule better than me when I started working with, that's ridiculous. Jamie, how do I, how do you know this? And I don't know this. That was like 2011 or 12 right? To tell them 12 yeah. Columbus is a cool town. That's like my favorite town in a, in Ohio.

Speaker 7:          01:48:11       Ooh.

Speaker 1:          01:48:13       Where else is there in Ohio? Like did you Cleveland Cleveland's not bad. Cleveland. Cincinnati is fun, but Cincinnati that bullshit you, he's got the Cincinnati airport in Kentucky. I don't like that. Why? Well, because it's insecure. The Kentucky people are insecure. They should call it the fucking Kentucky airport. Cause that's what it is. God dammit. Toledo, Cincinnati assholes claim your city. Wait, but how does that even exactly. The Cincinnati Airport is actually in Kentucky. But to get people to fly into Kentucky is problematic because people have, they have massive prejudice against Kentucky. Man. It just sounds like hillbillies were as Cincinnati is like wk Rp, you know, it's like a Loni Anderson and fucking everybody's having a good time. Right. You know, Cincinnati sounds like a nice city, right? Well it's fucking right next door to Kentucky. So close that you land in Kentucky and then you drive to Cincinnati.

Speaker 1:          01:49:10       So they name the fucking Cincinnati airport. This Kentucky airport. That's pretty good. That's pretty good. One sneaky sneaky mother fuckers. They did it for people like us. I've never going to go to Kentucky. I fucking got me. I swore I'd never come into this buts. But meanwhile there's like Louisville where everybody goes like, it doesn't make any sense. You know, with the Kentucky Derby is in Louisville, right? Yeah. See that's like everybody goes there, but it's one of those quaint southern destinations. You know, I liked the word quaint make too. Yeah. Ah, I spent a little bit of time running around. They're fun. Like the, um, it's the wildest crowds and kind of like in that area. And so for me, I think that's interesting for me. I wonder why. I wonder why that is. Booze. Uh, I think, yeah, I mean, boots happens everywhere, but I feel like, yeah, people really have a good time.

Speaker 1:          01:50:11       Well, when I started going on the road a lot in the 90s, is when I really understood Nascar. They got never got Nascar. I'm like, cool, the fuck is watching this. It's not that I didn't like car racing. It's like, who the fuck is watching these people go around in a circle? And then I would see how big it was. I would read statistics. I was like, Bull Shit. These fucking statistics are all made up. No one's watching this. And then, uh, I did a radio station, um, I wanna say it was in Atlanta. I don't remember where it was, but I remember, uh, it was in the south and the guy was like, yeah,

Speaker 5:          01:50:42       did you see the race this weekend? Man, Dale Jr's really fucking putting it to them, but me. I was like, what are you talking about? And like Nascar, Tony Stewart, and he starts naming all these people. I'm like, I don't know who the fuck you're talking about. And he was flabbergasted that I did know who these Nascar people were. And then I didn't know who won the look and talent cus Calusa five, five, five 60 or whatever the fuck name of the race it was. He was, he was flabbergasted. And I was like, how many people know? So then we had people call in like that knew a lot about nascar while I was on the air. I was like, you guys know a lot about Nascar. How many people? We watch it every weekend and they'll be like going crazy about nascar. I was like, oh, okay. So this is a geographical for go

Speaker 1:          01:51:23       cultural thing that I'm just not privy to. I just don't understand it. Mm. Yeah. Uh, we got a little bit of taste of that and in Texas kind of bled over a little bit, but Austin has a formula one race that's very new. But how is it, how old is that? Well, I guess, I don't know. I'm new enough. Yeah, a few years have passed I guess. But yeah, the f one, uh, that's the shit, man. That's a different kind of racing. And that's my style of racing. I love watching Formula One cars. It's turns and craziness and strategy and you know, that's, that seems like some crazy shit. Yeah. I can get more into that, but yeah, I didn't know shit about Nascar either. Yeah. Yeah. But, you know, different things. It's definitely a cultural deal. I was driving through, you know, Alabama and you know, the south and everything and it's theirs, you know, uh, tracks and everything, you know, for amateurs and it's, it's just like a big culture, I guess. You know, it's a big deal for those folks. And they say that all came out of souping up their cars for moonshine runs. I can believe it. Yeah, it makes sense. Right? I get to get in and get out of there. Yeah. Get this money, get the six, which all came from the same thing that we're dealing with, with, with psychedelics suppression.

Speaker 5:          01:52:46       Right. I mean, suppression creates diamonds. I mean that's, that's what created that kind of racing is people trying to figure out a way to get the fuck away from cops. So they made cars that drove faster, handled better, and they could just get away from cops. And that was the whole dukes of hazard. That's why they had the general Lee. They weren't involved in braces. They were running away from cops. They had some crazy souped up. Fuck it. That's why they couldn't have guns. They always had bows and arrows because the cops had taken their, their ability to have a firearm away. When you're a felon in this country, you can't own a gun anymore.

Speaker 2:          01:53:15       Right. I understand. A little bit. This podcast turned weird, right? Yeah. It was a weird one. A little bit. It was a good one though, man. Yeah.

Beautiful Chris Stapleton and Bonnie Raitt.
