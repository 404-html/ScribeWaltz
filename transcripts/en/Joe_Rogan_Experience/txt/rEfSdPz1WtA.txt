Speaker 1:          00:00:00       Yeah. And we're live, ladies and gentlemen, Lance Armstrong. How are you buddy? Good man. Thanks. Thanks for doing this. Appreciate it. Thanks for having me. I really appreciate it. For your frill. And, um, you know, you were just telling me before this, uh, we were talking about social media and social media. The greatest part about social media as he get in contact with everybody, the worst part about social media is that you get in contact with everybody. And it was just this tiny percentage of people that won't let it rest. Like I was looking at something that you posted and uh, it was something about some, like you had a great time doing some race and like one of the first tweets, one of the first comments was, uh, yeah, as good at times running away from drug toasts are, yeah, that's right. You're, you're just going to have, what did we, I'm at posted the other day.

Speaker 1:          00:00:48       We were, we were, we were putting our Christmas tree up and my family, you know, they all the kids there and Anna and the lights and the, and the ornaments and it's at the fucking Christmas tree. And you know, of course most people love it. They think it's a cute picture. But then there's always the one, you know, the tree is the tree juiced or, or something. I mean, there's just always, which I get, I mean that's just part of it, but sometimes you're like, is that the best we got? Like, yeah. I mean maybe that is, maybe I deserved, I dunno. But it's like give it a rest sometimes. Well, you definitely deserve some of it, right? Yeah, for sure. There's no way around of course this, but it's also, I think one of the things about this whole scandal, the whole thing, it illuminated the real issue and the real issue is the entire, and this is what we're talking about.

Speaker 1:          00:01:36       Bill Byrd did that thing on Conan or he was saying, look, the fucking whole sport is like this. It's not, there was all the people that won the Tour de France and all the years that you did it. If you go back to people that either weren't implicated or didn't test positive, like what is it, like 18th place or something fucking crazy like that, you know, that that's probably generous. I, yeah, right. It would be, um, it would be hard to know, hard to know that. And um, I mean they, look, Joe, these are all easy for me to, to sit here and say and talk about. And people would say, well, of course he says that. Right? Of course he thinks that talks on the table now you really don't have anything to get it, but is it, it is. No, I mean it's, um, well I guess it is, but you know, people don't want to talk about that.

Speaker 1:          00:02:30       I mean, people want to talk about my issue and that's, I guess also understandable. Um, but like it was a, it was a fucked up time. And, and you had this, you were at this crossroads of have a very hard sport, uh, I very hard event. Some would say one of the hardest sporting events in the world, three weeks, 2,500 miles, conditions, terrain, et Cetera, et cetera. So that meets really the perfect drug. When you have a drug that's, that's incredibly beneficial and at the totally undetectable, um, and, and everybody dove in. And so, um, nobody, nobody, nobody wanted to be in that position. It's not like any of us growing up as kids thought, dude, I'm going to, I'm going to go to Europe and get all doped up and tried to went packers. No, nobody wanted to be there. Like, we all went with pure intentions.

Speaker 1:          00:03:22       We got there and we're like, and I'm talking about to this crop of Americans that went to Europe and the shit was messy. And we're like, whoa. Like, okay, do we go home or do we stay in fight? And, uh, literally, uh, almost everybody stayed and fought and they fought. We fought the way that, that the fight was being fought. And um, you know, and, and that all meets with where we are today. And the people who were there, I think can speak to it. Me and my teammates, my peers, my rivals, the competition. Um, and we have a unique perspective on it because we were, we were in the war, but the person on main street, right, the corner of main and first wasn't there and they don't understand it. And so they can't really speak to it, but that doesn't change the fact that they're disappointed. They're, they're really disappointed. That disappointed me, that disappointing the sport. Uh, they might hate me, they might hate the sport. Um, then they were most likely defenders of mine. And so they're pissed off. And I, you know, it's taken me a long time to really understand that. Um, but I'll spend the rest of my life trying to, trying to work that one out with that person. And I, and I don't, you know, they're out there, they're millions of them, so, um,

Speaker 2:          00:04:45       well they have a legitimate point. But there's also, there's people out there that want you to be wrong and want you, they want to find someone who's done something bad and never let it go. And I think there's, there's definitely some of that going on. And there's also people that they don't have a lot of sympathy for people who've been extremely successful. And I've made mistakes. Like it gives them the green light to just decide to just continually attack you. But if I, when I tried to do, when this whole thing was going down, as I tried to put myself in your position, like you're this worldclass biker, it's 1994 and that's right around when you started using [inaudible] 95 95. So around this time, when you realize what those 20 years ago, 20 years ago, it's kind of crazy, right? When you realize that this, that pretty much all the best guys, we're doing this now. What is that feeling like when you're like, okay, I've got a crossover into this deceptive territory. Now all of a sudden I'm, uh, I have to lie about this. I have to hide this and have to be a part of this sort of underground thing, this underground aspect that's a part of great sport,

Speaker 1:          00:05:58       right? Well, W we, we held off as long as you know, I mean, uh, you know, epl came along in the early nineties. Um, we SORTA got to Europe in [inaudible] 92 93. Um, and then it, it by that point, by nine fords, you know, full on and we're thinking, okay, this isn't good, but surely they're going to have a test for this free flow. Um, and we waited, we waited and it just never came. And then, uh, then we get to 95. There's tremendous pressure on the team within the team. Uh, we're losing the sponsor. Will the sponsor renew? The team wants results and we're going, all right, we're, we're really fucked here. And so we all collectively made the decision in spring of [inaudible] 95 that, all right, we have to go play ball the first time you shot that stuff. What was that like? That it's not, it's, it's, it's not like a, I knew you were going to ask these questions.

Speaker 1:          00:07:03       It's not like that. It's not that type of drug. It's not like, no, I don't mean like cocaine or, or it's not, it's not, it's not, I didn't mean it that way. I met was there a feeling like, God, fuck, we've crossed into this land of cheating. It was so long ago and that would have been, that was 21 years ago or 20 years ago. It's a little tough to remember exactly. Um, um, you know, it also too, I mean it wasn't as if there were other things we did before that, I mean their eco is, is this hugely powerful drug. But, but there was, you know, we sort of, uh, call them gateway drugs. I mean, if, if, if, if people is, you know, is, is the myth of performance enhancing drugs. I mean there's, there's marijuana too. There's, there's a lighter sort of entry level stuff that, what was the entry, what was the first time cortisone?

Speaker 1:          00:07:52       Is, is there another is to relieve pain or just, uh, yeah, I mean it is, but it also works for, for racing bikes. But how does it work for racing bikes? Um, well, it's such a strong anti-inflammatory that you, with that you just inevitably, you feel better. Whether it's physically you feel better, a certain, even just a euphoria that comes with that. That's, you know, and who knows what, you know, percent of it, but at the same time you have, you have a drug that, um, you know, I love it when you, when you know, in cycling, if you took cortisone, you, you would be, it would be banned. However you under your watch, you know, the NFL and then somebody gets, gets banged up in the first half. They go in at halftime, they come out, you know, the announcer says they went in and they got it. They got a cortisone injection. There'll be, they're going to play the second half. They rest for a hundred yards. They win the game, their hero. It's like, wait a second. Yeah. Like, so it is what it is, but it is weird. It's weird what we've

Speaker 2:          00:08:56       talked about that a bunch of times. Me and my friends, like when you go to Gnc or you know, like the UFC has this company, uh, muscle farm which sells a bunch of supplements and things along those lines, but yet they ban performance enhancing drugs. Like, well what are these supplements do? Well, they enhance you some way, like a certain level. Well we'll allow, allow a certain level of improvement, certain level of aid in recovery. But anything past that as cheating,

Speaker 1:          00:09:25       well it's all performance. A nap, his performance in his short vitamins. So we know that. Right? But, but they're also a two has to be, and I don't want to be critical of whether it's the UFC is efforts to, to combat doping or are you sought or water or the anybody or any major sport. You have to draw the line somewhere. That's just, and I get asked that all the time because people, people get frustrated with the issue and it's, they kind of throw their hands up and said, well look, we should just, it should just all be legal. And, you know, they said that to me and they're, they're thinking I'm going to go, yeah, you're right. But you can't, that's not the answer either. There has to be a structure in place. There has to be aligned. And it might, that line might seem weird or fuzzy to people sometimes, but shit, you have to have something. Um, and so dude, it's tricky. I mean, anytime you mix, uh, athletes that are, that are super motivated with, um, with money, with a pressure that comes with that temptation that comes with that. You know, people are for the rest of, I mean, come on. I mean, the original Olympic Games they were, there were there was going on. So it's, you have to think that it's going to happen forever. It, the substances will change over time. But, um, it just, unfortunately, it's part of the game.

Speaker 2:          00:10:45       So the original writers like way back in the early days of the Tour de France, before they had drugs, they were using alcohol.

Speaker 1:          00:10:52       You know, there's all the, there's a lot of stories about, um, whether it's alcohol, cocaine, um, and crazy substances. But, but at the same time you had guys, the Tour de France is a hundred years old, right? So, uh, doping is cheating. We know that. But there's other ways. I mean, guys would hang on to cars, guys would get in trains. They were guys, they would take a cork out of, out of a wine bottle and they would put this is this fucking crazy? They would have fishing string in the cork, right? So wired up and they would have it, you know, they have a car off the road and they'd put it in the neuro cheat. Oh my. And you know, just a subtle pole. I mean, did they, you know, any way to get ahead? I mean, this is, you know, the, the, um, the sport is just that it's a brutal sport and you're not getting your face pounded in like ufc, but you certainly feel like you're getting your face pounded.

Speaker 2:          00:11:46       Well, psychologically it's almost more devastating cause it's so grinding when you're talking about something that three weeks and he goes, is it 2100 2,500 miles? Is that what it is? 2,500. That's insane. That's an insane amount of time pushing your body

Speaker 1:          00:12:02       a hundred miles a day. But once you get to the top level, it's remarkable how efficient it is. I mean, you have 200 guys going down the road on a normal day. If it's a flat day and there's not wind or crosswind, um, or rain or you know, the conditions, it's pretty easy to be honest. I mean, it's conversational. The final is tough on the final gets fast and people are competing for the stage went. But, um, it's not, you know, those three weeks aren't like three weeks on the law. I mean, on, you know, in the red line. So you have to pace yourself. The peloton paces itself, like the, you know, they sort of pace and police for, for lack of a better word itself. And when, you know, obviously the mountains and the time trials or where the race is decided and those are the hardest moments

Speaker 2:          00:12:48       when they first started introducing, uh, things like, um, uh, when I started using the transfusions and things along those lines, how much of an improvement did it have on the times?

Speaker 1:          00:12:59       Well, you know, it's, it's, it's hard to say because the Times that, you know, people look at our era, they look at my generation and they say, okay, well the time supposed to be, you know, significantly faster and be immediately, but you can't compare cycling to track and field or cycling to another sport that's had had a rough patch and is now trying to clean itself up because technology changes, road surfaces change. Obviously training has changed. But um, I mean if you go back to the 84 games right here in Los Angeles, that was really the first major exposure you had for, for transfusions, um, which, which the American team did in rolling stone exposed it. Um, but uh, transfusion is just a, it was an old school hipo replace that, right? Because you had a transfusion is just adding red sales to your system, which carries oxygen and, and gives you more oxygen.

Speaker 1:          00:13:55       Then you had a drug came along that did that for you. So you didn't have to extract the blood. You didn't have to put it back in. It made it, you know, it made it a lot easier. And then when the test, when they refined the protest and ultimately came up with it, um, uh, then people went back to the old school system. So, um, and then came other ways to detect that through not so much through a test, but just through what they call the biological passport. So just studying parameters and your blood, whether it's ridiculous sites or red cells or you know, all of these things that the smart people can come up with tests for. That's, it was more of a screening method to detect, uh, a transfusion. What's Kinda fucked up about all this is that

Speaker 2:          00:14:42       you won the Tour de France seven times. You obviously trained like a demon, pushed yourself to the limits. You beat everyone in the competition and they were all doing the same thing you were doing right. Yet you're the one who was demonized and yet you're the one who takes all the grief.

Speaker 1:          00:14:59       Yup. Yeah. And

Speaker 2:          00:15:02       there's a situation that happens when you're involved. You're involving money, you're involving sponsors, you're involved. When you, once you first start, once the ball starts rolling and the first deception has been launched out there into the ether. Yup. There's no way to take it back if you want to keep racing. Yup. Yep.

Speaker 1:          00:15:21       And that's the thing. I mean people look, I mean my situ, my story and, and I, I hear you loud and clear and you can say that. I can never say that. You know, when I, when I, if I were to say things like that, people would, they would nuke me. But it is what it is, what it is. But that's anyhow, um, there was the doping, okay. Which led to the lying. Right. Which led to the treatment of other people. I think by and large, people can have the perspective that you have. They can say, well, looks to me like everybody did it. So, okay. Uh, then they can look to the line and they, that's where they really start to not like it. I said, this guy lied to us repeatedly, but of course you get, you know, my, there's no defense to that.

Speaker 1:          00:16:04       But if I could, if I could share any personal insight. I mean, once you lie, once you just keep lying to keep lines. Not as if I'm going to sit here, you know, this is 15 years ago and Joe, you're a nice guy and you, I mean, if I was on this podcast, I would lied to your fucking face a million times. Just so you know, I would've just shown you now, just so you know. But that's not a surprise to you or anybody else, but, but once you're in there, it's not as if I'm going to go, you know, this, this guy joe seems like a really nice guy. I think I'm going to be real. I'm gonna be honest with him. Too much money. There's no way you can't once that. Yeah. So I was, I was stuck, for lack of a better word in that, uh, in that, does that lie or that deception?

Speaker 1:          00:16:47       But then the way that I took my competitive nature, which served me well in training and in racing, and took it into the real world, took it into a press conference, took it into a personal relationship, took it into former teammates. Uh, my relationship with that, what, that's the part where people go, okay, fuck this guy forever. Right? I'm done. And so, um, that, you know, you've got sort of the three phases. None of them are good, but as it got further away, um, that, um, you know, lack of respect for others is the thing that totally fucked me. And you know, too, that I would, I would say to anybody that I understand and, um, I may be in their timeout forever. Um, I have, uh, and the only thing I will add that, that, that may sound like I'm trying to defend myself as I've, I've tried to make amends with all those people, right?

Speaker 1:          00:17:41       The ones that we all know, the ones people talk about, I've traveled the world, I've sat with them, I've, I've looked them in the eyes and said what I did was totally unacceptable and I'm sorry. Um, and almost everybody has accepted the apology and, and, and we've moved on. Um, but that doesn't get to this, this, you know, this crowd of people that, that you can't sit with face to face and you can't say you're sorry. I mean, I can talk to you, we can talk about it. Some people may view that as an apology or are or not, but, but the ones that I could go sit with, I did. And that's all that I would add to that. And I, and I, and I, I mean, I'm proud that most of those people, and I say most, not everybody, because not everybody's ready, but most of those people said, you know what?

Speaker 1:          00:18:25       We're good. We're done. And so, uh, if it was my son and he acted that way, first of all, I'd say, the fuck are you doing? You can't act that way. But I had no, nobody was standing over me going, dude, what? What are you, you're acting like an asshole. Nope. Nobody did that. So, but if my son did that, I would say you get over there and you make it right with that person. So that's where it is. And uh, here we go. You're also in this bizarre position at the time to be the only famous cycler and the entire country cyclist cycler isn't on it. That's a cycler cycling drugs, hiker, biker, but a bikers like sons of anarchy and that's, yeah. Yeah. I kind of got burned out on that series. But um, yeah, I mean the story weight to carry around.

Speaker 1:          00:19:16       Yeah. And then there's the cancer organizations live strong. All of it has a lot of weight you're carrying around. I speak to it all the time. I mean it was, it was a huge wave, but you're also balancing out so much good with this lie and this lie is helping. All is good, right? Like the live strong foundation is generating hundreds of millions of dollars helping all these people with cancer. I've seen you in the hospitals with these kids and it makes it mean me having kids myself, it makes me cry seeing these kids with face masks on because their immune system, so compromise and they don't have any hair and they're just devastated. And you're hanging out with these kids and you, you're generating all this positive energy for them, generating all this money, all this, all this research that's being funded. So there's all this good as well.

Speaker 1:          00:20:01       You start telling the truth that stopped. We know what happens because it happened. Yeah. It did happen. It happened to, and we dried up. I don't see any of those fucking bracelets anymore. No, Goddamn, things were everywhere. Yeah. Yeah, they were. We had a good run and 85 million bracelets. Yeah. But look, I mean, I don't want anybody to be mistaken. I, my interests were selfish. I mean, I was, uh, uh, um, defending myself and protecting myself. Uh, but at the same time, it wasn't just myself. I was protecting, I was protecting the sport. I was protecting our sponsors. I was protecting the tour. I was protecting the foundation. Um, and, you know, it's just hard to say I'm going to, I'm going to stop and, and, and, and what we just said. I mean, we now know on all of those things, right? We know what's happened to the foundation. We know what's happened to the sport, we know what's happened to the sponsor. We know, and we can now see. Um, it was, it was a devastating tall and, um, you know, most would say, well, that's all your fault lance. And, uh, and, and maybe they're right, but, uh, it's, it's been, you know, did it, especially on the foundations I did, it just breaks my heart to see that, um, the effect it's had on their effectiveness,

Speaker 2:          00:21:20       well, it's got to be way more complicated then. It's just your, all your fault. It's, it's, it's way more complicated because when you're talking about and tire sport, that's dirty. I mean, for lack of a better word, an entire sport that's being deceptive entire sport that's using these performance enhancing drugs. And then you're talking about you because you're this weird outlier here. This one guy who is incredibly successful at it in a country where nobody gave a fuck about the Tour de France until you came along. I mean, he's Greg Lamon you. Yeah. You know, I mean there's, yeah, I mean, that's it. That's the only,

Speaker 1:          00:21:56       this is the, I mean, the story in the story being what it was a cancer survivor that comes back that when's this event the transcends the sport that brings a sport to psych. And although greg to do, I mean a tremendous job really, that was like the first blow up of cycling and the United States and then comes my story. I mean, that's, the story was soap. The story was too big, right? I mean, and that's the reason that, that uh, that incentivized and motivated people like, uh, like Novitsky and like the feds to come along and say, oh,

Speaker 2:          00:22:30       a hundred percent, hundred percent. I mean, they're not, they're not doing that to save the world. They're not doing that to save the children no matter what. Ulterior motives that they might, you know, try to list as well. We wanted to make sure the children don't do this. We wanted to send a great message. We have bullshit. It's, it's a high profile, high publicity v Avenue for them to achieve notoriety.

Speaker 1:          00:22:52       Yeah. But, but, right. And we will get into that. But the, the, you know, my rival, so if you take, you know, my main main, main rivals, whether it's young, old rick or Baso are bulkier been tawny or their star factor, for lack of a better phrase, was just, was just different. And they, you know, they weren't cancerous wasn't, so it, it, there was this disparity which the sport enabled there to be because it just kind of an old school, Janky sport in terms of the way it's organized and run as a business. Um, that it, it was like a, you know, like a South American economy. There was really the haves and the have nots. And uh, that's a crazy way of putting it. Yeah. I mean, when, when you have something like that, it doesn't work. And so what you need to, you know, all of those ships need to rise with that. See. And, and, um, I probably didn't do a good enough job, uh, trying

Speaker 2:          00:23:46       to push for that in my, in my time. Um, but don't you have only a certain amount of resources? I mean, with, one of the things that I've always said about extreme winters is, uh, there's, there's a borderline between greatness and madness and he crosses back and forth. Yeah. I would say the greatest and madness are next door neighbors and they borrow each other's sugar because there's almost no way you can get that good without almost losing your fucking mind. Yeah. Right. I haven't met some people that are fantastic at things, the great ones. I've met great ones, especially great fighters, and they're all fucking crazy. Yeah. It's almost like you can't, you can't not be because every, you can't be a regular guy and get there. Right. I probably was. I probably still am a little crazy. Oh, you're crazy. I couldn't tell you.

Speaker 2:          00:24:30       Definitely crazy. No, but I don't, I don't think you're bad. I don't think you're a bad guy. I mean, I don't know you that well, but I, I just think you have to have that, that sharpness. Yeah. You have to have that, that grit. You have to have that aggressive competitive nature in order to succeed. Especially in some fucking thing where everyone's doing the same thing. There's not a lot of creativity involved. There's not a lot of the variables. You're fucking pushing yourself and the machine yourself. You're pumping your legs. That's it. You can't, you know, can't fake to the left and go to the ride. He can't fucking throw up some new moves that no one's ever seen before. You're, you're, you're fucking wishing yourself. Yeah. You definitely had some of those, but at the end of the day, you're on a fucking bike and everybody else is on a bike and you're going up the Goddamn same hill and there were no secrets.

Speaker 2:          00:25:15       Right. The Dat, dat concentrates down what the competitive nature is to like the edge. Who's got the sharper edge? Who's more intense and you John, because of that and, right. He's getting riled up. I get riled up, dude. It was, I'm gonna step back. Don't, don't, don't jump across this table. I mean, isn't that a big old Kettlebell over here? You should come over here. Just settle down. Isn't that what it is? That it has to be what it is. It's the only way to win. It's, it's an endurance event so you have to be a little careful with that. But there are those moments where you just have to unleash everything you have and you're going to unleash them in training or an in racing and yet, but yes, that seems like a really good point where you just put that up is there's, you have to be careful with that.

Speaker 2:          00:25:59       You have to know when to put like how you have to know your body like really intimately as far as you didn't, you have to manage it over the course of many, many women say the marathon, I mean nobody takes off and you know, like it's a hundred yard dash. I mean you have to manage that. Obviously you have the experience of knowing what that effort is going to look and feel like and you know how to manage all of that. But yeah, I mean three weeks long, man, you've gotta be, you gotta be careful. Yeah. Is there a moment where you remember like during the race where you wanted to push but you had to back down like there was, is there moments where you like you're managing don't have it, but yeah. Where you feel like this is not a smart thing to go. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:26:44       And you know, now you can, I mean, when we raised, you know, well in the old days people just drained and they thought, well, I'm gonna go hard today and I'm going to go easy tomorrow. And then it came the heart rate monitor and they followed their heart rate and they met, you know, they manage their training or racing through that and then came the power meters. And then so now there's all these, you know, there are these devices where you can really monitor all of that stuff. And so you're out there, you're not just sort of driving around blind. I mean, you actually can see what you're doing and you, and that makes managing that effort a lot easier.

Speaker 3:          00:27:16       What is it, what are the differences in the numbers? Like if you go back to like a hundred years ago, well, you assuming that people weren't using corkscrews and or corks and fishing line and whatever other ways she didn't. Yeah. Like what, what is like a realistic difference between the early days of winning and to just,

Speaker 1:          00:27:34       it's like a modern site clean. I mean, you have to look at when, when, you know, the bike basically got to the, you know, the bikes and the wheels and these things got to where they are today. And, um, you know, they're, uh, they're fast now. I mean, these guys are fast and that's the, you know, two things have happened. Number One, my story, uh, got exposed. And so then people question everybody, whether it's Chris froome who won the Tour de France this year, or somebody that wins the world championships, they questioned them because of me. And then they say, well, okay, well, you know, he's dirty. It seems like everybody's dirty, so you must be dirty. And then they go to the times, right? They look at, they look at, uh, they look at my times in the Tour de France and they look at the Peloton is times and they see now that the times are actually either the same or better.

Speaker 1:          00:28:18       So I said, well, then of course that that supports my argument that you're dirty, you know, how's it? Well, if it's fat, I mean, I don't know. I mean it, it, I don't have the answer to that. And I, and I, you know, I get asked all the time what's going on now or what's, I said, I have no idea. I mean, I'm so far removed from cycling that I have no earthly idea of what's going on or not going on. But I don't think it's necessarily fair to blame those guys. I don't, I understand it, but, um, you know, shit, I mean, you could have these athletes might be a lot better. The training might be a lot better. I do think technology, the bikes, the wheels, even road surfaces are a lot better. And

Speaker 3:          00:28:58       is there a, is there any part of you that's kind of pissed off that there are performance enhancing drugs? Like if there was nothing and if we just had to be Mano a Mano,

Speaker 1:          00:29:09       same result, you would have the same result. I would have this, it is my belief that

Speaker 3:          00:29:14       that the results would be the same. There'll be a few seconds slower or whatever, whatever it would be.

Speaker 1:          00:29:19       It doesn't matter if the overall time slower. What matters is, is, is if you were five minutes ahead of the next guy, that's what matters. That's what matters. I, that's my belief. But there are others that don't hold that belief. There are others that say no, I mean doping effects other individuals differently. And you know, you, you wouldn't know. You might have one, two or you might've went none. What does that mean is that some people weren't doping correctly, but look at once you're doping, if you're doping and the other guy's doping better than you, like, well then you're not doing your job doping. You know, you're not being a good competitive doper bill. But I mean, that's really what it is, right? I mean, doesn't it make sense? Uh, it's, it gets complicated. And W we would talk forever and, and people would argue with us forever about that.

Speaker 1:          00:30:04       So they're not here, you know, I mean, just who they are if you're listening. But my perspective is, is really clear on that. I mean, I think if you have a sport where everybody's, you know, we were both talking about the bill birth thing that he did on Conan, which is like, yeah, our psychopath is Beth and you're a psychopath. You know? That's, that's really what it is. You, you can't say that. I mean, how could they take away, this is one of the things that drove me the craziest about this. Like what did they do with the seven years where you one where they said, you're not the winter anymore. Well, who the fuck wanted then that's, you know, how do you, how do you find the guy who wanted show? That's, that's, that's a problem. What's in the record books. That's it. It's empty.

Speaker 1:          00:30:48       Empty, empty, empty for seven years. Yeah. That's ridiculous. Look, I you you, I agree with you, but you can say that I cannot say that. All I will say is that I don't, I don't think it's far be it for me to talk about what's fair or not fair, but I don't think it's fair for the sport to leave those empty. I think that's crazy. And, and compare and contrast. So when the tour, you have the Yellow Jersey, he's the guy who wins. You have the Polka Dot Jersey is technically the best climber. And then you have the Green Jersey who was technically the best sprinter. Those seven years were the Green Jersey was one by Zabul who admitted to having dope all seven of those years. The polka Dot Jersey was, was was one by veranique from France who admitted to having dumped all those years, those all stand, everything's still there.

Speaker 1:          00:31:40       That's hilarious. But the Yellow Jersey has been erased, you know, second place, third place. All those places are still there. The years, the years prior to me where it's somebody was, he had admitted or was caught all still there. So there's just an asterisk in first place. You go to Wikipedia, it's just there's just a line through it. Yeah. That's so strange. That's the word, man. It's strange. It's very strange. And it's strange for me and I it, and it makes me, it makes me sad because, um, uh, I'm gonna look, I'm gonna be honest. I believe I won the races. Um, and I think, well, no, you did win the races. Now you won the race. People to ask are the ones that got beat. Yeah. So if you ask them, right, if you're asking Keon if you asked to do a left, he asked, uh, below.

Speaker 1:          00:32:27       If you ask any of them, they say he won those bike races. And so, man, it, it, it, you still have those yellow jerseys in your house and I'd have to give them back. No, good. Fuck them. She put it on an instagram picture of him every day. That was, yeah, that, yeah. I'm not going to put that picture up again, but that was a great picture though. Oh, you chilling on the couch at seven yellow jerseys on your wall. I got, I got a note for that one. Wow. You're going to get new no matter what you do. But, but I, I look, I mean, they're up. They're up and, uh, and, and I'm proud of them. I really am. And I'm proud of, and that's the thing too, is that as weird as it is, and as strange as it is, that there's just a line through those years as if they did not happen.

Speaker 1:          00:33:13       Um, man, I had, I was paid to do a job, right. As messy as the job was, whatever. I was paid to do it. And I did it. Uh, and I wanted to win. I wanted to capture those memories for myself and for my teammates. And you can't, nobody can take those away from me. I still hold those memories to myself. And, um, yeah, it's, it's, it's had a complicated ending, but, um, you know, I still view those as victories and I still view those memories is good. The caring round, the lie, and being interrogated and questioned. And it was that the hardest part about all of it, you know, I was, I was only interrogated are questioned with the press and, and even, um, you know, God, if it would have been in this day and age with, with, with twitter and facebook and social media and, uh, it would, it would have been a thousand times worse.

Speaker 1:          00:34:06       I mean, this was, you know, I mean, this was in the late nineties. I mean, think about that. That was a long time ago. And so the level of scrutiny while it was high wasn't nearly as high as it would have been today. Um, but yeah, I mean, once you dig in, you know, with these, with these guys, you're, you're stuck. So once you finally came clean, I mean, obviously there was a lot of blow back, but was there also a relief? Um, not, not immediately. Not immediately. I mean, I, I, uh, I get asked that a lot and I think people, um, people, people expect me to say, well, you know, it was just this, it was just this huge relief off your shoulders when you, when you talked to oprah or you or whatever you did that, that you can now move forward and live the life of an honest man and et Cetera, et cetera.

Speaker 1:          00:34:58       But it's taken me, let me just sum it up. I mean, sitting here today, having this conversation, I would much prefer to have this conversation then the one where I would align to your fucking face 15 times, 10 years ago, I'd much rather us talk like this. So that's, that's a relief. Um, but it, but it was, you know, it's not like I walked out of sitting with Oprah and was like, oh my God, I feel amazing. That was, that was an ass weapon. And, uh, so was it like sitting there with Oprah? She's asking, she's drilling you, ask you questions about that start. She came out, she came out hot, yes or no. Yes or no. The one, yes or no.

Speaker 2:          00:35:38       That's it. I thought she did a good job. She did a great job. I thought she did a good job. I thought it was very compelling because the way she structured the beginning part of the conversation. Yeah. Especially if you're going to do something like that on television. You want to capture people and keep them there. You kind of have to approach it that way.

Speaker 1:          00:35:54       I thought she did a good job. I, I don't, I know that it wasn't well received and I, and I lean in what way? You mean people didn't like you afterwards and that way he wasn't low risk. I think there's two things. Number one, I, I wasn't emotionally ready to do that interview. I wasn't, uh, I wasn't in a place where I think that I sit today where it's, it is a position of contrition and understanding the tremendous sense of betrayal that's out there. Like my perception of that today is much sharper than it was three years ago when I sat with her. The feds and other lawsuits forced my hand. I had to sit there with that cause I knew I was going to be sitting with her or with you or with Tom Brokaw hall or I was going to be sitting with a government lawyer being deposed, being videoed and being leaked.

Speaker 1:          00:36:46       So I said, well, I'm going to go, I'm going to find the place that I'd rather sit down and talk about this as opposed to a grainy video that the government leaks to the world and that's your coming out party. So I did that. But the, the thing about Oprah is, is aside from me just not being ready at the time to do it, you know, people sensed that. But most importantly for the diehard cycling fans and sports fans, I didn't say enough. You didn't name names. He didn't, you didn't call anybody out. [inaudible] wasn't detailed enough. You're holding back. You're protecting people. That's what they said. That's a very small percentage of the population for the majority of the population. Those first five minutes was way too much information. They were like, what the fuck did I just hear? Like blood bags hipo testosterone transfusions, cheating. It was way too much. So you had people that were at one camp, a smaller camp said he didn't say it. Now he's holding back here, the other campus like, all right, that's, that's more than I needed to hear. And so everybody was pissed.

Speaker 2:          00:37:52       Well, I don't know why they would think it's too much. I mean, I don't know. I don't understand that logic because it is reality or grandma

Speaker 1:          00:37:59       duluth. Right. And, and you and you supported the cancer. So

Speaker 2:          00:38:02       survivor clause isn't real and you hear that. I mean, you're sitting there going, ah, I don't, I don't like anything about this. So the, uh, so I see, because they were also supporting lives, drawing, yeah. Also supporting the stores. How much of an effect did it have like almost immediately on your foundation? I don't know, because I was asked to leave the foundation before that and said, and I haven't been back, so I don't know. And I'm not, and I don't ask, is it still around? Yeah. Yeah. But it must've taken a devastating,

Speaker 1:          00:38:36       right? I think so. I mean it takes a hit in terms of, uh, obviously in terms of fundraising, which directly leads to its, you know, its effectiveness in terms of helping create change for cancer survivors are all around the world. You need to raise money in order to do that. Um, staff layoffs. Uh, I mean, you name it. I mean it, it's uh, but, but I don't, I don't have specifics because once I left the board and left the organization and they legally changed the name, I mean,

Speaker 2:          00:39:08       I dunno, it, none of it was shocking to me. Um, I mean, I knew, I didn't know, but I knew that every, I have a friend who was a professional cycler, just say his name is John Cyclist. Cyclist. Sorry. We're going to get this right. Let me see. Okay. People, I'm going to write it down. Cyclist. Yeah. He's up by, some people say the ultimate fighting challenge. It's championship. Um, and see, I would say that. Yeah, but challenge. Okay. It's okay. My friend John was a professional cyclist. Yup. And, uh, this was, uh, 2000, maybe three, three, four. And, um, he told me, he was like, listen man, we were all, we're all on it. He goes, guys would get off the bus in the middle of the night. You'd hear them taking off their bikes and going for a ride because their blood got too thick.

Speaker 1:          00:39:58       There are those old stories. Yeah, that's from EPL, right? It, that's a, yeah, I've heard those stories. I never, I never saw that, but well, so my friend John, I mean maybe it was on the crazy team or something like that. And back in the day before they got it dialed in. Well, what they, what happened was, is there was no test, right? So no sport had a test, whether it's cycling or swimming or running or boxing or who, whatever sport is using epo. They didn't have a test for EPO. And so they, uh, and with, you know, one of the side effects of epo or, or you know, or increasing your red cell count is your blood. It's, it's literally a question of viscosity, right? So all your oil and your hotel royal. Yeah. Well, that's the only time you ever think of the word viscosity, right, is your motor oil.

Speaker 1:          00:40:42       But more red cells means thicker blood. Your blood is too thick. We know what happens. It's not, it isn't a good thing. And so the sport had to go to, they couldn't test for the science wasn't there yet. So they went to these sort of preventative screening methods, right? So then they started testing the viscosity or the thickness of people's bloods, otherwise known as hematocrit. Right? Um, and so that they would use that as a screen. Anybody above 50% hematocrit couldn't race that you weren't positive, you didn't get banned, but you were put on the side for two weeks as a, as a health measure, anyone under 50% it was fine to race. So everybody took that is, I mean, before that there were people that were 60, 64%. Those guys might be getting up in the middle of the night going for a little spin, but at 50, you know, they deemed that sort of the healthiest level, you know, but people pushed it right up to 50.

Speaker 1:          00:41:35       Then there's, and there's some side effects and there's some possible potential health risks as far as like strokes and things along those lines. I'm sure. Did anybody that was on the tour ever dropped dead from epo? Well, there's, there, there was, you know, look, they're there. I don't know. I mean there are a lot of documented cases, especially in the 80s, right. When hipo I guess was first hitting the scene. There was this wave of Dutch cyclists that passed away in the night and you know, in the night, huh. In their sleep. And that's probably when it would happen. Well, I dunno, I mean, I, I, I didn't, I didn't do the autopsy, you know, nobody, I don't know if anybody's ever proven that, but that, that's sort of, um, I don't want to say that was the myth, but that was, uh, that Eco, the drug took the blame for those deaths.

Speaker 1:          00:42:25       And so it hasn't happened since and it didn't happen, uh, in, you know, in our generation. But I don't know. But my point being that it can be fairly dangerous. Well if, well if your blood, yeah, you can imagine if it gets to the SEC. So at that, that would not be one of the things that it didn't surprise me that, uh, when, when you came clean, I was like, well good for him. That was really what I thought. I was like, it's kind of fucked up that he was lying all this time and it's kind of fucked up that he was suing people that were saying that he was telling lies and, but one of the things that shocked me the most, well, I was thinking about it, was that you, you had recovered from cancer. You had one of your testicles removed. He had brain surgery, lung cancer.

Speaker 1:          00:43:14       You mean your, your body was ravaged by this and yet you still were taking drugs. Yup. That's, that's what got me, I was like that what a crazy desire to win that you, you got to this place where your body was, you know, you were on death's door and recover from it and then put yourself back and wrist. Right? Yup. I mean, yeah, saying it like that it, it, there's no, there's no justifying that other than you, I was in this sport that, that I really wanted to, to, to be in and stay in and after the disease I wanted to go back to, and that was the, that was the landscape. And so you viewed it, you thought, okay, this is not ideal, but you asked the question, what am I really, you know, having, knowing my health history, right, with cancer, with all the, all that I went through is going back to my sport and taking epo a risk to that, to that, you know, to my, to my disease or to my health.

Speaker 1:          00:44:19       Um, and I, and the answer to that, obviously my answer to myself was, no, you really didn't think that it was a risk to push your body like that. And, and to put all these, you mean stuff, they're there. They're in a lot of ways, they're pushing your body in an unnatural way or to an unnatural level. Testosterone and human growth hormone epo and all these and that. Sheila really, and that's the only difference that that was made was, I mean, I had a slight experience with growth hormone before the disease and then after, after the diagnosis and the treatment and recovery, I said, okay, that, that, that does not sound like a good idea. It's too dangerous. And perhaps in my own fucked up way, I was thinking, well, that would lead to the growth of a, have to have most of, you know, a malignant cell, et Cetera, et cetera.

Speaker 1:          00:45:13       So, um, but I didn't, I didn't view those two the simplest. I don't, I don't think hgh is for cycling. I don't think it's very effective anyways. I think it's a waste. Did you alter your diet? Well, for sure. Yeah. But what changes did you make when you, uh, when you came back from having cancer? Man, I was, and again, this is the stuff that we can talk about. I talked about forever and you know, and it's almost sort of mocked now. You know, cause we talked about the change in diet and the increased, you know, intensity of training and the reconnaissance and the technology and the wind tunnel. And we did all of those things and they all worked, you know. But I say their mock now because people now know the truth. We all know the truth. And people say, oh, he told us it was all that other bullshit.

Speaker 1:          00:45:56       He told us it was the training. He told us it was his diet. Well now we know it was just the doping. Um, well it wasn't though. There's the doping end. That was the last, that was the final piece, which just was unfortunately isn't it? Was it, as we've said numerous times, it's just an, it was unfortunate and it was inevitable. Um, but that was the final piece and the, and it was also the piece that we never talked about. Of course, of course. Yeah. So this is the weight you're carrying around. I, I'm what I'm asking you about your die. I literally didn't know that you had discussed this ad nauseum. Yeah. So you're, you're carrying this around. You're always assuming that if you look at me racing in [inaudible] 96 before I was diagnosed, and then you look at me winning the tour [inaudible] 99, I missed 20 pounds difference.

Speaker 1:          00:46:39       So I mean, I went and I had this when I got out of, uh, sort of my cancer mission, you know, and, and, and recovered and took a year and a half away and went back. I view, I mean, I viewed racing bikes as life, life and death. I viewed it, I viewed my disease as a, as a competitive event, as a sporting event. It's me versus the opposition, looking at the scoreboard, how we doing. And then when I got to, uh, when I got back on the bike, it was, it was, it was like life and death and so everything was intensified. Starving yourself, training your ass off, just being, as you said a minute ago, just being generally fucking totally crazy for, for a result. Mad, not mad, but madness. You were starving yourself to be lighter. Yeah. Well that's part of it. I mean these

Speaker 2:          00:47:30       poor guys down and there, there are a lot skinnier than we were. I mean this has guys ride in five, six hours a day and not eating. I mean it just, it just fucking sucks. How do they do it? You don't eat this? Just, just, just deal with it. Just go to bed hungry. Wow. Just to keep your body weight light. It's all power to weight. Wish she were still, I wish I would like to know what the fuck these guys are doing now. I would like to know when you see guys with faster times and really ridiculously stringent drug testing.

Speaker 1:          00:48:00       Yeah. Well anytime I go anywhere near that I just get, I just get destroyed because um, I don't know. The, the, the people view it as, as me accusing them. I mean I've, I've made, cause I get a lot, a lot of questions. Fall tweet backs. I don't ask me, I have no idea. You know, people take that as saying, well, he just, he just blamed them. He just accused them of doing the same shit. And I feel bad for those guys. Man. I feel I feel bad for any top level rider that that is racing their bike in 2015 and has to answer questions about a guy from 1999 like if I was winning in [inaudible] 99 and what is that 16 years? If somebody asks me a question about somebody from 1983 I said, what the fuck are you talking about? Don't ask me that question. Like why are you asking me? Well some do 20 years ago. I'm here today. So, but it's

Speaker 2:          00:48:48       well that's the craziest thing about you and the sport. You are inexorably tied to it. There's no way to pull it away from you. Like that scandal was one of the, at least in the United States, it was one of the biggest aspects of that sport ever. It's still, I mean it any, any, any story that gets written. I mean saw, I don't if you fall of track and field or all of this stuff that came out of Ben Johnson, too old, but there's, there was just this revelation that came out of international track and field and the Russian Federation and the covers up there and all of those stories that get written, whether it's on deadspin or the New York Times or on twitter, they all reference the story as well, so you get put back, which is, I don't know if that's a good or a bad thing, but it just, it, it brings people back to that, you know, to my history.

Speaker 2:          00:49:36       Yeah. It's like it's baseball and Barry bonds and it's just, there are tied, there's just no way they're going to, you're going to separate the two of them together. Yeah. It's, it's, it's got to be a very bizarre thing for those people that are racing. Hmm. That's them. Yeah. You should, don't want, they don't want to, so he knows who they are. That's the most fucked up thing about it. It's like you're like, I mean in a way like Tony Hawk is the only skateboarder I have ever heard of. It's the only, I mean I'm sure I've met a few other ones, but I don't know. I don't remember their names. Yeah, but Tony Hawk is that guy like you think a skateboarding thing? Could Tony Hobbit, you think of bike racing? I think of Lance Armstrong and now that you think of swimming, you think of Michael Phelps? Yeah. It's just, yeah, there's a few, well, Greg Lamont is a diver. You think of him, I guess he's kind of a swimmer. These buttons on this. Greg, Greg Gain Louganis sorry, I'm going to pay attention. At least you said cyclist. I did. I'm getting better. Greg. Greg Lamont's probably like what the fuck? Yeah, there's just, it's weird when you have a sport that's where the public locks onto one person and they don't know any of the other people. And like if it's football, there's like fucking hundreds of guys boxing hundreds of guys. But with cycling there's just so few and you carrying the weight of that sport in the United States. Trying to popularize it and as well as a holding onto this lie. Yep.

Speaker 1:          00:51:08       Yup. Yeah. Dope. Yeah. I mean, I mean that when I hear you say that, I mean it, it, it, it, and you may not be defending me, but it sounds as if you're defending me. So I don't, I don't necessarily want, yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:51:20       That I'm not defending you. Right. What I'm doing and I'm trying to aluminate reality in a pretty objective way. Well, you could do that on your next podcast because me sitting here right now each uncomfortable, no, it doesn't make me uncomfortable, but I,

Speaker 1:          00:51:33       I'm, I'm of the belief that nobody wants to hear that shit. That there's still, I think people are upset. I know they're upset. So

Speaker 2:          00:51:42       some people do. I mean, look, did you get, you gotta have people that are upset? Well, I think what we're dealing with when it comes to the Internet is just a gigantic number of people. There's too many people to like say, some people aren't this, but he can't, he can't manage it. There's hundreds of millions of people who can get on their facebook or get on the twitter and just start giving their input right now. And that's never happened before. And when that happens, you're going to be understandably sensitive to the outcome. Yup. Yeah. Yeah. What was the blow back like? Like when you, when you did the oprah thing and then you just went out into the public, did you just try to lay low for awhile?

Speaker 1:          00:52:18       Yeah, I tried to, well, there was, there was several variations of quote unquote blowback or there was just the public's perception. So if I walked down the street, which I have to admit was, was better than I expected. Right? Peep nobody. It's not as if I left talking with Oprah and I walked out on the street and you know, people were throwing shit at me. I mean, that just, that's never happened. Could happen one day, but it hasn't yet. There's the blow back, which is the most important part, which is the way my kids were treated. You know, I've got five kids, three older ones. Um, you know, I was very concerned with what they heard in the hallways, you know, what they, what they saw and their social media stuff. Um, you know, what, what is, what does that news due to them that is the most important thing.

Speaker 1:          00:53:04       And it's a real credit to the city of Austin and the schools that they go to our community and their friends and the kids in the school very little blow back. So that was, for me, that was, that was like the biggest relief. Like people can throw shit at me and say shit all day long, but if my kids were treated roughly, I mean, that would just, that would break your heart when it, I mean devastating. Yeah, that'd be the, by far the worst. So that was, um, that was very fortunate that, that there was not seamless. I mean, there was some stuff, but they managed it and we managed it in the community, managed it pretty well. And then there was the legal blow back, which was, uh, which was pretty nasty. I mean, I, I got there as soon as I stepped off the stage with Oprah, call it a stage, um, the lawsuit just piled up and piled up big.

Speaker 2:          00:53:52       And how many of them are still ongoing right now? Just one, just one. One the federal government when the federal case and the federal [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          00:53:58       they were, but there were, and some of them were, were, were highly publicized. Uh, and some were not some, the problem, the team was, uh, insuring all of my salaries and all of my bonuses unbeknownst to me. And so because they didn't have the money. And so when this goes down, all of these companies came back and said, where's our money? And I said, well, who are you? I said, well, we're so the team, I knew about one situation, right? The big one, the SCA case, which, uh, which has been settled since, but there were many, many others and some were public, some were private. Um, but they all had to get settled. And so we've navigated that landscape and now we're just down to the postal case, the federal case. And when is that going to be resolved? Um, that's a good question. It's been going on a long time. Uh, and it came on the heels of a two or three year criminal investigation, which you're well aware of through there, Jeff Novitsky and through the US Attorney's office here in Los Angeles. So once that case was closed, then the civil division picked up the postal case. And it's been ongoing for years. And, and

Speaker 2:          00:55:06       you know, we sort of finished that first phase of litigation and that it'll go to trial maybe a year from now in Washington DC. We talked about this very briefly before the podcast. We wanted to kind of save it for the podcast. I don't understand the criminal investigation. I don't understand the allocation of resources towards someone who was bike racing. I feel like in a world where we have bankers that causes gigantic 2008 financial collapse, we have pharmaceutical companies are making billions of dollars. Getting people hooked on Oxycontin is when we have crime and murder and all the fucking problems we have in this culture to spend taxpayers' dollars on bike racing. A guy who may have cheated or definitely cheated in a sport where everybody's cheating. Yup. That seems kind of fun.

Speaker 1:          00:55:55       Well, you can, it's mccarthyism. I mean, you can have, uh, first of all, cyclists don't have any lobbyists. Nobody's out protecting us. W W W whatever we did or didn't do in Europe 20 years ago, the banks do, big Pharma does, et Cetera, et cetera. So that's kind of a good old boys club that, that we're not a part of. But, and, and we've talked about this offline. I mean, when you, when you have a federal agent in a guy like Novitsky whose, whose, he has made his career with these types of cases, whether it's balco or bonds or Marion Jones, um, uh, when you have a guy like that, that, that all of a sudden is interested, it's gonna happen. You know? And, and when you have that, you know, particular agent or any agent that walks into a interview, a witness or interview, an old teammate with a badge and a gun, they're talking, yeah, it gets weird, right?

Speaker 1:          00:56:50       Yeah. They don't just kind of investigation. Yeah. It's so of course you, I mean, I know, I heard what you said. Of course. I don't think it makes much sense, but I'm, I was at, I was in the cross hairs. So people are going to say, well, of course you don't think it makes sense, but, um, look, I mean, uh, and I, and I listened to your, to your podcast with Novitsky and, uh, I mean it's just, uh, there's some bullshit in there. And so what specifically, um, you know, I think the idea that, that, uh, and I, and again, I'm not, I don't work for the government. I don't work for the US Attorney's office here, but I think the idea that he was brought into the investigation, I don't know that that's necessarily true. I think, um, I think, and again, I don't know Jeff, but I think he went, I think he looked for those cases.

Speaker 1:          00:57:45       I mean, he, and whether or not, and by the way, when you're an agent for the food and Drug Administration, I don't know how, I mean, all of these things have missions. He was, you know, he was an agent for the irs. And so then that's when balco and bond started. I don't, I dunno, the doping and baseball as an irs issue. I Dunno that doping in cycling 20 years ago is an issue for the FDA. I mean, they regulate who makes aspirin and who gives you your lettuce and your eggs and what does that have to do with, but I think he, I think he was opportunistic when it came to, uh, these cases, whether it's barry bonds or myself. Um, and, and, and you know, he, he thrived on that.

Speaker 2:          00:58:24       Well, I think you look at it two ways in one on one hand, he certainly capitalizes on these high profile cases. He certainly goes after that. I'm on the other hand, him capitalizing and being the, the rabbit investigator that he is, it highlights the issues that are going on. Sure. So the, I think the real problems, the allocation of money, like how much money is being spent on these cases. You know, he told me that the barry bonds case, they only spent like $100,000. I didn't, I didn't expect that. I didn't question them and I didn't research it beforehand. I didn't, I didn't know that that was even going to come up. But then once I did research it, it seems like it was a a fuck load. More money than $100,000.

Speaker 1:          00:59:08       Yeah. Well that's, that's obviously that's laughable, but, uh, whatever the number was, it, it, it, you know, it wasn't a hundred thousand, but it was, it was probably not as much as what was reported. Um, but

Speaker 2:          00:59:22       hey, that's a, that's the United States of America. That's what they get to do. And also you get a guy like him, and that's how these issues get highlighted. And that's why we know about it because he was so aggressive in his tactics. He was so aggressive and chasing down anybody that he thought was doing these drugs. That's why we know about these cases. And it's such an extreme detail. Yup. Yeah, yeah. Man, it was, it was, it was, it was, uh, it wasn't pleasant watching that are listening to that podcast. I mean, and the fact that the, I don't know if you're bullshitting me or not, the fact that he wanted to do the podcast with me. Oh he did? Yeah. He asked to do it. Well, what kind of crazy is that? Well, I think he wanted to find out like how do we felt about it, what it feels like now.

Speaker 2:          01:00:11       You know, he wants to, I mean it, it needs ongoing. I mean, he works right now doing drug investigations for the UFC and he's done a fantastic job to the point where, as I was telling you before the podcast, we've seen radical changes in fighters physiques and their performances. Guys like guys who were world beaters have dropped off substantially. There's the word in the mixed martial arts community. When I talked to fighters, when I talked to trainers, he's had a gigantic impact and they're terrified because they've imposed these very strict, uh, fines and a probationary periods. Yep. And as you also said before the podcast, I mean, you have a sport where, you know, the bigger and stronger your physically, the more you're pummeling somebody else's head in. Yes. It's different. It's different. Yeah. It's different than his stall. It is definitely different. I think it's much more, it's much more important.

Speaker 2:          01:01:03       Is this sport just as exciting? It's pretty damn exciting. So it's hard to say if it's just as exciting or not. Cause I think there's a lot of great fighters who were world champions who are clean cut. It's just a, it's like some of the all time greats. I mean, there's great guys right now, Frankie Edgar clean as a whistle. Chris Weidman, very clean, rockhold clean, who's the new champion in the middleweight division. There's a lot of great fighters that are clean. It's a, um, it's hard to tell. There's a lot of fighters who weren't clean, who are fucking awesome when they weren't clean. Vito Belfort, who, uh, went on this wild run for like a, at 36 years old when he a w they had, this is one of the apartments. One of the big problems with the UFC was that they had legal testosterone replacement for a short period of time for a few years and guys were just fucking juice into the tits.

Speaker 2:          01:01:54       They didn't like it was skittles. Oh, they would come back with these hyper human level so that they would test them and you know, like a normal person in your testosterone level would be like a low three, high eight, 800. Vito was like 1,475 and he looked like a fucking silver back and just hyper aggressive, super confident. That's different, you know, that's, that's dangerous. And winning and beating guys to, you know, to a pulp, right. That's a, that's a different situation. It's it, you know, you're not talking about an extreme endurance sport like that. Like that kind of aggression and explosion wouldn't benefit you in cycling because it's such a long endurance race. And also the, the benefit isn't the end result is in someone, someone's health doesn't get compromised by it. Yup. Yeah. So,

Speaker 1:          01:02:44       yeah. So I mean that's, I don't know that sport that well and, and I don't know what people's feelings are in and amongst the sport. I mean, you just give a pretty good perspective on it. So, uh, more power to him there.

Speaker 2:          01:02:56       It's just, it's messy to pull it out. It's messy because it was so pervasive. It's like if they had figured out it's if, if the tour, if half the guys were clean and half the guys were dirty, the Tour de France, and then they figured out how to pull the drugs out from half, it would be messy. Right, because then it'd be like, okay, well why? What happened? Why were these guys doing so well and now they're not the guys who are winning or not winning, but if they, the tour seems like it's so pervasive that if they pull the drugs out, the same guys would be winning the times. It'd be slower

Speaker 1:          01:03:32       but, but what happened? What happened was primarily I guess the Dude Novitsky his investigation, which which when was closed, he more or less handed everything to you saw it, you saw the picked up the investigation and then they acted. They gave me the lifetime ban that left, like when the world reads that in 2012, it was the summer of 2012 the world reads that the impression is, or when I do oprah, for example, which has three or four months later, the impression is that we were hanging a blood bag six months ago. Like it's a current event. It feels, although it had been, it had been seven years before any line had ever been crossed ever, even during the compact. So, but it made it current. The comeback made it current for people. Novitsky investigating, uh, getting everybody to speak through his own tactics. Um, it made it a current event when it, when it really, it really wasn't.

Speaker 1:          01:04:29       It's like, it's like, uh, I remember sitting there in 2012 thinking, or the shit's going down. This is, this is unbelievable. Being in the middle of it being me, this is unreal. And I thought, you know, and, and we're talking about 1999 through 2005, but let's use 99 as, as an example. I remember thinking to myself, who won the superbowl in [inaudible] 99 and it was the, the broncos and elway was the MVP. I remember thinking to myself, what if I open the paper today and the NFL is opened a case against John La in 2012. I would have read that and gone, this is a joke, right? He said, April fools. Like what the fuck? It isn't like an old guy who stands on the sideline now. Like, so it just, they were able to go way, way back and, and, and sidestep and ignore any sort of due process and statute of limitations and they made it a current event. I'm not, I'm not blaming them or defending myself. I'm just telling you what happened. And uh, you know, that, you know, is not totally accurate, but

Speaker 2:          01:05:31       well, it's because it was so long. It went on for so long. Like you remember they had that Nike commercial when that Nike Commercial, when you were doing it live strong Nike, Nike commercial and you're, you're riding your bike and you're talking about people calling you a doper. This is before you had come clean. That was in 2000 yeah. And this is, this is before, you'd never failed any tests. There was not, but you still had to address it in a fucking Nike commercial. Yeah. So this was, this was something that was, it was ill advised. Yeah, it seems, but that's again, I mean all of this, whether it's

Speaker 1:          01:06:05       agreeing to that commercial or the way you treated, I needed, you know, somebody in my life to go, I, I, I just read this script or this storyboard and I think that's a real bad idea. But did you have anybody like that in your life? Well, clearly not, but did anybody suggest it? No. No one but no. But, but I was,

Speaker 2:          01:06:27       but isn't that hard though, because you're such a fucking winner. You're lucky you're on top of that world. Nobody wants to say, hey man, don't do that

Speaker 1:          01:06:33       dude. It's like when you're, when you're in that position, nobody, everybody's saying yes, yes, yes, of course. Yes. That's a great idea. Yes. Lance. Yes, absolutely. Right now, yes. It. Then nobody's sitting there playing the devil's advocate or saying, I think that's a bad idea. There's, I didn't have that north star man and, and again, I'm not, the fucking buck stops with me, man. I should have been mature enough and worldly enough to go

Speaker 2:          01:07:01       bad idea. Let's make another commercial are bad idea. Lance. Let's say something else in the next press conference. But it seems like the, the weight of it all in the air of it all was so thick that you kind of had to address it all the time because it was being thrown at you all the time. I was, I peripherally watched cycling peripherally and I knew about it. Everyone knew about it right on

Speaker 1:          01:07:21       it, but, but it, but the more defensive I became and the more aggressive I became in the denials, all that does, right, is what it might a piece. Some people are support is good lad. Did you, I heard it in his voice. I believe that. But what it really did, especially with the press was it just, it just made the next occasion, the next question, the next episode even more inevitable. Like it just, it added fuel to that fire. Like you know, looking back in hindsight, I should've just said like, I'm not going not gonna talk about it or whatever the answer was. But instead of saying, you know, it was literally like finger in your chest, fuck you don't ask me that. I mean that is when you're guilty. That's a real bad approach and it's the one that I took and quite honestly it's, you know, probably one of the main reasons that, that we're sitting here today talking about this.

Speaker 1:          01:08:20       Why do you think you took that approach when looking back on it? Because I, because that is the approach that I took and training and in racing and even, I mean these are guys that I raced against that I liked, but I would make up reasons to fucking hate him. Like I'd read something and be like, look at this asshole. Did you read what he's, I mean he probably didn't even say anything. I'd take it. I'd be like, I can't believe he said just as fuel. Just his motivation. So that's all fine and good when you're training and your racing. And you're competing, but when you step off the bike that you have to have that switch to say, okay, that's been done. You won the written, don't, we're not going to go treat another human being that way. Right. And, and just uh, in a professional context or in a press context, you gotta turn it off, man. And I couldn't, like I was, I had my finger in people's chest on the bike, off the bike everywhere. And so my bad dude, I mean, I, I didn't have the, the ability to turn that off. I mean, it's good to be a competitor, but it's not good to be too competitive.

Speaker 2:          01:09:22       And once you start, once you took that approach, once you started with that approach, did you feel like there was like a weight of momentum behind you? Like to dig your heels in and stop it and try a new approach would be very difficult.

Speaker 1:          01:09:35       Well, yeah, once, once it gets rolling, it's, it's tough to ducted. Halter,

Speaker 2:          01:09:41       what was it like with the people that you were close to? Obviously the people that you trained with, they knew what you were doing, but what about your family and your close friends? How many of them were aware of what was going on?

Speaker 1:          01:09:52       I think by and large, I don't know. I wouldn't have asked him and they wouldn't have asked me. I think it was sort of this to your friends. Never add any land, man. Come on. I think it's more donate ever pulled you aside? Don't ask. Don't tell. Really. Yeah, probably. You know they probably didn't. They didn't want to know. Do you have close friends outside of cycling? Yes. And they didn't ask you? Yeah. Well no they didn't, but really, I mean they might also ride bikes so they're not in the sport, but, but yeah, nobody sat at the bar. I was like, dude, come on. Yeah,

Speaker 2:          01:10:26       no one. No. Wow. That's fucking crazy. If I was your friend, dude, I would've got you fucked up. I was just going to say, you got you drunk. I'm like, come on dude, we're going on a hike. You're Joe Joe, Joe. We'd be talking about it now. He's like, I would have, I remember that time I got him all fucked up and he admitted it. I would've never said a word until you came out. Once he came out, then I woulda told until the guy with the badge and the gun showed up and then you would have said everything. I would have ducked Jeff Novitsky. Yeah. No, I would have hired some lawyers. I believe. You got to sit with me when this guy comes in. What's going on? What do you want to know? Nobody bike racing mocked it. Nobody bike. Bike racing like a kid's bike and what?

Speaker 2:          01:11:05       You have a gun? Someone stealing bikes? No, they're the killing people with bikes. The fuck's going on with that gun? Yeah. What happens in these podcasts when, when? When the interviewee has to take a leak. You go take a leak, man. Don't worry. What happens to the podcast? We'll just pause it for a second. What about the people at home? I'll talk to them. Don't worry about, oh yeah, that's right. You're also here too. Don't worry about it, man. Go take a leak. Happens all the time. It's no big deal. Really? Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. All the time. Don't sweat. Well, I'm going to go take it. Go take a leak. Please do. Just one thing about athletes, they drink. Fuck loads of water lenses here pounding. He's hung over to, here's a very specific schedule. He told me he drinks two cups of coffee in the morning. Then it takes a shit and he drinks water all day and then he waits until about five, about five. Then he started drinking.

Speaker 2:          01:11:50       That's a good drug. I was going to ask him about marijuana cause if he smoked marijuana and he was holding in all those lies, that shit would fuck with you. Like I'll smoke some weed and uh, I'll think about a lie. I told them highschool, I don't fuck with me really well. I'll think about some shit that I did in high school and make me go, oh, why the fuck did I say that? Like it net. That's the one of the crazy things about marijuana and never lets you forget. It'll bring those things up to you trying to hide. But alcohol. Alcohol is like, Eh, don't worry about it. Buzzy alcohol is the best drug. If you're trying to hold back a lie, just throw that down. And you know, as soon as you can't walk straight, you're thinking about that. As soon as you're, you know, you're, you're thinking about the song was playing, you're thinking about your whatever you're thinking about other things.

Speaker 2:          01:12:41       It's good. It's a good close your focus drug. Whereas pot is the opposite. Pot is a open your focus. This is fascinating though, isn't a Jamie forget you have a secret. Yeah. You forget. You don't give a fuck about your secrets. I mean, that's why people make horrible sexual decisions when they're drunk. You know? I mean, it's also why people think that people that are drunk shouldn't, you shouldn't have sex with someone who's drunk, even if you're drunk. I mean, that's why they're the crazy feminist tried to say that that's rape and ended up man and woman have sex in there drunk. It's rape while they say it. Because you're obviously not exactly of sound. I mean it depends on how drunk you are, right? But at a certain level, you're certainly impaired and you can't make good decisions. It's like, it's funny though, that a guy who was just such a, an athlete, lifelong athlete, fucking pounds, UCC like that.

Speaker 2:          01:13:31       And ask him how long does it, we were talking about marijuana and whether or not, uh, you used marijuana while you were a holding back all those lies and how it would fuck with you. Because when I was, I'll think I'll get high and I'll think about some shit I lied about in high school and it will go like, oh, paranoia. And it'll illuminate areas of your life that you're trying to, uh, avoid. Hmm. Hmm. The economy of all this is a fascinating aspect of it because there were a lot of people that were making money off of you racing a lot of people. There's a gigantic industry. And for them to pretend that they didn't know what I knew as a fucking comedian who w again, peripherally watch cycling, you know, I'd watch you win and I be like, damn, that motherfucker want again.

Speaker 2:          01:14:25       Damn. That's it. You know, I mean, I'd, I'd never raced raced bikes. I never rode bikes is so for me and I knew, you know, I'm like, how the fuck does the US post office not know? How the fuck does Nike not know how the fuck does they know? They know. They know. They can pretend they don't know, but they know if they didn't, if they didn't know then they're irresponsible. It's irresponsible. But they kind of knew and they just said, it's all right. We're getting away with it. We are getting away with it. But then once the shit came down, then they all wanted their money back. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:15:01       Well

Speaker 2:          01:15:04       that's a weird aspect. You can't talk too much about this, right? That one. Yeah. I wouldn't get sensitive for the post office one. Tricky. Definitely toughest one. I know you can't talk about it, but can you talk about this is this is a reality when you are accused of defrauding the federal government, which is what they're saying because you were riding for the US post office, that was the team and you won x amount of money during that time. They, they can sue you for three times that money. Correct. Right. So they want a hundred million bucks. Yeah. A lot of money. How's that going?

Speaker 1:          01:15:44       That's uh, you know, honestly it didn't, that's it. That's the only active case. So that one does get a little trickier to talk about just from a, uh, uh, I don't want to be crushed by my lawyers, but we like our case. W W we think that, uh, we're, we're confident in the case. We believe that the postal service a while none of this story is, is, uh, is perfect. Um, we believe that the postal service and the, and their own numbers support it. I mean the Postal Service Commission three separate studies to, to analyze the effect of the sponsorship on the team. Uh, we believe they made hundreds of millions of dollars and, and we know that they were also using the team as a sales vehicle. So coming to the two during the tour, bringing over potential new clients, bringing over new clients there were actually converting their business to the postal service. We know that happened and we know that equaled a significant increase in revenue. So we like our case, I mean, and, and, and at this point, uh, what I like to have all legal issues out of my life. Yes. But settlements not an option. And so we have to just fall back on what we think is the strength of the case.

Speaker 2:          01:17:00       Does that, if they made a ton of money while you were being dishonest, does that exonerate you from owing the money? Like how does that work?

Speaker 1:          01:17:10       Well, I'm not a lawyer, right? My view of, of of uh, it's called a key tm case, which is a false claims case. My view is, is, and I think is one that, that our side shares is it's about damages, right? When was the postal service damaged and what can we prove to be the damages? And uh, you know, if there are no damages, then I would like to think then there was no case. But it's, it is what it is. The federal government is interested in. The Department of Justice is interested in the case. Uh, and we, and I have no choice but to fight it. Uh, I don't, I don't have, after the, you know, the dozen previous lawsuits, I'm not in a position to, to really cut any more checks. And so I'm in a position where I have to go, I have to go fight this one out.

Speaker 1:          01:18:01       How do you get by financially now? Um, well the, the first thing that, that I did was, was, and I, and I saw this coming into this, what's going to happen is your life was big. I mean, a three houses. We had a jet. I mean we had the whole, so you just take that burn rate way down. So you just, you're, your overhead goes way down. And you know, the, the crazy thing is, is if you'd have told me before, like, you're going to go sell a bunch of shit and so your plane, I'm like, dude, that is life is going to suck. Was that a plane? Just, you know, the house and it was, this is, I'm not trying, I'm not bragging, I'm just telling you what really happened. And, but I would've thought, man, this life is, it's going to be terrible.

Speaker 1:          01:18:47       As you take it down and you live a simpler life and you get your burn rate down and you get it manageable. Life's exactly the same. Like I don't know. I mean the happiness factor is exactly the same. None of that shit he's on that they've done studies on the none of that shit. It's more convenient. Right. Obviously getting going direct somewhere and not dealing with a terminal and, and you know, fucking Tsa, obviously that's different but it takes some more time, you know, around more people. But I'm just as happy as I was. Heel. They've done studies on people that actually complicate their lives with more success, more houses, more things in it actually makes you more tense. It gives you more to think about. Well you got to, yeah, I mean you got to keep, you know, you have to feed that beast and so you get a little bit of the dog Jason, the tail going on and um, you know, life life was moving real, real fast for me then.

Speaker 1:          01:19:42       And it moves a lot slower now. Um, which I don't, I don't, I don't, it might be a little slow for my taste right now, but I don't, I didn't like it when it was that fast. So you cut back on all the expenses and what do you do? You do earn money now? Like what do you do to earn money? You know, occasionally. So I'll, I'll, I'll, I still speak and sometimes, uh, I'm paid to speak. Um, and then they're just other, other appearances. I mean, I still have some investments that, that uh, you know, that help sort of ease that pain. Um, but you know, and who knows what the future holds. I don't know what, what if that stuff dries up forever or comes back or who knows?

Speaker 2:          01:20:23       What does it like to sit? While this was all going on and watching the economy of this story grow and develop because it's not, it wasn't just the, the lawsuits. There's also, there's books, there's documentaries is all these television shows is all its focus. There's ad revenue coming from those shows, is all these people that are dedicating all this time, like their careers become a big part of their careers, become telling the Lance Armstrong story. Yeah,

Speaker 1:          01:20:51       it's a, it's a, it's a, it's a small industry. Yeah. Um, I mean there, there was the industries that benefited on the way up and I was one of those industries. There were the sponsor. I mean, you look at trek bicycles for example. I mean before the first tour that I think we did 125 million in sales. I do a billion now. So yeah, it was big difference. Um, Eh, so you have those sort of industries, but then, you know, on the way down. So those are all people are making money on the way up and then on the way down, uh, yeah, it's, I think it's, it did happen, but it's probably normal and natural that people capitalize on, on the way down. I mean, look at Bill Clinton. I mean, as he's going through everything he went to, believe me, there were plenty of people going on right now. It's my turn to make some money and fair play. I mean that's just, that's just the way it is. And uh, you know, some people may think that's bs, but shit, I mean, everybody was hopping on, uh, all the way down.

Speaker 2:          01:21:43       Well, they have to write. Yeah. I mean it is a, it was a gigantic story. Now you're, your friends did know what you were doing when it came out. How many of them had a hard time with it? How many of them were cool with it? Like what was it like, you

Speaker 1:          01:21:59       know, it's, yeah, some, I mean obviously the people, you know, the, the sponsors fled, right? Did any of them stay? No. None. How many did you have at a time? Maybe 10. But they have to leave. Right? I mean, like some of them are publicly traded companies, so they have concerns about that. Some of them are just covering their ass, whatever, but they're all gone. Um, and friends are interesting. I mean you have, uh, I mean, just use the [inaudible] foundation is as an example, right? I mean, the, the, I was on the board, I was the chairman of the board, I was the founder. The board was my friends. But these are the friends that say, okay, you're out. And so I get it that, that there might be a strategic reason for that, but then when you never hear from them, then all of a sudden these people disappear from your life.

Speaker 1:          01:22:46       I mean, the way I sum it up is, is anytime anybody goes through anything, and I don't know if you've had some heavy shit in your life, but when you're going through it, people either lean in or they lean out and some people lean out, which means they run away. And you're surprised by that and you're like, what the fuck? I mean, that guy was at every champagne party we threw in Paris. And right now he's like, I've heard from the dude in three years. Like, that's strange. Right? Um, but he probably has his own motivate, either covering his own ass or maybe he one of these people that has a tremendous sense of betrayal and it's just so pissed still and hurt. And we have to, I mean, I have to be receptive to that. Um, but then they're the ones who lean in, right?

Speaker 1:          01:23:25       And, and most of those people don't surprise you, but then there are others that lean in and they surprise. You're like, wow, I didn't, I didn't know you had my back like that. And so you get surprised on both sides and, and at the end of it all, dude, you look around and you're like, all right, this, this, if these people are here to these, these are the people that are going to ride anything out with me, which is Kinda cool and refreshing for me to, to, to really know, right? If you're, if you're, if you're in the, if you're loading up a bus with all your most loyal, closest friends, I fucking know who's on that bus now at this point. And for 20 years, you know, there was just a bunch of chumps that, that, that, that were on that bus. But you know, as soon as, as soon as the, the, somebody changed the music, they hopped off. And so, um,

Speaker 2:          01:24:16       and would tell you it takes adversity to eliminate that no other way in until you test them. You really don't know.

Speaker 1:          01:24:22       Yeah. Adversity. I remember, this is the funny quote, we were, this is a postal thing, but we were, once I was at, I don't remember the postmaster general's name, his name at the time, but we, we did, uh, this totally unrelated, but you said it versus saw it reminded me he was introducing me at this thing and he wanted to site, you know, introducing me. He's overcome great adversity. He says is lance, he's, he's overcome great diversity.

Speaker 2:          01:24:50       And I'm thinking, Jesus White Kid from Plano, I didn't overcome shit. Whoops. Um, raising kids. Yup. Uh, we both have children. And obviously when you were raising your kid, you're teaching them about life, you're trying to set an example. Yep. Um, did you have to sit them down and explain what was going on?

Speaker 1:          01:25:20       Um, how old were your youngest at the time? Oh, and t, uh, the youngest we're wanting to, whoa. Yeah. You didn't have to explain it. So I've got, I have three kids with my ex wife, Kristen and Lucas, now 16 and twin girls that are 14. And then I have a six and a five year old with Ana. I'm bitten, by the way. All you know, it's the craziest blended family you've ever seen. Like those five kids are five siblings. It's, it's the most beautiful thing. And Anna and kristen are like sisters. I mean, it's, I got a great situation. That's awesome. Awesome, awesome. It takes a lot of work, but um, or took a lot of work to get to this place, but it's awesome. And Kristen, to her credit was who I was married to during this ugly period. Um, and who, you know, would obviously would have known everything, um, has been great.

Speaker 1:          01:26:11       Whether it's, whether it's conversations she's had with our older children while were at her house, or just just helping massage this thing. But I'm still sitting down with my kids. I mean our whole, you know, I go to therapy and it goes, we all go to them, the kids go a week. So we still sit down and just kind of work this out. Dude, this is, is is not, this is a complicated thing. And, and, and the crazy thing is my older kids have kind of gotten through it. The six and the five year old will come into it, right? I mean the Internet and, and you know, fucking Google, wikipedia, you name it, they're going to, they will, they will grow into this like at some point, my six year old boy who said just a fanatical athlete and everything is sports and sports and sports.

Speaker 1:          01:26:53       I mean, I mean I hear his, him and his friends talk about Tom Brady and one of his friends like, oh, he's a cheater. My son loves Tom Brady. He's like, oh, he's a cheater. I'm like, it ain't going to be long before Max Armstrong is at school. And some kid in another class goes, isn't your dad that cheater? Like he's going to be like, what? Like he, he doesn't know that, but he, so he's going to grow into that. So that conversation will then be had at that time. It's tough to have it with a six year old today, but, so I know that's coming. Right. And so, but I have the experience of having dealt with it with a 16 year old boy who at the time was 13. Um, and, and still dealing with it with those guys. And you know, so far, I mean, I think we've been super proactive, probably, you know, Anna and Kristen probably think I should've been more proactive.

Speaker 1:          01:27:39       But, um, I think it's an, I think that's in a good spot. So you have group therapy sessions where you just discuss. So I've sat with, with all three kids, the older kids, you know, and it's just sort of free for all. Wow. Yeah. And they had no idea until the scandal broke. Yep. And what was their reaction? Um, you know, the girls were, they were nine, so they were still, they were young. I mean, a nine year old girl, they really didn't have a reaction. Luke was, was, uh, was, uh, a 13 year old boy. No. So they were 11, so luke was 13. They were 11. They still sort of immune to it, you know, he, he was, I mean he watched when he watched oprah because it airdrie or four days later I had sort of fled to Hawaii. I mean, he called me up cause I talked about luke on, on, on her show, um, with the whole idea that I know he's defending me at school.

Speaker 1:          01:28:37       I mean, there was enough smoke that people were going, Dude, you're dad's a doper, et cetera. And he was defending me and my point, Oprah was that at this point I get to say to Luke, stop defending me. You don't need to defend me anymore. Right. It's true. And so he watched that, which is probably a heavy moment for, for him. It would have been awful watching it with him. Um, but he called me and said, I understand and, and I love you. And, and uh, but we still, I mean, that was three years ago. We still have to talk about these things, man. It it

Speaker 2:          01:29:08       how often? Not, not often. No. It's still occasionally comes up, especially if you're talking about the importance of being honest and truthful and, and having character. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:29:20       And he's an athlete. I mean, look, I mean, not that, that's the only thing that I will, and I will say, I mean, I don't want a ideal, my son's huge, six, six, three, 230 pounds plays offensive line. Like,

Speaker 2:          01:29:34       well, that's good. That is not too many people would be fucking with him. Yeah. He's, he, I think he's good there, but he's also a real

Speaker 1:          01:29:40       sweet guy. Like he's not, he's not a, he's not an anybody's face. Um, but I don't want him to say his football passion or,

Speaker 2:          01:29:49       or career, what call it, what you will ends up, you know, at a high level. I mean, I don't want him in a messy spot where he's got to make tough choices. Right. In fact, I don't want that at all. And football is a sport where you have to make tough choices. I mean, I'm not a football player, but I can, yeah. I can imagine. I have friends that are, yeah. I can imagine. Yeah. That's mean. And it's also open and it's also brought up by coaches and it's also brought up by trainers. I mean, it's just a, it's a part of the game as much as I'm sure it is in cycling. Yeah. Yeah. That had to be just, it's just how to like be chewing you apart when you know that your kids defending you and you know it's going to come out. And you know, he's having these conversations at school and he's like, my dad's not a cheater. Yup.

Speaker 1:          01:30:40       Well, we didn't know it was going to come out. I mean, even, even when the Wicki was investigating, I mean that, that, that case went away. Right. So we thought at that point, maybe we're done and, and, and, and, and it didn't, I mean, you sought a picked up, uh, the investigation and then, uh, uh, you know, based on all his work, they picked it up and then it came up. But I can, it happened fast, like get, it was seemingly like instantaneous man. It be an enterprise. You, um, yeah, yeah. I think, I mean, I guess it's, yeah, it surprised me, but

Speaker 1:          01:31:22       shit, anybody would have been surprised I suppose. And it was just surreal, you know, the way, uh, it, it all came out and uh, and, and in the method at which they sort of advertised the findings, you know, it was, it was, and there was a whole strip, but to their credit, I mean, there was a strategy on their end. So let's, let's take Novitsky keys work, let's do some additional investigations, let's package it and what's something they called the reason decision and then let's go out and talk about it all over the place like that, that, that was kind of unbelievable to me.

Speaker 2:          01:31:58       Why do you think they spent so much time and resources going after you, uh, as opposed to all the other people who have one b?

Speaker 1:          01:32:06       Well, because they needed a landmark case that I think there's plenty of people that, that I'm just guessing I'm not, this is not based on any proof. And, and I've had conversations with, you saw it. I mean, I think we're still getting to the point where we can do stuff together or have a conversation. So I'm not trying to criticize them. I mean, I think there, there, there ought to be a place for them, but I think there's also realistic. I mean in reality there are, there are people that think they're ineffective. They think they spend 10 or 20 or 50 minute, whatever the number is, millions of dollars a year. And they don't catch anybody. Right? I mean if you look at the amount of positives is, must be less than 1%. Well, if I told you, well Joe, we're all good man is less than 1% testing positive, he would, you would right. You think that right? Yeah. So they needed, they needed a landmark case to say, no, we are effective. And here it is. Um, and I think also from a legal perspective at set some legal precedents for them that they can use going forward in other cases with future future cases.

Speaker 1:          01:33:15       But, uh, and then you add in a, just a ginormous story that was guaranteed to get a lot of press. But it still pains me to, to, to look, I know what went on. We all know what went on, but I can't take, uh, when, when I hear that, that this program or this particular athlete being me was the greatest fraud in the history of sport. You know, I can't, that's just not true. Right. And then when you hear that, are the, the, our teams doping program was the most sophisticated program in the history of sport. Well, we also know that's not true. Right? Um, so those are, and then, and then the final one was, which is really, I think bothered a lot of people that, that this person being me forced young, impressionable young men to put dangerous substances into their body. Right? That just is not true. And, uh, but if I heard somebody, if somebody said that about one of my son's friends, I would be pissed off too. Like I'd be like, dude, screw that guy. Right? But we all made our own choices. We were all grown men. They were bad choices, right? So most would say we would say, um, but, but there was no forcing to do that.

Speaker 2:          01:34:34       What is it like now? Like in a, I mean I want you to personal, but your personal life, like people value honesty. It's one of the most important things in friends and lovers when you have this thing where you're on video over and over and over and over and over and over again, being deceptive over and over again, defending when you, it's, and then you come out and say it's all a lot. And so there's this like database of lying, like what is it like, like trying to get people to trust you,

Speaker 1:          01:35:08       right? Hey man, that's [inaudible] this is what, this is what I talked about in the beginning is that that that road is, uh, is, is net that will be, that is a never ending path. I will be walking that walk the rest of my life and there were a lot of people that'll say, [inaudible], I'm never trusting this guy ever again. I don't care. I don't care how apologetic or tried he is, I'm done. Um, but that's, that's the, the key is that I have to be committed to that path. Right. And so I can walk that walk and, uh, and, and take each case individually and one on one. Um, but talk about in drumming, we've talked about endurance that will be the longest, the longest walk or the longest journey of my life.

Speaker 2:          01:35:56       Do you have a code that you follow now? I mean, have you imposed like, uh, a stringent set of rules on yourself where like, you know, like, because of this history, you can't lie about anything ever?

Speaker 1:          01:36:12       No, I mean, I haven't thought, I mean, I guess the answer's no because I haven't, there's not been a, you know, sort of a new mission statement or sort of these key, but, but I mean life was pretty transparent anyways before that. But I mean, there was obviously there was the huge deception. Um, but it's not as if, you know, anything crazy out there outside of that. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          01:36:41       But I mean, you know, um, it's just, that's a big thing with people to be able to trust our friends or you'll be able to trust their boyfriend or girlfriend, you know? Yup. For sure. What is life like for Lance Armstrong now? Like is a, is everything calmed down to the point where the stress has minimized except for the lawsuit?

Speaker 1:          01:37:03       Uh, yeah, it's, it's, as I said a sec a second ago, it's just simple, man. I, I mean, I, I still, I love to workout, so I train every day. I think that's what he'd do. I, uh, I primarily run and then I'll do a little bit of gym work and then, uh, I'll ride occasionally, although very rarely, very rarely get on a bike. Um, and I just, it takes too much time and it's just, I take so much time. I mean, you could run for an hour. Oh, I said, if you do a hard run for an hour, you got to go ride for three hours. So that's two more hours that you, unless you got to get all this shit on and go out and deal with traffic. And it does it psychologically fuck with you when you get on a bike. It's, it's, I mean, I have some bitterness there towards what we've talked about primarily in and around the economy of it, how it was.

Speaker 1:          01:37:54       And now everybody's, no, no, nope. We're out or we don't want, right. We're going to, you know, so that's, that's, but that's, that's on me. I got to work that out. And that's not, that's not their fault. That's my fault. So there's some of that and it's nice to do. I love to run on me. I grew up, I ran before I wrote, so it's, it's nice to go into something where I can still get, I mean, I view working out, you probably view it the same way. It's almost like a therapy. Like you're in there, you're suffering, you're just working shit out. Right. And that's what, that's what I do when I, um, when I work out or go for a long run. So I do that, uh, a joke. I mean we have, you know, I have five kids are in four different schools, so it's um, like an uber driver for my kids. But traffic in Austin is not like la, but it's bad. Now. This again bad now and so all I do is drive my kids around.

Speaker 2:          01:38:41       Too many people talk about how Great Austin is. That's what happened.

Speaker 1:          01:38:43       Right? Well the, but they didn't build that city 50 years ago to accommodate 2 million people. And then, uh, I played a lot. I play a lot of golf, which is why we're going to end this podcast will, that's why I can go play Riviera. They man, don't mess up my tee time.

Speaker 2:          01:38:58       I don't, I don't want to mess with you tea time. I appreciate your time very much.

Speaker 1:          01:39:01       But we've already done, we can keep going. Keep going. I Dunno if Higgs is here yet. He's, I'm sure he's here. Someone's calling me. That's on him. Um, and then you got the hunter book. We got to talk a little bit about hunter. Yeah, definitely. I didn't know you were a fan until I saw your, maybe bill burr retweeted. Maybe you're a tweet that said, if anybody, if there's one person that's dead that, that, you know, that I could meet today or was alive would be hunter.

Speaker 2:          01:39:29       Yeah. It was a instagram post that I made about one of his incredible quotes about, um, it was about heroes and it was, uh, it was particularly poignant about a, it was after Ronda Rousey got knocked out, but I posted it that people, they, they love the idea of someone who is like a superhuman person, like someone who's a legend, someone who, who can defy the odds because it gives them hope in this crazy world, boredom and cubicles. And I'm doing a shitty job of paraphrasing it, but it's a fantastic quote. And then you got a hold of me about it. And, uh, had that incredible book sent to me. What an a hunter was running for sheriff of Aspen. Yup. Yup.

Speaker 1:          01:40:12       Yup. So he, yeah, he, he just, you know, he kind of ruled the valley. I mean, he lived down in Woody Creek, but, but the whole, um, the whole valley was the roaring fork valley was kind of his domain and he was just in, his best friend was, was our longtime sheriff. He was the sheriff for 26 years. Bob Brown, who's a great friend of mine, uh, his under sheriff is probably my best bud there, a guy named by the name of Joe de Salvo. So how a kid from Brooklyn ends up in Aspen is now the sheriff is on a second term. So Joey and Bob were, were hunters best buddies. I mean, fucking crazy stories and I, and, and not to toot my own horn, but in bob has, is the sweetest. He was, he's the guy that was shared for 26 years. He says to me one day, he says, he calls me champ, which is also funny.

Speaker 1:          01:41:00       He says, Jampie says, uh, did you ever meet hunter? And I said, no, I never met him. And he pauses for a long time. And he goes, man, he would have loved you. I was, I took that. I was like, fucking, hey, that was a compliment right there. Hunter was, was, was nuts and, and a lot of ways, but I know, I mean, he had such a diverse group of friends, whether it's, whether it was our sheriff or whether it was lyle lovett or whether it was Johnny Depp or whether it was Doug Brinkley. I mean, just, just this diverse group of fucking artists and thinkers and lawmen and, and druggies and dude, gnarly. I mean, he'd go out to the shit they did was just, I probably can't even talk about it. I'm sure you can. He's dead. It's fine. There were some of the people are still alive, still alive when we were talking before the podcast about his ritual, uh, before you would, right.

Speaker 1:          01:41:49       So like, yeah, superhuman. So I you, so you read that and if for those listening or you just google, you know, a hunter Thompson's daily regime and you'll, it'll come up, I think esquire wrote it and the shit starts at like, what is, he wakes up at like three in the afternoon, right? And it just, you got to go read it. I mean it's, it's unbelievable. So I thought, this is so unreal. It ain't true. So I called Joey, our sheriff and I said, dude, I have you seen this? And he says, yeah, I said that, that's not real. You know what he said? He said, that isn't enough. He said, that's light. Can you believe, go read it people and then imagine that, that, that, that didn't quite get there. Well Jamie, why don't you find it? Cause it's, it's kind of hilarious. We could actually read it on the air dude.

Speaker 1:          01:42:35       Yeah. He, um, he had a strong tolerance for substances and he, I don't think he ever went without, I mean it's just he wasn't interested. No, no. Yeah. I mean that was, that was the life that he was interested in. He was interested in just getting fucked up and having a great time and, and writing about shit and pontificating on the demise of civilization. Yeah. But it, but you know, I don't know if that's what caught up to him, but it definitely did. I mean, how could you, did you ever see the late appearances? I, I have a really hard time watching his later appearances. Like we would do like the Conan O'brien show and you could understand a word he was saying. Like here, you can see it right here.

Speaker 3:          01:43:16       3:00 PM rise through. Feel five chivas regal with morning papers, done hills, three 45 cocaine, three 50, another glass of Chevys and other dunhill.

Now it got serious, 10 drops, acid, 11 chartreuse, cocaine, grass, 1130 cocaine, etc. Etc. Midnight Hunter s Thompson is ready to write that is, and then it keeps going on. 1205 to 6:00 AM chartreuse. Cocaine grass. Shiv is coffee, Heineken, clove, cigarettes, grapefruit done hills, orange juice, gin, continuous pornographic movies.

Speaker 3:          01:44:52       Six in the hot tub. Champagne, dove bars, fettuccine Alfredo Alfredo. 8:00 AM Halsey on is that, I say it a sleeping pills. The first. That was before I. Ambien. Yeah. Eight 20 sleep. Wow. Jesus Christ. So I asked the guys, I asked the sheriff's, I'm like, that kid shit's not real. Yeah. There's the, uh, the quote that I po myths and legends die hard in America. We Love them for the extra dimension. They provide the illusion of near infinite possibility to erase the narrow confines of most men's reality. Weird heroes and mold breaking champions exist as proof to those who needed that. The tyranny of the rat race is not yet final. Yeah. I mean, this isn't like that. I mean, that applies to you to do that. I understand that it applies to your life. Yeah. I mean, and that's part of the reason I'm sure why some people were pissed at you. It's like you were a legend with a caveat.

Speaker 1:          01:45:45       Yup. Yeah. I mean the, the, the, the story in its totality, right? If I was just a cyclist, we wouldn't be having this conversation. But, but the cancer part of the story, right, is what everybody really, nobody, nobody could relate to cycling and they got to figure it out. They started to watch it. That cool. You want, again, the cancer part of it, everybody can relate to. Right. I mean, every, everybody is either had the disease themselves or lost a loved one or had a loved one or friend or neighbor affected by it. So they're like, all right, I'm in like, that is some bullshit right there that dizzy. And they rallied around that. And that's, you know, that's, that's why that fall came swift and harsh.

Speaker 3:          01:46:29       Well, there's parallels in life when it comes to this story and a lot of ways because everything is kind of messy, you know, the, the, the, the reality versus the narrative, it's always messy. Yeah. And there's so many variables that don't get discussed, and there's so many aspects of it that they're flexible and they move around and, and that's, yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:46:50       I mean, more and more now, I mean, the transparency we see in our society today, whether it's politicians or politics or sports or entertainment and just, I mean, do, do you imagine, like, I always say like, you know, if, if, if I give you three names that were alive today, like Sinatra, we just, you know, just had celebrated his hundredth birthday [inaudible] you took Sinatra, JFK, and Michael Jordan, and they, and they were at their peak today.

Speaker 2:          01:47:17       TMZ alone would be nuking people. Yeah. And so, uh, it just, it's, it's, we're just getting deeper and deeper into that. Yeah. It's, and I think this is just, there's no end to the beginning. Yeah. Oh, for sure. Well, I think what's going on with technology too is we're seeing this very obvious trend that the boundaries between people and thoughts and ideas and reality and facts. Yep. They're getting smaller and smaller and smaller to the point where they're going to be erased. And I don't know how it's going to happen, but I think it's going to happen with something that connects us and in a much more personal way than peripheral devices like laptops or phones. I think there's gonna be some technology that connects us body to body, whether it's some sort of a neural implant or something along those lines. Yeah. I really do. I think it's on inevitable. Yeah. I mean, the symbiotic relationship that we have with cell phones right now is undeniable. I leave my fault. Like you, you dropped your phone and you're like, fuck, where's my phone? My phone's broken. Fuck, fuck. Fuck

Speaker 1:          01:48:17       no here. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, I dropped it, so I did drop my phone, but I'm like, I'm like fucking scratching myself because I haven't had the phone for like two or three hours. Yeah, dude, it's, that ain't good.

Speaker 2:          01:48:28       No, it's not good. I leave my phone sometimes in the, in the car when I go do the podcast and I don't realize that I left it and I'll be in the middle of a great podcast. Like my phone's not here. I'm not even gonna use it. It's out there. I don't touch it. But the fact that it's not physically like I want it right there.

Speaker 1:          01:48:44       You know you're on here and you just start like, you know you've got some guests on, you're like texting him and the guests will be like, what the fuck? What's he do? Yeah, I come all the way over here. This godforsaken valley and that la traffic

Speaker 2:          01:48:56       and the guy's on his phone. Yeah. Well I have had people that are guests that start checking their twitter. Like Neal Brennan would try and start checking his twitter in the middle of pocket. What the fuck are you doing? I want to see what people are saying about it. Talk to them afterwards. Just flip your people. You don't let people call in and ask questions or ask questions. We've done that before. But the problem is that people that want to do it are usually trolls. You know, some of those might be fun. I like if I wanted that kind of a show, I would do an all call. And she did a talk, I did a talk a couple of couple months ago

Speaker 1:          01:49:26       in Denver and the 600 people and it was kind of a moderated q and a and then we, and then the audience was allowed to ask questions and people were cool. They were asking questions in the moderator says in, there's a line to get to the mic desk questions and the guy says, ah, not that this light, I'm not connecting, you know, calling her a troll. But the guy says, is anybody in really

Speaker 2:          01:49:48       pissed at Lance? And one ask a question, this lady in the back, she's like me, she comes trucking up there. And so, you know, I was like, this is going to be super interesting. Like what the hell is she going to ask me? How am I going to answer it? So I, I, I, you know, maybe I like a challenge, but you definitely like a challenge. I think you're just bored. And between Golf Games you want to spar with somebody verbally ask kids if my phone got fixed. Did he text you? He's probably out there. I looked when I went to them and so the bathroom is a hawk. Cool. Thanks. That's the last thing he said here. I'll text him right now. You are out there who says hot, cool things he did because he said, can, I said you wanted it advil. He says, I said, lance would like you to bring advil.

Speaker 2:          01:50:32       He says, hoc. Cool, thanks. And I said, uh, yeah, it was his birthday last night. We went out to dinner and just we got w way too drunk. It happens. It happens. Um, what we were talking about about technology though about uh, bringing people closer together in this, the fact that there's going to, I mean, I really think there's going to be no secrets. I don't think anybody's going to have secrets from anybody in the future. Right. I think, um, you kind of, you caught like the wave of this trend before it got even crazier than it. I mean, you caught that wave and even in 2012 the comparison between 2012 and 2015 it's like it's ramped up. Consider it for sure and will continue to do that yet. Yeah. There's no getting around it, right? Yeah. Is that good? Is that a good thing or is it just what it is?

Speaker 2:          01:51:26       Yeah. You and I are not going to stop it so that it's inevitable. No one is nobody's. I think it's going to not just, Oh, it's just, it's one of the things it's going to happen is it's not going to just be celebrities. It's not going to be just people like you. People like Michael Jordan or whoever. It's going to be everybody. Right. It's going to be, if you want to find out anything about Jamie, it's going to be all on the table. Maybe Jamie was one of those Ashley Madison Clients. He could have been the odd Wicki was ah, well there had been some fucking ridiculous people that were that one up killing themselves when like preachers and shit like that, that it was found out. But how dumb do you have to be to think that that's going to be secure? You're going to go on some dating site.

Speaker 2:          01:52:09       I mean, come on man. I'm like, Ooh, that's, that's insane. But you know what kind of a fucking Weirdo wants to find out about people that were on the dating site? Like, well, what do you give a shit? Leave me alone. Exactly. But that's not the world we live in. Right. I gotta take a leak again. You do you well, it's what's in this fucking thing. What's in it? Yeah, we're good. We're done. I think 1130 it's 11 supposed to tee off at 1130 but all right, where are you? Really? Yeah, but I'll find it. I'm going to meet him out there. It's all okay. It's all good man. Thank you lance. Really appreciate. Thank you. Thanks for doing that. And thanks for listening, whoever. Hopefully somebody lists. A lot of people are so cool. I'm sure that's it. Bye everybody. Bye. Okay.
